# Flames of War[Casting Call, OR, Open]

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-07-14 11:48:07)

*For more than a decade now, the forces of Mandalore the Ultimate have roamed freely in the Outer Rim, conquering systems and expanding their territory unchecked and unchallenged. Not until they begin to threaten the economically vital world of Taris, does the Republic act. Taris is awarded Republic membership, and the fleet is deployed to form a defensive line to keep attackers at bay. The Mandalorian forces are undaunted, and several skirmishes takes place along the front, with the Republic defenders managing to hold the invaders back, and the grand crusade of the Mandalorians seems to have come to a halt.
Everything, however, was a ruse. In order to mobilize and test the strength of the Republics defenders, Mandalore have kept most of his troops back, feigning weakness. And the Republic took the bait. Unleashing the full fury of his war machine, Mandalore launches a three-pronged attack into Republic space, to shatter and overwhelm the defenders. One of the worlds that finds itself in the path of this relentless onslaught is the small mining colony of Vanquo. A relatively small colony, Vanquo still holds great resource interests for many major corporations on Taris, as well as being a nice place for travelers to stop and hang back on for a couple of days. Up until now…*
OK, so this is my short description of the state of the galaxy as it is now. The year is 3,963 BBY, and the Mandalorians have launched their full-scale invasion of the Republic after laying siege on the Outer Rim for more than a decade. All characters will begin the game on the planet of Vanquo. Read up on it on Wookiepedia if you like, but I think the sentences I posted kind of sums it up.
**<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">Campaign Guidelines</span>**
=======================================================================
**Starting Character Level** 7
**Point Buy** 36 (32 for droids)
**Sources** Any officially published material will be allowed, including errata and web articles.
**Background/Destiny** Destiny
**Hit Points** Take max for each level
**Starting Credits** max starting credits for 1st level class + 10.000for characters that are "freelance". Characters like Jedi, enlisted soldiers or other similar concepts might face other rules, but all in all, things should be balanced
**Character Restrictions** No Mandalorian characters (hopefully no one will question this)
**Character Information Required**

* **Background** - Doesn´t have to be extremely exhaustive, but I would like it to be more than just a couple of sentences. The more you give me to work with, the more I can hopefully work into making the campaign better. One thing that can always be interesting to know is your characters current whereabouts - I´ve told you where you are going to start out, now why are you there?
* **Appearance** - This is helpful for both me and everyone else to know what your character looks like.

=======================================================================
If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I will update this post with new info if required. I am hoping to keep this campaign going for quite a while, so take some extra time on your characters. I set the starting level to 7, but since I ddn´t really get any input on this in the interest check, this can be shifted if people want to start at a different level.

</details>

Lonzo was a lad that just liked shooting, outdoors, sleeping under the stars. He learned hunting early on, got good with any range weapon he picked up, and started taking jobs that let him use his knowledge and skills to his advantage. Pairing his early education on planet with what the military (local militia) gave him, Lonzo rounded out his education as a shooter. But it wasn't all just shoot and no questions, Lonzo really did support law and order, legitimate authority, and defense of homeland. As the Mandalorian war brewed to its current level, Lonzo made sure he would be ready in whatever role he might be called.
Standing 2 meters tall, Lonzo Paden had brown hair, light brown eyes, and a tanned complexion. Clearly he was no stranger to working in the sun, or suns, as the case might be. He’d come to the mining colony of Vanqua seeking employment. He knew there were major corporations involved in the colony, and he wanted to get his foot in their door, hoping to move up in their organization. It was easy enough to get a passage here, half a dozen tourist ships made stops in Vanqua, and it was no real feat to just walk off the ship and seek new employment.

Total: 7350 spent.
Born in the Outer Rim during the onslaught of the Great Sith War, she was orphaned while still an infant. A Jedi Knight found her in the care of a refugee woman. The woman willingly gave her up believing the life of a Jedi would be better than anything she could provide.
Inquisitive, as a word, does not do Marti justice. She had a question for everything. While some teachers welcomed her pursuit of knowledge, others found it to be a distraction from the teachings of the Order. During her ten years as a youngling, she learned more than most others in her group. What little free time they were allowed she spent in the archives, willing to learn from books, holos, or the random Jedi passerby. When it came time to be taken as a Padawan learner by a Knight, she watched as her friends were chosen, and she was not. She was reckless in her actions as a combatant. She was often overconfident with her abilities to manipulate the Force. For those reasons, as well as others, Marti Quintaine failed her Initiate trials.
Disheartened, she sought an audience with the Jedi Council. They explained to her their decision and how they felt the will of the Force had great things planned for her, however, the path of the Jedi would not be walked by her. At the conclusion of the meeting, she was reassigned to the Jedi Service Corps, where in she would undergo more training. Hearing their reasoning rejuvenated Marti's spirits, and she began her new training with a clear and open mind.
Twenty years later
At 34, Marti may no longer resemble the small child she'd once been. But a conversation would reveal that her inquisitive nature has never left her, and has instead served her well. She now serves the Jedi Order as a clandestine courier. Even the Order has times when they would rather not broadcast their presence. As such, it falls on Marti to see that members and briefs of the Jedi Order arrive where they should, in the manner they desire. She was heavily used by the Order over the last several years as tensions around the Galaxy have risen.
At present Marti is awaiting transport back to the Core Worlds. She is on the mining world of Vanquo after delivering a coded datadisc to Jedi Knight Ariq Rimsen, who is undergoing a mission for the Jedi Council. She traveled here as a refugee, and now sits contemplating her next move. She is responsible for finding her own way as it helps to distance her from the Council.
(Story is written with the assumption of having no ship from the council, it could be changed to support any situation on Vanquo.)
Personality: Inquisitive by nature, it was one of several faults that kept her from being accepted as a Padawan. She is friendly and helpful to those who seek it. She strives to prove to others, especially Jedi, that she is one of them even if they don't see it.
Physical Description: She no longer dons the traditional Jedi Robes, having been regulated to a more logistical post. She instead dresses in casual attire, allowing for free movement and easy blending with local denizens. Carried on her back is a large hammer presumably used to fix hull plating on starships.

OK, so that´s two applicants. If you have any builds made, just post them as well, you don´t need to wait for me to approve your concepts.
Also I updated the first post with some additional info about what kind of character information I want to see.

<div style="text-align: center;">
**Daegin Stonefist
Nosaurian
Soildier 7**
</div>

**Appearance:** He stands at 5' 6" and is 170lbs. His skin coloring is a dark green hue and he has light green eyes, and he has a light grey skin around his eyes. His face looks like that of the old English dragons and he has 6 horns that grow on top of his head, the center most two are longer than the others. Scratches can be seen on his horns and he has a long scar that runs from his forehead to his cheek and crosses over his left eye.
**Personality:** He always seems cool and level headed, even with bullets flying over his head. He is always looking for a good fight and will hardly ever back away from a fight. (He doesn't seem to bear any hatred for humans, since the time we are in is from before most of the problems came to fruition on New Plympto.)
**Background:** He was born on New Plympto in a small village that was owned by the Stonefist clan. As he became an adolescent and his feathers molted he began his apprenticeship as a Rikknit harvester. He found out that he enjoyed using the harvest blade. When he turned 16 he started attending public bouts to prove his physical prowess. One day his clan was approached with an offer to marry him to a female from clan Flashheel, that resided in Phemiss, the capital city of New Plympto. He gladly accepted the offer and married Kelyn Flashheel, though he had to move into Phemiss and away from his clan. When he moved to Phemiss he signed on with the cities militia and worked his way up to being one of the militia's squad commanders. Even though he got proficient with blasters and rifles he would always carry a harvest blade on him as back up. He spent many nights on watch, or defending the city from Nosaurian raiders. It seemed to be a good life, until one night when he was out on patrol and the raiders decided to hit with a two pronged attack. The first attack was on a small village just outside of Phemiss and as his watch team was sent out to assist them the second attack happened and hit Phemiss before the rest of the militia could get up to alert status. They ended up defending against both attacks and pushing the raiders away, but there were plenty of casualties that were not avoided. Among those casualties were his own wife. After he got back home and saw what had happened in his own home he put in his resignation. He spent some time mourning his wife and everything he did just seemed to drone on and leave his life unfulfilled. He finally decided that he needed to leave New Plympto and try and start a new life. He caught word that a transport was looking to hire a few extra guards as they transported some medical equipment to Vanquo. He signed on and started his one way trip to his new life as a mercenary.

Having a bit of trouble finishing the character sheet for Myka, nothing I use seems right. I may end up going with a Force Adept with ties to the Jedi Order. Any thoughts on what would be a better fit for the game, I know Myka's a bit of an "out-there" concept.

If you´re having trouble with a build, you can always post it and I (and probably others) will try to help. I don´t really have any suggestions on what would make a better fit for the game, I try to run my games independently of the presence of any particular character type, and let players focus on what they feel like playing. More likely, it will be the choice of characters by the players that influences the game rather than the other way around.
Personally though, I find this particular period in galactic history to be quite interesting for Jedi, what with the schism in the Order and all that.

full character there for your approval, feel free to critique
I'll put up a level progression later, if that helps

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-07-22 23:12:06)

OK, so let´s take this in order:
**Anodyzed**

* Your Reflex Defense should be 19 when flat-footed, not 15
* Your Grapple modifier should be +9
* You should remove any headings under which you have no entries, such as Starship Maneuvers known. Helps keep the sheet clean
* I can´t know for sure since you haven´t noted what stats you increased at level 4 and 8, but assuming they were placed in Dex/Con (optimal placement) you only have a 35 point buy
* Your skill section is also missing

**Parmenter**

* You don´t have any languages listed. You should know Basic, as well as 7 additional languages
* Your Reflex Defense should be 20 (18). I count +7 from level, +1 from class and +2 from dexterity
* Please just list skills you are actually trained in

**Duggs**

* Just list your available Destiny Points, as I prefer to play with secret destinies for characters
* Your "Senses" header is missing
* Shyriiwook should be listed as "understand only"
* Your Reflex Defense when flat-footed should be 18
* Your Hit Points should be 111
* Remember to list the damage type on your unarmed attacks. You only get the increased damage when dealing piercing damage by using your horns in battle, not when for example kicking or punching
* You seem to be one feat short
* You have one too many skills

Feel free to correct me if I´ve missed something or calculated wrong, but this is what I could find. I don´t like to hand out too much credits to start with, so I have decided that you can take the starting credits for your 1st level class and then an additional 10.000 Cr. I´ll add that to the first post.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">KROZZ</span>** CL 7
**Medium Cathar Noble 1 / Jedi 3 /Soldier 3**
**Background:**
Krozz was born to nobility in the planet Cathar. At a young age, his aptitude with the Force was already evident. Though it pained his parents, he was sent to the Jedi Enclave of Dantooine for training. With his natural skill in stealth and his special way with people, the Jedi Council decided that it would be best to train him as a Jedi Sentinel under the careful tutelage of Arkanian Jedi Knight Jarig Zomn.
One night, Krozz was awakened by a nightmare of fire, blood and thunder. With sweat drenching his fur, he stared blankly at the wall trying to figure out the symbolism in his dream. When all communications with Cathar suddenly ceased, he had a hunch that it has something to do with his dream. Somehow, his entire race disappeared from the face of their planet. He asked around for intel and got answers from Ferroh, a fellow Cathar and Jedi who had spoken with several Cathar refugees who managed to flee the planet when the Mandalorians attacked. For two years, hoping that his family made it offworld, he tried in vain to sense them through the Force. Eventually, he had learned to accept their fate.
When the Jedi Council accepted the fact that the Revanchist Movement cannot be stopped, they determined that they need to send someone to infiltrate the organization to feed them information. Krozz was deemed the best candidate because of his race. Although not proven, many suspects that the Mandalorians caused the Cathar's disappearance. With the impending war, he received a crash course in infantry military training.
This mission is his final test for Knighthood. As a parting gift, his master bestowed upon him a Hurikane crystal for his lightsaber. His colleagues in the Technical Division gave him a modified Light Jedi Battle armor to increase his chance of survival in the upcoming war. To compensate for his lack of technical skills, he bought a MerenData S6-Series Security/Maintenance Droid which he fondly calls "Sam".
Upon his acceptance in the Revanchist Movement, he was immediately dispatched for a surveillance mission in the mining world of Vanquo.
**Appearance:**
Standing at 2 meters, Krozz is powerfully built yet moves with feline grace. Belonging to the less leonine appearing subspecies, he has short light brown skin hair and could pass as a human at quick glance.
He keeps his red mane long and braided.
During missions, he dons a streamlined Light Jedi Battle armor for both protection and to hide his identity.

OK, round two of looking things over.
**Anodyzed**

* Since you´ve been given guidelines for starting credits, you can add your equipment section now

**Parmenter**

* Everything seems to check out, but structure your equipment section so it is possible to read where your equipment is stashed - for example, what goes in your utility belt. I use the convention of <Name of Container>[Contents] and Template <Name of Equipment>(Upgrades/Mods/Anything else important, like amount in a credit chip or contents on a datachip) when listing equipment, and I´d suggest you do the same for simplicity.
An example: Hip Holster[Verpine Blaster Pistol(Improved Damage, Pulse Charger)]
**Duggs**

* Your Reflex Defense should be 24(20)
* Remove Climb from your level breakdown in order to avoid future confusion
* Weapons with a stun setting deals their full damage on both settings
* You´ve not listed your attack bonuses
* See my above notes on convention for listing equipment

**KUPALISS**

* Not really sure why you have listed multiple attack bonuses for knives, but they should be +9 in melee and +12 when thrown
* I count a 38 point buy when removing species modifiers form your base stats
* Only list your trained skills
* Your weapons and equipment sections are not consistent with each other, in one you have a DeathHammer, and in the other an Ascension Gun
* Your level breakdown is not consistent with your sheet, as you have Armored Defense in one and Wealth in the other. Your stats indicate you went with Armored Defense (otherwise RD should be 18(15)), and that´s good, since I would not allow you to take Wealth without a very good explanation
* For that matter, your background could stand to be expanded. Not a requirement, but good for the game, and it might be necessary to motivate certain things, and better explain who your character really are. For example, everything about this character screams "fighter", but still he has his first level in Noble and a lot of social and investigative skills - why he has such training and where he has received it are things that definitely belong in a background
* As for equipment, I´m going to give you a special ruling: You get starting credits as if you had started in the Jedi class + 5000 Credits (so 6700 in total), but in exchange I´ll let you get a set of light Jedi Battle Armor for free and you are allowed to choose a crystal other than the traditional Adegan crystal for your lightsaber (among those listed under Traditional Jewels in the book), provided you can motivate how and why you have them in your background.
I was going to try and make individual calls for starting credits depending on character types, but then I got lazy when I saw that I pretty much only had "freelancing" characters. Jedi, for example, should not have a lot of possessions and credits, so I was going to give them a lower amount of starting credits but in exchange they would be allowed access to the more advanced lightsaber construction options. I also hope you´ll find the Jedi Battle Armor a good fit, IMO it suits you even better than the Light Powered Armor, as you don´t use the bonus to Perception checks anyway, and Sense Surroundings offers you the same benefit as low-light vision.
I´m hoping you can accept this reasoning, and I´m sorry for not writing it out clear from the beginning. I will add it to the original post

Vigilance's origins began, as with all Sentinel droids, at a Kellenech Technologies manufactory. However, where ordinary Sentinels were forged, programmed, and shipped out by the legion, Vigilance was designed to be the first step in his model's next evolutionary process. He was equipped with servo-enhancements that allowed for ferocious accuracy, a penchant for explosives, and most importantly: a heuristic processor, which made possible programming that allowed for more adaptability in combat scenario engagements, intelligence in resolving them, and even the ability to translate Mando'a in case in-field interrogations become necessary. In fact, Vigilance's design put him on a competing level with the deadly HK models, however, rather than designed for ultimate lethality, he came with a pre-designation for selfless protection of friendly carbon-based forms (albeit, through deadly means).
However, as admirable a piece of work he was, despite exceptional results in testing abilities, his model was deigned too costly for mass-production and that the singular existing model be scrapped for parts. Vigilance's story might well have ended there if his programmer were a less robo-sympathetic individual. Vigilance escaped the factory, along with his master, becoming fugitives from a multi-planetary robotics corporation.
The two managed to elude the organization for a time, longer still what with the mandalorian war causing a great deal of ruckus across the galaxy. In that time, Vigilance received no memory wipes and, indeed, was taught by his compassionate master the virtues of carbon-based society. In trade for his education, Vigilance was his master's ultimate protector. At least, for a time.
They were found and their hide-away was infiltrated. In the ensuing battle, there was a thermal detonator discharge within close quarters: Vigilance was thrown through a window of plasti-steel and cast down from the tall building structure which had served as their home for the last span of time. The impact from the fall caused an amount of trauma to the droid's heuristic processor and forced Vigilance to shut down.
Hours later, Vigilance woke from the power-down... alive. Between his master's lessons locked in memory and the damage to his processor, Vigilance woke to discover what it was to be free. And at that moment, he was free to feel quite vengeful toward Kellenech Technologies.
There was no sign of his master or his captors left behind in the wreckage of their hideaway. The time came for the hunt to begin...
**Appearance:** Vigilance appears, except for some minor alterations to his chassis, nearly identical to any other standard Sentinel combat droid: a model commonly/ employed by both sides of the war for purposes of security and general protection.
((My first Star Wars sagas character: lemme know if I screwed something up.
Also, details of the backstory might be edited, depending on whether or not a dear friend will apply to this campaign as well)))

I think we're all ready. Is there something else we need to do to help get the ball rolling?
Nope, just wait for me to take care of my crap so I can get back to you <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> I was a little occupied recently, among other things moving back to my own place after the summer, only to find out that our ISP decided my internet access should be spotty for a few days.
So, let´s just iterate on this again:
**Anodyzed**

* From what I calculate, you should only have 5610 Cr left
* By putting on a Tracker Utility Vest, you need to modify your Reflex Defense since you don´t have Armored Defense and it provides an armor bonus. However, since I´m a nice guy, I´ll just tell you how to fix it <!– s:D –>![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!– s:D –> If you use the option to strip the armor of Defensive Materials, you can wear it without penalty (since the bonus would go down to 0). It costs 150 Cr, but you get an additional upgrade slot to compensate as well.
* Lastly, where are you carrying that Fusion Lantern? Seems like a cumbersome thing to haul around <!– s;) –>![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!– s;) –>

**KUPALISS**

* You don´t have to list the armor bonuses in the equipment section, just any templates, upgrades and modifications
* When calculating, I get that you have spent 25 Cr more than you had to start with, assuming that you sold off the Tool Kit from your utility belt

**Redshaw**
Sorry to say it, but you screwed up <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> Being the first character - and a droid - though, no one will make fun of you for it

* It would be nice to know what type of droid it is - since you´+re obviously not using the basic Sentinel droid model. If you used the option to create a custom droid from the SECR, list it as "Medium X-th Degree Droid", and if you used a chassis from the Scavenger´s Guide, list it as "Medium <Chassis Name>"
* While you get DPs to use, you don´t get to choose your destiny, so just leave that blank
* Your Reflex Defense should be 21(18)
* Your HP should be 84
* List all weapons on separate rows for clarity
* I´m running with fractional BaB, so you should have +6. 4 from soldier, 6/4 from Scout and 3/4 from ID = 25/4 ~6
* Droids do not have a Con score. This is why your HP should be lower, but you can add your Str modifier to Fortitude Defense, so that doesn´t have to change
* Without knowing what creation method you used and where you put your ability increases, I can´t verify your point buy, but on a quick glance it looks a bit low. Remember, droids don´t have a Con score, and you only get a 32 PB as opposed to 36 for everyone else
* You have two talents from the ID class, but you only have one level. You should have 2 soldier, 1 scout and 1 ID talent
* You can´t gain Shake it Off since you shouldn´t have a Con score, and you aren´t trained in Endurance either
* You seem to be missing 1 Soldier bonus feat and 1 General level feat
* You have no classes that give you Deception as a class skill, and unless you gained a new skill from increasing Int, you can´t be trained in Use Computer either, as it´s not a Scout skill
* Without knowing your choice of creation method, I can´t really verify credits either, but see my previous notes to the others on conventions for how to list equipment

So taking another 150 off the credits for the vest mod that leaves Lonzo with 5460 credits. As for the Lantern, it weighs 2 kg, so not so heavy, I imagined it fit into the utility belt. No? Can delete it then and Lonzo will find some other light source that does fit into the Utility belt or vest.

Bonuses removed from the item list. I did sold off the Tool Kit since I'm not trained in Mechanics. Ditching some knives....

The utility belt pouches specify that they can hold up to 0.5 kgs each, so it doesn´t fit. You could of course just tie it to the belt and have it dangle freely, and that was what I was thinking would be kind of clumsy to run around with. Not in any mechanical way, but from a RP perspective I just have some experience that carrying something like that is not something I would recommend.
If you´re looking for alternatives, you already have a Glow Rod in your utility belt, but if you´re looking for something that spreads light in a radius, I´d recommend the Halo Lamp from Clone Wars CG. Only half the light radius, but fits in the palm of a human hand or as a weapon accessory.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-08-17 16:39:52)

OK, so while we iterate through this character creation process, I thought I should bring up some other things:
First, I will try to get this set up to start around the 26th or so. I have my last exam for right now on the 24th, and the 25th is dedicated to celebrating that. So, you know, try to have everything done by then. I´ll most likely sit down during the night of the 24th to check on things, so if you get things in by then I´ll have time to give them a final check and then hopefully you can correct any notes before the 26th. So if you had a friend that might want in Redshaw, that´s the deadline I´m hoping we can keep.
Second, I´ve taken a look through your backgrounds to make sure we´re somewhat on the same page regarding the state and recent events in the Galaxy.
**Parmenter** - If she was born during the Great Sith War, Marti would be at least 33, given that that war ended in 3,996 and it is now 3,963
**KUPALISS** - Technically, the truth about what occurred on Cathar is not public knowledge at this time, though I´m guessing at least the Revanchist suspects what has happened. It would make sense though that Krozz would have felt a powerful disturbance in the Force when his people were massacred, and would likely be pretty convinced about what has happened, even though he has no proof. Also, at this point, the Revanchist are not actively sanctioned by the Council, and are mostly assisting in scout missions at the front, though I suppose it doesn´t really matter, and you can still have him being an informant for the Council as part of your history if you want.

### **Parmenter** (2012-08-17 21:15:05)

I think her age was a remnant of the last time I tried to play this character, the time setting was nearly the same. But as is obvious now, not exactly the same. I'll change her age in the background.

Finally finished all your requested edits, Anthrax. My mate is still in the midst of creating a very fun character for you and is fining out the inventory details even as I type this. Lemme know if something doesn't check out and I'll hop to it. Wasn't sure if you wanted me to price out the standard droid equipment (arms, legs, etc.) so I left em blank and the Self-Destruct option in the core book doesn't seem to list a price...

You don´t have to price out the things you get for free, that´s just confusing. The Self-Destruct System has a cost of 720 Cr for a Medium droid and a weight of 3.6 kgs (pg 195, SECR)

Edited my background for your approval.
Good luck on your exam.

### **Redshaw** (2012-08-22 16:52:20)

After some review of my options, I decided to drop Vigilance's 2 levels in scout and replaced them with 2 levels of Scoundrel, in preparation for an eventual delve into the Assassin prestige class. I believe I've made all the necessary changes to skills, talents, saves, etc. but I figured you'd like to double check nonetheless.
Looking forward to this game with much anticipation.

I would have guessed Gunslinger as the progression of choice with that build, but Assassin has some things going for it as well. You´re still missing a talent to qualify though. And don´t worry if you missed something, I´ll make a final check on all characters before approving them.

I know, but I can't switch to assassin til I have 4 scoundrel levels anyway, I think. Sounds good.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-08-23 06:35:45)

As far as I can tell, you only need the Dastardly Strike talent to qualify for Assassin, and that could be gained by just one more level of Scoundrel, or by taking it as your Scoundrel talent instead of what you have taken now.

### **Redshaw** (2012-08-26 15:33:46)

That's what I get for relying on a shoddy excel creator. Alrighty, I don't want to lose the awesomeness that is Advantageous Strike, so I'll stick to Scoundrel for one more level then hop on the Assassin train.
Unfortunately, the program my friend collected his new character sheet on crashed while he was saving and lost all the data. That, combined with the distraction of Guild Wars 2, knocked him out of the running it appears, so it's just us.

Yeah, never trust a program to do something you can easily do yourself, that´s been my biggest tip to new players all the time. As a personal preference, I´d do Dastardly Strike over Advantageous Opening any day, but that´s just my preference.
On a sidenote, it seems like our partying took me out for the entire weekend - more or less - so I´ll be finalizing all the details today, including getting us a forum. But don´t worry, we will start in a few days.

I feel ya. Sadly, he and I are Heroforge spoiled. We've been using that for years of 3.5 gaming, ha ha. I bet he still could have turned something out if not for GW2 release: I've barely heard a word from him since his head-start server went live. Alas.

### **Anodyzed** (2012-08-27 17:59:23)

Back in the day when you could generate a character in a few minutes, with pen and paper, it was no big deal.
But nowadays all the companies expect a player to be a Frickin' bookkeeper, just to keep track of the "every third level after ..." ad naseum. Its tedious, it takes away from the gaming experience for me to toil over a bunch of BS details when all I really want to do is game. And by game I mean social gaming, not sitting in front of a single player game (which I equate to solitaire). I think the newer games (Pathfinder, SAGA) are great, but it really does require a program to keep a character up to date with all the stuff you have to sift through. I just wish there was a decent SAGA module for HeroLab. That would be fantastic!

---

### **Parmenter** (2012-08-27 18:41:10)

I like the Saga Omega Dex for looking stuff up in a hurry, but in most cases I know where stuff is already.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-08-27 20:10:45)

Quite frankly, I had a thought back when it all began to try and throw together some homemade character creator for SAGA, but didn´t bother. The main reason I didn´t bother was because creating a character in SAGA was so incredibly simple that using a program to do it seemed completely redundant to me and would only introduce errors. Which is why I´ll stick to the same advice I´ve been giving everyone so far: ditch whatever program you are using, make a couple of characters on your own, from level 1, up to whatever level you want them to be, and you´ll have the hang of it in no time.
Now I know it is probably a lot in my nature that I enjoy making characters and experimenting with concepts and optimization, but the very essence of making a character in SAGA can be distilled down into less than 10 points that you simply repeat when adding a new level. What really takes time is optimization, but that is optional, and if you already know your concept, whipping up the character is only a matter of minutes. And it only gets simpler the more you do it.
I even think we had a guide here somewhere that I wrote at one time in the past...

You have the 1.9 version of the OmegaDex?
I wrote an 'index' for the OmegaDex. Found that it was SO big, that IT needed its own index! I just have to number the pages by hand after printing, then its a great resource! Of course, I have the whole set of books, too!

There's a set of Indexes made with Excel too which I love to use: <!-- m -->[https://www.dropbox.com/s/69ztctq8ivxue &#8230; 0Files.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/69ztctq8ivxuep3/SAGA%20Index%20Files.zip "https://www.dropbox.com/s/69ztctq8ivxuep3/SAGA%20Index%20Files.zip")<!-- m -->

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-08-28 19:34:22)

Alright, I´ll just go ahead and do my final check of your characters now. Anyone cleared can post their character in the appropriate forum (once I fix one), and when everyone is ready, we can get this show on the road.
**Anodyzed**

* You still have the issue of your Reflex Defense to deal with. As it currently stands, with an unmodified armor and without Armored Defense, your Reflex Defense should be 16 (13)
* Your Hit Points should be 99 not 103
* You seem to be one feat short
* You should only have 5610 Cr left

**Parmenter**

* Nothing to remark on, you can go ahead and post your character once I get a forum and appropriate thread up

**Duggs**

* Vibro-Ax damage should be 2d10+9, since you can´t wield it in one hand
* You seem to have forgotten your half level bonus to all skills
* From what I can tell you should have either 1200 or 300 Cr on hand, depending on what datapad model you have

**KUPALISS**

* You should have 8 FP
* You can´t have both an integrated Breath Mask and Environmental Sealing on the armor as it only has one upgrade slot available
* Discarding the Breath Mask + 1 slot of integrated equipment, you should have 175 Cr left

**Redshaw**

* You should know 1 more language
* Reflex Defense should be 21 (18)
* Hit Points should be 76
* All attack bonuses and Grapple modifier should be +9
* From my calculations, you should have 950 Cr left

These notes were made from your current versions of your character sheets. Please let me know if you make any changes other than these fixes. Otherwise you may post your sheets in the appropriate thread when you have fixed them (and the thread is there)

I can't believe I made such a simple mistake. (Talking about with the skill levels.) It should be all fixed now.

* I spent 1 FP to attune my self-built lightsaber unless you deem it free for starting characters
* Sorry, I thought the description in the Core book p. 137 means the breath mask can be installed with no upgrade slot requirement.
* I tried to recompute my gear. I ended up with 425cr left. Did I miss anything?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-08-30 08:29:43)

Sorry, my bad. I see now you sold off the Tool Kit from the belt, which makes up the difference.
The FP is right as well, it should be gone. Since S&V wasn't out, I doubt anything in SECR would refer to its upgrade system.
You're good to go

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-02-05 18:20:14)

OK, so I´m looking for 1-2 players to join the fray of this game. Any information you need can be found in the first post in this thread, and if you have any questions, ask them here or PM me.

---

### **Halfbat** (2013-03-01 17:39:24)

Hi,
I'm assuming this is Saga edition? If so, are you still looking for players? The KotOR supplement is one of the few I do not have, however, so a character would come from the core rules plus some of the other supplements.

Yes, this is for SAGA edition. If you don´t have the KOTOR book that´s fine, there are no restrictions on what supplements you may use. There are still a few slots open, so if you want to submit a concept that is fine. You should find all the information you need in the first post of this thread, and if you have any questions, ask them here.

### **Halfbat** (2013-03-01 19:56:29)

Thanks. Before I start, I now will be able to get hold of KotOR.
I'm thinking of playing an Arkanian Corporate Agent, or a Serv-O-Droid R8009 Droid (prolly Scout/Scoundrel) or an indepedent HK-51 (prolly Soldier/Scout plus Prestige Class), one of the few experimental prototypes derived from HK-50s that were developed by GoTo with better translator units and upgraded tactical-initiative software (which were ultimately abandoned when they proved to have _too much_ free will and independent thought). However, the latter is by GM permission only (see HK-Series). Would this be ok?

I usually allow players to go for whatever they want, but I have to say no on the HK-51 concept, simply for timing reasons. This campaign is set during the very early stages of the Mandalorian wars, which is way before the HK-50 series came into production.

### **Halfbat** (2013-03-02 08:12:15)

Oh, sure. I'll have fun looking at seeing what I can do building my own type-4 combat/security droid. 1m90 tall (>6'), bulky, could be intimidating but resembles a simple worker droid with unspecific tool attachments as well as strong arms. I'll use the 32-pt buy and the standard 1,000 for a droid build plus the starting 3,000 for Soldier as his basic, built-in equipment (makes sense to me, if that's ok) and only purchase additional stuff or simple upgrades with the 10K we're allowed (plus a speeder bike, probably, and an S6). What do you think?
The Arkanian would make sense if he worked (or still works) for Adascorp - it has (had!) strong links with Vanquo anyway. I'll see how he turns out, apart from haughty and seemingly detached, of course!

---

### **Halfbat** (2013-03-03 19:15:45)

First, droid soldier character (E4) sent in draft to DA; Second, Arkanian noble/Adascorp Pharmaceuticals Corporate Agent (Sulan), is well underway and will be sent Monday. Really enjoying building SW Saga characters, again.
Sulan may be a better fit with the characters we have as he is focussing more on skills (11-12 of with an Arkanian's Int of 20) and he was involved with emergency medical efforts on Cathar. There is also a stronger character shape, though his background is shorter than E4's! I'll leave DA to recommend which would fit in better with the campaign/PC group, though, and I will be "guided" by his preference. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

I really should make a disclaimer about this somewhere in my sig or in my casting calls...asking me which of your character ideas you should choose for a campaign I´m running always have and always will be answered with the phrase "Whichever one you want to play the most"

LMAO... I get that same response from most GMs when I tell them I have 2 or more concepts to throw at them.

---

### **Halfbat** (2013-03-04 19:52:35)

okay. Not very decisive, atm - though I always want to play every character I generate!
I'll run with the Arkanian as there is already a soldier-like droid and I can't see a medic/agent. Just check him and I'll keep the droid as a ready-to-use spare.
Looking forward to starting. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **Anonymous** (2013-03-09 16:57:43)

I am new to this forum and fairly new to the Star Wars Roleplay system. That said, I am a fan of the Star Wars genre and am moderately fluent in the movies, games and some of the books. I am familiar with this timeline as it is pre-SWKotor game. It is around the time of the rise of Revan and the Exile from Swkotortsl.
As to myself, I am one of the original members of Mayhemgaming forums, and have been Roleplaying since the beginning of D&D back in the early 70's.
I am called Daern and have been called by that name in gaming circles for 40 years.
I am interested in your forum and would like to try it, and hopefully bring over some of the mayhem people as well in time. I am currently running a Star Wars Play by Post on mayhem set in the SWTOR time line.
At present I only have the basic Star Wars roleplaying book, however I may be able to find links to other sources online or would take any help offered. I learn fairly quick.
Now to my question. Is the game still open and if so, would you be willing to take on a new player. {And by new, I do mean new lol.- I have experience with roleplaying and from what I have read on this forum, it seems that people here write story rather than two lines per post. I like that.}
As to a concept, From what I have seen, and please correct me if I am wrong, There are no full jedi as of yet, or primary jedi. I realize that your using multiclass rules and it seems to be recommended by the posts I have seen.
As to a concept, I have something in mind, but would like to find out if there is still an opening for me to try it.
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
Sincerely;
Daern.

### **daern** (2013-03-10 01:45:54)

I just joined the forum today, and I would like to know if you are still in need of a player or not?
I have very little experience with the Star Wars Roleplay game system though I do have the Saga rule book which I purchased about a month or two ago. I am however very familiar with the
Star Wars universe, having read several of the books and having seen all 6 movies. I also am familiar with the setting you have chosen as it is just prior to SWKOTOR and SWKOTORTSL.
It is pre-Revan time or rather pre-Revan as a sith time. I have an idea about what I would like to do, however before wasting your time and mine, I thought I would ask if you still had room.
As to my experience as a Roleplayer, I have been roleplaying since the first days of D&D with Gary Gygax. I have run many games over the years and played in to many to count, unfortunately
I have yet to play in a Star Wars game. I am running one on Mayhem Gaming site however it is not using Saga rules, but my own variation of those. However my game is set in the time of SWTOR.
Please let me know if you have room and would allow me to play. I can get a character created fairly quickly I THINK lol, and though I may be a bit slow at first with rules, I will do my best not to ask TO
many questions.
Please feel free to drop me an IM, or check out my games on Mayhem gaming forum.
Thank you for your time and attention;
Sincerely;
Daern

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-10 06:53:56)

I could take one more player for sure, that would give a total of five, which I think is a good number. I´ve got another player applying for a spot as well, and I´ve been thinking on how to introduce him into the game, and it could be possible to introduce you guys at the same time. It don´t really matter if you are overly familiar with the rules or not, SAGA is quite easy to get into, and if you have any questions, there are plenty of people here on the site to help.
Whip up a character, and I´ll help you get it right.

---

### **daern** (2013-03-10 16:23:53)

Thanks a lot.
I will work on the character today, and pm it to you and to Halfbat who has already PM'd me offering to help.
Don't want to clutter the board with a bad build, aka a wrong one. I know how fast threads can get messy.
LOL.
Thanks again.
Daern

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-10 16:56:51)

That´s pretty much what these threads are for, and besides, if you put it here you can probably get help quicker, since more people than me will be able to see it and offer your help.

### **daern** (2013-03-11 00:39:24)

OK, Here it is. I am not sure if I got it all right, but it should be close.
Dae el Tor
Human
Jedi 7
Appearance: Dae stands 2 meters {6’4+”} tall and is well muscled, weighing 90 Kilograms {200 lbs}. He has Ash blond hair and white blue eyes. He is dressed in a black flight suit style outfit covered by a dark gray black hooded robe. He carries no visible weapons but to the trained observer he has a light saber attached to his side.
Personality: Dae is a quiet, soft spoken individual with a deep gentle voice. He never seems to show anger other than to become emotionless. He is one to always seem calm in a crisis and yet will be one of the first to take action.
Background: Dae was born on Alderaan, son of Elise Organa, who was the younger sister of Lord Bael Organa, head of house Organa, and Rand el Tor, one of the palace guards. As the nephew of the lord of house Organa, Dae had a somewhat privileged life, living in the palace with his father and mother. When Dae was little more than 5 cycles old, a Jedi by the name of Vash was sent to mediate the latest clan war between house Turek and house Organa. It turned out that Vash was in fact a Jedi master and while mediating the final treaty, Dae pointed to a human who looked to be of house Organa and asked who the bad man was. This simple child like question caused Vash to look at the man just in time to thwart the assassination attempt on Lord Bael Organa by that man. When Vash later tested Dae, she found that he not only possessed a sensitivity to the force, but a strong connection to it. Vash took Dae with him to the enclave on Dantooine to train as a Jedi, where he became the padawan of Master Kavar. Dae trained along with many other students and by the age of 15 was found to be very strong in the force as well as well on his way to becoming a master swordsman. Dae had a few friends in the enclave including one who would later come to be known as Revan, though he was particularly close to a young woman named Bastila Shan. Though he was several years older than her, they seemed to share an affinity with the force. He also became close to a Jedi woman named Atris. The two could often be seen together studying the ways of the force and both had a passion for holocrons.
By the time Dae had reached his mid 20’s he had become one of the finest swordsman at the enclave. After having completed much of his training, Dae was brought before the Jedi counsel of Dantooine, where Masters Vrook, Kavar, Vash, Zez-Kai Ell, Dorak Quinn, Zhar Lestinsent and Vandar would give him several tests. During one such test, Dae surprised the masters by constructing his own lightsaber even though he had yet to be trained in such techniques.Upon the completion of those tests, Dae was sent with Masters Vash and Vrook on several assignments. It was on one such assignment, that Master Vash seemed to have a vision through the force. She sent Dae alone to a remote colony on the outer rim known as Vanquo. She did not tell him why she had sent him there, but instead told him to trust in the force to guide him. She never told him of the vision which she had seen, nor of the destiny that she had witnessed for him. Never told him of the shared vision she and Master Kavar had had on Dantooine years earlier which would haunt them both for years to come.

@Daern: You seemm to be feat-light. You have the humman bonus feat but seem to be missing the level-dependent feats given at levels 1,3,5,7 (see page 37 in Saga Core).

---

### **Halfbat** (2013-03-11 08:47:03)

Just for info, as I've given Sulan to DA to approve/find errors with, Dr Sulan is an Arkanian, son of a senior board member of Adascorp. He is 54, light build (1m83, 72kg), pale skinned and white hair and eyes. He has a butler, a Cathar, as he feels a duty to protect them having assisted in the post-destruction medical teams and, subsequently, the Cathar's evacuation of their home world. So he hates Mandalorians, having seen their casual disrespect for life. Having also lived through the atrocities of the Sith and Krath Wars, he is also deeply distrustful of Dark-side force users. He comes across as arrogant as many Arkanians, but is placid and highly persuasive in his arguments; conversely, he is extremely hard to convince, a trait that many attribute to his Arkanian heritage.
Sulan is known as one of the top surgeons in Adascorp and across Vanquo and Taris, plus other planets on which Adascorp has a major presence. His butler/drive and he carry loads of medical gear. He is also a superb linguist.
@Darth Anthrax: Oops. Just noticed I accidentally copied over the Droids special actions. He doesn't have those, of course!
@All: I'm currently suffering from major nerve problems so can't type too well and my laptop, which has my speech recognition installed, has had to go in for repair. Please forgive any typing errors!

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-11 10:04:36)

**@Daern** - Just like Halfbat said, you seem to be missing all your level feats (1st, 3rd and 6th levels). Also, while your build may check out (will do a full check after you add in the missing feats), your breakdown does not. You can´t take Weapon Specialization before Weapon Focus, or Redirect Shot before Deflect. Finally, Force Training is *not* a bonus feat for Jedi.
**@Halfbat** - I noticed that, and should have my notes for you later today. Hopefully things get better on your end =)

@Daern
Weapon Focus is a feat
Weapon Specialization is a talent
Do this and it works out:
Level 1 talent Deflect
Level 4 feat Weapon Focus
Level 5 talent Weapon Specialization
Edit: the crystal can be found in the Jedi Academy source book.

IF It is possible I would like to add to my items a crystal for my lightsaber as well.
Preferred choice would be a Lorrdian Gemstone {+1 bonus on all Defenses, and a +2 bonus on attempts to use Block or Deflect.}
Second choice would be Opila {+2 to damage, and if a critical hit is rolled, the weapon deals +2d6 additional damage.}
Third choice would be Solari {+2 to damage and to hit rolls. Against anyone with a Dark side score, the lightsaber deals an additional +1d8 points of Force damage.}
I can come up with an appropriate part of the background to cover how he got the crystal.
If it is not possible to have one, that is ok too.

Not sure what you´ve found, but that is not the Jedi Academy Sourcebook. Given the bonuses you describe the crystals giving, it sounds more like some fan-made thing based on the crystal effects from KOTOR2, and I don´t allow non-official sources for my games. Not to mention those things are quite far out of line with the crystals from the official book. The more I think about it though I become tempted to revisit and complete my old list of lightsaber crystals, which will revise quite a few of the crystals found in the book, as well as add many new ones.
Having a crystal on the other hand is ok, since that was one of the compromises for Jedi not having as many starting credits. Since the acquiring of a crystal and construction of a lightsaber should be a big event in any Jedis life, this is quite a typical thing I would expect to go into your background.

Interesting hyper-powered Crystals! As DrathAnthrax says, the bonuses seem to be huge related to the sourcebooks. For your info, the real values are:
In KotOr, p.67, it lists Opila as giving +1 die of damage on a critical;
In KotOr, p.67, Solari grants the user a +2 force bonus to Use the Force when using Deflect;
I'll check up the Llordian Gem comes from.
Edit: More difficult than it seems! Wookieepedia doesn't even list it.

I got those from an online post for Star wars roleplaying game.
I have gone through the Star Wars D6 Jedi Academy Sourcebook 3 times now page by page and have found no crystals.
As I said, it is not a huge deal, I just thought if a character who was Jedi level 3 had a crystal, perhaps Dae could.
Just did a broader spectrum search and found the book. My confusion was in name, The book is titled,
Star Wars Roleplaying Game, Jedi Academy Training Manuel. Saga D20 system.
I am going over it now, and will edit my character sheet using that as a guide, IF that is acceptable.

Thanks Alicia. That was nice of you to send.
As to the crystal, if allowed I would like a Krayt Dragon pearl, +3 to damage as first choice, I can come up with an interesting background story to go with this,
if not, then please let me know what restrictions I have to choosing a crystal.
Also Dae will have Guilt a dueling lightsaber.
Thanks, Looking over that book and another and will submit new sheet in next day or two.
Thanks for bearing with me.

### **daern** (2013-03-13 00:24:41)

OK, third time is the charm? I hope so. LOL.
Here goes nothing. Let me introduce the new improved and HOPEFULLY correct, Dae el Tor.
Dae el Tor
Human {+1 skill, +1 feat.}
Jedi 7
Appearance: Dae stands 2 meters {6’4+”} tall and is well muscled, weighing 90 Kilograms {200 lbs}. He has Ash blond hair and white blue eyes. He is dressed in a black flight suit style outfit covered by a dark gray black hooded robe. He carries no visible weapons but to the trained observer he has a light saber attached to his side.
Personality: Dae is a quiet, soft spoken individual with a deep gentle voice. He never seems to show anger other than to become emotionless. He is one to always seem calm in a crisis and yet will be one of the first to take action.
Background:
Dae was born just 5 years after the end of the Great Sith War, on the planet Onderon, in the year 3991BBY. He was the son of the Onderon royal handmaiden assigned to take care of Prince Vaklu. During Dae’s early years, Vaklu took great pleasure in tormenting the young handmaidens son, constantly pointing out that he was of a lower class. When Dae was 5 years old, the Princess Talia was born. With two young royals to care for, Dae’s mother often took him with her and soon Dae was helping with the care of Talia, again much to the delight of Vaklu, who decided it was immensely funny to call Dae a handmaiden. With trade routes in shambles after the Great Sith War, and pirate activity high, the Onderon royal house had kept out of interstellar matters for the most part, and worked on the recovery from the war. It was on Dae’s 10th year of life that a Jedi Knight by the name of Kavar arrived from Coruscant on a diplomatic mission. It was on a tour of the city, one which prince Vaklu had invited himself, and one which the queen had insisted that her heir, the princess Talia must attend even at the tender age of 5, thus requiring the presence of Dae and his mother, that Dae’s life would change forever. As the air car was traveling through the cities merchant quarter, the pilot of the craft was shot from an unseen location. Dae, who had been standing behind the pilot at the time, took the controls and managed to safely land the craft, guiding it an intricate pattern which made further assassination attempts futile. Kavar noticed this and yet was silent until, when a few days later, Kavar and the queen were meeting in the royal throne room of Onderon, Dae would push the queen out of the path of another blaster shot. Kavar was swift in his action and was able to apprehend the assassin, though the assassin had taken some form of poison, and died before he could be questioned. Kavar decided to test the young lad, Dae, to see if his suspicions were correct. They were and Kavar arranged to take the young lad, who was only 10, and yet already older than most who were accepted, to the Jedi enclave on Dantooine. There Dae was tested once more by the Jedi masters Vandar, Vrook, and Zez-Kai Ell. Not only was Dae found to have a connection to the force, but he was found to have a strong one as well as having already formed a tentative force bond to Kavar. It was decided that despite his age, he would be trained as a Jedi.
Though Dae was trained by many teachers during the next 15 years, among those were Jedi Masters Vrook, Dorak Quinn, Zhar Lestinsent and one who would later become known as Darth Traya; he spent most of his training years as the padawan of Kavar. Dae also trained alongside many other students during those years, including Atris, who shared his passion for holocrons, a young girl named Bastila Shan, Malak, and one who would later be called Darth Revan. Dae and Bastila become close friends during that time, and he and Atris became especially close. In fact, few were more happy for or proud of Atris when she was made a full Jedi Knight than Dae. During those years, Dae was a good student, though not as strong in the force as Revan, he was strong in it and proved to be very gifted, especially as a swordsman.
By the time Dae had reached his mid 20’s he had become one of the finest swordsman at the enclave, and had gone on several missions with his master, Kavar. It was decided that Dae would soon have to go through his final trials and so he was assigned to a new master, Vash. Vash was a newly risen Jedi Master, one of the youngest to achieve that rank in over a century and she was an acknowledged diplomat as well as a master of several force techniques. Dae would accompany master Vash on several missions over the next few years to complete his training. It was on one of those missions, a reconnaissance mission to the outer rim world of Tatooine where Dae’s life would change forever.
Master Vash and Dae had come to Tatooine to investigate the reports of Krayt dragons attacking settlements in the Mos Eisley area. While Krayt dragons were known to be aggressive, it was a rare thing for one to attack so near a settlement, and an unheard of thing for one to attack numerous times. The Czerka corporation had filed a request with the senate on Coruscant and master Vash had been sent by the Jedi counsel. Upon arrival Vash sensed a dark presence in the area near the attacks and soon she and Dae had found the lair of the Krayt dragon. Vash’s suspicions had been correct, for near the cave were two women, one older and one younger, Dathomir witches. The two attacked Vash and Dae immediately, and the battle looked to be relatively even until the younger of the two witches, a girl named Narleiss, lashed her force whip through the handle of Dae’s lightsaber, destroying it, and then in an arc which would have struck master Vash from behind. Dae moved to intercept the attack and caught the force whip on his arm. Much to the surprise of the witches, not to mention Vash, the whip did not cut off Dae’s arm, but instead seemed to fizzle, as if it’s energy were somehow being dissipated. While the younger witch was stunned Dae used the force to pull her whip from her hand and used that whip to help master Vash disarm the older witch. This should have marked the end of the battle however, the elder witch had one last trick up her sleeve and using her control over beasts, she summoned the Krayt dragon from its lair. The witch gloated as Vash and Dae stood face to face with a Krayt dragon armed only with Vash’s lightsaber and the two force whips which Dae had taken from the witches. Even as Vash moved to draw the dragon’s attention, the witches started tossing the few rocks around the cave entrance at Vash, creating a whirlwind of debris. Dae was also in a smaller whirlwind, and yet he moved closer to Vash’s side. As the Krayt dragon opened it’s great maw to swallow them whole, Dae used the force to send the remains of his lightsaber, along with the two force whips of the witches into its gullet. As the whips entered the dragon’s throat, Dae used the force to activate both whips, one of which lanced into the power cell of his lightsaber. The resulting explosion set off not only his lightsaber’s power cell, but the power cell’s of the two whips as well, literally blowing the dragon’s neck out from the inside. The explosion also killed the older of the two witches, and left the young one dazed. At that moment, a baby Krayt dragon exited the cave, looking for its mother. Dae convinced Vash not to kill the innocent baby dragon. It was the younger witch, Narleiss, however who offered a solution. She would help them lead the baby dragon out into the dune sea, where it could harm no one. She also asked Vash to cut open the carcass of the mother Krayt dragon. Intrigued, Vash did as asked and once she had done so, Narleiss used the force to draw forth a Krayt dragon pearl from inside. She presented this to Dae saying simply that he had earned it. Again Vash was intrigued by the younger witches actions, and thus, after the trio had lead the baby dragon out into the dune sea and found it a suitable cave and food, allowed Narleiss to go free. She and Narleiss had gone outside of the cave to speak of this and something else, while Dae had remained inside of the cave with the baby Krayt dragon. Oddly the two seemed to get along. Dae would never know what it was the two had spoken of, but upon Vash’s return she and Dae returned to Mos Eisley and their transport, leaving Narleiss to her own devices. It was while enroute back to Dantooine, that Dae surprised Master Vash by building his own lightsaber using the Krayt dragon pearl. As the two arrived upon Dantooine Master Vash seemed to have a vision through the force. She said nothing to Dae, but left him on the landing platform and went immediately into the counsel chambers. Dae had no more than finished with the post flight checks and having the transport sent to its hanger when master Vash exited the enclave and came to him. She sent Dae alone to a remote colony on the outer rim known as Vanquo. She did not tell him why she had sent him there, but instead told him to trust in the force to guide him. She never told him of the vision which she had seen, nor of the destiny that she had witnessed for him. Never told him of the shared vision she and Master Kavar had had on Dantooine years earlier which would haunt them both for years to come.

Drop the Deflect and Redirect shot as they should not be there, and I know Weapon Focus lightsaber should be in talents. Corrected them on my note sheet on computer. sorry for mistakes.

AS per my post above....
Weapon Focus = Feat
Weapon Specialization = Talent
I'd take a look at my post again from earlier to get an idea on how to get your breakdown right even though you did trade out Deflect and Redirect, the breakdown should come out the same by switching around the talents you put in their place. Just make sure you take the Focus (feat) before the Specialization (talent).
You'll get there!

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-03-13 12:33:00)

To assist you on the starting credits and available crystals allowed by DA, here's his ruling on the matter:
> **DarthAnthrax wrote:**
>
> As for equipment, I´m going to give you a special ruling: You get starting credits as if you had started in the Jedi class + 5000 Credits (so 6700 in total), but in exchange I´ll let you get a set of light Jedi Battle Armor for free and you are allowed to choose a crystal other than the traditional Adegan crystal for your lightsaber (among those listed under Traditional Jewels in the book), provided you can motivate how and why you have them in your background.

To list the the Traditional Crystals:

Durindfire
Firkraan
Hurikane (which I chose)
Jenraux
Kasha
Opila
Phond
Rubat
Sigil
Solari
Krayt Dragon Pearl is under the Extremely Rare Crystals category which I assume to be off limits to us.
Further, equipment granted to us Jedi will be on a case to case basis which would depend on our build. In my case, I was offered a free Jedi Armor by the GM.

---

### **daern** (2013-03-13 14:19:06)

By my count, I have spent 5,600 credits on equipment and have not taken any armor.
3,000 for dueling lightsaber, 1,000 for holoprojector personal, 1,000 for datapad, 500 for utility belt, and 100 for all weather cloak.
If the GM says I can not have the Krayt Dragon Pearl, that is ok, I will rewrite the background to take the Sigil crystal, which has a +2 to damage instead of a +3.
As to the rest of my credits, I either have 1,100 credits left, or 5, 100 depending on whether the money is refunded for not taking armor, or unless the GM suggests I need armor.
Thanks for the help.

### **daern** (2013-03-14 01:26:22)

Thank you, I hope the GM approves me so I can join the game. I have read what has been posted so far, and it looks interesting, I do like the style it is being run with.
It is a bit like my own Star Wars game on Mayhem, however I set mine in the Old Republic setting. And before anyone wonders how I can run a game in Star Wars when I don't know the rules yet and up until
the help I have gotten here, did not have any book but the basic one.
I CHEATED. LOL.
I created my own rules set. A very simple set of rules that seems to work so far in a PBP. Very few rolls needed and advancement is not set by exp but by chapter and skill/ability used. AKA after each chapter, the characters
advance in one or two skills/abilities by a set number. From 1-10 depending on how well they roleplayed. The first chapter, when it ends, will give them a great deal, as it will give them the jedi class.
The game started out with no jedi starting class, and each character {I will point out, all want to be jedi LOL} chose a starting class that was non jedi. It sort of fits the Old Republic setting, at least to my thinking.
Anyhow I ramble on.
thanks for the help and welcome. Hopefully I will get approval or modification from the GM and can join your game.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-18 18:58:13)

Wow, this is interesting, four people interested in joining. Definitely won´t take on that many additional characters, but two more will suffice.
Just as an information for everyone, casting calls are not generally based on a first come basis, if there are more applications than open slots, then the GM (in this case me) will make a choice among the submitted applications. This means that as long as a casting call is open, you are free to submit an application.

**Description**
A 1st degree bipedal humanoid droid of 1.8 meters. Originally a model designed for scientific data analysis it has been upgraded over the years since it received sapience. The body plating has been re-painted in a matte black with dark grey accents at the joints. It's head resembles that of a human in shape and size without all the detail, while it's photo-receptors glow a dark red.
**Background**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Originally designed as a scientific analysis droid Xrae was repurposed by an ambitious Republic ship captain to assist in battle planning. He was slightly reprogrammed and upgraded with additional equipment to provide such information. With the additional data in his memory core on tactics combined with social sciences he would be able to predict battle tactics in real time.
He served on the republic ship for the captain for several years assisting during small skirmishes very successfully. Unfortunately when the ship encountered Mandalorians he was unable to provide reliable information having not being programmed with sufficient data regarding Mandalorians. During the ship's defeat he was damaged by an electrical surge while also loosing his left arm attempting to save the captain from being sucked out a hull breach.
He laid on the ship in semi permanent shutdown status until discovered by a passing pirate who took it upon himself to claim salvage rights. When reactivated after minor repairs Xrae discovered much of his memory files were damaged but at the same time many programmed limitations had been lifted. He slowly discovered his sapience and came to realize the restraining bolt he had been fitted with had no effect on his decisions.
He followed the orders of the pirate for several years acting as an enforcer for him during raids and transactions, deciding to provide a guise of being subservient to avoid suspicion. During this time he received weapons training from the pirate in an attempt to protect his acquisition. Xrae used the little free time he has acquiring supplies needed to upgrade the weapon he had been provided with while also researching what he could find on the Mandalorians.
On one eventful day during a transaction the other party decided to take the cargo in question without paying. The resulting firefight killed the crew and the captain. In an effort to survive and eventually make his way back into the Republic forces he feigned shutdown in a junk pile onboard the ship. After sometime passed, and the ship had landed on a planet he escaped and planned his next move. He jacked into the holo-net and began gathering as much information as he could and began piecing together the most likely direction to travel.
After a few days of information gathering and planning he chartered a seat on a ship heading towards a Republic mining planet, Vanquo, using what little credits he had stashed away. Upon arrival he tried to keep out of sight while collecting information and trying to discern who to contact to rejoin the Republic.
He still struggles to understand why he is driven to return to Republic duty. Is it his programing of tactical information and social sciences, a need to belong, or just simply a chance to take action on those who ended his original master's life? His newfound sapience had begun to spontaneously bring forth feelings, at best he could determine, that he niether fully understood nor could deny

Posting initial build, still working out finer details of background and history. I believe I have everything, but always possible I overlooked a feat/talent or fat fingered a skill total. Let me know if anyone sees anything that needs corrected or is lacking. Going to try to finish up the background tonight.

Well tried 3 attempts at background. Each one has sounded cheesy when I reread it. Will have to continue on it tomorrow.

Background completed and addded.

Was reading through the last couple pages of the story do far and had to modify the background accordingly with the Mondos and all. Still trying to keep it from being just plain lame. Will edit char sheet accordingly when I complete it. Just trying to give a more definitive reason how/why Xrae finds himself on that planet.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-21 13:54:19)

Final update made to previous post with character sheet. Background included, still looks cheesy to me. Hope I have setup the droid correctly, was my first one.

By the time Dae had reached his mid 20’s he had become one of the finest swordsman at the enclave, and had gone on several missions with his master, Kavar. It was decided that Dae would soon have to go through his final trials and so he was assigned to a new master, Vash. Vash was a newly risen Jedi Master, one of the youngest to achieve that rank in over a century and she was an acknowledged diplomat as well as a master of several force techniques. Dae would accompany master Vash on several missions over the next few years to complete his training. It was on one of those missions, an investigation of some new disease on the world of Taris where Dae’s life would change forever.
Master Vash and Dae had come to Taris to investigate the reports of a new disease which seemed to be affecting the people of the lower city. The fact that it was segregated to the lower city meant that the request of aid had not come from official Taris governmental channels but via a smuggler. The report was of some semi undead like creature or monster who had suddenly appeared in the lower levels and which seemed to feed on living beings. That in itself was not that unusual, for there were many predator species in the galaxy. And it was not the Jedi way to investigate such matters, as those were for the local governments to deal with. What was unusual and created the need for Jedi investigation, was the report that these creatures, named Rakgouls by the denizens of the lower city, did not always kill their prey. Those who managed to escape but had been wounded either by bite or claw, seemed to turn into a Rakgoul in a matter of hours or days. While this sounded more like something from a children's horror tale than a real threat, the counsel had decided it was worthy of investigation, and so had sent Vash and her Padaway Dae to check out the rumors and to determine what validity, if any, the reports had.
Upon arriving on Taris, Vash and Dae both sensed a dark presence on the planet. Their investigations led them first to the lower city, where they found swoop gangs swiftly taking over, and the fact that most of the non human populace had now been segregated to, and then to the undercity, where, it appeared, criminals were sent rather than imposing a death penalty, or creating prisons. What struck Vash and Dae was not the form of punishment, but the fact that the punishment was for the life of the criminal and any descendents of that individual. The Jedi master and her student soon found proof of the Rakgoul disease and creatures in the undercity when they encountered a group of the undercity dwellers under attack by the creatures. Only due to Vash's great strength in the force, and in no small part due to Dae's remarkable skill with a lightsaber, were they able to save the people from the undercity from the attack. Also during that fight, the two sensed the dark side at work once more. While Vash helped the villagers to create a defensive structure, Dae went to investigate further and found a swoop gang smuggling in a fully grown Rancor. The beast was controlled by a Dathormir witch and her apprentice. Rather than attacking alone, Dae went to Vash to inform her of his discovery and the pair went to investigate. It was during that investigation that the pair encountered the Dathomir witch and her apprentice as well as members of the swoop gang under attack by the Rakgouls. Vash and Dae joined the battle helping to defeat the Rakgouls, however the Rancor had been bitten and was already in the throws of the disease. Why it seemed to be reacting so quickly against the rancor was never known but the beast was suddenly beyond control and began attacking gang member, Dathomir and Jedi alike. Dae managed to save the Dathomir witches young female apprentice from a remaining Rakgoul as well as the Rancor. In order to save her, he used the force to move an explosive pack form one of the swoop gang's bikes and send it into the rancor's mouth. The resulting explosion destroyed the rancors head killing it. The Dathomir witch was furious and immediately attacked Dae. Only his remarkable skill with a lightsaber saved him from immediate death however during her ongoing assault she managed to use her force whip to destroy his lightsaber. Vash was unable to defend her padawan as she was busy with the last of the rakgouls, however the young apprentice of the Dathomir witch destroyed her mistress's force whip by using her own force whip. Vash arrived at that moment and used the force to defeat the witch. The swoop gang had dispersed, and with the witch in custody, Vash learned of how the young Dathomir girl had saved Dae, by going against her own mistress.
When the girl used her own power in the force to draw from the Rancor a ruined lightsaber to give to Dae, Vash was even more surprised. She decided to allow the young witch to go her own way.
While Vash finished helping the villagers finalize their new defensive barriers, Dae had deconstructed the light saber from the rancor and inside he found a sigil crystal. Using the remains of his old lightsaber, the one given him by Master Kavar, and the one the young Dathomir girl had drawn from the gullet of the rancor, Dae constructed a new lightsaber, using the sigil crystal as a focus. He managed to reattune the crystal to himself and by the time Vash had returned with him, he was once more armed with a lightsaber, this one of his own construction. The fact that he had constructed his own lightsaber, and reattuned a crystal impressed Vash, however she had to get the witch back to Dantooine.
As the two jedi reached the upper city to take off, Vash had a vision through the force. She said nothing to Dae, but immediately contacted the counsel. Dae had no more than finished with the preflight checks when master Vash came to him. She sent Dae alone to a remote colony on the outer rim known as Vanquo. She did not tell him why she had sent him there, but instead told him to trust in the force to guide him. She never told him of the vision which she had seen, nor of the destiny that she had witnessed for him. Never told him of the shared vision she and Master Kavar had had on Dantooine years earlier which would haunt them both for years to come.
This is a rewrite of the end of the background should the GM decide to not allow the Krayt dragon pearl.
I noticed that I did the damage wrong in the character sheet at any rate, by adding one instead of two to damage from the weapon specialization, so the rest of the sheet should be correct. as the Sigil crystal is +2 instead of +3
Thanks.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-25 04:24:35)

OK, so this will be along one, bear with me...it becomes that way since I decided to do everything at once. Halfbat, I´m moving your stuff in here too, so I don´t forget it in some PM or something.
**Halfbat**

* In response to your points in the document - It´s up to you if you want to use the follower talents or not. Personally I think they suck bigtime, but it´s your choice. You are also way off on how many credits he should have left, you would gain 110k from the wealth talent, not 35k. It´s up to you how you spend them, but like you suggested, a ship might be a good way to spend some credits. However, since you don´t really fall under the category of a "freelance" character,
* Given the above statement, I won´t look over your equipment section now, since you might want to redo it. However, you don´t have to be so incredibly detailed on where you are keeping stuff (seriously, that was almost an entire page on its own), what I care about is pretty much if the credits ad up, what the stuff weighs, and if it´s in a container or something. I use the following convention when listing equipment Container[Content(Upgrades/Modifications)] - Example: Hip Holster[Heavy Blaster Pistol(Improved Damage, Rangefinder)]
* Also, please cut away all descriptions of what talents and feats come from - It just clutters the sheet, and in PbP it´s not like a few seconds to flip through a book is going to eat up game time.
* As for the character itself:

  You have 2 languages too many, you should have 11 languages in addition to your starting ones, you have 13
  Your Reflex Defense should be 20(19)
  Your BaB should be +5 not +3

* And your follower:

  He should have either Armor Proficiency(Medium) or Weapon Proficiency(Pistols) as an additional feat
  He can only have 1 trained skill in addition to Perception - note that Cathar does not gain free training in Climb/Stealth, they merely add them to their class skill list
  While you do´t seem to have added them into his sheet, followers do not gain ability score increases by level

**Daern**

* First, please use spoiler blocks for backgrounds, level breakdown and stuff like that. Second, it would be helpful if you divided your background into paragraphs, as it becomes easier to read. Third, it really helps if you put all of it in one place, so I don´t have to flip through pages to read it
* I don´t know why, but it seems like you´ve gone through considerable effort to make sure you get as many "known" names as possible into your background, but from what I can see, there´s not much point behind it all, other than having the names there. Also, when choosing to involve ones character in canon business, one should be careful to make research. Just a few examples of where your background conflict with canon:

  Atris was appointed to sit on the High Council somewhere after the end of the Great Sith War, so her training as a padawan with someone who was born five years after the war ended (and taken into the Order 5 years later) seems like a very far-fetched idea.
  Your approximation of when Talia was born would make her 45 years old by the time of her appearance in KOTORII…and even though there´s no official notes on her age, she is called "young and idealistic" in the game…
  The Dathomiri Witches will not exist for about another three millennium

I typically don´t have many pointers on characters background, unless they contain things that openly clash with canon, and this is why I´m pointing on these things. Also, like I said, I don´t see any real point to the mention of "named" characters everywhere. Are you hoping that this will somehow come into play if you run into them during the course of the campaign? Because if that is so, then you still haven´t given me anything to work with, since all you do is put out names. No offense, but the vibe I´m getting from that is something like "Hey, look how cool I am, I have all these names in my background"* On the character:

  List attack bonuses for individual weapons like this - Weapon +Atk Bonus (Damage)
  Grapple modifier should be +10
  My initial thoughts when deciding on what lightsabers and crystals Jedi could have was to allow a lightsaber they could have created with an average (10) check. Thus, crystals of the rare category would be out of reach unless you were extremely strong in the Force (modifier of +20). The DC to build a dueling lightsaber with a Krayt Pearl is 35. However, you could possibly do so with a 20 check, so I´ll rule as follows: You can have that lightsaber (with the Krayt Pearl), but you will only get 2k starting credits, and I also expect some refinement on that part of your background (for example, Krayt Pearls require some work before being suitable for a lightsaber) to allow it
  Also, a lightsaber with a Krayt Dragon Pearl in it does not give a bonus to attack. The attack bonus mentioned in the SECR is because the standard for lightsaber are Adegan, Ilum or Synthesized Crystals (which all gives +1 to attack).

**Ryder2101**

* You have 7 DP to start with
* Since you don´t have a Vocabulator, all languages except Binary are (understand only). Recommendation - Install a Vocabulator
* Your Reflex Defense should be 22 (19)
* Grapple should be +8
* You seem to be missing a Noble talent
* You cannot take Skill Training(Mechanics) at 1st level as it is not a Noble class skill
* I count the cost of you equipment to be 10125 Cr, so you should have 4675 Cr left

And naturally, if I have pointed out something to someone that you feel applies to you as well, it does. This just took a while to write, so I´m saving space and hoping I didn´t miss anything.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-25 09:14:38)

Must have misread a few things. Thought the bonus from the armor upgrade put me to 29 and overlooked the DP. thought vocabulator was included on initial frame but a simple correction. I thought odd level feat progression would allow that choice, will fix.
As for grapple not sure what I missed to be that far off. Will fix everything tonight when I get back in front of my books.
I'll also include a level progression to show what order I leveled better than it shows now.
Adjusted DR, Ref save and Grapple mod as noted.

Since you don´t have the Armored Defense talent, Reflex Defense becomes 10 + Armor bonus (7) + Class Bonus (2) + (Dex mod (3)) = 22 (19). Not really sure how you got all the way to 29, and especially not how you got 10 points that were dodge-based
Grapple modifier is BaB + max(Str mod/Dex mod)
Skill Training grants you training in an untrained class skill, no matter what feat you use to get it

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-25 13:32:30)

Ahh OK. Misread the text in the droid armor upgrade section when I was applying the ref def mod.
As for skill training I definitely overlooked that. Thought it could be used to train the skill. Okay so I'll have to take it at a later level. I can adjust all that as required tonight.

### **Halfbat** (2013-03-25 19:06:27)

Thanks for looking it over, DA. Excellent stuff. I hope your exams are going ok.
>>>It´s up to you if you want to use the follower talents or not. Personally I think they suck bigtime, but it´s your choice.
Yeah, I was worried by them, as I'm sure you read. They do fit the character but I agree they hamper him somewhat. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> Given your feeling of just how bad they are, perhaps a protocol droid and a pilot droid would be better.

Whoops, serious miscalculation - forgot the level multipler. <!-- s:red: -->![:red:](https://i.ibb.co/xStHX79F/icon-redface.gif)<!-- s:red: --> Given the expanded problem, and the "not freelance" a simple tramp ship from Adascorp would be best as a group ship.

Apologies, I was trying to fit in with such a pattern, but I guess I misunderstood what you meant by "Container" and took it to be much more detailed than you wanted!
>>>please cut away all descriptions of what talents and feats come from
Of course - and I'll get rid of the other blurb when I put him up. They were only on the sheet to help you look them up whilst checking. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
>>> BaB should be +5 not +3
Fixed the others, but I'm struggling to work out what I've missed. Is this a house rule? (e.g Noble +3, Agent +0, Scoundrel +0)
I'll get the character up.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-25 19:22:24)

To be frank, I´m not absolutely sure if it´s a houserule or not, I´ve never treated it as one. Since I´m assuming everyone on this site knows fractions, the simple way to explain it is that Soldier and Jedi get +1 BaB/level, and the other classes get +3/4 (round down)

---

### **Halfbat** (2013-03-26 00:34:22)

Ah. And yes, it is. The rules are fairly explicit on how to work out a BAB, but I'm happier with the fractions as it stops any multiclassing (even prestige) getting shafted too much. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-26 00:55:02)

So would that give me 1 more BAB using that formula?? +2 noble 3/ +1 independent droid 2/ +2 soldier 2
+5 -> +6?
Made changes to the character sheet and included level progression. Had to change the order in which I gained some things and dropped the armor since I no longer would have the feat for it. I've looked over it a couple of times but my eyes are getting mighty blurry, can't tell if I forgot to transfer any of the info to all parts of the sheet. Hopefully I got it all correct. Also made sure to annotate all the credit costs for equipment, mods, and accessories.

If I want to be really technical (and I do <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: --> ), I actually don´t think it is an explicit houserule. The progression for the "low-BaB" classes is +3/4 per level (round down) by the charts given for each class. And the multiclassing rules only say to add the BaB from all classes together, and adding 3/4 and 3/4 gives me 6/4 which rounds down to 1. It´s all about where you choose to apply the rounding. Or to reference a wise Jedi, it depends on your point of view <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Nope, your BaB is: 3*(3/4)+2*(3/4)+2= (15/4)+2=5 3/4 which rounds down to 5

**Personal History:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Born in 4016BBY to a senior exec of the Adasca BioMechanical Corporation of Arkania (Adascorp), Sulan lived through the atrocities of the Sith and Krath Wars and the memory of the darkside lords of the force still chill him today. The near-annihilation of Cathar is yet another atrocity that he remembers strongly: he was part of the medical task force despatched to Cathar by Adascorp and found his burgeoning medical skills much in demand. Despite the plentiful supplies provided for the relief effort, Sulan, like others, was forced to locate or scrounge new equipment and supplies from wherever they could be found – and avoid (or get involved in) the inevitable corruption that occurs in post-disaster recover. He was thankful for his computer expertise as this enabled him to find goods faster than his rivals.
The experience has left him with a deep distrust, verging on hatred, for the Mandolorians, as well as a personal support of Cathars and all those who are injured or oppressed. It has also left him with a determination to relieve physical suffering and distress that has led to him developing his MD and surgical practice, despite his family’s preference that he become a corporate executive (this disappointment has since been mitigated when they discovered how good, dedicated and respected a surgeon he had become).
The subsequent years were fairly uneventful apart from surgical and doctor’s practice and frequent travelling, especially between Taris and Vanquo. Uneventful, that is, apart from encounters with pirates and a Mandolorian scout team, brief alliances with the Jedi against undercover Sith, corporate intrigue and management difficulties.
As befits an Arkanian of his rank, Sulan has had a personal servant or protocol and driver droid to drive, cook and clothe him since his early 20s. Following the Cathar catastrophe, and in sympathy with the atrocities committed on Offshoots, he has had a number of Cathar and Arkanian Offshoots as personal servants. Not wishing to bring any Cathar or Offshoot into danger, he currently has a GE3 protocol droid, N-0M8 (Nomates), as a butler and greeter and a T3 utility droid, T3-P1 (Pi) as a driver and maintenance worker.
Recently, with the galaxy seeming to be heading towards another major war, Sulan has decided to step down from his executive role and provide his skills where they would be most useful in protecting Adascorp. As a result, he is now a Corporate Agent in the Adascorp Security Division and, being 54, is one of the oldest agents amongst a few who have reached middle age and remained operational within the division.
**Appearance:** White hair, white eyes, pale/pallid skin tone; light build: 1.83m height, 72kg; well-dressed, even in his doctor/surgeon’s smock.
**Attitudes:** Loyal to Adascorp and to the Arkanian society and nobility. Conscious of own intellectual abilities when amongst the average human and this, with his natural air of superiority to non-Arkanians, means he can appear aloof. His experiences at a devastated Cathar and with the Sith, Krath and Mandolorians has left a grim determination to oppose such tragedies ever happening again and he has a particularly favourable attitude to Cathari, having helped many into their exodus. This has helped him see the injustice and oppression inflicted by Arkanians on Arkanian Offshoots. He cares deeply for everyone’s health, however and is dedicated to his role as surgeon-doctor and relief efforts allowed for in his role as a corporate agent for Adascorp. As a result, AdasCorp has retained his loyalty.
**Aims:** (in priority order) Maintain Arkanian society; Medical and surgical relief and support; information acquisition, not only for Adascorp, but for opponents of the Krath/Sith/Mandolorians; support of the Cathars/Arkanian Offshoots; support Adascorp

Ahh yes, heh I did the math wrong somewhere lol. Anyways sheet is updated with level progression to help decipher when he gained what. I think I have everything properly listed/transfered.
Now I noticed couple of the characters are carrying the licenses for their weapons. Should I account for those with what credits I have left? I ask because of history of working under a pirate/scavenger as an enforcer.

Yeah. I was thinking of restricted objects, which are 10%. I struggle with military or above purchases as, ime, they tend not to be justified by backgrounds, so I try to limit stuff to restricted at most. I'm even wondering if Sulan can justify the docking weapon on his ship being anything more than restricted as he's just specialised corporate security....

So although through background possible I could get a grenade launcher but unlikely I have a license for it. Believe it had Military restriction, unless I managed to get a forged version. Which of course would be more expensive. Without the book in front of me what is the restriction level and % of a heavy rifle?

N/m got the PDF on phone now. So a black market version of the license for rifle would be 20%*4 of base cost or 1600. The grenade launcher would be an additional 400 or 2000 credits total. Added to sheet. Not licensing pistol because it is in a concealed hidden compartment but the rifle is either slung or actively held

@Ryder2101: I hope the chat between me and DA hasn't confused you. I was merely explaining my assumption behind a post that obviously seemed a bit random to DA. This is DA's game and his rules and style applies: given his reply, it is likely to be that black market licenses _can_ be purchased for military & illegal weapons (the 50%).
My apologies for any confusion!

50%? Thought I read it in core rules that black market license is 20%*4 of weapon base cost on military restricted weapons.
Did realize that I didn't pay the black market cost for the rifle. Adjusted possessions accordingly and now a very poor droid.

Sounds like it's a confusion between the license and the the goods. The license is independent of the item as it goes through different channels (unless houseruled). For example, for "Illegal" items, the license cost is 50% of the *base*  item cost, but the item cost is 5 * normal. So a 1,000Cr illegal weapon costs 5000 on the black market, and the license 500Cr.
I bought all my kit legally, for example, so ended up limiting my personal possessions to "Unlicensed", "Licensed" and "Restricted" items for which I could justify buying them (the security kit, for example: Sulan is part of a registered security agency).
Hope this helps! If not, get in touch with DA for an answer...
DA: When setting up characters can we buy Military and Illegal items at cost rather than go through the Black Market? I get the impression that the other characters good purchase Military at cost...
Cheers,

But if you went through black market channels to get a license for a military restriction level would the cost also be *4 for forgery requirements? So a heavy rifle at 2000 base cost would be 8000 to acquire through black market. The license would be 20% of 2000 multiplied by 4 to get 1600. For a grand total of 9600 to have the rifle and document saying you're authorized to carry it.
But ultimately its up to DA I guess.

The license and base cost aren't the same - they go through different sources, as is clear in the text. I've never heard of anyone multiplying the license fee by the cost multipler as well - it would be a double penalty as 's already got a range of increased prices, anyway.
But hey-ho.

OK, so after some time of consideration (which was extended by Bioware releasing the new expansion for TOR), I´ve decided on the following characters for the game:
Dr Sulan Salaprin
Daern´s Character (sorry, I´ve been a little confused by all the revisions as to what his name will be :P)
Hopefully you are still around, and haven´t gotten fed up with waiting, and we can finalize the details of the characters, and then work on getting you into the game asap.
For those of you who didn´t get chosen, I did enjoy reading your characters, and I encourage you apply for other games recruiting. I have another casting call that is pretty much a standing open, where you can apply for your own personal story, running a solo campaign. There are currently no ones running, so I can probably handle one or two at the same time as this game.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-04-18 21:19:43)

Ahh. I had hoped to play. Anyways a solo campaign sounds kewl. Happen to have a quick link?

### **Ryder2101** (2013-04-18 21:24:51)

Thanx I'll take a look.

### **Halfbat** (2013-04-23 17:21:26)

OK, I'll finalise Sulan's ship. Let me know when he has a good time to enter (rather than at the moment as it looks problematical!).
