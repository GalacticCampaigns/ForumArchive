I was wondering if the CG community would be interested in a friendly game of Star Wars Mafia. The link above has the basic rules
These are the roles that will be assigned to players. I'm thinking the Day period would last a week real time and the Night period will last 2 days.
This would allow some our less frequent players to have plenty of opportunity to post and play
**Imperials**
All Imperials are Town players. They win when all Rebel players and Fringers third-party players are dead. Unless otherwise noted, they do not know the identity of any other players when the game begins.
Imperial Citizen
These are your average, everyday players. They have no special abilities. In most games, Imperials will be the most common roles.
ISB Agent
Once per Night, ISB Agents can Investigate another player. They will receive a result of "innocent", if the player is not a Rebel member, or "guilty", if the player is Rebel. Their result may also be changed by the powers of their target (Rebel Cell Leader, Framer, Sympathetic Imperial Senator).
Insane ISB Agent
The Insane Cop acts as a ISB Agent, but always gets the opposite result of what they would normally get. They think they are a normal ISB Agent, and are revealed as a normal ISB Agent on death.
Paranoid ISB Agent
As Insane ISB Agent, but always gets "guilty" results.
Naive ISB Agent
As Insane ISB Agent, but always gets "innocent" results.
Imperial Informer
Once per Night, the Informer can watch another player. They will learn the identity of any player who performs any action on their target, with the exception of the Informer. Rebel meetings do not count as visits.
Scout Trooper
Once per Night, the Scout Trooper can track a player. They will learn the identity of any player whom their target visits. Rebel meetings do not count as visits.
2-1B surgical droid
Once per Night, the 2-1B surgical droid can do medicine to another player. That player will not die if shot by the Rebel, Serial Killer, or other killing role that Night.
Death Stick Addict
Once per Night, the town Death Stick Addict can choose to go partying with another player. That player will get smashed out of their skull, unable to perform any Night actions.
Imperial Guard
Once per Night, the Imperial Guard can choose to escort another player. If that player is targeted by a killing role, there is a 50% chance that the Imperial Guard will die in that player's place, and a 50% chance that the Imperial Guard will kill the killer instead.
Emperor's Hand
Once per Night, the Emperor's Hand can target another player for Nightkill.
Imperil Assassin
The Imperial Assassin can, once per game, publicly declare "Daykill: Player", and kill the named player.
Imperial Mortician
The Mortician can check the identity of one Janitored player (see Janitor, below) per Night.
Rebel Sympathizer
The Rebel Sympathizer thinks he is a normal Imperial, but appears "guilty" to ISB Agent, and will be revealed as as Rebel upon death.
Storm Trooper
The Storm Trooper has been issued armor. He will not die the first time that he is shot at Night.
Brainwashed Imperial
If the Brainwashed Imperial is targeted for Nightkill, he will explode, killing both himself and the person who targeted him. If he was targeted by the Rebels, he will kill a random Rebel member.
Paranoid Imperial Citizen
Will shoot anyone who visits him at Night for any reason.
Vengeful Imperial
When lynched, the Vengeful Imperial has the option to declare a Daykill.
Dark Side Prophet
Can declare one other person to be the target of his or her Dark Side Prophet powers at Night. If the Dark Side Prophet is killed that Night or the following Day for any reason, the Oracled person will have his or her role revealed.
Imperial Pilot
Can switch two people at Night. Anything that targets one of those players will happen to the other instead.
Imperial Intelligence Agent
Can do psychology to one other person per Night. If that person is targeted by a recruiting role, such as the Dark Side Disciple, the recruit attempt will fail.
**Rebels**
Rebel players know the identity of all other Rebel members, can talk at Night, and can group-Nightkill. Then win when all Imperial and Fringer third-party players are dead.
Rebel Agent
The basic Rebel role, the Rebel Agent has no special powers.
Jedi
Once per Night, the Jedi can declare a player to target with his Jedi Mind Trick. That player will be so distracted that they will not be able to perform any Night actions, and won't remember the Jedi's identity when they wake up, either.
Rebel Cell Leader
The Rebel Cell Leader appears innocent to Cops.
Rebel Cleaner
Once per game (or more, depending on the setup), the Rebel Cleaner can hide the body of the Rebel's group-Nightkill target, preventing the other players from learning his or her role. Only the Rebel Cleaner will know what the target was. The rest of the Rebels must wait until the Rebel Cleaner gets a chance to tell them.
Rebel Framer
Can choose one person every Night to frame, making them appear "guilty" to ISB Agent.
Sympathetic Imperial Senator
Can choose one Rebel member every Night, making that player appear "innocent" to ISB Agent.
Jedi Sentinel
Can choose one person per Night to silence. The silenced person may not speak during the next Day, though they may vote.
Rebel Recon Agent
Can follow one person per Night, learning that player's role.
Rebel Spy
Can lurk outside the bushes of someone's house. The first person to visit the chosen person's house will be killed.
Force Adept
Once per Night, can place a curse on someone. If that player is visited during the Night, they will die.
Rebel Pilot
Can switch two people at Night. Anything that targets one of those players will happen to the other instead.
**Fringers**
Third-Party players are "officially" aligned with neither the Imperials nor the rebels. They may have win conditions that make them "unofficial" allies, though, like the Traitor. They win when their win conditions are fulfilled, and, unless otherwise noted, don't know the identities of any other player.
**Dark Side Disciple**
Once per Night, the Dark Side Disciple (who is otherwise a normal Dark Side Devotee) can recruit someone into the cult. That person becomes a Dark Side Devotee. If the Dark Side Disciple dies, the rest of the Devotees do, too. The Dark Side Devotees win when they outnumber the other players. Devotees can communicate privately at any time, but have no powers other than their ability to recruit.
**Bounty Hunter**
Wants to lynch someone. He wins if that person is lynched. Not if they die any other way, though.
**Dark Side Maurader**
Kills one person every Night. Wins if he is the last one standing.
**Moisture Farmer**
Wants to live. He wins if he doesn't die.
**Clawdite Shifter**
Once per game, the Clawdite Shifter can choose a dead person to become. He gains their role, including powers and win conditions.
**Imperial Traitor**
Wants the Rebels to win. Is otherwise powerless

Sounds interesting. I remember seeing the discussion about this in the chat.
As an add on, I'd like to mention it would be easy to make private forums for this using the groups function to declare who has permission to see it. Each group with a private forum would have a group leader who would invite or remove members from the group as needed.

That would be great cause the mafia really need a place to discuss things that no one else can go read or find out who is posting. They could always use PMs

The advantage too is they would be able to use the poll functions provided by the forum. Each night could be in a new thread with a new poll, or use the same thread and just restart it, but I think the former may work better.
A downside to using PMs is if someone forgets to reply to all, then someone may be missing out on a bit of conversation.
The game moderator would probably be the best candidate to be group leader, this way he could make sure rule observances are kept.

Really too bad. Seems like it would be a lot of fun and seems easy enough to pick up. Doesn't even need character development or anything. Just people to play.
