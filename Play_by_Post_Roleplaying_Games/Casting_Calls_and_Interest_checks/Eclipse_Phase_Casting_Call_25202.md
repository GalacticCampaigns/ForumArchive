# Eclipse Phase Casting Call

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-08 12:25:18)

*An “eclipse phase” is the period of time between when a cell is infected by a virus and when the virus appears within the cell and transforms it. During this period, the cell does not appear to be infected, but it is.*
Even though technology has advanced to the point where health problems like cancer or heart disease is all but extinct, that does not mean that everything is fine. Mankind may have survived the apocalypse and established itself in space, ascending into "transhumanity", but many threats still exists, particularly the internal ones. Strife between factions exists just like they did before the Fall, and some factions even managed to escape earth, still living on. Alien technology and lifeforms, strange biotechnological virus strands, and the ever possible return of the TITAN AIs that destroyed earth are present as well, external threats which we still have little information on.
Luckily, there are those that attempts to keep track of these threats, and these people are always in need of volunteers to perform services for them, because even if forking can certainly help them multi-task, it only goes so far. One such person is professor Magnus Ming of the Titan Autonomous University, and as such he has summoned a number of capable individuals from various parts of the Galaxy to enlist their aid.
=========================================================================
OK, so that´s for the in-game introduction. I´m looking for about 4-6 people to play this, though it could be adjusted for fewer/more as well. The system used is called *Eclipse Phase*, and the rulebook can be found [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?5y21jnmwmqt "http://www.mediafire.com/?5y21jnmwmqt"). It is a percentage-based system and the setting is a post-apocalyptic (at least in one sense) version of our own Galaxy, into a not-to-distant future. For those familiar with those systems, I´d call it a hybrid between *Call of Chtullu* and *Shadowrun*.
**Character Build Guidelines**

* 1000 CP will be used, and follow the process outlined in the book. If there are any questions, just raise them here.
* I´m not requiring you to become experts on the lore of the setting, but I´d like backgrounds longer than three sentences.
* If you want to use one of the premade characters from the book, that is OK (I am assuming they are correctly made), but I would rather have you make your own characters.
* In a setting where bodies can be designed in pretty many ways, a section on appearance isn´t optional, it´s mandatory.
* Remember to keep track of the details of your character (ammo, lost health/sanity, conditions suffered, etc). Even if you don´t, I will.
* For simplicity, I´ll say that none of your character have had any prior involvement with the organization known as Firewall. Thus I encourage you not to put any points in i-rep or Networking:Firewall. This will change a few things in the starter adventure I´ll be using, but not overly so, and I have no doubt you´ll be able to handle things anyway.
* If you want to use the optional rules of combined/brand name arms on pg 336, consult with me first.
* List your morph bonus to an aptitude as a clear addition to your base aptitude. *Example: You have SOM 15, COO 20 and a +5 SOM bonus from your morph. This is listed as SOM: 15+5, COO: 20*
* List your morph bonus to a skill as a clear addition to your base skill. *Example: You have SOM 15, a +5 SOM bonus from your morph, and have spent 30 points on your Freerunning skill. This is listed as Freerunning: 45+5*
* Please include a summary of what your CP have been spent on somewhere in your post.

I didn't think of it like that but you're right. I'm **definitely** in though I can't say exactly what my build will be - there's just so many options!

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-08 13:18:49)

just out of curiosity, how did you think about it?

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-08 13:51:29)

I wasn't thinking about it as post-apocalyptic really. I think with so much emphasis on Transhumanity, and the departure from Earth, it seems more like a diaspora or exodus or escape or evolutionary leap or something. I hadn't really been picturing it from the perspective of Earthlings but more of from Sol-lings (members of our solar system). There are people, after all, that were born pre-Fall on the moon and other places - I wonder if they would still consider it "post-apocalypse"? It's definitely a percentile system though, I just hate quoting half-sentences.
As far as a build goes, my initial thoughts are: I'm most like going to go ahead and commit my usual mistake by making someone that doesn't focus *primarily* on combat, though clearly it's suicidal to go in unarmed and that's not at all my intention. I'll probably run with a Scumborn that makes/sells vids of his life (which, luckily, seems to be about to get far more interesting) and makes major decisions (sleeves, journeys, tactics, etc.) based on polling his followers. I imagine it's like a combination of Survivor, American Idol, and Choose Your Own Adventure all wrapped up in a mini-series. Heavy on creative solutions delivered with flair rather than predictable (and probably safer) patterns of behavior. I'm not entirely sure of the specifics but he's likely going to have a tricked out pistol and some light armor, maybe with a vacuum-sealable biomorph and oxygen reserves just for fun. Ordinarily bored and somewhat arrogant, he quickly becomes focused and most in his element when filming the "action sequences". Definitely not a "frontline" but a solid backup in most circumstances, with high rep/networking in the @-list.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-08 14:29:10)

It is not the same setting that we usually associate with the term "post-apocalyptic", such as seen in movies like *The Road*, *Reign of Fire*, *Resident Evil:Afterlife* or in books like *The Genesis of Shannara Triology*. In those settings pretty much all infrastructure and communications is destroyed, people live in isolated communities or simply on the road, and resources are few. But here we have functioning societies, governments and factions, just like we have on earth now.
However, with the singularity and the resulting Fall only a decade past, memory should still linger on with many people, especially those living in affected places (Earth, Luna, Mars). Also, the aftermath should be pretty heavily felt, such as the restrictions on AI, the fear of the mysterious exsurgent virus, and so on. This is why I referred to it as being post-apocalyptic in one sense, and this is also how the game refers to itself, in addition to the themes of horror and conspiracy.
Sounds like an interesting concept, and in no way should you feel compelled to make characters who focus heavily on combat. It doesn´t take much to be competent in combat in this game, and you should have plenty of resources to spend on other things as well. Take it from me, having 70+ in a weapons skill don´t mean you hit all that often, and in rare occasions you don´t hit anything, or when you do, your GM has picked out some weird crap from the Chtullu mythos that is immune to your firearm, which forces you to try and use that alien weapon you found, that you only have 33 skill in, and only one shot...
Yeah, my *Call of Chtullu* GM could be a sadist when he wanted to...

Well said. And I've never played CoC (and don't much imagine I will) but I've read some interesting reviews and comments about it. Coupled with the artwork from the mythos I've seen - I think a 33 skill with a one-shot alien weapon is being generous. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
I still haven't explored all the options yet and I feel like a generally positive - and sane - character would be out of place in EP, so I'm sure he'll end up with some sort of ominous bad habit. Maybe he calls his pistol his paintbrush or something. I'm sure he's being heavily influenced by Adam Jensen (beat DE:HR last week) and Thrawn (I'm on chapter 7 of book 3 now) and, well, me (I have an art degree). Do we have a thread to rant about the ending of DE yet? Because we should.

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-09 21:11:07)

If I was to say "**Hey DA - can I take the *Edited Memories* trait and leave the details entirely up to you?**" would you be cool with that? I keep toying with the idea of playing an Infugee (Re-Instantiated background) but I'm not settled just yet. Locus is totally awesome though, and I'm definitely weaving that into the character.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-10 01:03:09)

Maybe, but I´d just like to point ou that if you get it as part of your background, it´s not so much that you are *taking* the trait as you are *getting* it. That is, you don´t earn any extra CP from it.

(This is as far as I got. Will make character discription and background as soon as possible. Wanted to get the meat and potatoes fleshed out before I post that bit of info. It was harder than I thought to make a character, lost of flipping back and forth to find what I needed. Just need to get used to it though Im sure. Let me know if anything seems amiss. I triple checked my point allocations and went by the book.....so heres hoping for no errors.)

Understood. I started with the description/background story and will have the build up at some point in the next couple days. If I recall correctly, and haven't changed it, it begins: "*Jokin Okin* [yeah, I'm re-using the name for now, maybe it'll change before I post] *was born among the teeming mass of life and geodesic steel that is Locus.*"

OK Rowen, here is what I could find on your character, which also explains why I though him to be so...thin <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

* I sum the total CP cost up to only 890 CP, which means you have some more to spend
* I count only 355 CP spent on Active skills, you must spend 400
* Also, you have 2 specializations for Hardware[Electronics], you can only have 1
* In the the stats row, you have listed DUR twice, one should be DR (Death Rating), and your DB should be 2
* I count the cost of your stuff to be 800 total, which should give you 1700 Cr left
* How did you get your g-rep to 55? You get 50 points to start with, and 1 CP buys you 10 rep points…

Also, here are some guidelines for how to present certain things, I think I will add these lines to the original post as well:

* List your morph bonus to an aptitude as a clear addition to your base aptitude. *Example: You have SOM 15, COO 20 and a +5 SOM bonus from your morph. This is listed as SOM: 15+5, COO: 20*
* List your morph bonus to a skill as a clear addition to your base skill. *Example: You have SOM 15, a +5 SOM bonus from your morph, and have spent 30 points on your Freerunning skill. This is listed as Freerunning: 45+5*
* Please include a summary of what your CP have been spent on somewhere in your post.

Dang I was hoping I hadn't messed up that bad, in my defense it was 3am lol. I will correct these as soon as possible on my next days off. Oh okay, to have more than on specilization in the same filed you have to take that field as another skill (That sound right)?
For the equipment I found it hard to even find tables for it, much less costs. I used a table that based the amount on weither the time was (low, moderate or high) the breadcrumb positioning system was moderate and 1000 credits. If you found an easier table let me know cause I must have over looked it.
With the rep, again 3am....lol. I was trying to find how your rep started and seemed to think it was the same as your networking skill, just carried over.
Anyway, thats why I put it up early.....I always mess up character sheets cause I over look something.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-10 16:44:09)

Yes, if you had two separate field skills, you could have a specialization for each of them. Still, your choices there are a bit odd. You have selected Implants as a specialization, but Implants are shown to be a separate field of the Hardware skill (pg 179). Also, I´m not going to let you take **Electronics** as a specialization of the Hardware[**Electronics**] skill...specializations are supposed to represent extra ability in a certain area of a skill. So from what I can tell, you should be good by just taking Hardware[Electronics] and Hardware[Implants], with no specializations.
Pages 137 and 296 have tables for equipment costs (same table, different places), you can use the average values for starting equipment. I´m not sure which BPS you were looking at, because the one I found on pg 332 has a Low cost, which averages to 250.
For rep, you get 50 points to start with that you can spend on the various social networks, and you can buy more at the cost of 1 CP for 10 rep points. Rep is different from your Networking skills, and to see how they interact, look at the section starting at pg 285. Basically rep is your actual standing within a certain network, and Networking skills are how good you are at using your contacts in the network. Both of them can work on their own to help you interact with various factions, but they function best together.
Oh, and I forgot to mention last time, you don´t have a native tongue listed. Remember that you get that skill for free at the level of INT+70. Just add it in as any other language skill and put "Native" in front of it.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-10 17:08:30)

It may be worth mentioning that the Native Language is the only starting skill allowed over 80 - the examples have it higher. Makes sense, since most aptitudes are going to start at 15 unless you really skew a build, and you get a +70 to it. I'm not trying to point out the obvious here, but the math did confuse me until I looked at the sample characters again.
I *thought* I knew what I wanted for a character... the more I read the more I want to go in different directions. ~~An Async in a swarmanoid morph might be interesting~~*... <!-- s8/ -->![8/](https://i.ibb.co/kVxpy8vX/icon-eek.gif)<!-- s8/ -->
*Edit: Not possible, my bad - Asyncs need a biomorph or pod. No worries.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-10 18:40:50)

Well, if you´re having trouble deciding, let me kill that idea for you right away. An async in any form of synthmorph cannot access any of his psi abilities, so all you´d be giving yourself is a lot of drawbacks and CP expenditure.

"**Yes, I've heard all the horror stories about what Transhumanity faces. Whatever. They lack the vivid imagination to comprehend the terrors I was born into - the terrors I was meant to be. How could I possibly expect them to understand me? So of course they hate me: fearing the unknown is what they do best. And it's not like I have nowhere else to go, you know. I'm making my own universe in my head. Well, not exactly in my *head*. Sometimes people ask if they can come watch me and I tell them I don't mind at all… but they never stay long. I don't understand. I mean, wouldn't you want to spend a few days in a lush island paradise, surrounded by hundreds of children that need parents? You can be their mom or their dad or whatever. They don't say anything really, they just play that game.
[chuckles]
I showed them how to change their faces and now whenever someone looks at them they switch to that person's face. It's *really* cute - you should come see it sometime. But that's not going to stop the monsters, you know? They need someone to protect them from the monsters in the water.
[stares at the floor]
*Them*. Yeah, I made them too. I don't know why… it just seemed right I guess. All those rich browns and deep greens and sparkling blues, I just needed to throw some black paint in there too, you know? No, you don't. Nevermind. Anyway. The monsters only come out at night and the children need someone to fight for them - they're just kids really.
[getting agitated]
Look, I know you can't understand what I'm telling you and believe me when I say that whatever notes you're taking are so far off-base it'll take you a decade to realize it but they're *real* - as real as you or me - and I watch out for *all* of them. That's a good thing, okay, I'm a *good person*.
[stands, shouting and pacing]
But you? None of you can even figure out how to make it on one little planet so now you're screwing up the solar system but I made a whole *universe* of island planets ready to be wiped out any minute by an evil that transcends your ability to articulate and I do it all in my head *every day*. The Lost - that's what you call us. Does that sound like someone who doesn't know where they are to you - a person that makes galaxies with his *mind* because it's the only place you people can't get to? That's not lost, that's *transhuman*. We *are* Transhumanity. Maybe, if you're nice enough, I'll let you come stay in my universe when you trash yours. I'll even give you a nice boat.
[sits back down, stares at the floor again]
That's why I don't usually bother with the real world. It's a big galaxy, you know? It's not like I'm asking for friends or something awful like that - I have them. They're in my head. Well, not exactly in my *head*. Look, it's going to be night soon - can I go now please?**"

Vincent is somewhat of a recluse, content to spend every waking moment in a vast VR universe of his own making. He currently resides in a small living quarters on Locus. He finds the freedom that is encouraged there, and the opportunity to "live and let live" with his neighbors, is preferable to living just about anywhere else in the system. On those rare (and awkward) occasions where he must venture out for any reason, Vincent trades minor but innovative VR games or XP recordings for whatever supplies he may need. His original creations have lead to his increased following among enthusiasts but few can stomach his private simulation for long - hundreds of planets full of tropical islands inhabited by shape-changing children who are regularly attacked by disturbingly evil creatures from the deep takes some getting used to.
Being one of the "Lost" - a living result of the failed Futura Project - has naturally affected Vincent in ways that don't always seem apparent at first. He can be moody or withdrawn, and is easily agitated when things begin to heat up, but aside from his addiction (he would call it his "routine") to Mono No Aware which he imbibes at least once daily and his Futura biomorph there's little to indicate his terrible past. Some Lost, the lucky ones, are able to eventually supress the memories that Vincent remembers vividly and in crisp detail. Psychosurgery is simply not an option since the risk of losing his creativity - the only thing he has that keeps him reasonably sane - would be too great.
Vincent has a very eclectic collection of knowledge and it serves him well. He isn't interested in a lot of the "trivia" ordinary people might find significant and yet some things - like ancient Roman architecture or how an automatic rifle works - are of critical importance to him. In almost all cases it's a matter of what he needs to complete a component of his VR program and once it's mastered he lets his creative instincts take over until the task is done. He may never re-visit the subject again unless absolutely necessary.
The Futura morphs are superb examples of design and engineering but easily spotted in a crowd, hence the stigma that comes with being involved with the project. Nevertheless, Vincent allows the biomorph to retain it's original appearance with few, if any, changes. He dresses simply and with function in his smart vac suit, usually taking the shape of a tunic and pants in earthtones or sterile white. What flesh does show (mostly the neck up) is attractive in its own right, skin and eyes stained pale blue from the MNA addiction.

Ambience Sense (passive, self, automatic, constant): This sleight provides the async with an instinctive sense about an area and any potential threats nearby. The async receives a +10 modi er to all Investigation, Perception, Scrounging, and Surprise Tests.
Eidectic Memory (The character can remember everything that ever happened to them, in detail, with no long term memory loss. For example, they can recite a page they read in a book a month ago, recall a string of 200 random characters they viewed a year ago, or even tell you what they had for breakfast on a particular date a decade ago. However, they can only remember things they paid attention to. The character will not remember the contents of a note on someone’s desk if they merely glanced at it; they must speci cally have read it. No effort is required to use this augmentation, the character merely needs to attempt to remember a specific fact.)
Emotional Dampers (This low-cost alternative to endocrine control (p. 304) allows the user to voluntarily damp their morph’s emotional responses and various non-verbal cues like pupil dilation, eye movement, or vocal tone. Using this augmentation allows the user to lie and conceal their emotions in such as way as oo fool the keenest observer; apply a +30 modifier to Deception and Impersonation Tests. This modi cation does not affect methods of detecting lies and emotions that involve reading the character’s neural state, including psi-gamma sleights. However, this augmentation damps out all emotional responses and so causes the character to be less persuasive in real- time personal interactions, imposing a –10 modi er to other Social skill tests like Persuasion. Characters can turn this augmentation on or off at will.
Enhanced Creativity (passive, self, automatic, constant): An async with Enhanced Creativity is more imaginative and more inclined to think outside the box. Apply a +20 modifier to any tests where creativity plays a major role. This level of ingenuity can sometimes seem strange and different, manifesting in odd or creepy ways, especially with artwork.
Enhanced Vision (low/250): The morph’s eyes have tetrachromatic vision capable of exceptional color differentiation. These eyes can also see the electromagnetic spectrum from terahertz wave frequencies to gamma rays, enabling them to see a total of several dozen colors, instead of the seven ordinary human eyes can perceive. In addition, these eyes have a variable focus equivalent to 5 power magni ers or binoculars. This augmentation provides a +20 modifier to all Perception Tests involving vision. For further applications, see Using Enhances Senses, p. 302
Hyperthymesia (passive, self, automatic, constant): Hyperthymesia grants the async a superior autobiographical memory, allowing them to remember the most trivial of events. A hyperthymestic async can be asked a random date and recall the day of the week it was, the events that occurred that day, what the weather was like, and many seemingly trivial details that most people would not be able to recall.
Mnemonic Augmentation (low/250): A character with this augmentation and a cortical stack can access digital recordings of all of the sensory data they have experienced in XP format (and they may share these recordings with others). Mnemonic augmentation differs from the eidetic memory bioware because it allows characters to digitally share all of their sensory data with others. It also allows them to closely examine sensory data they did not initially look at. For example, If the character glanced at a note but did not read it, they can later use image enhancement software to enhance this image and in most cases actually read what the note said. Mnemonic augmentation allows the character to clearly hear all background noises, like a conversation at a nearby table that the character only initially heard a few words of. Using mnemonic augmentation to retrieve a speci c piece of information is quite easy, but usually requires between 2 and 20 minutes of concentration.
Mono No Aware: Taken from the Japanese term for sadness at the ephemerality of worldly things, this drug, typically ingested as a tea, is a depressant that induces a meditative state. Mono No Aware gives the character a +10 bonus on Art and Sense Tests. With frequent use, Mono No Aware reacts with pigments in the skin to create a pallor with a slight bluish tinge, even in darker-skinned morphs. [Low]
Multitasking (passive, self, automatic, constant): The async can handle vast amounts of information without overload and can perform more than one mental task at once. The character receives an extra Complex Action each Action Phase that may only be used for mental or mesh actions.
Oracles (moderate/1000):These neural macrosensing nanobots pay attention to the sensory input on which the character is not focusing, alerting them about important things they might otherwise overlook. Oracles also act as a sort of memory buffer and search aid, extending short term memory, helping the character recall memories and details, and crosschecking them with other memories. Oracles negate Perception modifiers for distraction, apply a +10 modi-  er to Investigation Tests, and add a +30 bonus to memory-related tests.
Pattern Recognition (passive, self, automatic, constant): The character is adept at spotting patterns and correlating the non-random elements of a jumble—related items jump out at them. This is useful for translating languages, breaking codes, or  nd clues hidden among massive amounts of data. The character must have a suf ciently large sample enough time to study, as determined by the gamemaster. This might range from a few hours of listening to a spoken transhuman language to a few days of investigating inscriptions left by long-dead aliens to a week or more of researching a lengthy cipher. Languages may be comprehended by reading or listening to them being spoken. Apply a +20 modi er to any appropriate Language, Investigation, Research, or cod-breaking Tests (note that this does not apply to Infosec Tests made by software to decrypt a code). The async may also use this ability to more easily learn new languages, reducing the training time by half.
Predictive Boost (passive, self, automatic, constant): The Bayesian probability machine features of the async’s brain are boosted by this sleight, enhancing their ability to estimate and predict outcomes of events around them as they unfold in real-time and update those predictions as information changes. In effect, the character has a more intuitive sense for which outcomes are most likely. This grants the character a +10 bonus on any skill tests that involve predicting the outcome of events. It also bolsters the async’s decision-making in combat situations by making the best course of action more clear, and so provides a +10 bonus to both Initiative and Fray Tests.
Skinlink (moderate/1000): Skinlink nanobots live on the morph’s external skin or shell, automatically swarming over and creating a physical connection with any electronics the user touches. They also take advantage of the electrical  eld in a biomorph’s skin for communication. They allow the user to communicate and mesh with any devices merely by touching them. This is considered a wired link, and so is not subject to wireless interception or interference. Two skinlinked characters can also communicate and mesh simply by touching.
Smart Vac Clothing (moderate/1000): Just like regular smart clothing, this outfit can also transform into a light vacsuit (p. 333). It also functions as armor with a rating of 2/4.

I messed up on the math about 90% of the way through (imagine that!) but I think I fixed all the skills. I have a little more detailed sequence of events that I built by if it's necessary, otherwise I should be able to dig into the plethora of Moxie to adjust anything that needs it. I am satisfied with this character but if he doesn't quite fit with the group or whatever I'm willing to change things around a bit. If I end up making any changes I'll note it below.
**Edit:** Apparently you can't have a Moxie stat greater than 10. I'll have to exchange the extra for something else... suggestions?

I don´t think it was anything overly military about the Futura project. Also, you can read up on it if you want, the only info I could find was in the end of the Psi section, I found nothing in the GM only section.

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-11 10:39:50)

Yeah I read that. I guess I don't entirely buy it - the project was sponsored by some hypercorps and "numerous other partners" with the intent on growing population and "aggressively" pursuing a new technological niche. I think it would be like saying the Clone Wars were about just keeping the peace - it's sort of true, but they weren't cloning moisture farmers. Either way, it's how Vincent perceives the project that matters since it's not likely to be easily researched.

Hey guys, I'm still plodding through the system bit by bit <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> It reminds me of Ghost In The Shell a lot. Quite tempted to play that premade character that exists purely in The Mesh and interacts with the physical world using automatons. But then again, I have an image of Gray Fox in my head from the MGS series of games.

That's what I came up with so far. Will add stat block and equipment when I get in <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> - For Gear are we taking the Average cost?
By Current counts I'm over by 28650 (expect edits as I go along (like probably dropping Quantum Computer)
EDIT: 18650 now <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
EDIT 2: Took off the quantum comp. so that's an extra 20k creds back. 1350 in the black now <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Yeah I was going to say! 16 Moxie is over the limit of 10 <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> So if you drop it by 6 that's an extra 90cp to spend on stuff. Perhaps rep? Although looks like you've nearly saturated that (can only spend 50 more I think by my calc). Or maybe Cred? Or why not just plough it into gear or skills <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Heh I have no ideas lol

I need to read up on the Lore and then I'll flesh out my backstory. But consider my character (whose name I'm still unsure of) a gun/blade for hire for the corporations when they need to conduct corporate espionage between one another. You need something from a secure "server" in the HQ of Goliath National Bank? I'm your man lol. Char updated. Not sure how we're doing gear. We working off Average cost? Also with motivations, we don't *have* to take a negative do we?

lol I was going to suggest changing my build or doing a completely different one with that *exact* MO (Hypercorps mercenary with something like **+Wealth +Personal Honor +Minimalist**). My extra points will probably be thrown into some more implants or something, I don't know yet. Gear is working off of Average cost though, I'm pretty sure DA said that above somewhere. I don't think there needs to be a negative motivation since it could easily be expressed as a positive of its opposite. "+Fame" is almost the same as "-Obscurity" unless you're riding the nuance. I don't know when I'll have another chunk of time to devote to working on my character so it may be a couple days.

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-13 10:11:08)

Yeah I was gonna go for Exotropian(?) but the skill bonuses (persuasion, but don't fit with my character...I'd rather have him say as little as possible) didn't really fly. anyway I read in the CRB that faction doesn't really matter because you could just be a radical in your own faction. Anyway Exotropians seem to be a cross between Hypercrops and Anarchists from what I've read and they pretty much share my beliefs anyway <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Yeah I might get some more implants/traits just to give him a few quirks

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-13 10:36:23)

Also, sorry for another double post, but Railguns can only be used with Regular or Armor-Piercing ammunition. Does that mean I can't use Smart Ammo modifiers to them?
For example: Homing/Accushot Regular or Homing/Accushot Armor-Piercing

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-13 10:44:27)

Also on the subject of ammo and since we are using average costs. Are ammo costs PER round? PER Magazine? PER crate of magazines?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-13 10:52:22)

OK, I´ll get to making individual assessments of your characters shortly, but some general answers to questions here, as well as some additional guidelines:

* No, smart ammo may not be used with railguns (pg 338)
* No, you don´t have to take a "negative" motivation, because like BW said, you can often express such a thing as something else. Sometimes it might be tricky to find something that says the exact opposite of what you want, so it might be easier to say "I oppose this…"
* For gear you can use the average costs, yes. You can also leave out average DVs for weapons since we will be rolling dice. Also it would be easier if you list weapons and ammunition separately.
* When listing skills, what is important is your **linked aptitude**, **skill base**, **morph bonus** and **skill total**. Skill base is the value of your linked aptitude plus any bonuses gained from background/faction, plus any CP you spent on increasing the skill. Morph bonus is included in your skill total, but it should be separated from your skill base for a few reasons. In short, only list these things, and not things like conditional or temporary modifiers from implants, psi or traits - list these things somewhere else.
* Ammo costs are per 100 rounds.

I hope that answers some questions.

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-13 11:17:39)

Bah thought they could be combined with the regular ammo for these purposes. No bother, saves me a few grand <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-13 11:18:26)

Thanks DA. I also realized I didn't spend any CP on my starting morph which I think I'm supposed to have done, so I'll re-work and re-format the numbers for you soon. Unless I have some major new discovery in the Lore (which is entirely possible since I'm still reading through it all), the character concept will remain pretty much the same. I may go ahead and make a more soldier build while I'm at it too, just to have some options.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-13 12:01:19)

Silly BW! Of course your Morph costs! Although tbh...I'm tempted to buy them with creds. 65CP versus 40k creds doesn't really make sense lol. But I think it's an ingame cost rather than pre-game.
Character Update Log: Spoilered most stuff, broke down weapons and ammo, put a build cost up at the bottom, added some more traits, dropped the quantum comp and got some more creds <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-13 13:54:57)

My original concept :P But the whole of the systems freaked me out. I may have glossed over the middle section of the book and just had a look into Hacking...etc. Which in itself is uber compelx!

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-13 15:39:15)

Yeah, I think that's why I'm shying away from Vincent - there's a lot of baggage with playing an async that I don't think I'll really be able to stay committed to. Who wants to roleplay PTSD *really*? The whole survivor/horror angle appeals to me for the simple reason that I probably won't have enough bullets to take care of all the enemies and I sort of got carried away and forgot that. It usually takes me a couple builds to grasp the system anyway.
So now I'm going with an Infomorph that likes to make art with his assault rifle. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-13 22:57:44)

Dang this Character Creation process is lengthy! You sort of have to know everything you want in advance before you start the math. I finished the actual numbers for my AGI soldier a bit ago and I'm just working on the text now. I think it all checks out. I'll edit over this post. If it looks like Vincent is a better choice to round out the team, I'll go with him but if it's alright with ya'll I think I'll take this guy. Anyway. Enjoy your evening!

Sorry DA, I got lost in some things there for a bit. I'll just play the *Ultimate Merc* from the sample characters since that's close to what I've been trying to make with the Infomorph build anyway. Vincent can wait until I understand the system a little better. Thanks! <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

Waiting for feedback on the build <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> then I'll right the background up. I've got a load of lore noted so shouldnt be too difficcult now

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-17 17:55:17)

DA - do you have a particular stat block format in mind? I'll try to have my character's background and official sheet up for Monday night but I think I really will stick with that Ultimate Merc sample character. I may change a few little things but nothing major.
If I may be so bold, I'm discovering that I think the 300/400 parameter for knowledge/active skills is unnecessary and should be more of a House Rule. I think something like "500pts of skills" would be better. Just my opinion at the moment. Have you noticed that Ming fellow is quoted in the Corebook? I forget the page... somewhere in the *Gazeteer* section. Something about Mars. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-19 10:37:06)

I think the 700pt minimum for skills is ok, it means people don't over build their morphs with hundreds of upgrades <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Ming the Merciless? or Ming Dynasty?

There's a snippet on one of the pages in the CRB (I think it's on the top-left) by that guy. It says something like "*Once upon a time there was a primitive planet that still used money. It's called Mars.*"
I'll stat up the Sample Merc tonight and get him posted in here. Sorry for the delay - lots going on around the BW casa.

You follow your own path, however, and when you cease to learn from an experience or increase your own personal capabilities you will move on to the next. You mostly find employment in the inner system, where various social cliques and hypercorps favor ultimates like yourself, knowing they are less likely to be tempted or subverted by rivals. In the end it doesn’t matter who pays the credit; you’ll take from them, learn from them, and be here long after they’ve destroyed themselves with their petty intrigues and flawed ideologies.*
My thoughts with this build (I changed the starting credits and cashed in some grenades to buy Vacuum Sealed and Grip Pads so I can crawl around outside a ship) are pretty straight-forward: follow what they had in mind as best I can. It's a stereotypical mercenary character and I thought it might be best, given his personal outlook, if he no longer had a proper name but just a title that people used when hiring him. I looked up warrior-philosophers and Sparta was the obvious choice and that was almost his name (Spartan) but to avoid the Halo connotations and because I really enjoy watching Samurai Jack, I went with what's up there. I'm looking forward to getting into this character a lot and I'd rather not add a whole lot of my own descriptive stuff beforehand. Physically the picture in the CRB works just fine.

Whenever I hear Jack and mechs I think of:

I think the 700pt requirement for skills is good, and my guess is that it´s a balance issue. Without it, certain builds - namely those that uses a lot of skills linked to the same aptitude - would be better off by raising their aptitudes than raising skills. COG for example, which governs the majority of field and mesh skills would be a prime example. For a knowledgeable and academic mesh hacker every point of COG would correspond to a massive amount of points in skills, and once the number of skills gets above 10, you effectively "save" CP by upping the aptitude instead of the skills.
If you want to go with that character BW that´s ok, but I´d personally recommend making your own character, for a number of reasons. But mainly because I find the stocks ones to be a bit boring in execution, and also because the character you start with is very much what you will be playing. IMO/E, character development in these systems are very slow, and usually consists of upping success chances of some skills by a few percent every now and then.

I see what you mean about the skill I guess, it just seems weird to me. If I can manage a build I will but I just had a meeting today that may very well means lots of work for BW. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Sorry for being so nonresponsive on this, I´ve been a bit busy, plus when BW dropped out this kind of fell into the back. But if people are still interested I´ll make some refocused efforts to look over characters, and we could try running with only 2 characters.
Anyone else willing to apply is of course still welcome to do so.

I might try to apply for this, but I need to look over all of the books and see if I can toss a character together.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-04-04 09:55:18)

That shouldn´t be much trouble seeing as there´s only one book <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Bio: Daegin was born on a research facility and as soon as he was old enough he chose to transfer his mind into an Octomorph. He had always admired the way that the moved fluidly. He was a teen when the Fall happened and he always felt that humanity should reclaim earth. One of his dreams has always been to swim in the oceans of the earth. He got a job as a Lab technician where he learned how to program and modify the nanoswarms used in his habitat to help facilitate repairs. He quickly learned how to work on and program computers and nanobots. One day he heard a call from Magnus Ming about needing help and he jumped at it since he would love to work with TITAN technology.
Description: A slightly smaller Octomorph that is a dark brown, almost black, color over his entire body with a slightly lighter brown around his face. He wears a simple utility belt that is made of a brown leather.

I don't know if any of you are still interested in this, but there's open recruitment on Myth-Weavers right now for an EP game. I had to come back to see my old character, so I figured I'd give ya'll a heads up. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->
