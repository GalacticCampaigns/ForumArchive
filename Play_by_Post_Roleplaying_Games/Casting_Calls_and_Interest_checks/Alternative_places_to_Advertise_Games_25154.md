Also, I"m quite willing to allow a GM to run a game on my site,
[http://www.whidbeygamers.net.](http://www.whidbeygamers.net. "http://www.whidbeygamers.net.")
If anyone registers for the site, there is a 'validation' block that comes up. All one has to do to 'pass' it is tell me who referred them (such as Galactic Campaigns), and I'll ok their account straightaway.
You might not be able to attract many players there though, our numbers have fallen off considerably recently. Only have two games going right now, one Star Wars Saga Edition, and one Pathfinder game.
