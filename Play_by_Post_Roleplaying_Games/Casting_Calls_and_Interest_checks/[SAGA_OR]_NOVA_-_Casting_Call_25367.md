# [SAGA OR] NOVA - Casting Call

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-17 11:46:24)

The galaxy flourishes, filled with rich trade, mystery and intrigue at every corner, political power, and strife. Over the past few centuries the known galaxy has expanded under the guidance and territorial expansion of the Hertulle Monarchy, a group of commonwealth systems under the rule of noble families, the Imperial Regime, an empire of militarily controlled systems under the strict tyrannical control of a cabinet of experienced power hungry military leaders, and the Republic, a group of peaceful systems founded by a democratic senate. Although the galaxy has not seen all out war for a millennia, many claim to see it coming. Territorial skirmishes occurring at the borders and another rush of exploration ships deeper into the Outer Rim and Fringe areas of space have increased the tensions among the core systems.
Playing in the shadows is a growing criminal empire known as the Syndicate. Specializing in smuggling and the black market they have worked their corruption into almost every system and government. To further galactic social unease is the appearance of beings capable of unexplainable abilities. An almost cult like religious following has developed in less developed systems while a general distrust of these beings formed in the core systems.
With the Imperial Regime growing more aggressive in their expansion, and the Hertulle Monarchy closing their borders in a near xenophobic display and the discovery of ruins in multiple systems in the fringe territories dating thousands of years back the Republic has begun to try to unite the galaxy under a single government. They began sending agents out to search for talented individuals to form a group, NOVA, tasked with the more difficult and dangerous diplomatic and, if required, military missions to bring peace to the galaxy.
*On Commenor in the city of Kliffen at a local pub, the "Starlight," a pair of gentlemen sit across from each other in a large booth. Each were well dressed though no distinctions could be made of their political affiliation. The younger, almost half the others age, looked to his companion and broke the silence between the two with a question.*
**"Sir, do you think this program will really work?"**
In an aged and grizzled voice he looked back and said with assurance, **"I wouldn't have fought as hard as I did to get it approved if I didn't. My concern is how many will answer the call of the agents I sent out."**
He pulled out a small data pad and scrolled through some files for a moment then looked around the pub casually before putting it away.
Big 16
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

1. What game system are you running (D&D, Call of Cthulu, Palladium, GURPS, etc.), and if applicable what edition (Original, Classic, Revised, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 10th, etc.)?
**Star Wars Saga Edition**
2. What 'type' or variant of game will it be (i.e. "Shadow Chasers" or "Agents of Psi" for d20 Modern)? What is the setting for the game (eg. historic period, published or homebrewed campaign setting, alternate reality, modern world, etc.)?
**Alternate Star Wars Universe, approximately Old Republic Era.**
3. How many Players are you looking for? Will you be taking alternates, and if so, how many?
**4-8 players. Taking character applications up to July 31st 2013. Game to start on August 7th 2013.**
4. What's the gaming medium (OOTS, chat, e-mail etc.)?
**PbP on Galactic Campaigns Forum. Will be monitoring the game thread daily and post at very least on M-W-F.**
5. What is the characters' starting status (i.e. experience level)?
**Characters will start at Level 5.**
6. How much gold or other starting funds will the characters begin with?
**Max starting credits plus 5000 credits and any given by feats or skills.**
7. Are there any particular character classes, professions, orders, etc. that you want... or do not want? What are your rules on 'prestige' and/or homebrewed classes?
**All found within Core rulebook and Source books with exception to Force based classes. Characters can pick these up later in campaign but are allowed to start with force sensitivity and entry level powers/abilities.**
8. What races, subraces, species, etc. are allowed for your game? Will you allow homebrewed races or species? 'Prestige' races or species?
**I will accept most races, including droids (limit to no more than 2 droids in the party) that would normally be found during the Old Republic Time Era**
9. By what method should Players generate their attributes/ability scores and Hit Points?
**Characters will have a 34 point buy in (Droids 30) and begin with maximum hit points for each level.**
10. Does your game use alignment? What are your restrictions, if so?
**Yes, through Dark Side points. Not as ambiguous as the book goes but definitely anything that would inherently be seen as "evil" would grant dark side points and its side effects.**
11. Do you allow multi-classing, or have any particular rules in regards to it?
**Yes. No restrictions except those outlined in the rule books.**
12. Will you be doing all of the die rolling during the course of the game? Will die rolls be altered, or left to the honor system? If players can make die rolls, which ones do they make, how should they make the rolls, and how should they report them?
**Yes die rolls will occur during game. All die rolls will be placed in hidden "spoiler" box at end of post along with any OOC information required.**
13. Are there any homebrewed or optional/variant rules that your Players should know about? If so, list and explain them, or provide relevant links to learn about these new rules.
**The galaxy is in an alternate state of existence. Many of the historical events from the known universe did not occur. Various information will be posted in a thread with the game.**
14. Is a character background required? If so, how big? Are you looking for anything in particular (i.e. the backgrounds all ending up with the characters in the same city)?
**Yes. At least a few lines providing an insight to the character's recent history. Characters will begin at Kliffen, Commenor, either because they were contacted by an agent or because they were just there when everything starts up.**
15. Does your game involve a lot of hack & slash, puzzle solving, roleplaying, or a combination of the above?
**There will be a fair mixture of puzzle solving and hack and slash, and hopefully a large amount of roleplaying of all of it.**
16. Are your Players restricted to particular rulebooks and supplements, or will you be allowing access to non-standard material? What sources can Players use for their characters?
**Currently all SAGA Sourcebooks are allowed. If a question comes up regarding anything particular found in a source book I have overlooked it will be discussed at that time.**

</details>

So overall this is an alternate universe. Many of the events that happened in known timeline did not happen after the great hyperspace wars. This is a chance to see the Republic rise with success or fall and let the Empire take full control of the galaxy. The option is up to the characters as the game rolls on, though they will start with working for the Republic.
At a glance :
**Starting Level**  : 5
 **Attributes**  : 34 (30 Droid) points
 **HP**  : Max per level
 **Credits**  : Max starting + 5000
 **Starting Class Restrictions**  : Force Based Classes
 **Equipment Restrictions** : Old Republic Era. All books can be used but equipment found only after Battle of Endor will not be used.
Any other questions? Something not quite clear? Ask. I look forward to you character concepts.

If your still wanting to run this I'd be interested in joining.
Just let me know if you want me to join.
If it helps I have all the saga books and should be able to get on quite regularly.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-18 01:13:04)

Tiger, before posting check the dates. This is a brand new thread meaning it is a new game looking for players. Read through the Big 16 and generate a character sheet.
For attribute buy in I'd use this :
<!-- m -->[http://swrpgrc.com/statTool/](http://swrpgrc.com/statTool/ "http://swrpgrc.com/statTool/")<!-- m -->
There is also a drop down selection on new posts for a format. Use it to create the sheet then remove any lines that don't pertain to your character.
Once done submit here and I'll review it and let you know if you missed anything or need to make corrections. At the deadline I will let everyone know who is accepted.

### **Duggs** (2013-06-18 03:42:41)

I will start working on a character as soon as I can.

### **TigerEagle** (2013-06-18 08:53:32)

Hello
Just a query how much ship to ship combat will there be?

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-18 09:43:35)

Initially it will be limited but I plan to have small and large scale battles later in the game, deeper in the campaign.

### **Halfbat** (2013-06-18 16:26:10)

Working on a character. So far he's:
Toran Pelor, an ineffective human smuggler who has had numerous run-ins with customs. Whilst he has lost a great deal of contraband he has also had a suprising amount of luck when he's really needed it. He's starting to develop a tendency to rely on his instincts and gut because, well, they have gotten him out of some big scrapes and when he's ignored them, he has always fallen foul of the customs, gangmembers, drugrunners, Hutts...
He's recently become really uncomfortable with his role in life, too, as if he should be concerned with much more than himself. It's as if he's... *connected*, somehow, with everyone else and he's not sure how.... So a new trade is on the horizon.
If Force Sensitive, can we select Force talents and Force feats, such as Force Training, Force Boon and even Skill Training(Use the Force)?

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-18 16:48:22)

Halfbat - yes they can choose force related skills and abilities but no Force classes to start with.
Looks like a good start for your character. A scoundrel turned something more.

### **The Imperator** (2013-06-18 22:33:29)

I would really enjoy joining this game, but before I set down to creating any characters, I wanted to see if my primary idea is feasible for this game; haven't decided male or female yet, but here is my idea:
My character would be a gladiator, or at least on the way to becoming one. Born on a small mid rim world, he/she was a slave as a child, forced to fight animals for her master's enjoyment. Years of this left her/him with scars from implants, and permanent brain issues. By the time she/he turned 20, the results of the constant implants and fighting left her/him unable to experience happiness except from the thrill of fighting. As hostilities break out, his/her world is caught in the crossfire of expanding Imperials and the Republic, and he/she is discovered by NOVA...
Yes, I will write up a lot more if I use it, but is this a good direction to take the character in?

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-18 22:43:02)

Looks good to me, little more to flesh out perhaps but I think it could be worked in.

---

### **Duggs** (2013-06-18 23:23:47)

Here is my concept, and character background if you allow it. If you allow it I would like to use the Background Gamorr for my character. He will be a human scout.
Verin spent the first few years of his life on a ship, until it was attacked by a group of pirates and his family's ship crashed on Gamorr, killing his mother in the crash. The ship was damaged beyond repair and the crew had to start worrying about survival on such a violent planet. He grew up learning survival techniques from Clan Bk'trugh that had taken in his family, and the crew from their ship. The Clan became like another family to him. He was taught how to fight and survive by his father, and the Gamorreans, alike. He quickly learned how to wield an axe, though he could never build up the strength to wield the Gamorrean arg'garok, as he helped out with chores and gathering of firewood. When Verin came of age he entered himself in a tournament to first blood that the clan was holding, though he did not win the tournament he had defeated 2 other Gamorrean Boars and had earned his right to the Clan Bk'trugh tattoo that all members had on their arms. As he had gotten older he had realized that his father had been getting progressively ill. No matter what was done to help Verin's Dad it all seemed to be fruitless. Before his Dad finally passed away he gave Verin his prized rifle, that had been handed down from his own father, Bodkinn Kanuzaki. He then told Verin that his grandfather had been a famous mercenary that had been known as Bodkinn Black. He found the story of his grandfather astonishing and a few months after his father passed away he decided that he wanted to head out and see if he could make a name for himself. He waved goodbye to the Gomorreans that he had come to know and love and then he caught a ride with a traveling merchant. He has picked up a few odd jobs tracking down small time criminals, and sometimes the innocent, though for that the money has to be right. The only rule that he has is that he won't accept a contract on a child, which is the same rule that his grandfather had had. He has noticed that his skills seem to be heightened at times, though he assumes it is just his training with the Gamorreans, he can't help but wonder if there may be something more to it. He recently spoke to an agent about a program called NOVA and he is currently heading to the meeting place that the agent informed him of.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-19 00:00:15)

Simple enough, with force sensitivity I persume. Looks like a good concept. Go for it.
Looks like we have the minimum to play once all characters are finalized. Wonder if we'll get more by the dead line?

---

### **The Imperator** (2013-06-19 00:44:07)

Alright, her it goes. I think I will go with female, stat build will be up later but here is the backstory.
Miral of Sansas
Born to two human slaves on a small Mi-Rim world, Miral's first site was the leering face of her owner, a fat, corpulent Twi'lek named Kalath Drono. His leering face leaned over her, the smile growing as Drono realized Miral was a girl. That was the last time her parents ever saw her.
From the day she could walk, she served as a source of pleasure for Drono, be it fighting animals, fighting other children, or.. other things. By the time she was five, she had already killed 5 other children, former play mates. With each death, she increased in skill, but the pain she felt from killing playmates left her broken. Every night she cried herself to sleep, knowing the next morning she would have to kill, or fight, something close to her. By the time she turned 7, she gave up on attachments.
The next decade of her life was monotony, constant fighting and killing. By the time she was 10, she gave up counting how many peers she had killed. Throughout this time, Drono's scientists experimented with implants on her, heedless of the damage they were doing. Each implant, crudely shoved in, pushed her to new heights of violence, increasing her pleasure and adrenaline every time she killed. But, with each use, the implants burned out; a new one would be added, the results would be cataloged, Drono would sell the results to mercenary groups, ostensibly to improve fighting abilities. And Miral's life spun on filled with blood and death, and she was left dulled to all sensations but pain and the thrill of fighting.
But, when she turned 18, Drono lost interest in her, turning his attention again to newly born younger slaves. Now left without any purpose, even that of plotting revenge on the man who had controlled her life. Thrown into the gladiatorial arena, she slaughtered her way through countless opponents. With each victory, she wrote the name of the enemy she killed and attached it to her armor; in her moments of absolute clarity after, she felt remorse for the deaths she caused, saving their names to remind her of her broken nature and desire for revenge.
After 5 years in gladiatorial arenas, fighting broke out between the Imperials and the Republic, her world caught in the crossfire. Seizing the opportunity, she butchered her way gleefully through the arena's guards, escaping to a Republic ship. Once aboard, she was tranquilized and restrained, and a man from something called NOVA told her of how she could serve the Republic...
Personality: Miral is gruff, harsh, and sarcastic. She tries to provoke battles with others, just to help her feel something. In her moments of real clarity, she feels remorse for the hundreds of gory, butchering deaths she has caused, but those moments are few and far between now that she is not constantly fighting. She longs for battle, and revels in all confrontations.
[Here is her picture](http://gallery.burrowowl.net/images/4c/4cee69f5c656ee041e59ceda065b8d40 "http://gallery.burrowowl.net/images/4c/4cee69f5c656ee041e59ceda065b8d40"), I don't know etiquette for this board yet, is it alright to just post pictures? And is this the thread where I post stats?
Is this a good backstory, or should I add a little more?

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-19 01:02:31)

Yes there is a format for stats and you would post to this thread. It can be found in the drop down menu when creating a post. Select the one for Saga and input as required, remove lines not used for clarity. Another great tool is Weavers. <!-- m -->[http://www.myth-weavers.com](http://www.myth-weavers.com "http://www.myth-weavers.com")<!-- m -->.
Also you can use the "spoiler" tag to hide long parts (such as background) when you post the complete sheet with stats. Also, please annotate character level progression at the end. Makes it a little easier to verify if feats, skills, and abilitues have been selected in correct order and prerequisites are met and none are missed.
Once characters are confirmed I'll let you know where to post it and which thread the game will run on.

### **Halfbat** (2013-06-19 06:29:19)

How about posting a quick summary of characters, too, with the stats? One or two sentences? Whilst backgrounds are fun I, at least, often find it really difficult to work out the essence of a character from long backgrounds.

Does a "Personality" section work? I had put that in mine, standard practice from other places I've done this.

Born to two human slaves on a small Mi-Rim world, Miral's first site was the leering face of her owner, a fat, corpulent Twi'lek named Kalath Drono. His leering face leaned over her, the smile growing as Drono realized Miral was a girl. That was the last time her parents ever saw her.
From the day she could walk, she served as a source of pleasure for Drono, be it fighting animals, fighting other children, or... other things. By the time she was five, she had already killed 5 other children, former play mates. With each death, she increased in skill, but the pain she felt from killing playmates left her broken. Every night she cried herself to sleep, knowing the next morning she would have to kill, or fight, something close to her. By the time she turned 7, she gave up on attachments altogether.
The next decade of her life was monotony, constant fighting and killing. By the time she was 10, she gave up counting how many peers she had killed. Throughout this time, Drono's scientists experimented with implants on her, heedless of the damage they were doing. Each implant, crudely shoved in, pushed her to new heights of violence, increasing her pleasure and adrenaline every time she killed. But, with each use, the implants burned out; a new one would be added, the results would be cataloged, Drono would sell the results to mercenary groups, ostensibly to improve fighting abilities. And Miral's life spun on filled with blood and death, her only periods of peace when the implants were working, dulling her to all physical sensations.
Beyond the science team Drono controlled, there were also more... esoteric endeavors that Drono pursued. These agents were rumored to have magical powers, the ability to throw lightning, see the future, or even read minds. Whatever the truth to these satements, Miral simply knew them as the beings that would catch her when she escaped, using what appeared to be magic.
But, when she turned 18, Drono lost interest in her, turning his attention again to newly born younger slaves. Now left without any purpose, even that of plotting revenge on the man who had controlled her life, she was thrown into the gladiatorial arena, where she slaughtered her way through countless opponents. With each victory, she became harder and harder, content to give in to the adrenaline rush that fighting brought her. With each victory, she wrote and affixed the name of her opponent to her armor.
After 5 years in gladiatorial arenas, fighting broke out between the Imperials and the Republic, her world caught in the crossfire. Seizing the opportunity, she butchered her way gleefully through the arena's guards, escaping to a Republic ship. Once aboard, she was tranquilized and restrained, and a man from something called NOVA told her of how she could serve the Republic...

</details>

Personality And appearance: Miral is gruff, harsh, but acts more than she talks. She tries to provoke battles with others, seeking the sense of normalcy that constant fighting, just as in her youth, brings her. Miral is about 1.8 meters tall, well muscled, and covered in scars on her arms and torso. Her eyes are a vibrant blue, standing out in her tanned face. Her hair is black.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-20 00:28:11)

Haven't had a chance to really dig into it but I see that you still swapped for advanced melee at lvl 1.
But apparently the post I made earlier never cleared server so I'll state again and hope it goes through this time.
Answer to 1st question: no feat swapping but you can use one of your 1st level feats to obtain it. Humans get an additional feat, so class starting feats +2 at first level.
Q2 : unless the armor specifically states it in description it does not. It can be added but at cost of an upgrade slot and credits. Equipment start with limited slots based on type so plan accordingly
Q3 : yes, just pay for the upgrades and assume first time installation success for initial build.
Additional notes:
Please list each weapon individually under Melee/Ranged and use format "weaponname attmod (dam die)"
Dam die is not needed under posessions since it would be already previously listed. Possessions of restricted or higher either need to be concealable or have a license or expect issues in some of the areas the group travels to. In brackets [ ] after item please place item cost and license fee IE [400+80L]

**Appearance**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

He isn't the biggest of men. He stands at 5'6" and is 165 lbs. He has black hair that has been cut short and spiked, a blackish red goatee and he has brown eyes. He wears a dark blue shirt and black pants with a utility belt. An empty hip holster can be seen on his right hip, with an axe hanging off of his left. He wears his hunting rifle hanging on his back, or side if he is sitting. He has the sleeves of his all temperature cloak rolled up, so that it is short sleeved like his shirt, and his Clan Bk'trugh tattoos can be seen on his arms. He is also wearing a pair of fingerless gloves.

</details>

Here is my character so far. I didn't buy the license for my rifle, and I am unsure how much it would cost to get it, but I wasn't sure if my character would have the license for it since it was passed down to him and he didn't go out and buy it new.

Hmmm, so no feat swapping? Then can I just not take Weapon Prof (Rifle) and be short a feat? My character was supposed to have been raised a gladiator, never using guns. Plus, having the feat didn't fit with the aesthetic of the character, she'd be as proficient in rifles as a Jedi is. Also, sorry for just assuming I could do that; I have been playing for years with GMs whose House Rules allow that. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> I will add it if you really want, but I will continue to play the character like she does not know how to use guns, for consistency's sake. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Sorry I've kept doing stuff wrong, first time on a new board and all that.

Seeing your point. Since your background covers

Hello I've made two characters encase one would suit the group more than the other
I'm not sure if we post our characters here or not if not let me know and I'lll remove the post. Thanks Tiger.
The first is a young chiss by the name of Ellisan, she was originally part of the Chiss military but on her first mission she lead it went horrible wrong and she was exiled. In her exile she managed to stumble upon a group of Mandalorians. And managed to steal a suit of their armour which was modified. She successful got a small bit of training in a planets militia but ended up leaving due to a job she got. After taking varies jobs ranging from smuggling to mercenary work to trying to ends meat. She was also always wanting to find a way to redeem herself. Final she hears the call to NOVA and believes here is her chance and makes her way to the city of Kiffen and finally to the local pub ‘starlight’ where she hopes to join the task force.

The second is a rash and reckless Bothan by the name of Tav Fey'jeg. He was found to be a natural leader and was recruited into the officer training program in the Bothan military. After the Bothan military heard the call from NOVA for recruits for the program, they recommended their reckless officer Tav Fey’jeg (nicked named “gambler” by his fellow colleagues because of his risky tactics that somehow always paid off) both because he’s good and because they don’t want him influencing the other officers being trained to be reckless and risky.

**Personality**
Previously cocky, gung-ho, happy-go-lucky, self-focussed, assured and happy in a life that laughed at authority (he has killed or harmed no-one), Toran is becoming a more thoughtful seeker, curious about this almost spiritual aspect to life that has grown around him. Still assured, with a “can-do” attitude, his insights into the atrocities of crime cartels has caused him to regret the support he gave them and has, in general, curbed his excesses; the wish to redress the balance has given him the drive to join NOVA.

**Brief Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Toran Pelor, an ineffective human smuggler who has had numerous run-ins with customs. Whilst he has lost a great deal of contraband he has also had a suprising amount of luck when he's really needed it. He's starting to develop a tendency to rely on his instincts and gut because, well, they have gotten him out of some big scrapes and when he's ignored them, he has always fallen foul of the customs, gangmembers, drugrunners, Hutts... the anstier it is, the more his instincts have helped.
He’s increasingly focussed on this ‘gut’ and has found it can help him influence others in tight spots and boost his own skills (he has made jumps that even he could not believe). Few others seem to have quite the same instinct, so it’s an edge he's wanted to explore for a while. Using it and relaxing *into* it seems to work....
His smuggling activities to date have been with masters who are normally committed to smuggling luxury goods or artwork. On a recent smuggling run, though, he found that some of the objets d’art were filled with a particularly addictive and potentially fatal drug: the only cure was to take more. This was deliberately being dumped into the shanty-towns of the under-class to turn a whole quarter into the personal, totally dependent, slave army of a particularly obnoxious Hutt.
Though told to keep his mouth shut, Toran found that the fear and desperation of those accepting delivery were completely overwhelming – it was as if something in that terrified and desperate populace was seriously affecting him. Driven by their need, he could do nothing else but relieve them of that through bringing the problem to the authorities and, in supporting the police, killing the Hutt himself when the advisory group he was with was ambushed.
As a result, he's become really uncomfortable with his role in life, as if he should be concerned with much more than himself. It's as if he's... connected, somehow, with everyone else and he's not sure how. It can be extremely unpleasant, this being driven to think of others or being driven to redress imbalance, but he is impelled to do so.
Wisdom is growing and a new trade is on the horizon.

I don't know what the boss will say, but I like this concept. Rash & reckless vs. need to survive = fun! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

I didn't get a chance this weekend to do a full review on the submitted characters. Wife gave me a very long to do list preparing for party we have coming up. Don't worry, I'll get to them. Deadline is not for a few more weeks, hoping to see more applicants.

### **Halfbat** (2013-06-28 13:25:29)

Having let him ice for a few days, Toran may be better with a more defensive, personal power like Resist Force or Energy Resistance - probably the latter - as it would explain his "lucky escapes" more coherently. He's not really a killer!

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-28 13:28:44)

I am planning on overhauling the little details of my characters' backstory, but the general backstory will stay the same. It won't affect any of the stats, just some little details I don't like now that I look back on them. But I won't probably do it till after you look at the characters.

Okay ive done some initial digging into the characters. So far nothing is screaming wrong at me. Now that ive got the core rulebooks on my tablet ill be able to finish the review of the characters this week.
That being said everyone can move thier characters to the game forum thread.
<!-- l -->[viewtopic.php?f=263&amp;t=25373](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=263&t=25373 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=263&t=25373")<!-- l -->
I should have a lot of the rest of the info uploaded by this weekend and the first game post as well.
I'll let anyone know if I do see something that will have to be adjusted on their character sheet in a few days. I appologize to everyone about the delays, life has been throwing multiple curve balls that I have been having to work around.

>
> Born to two human slaves on a small Mi-Rim world, Miral's first site was the leering face of her owner, a fat, corpulent Twi'lek named Kalath Drono. His leering face leaned over her, the smile growing as Drono realized Miral was a girl. That was the last time her parents ever saw her.
> From the day she could walk, she served as a source of pleasure for Drono, be it fighting animals, fighting other children, or... other things. By the time she was five, she had already killed 5 other children, former play mates. With each death, she increased in skill, but the pain she felt from killing playmates left her broken. Every night she cried herself to sleep, knowing the next morning she would have to kill, or fight, something close to her. By the time she turned 7, she gave up on attachments altogether.
> The next decade of her life was monotony, constant fighting and killing. By the time she was 10, she gave up counting how many peers she had killed. Throughout this time, Drono's scientists experimented with implants on her, heedless of the damage they were doing. Each implant, crudely shoved in, pushed her to new heights of violence, increasing her pleasure and adrenaline every time she killed. But, with each use, the implants burned out; a new one would be added, the results would be cataloged, Drono would sell the results to mercenary groups, ostensibly to improve fighting abilities. And Miral's life spun on filled with blood and death, her only periods of peace when the implants were working, dulling her to all physical sensations.
> Beyond the science team Drono controlled, there were also more... esoteric endeavors that Drono pursued. These agents were rumored to have magical powers, the ability to throw lightning, see the future, or even read minds. Whatever the truth to these satements, Miral simply knew them as the beings that would catch her when she escaped, using what appeared to be magic.
> But, when she turned 18, Drono lost interest in her, turning his attention again to newly born younger slaves. Now left without any purpose, even that of plotting revenge on the man who had controlled her life, she was thrown into the gladiatorial arena, where she slaughtered her way through countless opponents. With each victory, she became harder and harder, content to give in to the adrenaline rush that fighting brought her. With each victory, she wrote and affixed the name of her opponent to her armor.
> After 5 years in gladiatorial arenas, fighting broke out between the Imperials and the Republic, her world caught in the crossfire. Seizing the opportunity, she butchered her way gleefully through the arena's guards, escaping to a Republic ship. Once aboard, she was tranquilized and restrained, and a man from something called NOVA told her of how she could serve the Republic...

> Personality And appearance: Miral is gruff, harsh, but acts more than she talks. She tries to provoke battles with others, seeking the sense of normalcy that constant fighting, just as in her youth, brings her. Miral is about 1.8 meters tall, well muscled, and covered in scars on her arms and torso. Her eyes are a vibrant blue, standing out in her tanned face. Her hair is black.
