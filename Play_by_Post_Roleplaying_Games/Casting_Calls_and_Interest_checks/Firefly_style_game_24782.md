# Firefly style game

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-23 22:32:56)

I am interested in running a ship based game in the style of firefly. It would be a story of a ship and her crew. I am thinking it would be primarily character driven to start. You could be all members of a pirate crew, outer rim scouts, you could haul legit cargo, maybe smugglers or gun runners. I am thinking of running this in Legacy era so everything would be available. I am completely open to ideas for why your a crew. There would have to be positions filled like Captain, Pilot, Engineer ect. I'm not locked into using the saga system if anyone has a better suggestion. I'm thinking of starting out at 7th level so you could be at the start of your prestige class. I will work on details if there is enough intrest to warrant it.

I think someone tried to run a Firefly style game some time ago. Didn´t really get going, but I wouldn´t mind giving it a go. A Fringe campaign would be fun, though I´d probably like to be on the wrong side of the law for a change <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
If you want us to be able to be level 1 in a PrC though, you´ll have to start us off at level 8.

sounds interesting, specially with me watching Farscape right now <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

I'm interested I would like to play a techie of some sort.

### **Blackhat** (2010-08-24 02:15:24)

Well there is an actually Serenity RPG system that I've used before. It's mostly about dice step and character benefits/defects but not too complicated in the least.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-24 05:33:18)

I think you have enough interest to start working on the details <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-24 19:53:23)

Ok lets keep this going.
1. Anyone care what system we use? I figured Saga would be easiest since we all know it.
2. Suggestions for Ship name and type
3. What kind of character would you like to play
4. What type of group you would like to be Pirates, Smuggler, Mercenaries, ect

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-25 01:47:58)

1. I would vote for Saga.
2. I had an idea of a character that would naturally have a ship as part of his background, and then the others could be worked on board via background. I would suggest a Space Transport, of course, and for the sheet coolness factor, most likely a YT-series. To get the right feel, I think we should have an "unreliable" one as well.
3. I would like a to take the part of the pilot.
4. Smugglers <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->

### **Parmenter** (2010-08-25 01:52:28)

I'm good with Saga. For the ship, I have a couple that would work well (with deckplans) apart from the good ones that appear in the books. The group could also be like a sort of "A-Team." It would explain where we came from and the things we do to get by.
I don't have a preference on a character yet. Depends mostly on what type of game everyone wants to play. Though I think Old Republic or Rebellion would be better suited in terms of an Era. There should be a strong government in power, and Legacy, from what I understand, has several organizations constantly battling for power.

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-25 02:27:38)

1. saga
2. YT 2400 pllleaaaase? I can come up with names kinda easy, but not till i know what kinda ship. and i agree with DA, unreliable sounds good, and the kick-assery of a YT 2400 would be well balanced by being unreliable.
3. Captain, resident greedy bastard, always looking for a way to make a credit. Has the plans, calls the shots, but can't survive without his crew, and therefore keeps their comfort and profit in mind... right behind his own. Think Rygel from Farscape but not that ugly or cowardly, but close on the cowardly.
4. Whatever pays the most with the least risk <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-25 04:22:20)

I was hoping I could be captain, wanting to try out that "Starship-linked" destiny for a while now. But this ship is pretty much going to be our home, right, so perhaps we could all have that <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
I´ve never been a big fan of the YT-2400, always favored the YT-2000, probably from all the days I´ve spent playing X-Wing Alliance. Looking through the books for a more "uncommon" YT-freighter, I found one that seems to be a good smuggling vessel if you fix up its weak engines. The YU-410 Light Freighter (GaW, pg 55).
NOTE: It actually says "a smuggler´s dream" in the description <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-25 04:25:28)

Aww hell DA i thought you wanted to pilot. guess my position could be commander i reckon. although i kinda like the 'resident greedy bastard' or 'money man'. thinking noble, scoundrel, crime lord or noble scout outlaw, or charlatan or maybe...... hell idk <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-25 04:27:18)

Well, mainly, I just want it to be "my" ship <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-25 04:32:21)

but if you own it whats to stop the rest of you from tossing me out an airlock? <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-25 04:33:41)

I hadn´t thought about it that way. Now I want it to be my ship even more <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-25 04:46:26)

okay.... how bout you borrowed the money from me, and i'm along to make sure i get recompense? protecting the investment so to speak <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-25 04:51:16)

Hmm, could be, though I´d like to see more details first.

---

### **ganthet** (2010-08-25 10:37:35)

I will play Jane. I mean come on how wouldn't want to play Jane. Next to Mal hes awesome.

---

### **Frost** (2010-08-25 13:59:36)

1. Saga is fine
2. I'm partial to Citadel Cruiser's myself 100 tons of storage + 2 point docking points for fighters.
3. Chief Engineer tech specialist
4. Pirates or smugglers sounds fun to me, but the A-team idea is cool as well
So your gonna make a combat monkey Ganth?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-25 14:15:15)

A Citadel might be suitable if we decide to go pirating, but they´re not really attractive smuggling vessels.

---

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-25 18:04:25)

Ok Pirates or smuggler or maybe a little of both? Specialized crew of ship jackers?
Ship itself is up to you. The YT-series are highly upgradeable by design. Good choice for a smuggler vessel.
So I'm thinking 8th lvl So you can have a level of a prestige class if you desire.

### **Blackhat** (2010-08-25 21:23:07)

Oh yeah, the ship obviously has to be continually falling apart on you to point where the people living on it are afraid to sleep because something will give and they'll be sucked out into space. but there's not harm with having two pilots, as you need a co-pilot generally. Might want to iron out exactly what you want the crew to comprise of as far as skill sets and crew roles go.
There is, however, absolutely no harm to building a ship completely from scratch to better facilitate what you need.

### **Valheru** (2010-08-25 23:17:22)

I'm definitely interested.
1. I'm actually not that big of a Saga fan so I would be down for something else. I've never tried the Serenity RPG but I've heard good things about it. Apparently it's similar to Savage Worlds which I have tried and like. Starblazer Adventures is something Sketch has always talked about using for Star Wars, I don't know anything about it though. FATE would also be an option for a "rules light" game. All that being said I realize I'm in the minority here and I wouldn't not play simply because you choose Saga.
2. I do not have a big preference here as long as it's moderately sized.
3. Depends somewhat on number 4 but probably a Face/assistant techie
4. Smugglers. Others would be fun too but I like smugglers the best.

---

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-26 01:03:23)

The Fate system seems to be easy to learn but I wouldn't want to step on Sketch's toes by stealing his idea. Plus everyone would have to learn the rules and get access to a book.
As far a positions on the ship
**Captain** every ship needs one doesn't have to be the pilot mind you. Mal didn't fly Serenity himself. Could be the "Face" of the crew tracking down jobs and making contacts
**Pilot/Co-pilot** Co-pilot may not be necessary depending on how many players we get
**Mechanic/Engineer**
**Weapon specialist/Gunner**
**Doctor/Medic**
**Security/Muscle**
**A Face/Social character** Con man, Gambler, deal maker (If not handled by captain)
Anyone else have ideas?

I said "unreliable", not "ready to scrap" <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
I meant that to get the right "feel", it could be nice to have the ship be a bit quirky. Having the hyperdrive fail when you need to escape pursuit, or a stabilizer bang when you´re in the middle of an asteroid field makes for good drama and roleplaying opportunities. Come on, if the *Millennium Falcon* always worked like it should, would Star Wars be as much fun? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
If we decide on being pirates though, I´d probably suggest we get a more reliable ship.

and besides, i'll need something to spend all the money we'll be making on <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: --> <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->
