# (Interest Reb) Infinities: Killer of the Stars

### **ArcanaFang** (2011-06-21 16:00:20)

Hello there everyone, this is my attempt of a casting call for a campaign based in what would be the Rebellion Era, but in an Infinity Setting.
What is an Infinity Setting you say? (Just in case you really didn't know <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> ), means that canon in Star Wars can be bent, broken, and is assumed still part of the new setting, or infinity setting.
I tried this a long time ago, back whenever the Ultimate Sith Edition of TFU 1 came out and I got to play the extra Hoth and Tatooine levels of the game, but since the extra levels for TFU 2 have come out some time ago, adding to the already screwed up infinity that the games have made...I thought I would try running something fun and interesting in this style and give us all a kick in the pants into what we remember being canon and how I can strangle it with darkside goodness. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
(SPOILER ALERT - IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THE FORCE UNLEASHED DLC OR THE GAME, PLEASE READ NO FURTHER)
The game focuses around Galen Marek and his choice to kill Darth Vader instead of facing the Emperor in the ending events in the first Force Unleashed game. After this choice, Starkiller is damaged beyond bacta repair by the Emperor and is grafted with the same type of machine-aided living that his master, Darth Vader had. Before, I wanted to let the downloaded content to be before the roleplay itself, but I find it much more interesting to weave each little part of it into this timeline, further developing the player characters and this Infinity universe.
So simple and straight, this campaign will roughly take place during the first DLC mission, which finds the players on the planet of Tatooine. The Alliance has just made a strike from their hidden base and have retrieved the plans for the Death Star and hidden them within the droid R2-D2, who is followed by C-3PO. Players will take the role of Rebels or hired mercenaries for the Alliance who are in possession of said droids and are trying to get them off the planet. The game will begin at the hidden base just beneath the streets of Mos Eisley, where the heroes will meet up with a commander within the Rebel Alliance.
Some things I can promise about the campaign are this:
This will be fun.
Being an Infinity Setting, I want the players to have a great influence on the story.
You will meet characters from the classic trilogy and ultimately, decide some of their fates.
Being a story-driven quest, there will be plenty of combat to go along and make things interesting.
So, before I make any other details, would anyone be interested?

This could prove interesting. I actually came up with a character for another Infinities game which had the same premise.
I was trying to make an infinities version of a "legacy" character of mine, but got stuck deciding on a turning point.

As we had discussed earlier, your character could prove very interesting and fit well into this campaign. I hope I get some more interest. lol

Cool, well that bumps the number of interests up to three! Awesome! So I think I will leave it open just a tad longer just in case we get some others in here.
Next post will have some game-mech and limits in and I'll let everyone judge, critique, and fix things so this campaign will be great!

As far as the actual campaign goes for how characters can be thrown in...this is what I was thinking.
Classes could be anything, even though Jedi would need to be hidden in a sense, because even though this is a Infinity campaign, the Empire still has it's Sith leaders, similar to canon.
I was thinking of 30-40 point buy for characters, and starting characters at either 3 or 5, depending on what everyone would want to do. I want you guys to have a challenge and starting characters at such a mundane level of 1 would take a lot of fun out of it.
Either destiny or background could be used, but I need some debate as to which one would be better. I personally think it should be done with backgrounds, as to seemingly make things a little bit more smooth concerning your characters involvement with the Rebellion and the reason the Rebellion would want them anyway. Maybe your a freedom-fighter? Maybe your a mercenary who needed the credits to get out of the grip of one Jabba the Hutt (LOL). Really what I want is for some good flesh characters, because I promise, some of your canon characters will NOT be how you remember them, and you MAY be the actual hope for the Alliance.
Species as well can be anything. Again, combat will happen, but this is mostly to experiment with the concepts of who Starkiller could become given enough of an Infinity setting and seeing how much your character can either hinder his dominance and save the Rebellion, or fail trying and seeing the galaxy ruled by the Sith for a VERY LONG TIME. Who knows, maybe things will turn out different all together. So, if your still interested, I would like to get 4 people, or 6 at the most. So, still like the idea? If not, let's talk, I'm sure we can make it fun for everyone!

I suggested to Arcana my alternate ruling for BGs and Destiny, which he seemed to like.

> Instead of choosing a Destiny you will instead choose a Background. The Background will work as normal depending on whether Event, Occupation or Origin is chosen. Every odd level you will gain 1 Destiny point instead of 1 every level. Additionally, there are no longer any Destiny bonuses aside from those afforded by talents and other uses of Destiny Points. On occasion, the GM may see fit to award additional DPs for heroic actions or other exceptional deeds.

Sounds good to me.
I´d prefer to start at level 5 (of your choices). From my experience it is about as easy to provide a challenge no matter the level of the characters, but the higher level you´ve got, the more variety you can add to the challenges, because the characters will have a wider array of abilities to use to overcome them.
For point buy I´d just like to point out that there is quite a difference between 30 and 40 points. From my experience, around 30 gives more "normal" heroes, while 40 allows for some really powerful guys. Both have merit of course, but just so you´re aware of the differences.

The higher the level the better for me. I'm all for level 5.
DA is right about the point buy. With a 40 you can anticipate at least on average 2 17s and a few scores above 12. It makes for a rather high ability powered game. 32 or 36 has always been my favorite distrubution though 40 would be pretty cool too.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-06-25 14:04:41)

Frost used 40 for his Void Stalkers game, which made me have an array with 3 16´s, 2 14´s and one 10 at level 5. And this was for a human, without stat modifiers <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

## Re: (Reb) Infinities: Killer of the Stars

### **ArcanaFang** (2011-06-25 16:43:15)

Ok, well then as far as level goes I think we can all agree that level 5 should be pretty sufficient for me and everyone else.
And now that you guys showed me the stat line up in that way, I kinda think 36 would be better. I do want your characters to be pretty buff when it comes to challenges, but not so much that we get a whole bunch of 17's. Trust me, I believe the challenges won't be quite as easy as some of you might believe for your buff characters lol.

## Re: (Reb) Infinities: Killer of the Stars

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-06-25 18:09:15)

I certainly hope it won´t be easy, I just wanted to point out that if you don´t adjust for high point buys, a normal challenge for a certain level might be much simpler than expected. 40 is quite a bit above the book-expected 25, after all.
I´ve got two old concepts that could fit into this, as they´ve both been part in the birth of the Alliance. Which one I´ll be most likely to want to play here depends a bit on what kind of money we have available for starting gear, but also on what characters other people are considering.
I´d also like some more details about character creation, like HPs, hoserules, etc, but I suppose that´ll come in a casting call later.
