# GM's Please Read First

### **Alicia** (2010-11-02 17:35:11)

This section is dedicated to casting calls and Interest checks for ALL systems from the incarnations of Star Wars roleplaying games, Dungeons and Dragons to a homebrewn system.
If the system is not well known, it would be prudent to provide prospective players links to any useful material in the casting call.
It is recommended anyone looking to GM reads this topic:

[Game Master Tips for a Sucessful Play-by-Post Game](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=24174 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=24174")
All GM's looking to run a game are welcome to post a casting call or an interest check. It's requested the GM put an indication of which System and, if a Star Wars game, the Era the campaign is set in.
Doing so will make it easier for prospective players to have an idea on the setting of your campaign and make it easier to categorize at a later point.
Here's an example Casting Call title:

[SAGA OR] Growing Shadows
<span style="font-size: 1.00em;">Common System Abbreviations:</span>

**WEG** - Star Wars West End Games (d6)
**RCR** - Star Wars Revised Core Edition (d20 WOTC)
**SAGA**- Star Wars Saga Edition (d20 WOTC)
**D&D v**- Dungeons and Dragons (v will represent the version, ie 4e, 3.5)
**PATH**- Pathfinder
**M&M**- Mutants and Masterminds
<span style="font-size: 1.00em;">Era Abbreviations</span> This will be used in conjunction with the Star Wars abbreviation code.

**OR** - Old Republic
**RotE** - Rise of the Empire
**Reb** - Rebellion
**NR** - New Republic and New Jedi Order
**Leg**- Legacy

## Interest Checks vs Casting Calls

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Interest Checks vs Casting Calls</span> What is the difference?
**Casting Calls** is the formalization of the campaign generally including a full campaign briefing/introduction and lays out the ground rules for character creation (including house rules) while the **Interest check** is generally an initial post by GMs to see if there are even any interested parties for a campaign idea. Interest checks are a good way to gauge what sort of participation they will get before the GM actually sits down to create an entire campaign, which may not take root without such interested participants in the first place. An Interest check can ultimately be a time saving effort.
In many cases it becomes a fine line between the interest check and the casting call and it's now possible to just post one thread. I would like to point out that for a Casting Call to become official there must be an established set of character creation rules and a campaign introduction (please see the PBP tips section linked in the first post). So prospective players aren't having to search through posts, **ALL necessary and relevant information needed for a player to join *should be in the first post***.
