# [Saga ROTE] Dawn of Defiance - hosted on Roll20

### **Alicia** (2012-08-16 23:52:54)

I'm looking for a cast for anyone interested in trying out a developing Virtual Table top system called [Roll20](http://roll20.net "http://roll20.net").
The Campaign details can be found here: <!-- m -->[https://app.roll20.net/join/1733/KvC8HQ](https://app.roll20.net/join/1733/KvC8HQ "https://app.roll20.net/join/1733/KvC8HQ")<!-- m --> To access it you will be required to register on the site, but it's a quick and relatively painless process.

Hey,
I wanted to join up. I got my account and everything, but for some reason, the link you have isn't loading for me, even when I am logged in. Could be the computer I am on, though.

I took the group off the lfg listing. Let me pull you another link and we'll see if that works.
Look for a PM

I'm afraid this game hasn't run since before Christmas.
Keep your eye open for more castings!
