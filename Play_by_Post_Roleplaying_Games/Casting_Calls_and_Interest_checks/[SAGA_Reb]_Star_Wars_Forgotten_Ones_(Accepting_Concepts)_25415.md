**Game Type:** Hybrid (bi-weekly sessions using Roll20 with an emphasis of play over forum.)
**Session Time:** Saturdays 7pm EST for 3-4 hours
**Posting Requirement:** 2 - 3 times per week. More the better.

**Character Concepts** ~ March 30th
**Stat Blocks** ~ April 5 *(tentative)*

Been meddling with an idea where characters from different eras are brought together into the Rebellion Era, in a way which I haven't entirely decided on. I don't want to say too much right now as I don't want to ruin any surprises I come up with. If I were to settle on an Era characters would be from, it would be Clone Wars, but I'm open for the characters to be spread out through history converging on this one moment in time. I'll also allow one character to be from the Rebellion era if someone prefers it.
I want to primarily play through the forums with a bi-weekly 3-4 hour live session using either Roll20. Players will be expected to be able to post at least 2 or 3 times a week. In a perfect world, at least once/day. The more the better as it helps keeps a steady stream of interest.The VTT sessions would be required though I will make allowances for life happening. I'm thinking either Saturday night (7ish pm EST). These sessions would be text based, no mic or camera will be required.

A character concept will be required before you submit stats for a character. As I am always accepting concepts submitted concepts will be critiqued for compatibility with the current objective and other characters.
Characters will need a fairly comprehensive background and the concept should help narrow the headlines down. You won't need to come up with what your character was doing before he wakes up in the Rebellion Era, however if you have ideas then by all means.
You may submit as many character concepts fro review as you wish.
Please use this as a guideline in submitting the concept:

```
[b][size=150]Name[/size][/b]
Sex Race Age

[b]Brief Background:[/b]
[b]Past Adventures:[/b]
[b]Personality:[/b]
[b]You're Good at?..:[/b]
[b]What were you up to &#8230;[/b]
```

Please no stat blocks until a concept has been approved. You may, if you wish, include a list of abilities the character may have.
Once your concept has been approved, you may then refer to the Character Creation guidelines and House Rules available here <!-- s=> -->![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!-- s=> --> <!-- l -->[viewtopic.php?f=265&amp;t=25419](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=265&t=25419 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=265&t=25419")<!-- l -->

I'm really liking the idea of demo-specialist Clone Trooper #357 "Primes"
Depending on how far we get I want to go into Military Engineer Prestige class, and prolly start as a Soldier. I want him to be intelligent, with an interest in numbers as well as destruction...
Maybe I'll try watching the Clone Wars now that they have those lost episodes on Netflix for ideas.
And I hope that the grammar rules make allowances for how I like to informally type the word 'probably', among other quirks I can't think of right now.

I'm glad to see Primes is in the running - I really liked the idea when I saw it earlier. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->
As for my characters, I have a couple that would work equally well. There's the Iktotchi pilot who had a vision of his own death and the Human gunslinger whose best friend, a Gungan, was killed by droids on Naboo - both work with the Republic in different capacities. I've got decent backgrounds on each of those, and then there are the other sort of "fun" ideas that I always have kicking around. I'm not sure if I want to play a Force Sensitive or not just yet. I do believe I'll be able to commit to the timeframes though, especially if it's on Saturday nights.

Basically (physically), he's Hellboy in fatigues without the crazy hand and with the horns slightly altered. It was for a campaign I was invited to but which died after I applied.

Well that wonderful link from BWS2K should be enough for me to figure out the format and level a soldier at least to lvl 5.
And then I'll come up with some previous adventures. At least with a Clone Trooper the backstory is half done.

Don't focus on the number-crunching just yet, my young padawan, lest you stir our GM to wrath! I think I actually build characters backwards, if that's possible. Anyway. I absolutely love the concept of Primes already. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Personally I build a round about way, first I make a character concept. Than I try find rules that support the concept and than modify my character background depending on what mechanics I can use.

Decided today we're likely going to be using Roll20 over ORPG... While ORPG has some great benefits as far as private channels, I think with how infrequently we'll be playing having a better map system and not having to download a program for us to play overrides it.
As such I've made a campaign for us.
For right now I'm going to restrict access to it until I decide who is going to be in the cast, but here's the link in the event you'd like to keep an eye on it.

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-20 09:57:03)

The character that's catching my fancy at the moment is a **Shard** (p.78, *JATM*) who served for a time as an Iron Knight during the Arkanian Revolution (the debut of the Iron Knights in general - 60BBY). When Jedi Master Aquinos was exiled from the Jedi Order, taking most of the Iron Knights to Dweem and surviving the Jedi Purge as a result, my character would have chosen to stay abroad with his wife and daughters (yes, apparently, Shards have families) disguised as more ordinary droids (not the war droids of the Iron Knights, likely protocol droids or astromechs or those mouse droids - something less conspicuous) in order to better explore the galaxy. A pirate attack during their travels results in them being split up and sold off as jewelry, or ground down for such purposes, or hoarded, or other things pirates do with pretty crystals they find inside innocuous droids during a raid. My character would have eventually been set in a large amulet of some sort and wound up in the private collection of a Hutt. Regarding his Force Powers, I think something heavy with *farseeing*, *mind trick*, **Perfect Telepathy** (p.18, *JATM* - a Force Adept prestige class talent), **Visions** and **Force Perception** (p.101, *Corebook*) would be appropriate, though it depends on what level we start as (and maybe some GM-approved fudging of the rules). So this character would really be entering our campaign as a piece or jewelry, meaning he'd have to be worn or carried until he can find a suitable droid and be installed. How quickly that happens is up to the GM and can be something that doesn't take much time, or that takes a ton of time, it doesn't matter to me. His main motivation would be seeking out the remaining members of his family - his visions have him fairly confident that at least one of his daughters is still alive somewhere, though shrouded in the Dark Side. I don't think she would be Force Sensitive, though it might be cool if they had all served as Iron Knights together too, so maybe she is, or has grown into it since then.
Regarding the actual build... there's a lot of variables. First of all, his age is easily several hundred years old. Maybe even over a thousand, as the book states that they live for several millennium before natural erosion does them in. Personality-wise, he'd be a lot like you'd expect from one of the older FS species - pensive, slow to hasty action, but also intrigued by the galaxy and wanting to discover more of it. As an Iron Knight, he'd be a big anti-Dark Side/Empire but would probably be more interested in helping others to fight than actually take part in a direct, frontline assault. Even in the party, he's probably going to take more of a support role. The *mind trick* would be useful in this way. I have always been interested with the Shard and I'm sort of divided on how else I'd fill his Force Suite. I could go with **Mind Shard** and **Thought Bomb** and the like (p.28, *JATM*), which would add some offensive powers that are telepathically-based. Things like **Levitate** or **Move Object** would be interesting (*no more page references for you!*) because he could sort of move himself around, or others that are wearing him (maybe?). But then I'm partial to going with a droid-buster build with powers like **Drain Energy** and **Ionize**, which could be cool too. So it really depends on who else is in the party and what works best. **Force Track** would probably fit in a sense, but seems kind of weak to me.
Alternatively, I can play the Shard that I've always been most intrigued by. It would mean altering a lot of the above, but I'd probably start as jewelry anyway, since that's a really awesome way to end up trapped or whatever. The Iron Knights have these talents: **Force Repair** and **Heal Droid** (among others). I think it would be interesting to play a Shard doctor... for droids. Load up his Force Suite with healing-based powers and he could patch up your bleeding leg *and* your damaged motivator all at once! I dunno. I'm quirky like that. I'd still stick with some of the powers I listed above but the role would be more clearly as a medic than as a scout/mind-trick-er. Again, I haven't settled on anything yet, but I wanted to throw those ideas out there. If we end up with a Fallanassi (way cool) and a Clone Trooper (also way cool), then it's going to be an awesome game no matter what. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Weather today meant a delay, which turned into a Sick Day for me when my lovely wife got out of bed and collapsed on the couch and then went back to bed with a migraine. I have a forty minute commute to work a job where I make less than ten dollars an hour for a total of seven hours and gas costs $3.55/gal. It's not usually economically feasible for me to work on half days like this since most of my actual work is between 8:45 and 11:45 anyway.
I also wouldn't mind re-visiting [Jorax](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/blog.php?u=2810&b=39 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/blog.php?u=2810&b=39") either, if he ends up fitting better. <!-- s:r2: -->:<!-- s:r2: -->

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Clone Trooper CT-357 &quot;Primes&quot;:</span>**
Male Human 11
**Description:**
Primes has the appearance of a 22 year old human due the the accelerated growth rate of clones. He doesn't have a notable appearance because in the Grand Army of the Republic it's hard for a soldier to stand out. One has to make their presence known by actions. He has the standard armor of a Clone Commando, one of a highly skilled four person team used for complicated or delicate missions. He added orange-detailing and places to stow his tools on his armor, both holdovers from his previous job as a ordnance disposal technician.
**Brief Background:**
For the first ten years of a clone's life, they learn loyalty, discipline, and how to be an effective soldier from a combination of automated learning and a small cadre of Mandalorians. Not everyone clone makes it through the process. Those who do not show the standard qualities are viewed as "defective" and treated just like any other damaged product on an assembly line. Throughout his schooling, CT-357 skirted the edge.
In automated classes, Primes would pay more attention to the working of the console than the comparative battle tactics displayed on it. His curiosity drove him to pry at the edges of everything. On the way to classes, Primes would drop out of line to stop and bother Kaminoan technicians and clone masters with questions about what they were doing. He managed to meet standards, not knowing that his life depended on it. Then he ended up in a war, where his life depended on how well he and his brothers could use what they learned.
He served an uneventful few months in ordnance disposal but a critical mission put him in the limelight and qualified him for a nickname and a commando slot, even though it wasn't what he was bred for.
**Personality:**
Curiosity above all. Primes loves to learn, and likes to learn by deconstructing. He's torn apart much more than he's put back together and most of the things he has put together were intended to explode. He approaches skills, philosophy, and everything else the same way. This is why socializing with other people still remains a mystery to Primes, if you try to deconstruct someone's beliefs they usually react with hostility. And deconstructing people just leads to a mess. Getting along with other clones is easy, they all feel like brothers and everyone respects your skill however you contribute, but anyone else is alien and strange to Primes.
**You're Good at?..:**
Primes has a major in demolitions, with a minor in computers and droids. He likes to prepare a scenario as much as possible, preferably with explosives, and then use heavy weapons to finish the job as soon as possible. He likes to gain other kinds of knowledge, but his skill as a soldier has always come first. His later experiences with a commando time has taught him that sometimes more covert methods are needed, but he knows what he likes.
**Previous Adventures:**
Early Life
Primes got in lots of trouble during his initial training. He would take something apart and then take one of the components to the nearest Kaminoan Technician and ask about it's function. If it was recognized as something that shouldn't be in pieces, Primes would try to disappear in a crowd of clones with varying degrees of success. The most serious thing he did was unlock a whole classroom full of learning consoles to play any video the student chose, instead if the scheduled learning. All the students had a blast, looking at weapons demonstrations, staring wide-eyed at summaries of different alien species they had never seen before, and even tapping into local Kaminoan entertainment channels. CT-357 himself randomly found an advanced training demo for the commando program, detailing the uses of shaped charges and demolitions. When the authority figures showed up and demanded to know who had done this, each and every student insisted that they had done it. That was when CT-357 learned to trust his brothers.
The War
CT-357 was a sergeant of ordnance disposal squad, which mostly involved the boring and dangerous job of clearing mines to make way for large ground vehicles. Primes loved it though, he saved every piece of deactivated equipment he could, he struggled with a bulging pack every day on at least a half dozen different worlds. The event that catapulted him toward his destiny however was just around the corner.
On a dustball planet, covered in mesas, cliffs, and steep draws, the convoy of vehicles behind CT-357 caused the edge to give way, spilling his unit and a dozen vehicles to the earth below. As the surviving clones crawled from the overturned vehicles, they could see CIS dropships in the far distance, unloading what seemed to be an army of clankers. They were practically defenseless. CT-357 rummaged through his gathered junk and pulled out mine after mine, telling his squadmates to come out into the field and help him activate them before attack at nightfall. All those nights he spent modifying the mines' Friend/Foe Identification was going to pay off.
That bloody night, pinned down in the twisted fortifications of their vehicles, the clones desperately fought against overwhelming odds. "Fall Back! We have to pull them in closer!" CT-357 yelled. The droids closed in, the unthinking machines completely unsuspecting of what was obviously friendly CIS-deployed ordnance. "WHAT NOW?" one of his squadmates yelled, dragging himself into cover beside CT-357. "We're Dyin'! WHAT DO WE DO NOW?"
CT-357 looked around the edge of the smoking hulk of the ground transport they were behind, confirming the position of the enemy. "WE PRIME IT!" He yelled back, pressing his remote.
In the darkness, just visible through the muzzle flashes, the field lit up with the blinking lights of dozens of mines arming. The droids stopped firing. CT-357 stood up in the darkness and screamed, "ROGER ROGER THIS YOU CLANKING BASTARDS!"
In that flash and roar, Primes felt reborn.
**Tune in next time, when Primes gets attached to a commando unit and somehow ends up in the FUTURE.
***Hope you guys feel the swear was justified, I certainly do.

Gilliweed: Does he distrust Mandalorians and Sith for different reasons? Does he/did he have family or friends hurt in the war? Did he escape the genocide and then come back during the resettlement after the war?
For the fighting: Is it a martial arts style he learned off-planet?

Where was he born? Who are his friends? Family? Allies?
On what side did he particpate (Republic, Mando, freelance)? Was he perhaps enlisted by the mandos and forced to fight in their war?
Where did he learn to fight, his trade in mechanics?

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Tari</span>**
Male Shard (approximately 500 years old)
**Brief Background:** For the first several centuries of his life, Tari lived as all other Shards - immobile on Orax, growing and communing and meditating. When Jedi Master Aquinos formed the Iron Knights in 60BBY, he fought in the Arkanian Revolution like many others, though in more of a support role. His strengths in the Force lay in the healing arts and, combined with his heritage as a Shard, allowed for him to heal both the droid bodies of his battle-damaged kin and their fleshy allies. The Revolution actually saw a lot of carnage of both flesh and metal, with the dominant forces on the planet being cyborg constructs fighting one another. When Aquinos was exiled from the Order for teaching the ways of the Force to the Shard and fled with them to Dweem, Tari chose instead to live on Raxus Prime, the junk planet. He found purpose and contentment in using his healing abilities in the vast debris fields littered with damaged droids and wreckage. It was a dubious existence - serving those who would quickly dismember him for spare parts if given the chance.
Over time, he grew to have something of a local reputation as a sort of shaman among the simple-minded junk droid tribes that wandered the planet. Even the Jawa that had been transplanted to Raxus came to know of him by way of trading and occasional disputes. They quickly learned that he was more than salvage waiting to be claimed. All this was never his intention, of course - he was only interested in helping life to thrive where few would appreciate it, as Aquinos would have wanted. Too much attention could have been troublesome. Tari avoided the spaceports and other more civilized areas for fear that he might be noticed somehow, though he did have the opportunity to meet with Jedi Master Kazdan Paratus a number of times before realizing that the Aleena's once-strong and talented mind had been shattered by Order 66.
**Past Adventures:** While his time as an Iron Knight was more or less typcial of what one could expect as a combat medic, Tari's years on Raxus never seem to run short of curiosities. The wilderness of a planet virtually covered in centuries of scrap can prove to be the source of much adventure for a lone traveller or two. The warring tribes of junk droids all regard Tari as a mutual party, much like the Jedi of days past. In this capacity has he prevented many skirmishes or helped in what passes for diplomatic relations among the tribes. Some treat him as an equal, some seem to almost venerate him for his "mysterious powers". The Meeknu clan of Jawas that roam the planet know Tari as a shrewd trader and, in a rare display of character, have occasionally allowed him to repair a found droid rather than process it for their own purposes. Whether this was a kindness or just the result of having too much scrap already is mostly irrelevant.
**Personality:** Tari is a healer with compassion for all living things. This includes, in his view, droids of all makes and models. As such, and because of his Shard heritage, he is quite patient and attentive, preferring to watch and learn. When he does act, however, it is quick and with precision. At his best when restoring things to their proper working order, Tari's quirky, sometimes dry, sense of humor has served him well when bringing back those near death. He also has a keen interest in music, and has written a number of original compositions. For these reasons and more, he seems to inspire confidence in those around him in even the most dire situations.
**You're Good at?..:** Healing (or building) biological and mechanical allies, wielding the Living Force against the Dark Side - when not trying to escape its notice, and bringing out the best in those around him.
**What were you up to …** Tari recently decided to leave Raxus and go visit his brethren on Dweem. Serving with the Iron Knights had been an honor and several members of his Shard cluster-family fought alongside him. His dreams have been dark as of late, hinting at some impending danger related to them. It's not the first time he's traveled abroad and he's adept at passing for a typical droid, but the galaxy isn't as safe as it once was...
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

A couple notes: Clearly Tari (pronounced like *Atari* without the "A") would have some *vital transfers* in his suite, and the Iron Knight talents to support that (**Heal Droid** and **Force Repair**) and his life on the run (**Mask Presence**). Aside from that, probably a level or two of *Soldier* alongside *Jedi* to round him out. If we get up to the Prestige Class levels, he'd almost certainly go for a *Force Adept* with **Force Treatment**, though that may be a ways off. Feats like **Scavenger** and focusing on **Use the Force** and **Mechanics** in addition to **Treat Injury** would probably be a good choice. In terms of a droid body, he'd almost certainly prefer something inconspicuous and with the appendages and vocabulator so necessary to his usual habits. Enhanced sensors, high mobility, and stealth would be important as well.
Suggestions welcome! ![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)

Very nice. I like the background on Raxus. You and I would be quite a formidable mechanic team once I learn to think of you as a Jedi and not a droid.
Will your journey back tie into the transformation into jewelry?
I was thinking Primes would have something happen to him before or just after Order 66. So he could still be friendly to any party Jedi.
It would be a great reveal if he initially didn't recognize this new "Empire" until someone took off their helmet. (As I understand the original clones still made up part of the force for a while, especially the 501st).

> Will your journey back tie into the transformation into jewelry?

Good question. I think it would be best to leave that to the GM just because it's a choice I can't quite figure him making on purpose. Not in a real strong way I could play, anyhow. Better to just build him with a body, knowing that he's likely to lose it soon enough. I didn't mention Telepathy simply because I'm not sure I'll be able to grab those talents but it's an application of the UtF skill so it would still be a possibility. Maybe his transport gets attacked or something.

I agree. There's cool things you can do with time travel and that's just the sort of thing that would be awesome. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

> i&#39;m thinking of a character named Raven who was a child of Fallanassi and a Jedi master hiding from bounty hunters of the chaos that followed the Jedi Civil War. - Akisa

"*Why the choose to hide from the galaxy at large is unknown; they claim that they have seen the results of events caused by those that use the Force for their own personal gain and choose to not involve themselves in such incidents… That said, each generation of Fallanassi appoints one representative to wander the galaxy to determine the current state of affairs outside their own civilization and report back if any threat to their existence is present, so they can move yet again to preserve their way of life.*" (p.76, **Jedi Academy Training Manual**)
"*Why did your hero leave the Fallanassi to become an adventurer? Did you leave on your own, or were you exiled? How do you preserve the secrets of the Fallanassi, if at all? Are you looking for other Force-sensitive beings to train in the ways of the Fallanassi, or do you seek to accomplish some other goal before returning to your people?*" (p.77, **Jedi Academy Training Manual**)
There's certainly a lot of concern from a lot of folks about how the galaxy is recovering from the Jedi Civil War, I would think. It would make sense, then, that you would have been one of the scouts sent out to learn and then report back, or perhaps part of a tribe that was destroyed, leaving you on your own until you can contact another Fallanassi group. And then, of course, bounty hunters only make things more interesting. If you've only got that one sentence to work off of though, I would consider thinking about what happened to the parents and how they met in the first place. Usually the first thing you write down about a character is important to you for some reason, even if you don't realize it. A Jedi Master and a Fallanassi - there's potential for some good origin there for sure! <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
> Would a Cathar from the Mandalorian Wars who (due to the war) bears a strong distrust and distaste of both Mandalorians and Sith? He&#39;d specialize in fighting and mechanics. Any other ideas for him? -gilliweed

Fighting and mechancs... fits right in with the trooper who blows things up and the droid doctor, I suppose! I never noticed their speed - 8 squares. That's pretty neat. Off the top of my head, I'd think a scout might be interesting, with the "fighting" you mention being martial arts since they have those claws. I've always thought they were interesting as a species, but I think that's because I always liked Thundercats. Fighting and mechanics also hints at a pilot of some sort, which would be cool too. Pending GM approval, you could have a ship model that's thousands of years old cruising through Imperial territory. That'd be awesome. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

## Re: [SAGA Reb] Star Wars: Forgotten Ones

### **Akisa** (2014-03-25 17:47:55)

Sarna “Raven” Bell
Female Human 25
**Brief Background:**
Sarna also known as Raven is the child of Jason StarRunner a Jedi Master and Serini Bell a Fallanassi from a small group of Fallanassi on Lucazec. Jason was originally on a diplomatic mission that would’ve taken him pass the Lucazec system, but instead his ship suffered mechanic problems that caused his ship to crash land near a village where Serini Bell lived. Serini was able to save the only surviving member of the crash, an unconscious Jason StarRunner. At firs the Fallanassi circle wished to let Jason to perish to keep their order a secret, but Serini disobeyed the order and instead nursed Jason back to health falling in love with him in the process. While not thrilled by the survival of Jason, the Fallanassi circle forced Jason to server all communication with the order and remain under constant surveillance by members of the circle. While Serini never pushed her luck in getting married with Jason, she stayed with him eventually giving birth to Sarna.
It was quiet clear that once Sarna was born she was a force sensitive with the potential for some powerful raw ability, but there was debate on what training she should take. The argument was for Leylia to follow the ways of the Fallanassi Circle or receive training from her father which both sides were adamant determined for Sarna follow their individual training plan. After long discussions and debates it was agreed that Sarna was to be trained with the circle ideals with some minor training done by Jason. With the dual training Sarna learned a few of the secrets of both, but at the same time Sarna had a hard time warping her head over both philosophies combined.
**Past Adventures:**
When word of the Mandalorian Wars reached Lucazec the circle wondered what sort of threat the Mandalorian threat posed to the Fallanassi and asked for volunteers to scout the potential of the raiders, with Sarna being one of them. Although the Circle wanted each member to stay out of the war, but Sarna found she was unable to stay as a silent observer with so much suffering entered the war on the side of the Republic as commissioned pilot where she earned the call sign “Raven”. During the war it was discovered that Sarna who was now going by her call sign was force sensitive and had some force training managed to become an informal padawan of another Jedi in the war. Raven also participated in the battle of Malachor V, but was injured and became unconscious piror to the mass shadow generators were operated and sent to hospital ward and left behind when Revan and Malak took their fleet into the unknown.
Raven questioned if she should return home as she wondered what the consequence were for entering the war and so she informed the Fallanssi she would serve her commission until it ended to avoid drawing attention back to Lucazec with AWOL officer.
During the intermitted time between the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil war to reflect and calm her mind from the horrors she had witteness from the Mandalorian Wars trying to rid her of the dark taint the war brought. However just before her commission ended the Jedi Civil war went hot, Raven was forced to renter the war. This time Raven however stayed away from Jedi fearing that they could succumb to the Dark side more easily than other people in her eyes.
**Personality:**
Raven is cheerful woman despite some of the horrors and has a slight distrust of the Jedi, but know most mean well. As result she tries extra hard to hide her force sensitivity when she knows Jedi are around, but is willing to work with them.
**You're Good at?..:**
Raven is a skilled pilot (not the best but good), and with combination of her ability to stealth she was able to infiltrate behind enemy lines quiet easily.
**What were you up to …**
It eventually became known Raven was skilled force practitioner which further feared reprisals from the Fallanassi circle stayed away from home after the war as a self-imposed exile. And with the knowledge of Raven being a force sensitive with abilities similar to Jedi, most bounty hunters treated her as such hoping to collect, which drove Raven further into hiding.
**Description**
Raven is about 5’ 7” with a slim build. Raven tends to keep her hair long despite being in hiding (when asked it’s basically “it’s a F&*^ you to bounty hunters”), but occasionally lets her dye job lapse resulting in her black roots showing. Despite having good eyesight, Raven wares assorted eye glasses covering her hazel eyes. Raven tends to wear plain shirt and pants nothing flamboyant, but something more in common to the local fashion of the area.

## Re: [SAGA Reb] Star Wars: Forgotten Ones

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-27 21:09:32)

*(I'm re-submitting this build due to some new developments I came up with… <!– s:D –>![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!– s:D –> )*
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Tari</span>**
Male Shard (approximately 150 years old)
**Brief Background:** Like many Force-sensitive Shard, Tari joined up with Jedi Master Aqionos' Iron Knights in 60BBY. He was fitted for a FLTCH-Series droid body and put on the frontlines during the Arkanian Revolution but it quickly became apparent that his talents lay elsewhere. Because of his strong affinity for the healing arts and applications of the Living Force, and because the Iron Knights weren't afraid to take a beating, Tari was allowed to form the Paladins, a combat medic subdivision specifically tasked with patching up their battle-ready brethren as fast as possible. It was a small but necessary factor in the ultimate victory for the Republic Forces.
After Aquinos was exiled from the Order and fled to Dweem with most of the Iron Knights, Tari decided to have himself installed into a replica droid and travel the galaxy. He spent a decade or two learning all he could about the universe around him before settling in on Raxus Prime, the junk planet, in what would become Seperatist space. Thanks to the onset of the Clone Wars, there was no shortage of damaged droids and spare parts being dumped from low orbit on an almost daily basis. The wild junk droids that roamed the debris, eventually forming a primitive tribal society, came to treat Tari as something of a legend - a droid shaman to be feared, if not respected. The Shard was content with this, not wanting to bring too much attention to his true nature. During his time on Raxus Prime Tari was able to commune occasionally with Fallen Jedi Master Kazdan Paratus before his mind was totally shattered - an experience that proved bittersweet. He also gained a minor reputation with the Meeknu clan of Jawas that thrived amid the salvage and squalor who were always eager to cut a deal, and even managed to attract a few friends.
Patches and Scrubs, two DUM-Series pit droids, followed Tari everywhere, assisting with just about any endeavor - whether he asked for the help or not. Brutus, a junk droid of behemoth proportions, served as more of a bodyguard and loyal mount. His simple-mindedness was more than made up for his abilities in a fight. There were others, like KT-80 who was eventually taken off-planet to serve as part of an all-droid crew, and Servo, the lonely explorer of Raxus Prime, more interested in what lay below all the scrap than what went on above it. All in all, Tari rarely approached the more civilized space ports of industrial areas of the planet out of fear for discovery. He was adept at avoiding passive detection but too much scrutiny could lead to disaster.
**Past Adventures:** Aside from the day-to-day routine of searching for those in need of his talents, and the frequent territorial disputes to be solved as a trusted third party, Tari sometimes had the occasion to witness things that defied all but the most liberal logic. As far as the galaxy-at-large knew, droids were little better than walking datapads, useful for storing data and executing programmed functions but not terribly capable of free thought or self-determination. Not so. Even memory wipes, performed regularly everywhere else, were considered the most supreme violation of one's rights here on Raxus Prime. In fact, Tari met a number of very independent and quirky droids in his travels, perhaps the most interesting being Captain Steel - charismatic leader and captain of the Clockwork Pheonix, a ship crewed completely by droids and, to hear him tell it, quite capable in battle. Eccentric but indisputably answering to no one but himself, it was Captain Steel who wooed KT-80 to the stars, and adventures Tari could only guess at.
**Personality:** Compassionate, reserved, patient - these words describe Tari at any given moment. His calling is bringing victims back from the brink of death, and beyond, and he pursues that calling with an intensity most could only dream of. His first training was as a soldier inside a war droid though, and it comes through in battle. Like a true healer, he appreciates living things as the sum of complex parts and systems, pulsing in the Force and worthy of being. And, like a true warrior, he's all the more dangerous for it.
**You're Good at?..:** Healing, leading, repairing, negotiating, hiding/avoiding detection, keeping calm under pressure
**What were you up to …** Tari and his small band of droids were traveling through the Chemical Wastes - an area of Raxus known for its giant toxic cesspools and corrosive gas clouds - when they were suddenly ambushed by a number of particularly treacherous junk droids. The battle was over in only a few moments, with Tari's shell being disabled and his crystal Shard body eventually violentally extracted and tossed aside, it, too, becoming damaged in the encounter. His last memories are of Brutus fighting at least a dozen of the attackers, only to be cut down in a hail of blaster fire while the pit droids huddled close nearby. They, too, would almost certainly be dismantled for spare parts - if there were any left when the droids were finished here.
**Physical Description:** Tari's Shard body is a large red crystal, now chipped and missing the last few centimeters of its full length because of the recent attack. When in his human replica droid shell, it was fitted in the center of the chest, above the sternum, and appeared as little more than eccentric body modification. His eyes were colored to match the crystal and his dark hair kept at a wild shoulder length; beard full. He walked with the air of authority, a battle-hardened veteran who's seen much of what war offers, but with an unexpected measure of compassion in his voice. Tari wore robes based on the Paladin's colors: Black and deep crimson with gold accents. Beneath these were assorted belts, pouches, and satchels of tools and other necessities.

It depends on how often we level-up. CL6 allows for some lovely combinations, but I know my build would appreciate at least three talents. That's doable with a **Soldier 1/Jedi 5**. I might try and have fun with **Noble** as well. Prestige Classes begin (mostly) at CL7, which means Primes is just short of his *Elite Trooper* but it's something to work towards. Are you allowing starting wealth/equipment or do we start naked?

Most prestiges start at 8, as you need 7 heroic levels before you can get a prestige as exampled on page 206 with the scout going into Bounty Hunter.
I'm anticipating a level every 2-3 live sessions. Assuming of course a good pace is also kept on the forums.
If you haven't noticed yet. I've actually created our game forum and set up the regulations thread, which I believe I'm done adjusting.

On the other hand, I'm also pretty new to the system so level seven or six would let me get a grasp on a vanilla character before the Prestige Classes make everything even more complicated.
EDIT: My thinking is It seems like Elite Trooper has WAY more content spread out in the books than Military Engineer. Good for min/maxing, not so good for me.

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-30 16:37:50)

For those unfamiliar with Saga Character Creation, I've typed up a quick cheat sheet. I'm willing to bet there's at least one error but Alicia will spot it pronto and let us all know. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

First, I make a list of all the blanks I'm going to need to fill in, like so:
LEVEL ONE
Defense Bonuses (I always forget these!)
Bonus Feat (any, on Table 3-1, and don't forget that Humans get an extra one to start!)
Class Feats (these come with your first class for free)
Talent
LEVEL TWO
Bonus Class Feat
LEVEL THREE
Talent
2nd Bonus Feat (any, you get this according to table 3-1)
LEVEL FOUR
Bonus Class Feat
Ability Increases (you get two, Table 3-1)
LEVEL FIVE
Talent
LEVEL SIX
Bonus Feat (any, Table 3-1)
Bonus Class Feat
Then I go back and fill them in, neglecting all the tedious other number-ish things until later. That's if I'm staying in *one* class. Multi-classing means something *slightly* different. Let's say I'm going with three levels of Jedi and three levels of Soldier. I'll do it like this:
LEVEL ONE (Jedi 1)
[everything like before]
LEVEL TWO (Jedi 2)
[everything like before]
LEVEL THREE (Jedi 3)
[everything like before]
LEVEL FOUR (Jedi 3/Soldier 1)
Class Feat (you pick *only one* from the starting feats for the new class, so maybe I go with Light Armor Proficiency)
Ability Increases (because these happen at CL4 no matter what)
Talent (from the *new* class, in this case Soldier)
LEVEL FIVE (Jedi 3/Soldier 2)
Bonus Class Feat (in this case, from the Soldier choices, because we've advanced to a level *two* Soldier and we're looking at Table 3-6)
LEVEL SIX (Jedi 3/Soldier 3)
Bonus Feat (any, from Table 3-1)
Talent (from the new class, in this case Soldier)
It's a little tricky the first couple times but you'll develop your own methods. Likely, they'll look nothing like mine because I'm usually wrong in some way whenever I try and help people, and because I always seem to do things the hard way. Hopefully, though, it helps a little. I crunch all the numbers after I've settled on the feats and talents since it's really just math at that point. I *always* save math for last.
Don't forget there are some House Rules in play too, like the **Athletics** skill and the way we're using **Backgrounds** and **Destiny Points**.

</details>

**EDIT:** Yep. If/when you multi-class, you get to take the better of the defense bonuses. So if your class has a +1 to Will and the new class has a +2, you take the +2 instead. I think.

## Re: [SAGA Reb] Star Wars: Forgotten Ones

### **Ryder2101** (2014-03-31 19:27:31)

So Alicia clued me in on this game, here is my concept:
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">BCAD-344</span>**
Male, Battle Droid, Millennia+
**Brief Background:**
Designed and built during the reign of the Infinite Empire. Designated as a Battlefield Combat Analyst Droid, assigned role of overseer on remote world prior to Force Plague affecting the Rakata. Oversaw and maintained slave encampment population until the rebellions began throught the Empire. Though better armed and equipped the Empire forces were outnumbered 5 to 1 and were quickly pushed into a corner, a planetary mountain range, where they made their last stand. 344 retreated into a bunker and supply depot built into the mountain after recieving heavy damage from a previous battle in an attempt to repair and command the last of the Empire forces. During the last battle explosions on the mountain creatrd a rock slide that buried the depot and trapped the occupants inside. 344 was one of a handful of droids and Rakata caught inside. Unable to communicate past the rubble and with incomplete repairs his power core drained until he permanetly shut down.
The depot was discovered many years later by a salvage team and in their excitement attempted to make repairs to 344 and some of the other droids they found, unfortunately when they powered them up they all attacked in unison. Though most were beyond full functionality their built in weapons still managed to function and betwen surprise and close proximity they were dispatched quickly but not before two of the other droids overheated and melted down their power cores, another's weapon exploded in it's mount permanently disabling it, and 344 took a hit to the jury rigged repairs and began loosing power once again. In his last moments of "consciousness" he felt stunned as a complication occured in his programming. He "felt" that what he had done was wrong, which conflicted against his base programming, this was not within his original programming parameters and created a paradoxal loop as the last of power drained from his core and everything went dark again.
**Past Adventures:**
None. Activated on Rakata controled slave colony, operated for a few years before revolt caused his long slumber.
**Personality:**
Inquisitive, Philisophical. Questions the morality of actions. Quiet and contemplative but violent and agressive when pressed.
**You're Good at?..:**
Mechanics, Firing Rifles and Heavy Weapons, Intimidation
**What were you up to …**
Contemplating the meaning of existence in his semi-permanment deactivation

**Raven's Story**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Brief Background:**
Sarna also known as Raven is the child of Jason StarRunner a Jedi Master and Serini Bell a Fallanassi from a small group of Fallanassi on Lucazec. Jason was originally on a diplomatic mission that would’ve taken him pass the Lucazec system, but instead his ship suffered mechanic problems that caused his ship to crash land near a village where Serini Bell lived. Serini was able to save the only surviving member of the crash, an unconscious Jason StarRunner. At firs the Fallanassi circle wished to let Jason to perish to keep their order a secret, but Serini disobeyed the order and instead nursed Jason back to health falling in love with him in the process. While not thrilled by the survival of Jason, the Fallanassi circle forced Jason to server all communication with the order and remain under constant surveillance by members of the circle. While Serini never pushed her luck in getting married with Jason, she stayed with him eventually giving birth to Sarna.
It was quiet clear that once Sarna was born she was a force sensitive with the potential for some powerful raw ability, but there was debate on what training she should take. The argument was for Leylia to follow the ways of the Fallanassi Circle or receive training from her father which both sides were adamant determined for Sarna follow their individual training plan. After long discussions and debates it was agreed that Sarna was to be trained with the circle ideals with some minor training done by Jason. With the dual training Sarna learned a few of the secrets of both, but at the same time Sarna had a hard time warping her head over both philosophies combined.
**Past Adventures:**
When word of the Mandalorian Wars reached Lucazec the circle wondered what sort of threat the Mandalorian threat posed to the Fallanassi and asked for volunteers to scout the potential of the raiders, with Sarna being one of them. Although the Circle wanted each member to stay out of the war, but Sarna found she was unable to stay as a silent observer with so much suffering entered the war on the side of the Republic as commissioned pilot where she earned the call sign “Raven”. During the war it was discovered that Sarna who was now going by her call sign was force sensitive and had some force training managed to become an informal padawan of another Jedi in the war. During her service in the war of pilot of drop ship for infiltration group, started to pick up Mando'a through various missions, and self study to make her task easier when behind enemy lines. Raven also participated in the battle of Malachor V, but was injured and became unconscious piror to the mass shadow generators were operated and sent to hospital ward and left behind when Revan and Malak took their fleet into the unknown.
Raven questioned if she should return home as she wondered what the consequence were for entering the war and so she informed the Fallanssi she would serve her commission until it ended to avoid drawing attention back to Lucazec with AWOL officer.
During the intermitted time between the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil war to reflect and calm her mind from the horrors she had witteness from the Mandalorian Wars trying to rid her of the dark taint the war brought. However just before her commission ended the Jedi Civil war went hot, Raven was forced to renter the war. This time Raven however stayed away from Jedi fearing that they could succumb to the Dark side more easily than other people in her eyes.
**Personality:**
Raven is cheerful woman despite some of the horrors and has a slight distrust of the Jedi, but know most mean well. As result she tries extra hard to hide her force sensitivity when she knows Jedi are around, but is willing to work with them.
**You're Good at?..:**
Raven is a skilled pilot (not the best but good), and with combination of her ability to stealth she was able to infiltrate behind enemy lines quiet easily.
**What were you up to …**
It eventually became known Raven was skilled force practitioner which further feared reprisals from the Fallanassi circle stayed away from home after the war as a self-imposed exile. And with the knowledge of Raven being a force sensitive with abilities similar to Jedi, most bounty hunters treated her as such hoping to collect, which drove Raven further into hiding.
**Description**
Raven is about 5’ 7” with a slim build. Raven tends to keep her hair long despite being in hiding (when asked it’s basically “it’s a F&*^ you to bounty hunters”), but occasionally lets her dye job lapse resulting in her black roots showing. Despite having good eyesight, Raven wares assorted eye glasses covering her hazel eyes. Raven tends to wear plain shirt and pants nothing flamboyant, but something more in common to the local fashion of the area.

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Designed and built by Rakata forces during the reign of the Infinite Empire this droid was originally designated as a Battlefield Combat Analyst Droid. Programmed to assist battlefield commanders in field tactics or be capable of overseeing small operations independently the model saw little battlefield deployment, instead many were assigned to remote outposts to keep slave populations under control. When the Rakata fell ill to the Force Plague and the Empire began to fall apart, revolts and rebellions sprang up across the galaxy.
BCAD-344 was one of the few left in service on a remote world when the enslaved population rebelled against the Infinite Empire and over threw their captors. After weeks of fighting and heavy losses the planet's remaining forces were pushed into a corner. 344 having had taken heavy damage and his shield generator unrepairable had retreated to a supply depot that was now mostly empty and organized a last stand in hopes of out maneuvering the slaves with better tactics against their larger numbers. Unfortunately during this last battle several explosions from misguided rockets created a rock slide above the depot which essentially buried it under several hundred metric tons of rubble. 344 was effectively cut off from the remaining Rakata Forces, mainly battle droids, and too damaged to self repair his internal power supply slowly ran out.
BCAD-344 laid dormant inside the buried supply depot for an untold amount of years before being discovered by a salvage team following old stories of battles past. Having dug out an path to the depot they entered finding most in ruin, and structurally unsound. When they discovered 344 in a state of heavy disrepair they thought of the credits they would make from the find if it could be made operational again. They quickly attempted repairs so that they could power it up and affixed a restraining bolt but were surprised when the bolt did not restrain 344 as it opened fire on the trio with a concealed pulse-wave blaster in its right arm. Between surprise and the close range 344 dispatched the three then froze over their bodies with what seemed an eternity to him.
He found himself confused, his programming instructed him to kill and maintain control of slave populations but he felt ashamed, guilty, of what he had just done. Was it a fault in his programming caused by damage to his processor or memory core or was it the unknown amount of years he had been dormant, he did not know. His functionality only at 70% he gathered the needed tools and attempted further repairs on himself well into the next day before realizing that he again was unable to repair the damage to his power systems and began shutting down to preserve his memory core.

**BCAD** looks good, though I'm intrigued about what would happen if you were asked for your weapons license and it was a jillion years old. And what's a Droid Feat datacard - is that a House Rule or something? **Raven** looks pretty rad too. I love that picture for **Primes** - very atmospheric. I've had a bit of a crazy week but I'll have Tari up, I think, by the end of the day. Wicked pumped for the game. Cheers!

We were joking about the weapons licenses yesterday actually.
The data card was for the feat reprogramming he did since he had to buy the information.
Speaking of Ryder that would likely be the property of the Infinite Empire and not in your inventory. Sorry to rain on that parade.

Also, worthy of a double-post, I am considering Tari's role in the party and his personality in general. I think I'm gonna play him a little crazy, but he's definitely going to be relegated to patching ya'll up. He'll make a lovely healthcare provider as long as you keep him from getting shot in the face.

Ryder and Akisa: your sheets are ready to be transferred to the Cast List thread. Best way to do this is edit you post here in this thread and copy and paste it to a new post in the game's Cast list thread.
I have Raven's intro done as of right now. So once you've transferred your sheet I'll get you underway.

### **Jake** (2014-04-07 05:35:32)

And as for the immediate events that put Primes out of commission:
The next morning on the surface, CT-357 and the few survivors from that night's battle were evacuated by gunship. The squad talked about the battle while a group of ARC troopers sharing the transport sat in the rear quietly, not fraternizing with the common soldiers.
When they landed at the nearest Command Post with orbital transports, CT-357 gathered up his squad to unload gear and report to remaining battalion elements. "You hold on just a minute, Sargent." came a voice from behind him, somehow gruffer than a usual clone's speech. The rest of Primes' squad turned to look at what was going on. "No, you squaddies keep moving, you already have your orders."
CT-357 knew that ARC troopers were different from most clones, but he had no idea how different. They all had names for one thing. The captain of their team introduced himself as 'Tabs' and the other two troopers under his command called themselves 'Shims' and 'Hardy'. They explained that they had lost their demolitions expert in action on the surface and that their mission was to 'disable' a hidden facility on the planet. "As a matter of fact," Tabs said, "Your unit happened to stumble pretty close to it, that's why there were so many enemy soldiers there." He sat down in one of the seats and motioned for CT-357 to do the same. "Hardy over there thinks you're still a shiny*, but I heard your guys talking and I've got a feeling you lost some polish last night." He motioned to Shims and Hardy and they dropped a packed field ruck in CT-357's lap. "Anyway, it's my call and you're getting 'voluntold' to get attached to our team on a probationary status for an indefinite period. And the good news doesn't stop there because I came up with the perfect new designation for you... Primes." *derogative term for clone soldiers fresh from Kamino.
Primes served on that team from then on, up until a mission right near Order 66. They had never worked closely with Jedi before, and ARC troopers were infamous for telling Jedi Generals exactly what they thought of their 'battle plans' and 'tactical experience'. The team had a taciturn Jedi with them, a female Kel Dor named 'Tuun Lat', for a stealth mission to a orbital Seperatist facility suspected of producing Commando Droids with Clone Trooper facades with additional rumors of horrifying experiments such as robotic parasites and droid infiltrators. They had a stasis tube on board for a scientist they were meant to capture, and a mission to 'disable' the rest of the facility. Primes shuddered. "Spare me the details, Captain, let's just disable the hell out of it."
Just as they got off the surface, Captain Tabs got the word for Order 66. Shims and Hardy got the transmission as well and looked on in concern as Captain Tabs seemed to argue over his comlink. "That can't be right! Check again!" He yelled into the comlink, standing up. The Jedi piloting their craft looked back at this, still silent but unaware of the transmission. "We have to, sir." Shims said, standing up. Hardy stood up too, silently making his intentions known as well.
Primes was in the back prepping equipment with his helmet, and integrated comlink, sitting up in the passenger section with the team. "Source this transmission, Primes! I think that the Seperatists are up to some sort of freakiness." Then the Captain suddenly stopped his furious pacing. "What the hell do you mean, acceptable losses?" Tabs tore off his helmet, face pale. "Check the sensors, Jedi!" He stomped up towards the cockpit. Shims and Hardy ran after him with different intentions for the Jedi. Tuun Lat turned back towards the clones, finally realizing some of them had murderous intentions. "Stand down, you two. Those orders can't be right." Tabs said, turning to face Shims and Hardy. They had already unslung their weapons. Tuun Lat stepped out in front of the captain, her green lightsaber springing to life.
Primes was at the terminal when he heard that hum. He had seen holos, he'd heard it before, he knew what it meant, and he had to stop it. In the time it took for him to grab a rifle and head up there the fight had already ended. Hardy and Tabs were on the ground, possibly dead and Shims bent over to pick something up. "We shot her, but the Jedi traitor has fled. Tabs is a traitor as well and paid the price. Help me find her. Now." Primes was aghast, "What are you talking about Shims? What did you do to Captain Tabs?" He rushed past Shims to get to the Captain's limp form when he heard a hum and felt a fire in his belly. Primes looked and saw the green beam skewering his torso, held by Shims. "Traitor it is. Then die by the Jedi traitor's weapon!" Shims pulled the beam back and Primes fell to his knees.
Primes saw his assailant raise the blade again to cut him down, but it was pulled from his hand. Shims turned to take a lazy, grazing blow all the way up from the bottom of his torso. Primes fell the rest of the way to the ground, but was pulled up into a sitting position by the kneeling Tuun Lat. "You're... hurt." Primes gasped. "We need to contact the listening post." Tuun Lat shook her head. "They've already fired torpedoes from the surface. It is not likely we will survive. Make your peace." Then the ship was hit.
(That's the first I've heard her talk.) Primes thought in a absent-minded way as everything faded to black. (She's got a pretty voice.)
In a half-awake state of blood loss, Primes was dragged to the stasis pod by the mortally wounded Tuun Lat as the ship quickly started to depressurize from multiple hull breaches. That part of the job done, Tuun Lat crawled back to the cockpit and told the computer to eject all compromised systems, including life support. "Power should run to the stasis pod for a while." She said, before pulling off her normal Kel Dorian rebreather and goggles, and shutting her eyes.
*So the gist is his team leader either didn't believe or was trying to disobey Order 66 when it happened, so after the two "loyal" team members failed to kill their officer and the Jedi with them the other clones blew up the ship ensure the Jedi's demise. The intel they had about the facility was flat-out misinformation spread by Seperatists. Primes is under the impression that some sinister Seperatist experiment, plot or technology was in play and he'll stay pretty freaked out about the idea of robotic parasites and replicants and such for a long time from now. That way he was in that stasis tube for however long the story needs. He doesn't necessarily remember immediately that he was saved by Tuun Lat.
EDIT: Changed to reflect needs of the story. Now with more lightsabers!

Hey there people, I was looking this over, and it seems quite interesting. I also took a quick look through the game forum, and it seems like the story hasn´t progressed so far either. Plus, I saw this wasn´t labeled as closed either, which usually means there is a spot or two open. And if there is...well, do I really need to explain where I am going with this?
I had a character in mind that I think both Alicia and BW might recognize, but I figured I´d take this chance to make a new iteration of the concept, bringing him even closer to the vision I had for him.

### **Alicia** (2014-04-13 11:28:22)

First of all, DA. Welcome Back!
Second. I have all the players I'm looking for right now, but feel free to submit your concept.

## Re: [SAGA Reb] Star Wars: Forgotten Ones (Accepting Concepts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-04-13 11:49:47)

Thanks. I hope I can contribute something to the site again. I´ll sit down and work a little bit on the concept then.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-04-16 06:59:28)

Here is a brief summary of my concept, Alicia and BW might have more memories of him as well. It´s a concept I´ve enjoyed playing in the past, and hopes to play again. If I get a reason to put some more time on it, you´ll see the background section grow even bigger than before. As a side note, I think he´d fit in pretty well with the current group, and also pretty well with the setting established.
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Yuri Carkov</span>**
Male Human, 27 (and then almost four millennia, I guess)
**Brief Background:** Born into high nobility on Taris, though he spent far more time sneaking into the lower levels and hanging with the swoop gangs. Was eventually found and taken for Jedi training and eventually became the padawan of Zez-Kai Ell, a member of the Jedi Council. Followed the Jedi Crusaders to war against the Mandalorians, but did not follow Revan and Malak into unknown space and fought against them as a mercenary and eventually as a Jedi again when they returned. During the Dark Wars, he travelled as a bounty hunter and mercenary, investigating the remnants of the Sith and offering his aid wherever it was needed.
**Past Adventures:** Fought in both the Mandalorian Wars and the Civil War. Minor experiences as a bounty hunter and mercenary. Participated in the efforts to destroy the Force Harvester.
**Personality:** Social and outgoing, Yuri has also been scarred by war. He holds himself to a strict philosophy and moral code, following his own path and beliefs. Even though he was born into it himself, he holds a level of contempt for typical members of high society who considers themselves to be above others.
**You're Good at?..:** Years of Jedi training and fighting has made Yuri an exceptional swordsman, practising multiple forms of lightsaber combat, including the aggressive Juyo. He is also a skilled investigator and infiltrator. In the years after the great purge he became very skilled at hiding his true identity as a Jedi as well.
**What were you up to …** I though I´d leave this blank, as I have a feeling it would depend a bit on the circumstances causing him to appear in the campaign.

Greetings DA! Yes, I recall Yuri... I thought you were going to submit Surge. <!-- s8/ -->![8/](https://i.ibb.co/kVxpy8vX/icon-eek.gif)<!-- s8/ -->

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-04-17 02:10:24)

Nah, for this campaign it seems more interesting to have a character that is a bit out of time and place.

Ah Yuri.... Not sure when I'll have a spot open up, but I'll let you know.
