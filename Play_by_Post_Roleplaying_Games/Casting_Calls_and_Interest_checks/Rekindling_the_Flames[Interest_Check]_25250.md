# Rekindling the Flames[Interest Check]

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-27 02:47:54)

OK, so with a few new members coming in (most likely looking for games), and because I have thought about it for a while, I´ll be doing a re-launch of my old campaign "Flames of War". Or, well, it´s pretty much the general idea that remains the same, most other things have changed. Anyway, I thought I´d look up the interest before I write down a real casting call, and I´d also like prospective players to have some input on things.
The campaign takes place in the Old Republic era, and starts in 3,963, the same year the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders began their full-scale invasion into Republic space. I have plans for this to be a long running campaign, taking you through the Mandalorian Wars and into the Jedi Civil War, and perhaps even beyond that. All this depends on the players of course, but I personally see this as quite an interesting time period to adventure in. Despite its name, the will not be anything overly military about the campaign, it will feature a style more like the KOTOR and TOR games, and pretty much any kind of character is viable. I would prefer that this at least starts out as a classic "heroic" game, though I will not outright ban more dark-aligned characters, and as the campaign progresses, you will hopefully be morally challenged more than once, and perhaps even end up switching sides.
The would be pretty much it for a summary, though a casting call will contain a little more details about exactly where to start out and so on. When I ran this before, I started at level 1, but I´ve decided to move things up a few notches this time around. I´ve been thinking about level 5-8 as starters, but would like some input on this. My intention is that at the end of the campaign (assuming you get there), your characters will be well into the double-digit levels, just to give you a hint of the scale I had in mind.

I think that I would be interested in playing in this.

Great, I was hoping to get a minimum of 2-3 interested players before I get into setting things up

I'm not playing in anything at the moment, and would thoroughly appreciate the distraction from reality.

Great then, I´d like to have at least one more before we begin organize things, but you can always start thinking about concepts and post any questions you have.

I have interest. SInce the "Fell Star" is on indefinite hold, I'd like to get into a game.
Perhaps a force user but not a Jedi? Human...
What else you want here? And... How many does that make for your decision point?
