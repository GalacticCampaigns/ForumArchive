# RSS Entropy

### **Tempeste** (2010-02-27 10:06:20)

Over 500 years before the Rise of the Empire, the Republic is at peace and the minds of it's inhabitants are focused on science and exploration. Vast science complexes labour across dozens of worlds in an attempt to make the next great discovery. The Republic has funded it's own such science and exploration project. Coruscant is the home of their project, and their latest creation, The RSS Entropy is soon to leave on it's first voyage. It's crew will be the first to graduate from the newly created Naval Academy on the planet, and their success could herald a great many discoveries. Engineers, Scientists, Soldiers and Diplomats all find work on the ship as well as any Jedi Advisors who see fit to aid the effort.
This game is probably going to be focused more on using skill and roleplaying than a standard game. That isn't to say there won't be any combat but it won't play as large a role overall. The Naval Academy trains prospective officers in their desried roles, and once finished training they gain the Rank of Ensign, with the chance of being promoted at the discretion of their superiors, in many cases this is the Captain.
Starting Level: 1
Species and Classes: Only species which are present in the galaxy at this time may be chosen, which basically means no Ewoks or Chiss. All classes can be chosen, though if you are a Jedi then you'll likely be an Apprentice who is acting as an advisor alongside your Master.
Starting Credits: Maximum for your class, this represents personal belongings whilst other items may be provided later depending on your position. You may only buy equipment suitable for the time perior, if you're unsure then let me know.
Hit Points: 1/2+1 of your class maximum.
Point Buy: 32
Sourcebooks: TOTG, S&V, SOTG, CWCG, GAW, JATM, KOTOR, TFU.
Players: I'm looking for 4-5 players.
Character: Your character needs to have skills that make them suitable to serve on such a ship. They could be a scientist, Engineer, Tactical Officer, Ambassador/Diplomat, Advisor or a higher ranking Officer. You will form part of the Bridge crew.

Coolness I get to make that Tech I have wanted to play. Yes!!!

Heh, I has a scientist. Possibly the most useless character possible in most Star Wars games <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
edit: Hmm.. wonder if I should work more on my Saga Edition Star Trek conversion...

### **Anonymous** (2010-03-01 18:27:29)

I could see a tactical officer/ security officer. Kinda Worf-y. I'll try to have a build posted soon.

### **Anonymous** (2010-03-01 22:34:46)

So, I'm assuming the Taung are not allowed (being extinct, I think) during this time. Or, perchance, did a small community of them survive? Please?

---

### **Tempeste** (2010-03-02 07:53:40)

Well You could be a Taung but you'd have to have a good reason for it. Like being cloned from mere scraps of genetic material or something.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-02 09:34:38)

Hmm, I´m feeling torn on this. I originally wanted to be something like a Jedi Scholar, but that concept works best for higher-level characters, as do pretty much of my other concepts which are not too combat related.
I´ve got a sudden urge to create some sort of prototype science/slicer/medic droid though, but ever since I got my hands on the Scavenger´s Guide, it seems that any desire to build a droid without it is just too limited.
So, I guess what I´m asking is if I could use a few stuff from in there? I can send you the necessary info.

### **Tempeste** (2010-03-02 09:53:32)

If you tell me what everything means then sure. I am planning on getting that book sooner or later due to it being pretty cheap compared to the others.

Great, I´ll get to it.

### **zenkatarn** (2010-03-02 10:09:41)

Too bad there are no salarians in the Star Wars universe. This game needs a Mordin. :P Still, I may try to come up with a trigger-happy biologist. Maybe a Cerean? Hm...I'll think about it.

EDIT: Actually, after looking through the KotOR book briefly, I think I may play a Khil scientist of some sort. I'll have the character some time today or tomorrow.

Millennium ago, during the height of the Dark Wars, the Mandlorians worked hand in hand with the Sith. Je'Karta fought alongside his brothers against the Republic, not out of a hatred for the Republic so much as a desire to prove himself against worthy foes. As the only way to find worthy opponents was to march into war, Je'Karta suited up and marched in with the other front-liners. Soon, it was realized that the young Taung had a knack for seeing the enemy's battle plans and working around them. Pulling him from the front lines, his commanders put him to work learning the art of war, battle planning, and strategy. It was a grand time for Je'Karta.
All of that came to an end, however, when a Sith Lord decided to use Je'Karta's platoon as part of his experiments. Betraying the entire group, the Sith locked them in carbonite, sealing them up for years at a time, only thawing them out to experiment on them. Je'Karta never knew about the experiments first hand, though, as something happened to the Sith to prevent his experiments from continuing. He never even knew what they were about.
A few years ago, thousands of years after the Dark Wars were over, Je'Karta was found by a Republic exploration ship. Recovery took some time and the Taung learned that he was the last known of his kind in the universe. Realizing that the war with the Republic was over, and more importantly that the Sith had betrayed Mandalorian trust, Je'Karta swore vengeance against the Sith cults. He also joined the Republic navy, hoping that exploring the unknown regions of the galaxy might turn up a settlement of Taung that had survived extinction. Outside of that, Je'Karta continues to work with the Republic, explaining that he owes them for his release.
At least until the other Taung are found.

Background works, and the destiny should tie quite nicely into the game. Nice job.

Thank you, sir. I was hoping that he might discover a small colony of Taungs still alive.

Well, here´s my application. With zen taking the role of the healer, I figured to cut that part of the original concept, and be able to specialize a bit more on other tasks. It worked out pretty well, and this guy can probably be helpful with pretty much anything, both on and off the ship, but especially on board as a systems operator/engineer. I´ll compose a PM for you Tempeste with all the stuff I pulled from the Scavenger´s Guide.
I wasn´t sure on how to handle mounting a Tool Kit on an appendage, but I just got inspired by the stats for R2 and dedicated a few appendages to it.

**Model Information**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The ACE-1 (Auxiliary Companion Engine, 1st model), is a droid manufactured by the Czerka Corporation to be an advanced assistant droid on starships across the Galaxy. Its primary functioning is systems operations and mechanics, but its heuristic processor and advanced adaption routines allows it to engage in nearly any task imaginable, thus making it a versatile companion for virtually any kind of starship crew. In addition to its advanced locomotion systems, vast information databases, and sensory equipment, the ACE-1 also has a short-range pulse blaster built into its frame, as a self-defense mechanism.

</details>

**Appearance** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Unlike most astromech droids, the ACE-1 has been given a quite humanoid and friendly appearance, like most Czerka-manufactured droids. It has a small frame, about 1,5 meters high, four legs, and one arm featuring a magnetized claw. Below each of its four legs is installed a set of wheels, allowing the droid to move quite rapidly across smooth surfaces. The droid also features a second arm, which in turn contain several extendable tools useable to perform virtually any kind of mechanic or computer related task. A third arm can also be extended from the chassis as needed, containing the droids internal blaster.
Constructed to be extremely flexible, the ACE-1 can twist and twirl most of its limbs an appendages around pretty much as it pleases. This gives the droid the capacity to remain upright in pretty much any situation, as well as alter its structural configuration to fit into enclosed spaces and find hiding places pretty much anywhere.

Ok, did you have any background in mind for it or is the droid going to be a new build who's just been assigned to the ship?

### **zenkatarn** (2010-03-06 12:37:55)

Sorry I've taken so long. Been playing Mass Effect 2 for the second time. I'm sure you know how that is, Temp. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Meldar is a rather unusual representative of his species. While most Khil prefer diplomacy and peaceful solutions to problems, Meldar has never been afraid to "do what is necessary" in his eyes. It doesn't hurt that he really enjoys shooting things, either.
He originally entered the Navel Academy with the idea of being a soldier in mind. However, when he was first deployed in the field, he realized his talents might be more useful elsewhere. He became a field medic, and found himself enjoying saving people's lives even more than he enjoyed taking them. There was a certain challenge involved in healing that appealed to Meldar. He became very interested in biology and other sciences as well, and began to further his studies. When he was offered a position on the *Entropy*, he jumped at the change to study the galaxy.

Not the most exciting background ever, but we can't all have been in the Salarian Special Tasks Group. :P

No, I was thinking this was a brand new droid model, assigned to the ship. Suits pretty well in the whole "1st level character, unique droid build" concept I think.

### **Tempeste** (2010-03-07 07:33:48)

I'll leave this open for another day or two I think, then get around to starting things. You may want to at least detail your droids personality and any quirks DA, if only to give me an idea of how it'll act.

Tempeste hasn't been on the forum since June/july. If you want character critique your best bet is to post it in the player's corner forum not in a dead casting call.

Howdy Liluca, and welcome to the site. Alicia is right in this case, if you check the post dates in upper right hand corner of the post you'll notice this is a long dead casting. There are others that are open though, if you look around a bit. Good signs are recent posts and the game in question being up and running like the Arena and Glories of the Empire, both of which are accepting applicants. If you want critiques and help adjusting to PBP, Alicia's suggestion is superb. Drop a line in the [Introduce Yourself](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=2 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=2") forum and stop by the chat room some time. Good luck and happy gaming!
