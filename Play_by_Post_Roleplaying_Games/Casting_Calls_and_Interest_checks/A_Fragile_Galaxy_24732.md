# A Fragile Galaxy

### **Tempeste** (2010-06-30 15:46:27)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">**A FRAGILE GALAXY**</span>
It has been some 15 years since the end of the **Clone Wars** and the rise of the **Empire**
The galaxy is ruled through the iron fist of **Emperor Palpatine**
Dissenters and Resistance fighters form a minor annoyance to Imperial Forces
The true threat lingers in the darkness, away from the gaze of the **Emperor** and his spies
On the edges of Imperial space a lone tramp freighter travels between the stars
It's crew and passengers unaware of the events about to transpire
The **Unintended** would soon arrive at it's destination of **Tatooine**
Yet a **predator** stalks its prey and prepares to unleash a new power upon the Galaxy
A fragile Galaxy is a pbp Campaign set a few years before the events of A New Hope. As far as canon is concerned, all time up until the game starts is as usual, afterwards anything can happen. The characters will be on this tramp freighter for one reason or another, they could be a pilot, engineer or just someone who's paid for passage. I'm not interested in statblocks at the moment, I'm going to borrow an idea from Sketchpad and just ask that interested users instead submit a number of concepts (up to 5) using the template below. Despite this being the dark times I am likely to accept force using characters and I do hope for a wide range of characters to be submitted. Lost Jedi, Imperial Stormtroopers, Rebel Insurgents, Kleptomaniac Droids.. Anything.
I'll leave this open until a week on friday, after which I'll close it, select around 5 characters and then request the full character stats +background.

Re;
Signature Gear: If your character doesn't have a signature item then leave this blank. For defining aspect I'd like you to just try and sum the character up by whatever it is that makes them stand out from the crowd, be it a force user, imperial spy etc. Any questions, feel free to post or find me in chat.
Thanks for reading.

any motion on this?

---

### **Tempeste** (2010-07-09 09:58:51)

I was going to close the casting call today but I was hoping for at least 4 characters. I'll leave it open for a few more days and then see how it goes from there.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-07-09 12:39:31)

Oh, I´d completely forgot about this. I´ll be putting something up.

### **Tempeste** (2010-07-12 05:58:14)

OK this is closed now. The Characters will be;
KG-97
Ty'Ilandria Di-Inaris
Kol Kanot
William Brenner
As far as character creation goes;
Level 1, 32 point buy, Max credits and 1/2+1 hp for each level after first. You can use CWCG, SOTG, TFUCG, S&V, KOTOR, GAW, JATM, RECG. If you want to use another book let me know and I'll look into it. Once characters are posted i'll get the forum sorted out and we can get started.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-07-12 09:45:28)

I was hoping I could use the stats for the Mandalorian Combat Suit (KOTOR 201) for my armor, but it has no cost listed. I wasn´t thinking an authentic Mandalorian armor, but rather that one had been acquired and used as a template for a new suit that would use its base stats + some template and upgrades.
I´d happily receive it for free if that was why you asked for our characters "Signature Gear", though I could probably pay a bit for it as well. 5-6k sounds like a fair price to me, but that´s your call.

---

### **Tempeste** (2010-07-12 10:18:00)

Well I don't have any intention of giving you the armour for free. I think the best choice would be to have it be elsewhere for the begining of the campaign, and he can be reuinited with it at a later point. I say this as I think it would be pretty powerful to have from the start. And if it isn't authentic mando armour anyway, maybe someting like an Armoured Flightsuit would be a better choice, unless something a bit heavier was wanted.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-07-12 11:23:04)

The problem is that doesn´t fit very well with the concept. The character´s supposed to be an employee of SoroSuub Corp who has turned Bounty Hunter to "field test" new technology, especially a new set of armor meant for marketing primarily to private contractors such as bounty hunters and specialized mercs. So having him not have the armor from scratch makes little sense.
The reason I´d like to use that particular armor isn´t because of the stats, which are pretty poor, but the capacity for upgrading it. It doesn´t have to be Mandalorian at all, that has no bearing on the character, but that is the only armor with those good stats, plus Mandalorian technology is known for being flexible and adjustable. And there exists no such flexible armor from newer era books, thus it makes some sense that someone would try to develop something equally flexible.
If a cost had been listed, I´d be using that one, but since one isn´t, it´s pretty much up to you.

### **Tempeste** (2010-07-14 08:16:45)

I'd expect common sense to be used, the armour doesn't have a cost because it can't be bought or sold. It's only available to actual mandalorian soldiers during the KOTOR setting. I'd ask that you find another piece of armour to use, or wait and have a better suit of armour (Maybe one of the medium/lights from S&V) later on at a point that makes sense.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-07-14 10:02:48)

Funny because my common sense tells me there´s a very high possibility that at least one suit of armor could have survived from the Mandalorian Wars and into present date, or that a Mandalorian armorsmith could be hired as a consultant by a team of researchers. And I say it again, for my concept there is no "better" armor.
But I´ll use something else, most likely the Light Powered Armor from KOTOR.

Battle droids are designed for combat, incorporating systems to improve their dexterity.
Like other droids, battle droids have no Constitution score.
Size : Battle droids are typically of Medium size, gaining no bonuses or penalties for the ir size.
Speed: Battle droids have a base speed of 6 squares and use walking locomotion.
Droid Traits: Battle droids are fourth - degree droids and have all droid
immunities and typical droid t raits (see pages 187-188 of the Saga Edition
core rulebook).
Bonus Equipment: Battle droids are constructed with the following droid
systems installed in each : walking locomotion, plasteel shell (+2 armor)'
basic processor, internal comlink, locked access, 2 hand appendages, and
vocabulator.
A BATTLE DROID
Bonus Feats: At 1st level, a battle droid can select one Armor Proficiency
feat and one Weapon Proficiency feat for which it meets the prerequisites.
Automatic Languages: Basic and Binary.
Traits: Czerka droid designs are exceptionally personable, no matter their
degree or designed purpose. Even the feared HK assassin droids have a certain
frightening charm. A Czerka droid can use its Intelligence or Wisdom modifier
instead of its Charisma modifier to determine its Persuasion skill modifier.
Nonliving: A droid is immune to poison, disease, radiation, noncorrosive
atmospheric hazards, vacuum, mind-affecting effects, stunning effects, and
any other effect that works only on living targets. Droids have no connection
to the Force and can't gain the Force Sensitivity feat or learn Force powers.
Droids do not have a Constitution score, so they don't get bonus hit points
for having a high Constitution, and they apply their Strength modifier to
their Fortitude Defense.
