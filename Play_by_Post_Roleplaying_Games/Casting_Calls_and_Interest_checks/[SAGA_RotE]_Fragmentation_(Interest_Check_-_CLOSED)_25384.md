# [SAGA RotE] Fragmentation (Interest Check - CLOSED)

### **BWS2K** (2013-08-20 16:00:28)

I ran a series of solo games a while back (called *[Reality Bytes](http://www.galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=13 "http://www.galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=13")* in the game histories), with a very general sense of how they would weave together and form a cohesive plot. What we ended up with was something entirely different, though not altogether bad, and I really enjoyed the experience. I'd be interested in doing the same thing again and, like last time, I would merely ask for a droid or droid-themed character (mechanic, cybernetically-enhanced, etc.) and a personal goal or two. I think we spent a week or two in the IC bantering over starting level and gear and such and I think it really helped things work as well as they did - so feel free to do that here.
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;"><div style="text-align: center;">
**Interest Check will close at midnight, August 24, 2013.**
</div>

</span>**
**Specifics**

* Characters do *not* have to be droids but *must* be droid/mechanically-themed. Examples would include (but are not limited to) mechanics, technicians, slicers, cybernetically-enhanced soldiers, or a member of the Shard species (p.79, JATM).
* This will take place during the *Rise of the Empire* era, starting a few years before Alderaan gets Deathstarred (4BBY), though whether or not that has much significance in our game depends on player/character choices. I just think it's a really exciting time to play in, even if we never see a stormtrooper.
* I like to keep it loose as far as post-frequency, and since it'll be a number of solo threads initially, I'll ask for at least one post a week. Faster is certainly possible, but if I don't hear from a player after a week I might have to arrange for a self-destructâ€¦
* Combat is likely but not the focus of the campaign, so don't worry about keeping track of individual shots (exceptions to be discussed if necessary, i.e. rockets). Instead, if a natural **1** is rolled as an Attack Roll this represents the weapon being empty, jamming, or otherwise requiring re-loading.
* Please provide references for non-core material.
* Please provide a level breakdown of your build in a spoiler when submitting a character.
* I'm going to open for *three* player slots, to start solo at first and then possibly join up later. If the player wants to stay solo, that's fine too.

**Character Guidelines**

* 5th-level, any class, 36pts (droids use 34pts and can't be Force Sensitive, naturally).
* Standard Destiny Point rules. Be as creative as you like!
* You can use *Scavengers' Guide to Droids* for chassis creation rules if you like, but Chapter 11 of the Corebook is fine.
* Maximum starting wealth from your first class (for whatever you want) *plus* 2000 credits. I don't require that you have the *Tech Specialist* feat in order to purchase upgrades like Enhanced Dexterity, but there are pricing rules that I *will* enforce (i.e. "*one-tenth the cost of the item/droid to be modified or 1000 credits, whichever is more*").
* Starting systems don't count towards encumbrance, but do keep track of that for later.
* Droid quirks (p.18, *Scav's Guide*) are not required, but encouraged.
* I will allow Force Sensitive (non-droid) characters, but remember the setting - this is a year *after* Order 66, and all that implies.

I'm open to any questions/comments/bribes about most of the above, so have at it!

I knew you'd say that. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> Well we've already covered her story though, so I feel like you should do someone new...? Or at least an alternate multi-verse version of her. Gimme whatchya got and we'll see what we come up with.

Called it. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->
Drexler was higher than level five I think, so be prepared to re-invent him a bit. I'll leave the IC open until this weekend, and then if it's just you two we'll start something up.

Hello there, I'm new here but have always enjoyed playing droids in Saga. I have a lot of different ideas that I can throw out. I have everything from combat droids, 4th and 5th degree, to astromechs who are convinced they are being chased by Jawa slavers. Just let me know how many ideas I can throw out at once. <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->

It might be helpful if you guys give me a quick update on your current situation. Jason - whatchyabeenupto? Nadia - did you go with Steel or Karn or what? I've been trying to be patient all week, but the wheels are definitely turning about cool things for you guys to do. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Krieg... are you... are you a Time Lord...? I posted my post and then I got the notification that you posted, but I didn't see it before - and you posted yesterday... only the internet didn't tell me that... and the last post I saw was Alicia's...
But yeah. We're probably going to be best friends now, if the first sentence I ever read from you says "*always enjoyed playing droids in Saga.*" You can throw all of those ideas out, or none, or your favorite, or what have you. And you'd be slot numero three, so you win!

Ah. Well then, allow myself to introduce myself.
Krieg - just tell me who you want to play, and maybe if you have any requests about what you want him/her/it to do, and I'll take it from there. I'm pretty sandboxy, and I've enjoyed it. Sometimes I get carried away with my NPCs and sometimes I rage quit for a week or so, but if you look through the histories you'll see where the both Marina and Jason (and then Nadia) had some good times. Plus, you'll probably get to meet Captain Steel (in *passing* Alicia, don't get worked up about it... <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> ) who's pretty much the coolest ever.
Seriously. He's awesome.

Not a time lord, just an escaped Hyperion experiment. Okay after looking at all my little friends I picked one. Hope you don't mind but I'm using google drive cause a buddy of mine gave me this easy way to organize my characters, he also told me about this site. =^_^=

That looks pretty cool. I'll percolate one some ideas and throw them out, but do you have any specific requests? Would Z1 work with organics, or take a job from them, if it meant pay or fame?

## Re: [SAGA RotE] Fragmentation (Interest Check)

### **Krieg** (2013-08-24 00:06:45)

He's willing to have them pay him, even work with them. Z1 just doesn't trust them.

I'm waiting for the forum to get approved and I'll have a post up nearly immediately for Z1 (it's just waiting to be posted). Nadia and Jason will be forthcoming, as soon as I have another chunk of time to think on them and hear back about what they've been up to recently (we haven't heard from Jason for fifteen years, for instance - what are he and Sera up to?).
