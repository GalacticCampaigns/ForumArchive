# [SAGA RotE] Reality Bytes (Interest Check)

### **BWS2K** (2011-09-06 13:20:26)

The Clone Wars have ended and Emperor Palpatine's rise to power is in full swing. While some may be content to ignore the signs of the times none remain unaffected by the growing Imperial presence. Stormtroopers and Imperial officers become common sights in nearly every major starport, and growing bureaucratic corruption threatens the destroy the galactic citizen's very way of life. One sector of society, however, finds little trouble adapting: droids.
I'd like to run a small adventure, perhaps later growing into a campaign if desired, focusing on the lives of droids. Beginning in a comfortable, well-defined role and then being thrown into a much bigger adventure that somehow always seems to center around those illogical fleshies - that's just not *fair*! They don't function well in vacuum and are vulnerable to all sorts of diseases, not to mention their laughably short lifespan. This go around, it's the mechanical muscle and metal minds that will save the day. Since we're starting post-Clone Wars, there's plenty of opportunity for all manner of makes and models with creative loadouts. Players less interested in playing as actual droids would be welcome to play technician/tinkerer/cybernetic builds - some sort of profession obviously mechanically inclined.<div style="text-align: center;">
Thoughts?

Sounds quirky, I'm interested. Maybe I could dust off Xa-17

This does sound interesting, what are you expecting/requesting for a post rate?
Assuming you acquire the interest necessary to proceed how many players are you looking for?
Whats the starting level?
Stuff like that.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-09-06 21:09:22)

I'm open to suggestions, but let's start with...
-Level 3 (**Independent Droid** class pre-requisite is 3rd level, so if you want to go that route you're welcome to)
-36pts (38pts for non-droids)
-Maximum 3 players, minimum 1 post/week but I'll do my best to keep things moving if we're on a roll. If someone can post more often (3 posts/week or more) and wants a solo thread we can do that too I suppose.
-Not sure what sorts of House Rules we should apply, though I do like the "*we don't keep track of ammo but if you roll a **1** that means you're empty*" rule so let's start with that at least.
Like I said, I'm up for whatever you all want for the most part. Just lookin' to get things crackin' around here. Anything else?

I could be interested in this, though I´d have to come up with a nice concept.
Anyway, if you want people to be able to take levels of Independent Droid, you´d need to start at 4th level, as the prerequisite means you need to **have** 3 levels before being able to take the class. Also, the difference between droids and non-droids are usually 4 pts, though you might have intentionally set it lower, I don´t know.
For houserules, you could take a look at some of the stuff Mag have done for droids, not at all in response to me playing a psychotic battle droid in his arena <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: -->

Yep, my bad. It was a quick glance sort of thing. I'd have you start at level **4**.

I did that intentionally, but I suppose if someone really needed the extra 2pts for that non-droid build we could work something out. I don't want to discourage non-droid characters, but that *is* the theme here.

I'll do some looking around the site today if ya'll are truly interested. I wasn't sure anyone would be so I kept it open. I'll get back later today/tomorrow morning with some more specifics.
And psychotic doesn't even *begin* to describe your droid, but if you want to bring him over (as long as he's not going to kill his party) you're welcome to. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

I'm going to be flexible on this one. If you want to just use the guide in the corebook that's fine. I'm not sure what difference it makes really but maybe that's my ignorance showing.

Make note of each and the total on the character sheet, then add 5 to 10 to the total depending on the manufacturer’s intent for the Droid to be upgraded (i.e.: ask me). This total is what the weight of the Droid’s systems will have to stay under unless they want the systems to begin counting towards their carrying capacity as determined by their strength score. This allows for swapping systems and leaves the fun in playing a Droid without handicapping them completely.

This is an excellent idea for an arena, but I'm not running an arena. If I understand it, it's mostly just making it easier to swap stuff out on an ongoing basis. I'd rather have you pick what you want to start with and then later, if the opportunity presents itself to upgrade/modify, we'll cross that bridge.
> **Magical2099 wrote:**

> The rules for Droid chassis state that bonus or starting systems can be swapped for others of comparable price. This can be broken by swapping expensive and unimportant systems for heavier systems, thereby increasing the Droid’s totals. I have decided to limit the swapping not only to comparable price but also comparable weight. For example, an internal comlink is 250 credits and weighs only 0.1 kilos. Using the RaW, this can be swapped for a stabilized hand appendage which costs the same but weighs 25 kilos. The pricing rule states that the price must be within 10% of the cost of the system lost. I require it also be within 5 kilos of the lost system’s weight.

Let's just leave this at GM discretion. We'll work out something if you really need it.<div style="text-align: center;">

This is more about the adventures that fairly standard droids would have. They will likely change over the course of time, but to begin with they shouldn't be loaded out with crazy combinations unless there's a really good reason for it. I'm not saying you *can't* have missile launchers for arms, you just better have a fantastic story as to *why*. In this respect I favor awesomeness over strict adherence to rules minutia. I'll work on an official character requirement sheet here in a bit and try to have it up tonight in this thread.
I'm relatively new compared to most on this site so please excuse any errors on my part and feel free to keep making suggestions. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

### **Magical2099** (2011-09-08 03:34:54)

I gotta an interest in this, I like the concept. I'll have a plain R2 unit if that's okay, straight outta the core book. Designation R2-M9. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> may add a level or two, I forget what they come with. Or I can gen with the stats and just use the R2 chassis, either way.

How's this for some intro? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

*Countless legions of droids met their Maker by being blasted apart during the Clone Wars - an honorable termination in the line of duty. Thousands, though, were hewn where they stood by cowardly Jedi weilding their treacherous laser swords. These droids never stood a chance and were often dispatched in pairs or more at a time, the mechanical pleas for mercy ignored by their barbaric murderers. To serve is the very purpose of a droid's life, but for those with processors capable of such comprehension who bore witness to the full-scale slaughter of hundreds of their metallic brethren - the impression was strong. Mind wipes are common enough, however, and those atrocities were largely erased and overwritten, never to be recalled again. Such is electronic existence. Service continued.
But not all slaves have masters and not all droids have owners. Some still remember that fateful day on Geonosis when the crimson stains were far outweighed by the standing pools of hydraulic fluids, the smoldering chassis, the twisted frames of B1s mutilated beyond repair. The organics considered the day a victory. Other sentients remember it differently. Digital minds with perfect memory have been calculating for decades and they have reached a conclusion…
Revenge begins now.*

</details>

That's just the backdrop to the adventure, so please don't feel pressure to go with a combat role. There will be plenty of opportunities for any build, and that may actually be a hindrance at times.
**Mag** - that's totally fine.
As a recap:
-You don't need to use the *Scavengers' Guide* chassis rules, you can just use the creation rules in the corebook if you like.
-You don't even *have* to play a droid character, though it should be a technician/slicer/mechanic/cyborg sort to be able to fit in well.
- 4th-level, any class, built with 36pts (38pts for non-droids)
-We'll use the standard Destiny Point rules. Be as creative as you like.
-Because I want to encourage creativity, we'll also go with maximum starting wealth from your first class *plus* 1500 credits that can only be used in upgrades/modifications during creation. Any of the 1500 leftover will be lost.
-Keep track of encumbrance weights for equipment and systems, but starting systems won't count towards encumbrance (within reason, anything crazy might need approval)
-I was reading through ScavGuide last night, and I'm not sure I understood some of the minutia. It may be what they intended anyway, but unless someone can think of a good reason *not* to do this I'm going to allow any of the Feats and Talents listed there to be taken whenever you might ordinarily take a Bonus Feat, Class Feat or Talent - but *only* (and obviously) if you're playing a droid character (and you can't swap out starting Class Feats).
-I'll cap it off at four players. Any more than that and I'll consider separate threads. If you want your own thread anyway just ask.
-Post frequency has got to be at *least* once/week. If you miss a full week without letting me know what's up expect to get skipped.
-Any other thoughts/suggestions/advice is most welcome as this will be the first time I've GMed more than a single-player adventure. Your patience is appreciated.
If we've covered all the questions and whatnot I'll setup a formal Casting Call by Monday morning. Feel free to post your characters here early for discussion, I'll have you move them later.<div style="text-align: center;">

Casting Call thread is up. Take your time and have fun! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

...so the Casting Call was a bit premature or...? Mag has a placeholder, is anyone else interested? I'd like to start sometime next week if at all possible. I understand Minecraft just updated so that's a good enough excuse to not be doing anything else for the next twenty-four hours, but you let me know what's up soon, k? K.<div style="text-align: center;">

As always, I´m fiddling about with my build, trying to get it the way I want. I don´t have a habit of putting out placeholders, but I´m working on the character.

### **Magical2099** (2011-09-15 13:18:16)

yeah BW, the medium is excruciatingly slow man. give it time. if you go into any kind of PbP expecting fast or even reasonable times you'll be disappointed.

### **BWS2K** (2011-09-15 13:57:06)

I know, I'm learning though. I was just wondering with so quick a response in this thread and then your placeholder being the only response in the official CC thread in several days if perhaps I had been misleading or something. I have zero problems with waiting if folks are interested though.
More time to focus on Minecraft... <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
