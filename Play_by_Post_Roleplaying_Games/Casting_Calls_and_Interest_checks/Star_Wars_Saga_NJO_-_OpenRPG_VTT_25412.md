Posting this on behalf of my GM who is looking for some able-minds to join my Mandalorian Bounty Hunter and a Chiss Jedi in training.
Game is set during the New Jedi Order few years before the Vong Wars (timeline wise).
We play Mondays around 8 EST on OpenRPG.
GM can be reached on Skype: Mithran_Nova
