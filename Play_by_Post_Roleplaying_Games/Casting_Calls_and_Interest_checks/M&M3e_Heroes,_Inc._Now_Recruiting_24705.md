### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-09-23 20:01:13)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Misfit**</span>
**Concept:** Carefree, seemingly unreliable and unresponsible guy, looks like he is just out to have fun
**Powers:** A wide variety of tricks, often focused around mundane items granted special powers. Also born with a seemingly high sense of luck, although sometimes it seems to fail him, creating rather awkward moments.
**Why Are You a Hero?** To be honest, it was this or going to jail. People seemingly have a thing for supervillains, even minor ones like me, and a bunch of other heroes suggested I switch sides or I would just find more trouble. At the moment, it was pretty much just survival instinct, though I started to appreciate living on the right side of the law.
**Why Are You Interested in Heroes, Inc.?** Truth be told, I was recommended to go here, probably so they´d have someone to keep an eye on me. But still, it seems like there could be some fun here, and seemingly the other guys won´t be too stiff.
**List One Past Adventure:** Heh, I´ve done a few things, though nothing much major. Biggest thing was probably that time I got busted. Me and some pals were going to break in to a laboratory and snag some things for the boss, but a couple of those hero fellows were waiting for us. I did my best, but they were a little more trouble than I had anticipated. Though still, they were four on one, and apparently they were good at this whole crime fighting thing, and that´s when I wound up in custody.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-09-23 20:15:56)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Allanon/Timaeus**</span>
**Concept:** Ancient magician who harbors the spirit of the ancient dragon, Timaeus
**Powers:** Magic powers, primarily mental and sensory in nature. Also gains a lot of advantages from his fusion with the dragons spirit, and can occasionally also assume its shape.
**Why Are You a Hero?** Well, it seemed like a good thing to do for someone with my abilities, and also matches well with the protective nature of Timaeus.
**Why Are You Interested in Heroes, Inc.?** They seems like a modern-day interpretation (in a way) of the old order of guardian mages that I belonged to. Plus, they can hopefully give me some chance to adopt to this modern world a bit better.
**List One Past Adventure:** I guess the grandest tale I have to offer was my initiation ritual, which accidentially was also where I met Timaeus. You see, all acolytes meant to be raised into truly joining the order must pass a challenge, individually tailored to suit them, which also serves the purpose of summoning forth the spirit of an ancient creature that will serve as their guide and protector.
For me, the test was one of battle. I had never been much for action, pretty much preferred to study and learn instead of fighting. I guess I should have seen the trial coming. It was really an onslaught, they just dropped me in a large cave, and then sent forth summoned spirits to attack me. At first, the test was rather easy, as the spirits were receptive to my mind magics, and I could even end the battles without causing undue injury, though it grew tougher. They started to send constructs at me, mindless golem I could not influence in any way.
We are all taught some manners of self-defense, both magical and mundane, though I was pretty much at a huge disadvantage. And that´s when it happened. I felt something burn in my forehead, and suddenly a silhouette of a dragon appeared, and I heard a roar inside my head. And then everything just went completely chaotic, and I started to grow, my hands grew claws, my body scales, and a bloody tail came out my rear. That was the first time I merged with Timaeus, and it wasn´t very hard ridding myself of those creatures after that. Suffice to say, I passed my trials, and was awarded with the title of druid of the frist order, as it seemed a creature of great strength and reputation had chosen me.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-09-25 10:04:45)

**Name:** Red Arrow
**Concept:** Untested second-generation hero taking over his father's legacy.
**Powers:** Energy Controller (wields a mysterious form of apparently kinetic energy called "aggro").
**Why Are You a Hero?**
Well really, what else would I be? I've inherited these powers from my dad, and as far as I can tell my mum's not exactly normal either. I've never known a normal life in any case, so it's not like I'd rather live one. I have to admit, I figured I'd be a different superhero to my dad, maybe get to work alongside him... But when life gives you lemons, right?
**Why Are You Interested in Heroes, Inc.?**
You see, for practically his entire career dad worked as part of a team. First with QUEST, then with WARD. I'm taking over as Red Arrow but they know I'm not the *same* Red Arrow, and they won't just accept me in his place. I think my dad wants to fasttrack me through the experience-gaining part so I can properly take over his legacy, be an asset to Red Arrow's reputation rather than destroy it (I mean, how will it look to the public if Red Arrow suddenly and without warning is cut out from all his previous affiliations. My dad even has knighthoods and medals, for heaven's sake!). Don't get me wrong, I want that experience too. That's why I'm here. And I want you to consider me for my strengths, not just as a favour to my father. So by all means test my abilities if you like, I'm pretty confident I won't disappoint.
**List One Past Adventure:**
Back in England there's this gang, the "Punk Pack". They've all got minor superpowers, and they're stuck back in the Seventies, studded leather jackets, safety pin piercings, that's sort of thing. They even name themselves after punk bands, can you believe that? Pistol, Damned, Clash, Strangler, and Roundhouse.
Well, they gatecrashed a benefit event on a boat out on the Thames. Stole the charity money and all the guest's valuables. I was flying overhead at the time, and saw the police chase, figured I could help. When Clash ripped up the road and sent a police car hurtling into a storefront, I knew I had to step in.
I was outnumbered, and they had the tactical advantage in a face-on fight even if they are all idiots. The fact is though, that I had the element of surprise on my side. I was down on the road in front of them before they knew it, and used my aggro to flip their car. I knocked them out with a burst of aggro, which held them until the police showed. I had to get out of there then, at the time I was a vigilante...
I was lucky that time, the Punk Pack aren't too clever and easily beaten if you get the drop on them, any English hero can tell you that... But villains aren't always that easy. That's why I need allies in the field - to be part of a team.

### **Magical2099** (2010-09-29 03:00:30)

**Name** Nathan Judge "The Walker" "Nightmare's Chains"
**Concept:** Tortured insomniac who summons his nightmares to do battle while wielding a magical chain. Darker hero who's yet to find anything scarier than the things that stalk him in his sleep.
**Powers:** Summons his nightmares to torment evildoers, wields a magical chain that he can summon at will, has powers similar to Ghost Rider's chain.
**Why Are You a Hero?** Not much choice. With strange abilities like his, he can be a villain or a hero and he knows far too much about fear to enjoy giving it to innocents. He hopes one day to find a way to rid himself of his nightmares, even if it means losing his powers.
**Why Are You Interested in Heroes, Inc.?** He hopes that through the group's popularity and PR to find a way to cure his nightmares.
**List One Past Adventure:** He had just been thrown out of another hotel for his screaming in his sleep when he found himself walking through the rougher side of town. As he walked he thought of how to generate the income necessary to rent one of those nice places with good soundproofing. *Heh, I'll be the only one there without bad intentions. Hell, I'll probably get thrown out for roughing up the regulars now that I think about it.*
He rounds another corner at random, having no destination in mind and knowing most of the city by heart from his ample late night wanderings. A small boy runs from the apartment building just up the block, running so hard he slams into the walker.
**"Careful son, what are you running from?"** the walker asks.
As the boy looks up the walker can see the abject terror in his face as he screams to be let go. The boy then careens on down the street and out of sight. *No child should ever wear that look. Not for any reason,* he thinks as he walks into the building. Not one floor up he can hear screams and shouting, and as he enters the apartment he finds a large man in a drunken rage and a woman with a face that is unrecognizable through the bruises and blood.
**"Who the hell are you? What are you doin' in my house?"** the drunk rages. The walker shakes his head as his hand lifts towards the drunk and from his palm a chain lashes out to encircle the man's throat. The walker reaches up with his other hand and yanks with all his might, jerking the drunk off his feet and to the floor.
The walker approaches and straddles the man's back, gripping the chain and pulling cruelly upwards. As the drunk gasps for air and struggles the walker whispers in his ear: **"I met your son running in fear. I've got someone I'd like to introduce you to. He makes me run the way your son did…"** As his voice dies out an apparition coalesces in front of them taking a form most hideous.
The drunk's eyes widen and his struggles grow more violent. The walker tightens his grip and puts more weight on the man's back to keep him pinned. **"Hold still, it isn't going to hurt you… Much,"** the walker says with a disturbing grin blooming on his face...

### **Magical2099** (2010-09-29 03:33:44)

**Name** Eugene Jones "The Green Man"
**Concept:** Country boy given power over nature.
**Powers:** Control over plants and the ability to become a plant, becoming stronger and harder to hurt.
**Why Are You a Hero?** His country upbringing instilled a strong sense of right and wrong, as well as the mentality that if good men let it evil happen they're just as guilty as the evildoers.
**Why Are You Interested in Heroes, Inc.?** He's hit a wall in dealing with large corporate polluters, he's hoping that with the group's help and the company's legal expertise to find a way to deal with the people polluting his woods.
**List One Past Adventure:** Liliana's grip on his neck was surprisingly strong for such a small woman. **"I missed you,"** she whispered in his ear as he dropped the meat from the deer he had bagged earlier today.
**"Ah know sugah. Ah missed you too,"** he replies, still amazed at the sweet girl who'd taken a liking to him. He didn't care what the town said about her and her religion. He'd fallen hard for her, and his parents had taught him beliefs don't matter, actions do. Just like skin color or sexual preference. He may not understand them, but he didn't understand much to begin with.
**"Fresh meat? You killed another deer?"** she asks with a disapproving look.
**"Yeah sugah, Ah did. If ya don't keep 'em in check they start starving as a whole. Besides, with the skin drying outside Ah'm gonna make you a new coat,"** he says smiling.
**"You're the only person I've met in a long time that understands 'Husbandry' you know that?"** she asks.
**"If ya mean common sense and not wastin' and not bein' greedy, then yeah darlin' Ah reckon Ah do,"** he replies.
**"I won't be here much longer lover. There are men coming. Men with the corporation you helped me stop from stripping the land next to us. You need to be ready when it happens,"** she says as she stares off in the distance.
**"Aww sugah, you worry too much. Ain't nothin' gonna happen. The sheriff's just down the road if'n we need 'im. Besides, they come here and Ah'll set 'em straight and quick like,"** he replies, flexing his large construction worker's arm jokingly.
**"Here they come,"** she says hurriedly, then grabs him by the hair and kisses him deeply and fully, and he feels a strange pressure flowing from her and into him. **"I love you,"** she whispers in his ear as she lets go and the world goes crazy.
The door crumples under the weight of a blow from a massive man who enters and strikes Eugene. The punch puts him through the opposite wall and knocks him unconscious. When he wakes, he finds his house in shambles and Liliana gone. Months of searching and asking questions uncovers little save trouble involving the massive man who destroyed his house. In a battle with the man in the parking lot of the corporation he discovered his powers as he beat the man unconscious and then tore the office down slowly with gigantic trees, Nature taking its vengeance for their trespasses...

### **Snowkrash** (2010-09-29 19:13:16)

**Name:**
'Pa-Hanok'; Jeremy Halstead (Frost) , Haruk Jubarisuranama (Snowkrash)
**Concept:** 
Pre-antediluvian alien life force split into two personas
**Powers:** 
Paragon template – flight, god-like strength, speed and stamina, light (photon) based powers (i.e. force shield, light based ranged attack, heightened senses)
**Why Are You a Hero?**
In this life, to help mankind and be its protector and be a symbol of light and hope; to stop the agents of the Void wherever they may be; to prevent the time of the Endless Night
**Why Are You Interested in Heroes, Inc.?** 
To be allied with those who share that same goal. One hero alone cannot save mankind, an alliance of heroes could do more than just save a city, they could save the world.
**List One Past Adventure:** 
“Not too long ago, when I was still new to this world, I had learned that an ancient evil had been resurrected from depths of the dark places where I had banished it long ago; in my time, we called it the Void. The Void, no longer a being of physical form, conscripted dark agents to carry out its will in the world. These individuals cause calamity and misery, spreading confusion, fear and terror to all peoples in this realm. These individuals were working to bring about the time of the Endless Night. I still unfamiliar with this age of man, and his ‘laws’ wanted to simply meet the evil in its lair and defeat it! My counterparts advised me, this was not the way things were done in their time. I was forced to concede that I simply could not go about and dispense justice to the world, as I saw fit to in my era.
My dual selves advised me on a course of action that was more subtle; they managed to infiltrate the organization that was under the influence of the Void. Before it's agents could unleash their plan on the world, we seized the opportunity and confronted them in a most glorious battle. We fought for many hours, and though the enemy was mighty and numerous, they were no match for our combined wit and power. We were triumphant! The victory was not mine alone, but it was a victory shared by all of us. I knew from that day forward that I could no longer fight this battle solely as myself; if I have learned anything from my time in the world beyond, was that I needed my dual selves, just as they need me. In this, I found strength, courage and the will, to be a force for justice and fight this evil wherever and whenever it may be. By this act, I was made whole and I knew that I was more than in my life before; I know with their help, I can be worthy of the forgiveness and redemption that I seek.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-09-29 22:53:26)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Shinobi**</span>
**Concept:** Expert master of Ninjutsu, as well as many other forms of martial arts, including the "lost" schools of Ninjutsu that doesn´t solely relate to fighting.
**Powers:** No powers! Well, at least no supernatural powers, just rigid training to a degree above most humans. So no supernatural, Naruto-style, ninja magic junk, just training, pure and simple. Kind of like Batman, though more low-tech and a bit different in other ways, though with many similarities as well.
**Why Are You a Hero?** Fighting crime and especially villains in posession of great powers seemed like a good challenge for my skills. Plus it is always nice to show the world that techniques that were invented centuries ago can stand up to the worst villains of today.
**Why Are You Interested in Heroes, Inc.?** Working as part of a team makes things easier, even though I do what I do best alone. And if you were wondering, that would be stealth, sabotage and infiltration. But of course, the more the merrier.
**List One Past Adventure:** -Coming-

### **DarthTardis** (2010-10-01 17:06:02)

**Name** Captain Jack McGuiness
**Concept:** Former US Marine captured by al-Qa'ida and experimented on. They were hoping to design the perfect infiltration experts by using experimental DNA re-sequencer.
**Powers:** Morph physical features, super int,str,tough, ability to control most aspects of his biology, can form limited bio weaponry as well.
**Why Are You a Hero?** Before this he was a marine fighting terrorists now he has the ability to do more than that. He feels its his duty to stand up for those who can't, to stop injustice and evil.
**Why Are You Interested in Heroes, Inc.?** No such thing as an army of one. You need a capable squad if you want to accomplish your missions. heroes, Inc has the up and comers of the Hero business. He is here to learn and help in anyway he can.
**List One Past Adventure:**
I must have laid in that pit for what seemed like eternity as the serum the injected me with warped my from the inside out. Writhing in the mud that formed from my own fluids, horrible mutations sprouting out of me. I thought having hot shrapnel ripping through your guts was the most painful thing I had ever felt, till that. I guess it beats dying though.
As the pain lessened I started to actually feel better, my wounds had closed spitting out several pieces of shrapnel, I keep one as a reminder. They became excited when they saw my recovery. The next few weeks they ran test after test. Let me tell you the ability to regenerate is nice, but I learned about its draw backs after they started cutting off the same finger over and over for fun. The few times I was left alone in my cell I started testing my abilities. Once i figured out some of the cooler tricks of "Bio-manipulation" getting out of there was a lot easier. I manged to make it out in to the desert where I wandered for days till I was picked up by an Army helicopter.
After returning to the states I was given a purple heart and bronze star for bravery. I resigned my commission in the Marines and returned to civilian life but it seems hollow, like I should be using these gifts for something better. So here I am at Heroes, Inc.

### **Frost** (2010-10-01 17:48:49)

**Name**
William Janus a.k.a. Void Walker
**Concept:**
Scientific experiment with unexpected results;
**Powers:**
Psion template – Telekinesis, Mind Blast, Mind Reading, Dimensional Travel, Possession, TK Flight
**Why Are You a Hero?**
Heightened intelligence leads him the logical conclusion that man is flawed; he needs a mentor and guardian if he is to survive
**Why Are You Interested in Heroes, Inc.?**
Logic dictates that all men fail when they are divided; brought together by a common cause, there is nothing to what man can accomplish; he wants to be apart of a greater good
**List One Past Adventure:**
During one of my encounters with a being known as Psi-kotick, we had become locked in a fierce mental battle of wits and power, one was no more powerful than the other. I assessed the situation as being pointless; we could continue this conflict until the end of time. My concern was that several innocent people would be injured due the display of raw energy we both possessed. I felt the best course of action was not to fight at all; so I decided to change the battlefield, thereby giving myself the advantage. Using advanced quantum physics and the knowledge of an infinite number of alternate dimensions, I simply teleported us to a dimensional he could not survive in. He succumbed to the conditions of the alternate reality and once he was incapacitated, I returned us both back to Chicago, were I turned him over to the municipal authorities in that city.

### **Snowkrash** (2010-10-01 18:32:17)

**Name**
Harold Riddle a.k.a. Pinnacle [Public Identity]
**Concept:**
Mystical defender; Endowed with inhuman strength and stamina;
**Powers:**
Powerhouse template – Superior strength, incredibly tough, ability to reach Large size, deep thinker
**Why Are You a Hero?**
I was chosen to be defender by the spirit of the Earth itself; I try to do as much as I can with the time I’ve been given
**Why Are You Interested in Heroes, Inc.?**
I’ve always been fighting my cause alone, but I see there are others, others who believe as I do; so why do it together, right?
**List One Past Adventure:**
I’m a bit new to the whole crime fighting deal, seeing that I’m from a small town in Montana. Since you asked, I can remember a time I was in the woods near the Canadian border. Well I was out there thinking about what I was going to do with all this power, and why I was chosen to be this “defender”. By complete accident, I came across some smugglers. I think we really surprised each other, I know they scared the Bejebus outta me for sure! I think out of some gut reaction, they shot me first. I thought I was done for! Their bullets, they bounced off me, like shooting bb’s at a big rock. We were both in shock, so I used the opportunity to overturn their car and take their guns away. I still think to this day, they thought they ran into Bigfoot! That suits me just fine, I don’t want the attention. Anyway, once I got back into cell range, I called the local ranger and the authorities came and arrested them. Turns out they were drug and gun smugglers from South America; for the first time since getting these powers, I felt I did some good in the world. That’s why I came here, to do some good, to help some folks out and maybe learn more about why I am the way I am. Yeah, that’s all I got. Say? Wanna see me turn a steel bar into a pretzel?

### **Frost** (2010-10-03 04:18:28)

**Name** Ramsey Flynn AKA Amp
**Concept:** Garage band singer turned superhero
**Powers:** Sonic control array
**Why Are You a Hero?**
That is a good question. I'm a hero cause I wanna do the right thing, I guess. They say with great power comes great opportunity. Don't get me wrong, I totally believe in helping others and saving the city but you gotta admit its great copy for a band too.
**Why Are You Interested in Heroes, Inc.?**
So the band was a litte freaked out about what I can do, so I figured it was time to leave anyway - so I heard about these heroes in Motor City and I figured, "hey, they could use a cool member, ya know, it's a PR thing right? I need to belong to a band, and they need hip, upcomer like myself --so hey, I thought I'd apply. Could be a win win situation Right?
**List One Past Adventure:**
Well the Killer Kumquats were playing this sweet gig downtown, well ok we were warming up for the Sweaty Nipples out of Portland. Portland Oregon, any way. We had just finished and I was out back chatting up a groupie when across the street three guys in some sort of weird armor go flying by. Few seconds later 1st national bank is blown open. I bank at that bank, the band's accounts at that bank, I can't let these fools steal my green. So I run over and unleash my sonic scream at the one outside. He hits the wall so hard his jet pack thingie explodes knocking him right out.
I move into the lobby and see the other two cutting into the vault with frickin lasers, how cool is that! So I unleash my Earsplitter and while they try to figure out why their eardrums just ruptured I mop the floor with them. Needless to say I made the news the next day. I made sure to drop a plug for the band but the bastards edited out before it hit the air.
