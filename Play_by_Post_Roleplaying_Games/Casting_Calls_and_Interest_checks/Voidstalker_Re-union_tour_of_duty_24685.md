# Voidstalker Re-union tour of duty

Contemplating resuming the Rise of the Empire Campaign
If anyone who was in that game if your interested sound off. If we can't get enough of the old squad together we could always find some new recruits to fill in the squadron

### **Yogi** (2010-06-11 14:14:05)

Count me in. I think others may also be interested. (Tru and Zerah)

---

### **master_Tru** (2010-06-11 14:48:53)

Sounds interesting, been a while though. Where would it pick up again?

---

### **Frost** (2010-06-11 14:54:07)

I will have to research and see where we were at

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-11 15:47:04)

### **ganthet** (2010-06-11 16:04:12)

I think you know my answer to this Frost. HELL YA!!!! Want to play Deel again.

---

### **Frost** (2010-06-11 16:09:01)

All the starting squadron members have priority of course

---

### **zerah** (2010-06-12 11:47:44)

DUDE!!!! Arty ftw!!! ~ahem~ I'm so in >.>

### **Frost** (2010-06-12 17:11:07)

Sounds like this is a go then if a nice moderator would make an active folder for us in the rise of the empire section and move the old threads into it I will start figuring out where to start up again. Your last mission was Wookie-pops

Question: Is it ok with you if I rebuild my character? I had a major computer crash a while back, and have lost all files regarding the character. I remember of course the character with personality and all, but the exact statistics I´ve got trouble recalling. Plus, there´s been released quite a few new books since last time.

### **Frost** (2010-06-12 18:24:03)

You are all free to rebuild your characters using the newest and coolest rules just make sure you keep any new toys current to the era. I'm sure the Rebellion Era source book will be handy.

---

### **master_Tru** (2010-06-12 19:03:26)

Would it continue where it left off? Or start up again some time later?

---

### **Yogi** (2010-06-12 19:32:08)

What level? I remember we had a high point buy. 42 or something like that

You guys were like level 4-5 I think. Might as well make it 5 for sith and giggles. I think I used 32 points for point buy

No it was a high point buy that I remember. Both Antur and Jake started out with 18 for Dex.

I was chatting with Reb Saturday night. He normally only checks the game he's in that in the Rebellion section. I let him know what was going on. You may want to PM him to see. But like Zerah said he's around but he is pretty busy.
