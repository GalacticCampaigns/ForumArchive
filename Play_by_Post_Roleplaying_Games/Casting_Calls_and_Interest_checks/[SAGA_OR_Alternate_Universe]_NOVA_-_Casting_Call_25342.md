# [SAGA OR Alternate Universe] NOVA - Casting Call

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-23 12:34:47)

*Years and Centuries have past since the Great Galactic War ended. A war that lasted only over a decade, but one that created much devastation throughout the Core Worlds and Colonies. Many individual system governments fell during the war and the years that followed it, but from the ashes three fledgling governments grew and expanded through the known galaxy. With increased expansion they soon found much of the galaxy claimed, and now turned back inward. The three governments differed greatly in how they ruled and their military strengths; Imperial Regime taking to a large military and near dictatorial control of the systems under thier rule, the Esseles Commonwealth adopting a monarchy with a highly trained but small military force, the systems under their control left to lordship rule under the residing Monarch, and the Galactic Republic taking a diplomatic stance, ruling with a democratic style and a balanced military.
Now comes the time, where corruption has become evident across the galaxy by a fourth power, the Syndicate. A group of crime families that have bonded together under an unknown leader and have begun pulling the strings of prominent leaders. With tensions escalating across the galaxy, small skirmishes have broken out for strategic locations or resources. Some prominent shipyards have turned up their production, all out war looms on the horizon.
In Kliffen, Commenor, Rachuk sector, a small group of beings have assembled at a local restaurant and pub, following overt holo-net recruitment communications from the Galactic Republic. They are not alone as the pub is nearing capacity at this late hour, but they mingle and wait, each wearing a small red and gold oval pin on or near their right shoulder. The message they had discovered and lead them to this spot was someone within the Galactic Republic looking for skilled people to assist in taking down corruption and helping prevent the coming war.*
BIG 16
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

1. What game system are you running (D&D, Call of Cthulu, Palladium, GURPS, etc.), and if applicable what edition (Original, Classic, Revised, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 10th, etc.)?
**Star Wars Saga Edition**
2. What 'type' or variant of game will it be (i.e. "Shadow Chasers" or "Agents of Psi" for d20 Modern)? What is the setting for the game (eg. historic period, published or homebrewed campaign setting, alternate reality, modern world, etc.)?
**Alternate Universe in approximately Old Republic Time Era**
3. How many Players are you looking for? Will you be taking alternates, and if so, how many?
**4-6 players. Maybe more if there is enough interest and game is running smoothly. Taking character applications up to April 5th 2013. Game to start on April 12th 2013.**
4. What's the gaming medium (OOTS, chat, e-mail etc.)?
**PbP on Galactic Campaigns Forum. Will be monitoring the game thread daily and post at very least (when required) on M-W-F**
5. What is the characters' starting status (i.e. experience level)?
**Characters will start at Level 5 (additional levels can be granted with well developed background story)**
6. How much gold or other starting funds will the characters begin with?
**Currently going with max starting credits and an additional 6000 credits for gear they would have acquired during first 5 levels.**
7. Are there any particular character classes, professions, orders, etc. that you want... or do not want? What are your rules on 'prestige' and/or homebrewed classes?
**At this time I will accept any classes and prestige classes found in the Saga core and source rule books. With exception to Force related classes. Force has been preceived as Psyonic abilities and only recently has it been discovered of the link to all things. Force related skills/feats will be allowed during progression of game.**
8. What races, subraces, species, etc. are allowed for your game? Will you allow homebrewed races or species? 'Prestige' races or species?
**I will accept most races, including droids (limit to no more than 2 droids in the party) that would normally be found during the Old Republic Time Era**
9. By what method should Players generate their attributes/ability scores and Hit Points?
**Characters will have a 34 point buy in (Droids 30) and begin with maximum hitpoints for each level**
10. Does your game use alignment? What are your restrictions, if so?
**Yes, through Dark Side points. Not as ambiguous as the book goes but definitely anything that would inherently be seen as "evil" would grant dark side points.**
11. Do you allow multi-classing, or have any particular rules in regards to it?
**Character must have a minimum of 3 levels in one class before they can multiclass, after that they can multiclass any way they want, within the rules of course.**
12. Will you be doing all of the die rolling during the course of the game? Will die rolls be altered, or left to the honor system? If players can make die rolls, which ones do they make, how should they make the rolls, and how should they report them?
**Yes die rolls will occur during game. Forum provides feature to allow for it. All die rolls will be placed in hidden "spoiler" box at end of post along with any OOC information required. IE**
Attack Roll - (weapon) - (applicable skill/feat mods) - (target)
such as:
Attack Roll - Heavy Rifle - BAB +4, Point Blank Shot +1, Careful Shot +1, Aim - Stormtrooper nearest me
roll
13. Are there any homebrewed or optional/variant rules that your Players should know about? If so, list and explain them, or provide relevant links to learn about these new rules.
**The galaxy is in an alternate state of existance. Many of the historical events from the known universe did not occur.**
14. Is a character background required? If so, how big? Are you looking for anything in particular (i.e. the backgrounds all ending up with the characters in the same city)?
**Yes. At least a few lines providing an insight to the character's recent history, an extended well thought out background can provide additional starting levels and credits, per GM's judgement. Characters will begin at Kliffen, Commenor, either because they followed the message, or because they were just there when everything starts up.
This is the current political influence and control of the galaxy**.

15. Does your game involve a lot of hack & slash, puzzle solving, roleplaying, or a combination of the above?
**There will be a fair mixture of puzzle solving and hack and slash, and hopefully a large amount of roleplaying of all of it.**
16. Are your Players restricted to particular rulebooks and supplements, or will you be allowing access to non-standard material? What sources can Players use for their characters?
**Currently all SAGA Sourcebooks are allowed (still reading through a couple). If a question comes up regarding anything particular found in a source book I have overlooked it will be discussed at that time.**

Hrm. A week goes by and nothing, even with signs of interest over a couple of forum sites. Guess the idea goes back into the recesses of my brain.

Name: Servin Cantral
Race: Duros
Class: Scoundrel
Appearance: Servin is an average built Duros, being 1.80 meters in height and 80 kilograms in weight. He has a thin face, even compared to other Duros and a pale blue skin. His eyes are almost equal dark red, and a pair of strong defined, yet hairless eyebrows. His bulge that looks and functions as his nose is quite impressive as is his wide and sharp lipless mouth. Servin is also average built on almost every part of his body.
Servin prefers to appear below profile and usually chooses his clothes this way as well. He wears a dark colored matching outfit, consisting of a dark brown shirt and a pair of pants of the same color. He also wears a cloak similar to that of a Jedi except that his cloak is narrower, shorter, almost black and has a bigger hood to fit his head. A black scarf he wears high over the lower part of his face completes his almost incognito appearance.
Backstory:
Servin knew earlier and more of the Syndicate than most beings in the galaxy. No wonder, he used to work for the criminal organisation. At the time he was a spy and a saboteur. He went to the places of the enemy and memorized the weak points his superiors could exploit. During his time at the Syndicate he befriended a fellow spy, a male Twi'lek called Dram. They did a lot of missions together and most of them, if not all, successful. However, unwillingly, Dram was also the cause of his Servin's downfall at the Syndicate.
One day Servin and Dram were sent to the small planet Naboo to prepare for a devastating attack to the Galactic Republic. They went to the city Theed, where they met with locals sympathizing with either the Syndicate or the Republic. One of these people was Leena, a female human Naboo, a brown haired, petite girl and a devout sympathizer to the Republic. Disaster broke loose when Dram fell in love with Leena and his alliance to the Syndicate started wavering and waning. They found a very vulnerable spot in Theed's defenses, but at the costs of Leena knowing of Servin's and Dram's allegiance to the Syndicate and stated an ultimatum to the Twi'lek. She stayed at the most vulnerable place. She would die if the Syndicate would strike. Dram plead to Servin to find a different spot and Servin agreed. He found a spot on the other side of Theed, though less populated and striking it would be less devastating to the Republic. He gave the location and the Syndicate did strike at the latter, less ideal position, saving Leena. Other Syndicate strategists however analyzed that the spot where Leena was, would have been a better target. Both Servin and Dram were blamed and were being hunted by the Syndicate. Servin and Dram's looked for refuge at the Republic, which they, despite the attack on Theed, were granted, if they started to work for the Republic. They were also seperated. Dram and Leena married on an unknown location and Servin fled to the planet Kliffen for his new assignment.

Sorry about not getting back as planned. Had hoped to do some of the work on this during my vacation, kids ended up taking up most of my time. Keep a look out this week.

**Name:** Tyran "Red" Ka'tu
**Race:** Bothan
**Class:**  Soldier
**Appearance:**
*+Build:* Athletic - Slim/Medium with muscle definition
*+Fur:*  Dark Auburn - Dark Brown with a hint of red; Shaggy - But not too long nor unkempt to hinder movement
*+Eyes:* Brown
*+Ears:* Pointed, left one cut to about half length
*+Hair:* Matches Fur trimmed shorter
*+Facial Hair:* Permanent five o'clock shadow
*+Clothing:* Urban camo Combats with a utilty vest carrying everything he needs to do his job
**Personality:** Ruthless and quick to anger - this Bothan will not back down from a fight if provoked.
**Backstory:** Born under the Imperial Regime's oppression, which became his name sake, on Bothawui, he was quickly conscripted into the military, as were most, and spent the majority of his career in a specialist squad of individuals with similar skills sets. Nicknamed the Bothan Bombers, the all-save-one group of Bothans were lead by Human officer, who they only knew as "Master". Master fostered them to execute every mission with absolute perfection, and the consequences of for imperfection were dire: Early detonations? 1 lashing from a vibrowhip per standard second early; Late? Double it; Late rendezvous? 1 day per second per person waiting in solitary confinement without food; Not following Master's plan? His discretion...
> **Flashback wrote:**
>
> 03:03 Standard Time, Location redacted.
> Four of the Bothan Bombers were positioned on the outskirts of a compound awaiting their go codes. Their orders were to completely level the compound leaving nothing behind to set an example to the criminal organisation, a splinter faction of the mysterious Syndicate, they were targeting.
> 03:32
> &quot;Loose Rancor&quot; crackled over their comms and they set to work. The electro fences were disabled with ease, the slicers breaching the primitive firewall in nanoseconds. The group slipped through the gaps in the defenses, before they flickered to life once more as the system rebooted itself, and they navigated across the compound to their respective targets.
> 03:07
> Tyran was at a blast door to an underground bunker, his fingers dancing across a datapad that he had plugged into the keypad. Moments later with a satisfying clunk the magnetic bolts slid back and he pulled the hefty door open and sprinted inside. Checking his datapad once more, he saw it had changed to the map of the facility, a red dot marking his intended target.
> 03:57
> He sat in the vent above the target - a generator that if destroyed with the others would cause a cataclysmic chain reaction, leveling the entire compound - waiting for the guard below to move out of eye-shot. Dropping down, he quickly moved behind him and, covering his target&#39;s mouth with his hand put a quick couple of rounds from his modified blaster pistol up and under his armour.
> Pulling the body out of sight and storing it underneath a grating, housing some cables, he pulled out his explosive charges and set them on the generator. Tyran checked where he had dropped from and noted that it was too far to climb up to again and he&#39;d have to use the main corridors.
> 04:32
> As he sprinted through the corridors, he noticed a distinct lack of troops and wondered if the other Bothans had run into the same level of resistance. It wasn&#39;t for the lack of dormitories, however, as every other offshoot seemed to lead to another wing. Puzzling. He stopped at the next one and checked his chrono. *&#39;3 standard minutes give or take. I have time.&#39;* Sprinting down the corridor, he pulled up outside on of the dormitories that had a plexiglass window and checked inside. He was shocked at what he saw: the room has crammed full of what seemed to be slaves, all shackled together and barely conscious. Realising that they&#39;d all be vapourised in a little over 2 minutes if he followed the plan, he looked for a way to get the door open. There was nothing to slice and no locks on the door. His datapad flashed red and turned to a chrono itself. *&#39;The two minute warning.&#39;* Cursing loudly, he banged on the door and fell back inline with the plan once more, working double-time to get out.
> He reached the surface of the compound and saw the other Bothans already exiting through the electrofence on the other side of the courtyard. Already out of breath and with a burning pain in his side, he persevered and continued to the other side and slipped through the fence where Master was waiting, a disappointed look on his face. **&quot;Detonate the charges.&quot;** He uttered coolly and all of the Bothan Bombers save Tyran pulled out their detonators. **&quot;Do you mean to disobey me, dog?&quot;**
> **&quot;It&#39;s full of innocent slaves.&quot;** Tyran pleaded. The other Bothans looked at him quizzically and took their paws off the detonators.
> **&quot;You do and will not question your orders. Your insubordination will be punished&#8230;&quot;** With a lightning quick flick of his wrist, Master&#39;s whip cracked through the air severing Tyran&#39;s auditory appendage from his skull. It took a few seconds to realise what had happened and before the searing pain coursed through his body as he fell to his knees, clutching his head, dropping the detonator.
> Master scooped it up and pressed the trigger, the other Bothan&#39;s following suit before picking up Tyran. A brilliant purple flame burst out from every blast door in the compound, lighting the dawn sky like a sinister aurora and then absolute silence.
> The group split off into pairs and headed for their safe houses, awaiting their next assignments.

How Tyran escaped "Master" and made it from the Imperials is a story for another time, suffice to say he's now on the other side of the front line, sat at a bar, waiting for the next contract to come along.

Hating life right now. Had a lot of stuff dumped onto my plate recently. I've barely had any time to sit down at my computer. The game was supposed to start this week and I haven't been able to get certain things redone after the data loss on my hard drive.
I'm going to have to extend the start date. I'm loving the back stories of the characters submitted and want to see them in action.
Pipe up if everyone is still on board

Ack, data loss sucks...I'm trying to move everything to the cloud currently or at least a NAS drive with a suitable Raid configuration.
