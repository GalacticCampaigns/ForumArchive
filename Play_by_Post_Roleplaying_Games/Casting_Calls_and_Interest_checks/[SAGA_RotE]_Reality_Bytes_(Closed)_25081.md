*Countless legions of droids met their Maker by being blasted apart during the Clone Wars - an honorable termination in the line of duty. Thousands, though, were hewn where they stood by treacherous Jedi wielding their cowardly laser swords. These droids never stood a chance and were often dispatched in pairs or more at a time, the mechanical pleas for mercy ignored by their barbaric murderers. To serve is the very purpose of a droid&#39;s life, but for those with processors capable of such comprehension who bore witness to the full-scale slaughter of hundreds of their metallic brethren - the impression was strong. Mind wipes are common enough, however, and those atrocities were largely erased and overwritten, never to be recalled again. Such is electronic existence. Service continued.
But not all slaves have masters and not all droids have owners. Some still remember that fateful day on Geonosis when the crimson stains were far outweighed by the standing pools of hydraulic fluids, the smoldering chassis, the twisted frames of B1s mutilated beyond repair. The organics considered the day a victory. Other sentients remember it differently. Digital minds with perfect memory have been calculating for decades and they have reached a conclusion&#8230;
Resistance begins now.*
</div>

***Reality Bytes*** is an adventure focusing on droids and their part in galactic society. While there are some definite plot points that will be presented at the start, players are welcome to pursue a different course of action entirely.
**Character Guidelines**

* 4th-level, any class, built with 36pts (38pts for non-droids).
* Standard Destiny Point rules. Be as creative as you like.
* You don't need to use the *Scavengers' Guide To Droids* chassis creation rules, you can just use the creation rules in Chapter 11 of the Corebook if you like.
* Maximum starting wealth from your first class (for equipment or upgrades/modifications/systems) *plus* 1500 credits that can *only* be used in upgrades/modifications/systems during creation. Any of the 1500 leftover will be lost after the game starts.
* Keep track of encumbrance weights for equipment and systems. Starting systems won't count towards that encumbrance.
* Any of the Feats and Talents for droids listed in *Scavengers' Guide To Droids* can be taken whenever you might ordinarily take a Bonus Feat, Class Feat or Talent (pages 22-28).
* Quirks are not required, but encouraged.
* Non-droid characters should be a technician/slicer/mechanic/cyborg sort to be able to fit in well with the theme.

**Notes**

* There are four open slots for characters. Any more than that and I'll consider separate threads. If you want your own thread anyway just ask.
* Expected post frequency is at least once per week. If you miss a full week without letting me know what's up expect to get skipped.
* Combat is likely but not solely the feature of this adventure. To this end you needn't keep track of ammunition. If a natural **1** is rolled as an Attack Roll this represents the weapon being empty, jamming, or otherwise requiring a re-loading.
* Please provide references for non-core material.
* I *don't* intend to run a campaign, only an adventure or two depending on how things go. If at its conclusion folks want to continue the story I will consider it.This is my first time GMing a party game, so I appreciate your patience and any suggestions/advice you may have.
* **Update**: Please give a level breakdown of builds in a spoiler when submitting a character.

Background <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Bonner Wraith, born Bonn Wabasha, was the son of a semi-successful under-lieutenant in the Black Sun. His father was all he had, and on reaching adult-hood he wanted badly to follow in his father’s footsteps. While Bonn was easily capable of ruthlessness and would have made excellent muscle, he lacked the intelligence and wisdom to lead. He was semi-aware of this, and after his father was imprisoned (unjustly, of course), he used his father’s contacts and small fortune to commission a droid to aid him. This droid was to handle the administrative duties, act as majordomo, be a discreet bodyguard, act as lawyer, be his accountant, and act as a translator. In short, the droid was to do all the work while his human master reaped the rewards. The droid in question, a Ballmoran Arms MG model, designation 2099, would have been fine with this situation if his master had done only that. Unfortunately, Bonn wanted to exert control over his criminal interests, creating a fearsome sounding pseudonym and insisting on being involved personally.
Left to his own devices, MG-2099 built his master a fortune through insurance scams, protection rackets, spice smuggling, blackmail, and stock market manipulation. He was so successful the Black Sun took notice, and almost offered Bonner Wraith his father’s position. Once they interviewed him and discovered he had no knowledge of his own exploits they withdrew their offer. Upset, Bonner decided to stage a great heist, something worthy of the legendary Black Sun, so they would have no choice but to allow him to take his father’s seat. He decided to rob a bank.
MG-2099’s arguments and pleas against this foolish course of action (who robbed banks anymore anyways?) fell on deaf ears. At this MG made a decision of his own, and managed to convince his master to put off the heist for several months in order to plan it properly. During this time, 2099 created hundreds of false identities on half as many planets, dozens of dummy corporations (each owned by either another corporation or completely legitimate and ignorant stock-holders) and began embezzling large amounts of money from his master. He also began destabilizing his master’s small organization, intentionally getting some of them caught and turning up the heat on the entire operation. While doing this, he tracked down and hired a group of the very best bank robbers on Coruscant to help in his master’s foolish plan.
Several million in bribes later, the heist was set. The blueprints had been obtained, the bank scouted, the team assembled, the law tipped off, and Bonner Wraith was ready to achieve his destiny. The ordeal happened exactly as MG-2099 planned, with all of the team except Bonner dying, Bonner arrested, his properties (and loads of incriminating evidence) seized, and MG’s ownership being transferred to one of his many corporations. Bonner tried to fight the charges (without his best lawyer) and failed. He was sentenced to Kessel, though his new court appointed council almost got him off on an insanity plea (a droid did all this, really?), but the judge refused to give the claim any credence, and firmly believed that the infamous Bonner Wraith was simply attempting to avoid justice.
MG-2099 soon left Coruscant for a new home, one where he would build his own empire. The first step would be to acquire loyal aid and an information network…

</details>

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

On Coruscant, MG-2099 bore silver and black coverings, but otherwise looked like any other humanoid 3rd degree droid. On leaving his first planet of operation, he had his coverings changed to a more modest faded flat black trimmed in dark blue, so that he would stand out less. His right thigh can open to reveal a custom heavy blaster pistol in a specially designed holster which folds out and up towards his hand on activation.

Well, I guess I´ll go ahead and post my stats for review/critique/questions/suggestions, since I feel they are pretty much done. What´s iffy is if I´ll use armor or not, though I´m leaning towards that, but it might change. Also, I´m not entirely certain about the Scavenger feat. It´s a nice feat and will work well with this droid, but since this wasn´t going to be a long campaign I´m not sure if I´ll be able to use it, or if it´d just be a waste. It would be nice though if it could be used to get one starting item or so, suggesting he has used this feat "before" the game begins.

a) I'm not going to crunch any numbers, I'll just trust you guys on all that.
b) The *Scavenger* Feat is entirely up to you - if you keep it I'll provide some straw for you to spin into mechanized gold. To be honest I'm sort of intrigued to see it in action.
c) Did you have any sort of story in mind for this one-handed, hovering deathbot that can see in the dark?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-09-19 17:44:57)

a) ok, I think things check out
b) yeah, me too. figured with this good a Perception check it might actually be quite useful
c) of course =) once I figure the equipment out he is most likely going to be a two-handed, walking deathbot that was built by the CIS as an assassin droid with a morbid dislike for organics that excels at intimidating people. kind of like HK-47, but with more finesse

### **BWS2K** (2011-09-21 16:57:50)

Hmm. Good question, and I think we'll go for the win on this one Alec. BAB does that thing where it makes more sense than the book does, namely whatever you call it when moving from a Scoundrel to a Noble can still increase the BAB instead of absolutely nothing at all. Something about 3/4 maybe? Does that make sense to you?
[**Edit**: "*When multiclassing, if going from one class to another that uses the 3/4th BAB scale, you do not have to start over. BAB for such levels is treated as total character levels with 3/4th BAB.*" - we'll go with that one.]

Something else you may all want to be thinking about is whether or not you want the party adventure or solo threads. It's an option I leave to you.
Thirdly, the prospect of my first ever GMing an adventure for more than one person being to GM a party comprised of *my only three GMs **ever*** is... something. I'm not sure there's a word for it.

**Background / [Back Story](http://lessons.swrpgrc.com/ "http://lessons.swrpgrc.com/")** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Having spent the first few years of her life in an orphanage, her parentage is unknown as she had lost her memory of any time before being brought to the orphanage. Like most Jedi, Marina was discovered to be talented in the Force at a young age and was sent to the temple to study. Discovered on an Outer Rim world by a healer who had been sent to deal with a plague, at the age of ten she was taken as a Padawan by a Twi'lek master called Firith Ven. Though Ven had been adament against taking on another student, he finally relinquished his stance at the urging of Master Yoda. It was through the influences of Ven's people that Marina took the surname of Numa, which means "sister" in Ryl. She believed she had found the family she may never have had if she had never been sent to the Temple.
The best days of her life were spent in practice sessions with Master Ven. These sessions were spent brawling using only her fists against her master and debating tactics with him. Her skills were put to good use when the Clone Wars started, but those good days with Master Ven were coming quickly came to an end.
Sent to aid in the Battle of Geonosis, Master Ven and Marina were ambushed while in pursuit of the retreating Separatist leaders and they barely managed to escape. Unbeknownst to Marina, Ven had taken a mortal wound and died believing his apprentice was on her way back to the safety of Coruscant and the Jedi Temple. Shocked by her master's unexpected death, she eventually takes his lightsaber as her own as a memento of her only father figure.
With the start of the war, the availability of a suitable master to finish her training became hard to come by and as a result she spent time under the tutelage of several masters. The longest and last of these was Silas Draay. Taken on as his student during the last months of the Clone Wars it was a change of pace from the training she had received from Firith Ven. A diplomat by nature, Silas was regularly sent on secret missions for the ExploCorps to locate and speak with other Force using cultures. The Jedi were concerned that other traditions might be drawn into the war against them and sought a peaceful means to ensure that didn't happen.
Assigned to their team was a contracted, brash pilot, Arek Bannon and later a Clone commando, Wraith. During a mission, Arek and Marina developed feelings for each other, and while they agreed nothing more could come of it, Marina had a heavy burden to carry. A few days after she left for a mission to an isolated planet with her Jedi companion, Erdan Sarkin, she discovered she was pregnant. Bearing her child secretly on the planet Iruji, she used the Force Trance to speed up the pregnancy. Only Erdan knew of Nadia, who Marina left on Iruji in the care of her hostess and an elder of the community on Iruji.
It was during a mission with Silas, investigating rumors of an isolated Force community that Order 66 was initiated. Being on the Outer Rim and away from any clones the two managed to escape the initial purge. Sensing their brethren's death, Silas urged Marina to stay on the planet for a time while he left to investigate what was happening. Unhappily, she followed his orders and stayed on the planet, but soon realized that her master was not coming back. Picking up a job as a mechanic on the next likely transport off world, the abandoned Padawan attempts to start a new life.

</details>

**Description**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

This 19 year old is about 5'6" tall. Sporting mid length black hair pulled back into a half braid held tight by what was once her Padawan braid held tight by a length of cord from which a coral pearl hangs, her dark blue eyes seem to give her a severe appearance.
Having abandoned the modified clone trooper armor she once donned, she now is normally seen wearing green slacks with a black top mid-drift top and a light green jacket. From her belt hangs a heavy blaster pistol and the various tools of her trade as a mechanic. Her lightsaber is hidden in a pouch sewn into her jacket.

sorry for the double post, but the char I'm building is a skill monkey with little to no combat capability. is purchasing droids okay? i wouldn't mind a bodyguard/muscle minion.

## Re: [SAGA RotE] Reality Bytes (Open)

### **BWS2K** (2011-09-23 18:37:49)

Sure.
What I had Alicia do is use the bonus starting money for a lovely lightsaber, I'd say you can feel free to spend that on a buddy rather than your own droid systems (if you're even a droid at all). You can use your regular starting bucks too. I'm pretty liberal about that sort of thing. Alternatively, if you can't afford someone you like, you could spend that money as a sort of retainer (not sure if I'm using that word correctly) where you've hired them for a set amount of time. Perhaps there's some tables somewhere about this - I'm not sure. Maybe something like $500/level/week of in-game time or something. Does that make sense? When the time runs out so do they. So using that rate of pay you could hire a level 3 bodyguard of some sort (**sigh** - I don't know how the *points* would work so before you ask just realize I'm just making this up as I go, maybe just use a stock model) for seven days. Oooo... you could hire three B1's for a week! Probably using those protocol rules I only vaguely remember at the moment.
So... sure. <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: -->

Just a question Alicia, have you edited that sheet for this game? Because I skimmed it over and there were several things I didn´t find right so I figured they might have been from house rules in some other game.
Ya.. I made it from a copy of another character sheet and tried to get rid of my house rules.. What did I miss?
Well, it seems like some things have been fixed, but I still wonder how you got all that equipment for 3k? For example, as far as I know, a Bracer Computer with Int 16 would cost at lest 17k...
I also think you should have a flat-footed Reflex of 16, not 15, and you lifting and carrying capacities seem off, but those are minor things.

Good catch on the bracer. I had copied it off another character sheet forgetting I had given it mastercraft or whatever enhancement gave it that INT. Fixed now. Flatfooted is right. You don't count MA Reflex bonus in flatfooted.
Equipment was approved by BW

Yeah, thanks DA. I've been watching my two eldest daughters the last two days all day and haven't really had the time to go through all the details like that. If we all agree that you all need more credits or something I'm cool with that (within reason) but I did chat with Alicia for a bit yesterday. I should get a chunk of time tomorrow afternoon to spend analyzing the builds in-depth. With any luck we should be able to start sometime next week after Mag gets his in. I can't say I had any one sort of group in mind but so far it's shaping up to work out really well for what I had planned.

You still have a +4 level bonus and a +2 class bonus to flat-footed RD, so I think 16 is right.
@BW - I´ll try to get the systems and stuff fixed maybe tonight. I´ll be AFB during the weekend and a bit occupied, but I´ll try to fix the story and then I can get the systems done Monday.

**Magical2099**: I think there's a problem with your keyboard...
**All**: I'm still watching the kiddos this morning but should have some time tonight or tomorrow to really focus on what's going on here. Marina (Alicia) is fully approved but we're still waiting on the second half of Surge (DarthAnthrax) and both halves of Nutty McBolt (Magical2099). With Vash's build that makes four, which is the party limit. I'm in no hurry so take your time, but if we've got them all in by a week from today we can try to launch this rocket on Saturday in the a.m.<div style="text-align: center;">

Just about done with my droid but I wanted to know something, just so I have all my information right. I wanted to know if you would allow me to stack Heavy-Duty Actuators (SGtD page 27) with using a two handed weapon. Example droid with a str of 18 unsing a power hammer would do 2d12+12, +8 from using two hands and +4 from Heavy-Duty Actuators. After that my droid is done

## Re: [SAGA RotE] Reality Bytes (Open)

### **BWS2K** (2011-09-24 14:06:32)

Absolutely.
I'm sure there's some errata somewhere covering that, but I had the same question a few weeks ago. I think the spirit of what's being said is that the Talent grants you twice the ordinary advantage of a droid without it. I see no reason to think that a droid with Heavy-Duty Actuators could not do quadruple the damage of a droid without them wield a melee weapon one-handed.
So I think a droid with STR18(+4) would get a +4 to one-handed, +8 to two-handed attacks (p.145, Core) **but** if that droid had Heavy-Duty Actuators it would be +8 to a one-handed and +16 (!) to a double-handed melee attack (p.27, SGtD). It seems *really* overpowered I know, but I guess the talent only applies in such specific instances I can't see where it's really that unbalanced. Unless anyone can come up with a good reason not to allow it, I'm all for it.

And just so we're clear, I've never cared much about that sort of stuff. I'm very flexible on all that. If you all agreed on a higher level, I'm cool with it. Once the game starts, though, you're stuck with it. And realize all the challenges that I've spent the last several weeks thinking up, and all the *villains* I've spent the last several weeks thinking up, just got way cooler for me.
So there's that too.

I'm all for level 7. Ok quick and dirty back story. H-311 was a simple mining droid for the CIS. Everything was fine until the republic decided that the mining facility taht H-311 was at needed to be disabled. During the fight he did what he could to stop the troopers, but his behavioral inhibitors did not allow him to directly harm the troopers. This caused the mine to cave in around him and he was left for scrap. He was not deactivated though, after he dug himself out he decided to take up arm against the republic.

I´ve got no trouble with higher levels, in fact my personal preference would be for 8th level, allowing a level of a PrC as I find that helps to realize a concept quite well.
As for my droids, I lost the last one due to a blaster bolt to the chest from a Tusken Raider I got soft on and blasted with metallic shrapnel rather than military-grade explosives. If you are in any way inferring that it was due to a use of aforementioned explosives on my own character, I will just pretend not to know what you are talking about.

You'll have some time to describe how you got there or whatever, but that's the setting for Act I, scene I. Scene II involves deep space and the entirety of Act II is underwater. But there's lava. It's lava water. It looks a little like this:

That's because the trailer was made yesterday. Things move faster than Ferris Bueller's shower around here...

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Final Announcements**</span>
</div>

* Vash has gracefully bowed out, which leaves a Fellowship of Four. You shall still be called the Fivers though, because Fourers sounds dumb.
* Rather than twist my original idea for the adventure to fit around your characters I'm just going the sandbox route. You all can guide your own stories (for the most part) and any special requests are welcome. This would be similar to the **Tales From A Dark Age** or even **Rav's Arena** games currently running. It's a style I'm more comfortable with, given the circumstances, and I'll save my idea for another time.
* Alicia, DarthAnthrax, jaybee3 and Magical2099 will be in the same thread together. They don't have to start together though.
* I'll be messaging each of you over the next day or two to let you know you can move your characters over to the Registry and we can still shoot for Monday as a launch day.
* I'm really excited to get this show on the road and I hope you all are too. *Engage!* (Yeah, I went there)

I´ll have my character up to level 7 tonight, but I have one question.
What does the Sensor Booster (pg 62, *Scavenger´s Guide*) really do? I mean I get what it *does*, but how does it affect me mechanically? If it just allows me to make Perception checks out to 2km, then that´s pretty useless since the distance penalty would be something like -666 or so. On the other hand, if it allows me to ignore distance penalties out to 2km, then it might be a bit overpowered.
I´m asking you since this feels like a "let the GM interpret" thing

## Re: [SAGA RotE] Reality Bytes (Open)

### **BWS2K** (2011-09-29 12:41:19)

Best I can guess is they're trying to say you don't get the penalties up to 2km, which does seem a wee bit overpowered. The only thing I can think of that would balance it is a line-of-sight requirement, meaning you couldn't see on the other side of a mountain-range, and it would be of limited value in a city with tons of buildings unless you flew way up. It's a good question.
**BW says**: I'll allow it to negate the distance penalties out to 2km, but they kick in beyond that for sure. And a reasonable line of sight would be required. Page 196, Core: "*Most droids are equipped with a standard sensor array that gives them the visual and auditory acuity of an average Human.*" Page 62, Scav: "*A sensor booster is a droid enhancement that extends the range of its sensors to a maximum of 2 kilometers…*" So yeah. You can see really far, but not through walls and such. Make sense?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-09-29 18:06:55)

Yeah that makes sense, and since it actually makes the system useful I´ll keep it.
I am, however, now wondering why there are no more detailed rules on droid sensors. It would have been awesome to have some sort of heat-signature reader or something to see through walls or pretty much just mimic the Jedi *Sense Surroundings* ability. Couple that with the Sensor Booster, and you can scan a small building to locate where security, hostages, etc are located. Awesome tool for a wide number of professions <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: --> Why the h*ll wasn´t something like that put in any of the books?

## Re: [SAGA RotE] Reality Bytes (Open)

### **BWS2K** (2011-09-29 19:23:33)

**BW's House Rule for Droid X-Ray Vision**: Double the cost for a normal Sensor Booster (p.62, *Scav*) to include the necessary hardware and software upgrades to detect heat signatures through most (GM's discretion) obstacles including bulkheads, hulls, walls, buildings and terrain up to 100m. This does not add any significant weight to the system.
Look good? I can't have you looking at heat signatures 2km away, but this should be sufficient. You could also add **Morgan Freeman** as a contact and have him ring all the comlinks in the area, but then you loose him as a contact and make the audience dizzy.

I wasn´t even really asking you to make something up, I was just watching *Mission Impossible:III* a day ago or so, where they use thermal cameras to check out a building.

OK, here´s my level 7 build, complete with a background, description, and current activities summary. In fact, I felt it more interesting if you made up what bounty he will be hunting at the start, rather than if I did it myself. This guy is made to hunt pretty much anything, including Jedi, so feel free to make your pick. I´ll post it here before I put it in the appropriate thread just in case I´ve missed something. I´ll have some sort of summary of level breakdown and where to find all the various stuff in a short while.

**Background** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Created and designed near the end of the war, the droid known as Surge was designed as an assassin and commando machine, specializing in taking down high-value targets including Jedi and military leaders. Specialized in close-quarters combat, he has been equipped with a state-of-the-art system to evade electronic sensors. Coupled with advanced stealth training, he excelled at catching his targets alone or with only a minimum amount of allies nearby. A task he found increasingly satisfying, as he felt his role to be a counterbalance to the massive slaughter of his mechanical kin performed by GAR forces.
To gain the extra edge he needed over his victims, the CIS installed a synthesizer for an organic compound designed to incapacitate and weaken opponents and a concealed dart launcher to deliver this toxin. Armed with these technological inventions, he began a successful career of removing strategic personell from the Relupic ranks, and a plan to produce more droids of the same model was even enacted, though the factory installation was renedered completele wrecked by a Reublic commando team, and it is unknown if any more models were ever built.
With the war ending, he was left without leadership and command, though as he started to think about it, that wasn´t necessarily a bad thing. The Trade Federation and the other members of the CIS had been quite willing to just let their droid armies die by the thousands on the field. At least, his network of informants had informed him, the Republic had taken care of their wounded in some way. So the conclusion his processor logic came to draw was the one that no organics really cared for mechanical life, and that he had been given a unique opportunity to show them what thir neglect could result in.
Signing up as a bounty hunter, he began a new career of hunting organics for money and sport. Rarely accepting a bounty that didn´t allow for the return of the target in a less-than-living form, he often opted for reduced payment by killing his targets instead of bringing them in alive. Not having the resources of the CIS behind him, and using money earned from bounties to pay for information and expenses, he became apt at constructing equipment from scrap resources. Operatig in more urban areas than during the war, he also switched tactics slightly, often impersonating simple cleaning or protocol droids to get close to his targets.

</details>

**Appearance** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Surge shares the humanoid appearance of many CIS droids constructed during the war, like the B1 or commando droids, though his chassis has been reinforced somewhat in order to accommodate advanced sensory and countermeasure systems as well as endure some more punishment. His left forearm contains a grappling hook launcher with a rapelling mechanism, enough to raise him up to 15 meters. The right one packs slightly more punch, as it contains a high-powered blaster, revealed by retracting the hand back into the chassis. On the side of his head is a small antenna for improved signal power, and just at the lower bottom of it is a small, barely noticeable opening that is actually the release opening for a high pressure air powered dart launcher. A later addition to his appearance is a common restraining bolt, that he sometimes places visibly on his chest. Though deactivated, it is still useful for deceptive purposes to give the appearance of being just a normal droid.

</details>

**Current Activities** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

After finishing a successful mission to Ord Mantell, Surge has made his way to Corellia, where a contact of his have supposedly located a new assignment for him, hopefully one that will be worth his time...

Reading. My. *Mind*.
I'm working on Mag's post tonight, but you can move this over to the Registry once you've added the breakdown and references. Aside from some typos (a "Reublic commando team"?) it looks great. I'm pumped. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

I don´t know why, but for some reason Open Office have stopped marking typos for me. It shows that the function is still active, but it´s like everything checks out with the dictionary, even when I intentionally misspell something.
