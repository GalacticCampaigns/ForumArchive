For the past several months, I've been tinkering and editing a homebrew D&D 3.5e world called Grey Sky. Originally, it was a stand-alone world with connection to Eberron via the ocean. However, as time went on, my players and I wanted to branch out, so I've included races and classes you wouldn't normally find in a D&D campaign. Basically, if you send me a certain race or class, with a link to the source info preferably, I'll review it and decide whether it's in or not. Please note that I might allow some things from one book, but not others.

Are you intending on sticking with just chat games? Or are you starting a PBP if there's enough interest? I know there's some members here that wouldn't be able to commit to a chat game.

I'm very willing to do PBP games, because they have the advantage of not having to stop just because someone has to get off. They can just post later. Very helpful during fights.

Well if it´s PbP, you can count me as interested. I don´t really have any suggestions for new races, but if you´re doing 3.5 I´ve always found the various options for player races and bloodlines in Unearthed Arcana to be interesting.

Question: Is the sky actually gray?

A lot of the time, yeah. All though there's one city where it's flaming red. A lot of the cities in the hub are named color-object. Black Ridge, Grey Fern, Red Sky. But, they're all aptly named. Black Ridge, for example, was built on a cliff with an entirely black face.
EDIT: So it seems one, maybe two people have seemed interested in ten days. Considering the size of the group I normally run is two plus myself, this is plenty for me. I'll give it until the twentieth to acquire more players, and then I'll put in a request.
