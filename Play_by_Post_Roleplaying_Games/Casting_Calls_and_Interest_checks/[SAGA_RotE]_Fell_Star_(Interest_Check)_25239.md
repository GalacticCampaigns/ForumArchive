# [SAGA RotE] Fell Star (Interest Check)

<div style="text-align: center;">
***It is a time of adventure. Heroes and villains alike seek their fortunes across the galaxy. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Mos Eisley spaceport, a wretched hive of scum and villainy situated on the desert planet of Tatooine.
The Hutts command a strong presence in Mos Eisley, but they are not the only criminals. Rival syndicates and cabals prowl the dusty streets, making profits at the expense of one another, as well as society at large. Inevitably these disparate groups collide, their conflicting interests leading to open strife.
As unrest grips Mos Eisley&#39;s underworld, Prello the Hutt contacts a group of mysterious heroes, requesting their aid in locating one of her most valued retainers. Can they find him before his enemies do?*** (p.193, Star Wars Roleplaying Game: Scum And Villainy)
</div>

It's sort of quiet around here as of late and I'm considering running this adventure from the S&V book. I like the Rise of the Empire Era in general though I suppose I could try some other time (I just don't know much about the others). The adventure is designed for four low-level characters (CL2) which I would scale depending on how many wanted in. I had planned on running this back around Thanksgiving with some friends and family just for fun but thanks to copious amounts of turkey and snow we just never sat down to play. I'd mostly be running the adventure by the book (...*mostly*) and it gives a great chance to visit some interesting places. It doesn't matter to me whether players would want to have characters that knew each other beforehand or not seeing as Prello could just as easily contacted folks off-world for help. It "*focuses primarily on the seedy side of life in the Star Wars universe*" but I'd welcome any class. Jedi would probably need a good cover story (We'd be playing post-Order 66).
Thoughts? This isn't so much a long-term thing as it is some filler and chance to just keep things going. Once the adventure is over we'll reassess things and see whether we want to move forward or not. To be clear (for myself as well as the players): This scenario would be over when it reaches the conclusion mentioned in the book (which I won't spoil here for folks not familiar with it).

Any limitations? Book wise? race wise? etc?

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-03 19:42:53)

Meh. You know how I roll - gimme a good excuse and I'll pretty much take anything. Dark*er* characters would be alright as long as we're not talking about Sith wannabes. Although considering the nature and goal of the adventure, a Sith might actually be interesting... but you can't be Vader or Palpatine so that's out. Dark Side scores on the low side would be acceptable I guess but you'd have to still have to play moderately well with others. We'd hammer out details together though.

Oky dokes. I'm game.

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-04 11:59:41)

If it helps, we'll use **5 BBY** as a suggested year. Well into Imperial rule but not too close to Episode IV. Also - about restricted races: I would need an exceptionally good reason to allow something like Ewoks, Noghri, Chiss, Vong, etc. since they simply aren't out and about during this time.

### **Duggs** (2012-06-04 12:25:50)

I would be interested in playing this.

I could also be in on this. Nothing like a little action on the shadow side of the Galaxy. I have a few suggestions though:

* Bump the level just a little, especially if you´re planning on just running this for a short while. Starting low-key is all well and fine, but if I know the character is living on a rather short time span, it is nicer to actually have some tools to play with. Of course I would prefer that you keep this running after the original adventure is up, so in that case I wouldn´t mind.
* I´ve always felt like that the background mechanic works better when running a little "shadier" games than does the destiny mechanic. I´m not sure why, but I think it is because removing that "larger-than-life" quality that destiny brings makes the characters a little more…normal. No heroes among thieves, basically.
* Would you please consider coming up with some other name for that Hutt? Seriously, Prello sound like the name of a rather pathetic comic relief character (you know, like Jar Jar), not some badass crimelord. Only reason I could find it appropriate is that it kind of rhymes with Jello, and the character is a Hutt…

Those were just some suggestions on my part, I´ll likely be game even if you don´t use them at all. Except the last one, that one should be considered more of a demand...<!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

All good suggestions DA. I agree about the **Backgrounds** but I might House Rule them a bit once I refresh my memory on them. I'll consider a **higher starting level** but I don't want to go too high so as to have to tweak the scenario too much. Prello isn't a mean Hutt, she's a *nice, caring, motherly* Hutt... but maybe we'll call her something else. Maybe... Judith? Big Momma Anthrax? <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
I'll have a Casting Call up in the next couple days then so watch for it. Enjoy your day/night!

### **jaybee3** (2012-06-05 02:14:41)

I vote Big Momma Anthrax!

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-06-05 02:53:30)

...as long as the twist is it's Martin Lawrence in costume.

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-05 06:23:39)

I make no promises. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-05 06:58:41)

Whoa now. There's one promise I will make - **No more Andy droids.** That was a lesson *learned* amigo. <!-- s8/ -->![8/](https://i.ibb.co/kVxpy8vX/icon-eek.gif)<!-- s8/ -->

I've got my ear infection(s) from a couple weeks ago back again so I'm pretty much asleep, or trying to sleep, all day. I took this evening off from work (which I *hate* doing and have already done three times in my first two months) and I'm headed back to bed shortly, but I just re-read the stuff on Backgrounds and I think we'll just go ahead and use them as-written, unless anyone has objections. Level 4, 32-point builds (28 for droids). We'll use the rule about ammo where you don't track it - just assume your pack is charged unless you roll a 1 on an attack, which means it's out. I may ask for you to track ammo with some special cases (missile launchers, for instance) though. Don't worry about a ship. Starting wealth for class *plus* 1000c to use for whatever. I feel like Contacts are appropriate but then I'm not sure that people use them much - thoughts?
I definitely need a little write-up on your character concept before you bother running numbers though, a paragraph (that's **5** to **7**sentences kids) will suffice. DA and jaybee - you know how flexible I am on character creation. Duggs - I err on the side of Awesome so if you have something that you just simply can't afford or really want or need or whatever please tell me and we'll try to work it out somehow. I'll have the official Casting Call up hopefully by Monday but feel free to post here until then and you can just move characters over.
Anyone else interested in this? I've still got a slot open...

Ouch! Ear infections....SUCK! I remember when I had mine years ago (one of the reasons I started playing EVE. Because I was bedridden) all I could hear for weeks was the thump of my heartbeat in my ear.
Re: game, I'll shoot you over a background.

### **Duggs** (2012-06-06 12:52:22)

As soon as I get back from vacation I will work on getting a background shot over to you.

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-08 12:10:34)

Casting Call is up in its own thread. You're welcome. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
