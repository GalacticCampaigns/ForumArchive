# [CLOSED] Casting Call: Tapestry, the Tattered Edges

### **Anazider** (2010-08-08 23:46:29)

**((Opening Crawl))**
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">STAR WARS: Tapestry, The Tattered Edges</span>
The galaxy is in a state of constant turmoil. With the surprise emergence of a new Sith Empire, the tentative peace assured for the last century by the Galactic Alliance and Jedi Order has been shattered, while Roan Fel, the Emperor-in-Exile, strives to regain the new-found glory of the Empire, and restore the galaxy to order under his rule.
Profiting from the chaos is the Fringe element. On the frayed outskirts of civilized society live the pirates, smugglers, bounty hunters and others that thrive on the strife and discord engendered by a galaxy perpetually at war. But even on the Rim, far from the core of galactic civilization, legends are born, heroes die, and even the lowliest moisture farmer will make decisions of epic proportions.
********************************************************************************
Greetings ladies, gentlemen and children of all ages and welcome to the Tattered Edges! I am reopening my casting call to fill exactly one slot. Character building guidelines are as follows:
* Currently not looking for any Force-Sensitives, as the self-imposed quota has been reached.
* 32 point buy for stats (does not include racial changes)
* Max HP for level
* Build up to level 5
* credits = max starting of first level + (level -1) x 2,000, multiple the total by 2 if you begin with Wealth; If you take wealth at all please remember that the credits may not be in just the form of equipment or currency. They can be used to purchase RP resources such as contacts, etc. Ships may be allowed under *special* circumstances. Discuss this option with me before building it in.
* Resources: Throughout a character's life, they develop access to several resources in the form of non-liquid wealth, contacts in all walks of life, and favors owed. You will have available to you an amount of credits equal to your starting credit amount. Some of these credits may be used for starting equipment but it will be HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that they be devoted to some RP element. Any questions, comments, and/or concerns over this system, please don't hesitate to contact me.
* Use any and all books and supplements available, although I ask when writing out the stat block you make a list somewhere of where the non-core references are coming from. This includes equipment. Player-made supplements may be used but after strict evaluation and approval by the GM.
* Race selection is Era specific. Make sure to look in the Wookiepedia to see if they were actually around during this time. If I see they aren't then the character will be denied. Homebrewed races may be allowed after GM scrutiny, and there is a game specific race (the Hobben) that is available for use.
* Detailed, well written background and description required.

Background<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Gist is an old warrior who's forgotten more than most know of tactics and wars. Born in 820 BBY, he fought his first battle in 596 BBY, the First Battle of Zeltros. That war was short lived due to the Zeltrons’ pheromones, though he attributed the loss to a lack of discipline in the ranks.
In 490 BBY, when the Corporate Sector Authority was founded, he accepted a commission in their forces as a soldier. He stayed there, working his way up the ranks till he became a drill sergeant. He kept that post until leaving in 60 BBY.
After returning to the larger portion of the Galaxy, he stumbled into the Mandalorian Civil war. He aided the Journeyman Protectors in battle, and then was brought into Mandalorian culture. There he stayed many years, working as a mercenary and trainer for organizations that would pay his fee. He watched the Republic fall after training troops for the Separatists, and the Empire rise. He trained rebels to fight them, and saw that government fall as well. He worked for crime lords, pirates, legitimate governments, and not so legitimate ones. He trained New Republic troops to fight the Vong, showing them some tricks he learned from his time with the Mandolorians.
Over this time he devoted most of his earnings to his armor and his home. His armor was a terrifying sight to behold. It had an advanced HUD, built in computer system, and built in rotary blaster cannon mounted on its right forearm and grenade launcher mounted on its left shoulder. His home was on Mandalore, a modest subterranean dwelling. He travelled so extensively that he simply kept it stocked with non-perishable foodstuffs, until he met a female Gen’Dai named Lu’u. After the traditional Mandalorian wedding ceremony involving simple vows to each other, he showed her to his home. Throughout the wars he adopted many children of a variety of races. His home took on the life he couldn’t give it alone, and he longed for the end of every contract so he could go home.
After the Vong war he felt his mind deteriorating. Between his age and life of constant violence it didn’t truly surprise him, but the severity did. During the Vong war his home was destroyed in the Vong’s last ditch effort to exterminate the Mandalorians. He returned there to find rubble, but in one of what he would come to call his “confused” moments he didn’t realize it. He wandered the halls calling for his wife and children, unaware of the destruction all around him. After brushing off the fog of confusion, he awoke horrified, unable to find his wife or children anywhere. To this day he doesn’t know what became of them.
Recently, his reputation has suffered from his deteriorating mind. With no contract to train troops he had taken up bounty hunting. Working with a Nagai named Sudo, he tracked a Zeltron called Rijhani Shaan to the Hedd system to find a Sith occupation fleet. After his partner was killed, he was taken captive by the Zeltron's new friends: the resistance fighters of Hedd. Through some careful negotiating with the leader of the resistance, Queen Tara Braynon (the Zeltron's new lover), he was freed, on the condition that he train their troops. He agreed, because the situation kept him close to his quarry. His tactics and training kept the resistance going much too long for the Sith Lord overseeing the occupation. Lord Etude orchestrated a coup, killing the Queen and her Zeltron lover, effectively ending the resistance. He was wounded during the battle, and hibernated until healed, then stowed away aboard a ship to escape the doomed system.
Shortly after returning to the Core worlds, he suffered the worst of his “confused” episodes. (Scene 1) After a stint in an Imperial prison he was released and his belongings returned; destitute, with no resources and most of his friends long dead or unwilling to work with him, he has gone back to selling his services as a mercenary. Since loosing his armor he has stopped claiming to be a Mandalorian, believing that his loss has made him undeserving of the label.
Since being back in the action, he's found that he missed it greatly. While the bouts of confusion are more frequent, so long as he takes short contracts with long bouts of downtime in between he's usually okay. His skills haven't deteriorated too much, as he's been able to re-equip himself. His newest acquisitions are far from new, being a repeating blaster carbine and a simple sword. He carries what’s left of his life in a large duffle bag, slung across his back. He wanders the galaxy looking for his wife, children and armor. (Scene 2)

Description<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Gist stands 2.4 meters tall, and weighs around 225 kilos, his body a wall of hardened muscle with few scars due to his healing abilities. His skin is a dark purple, with bluish highlights in the proper light. His eyes are a smoky, tarnished gold. His typical daily wear is brown mottled with black BDU pants and a tight fitting brown t-shirt. He wears a belt with many pouches with a holster that holds his carbine, which on him is about the size of a pistol. On the other side of his belt hangs a large simple sword. What stands out the most are the boots and gauntlets he wears; they large and heavily armored, done in black with green trim. He has been known to wade into battle with both weapons in hand, spraying his enemies with torrent after torrent of coherent light, gutting any fool who came near.

</details>

Scene 1<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Gist wakes to a series of sensations he hasn’t felt in a long time: cold, wet, beaten, and an unusual draft.
**“What the hell is going on?”** he mumbles as he stands. He tries to query is HUD as he looks around at the trash he had been sleeping in. **”Where the bloody hell am I?”** his deep voice echoes through the empty alleyway. When his HUD fails to respond he looks down discovering his armor gone.
**”My beskar? What is going on?!”** he yells, shocked at the fact that all he is wearing is his helmet, his gauntlets, and his boots. *That explains the draft, anyway,* he thinks, *All right, first order of business. Find out where I am, find my beskar, and kill whoever has it.*
He wanders out into the street and points at the first passerby he sees, a paunchy human in rich robes, **”You! What planet is this? What city?”** he demands. The paunchy little man cowers back from the massive purple, mostly naked Mandalorian before him.
**”Take all of it, here! Just don’t hurt me!”** the little man squeals, dropping a sizable amount of credits on the ground as he backs away.
**”I don’t want your filthy credits, di'kut, I want information!”** Gist bellows as the man turns and runs. **”Dammit,”** he grumbles, stooping over and grabbing the credits, then straightening to look around. *Hmmm, there’s a hotel. Better than nothing,* he thinks, turning towards the establishment.
After entering, the Devaronian receptionist's look goes from shock as Gist walks in, to appreciation as he is roughly half way down the fifteen meter foyer, to fear as he reaches the desk. Faced with 2.4 meters of Gen’Dai she stammers, **”M… may I help you?”**
**”A room, and a tailor droid. Quickly, please,”** he says, remembering his state of undress and hoping politeness would hasten the process.
The receptionist replies, **”Yes sir,”** as she presses the panic button below her desk, alerting the local Imperial police force, **”Right away, sir.”**
Gist stands before the desk, refusing to cover himself and add to the embarrassment of the situation. He turns to see a group of Stormtroopers pour through the doors.
**”There he is! That’s the one the senator said robbed him! Bring him down!”** the leader of the squad yells.
**”Wait just a bloody minute here, bo… Gah!”** his attempt at explanation is cut short by a stun grenade landing at his feet. The WOOOMPH of the grenade blinds and staggers him, and by the time he straightens he finds himself surrounded by troopers who, shocked by the fact that he still stands, begin pumping stun fire into him. He crumples quickly.

</details>

Scene 2<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Scene 2: *This has to be the sorriest bar I’ve seen since Tatooine,* Gist thinks as he sits back in his booth. Nar Shaddaa had been good to him lately, providing ample work. That’s why he was here, waiting for a prospective employer. The job description fit his preferred contract these days: training troops. *Just what in the hells is a ‘Hobben’ anyway? Sounds more like a food than a people,* he wonders as he looks towards the door again.
The door opens to silhouette a form that resembles a Zabrak. As the shadow comes closer it looks like some kind of half-breed. **”You are Gist?”** the Hobben askes.
**”That’s what I’m called by polite company, yeah,”** Gist replies, offering his hand and waving to the booth, **”Have a seat and we’ll discuss our business eh?”** *So that’s a Hobben. Where the hell did they come from?* he thinks as the being grasps his hand as if unfamiliar with the gesture then sits.
**”You’ll be working on Solsis VII, training my people to fight…”** the Hobben man begins, but Gist cuts him off.
**”Just a minute now, I wouldn’t say too much. Walls have ears here, and so do the tables ya see? Lets talk price okay?”** Gist begins, waving at the server droid.
The droid had made it only part way across the bar before the door is blown in by a shaped charge. Through the gaping hole comes a squad of Stormtroopers led by a lightsaber wielding shaved Ewok with red tattoos all over his short body and a necklace of teeth from a variety of species. **”Ohshimba ka Hobben!”*** he squeals, pointing towards Gist and his companion.
**”Palpatine needs to start training his troops better,”** Gist grumbles as he lobs a grenade towards the Imperials. The Hobben man dives for the backdoor and waits for Gist. **”Wait, that’s not Vader. Vader was taller. Bah, doesn’t matter,”** Gist grumbles as he roadie runs to join the Hobben.
As he hotwires a speeder parked outside the bar he turns to the Hobben, **”Where to, Boss? After that mess getting out of sight seems a good idea, yeah? We’ll discuss payment later,”** he says as they speed away.
*Translation: Take the Hobben!

This isn't a list of stuff my character needs, its a list of items he could make or would make sense for him to have. These are listed as an example of biotech and how expensive it is, which we had discussed in chat.

</details>

Background
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Zu Trem began his career as a Shaper in service to his mentor and lover: the Shaper Shai Carr. In their small settlement Shai Carr had begun gaining influence over the Warriors and already controlled the Workers. Her only opponents were the Intendants and Priests. In an amazing political coup she had the leader of the Intendants killed, and framed the Priests for the deed. Zu Trem killed the being with a specially grown ooglith cloaker, which crushed the life from the High Intendant. Shai Carr had him grow the creature for its simplicity: even a Priest could grow such biotech. While the Intendant and Priest castes destroyed themselves with in-fighting, she took complete control of the Warrior caste and eliminated the Priest and Intendant castes.
She swore Us-hrok to Zu for his service, and then asked her lover to leave. Zu, being much younger and believing wholly in Shai Carr’s doctrines about embracing technology and adapting to fit in with society saw his self-imposed exile as necessary for the growth and survival of their settlement. He had no knowledge of her new lover Etude, who had guided her ascent to power.
He now travels the galaxy living and hiding from persecution on the fringe. He lacks the traditional Vong religious zealotry, though he still embraces the concept of survival of the fittest. He continues to practice his Shaping skills, and has begun studying technology learning its secrets.

</details>

Description
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Zu Trem stands just under 2 meters, and weighs roughly 100 kilos. His body is covered in scars and tattoos, and the only hair he has is a topknot roughly 1 meter long. His skin is grey, save for the black tattoos and pale white scar tissue. He has the typical black eyes and hair common to all Vong. (clothing and armor unknown pending GM ruling).

The destinies and contacts and such are blank because I'd like to work them out with you Anaz. Try to find something that fits the game, ya know?
Vong: armor is not figured into the stats and Talents, Feats, and level distribution may change depending on your ruling on Biotech. For example, the level of soldier may be dropped for another level of Scoundrel if you rule against the Voduun crabshell.

### **Anazider** (2010-08-12 19:56:45)

I forgot to put this in the original casting call, but we are currently at capacity on our number of Force-Sensitive characters, and will not be accepting any more.
As well, I would ask that any feats, talents, powers, abilities, equipment, etc. not included in the core rulebook have an abbreviation of which book it came from and the page number somewhere next to its listing. I would also prefer it if somewhere in the application you listed your pre-species, level, and (if applicable) age adjustments so that I can see where all your stats came from.
Any other questions either post'm here, PM me, or find me in the chat. Good luck!

Courtney Calrissian is the great grandson of the famous Lando Calrissian. Son of the not so famous Lando“Chance”Calrissian Jr. His father didn’t have the head or the heart for business as his grandfather had. He took his inheritance and wasted it away over the years, losing the famous Tendrano arms to a hostile takeover and several other failed business attempts. The only thing that He kept was guardian YVH Gaurdian droid. This droid was from one of Lando Sr's original production runs. His father eventually started borrowing money and leveraging his properties to maintain his opulent lifestyle. This eventually caught up to him and he died broke and alone. The only thing left to youngster was a small trust fund set up by his Grandmother and his fathers YVH droid. When Courtney took possession of the droid after his father's death it must have activated some hidden sub routines in the old droid. S1VG started telling him stories of the good old days. It also had several holo-recordings from his Grandfather. After hearing the tales and listening to his Grandfather's recordings he decided that he would follow in his footsteps. He took his stipend and set out to rebuild the Calrissian fortune and name. He started hanging out in dive bars and casinos playing Sabbac and other chance games to improve his skills and his ability to understand sentients desires and motives. He worked as a deck hand on several smuggling vessels and has a great feel for piloting and people. He has his grandfathers quick smile and faster hands. Like his grandfather he has a taste for fine women, fine drink, and fine clothes.
He has recently decided to try and track down his grandfather’s old space yacht *Lady Luck*. He has heard rumors that it was bought by a Besalisk junk dealer called Thunner on some backwater world in the outer rim. He purchased transport to Solis VII and hopes to convince the Besalisk to sell it to him or maybe he will just have to “borrow” it.
S1VG (Series 1 Vong Gaurdian) YVH Series battle droid
S1VG was part of the first series of YV Hunters off the Tendrano Arms assembly line. It was designed to act as a body guard and was assigned to Lando as personal protection from the Vong and Peace Brigade. Lando kept the droid as a body guard and personnel assistant for the rest of his life. The droid acted as a sounding board for Lando and it kept recording and holo-vids of Lando Sr in action. Lando made a back up memory for the droid to protect it from memory wipes. Lando Jr kept the thing around but never heeded it's advice or learned from it. Towards the end he had it wiped and was considering selling it but died before the sale was finalized. Courtney received it and found the hidden memory core restoring the droids original memories. It is these memories and experiences that Courtney uses to guide his course.

The spot is still open, so supply a character with as detail a background as you can make. It would also help you to read the game to see where we are and what has occurred up until this point.

Background
The Duros species have traveled the space lanes since the time before hyperdrives. In those ancient times Duros pilots would navigate by instinct feeling the ebb and flow of the universe, following those instincts to bring their vessels safely between the stars. With the discovery of hyperspace technology the need for this sense became less needed. With a small percent of Duros the trait adapted and allowed them to navigate the hyperspace lanes by instinct. A cult of Duros formed around this ability. This cult believes that for every Duros who has this ability there is a perfect match for them. A ship that they were destined to fly.
Since he was a young child his ability to fly was extraordinary. Vehicles would dance under his touch and perform beyond their ability. He was brought into the fold of cult and his true talents where nurtured and enhanced. He has passed his initiation and was sent out into the galaxy to search for his ship. He loves space and the galaxy pulls at his soul. He travels where ever he can taking pilot job from anyone for anything. He doesn’t really care what the job is or if it’s legal or not as long as he get to fly a ship. Once the flight is over and he has decided this ship isn’t the one he moves on to test the next ship. He has flown several ships that had potential and sung for him like angels but in the end he knew they were wrong and eventually continued his search.
His most recent flight brought him to Solis VII. The ship that brought him was functional but it had no fire, no life. He has sensed something here though. He feels a pull towards this place he hasn’t felt in a long time. His destiny could be here.

**Background**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jaya Treiden comes from a traveling family of Arkanian engineers. Mechanical engineers in Arkanian society are under appreciated, compared to their bio-engineering counterparts. For the last several generations, her family has traveled the outer rim and unknown regions bringing technology and assistance to those bereft of it. They form a tightly knit clan living aboard their ship, the *Errakis ryn Arkania*, translated into Basic as Children of Arkania, a large ancient frigate, that has been modified beyond recognition. The ship, more-so than her family, has been Jaya's greatest teacher. She's been crawling around it's ducts and maintenance passages since she'd first picked up a hydro-spanner.
In her short life she has been from one side of the galaxy to the other, and met a wide variety of cultures. The family business travels to the core worlds for supplies and components, and then returns to the outer rim to sell the things they've created. For payment they accept precious stones and artwork made by the cultures they frequent. Solsis VII was one such place the Treiden clan dealt with, the Hobben's being very interested in rejoining the galaxy technologically. During their last arrival at Solsis VII however, they were not the only ones inbound at the time. A large Sith force was heading for the ground, and the sudden arrival of an indescribable ship spooked them enough into opening fire without abandon. The merchants offered no resistance and was quickly dispatched but not without launching a few escape pods first. Jaya and some of the other young Treidens were forced into on pod by their parents, and launched.
On the surface, a clan of Hobben found the children and offered them sanctuary. Jaya, as the eldest, looked after her family while in the confines of the village. Using components from the pod, she constructed a transceiver and a computer she uses to decode transmissions. Jaya uses her natural tendencies of staying hidden to the benefit of the Hobbens, stealing what she can from the government's outposts nearby. Jaya is certain more of her family are somewhere on the planet and with every message she intercepts and every outpost she steals from she hopes to find their whereabouts.

**Description**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jaya Treiden is a 15 year old Arkanian female. Her white hair is braided tightly into a long tail down her back falling nearly to her knees, with a pair of welding goggles resting on the top of her head. Dressed in dingy clothes that she has worn and washed for several months. Though the colors are faded it is obvious the clothes were once beautiful and stylish, but now several discolored patches hold the garment together, with the sleeves having been removed entirely. Over that last six months she has grown considerably taller (currently 1.6 meters), and the clothes are starting to show this trend.
Before the attack upon her families ship she was in an odd state of transition between child and adult. The younger Treidens looked to her for guidance, while the older ones demanded her obedience. All she ever wanted was a carefree life. Without an older family member, Jaya has had to grow up faster than she would have liked. And her dreams of jovial existence given up to care for those close to her. All of this distress has not stopped her from tinkering however, if nothing else her machines mean more to her now than ever before. They remind her of simpler days, and less dangerous times.

Noise does not agree with Daz Sult, in any of it's variable and... interesting incarnations. His childhood was spent aboard a transport specialized to ferry live animals of all demeanor and purpose. These creatures did not entirely seem to enjoy their trip and has no reservations about making that point entirely apparent, and while a young Daz would be tasked with general care to the more docile beasts and keeping out of his parents way, they would snarl and fill his durasteel home with tones both lamenting and furious. During frequent long trips through hyperspace, he would spend his time watching the animals he knew absolutely nothing about, imagining what kind of an alien environment they lives in compared to the corridors of a space-faring vessel that seemed never to stop. In time, these harmless imaginings evolved into fantasies of adventuring alone through jungles, mountains, frozen tundra, and environments he would unfortunately never come to exist in the galaxy.
Taan and Ift Sult, his parents, were passionate about their careers and the kind of life they could give each other along it's path, but a child had never quite factored properly into what they both knew they wanted. Promises to tour planets before leaving, to visit cities on Dorin, the mythical rock huddled between two black holes, where they would not need a breath mask (which Daz found increasingly hard to imagine), and teach him about what they did exactly were all left unfulfilled until Daz convinced his parents he was old enough to travel on his own, with much less coercion than he had originally anticipated, and was sent to stay with his Uncle Kuf who worked as a mechanic at a starport on Iridonia.
The environment on the Zabrak homeworld was terrifying and exciting in it's hostility and for the next ten years it tested him in ways that expanded his view of life, himself, and the universe as he had conceived of it. He had fallen in love with the wide expanses, despite the cities close clustering in valleys, and would lend himself to anyone traveling alone the surface and paid resolute attention to the terrain and the paths they would take by whatever conveyance until he had quite the reputation as a guide amount the community and in some parts beyond. His Uncle saw no reason to stifle the passions of Daz, so long as he stayed out of the way of Imperial authority whose oppression had failed to even register on the boy who considered his new life astounding free of borders, as he rapidly approached adulthood in his own right, and had no problem fixing or modifying the equipment he would take with him when leading research teams to look at local flora or fauna for whatever reason would possess them. If asked, Kuf Sult would solemnly admit to his expansion upon his own basic mechanical skills to be credited to his nephews enthusiastic destruction of his gear.
At thirty, Daz Sult was a full-time scout and guide for expeditions of any kind, with no real roots to even a sector of space and no preoccupations with current galactic stability, though he maintained a room at his Uncle house back on Iridonia whenever he needed to check in or was looking to replenish equipment. He barely heard from his parents, which he didn't mind as he'd pass messaging to them through his Uncle one or twice a year. His leisure time was spent with Big Game Hunter's mostly, though he preferred to hunt on his lonesome using low-yield rifles so to not actively kill the creature, never having shaken the memories traveling with his parents, but give him enough of a scare that he could leave from his hiding place unmolested. That was what he liked the most, spending hours inching closer to a being completely unaware of his presence, lying completely still in the wilderness watching creatures from a distance while he waiting for a shot he could not miss. The quiet before he squeezed the trigger seemed to make up, bit by bit, for the loud warbling and engine humms of his youth.
Four years later, a job passed down to him through the grapevine by a Slicer he'd done some work for pretty often, would prove to change his outlook on the skill set he had accumulated over the years. Now the Slicer went by the alias Kehlen Breez, and had commissioned Daz to act as vanguard and advanced scout for groups of Pathfinders and whatnot as well as gather surveillance data on simple geological sites or installations that proved tricky to approach. To put it frankly, the kinds of things that made Daz feel more like an ex-Military Merc who was much more familiar with killing people than he was. But Kehlen had never steered him wrong and was more than willing to do favours for Daz if needed so it was mutually beneficial.
The job description was brief; recon a safe house nestled in the shadow against the base of a large cliff on a dry and dusty moon on the otherside of the galaxy. He'd be provided with the recording equipment and a signal wand to transmit it to the team standing by in orbit. The Commando unit would land and take whatever entry route Daz suggested in breaching the facility, from then on he would observe and cover their escape if needed and rendezvous at an extraction point several kilometers away.
Any anxiety disappeared as the Team instilled their gratitude and reliance on his help before dropping him planet-side, and he resolved not to let them down as he made his way towards an rock formation he had eyed on their flyby. Nestled in it's shadow, lying perfectly still as the dust rolled past him, he peered through the modified electrobinoculars and started imaging the small outpost, consisting of little more than a tower halfway into the rock and a small bunker on it's base. He relayed the encrypted recordings into orbit, suggesting they repel down the cliff face and breach via the towerface just above the sensor package monitoring the surrounding area.
The rest went like clockwork as they landed and infiltrated, and not an opposing soldier in sight as Daz set up the bipod on his rifle, nestling it into his shoulder as started adjusting settings to lessen the dusts restriction of his visibility. His whole body shook as an entirely unexpected explosion erupted in a spray of rocks, dust, and fire that made it completely impossible to see for several seconds. Daz resisted the impulse to move, knowing it would clear by the time he reached a better vantage point anyway, and this impulse was only made worse as blaster fire started to be exchanged in the distance, with only the blurred red lights giving any hint as to where any of the targets were.
Daz Sult knew he could not take a shot until he knew for sure what he was aiming at, and forced himself to ease off the trigger as seconds rolled by with an unstoppable nightmare-slowness that accompanied horrific accidents in progress. He had to know what side to shoot at, and in his panic he elaborated on the subject; He had to know what side he was on. This thought snuck on him like a predator that had been stalking him with inhuman patience and cunning, ready to infect his nerves when he needed them most. It was in that moment that he rationalized that the fire moving away from the safe house was not friendly and with absolutely zero hesitation, leveled his rifle and fired, then fired again, and four more times until the firing stopped entirely. He took a deep breath, and packed up his gear, checking the compass on his survival knife as he went to the extraction point.
He was the only one picked up.
The pilot congratulated him, and handed him a message from Kehlen saying much the same, and including his payment and assurances that he'd be around if Daz should need his expertise. Daz felt completely exhausted and wrestled with his imaginings of what had transpired until he went past it entirely. He had been driven to help people, whether it was to survive or to learn. That was the line of work he had always considered himself to be in, and felt a sense of justice in it, even if morality had never factored into it. If he could help soldiers like those not miss their pick up, he should by all rights. It wasn't grand and a cause much larger than himself, but it was a start as far as he was concerned, and another ten years of mercenary companies, private security, a brief stint assisting an Anzati bounty hunter named Ajku Kelkko with the capture of an escaped Imperial prisoner, and advanced recon and relay would drive home his resolutions on the matter in it's entirety.
He never did find out exactly what happened down there.

</details>

**Description**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Daz Sult stands at 1.63 meters tall and weighs in at 80kg with his lower right black tusk removed completely after a fall drove a hairline fracture down it's entire length, causing him excruciating pain. The shape of his head is slightly less rounded than what one might typically expect of his race, giving him a much more sullen and disturbing appearance of melting to those who see him without his breathing mask in, and he seems to possess and most unnatural stillness when he is waiting. If you talk to him he will make eye contact and keep it until the conversation is completely over, which when coupled with the stillness has been known to creep people out. Regularly wearing folds of gray cloth with a light hood more to offer limited protection from the sun or suns than obscure his features and pants that he meticulously picks for their silence as he walks, there is little else to distinguish him from any other Kel Dor.

Centurion was the name that Tiberias Zann took for himself when he began working as a Defiler for the remnants of the Zann Consortium. Determined to restore the Consortium to its former power, he has trained under Urai Fen and several of the most veteran agents to squire the skills he have. As a Defiler, he bribes, intimidates, blows up and kills competition and rivals to further the Consortium´s cause. As a symbol of the legacy he bears, and the fact that he will one day take over the Consortium, when Urai deems him ready, he wears a modified version of the symbolic red armor of the Defilers, changed in coloring and appearance a bit, and equipped with several technical advances.
The road that lead him to this place was a long one though. Born into the Zann family on Anaxes, Tiberias was always supposed to take a position in the family business, Zann Remanufacturing, and at an early age he started a very extensive education to become a suitable candidate. However, it was soon clear that Tiberias was not meant for that path. He showed an extreme lack of interest in his studies, and often ditched them in order to...well, to do pretty much anything actually, except being there. The only part of his education he really seemed interested in was the parts where he was taught about mechanics and technology, and toured around the main facilities of Zann Remanufacturing. The company is specialized at refitting outdated technology for civilian day use, especially military-grade equipment, something that managed to catch the youngster´s interest.
As he grew up, Tiberias started to do more than just skip classes and show a lack of interest. He started hanging out with the “wrong” people around the streets of Anaxes, and eventually he became involved in a number of businesses of questionable legality. His parents seemed to tolerate this to a moderate amount, but eventually he reached their limit when he tried to deal corporate secrets on the black market. Finally having enough of him, they sent him on what was supposedly a business trip for him to learn on. In secret though, they had advertised a price on Tiberias´s head, and the transport was ambushed as they traveled close to the Vergesso Asteroids.
Striking from hidden positions within the belt, a small number of fighters managed to cripple the ship, and a transport moved in for a boarding action. Severely outgunned and outmanned, Tiberias and the small security crew of the vessel prepared to make their stand. As the hull of the ship was being breached though, a new series of ships emerged from within the field, relentlessly firing on the attackers, obliterating them. However, several attackers made their way on board, and the small security detail was being overrun. A large Togorian made his way towards the front of the line, knocking two guardsmen out of the way with a single sweep of a mighty power hammer, and continued to approach Tiberias.
Not one to frighten easily, Tiberias began to feel despair creeping up his spine, but suddenly the large pirate halted. A large, pointed edge made its way out through his chest, and behind him, the air shimmered. As the Togorian fell to the ground, gurgling, a massive avian creature appeared behind it, holding a set of large blades. Eyes locked in a determined gaze, he gave a small nod towards Tiberias. Then he turned around, and what followed could only be described as a massacre. It was over in a few instants of flashing metal and blurry movements. Then the large avian moved over, and without hesitation grabbed Tiberias and despite the boy´s protests pulled him into one of the small lifeboats on the boarder´s ship, and set out into the Asteroid field.
As they landed aboard an small station deep inside the field, the avian presented himself. He was Urai Fen, an ancient warrior of the Talortai species. More importantly, he was the head of what remained of the Zann Consortium, the criminal syndicate founded by Tiberias´s ancestor, Tyber Zann. Tiberias had heard this name before of course, even though the relations was something his parents had not been very proud of. Fen old him that they had learned that a price was out on the head of the ancestor of Tyber Zann, and he had understood that Tiberias was in danger. He had managed to infiltrate the group of pirates that had planned to make the ambush in the asteroid field, and prepared to take action when necessary.
When suddenly Tiberias asked Urai why he had cared so much, the warrior replied that he had reacted out of instinct, and perhaps some piece of loyalty to Tyber that had remained even after the crimelord´s demise. Then, changing the subject, he asked Tiberias what he planned to do next. Not really sure what to do, Tiberias asked if he could remain with the Consortium. And then we are back at the beginning of our story. Tiberias has taken the role to serve as one of the Consortium´s Defilers, these elite agents capable of a wide range of illegal activities. He is currently sent on a mission by Urai, to test his worth.

</details>

**Appearance** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Most of the time, Tiberias walks in the role of Centurion, agent of the Consortium. When he does, he wears his modified Defiler armor, sporting green and silver markings instead of the red-black design of the old Consortium. Underneath though, he is a well-built human male with a short beard and trimmed, dakr hair. He stands about 1,8 meters tall and weighs a complementary 80 kgs of mainly muscle. If you look at him, the word "thug" will most likely pop into your head

</details>

**Training** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

In addition to the small parts of his education that he actually picked up on, Tiberias has received additional training by Urai Fen and several other Consortium agents. Thanks to this he has become both a skilled marksman and close-combat fighter, as well as a demolitions expert. He has also learned to combine his skills at arms with smooth words, to convince people that seeing his way is really in the best interest for everyone. He also has established a network of agents in the black market, capable of producing a variety of goods under the noses of the authorities.

The GM of course has final say in everything regarding availability, magnitude, and cost of the assistance. This section just illustrates what is available. Also, some of these things may in part be represented by feats and abilities Tiberias possesses, such as the information network, black market connections and some favors he has acquired.
*Troops* – The Consortium still maintains a functioning ground army, though these days it is mostly used to fortify the few remaining palaces the Consortium holds across the Galaxy. Its armed forces includes loyal Defilers, not unlike Tiberias himself, as well as mercenaries recruited from the various corners of the Galaxy, and also a small number of ground units. Given his dislike for the nightsister Silri, Urai Fen cut loose all ties to Dathomir after Tyber´s death, and he has also halted all slave trades the Consortium was once involved in.
*Ships* – While the Consortium fleet is not what it once was, it still remains a functioning assembly if starhips. It retains its solid foundation of Mandalorian crafts such as the StarViper interceptor and the Crusader-class gunship, but local mercenary groups have also added their own craft into it, making it a wide mix of ships.
*Information* – Although shrunk in size and influence, the Zann Consortium upholds a solid information network, spread across the Galaxy. If a certain piece of information is required, it is very likely that it will be produced, the only real question is how long it will take.
*Supplies* – Guerilla warfare with uniqe technological advantages has always been the Consortiums way, and it hasn´t changed one bit. They have contacts with dealers all over the Galaxy, and in several systems they run the black market trading. If something is needed, it can be acquired, though the cost may be steep.
*Urai Fen* – While seldom available to come in person to assist, Urai Fen is still an invaluable ally to Tiberias. The ancient warrior has trained him in close combat, as well as stealth and sabotage. As the leader of the Consortium (at least until he deems Tiberias ready to take over), Urai can command pretty much all of its resources at his will, thus sometimes being able to pull things through that Tiberias cannot do himself. If he can be contacted that is. Urai is an exceptional warrior, and few have been known to be able to stand up to him in battle. Like many Talortai, Urai can feel the currents of the Force, though he has never seemed interested in learning how to manipulate it. Finally, he is a well of historical information. Having lived through one of the Sith Wars, the Galactic Civil War, the Yhuzzan Vong War only to name a few, he has seen quite a bit.

OK folks, I am going to be going over each application indepth today. If you have any last minute changes or additions to make, do so but make them known to me either via PM, find me in the chat, or tap one of the players already in the game and they can shoot me an IM.

I´ll probably sit down a bit and elaborate on my "Resources" section, but it will be nothing that alters the buildup of the character.

All right folks! The votes have been cast, discussions are wrapped up, and deliberations over each application are through. I want to thank everyone for participating, and I want to restate just how great all of these applications were. So great, in fact, that I've decided to expand the casting call to two spots!
I would like to welcome the following players to the game:
**Daz Sult** as played by **Blackhat**
**Jaya Treiden** as played by **Parmenter**
Once again, welcome to the game and good luck... You're going to need it. ;-) I ask that you both hold off on posting your characters to the Dramatis Personae until I've sent you an OK via PM, as we'll have a few more things to discuss and tweak.
For everyone else that applied, I really, really thank you again, and if you have any questions, comments, and/or concerns for me or about the selection process, don't hesitate to send them along.
