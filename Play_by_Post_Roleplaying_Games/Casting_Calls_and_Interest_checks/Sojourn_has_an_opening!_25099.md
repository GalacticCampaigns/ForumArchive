# Sojourn has an opening!

### **master_Tru** (2011-10-06 14:01:46)

That`s right, Star Wars Sojourn has an opening. This game has been running for almost 3 years now, so if you are interested in participating in a long standing game please read on.
*At its height of power the empire has become an almost unstoppable juggernaut of evil. Lead by a tyrannical ruler the emperor has spread evil, chaos and fear across the known galaxy. Times have never been darker.
But there are a few brave soles who would risk everything for freedom. Heroes who would stand against an emperor and against tyranny.
These are tales of adventure and heroics that defy an emperor and his galactic domination.*
Set shortly after the destruction of the first Death Star, this story leads adventurers into the initial stages of the of the Rebel Alliance. Players will take part in freeing the known universe as well as themselves against the power on the empire, do you have what it takes to stand against the emperor?
-Players will start at level 5
-32 point build (plus the ability increase at 4th level)
-1 post a week minimum, additional posts are welcome
You can view the existing players here
[http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=96&amp;t=19780](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=96&amp;t=19780 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=96&amp;t=19780")
The existing players are:
Chase Davion: Human Jedi
Tar`ja: Twi`Lek Soldier/Scout
Naryen Fae: Human Noble/Soldier
Dexter Jessek: Bothan Scoundrel/Scout
That is the easy part. I firmly believe that a good game, dare I say great game`s success depends on the dynamics of the players and characters. That being said this will not be a first come first serve casting call, all submissions will be audited and checked for dynamics. You can submit multiple applications if you choose this would give a broader range of choices to pick from.
Characters must be submitted with not only a description but also a history/background, as well as quotes (what your character concept might say in certain situations). This is what will determine the successful applicant the Star Wars Sojourn. As for now the casting call will stay open for a minimum of 2 weeks, longer if need be.
Some of the upcoming posts you may see in this thread will be from current players. They will be asked to tell a little about the character they are playing.
I look forward to reading over your character ideas, if you have any questions do not hesitate to ask.

I just had some complimentary questions about character creation, and if I don´t ask them, someone else will

* What amount of starting credits do we get?
* What sources (books, web articles, etc) are allowed?
* Hit Points: Max or Average per level?

That´s all I can think of now. I´ll have something up soon, and I´ll try to read up a bit on what´s been going on in the game lately.

Max 1st, depending on the character concept it could be modified.
> **DarthAnthrax wrote:**
>
> [*]What sources (books, web articles, etc) are allowed?

The books I have access to. Suppose I should put a list up for that, when I get home. Rebellion specific obviously.

Max, characters tend to die in games. The chosen applicant will also be required to have a back up character as well.

OK, the concept I originally considered used a number of things (and is planned for a PrC and a few more things) from *Galaxy at War*, and a species from *Force Unleashed*. Is that something that could be ok? It´s mainly the martial arts stuff found in *GaW* I´m after, and maybe a few talents.
It´s a concept I´ve had no luck getting into a lasting game so far, but if you want I can do something else using only the books above.

### **master_Tru** (2011-10-08 08:40:48)

I would need to see the information, in question. Build your concept though I may have to ask for scripted material reference.

A bit about the game.
After three years I'm still enjoying it immensely. The characters all have a level of depth to them that comes from playing for so long.
Even though posting is somewhat on the slow side it still look forward to new posts from everyone. I'd love to see 2-3 posts a week bit it's averaging 1-2.
My character Chase is a young Jedi with some training. This is because his master died just over two years onto his training. He's a bit idealistic and passionate about his path. Which can rub a certain member or members on the team the wrong way. Namely Nayren a former imperial officer.
Chase has recently become involved with one of the others, Tar'ja. Feelings have developed despite great differences between them and their experiences.

> *To tell of Naryen Fae it&#39;s probably best to start with her homeworld of Varbrindal. A large planet with an extensive equatorial city-scape and massive polar glacial regions, it shimmered from orbit like some enormous jewel with the colors of a diverse people adding to it&#39;s brilliance. The history of the Varbrindi is wrought with clan in-fighting and blood feuds with a culture reminiscent of the Norse and Greek of Earth. Eventually the conflicts faded and a more unified people emerged but without a clear purpose. Sport and tradition focused on the polar regions with trials of strength measured by resistance to cold and hardship. &quot;Ice in the veins for clarity of mind.&quot; Sculpting of the ice became the metaphor of shaping a future out of a universe with much the same disposition. Cold hard and unforgiving.
> The first contact with the Old Republic promised a new hope for a people exhausted with old ways of war and the Varbrindi joined with enthusiasm with promises of vision and prosperity for all. Soon the reality of bloated politics inflated with empty promises gave impressions of politicians full of &quot;hot air&quot; and the interest faded with the feeling of a planet whose vote held little weight.
> With the dawn of the new Empire, however, things turned around dramatically. A dynamo of military prowess and pride shone bright in the night and for the first time the Varbrindi were a voice in the galaxy. Promises of prosperity and contribution were offered and met time and again by Emperor Palpatine and the Vabrindi system flourished. From this came Naryen Fae.
> The day she was of age she enrolled in the Imperial Academy on Varbrindi and distinguished herself early and often as officer material. Graduating top of her class she held her head high with pride mirrored in the eyes of her parents and, indeed, her people. She was from an established tradition and her people prospered.
> During her first tour terrorists were, apparently, responsible for an attack against the Wookie citizens on Kashyyk; a horrid contagious hallucinogen that drove the Wookies into blinding rages. With the help of Trandoshian scientists and specialists the population of afflicted Wookies were subdued with minimal losses and treated. Their screams still haunt her dreams.
> After a few more tours of duty her base of operations, the ISD Adjudicator, returned her home just as the planet came under a terrorist attack.
> During the attack on her homeworld the Adjudicator was attacked and the command center destroyed. With no upper command personnel left alive, in system, an obscure general order was enacted to secure Imperial assets. This included firing on civilians that were now seen as a dangerous mob. Sometimes when she closes her eyes she still sees the blank, dead, eyes of her parents, killed by Imperial troopers conditioned to not know what they did.
> Escaping in a civilian transport she now finds herself with a small group of freedom fighters attached to the those same &quot;terrorists&quot; that risked their lives to save as many Varbrindi as they could from Imperial slaughter. Indebted to them she now fights against her own doubts and a system of propaganda and subterfuge bent on the domination of the galaxy and all the beings within.*

As I hope is conveyed in my writing above I have and continue to enjoy this game. Though I too wish the pace was a little faster what we have accomplished, and for so long, is a testament to the creativity and dedication of those involved. I look forward to the submissions and to those that are or will be following this game: Thanks for reading!

I´m sorry this is taking so long Tru. I´ve got a pretty hefty exam today, and a rapport due tomorrow, so I´ve been pretty occupied with that. Though the character is as good as done, so you should expect it perhaps sometime tomorrow night or so.

**Background** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Someth clan Baikh'vair was born on Honoghr in the years leading up to the Clone Wars. Living the quiet life of the Noghri, Someth trained intensively to become as skilled a hunter as many of the elder members of his clan. Warrior people as they were, Noghri warriors fought with their bare hands as weapons, sometimes brandishing daggers or bows, but they took pride in requiring nothing but their bodies to defend themselves. Building an impressive physique, Someth became able to move swiftly and quietly through the forests and jungles, hunting almost any kind of prey, and felling most of them with well-placed assaults, killing them instantly. Like this his life would continue, right up until the Battle of Honoghr.
Ambushing a CIS ship headed for Naboo, carrying a deadly toxin, Republic forces fought a fierce battle over the planet, resulting in the CIS ship crashing into Honoghrs surface, starting to leak its lethal cargo. Someth was one of the hunters sent to deal with any survivors of the crashed ship. The CIS forces never knew what hit them. The battle continued however, as Republic soldiers, commanded by Jedi landed on the planet, seeking to retreive information from the ship. Someth fought alongside his brothers against the intruders, but found himself in a tight spot as he came face to face with the Jedi Aayla Secura. Insted of losing his life however, Someth crashed into a rock wall, severly breaking several ribs and earning a nice set of scars across his body. Unable to continue the fight, he was confined to rest and recovery while the remaining hunters took care of the last enemies. But the worst was yet to come.
Thanks to the leaking poison, Honoghr became a wrecked planet, barely habitable. Survivors by nature, the Noghri would adjust as well as they could, but still, their world was as good as dead. Many years would pass until something would come to change this, and the Noghri would live their own lives, barely aware of the progress of the Galaxy, and in turn their existance would be barely known. Not long after the war ended though, Honoghr would receive a visitor who would forever change its future: Darth Vader. The Dark Warlord of the Empire was most impressed with the battle prowess of the Noghri, and in exchange for using the Empires resources to try and restore Honoghr, Vader earned the loyalty and service of the Noghri. They became the Empires Death Commandos, the private hunters of Darth Vader and the Emperor. As an accomplished hunter and warrior, Someth would join these ranks as well.
After a while, Someth and his team was bestowed the greatest honor one of Vaders servants could be given: To hunt Jedi for the Dark Lord. Imperial Spies had located a lone Jedi Knight, hiding on a remote world on the border of known space. In order to expediate justice, a squad of Noghri assassins were sent to silence the Jedi fo good, Someth among them. He didn´t expect the mission to be a very hard one. After all, he still remembered the successes of his people when the Jedi landed on Honoghr during the war, Yes, a few of the Jedi had survived, and yes he had been scarred for life in the battle, but his wounds had healed, and as he understood it, those Jedi had been something special. His current prey, as per intelligence, was a lone Jedi who had barely acheived knighthood when Order 66 was issued. He would be no match for the Noghri.
While they found the Jedi quickly, the Noghri would fast realize that they had clearly underestimated their foe. It appeared that in his exile, the Jedi had turned to what Someth had heard referred to as the Dark Side of the Force. Unlike the Jedi they had been taught to battle, the Noghri now faced a warrior armed with unexpected powers, and it was soon clear that they were in for the fight of their lives. Crushed to pieces, smashed into walls, and scorched by dark lightning, the assassins fell one by one. But they did take their toll on the fallen Jedi. As Someth rose from a pile of rubble a particularly vile lightning blast had buried him under, he saw the last of his fellow warriors standing drive a dagger deep into the Jedi´s chest. In the next moment, he rose into the air and went limp a cracking sound, and his body was hurled aside. But the Jedi, apparently at his limit, fell to his knees.
Brushing the rubble aside, Someth rose, and a few quick steps brought him to the side of the Jedi. His enemy only looked up at him, and defeat showed in his eyes. Then suddenly something exploded into the Noghri´s head, and the cold in his eyes was replaced by horror, then fury, and finally resolve. With a loud snap, the Jedi´s neck was broken, and Someth turned around and walked away from the battlesite. That was the day he deserted the Empire.

</details>

**Appearance** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Someth have a pretty basic build for a Noghri, with matte gray skin, no hair, and a measurement of only 1,5 meters when standing straight. This small frame, however, is one hundred percent pure muscle, something of which those who try to examine him too closely often get to experience. He is not, however, a very pretty sight to look at, even among Noghri standards. A life of hunting and fighting has left his body scarred in several places, and his last mission for the Empire rendered the left side of his body burnt from face to thigh, giving him quite the grim appearance indeed.
As a result of his burnt and scarred face and body, he usually dresses in a full body covering robe, not unlike the robes worn by Jedi in the past, and he keeps the hood up at most times. Not many people in the Galaxy knows of the Noghri, but those who do seem likely to make the attempt to capture him if they were to recognize him.

</details>

**Personality** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

While Noghri society isn´t particularly harsh or unfriendly, the latter part of Someth´s life have put a serious dent in his personality, in a great many ways. He have developed a very grim and morbid sense of humor, and has no quarrels whatsoever about fighting dirty or killing those who stand in the way of his orders. Also, his manners is as blunt as they come, and he is not one to restrain his speech. He can sometimes seem to retreat into a place of his own as if pondering some big mystery or problem, though he always snap to in situations that calls for his attention.

Nice app DA.
For anyone with multiple character ideas and cannot decide one just one, you can submit more then one app.

Hi, I just activated this account although I had participated quite some time back on here but then had a comp crash some time without a comp and then couldn't remember the name of these forums for some time. I was hoping to be able to jump into a game and see that there is an opening here, and will put together a pc for consideration sometime today or tomorrow if that is okay.

So I have been working up a few basic concepts, to see which character will grow on me and I am currently leaning on a Falleen Noble/Scoundrel utilizing the Lineage Talent tree with Connections and Wealth to represent that a Falleen adventurer would be a priviledged youth. That said I am not sure how you feel as DM about purchasing a starship and droid, or if the group is even in need of a starship. I was thinking of a used Ghtroc 720 Freighter and a RX-series pilot droid to pilot it for me, as I don't feel I should have to perform such a menial task as piloting.

LOL
Nobel`s easily have the resources to acquire a ship of their own. At the moment the players are in need a some form of a pilot, though that will not be the deciding factor for applications.
I would be very interested in reading your background idea for this character, as well as any other character you wish to submit.
Also remember having multiple applications only aids the chosen applicant as all players are required to have backup characters.

Thanks. What isn´t really done yet is his equipment. I was thinking of buying a Personal Energy Shield, like a tool for offering some protection while I close to melee range with opponents. One idea I got though was that since those shields are technically armor, maybe I could trick them out with some of the many upgrade options available to armor, though I figured I should ask how you would feel about that. When I started to think about it, I got a ton of interesting ideas on how to upgrade them, as well as some in-game, technical mumbo jumbo to motivate them <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->
Also, when you said each applicant should have a backup character, did you want us to post them here as well? Because I have one in the works, and I can post it if you like.

### **master_Tru** (2011-10-25 07:18:13)

Stick to standard equipment for now, modified gear can be acquired within adventures. Yes you can post your backup character here.

Oh, I´ll stick with basic gear for now, not that I can afford anything very tricked out anyway. Just wanted to alert you that I see some possibility in playing technogeek with those shields, so that you may ban it right away if you feel like it <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->

**Background** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

1) Xasst finished watching the droids packing his belongings into the Baudo class yacht, barely aware of the conversation occurring behind him nor the disapproving gaze of his uncle bearing into the back of his head. "Shall I have the droids begin unpacking this ship, Xasst? It seems you are not ready for the responsibilities that go along with this traditional rite of passage." The strong grasp on the shoulder of the young Falleen by his uncle, brought him back to the current situation. Xasst looked between the members of House Sizhran, his family, present in the docking bay for his send-off, mindful of the duties that the members of his species and more importantly his family must adhere to. "I am sorry Uncle, Grandfather, members of the esteemed House of Sizhran, it is by no means my intention to dishonor our family in my travels nor any disrespect intended by my actions here in the appearance of my distance while the members present speak." Xasst removed himself from the grasp of his uncle before continuing, "As grandfather was stating, I understand the implications of specifically searching out my mother who disgraced this House. I will make no attempt in locating her." Xasst gazed at his uncle who was giving a small smirk, approving of the young Falleen's ability to be aware of his surrounding even while not paying those surroundings any attention. Grandfather motioned to the members of the House and they began filing out of the docking bay, each motioning thier farewell to the young Falleen about embark on his journeys through the galaxy. The last to remain with Xasst at the ramp of the space yacht was his uncle, he had been the closest to Xasst in his upbringing, more like a father than an uncle. "Xasst enjoy the privilege of these travels. Learn of the places, people, and cultures of the galaxy. Then take those things you learn and come back here to help your people and succeed in your business dealings. If your...no. When your travels bring you to Coruscant, and they will, be sure to visit me at my palace. I shall make sure you will receive a grand reception."
2) "Coruscant. That shall be my next stop, it has been almost a year since I left Falleen, last saw uncle. His invitation for a visit would be a major step up after this backwater planet. I wonder if Aala would consider joining me for that visit. Although I am unsure if uncle would approve of my bringing a Twi'lek smuggler to his palace", as Xasst thought these things a smile crossed his face, "especially as she is not a member of Black Sun." Xasst rose out of the bed of the modest inn which he was currently staying wondering when the beautiful Twi'lek woman would be returning from meeting with her freedom fighter clients. "I know it is a dangerous business dealing with those who oppose the Empire, but a smuggler must make ends meet, and ships do not fuel themselves," Aala had told him just yesterday in the docking bay he was paying for where her Ghtroc freighter, the Sal'kaasa Pride, and his Baudo class yacht were being housed. The fiery and passionate nature of the Twi'lek smuggler was one of the reasons spending these last three months with her so enjoyable and memorable, her beauty also helped in that regard though he admitted to himself.
The atmosphere was suddenly jostled by the physical rumblings and loud noise of an explosion, causing Xasst to quickly get to his feet and make his way out of the room and towards the street below. From the street level Xasst could see the local residents fleeing from the south end of the town as well as the smoke from the small warehouse that the Falleen knew to be the location of the rendezvous that Aala was currently attending. "Aala!" Xasst gasped, running against the tide of the fleeing locals attempting to get to the woman who has come to mean so much to him uncharacteristically putting his personal safety aside. Xasst could see an Imperial Assault Shuttle landing just past the location of the warehouse, most likely having just bombarded the location on it's way to landing. Xasst knew that at any minute a number of stormtroopers would be pouring out of the shuttle and eliminate any chance of securing Aala's survival if she was not already dead. Xasst acted quickly and pushed over a stack of crates hiding a secret door to the warehouse, which incidentally caused a domino effect resulting in a street light crashing into the landing shuttle causing it to suddenly lurch to the left and veer into a small home. As Xasst snuck through the hidden door, he hoped the accident would buy him the few extra moments needed to find his Twi'lek companion and secure her escape. "Aala! Where are you," yelled Xasst attempting to search through the smoke and chaos filled room for any semblance of Aala or any movement. "Help.." Xasst heard a small voice coming from his immediate left and tore through the wreckage to get to it. When Xasst lifted a beam that had knocked over a number of crates he saw movement just behind them, hopes raised he called again. "Aala, it is Xasst can you hear me? I am coming." What Xasst saw next removed all the breath from his lungs, fore in front of him lay the body of Aala cradled in the arms of a human male with long greying hair and mustache. "Aala...," Xasst knelt on the ground before his fallen paramour, pulling her from the grasp of the strong male holding her. "I am sorry son," muttered Garm Bel Iblis releasing his grasp to allow Xasst to take Aala from him. Xasst looked over Aala's wounds and from the midst of his daze stated, "my ship. medical droid. i can save her." Bel Iblis reached for Xasst as he began to lift the corpse of the Twi'lek smuggler, "Son, any moment a squadron of Stormtroopers will be bursting in here. You will be obliterated just carrying her out of here. The only way out is to fight our way out. My people are hurt too, we can use you son. Do it for her."
Xasst stared a hole straight through the elder gentleman, "This was not HER fight! This is not my fight! This was a business transaction for her and she was pulled into YOUR war. I'm taking Aala to get her the medical help she needs and leave through the secret door I came in. Those Stormtroopers you are making these wounded fools wait for and fight crashed outside and are delayed, flee now and fight your fool's fight another day. I care less!" With that Xasst hauls Aala's body up and makes his way back out the secret back door, pausing only momentarily when he hears Bel iblis call out to him, "You already know it is too late for her don't you son? The Empire killed my wife and family, just as they did her. Whatever you may believe Aala's reason for being here, know that she believed in this cause. She sold us the supplies we needed at cost with no profit for herself. She was a true believer in freedom and she will be missed. I am sorry for your loss, son." As Xasst begins to move again he called back to Garm Bel Iblis, "Your people could use medical help as well, they can hide in the docking bay my ship is in and see what my medical droid can do for them."
Two hours later as Xasst sat at a small table outside a small tavern across from the docking bay his ship resided in, sipping a Hapan Gold Wine while reading a journal found in Aala's Ghtroc 720. The passion with which she wrote of the plight of so many under the rule of the Empire, clearly showed that her runs made for the supplies of these rebels was something important to her. The RX-series pilot that flies Xasst's Baudo yacht, Captain Rucks came hovering towards the Falleen nobleman, "Sir. Word just came in that all ships leaving the planet must pass inspection from the Imperial forces. Those visitors you brought us will not be able to leave this planet. They are sure to be found out, Sir." Xasst looked up from the journal and the droid, "Is the Senator aware of this predicament, Captain?"
"You are aware that there is a Star Destroyer up there Senator, correct?" Xasst stated as he crossed the hangar. Bel Iblis looked at the Falleen male as he came towards him, droid hovering in tow. The Corellian man replied, "So you are aware of who I am?" Xasst stopped as he reached the legendary Senator, he began speaking again to the Corellian, "Yes of course I am aware of who you are Sir, I am well studied in the goings on of the galaxy and the movers and shakers within. What I am unaware of though is how you think you are going to fight your way off this planet. Those people you brought, they are someone else's Aala's. Be it their lover, mother, sister, brother, father, or friend. You will throw those lives away if you attempt to flee the planet with firepower." Eyebrow raised, Garm Bel Iblis scrutinized the Falleen male before questioning, "You seem as if you have another idea in mind?"
The Baudo class space yacht registered to House Sizhran of Falleen left the planet, the Imperial Star Destoyer allowed it to pass unquestioningly. The credentials of the owners being what they were.
3) Two weeks after the incident at the warehouse Xasst watches as the last of the supplies he ordered are loaded onto the Gthroc 720 freighter. Captain Rucks approaches the Falleen male papers in his droid hand, "Sir the new registration papers have come through. The re-christened Aala's Dream has been given clearance to leave. On another note, the local constable stated that there is still no word in regards to your stolen yacht." The smirk across the face of Xasst betrays the feigned shock of his answer, "Alas my poor ship, I have no idea how brigands could have broke in to the docking bay and stolen my prized ship. Luckily most of my belongings and my loyal droids were all off the ship at the time."
"Well Captain, I believe it is time for us to be going. This planet no longer holds my interest." As the RX-series pilot made it's way to the cockpit he called to Xasst, "Shall I begin setting a course for Coruscant then Sir?" "No Captain Rucks. Let's find ourselves a Rebellion to join."

 **Appearance**  <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Xasst is a tall muscular Falleen with green, scaly skin and long black hair pulled back in a ponytail. Xasst is normally seen wearing fine clothes, appropriate for one of his background. The young Falleen is also often seen reading from a datapad or text, mostly in regards to various planets and their social structures and politics.

</details>

 **Personality**  <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

As many of his species of Xasst's age, the Falleen is prone to feelings of vast superiority and arrogange. An encounter on a remote world in the Outer Rim has brought some hubris to Xasst. But while he has grown in his consideration for others, Xasst maintains the demeanor of the priveleged noble he is supposed to be.

## Katriana DiSabato

### **Alicia** (2011-10-26 17:42:40)

</div>

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Katriana DiSabato</span>**
Female Human 26
Noble 5 ((This isn't set in stone, but here's a general idea of abilities))
**Talents** Bolster Ally, Noble Fencing Style, Wealth
**Feats**  Linguist, Skill Focus (Mechanics, Treat Injury), Surgical Expertise, Tech Specialist, Weapon Proficiency (pistols, simple) (1 level unassigned)
**Skills** Deception, Knowledge (galactic lore), Knowledge (life sciences), Knowledge (technology), Mechanics, Perception, Persuasion, Treat Injury, Use Computer
**Brief Background:** Katriana was young when the Grand Chancellor declared the formation of the Galactic Empire and made himself the de facto Emperor of the new regime. Her father, Thomas, was a Republic naval officer and while the transformation didn't sit well with him he pledge his loyalty mostly to protect his family. One day when Katriana was seven years old Imperial soldiers raided her home and violently took her father and little brother away. At the same time her mother, Marie, as well as Katriana were left for dead. Fortunately her family retained a decent portion of their wealth and with the help of an old family friend they were safely transported to another world.
Marie returned to the planet of her birth in the Tapani sector where she met a noble of House Reena and they were soon married. It was through her stepfather Lord Galen Shaffield the young Katriana was able to gain her vast medical and technological knowledge and training. Though her teen years were influenced dramatically by the culture and whims of the other Tapani nobles Katriana never forget about the atrocities inflicted by the Empire when she was younger. Using her resources and knowledge to her advantage she has searched for clues as to what has happened to her father and brother.
Leaving the safe confines of her home, she begins to explore various outposts in her quest. Eventually her search drew the attention of the Rebellion and they recruited her to their cause.
**Description:** Standing proudly at 5'6" this human woman, who appears to be in her late twenties, is dressed in a long sleeved, tasteful garment of Tapani silk. She wears her long, light red hair in an up-do. During her travels she wears more appropriate garments with the tools of her trade displayed on her utility belt, though on closer examination it is not to hard to imagine she is a noblewoman. Her blaster pistol is rarely drawn as she prefers to talk her way out of disagreements rather than fight, but that hardly means she doesn't know how to use it.

## Shi'tal Bralor

### **Alicia** (2011-10-26 18:28:17)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Shi&#39;tal Bralor</span>**
Female Human 17
Soldier 2 / Scout 3; Str 13, Dex 18, Con 13, Int 14, Wis 10, Cha 10
**Talents** Acute Senses, Devastating Attack (rifles), Keen Shot
**Feats** AP (light, medium), Martial Arts I, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Shake it Off, Weapon Focus (rifles), WP (pistols, rifles, simple)
**Skills** Endurance, Gather Information, Perception, Pilot, Treat Injury, Use Computer
**Brief Background:**
Shi'tal's mother, Vanessa, was born and raised on Coruscant and having fallen in love with the the seemingly brutish Mandalorian Jaster Bralor, an established starship designer, abandoned her home and family to follow him to the Mandalorian world of Concord Dawn where they would establish a farm. A peace loving man at heart, and loving and caring father, he would often bring home orphaned children from the worlds he traveled to. While Vanessa loved all the children her husband brought to her to care for, she was desperate to conceive a child of her own. Finally, six years into their marriage and after several miscarriages she got her wish.
Growing up amidst the numerous adopted orphans, Shi’tal had to compete with them for her father’s attention. Not being technologically inclined like her father, she managed to catch the attentions of her uncle Antos, a trained bounty hunter, and began to learn the trade from him. Discovering an aptitude for capturing their targets without severely harming them.
It was during a mission for an Imperial captain things went seriously wrong for the young Mandalorian and her mentor. Hired to capture an enemy of the captain's, they discovered the contract was more they could handle together. Even after having set a trap for their target, Antos came out of the mission severely wounded and their target near dead. Returning with their bounty, the young and naive Shi’tal hoped the captain would provide medical assistance to her uncle as part of their reward, but instead they were sent on their way. Unable to get adequate treatment in time for Antos, Shi’tal was helpless but to watch has he died.
Full of vengeance towards the captain who had allowed her uncle to die, she seeks out the Rebellion hoping to one day find and have her revenge.
**Description:** Though she is young, appearing no more than seventeen years, she seems to carry the mantle of responsibility placed on her well. Her armor is of an unusual design, made of a strong metal which could theoretically stop a lightsaber. It's only distinguishable feature is the T shaped visor on the helmet, otherwise it could pass as a form of regular light armor. Those who know of the Mandalorians would know the armor as a declaration of what she is. The sight of the armor and the large blaster rifle slung across her back is a sure mark to not antagonize her.
Underneath her helmet, Shi’tal has long reddish brown hair which is braided into a long plait she can tuck into her helmet and her brown eyes look on with a sharp intelligence. She stands near the average height of 5'5" and though she looks lightweight, she is stronger than she appears.
Sensitive about her youth, she’ll do whatever she can to prove that it’s not a factor. Used to competing to get her way, she doesn’t shy away from a challenge. While she was once free-spirited, the death of her uncle Antos weighs heavily on her and at times she seems to withdraw into heself.

### **SQuigley316** (2011-11-01 16:03:35)

So for my backup character there are two stories that are battlilng out in my mind to be the winner. First is Sullustan Scoundrel Elon Sund, who left his family for giving up his twin sister to be trained as a Jedi who died as a Padawan, Elora Sund. The second is an exiled Chiss, Che Omineawa (Ch'omnnnw'aea in Cheunh) who is pretending to be a Pantoran noble. Decisions decisions. One shall be victorious and posted sometime tomorrow.

One of the characters Squig is thinking as a backup has a sister that was taken to be a Jedi.

### **SQuigley316** (2011-11-01 23:28:41)

The Sullustan character is intended to be straight Scoundrel class, no levels of Jedi. I intended him to be the brother of a Jedi Padawan that died at the Battle of Jabiim in 21 BBY from issues 56 and 57 of Star Wars: Republic, not a Force Sensitive or Jedi himself. Just wanted to give him a reason in his background to fight the Empire so he would be against the Imperial Order as it brought down the Jedi.
It may be a moot point anyway as in the battlefield of my mind having to roleplay a Chiss, who are not really known of in this Era in the known galaxy besides in a very small circle (Thrawn), who us constantly needing to cover his tracks by pretending to be a Pantoran and the varied complications that would come with that. Roleplaying a character that is basically roleplaying a character.

**Background** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Born as a shadow child of his Chiss family in 22 BBY,Ch'omnnnw'aea was raised on Crustai as a normal member of Chiss society. Unhappy with his circumstances of not being a formal member of his family, Ch'omnnnw'aea left his home and people in 9 BBY to make his own path in the galaxy. Knowing the importance of the Chiss people's regard for the secrecy of their existance, Ch'omnnnw'aea adopted a new name of Che Omineawa and posed as a member of Pantoran heritage to explain the blue hue of his skin. Che Omineawa traveled around the Outer and Mid-Rim worlds for a few years enjoying his travels when he crossed paths with a landing party on the planet Averam led by Moff wilhuff Tarkin himself. Knowing of the existance of the Chiss people through his association with Grand Admiral Thrawn, both being in the innermost circle of Emperor Palpatine's government, Tarkin believed that Ch'omnnnw'aea was a spy of Thrawn's Phalanx and attempted to have him shot on sight. Fleeing the Stormtroopers under Tarkin's command Ch'omnnnw'aea escaped after a stray blaster bolt missed him and killed a nearby Toydarian merchant. Holding a grudge for the incident against Tarkin and his people Che decided to use his knowledge and superior genetics to aid those who oppose the Empire.

</details>

 **Appearance**  <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Che Omineawa is a tall muscular Chiss with blue skin and short blueish black hair. Che dresses in normal Pantoran noble garb, his appearance in general is very consistant with that of a normal Pantoran. The only odd characteristic about Che is that he has red glowing eyes, which he states is as the cause of his being an outcast of his Pantoran people.

</details>

 **Personality**  <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Che Omineawa is a very knowledgable and charismatic individual. He is closed off in regards to his past but quick with statistical or facts about a vast number of subjects.

</details>

At some point I will expand on the background story of the character as it is still forming in my head but I wanted to get this up as a backup character was part of the initial request for consideration
