# Shadowrun Anyone?

### **Valheru** (2010-06-20 18:32:38)

So I picked up Street Magic the other day and have really been itching for a Shadowrun game. Would anyone be interested in playing? There's pretty much a whole campaign available for free called Shadowrun Missions that I could run. However, if people interested have already played through Missions I’ll see what else I can come up with.
If you’re unfamiliar with Shadowrun it’s a gritty sci-fi/fantasy blend set in the dystopian near future. Magic and cyberware are commonplace as are elves, orks, and trolls. The player characters are Shadowrunners, elite illegal operatives who undertake a variety of missions, from corporate espionage and extractions (whether the target is willing or not) to good old fashioned wet work. The website has a free primer on the system [http://www.shadowrun4.com/quickstart/](http://www.shadowrun4.com/quickstart/ "http://www.shadowrun4.com/quickstart/").

Excellent! I'll get a casting call up as soon as possible, which will probably mean Thursday but could be Wednesday.
Magical I'll be happy to help you (and anyone else) with character generation if you can't find any pdfs. The primer will at least let you refresh on the rules.

4th Edition, they've got several new books out now but all you really need is the core rule book. If you're looking at buying a new book you may wish to purchase the SR4 Anniversary Edition instead. There's a couple of changes but for the most part it's simply clarifications and adding stuff from other source books. I don't have SR4A but there is a free update guide on the website so if some of you have SR4A we can use those rules instead. Otherwise we'll just use the base SR4 for ease of use. I don't really forsee it being a problem either way.
I've never played the previous editions of the game so I don't know how much has changed. You might be able to just look at the quick start rules (at the above mentioned link) instead of buying a book. However the year is 2070 now and the setting has gone through some fairly major events. Unfortunately the quick start rules have precious little fluff but perhaps you can find that info online. Of course if Magical manages to find some pdfs this would all be moot...:P
