# [Leg] Tales from a Dark Age (Open)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-17 17:55:16)

*If he had known what waited in the future, Obi-Wan might not have been too quick to name the aftermath of the Clone Wars "The Dark Times"…
Once again, the Galaxy has been cloaked by a veil of utter darkness, and the power of the Dark Side can be felt everywhere. The One Sith, ruled by the iron fist of Darth Krayt, has seized control of the Empire, and sent the former emperor Roan Fel into exile. Rebuilding and reorganizing, Krayt have returned the Empire to the same power it enjoyed under Palpatine´s rule, and his Sith have once again hunted the Jedi to near extinction. The only threats to his power, are Fel´s Empire-in Exile, and the remnant of the Galactic Alliance Fleet, and the struggle have placed the Galaxy in a state of Civil War. Martial law keeps the systems of the Empire in line, and criminal activity thrives in the shadows of war, as the authorities often cannot be bothered with (or are in alliance with) the forces of the underworld.
In these times, those who dwell in the shadows finds an environment to their liking, but they better be ready to play the game, for in the shadows only the law of the jungle is in effect. However, in these times of darkness and evil, even a single light can shine brightly, and it shall be known that the need for heroes are great.
Welcome to the shadows…*
Okay, that was my attempt at an introduction to this campaign. It is really more of a general description of the state the Galaxy is in though, and a brief feel of the mood I will be aiming for. That last sentence was my way of saying that you can play anything you want, be it hero or villain. The campaign time will be a short time into the Second Imperial Civil War. What I am going for is the period before the Empire-in-Exile joins forces with the remnant of the GA fleet. I am far from an expert on the Legacy era, but I will assume canon has been followed, and will be followed, unless your actions would cause that to change <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> . If someone who has more experience with the period (say, someone who has actually read the comics) can input if I make fact errors ot something similar, that would be appreciated.
Now, for the premises of character creation:
**Level** Characters start at level 5. You can always ask to start at a different level in case you want to play a more/less powerful hero, but I like the concept of starting out "small" and then growing in power.
**Sources** Any and all books can be used, though I will not allow homebrew materials unless I can take a good look at it first. Certain things might be banned though, depending on era appropriateness and common sense, but this mainly concerns species and equipment.
**Point Buy** 36 (32 for droids)
**Hit Points** Take max each level, I want to be able to challenge you <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
**Background/Destiny** Destiny. This campaign is about individuals, and destinies just works much better for that purpose.
**Credits** Characters starts with max credits for their class. I can be reasoned with if you want a specific piece of equipment vital to your concept, I just don´t want to hand out too much cash to start with.
**Equipment** I will be using rules for encumbrance and weapon licensing, so either make sure weapons are licensed or be prepared to hide them. This will include starting equipment as well as equipment acquired later, though you may assume you have passed all required checks and paid all license fees for starting equipment.
**Starting Off** Since this campaigns is supposed to be about you, I´d like some input as to where we kick things off. Include a short section in your background as to where the character is at the moment, what he is doing there, and so on.
Well, I think that´s it for now. If you have any questions, or if I have forgotten something important, just speak up.

Max credits from level 1 for level 5 characters? I hope you'll allow for some special considerations for concept based equipment.
Anyways.. I'll have my concept build up here in a bit. Working with Dave some on a bit of background between Jakira and Wes to lead them away from Tapestry.

**Backround**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jakira grew up the daughter of a cybernetics surgeon and a nurse. While she was never expected to follow her family into medicine her parents took advantage of her growing interest in the profession to keep their daughter out of trouble. Learning the trade from an early age from her parents clinic her passion for the healing arts only grew. Attending a prestigious medical school she quickly rose to the top of her class and upon graduation was accepted to work in a hospital on Coruscant. Accepting the offer she spent her internship there. In secret she craved to learn more about the bio-implants the Vong had introduced to the galaxy and sought out someone to teach her. When her parents decided to retire from their lucrative business and move to a more remote area of their homeworld, Zeltros, they offered the clinic to Jakira. With the Darth Krayt's Empire frimly entrenched on Coruscant and her home steadily becoming an unbearbly bleak place she took the offer gladly.
Leaving the hospital on Bastion, Jakira returned to the the clinic where her passion had grown and began the management of her family's business. Cajoling a reputable doctor to join her, she allowed him to handle most of the patients while she managed the office. With a good deal of her time now free, she continued in her extracurricular learning. After a year she sold the clinic taking her earnings to start up a new clinic on Solsis VII. Moving there she knew she was in for some hard times. The backwater planet was just emerging, but with her hospital being amoung the first to sprout up on the Sith subjugated planet the natives came to depend on the services she provided. Using the hospital as a front, she worked on helping as many of the Force Sensitive Hobben's to escape from the Sith's grasp.
With the arrival of Feeorin's captian Kurr's No Chance leading a vindictive Sith Assassin unawares to the hapless planet, events would turn against the young Zeltron doctor. As the injured Wes took refuge in the hospital as he recovered from his ordeals after being revived from hibernation, the assassin tracked the ship to the planet and subsequently to the sanctuary of the hospital. During the night, the Sith Assassin with the help of the local Sith governor attacked the hospital in search of Wes and the oboulette the Mandalorian warrior had been confined in for centuries. The Hobben leaders, hiding in the catacombs of the temple turned hospital managed to escape into the vast jungles of Solsis with the obilette and the crew of the No Chance, Jakira, and any straggling Hobben they managed to find.
The group spent the next week hiding in the hazardous jungles, dodging Sith and the fauna equally. Taking refuge in the grove of sacred San'ati, the Force Senstive Hobben leaders made their stand, forming the Pure Song, their spirits combined in the Force and with their combined strength was able to overcome the Sith assassin. Sacrificing themselves, most of the Hobben Elders passed into the Force, as well as the Voice of Ali'la and Jakira's greatest friend, Mahchen. With their recent adversary defeated, the crew of the No Chance fights their way past the remaining Sith garrison under the leadership of Governor Radge Rothke. Now wanted by the Sith governor on his own vendetta, Jakira leaves the planet, albeit unwillingly, she had come to call home.

**Description**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jakira is 25 years old and sports a dark crimson skin tone with light pink almost white hair. Generally her stylishly cut, shoulder length hair is hanging free, but she's been known to pull it back with a hair tie she wears as a bracelet when the need arises. Wearing a skimpy, tight fitting top, she uses her appearance and the allure of her people to her advantage. When the time arises for her to work, she has a smock which covers her to her knees. To a casual observer she carries no weapons, though a hold-out blaster is tucked securely in one of her high boots.
Being jovial and sometimes even flippant, Jakira has learned over the years how to manipulate people when it suited her. Though she is rather promiscuous and can be a player, she becomes very serious when there are people in need of her help.

Ah yes, I suppose I thought that fell under the "ask a question" clause, but I think I´ll make a note of it as well. I´m not at all impossible when it comes to giving away concept based equipment, such as a Mandalorian´s armor, a bounty hunter´s ship, or a war veteran´s trusted sidearm. I just don´t want to give you too much credits to run around with. If you want something in this game, you´ll have to work for it.
Also (which will also be added to the original post), when you write your characters background, it would be nice if you could include a short paragraph that specifies more exactly what your character is doing right now at the moment, just so I have some idea where to kick your campaign off at. It doesn´t have to be long, but stuff like where the character is, for what purpose, and similar things can be useful.

**Background:**
On a Galactic Alliance planet that he didn't even know the name of, his Clan was contracted out to hold a facility while GA military evacuated personnel and civilians. Why the civilians were there Wes had no idea. They should not have been in the middle of a war zone. Something about scientists but Wes had no use for scientists.
Communications were out. Ionization in the atmosphere drastically reduced the range of communications. Wes was holding position watching for any Vong. The optics in his helmet provided him with excellent visibility in the near dark area.
"Buir, you think the Vongese will come this way." Wes said to his Father over the helmet comms.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Buir = father / Vongese = Vong

</details>

His father didn't say anything. All Wes saw was the nod of the helmet his father wore.
The other armored warrior in the room spoke. Wes heard her voice over his helmet comms. "Let them come. Ib'tuur jatne tuur ash'ad kyr'amu." Wes smiled though no one saw it. For his mother spoke the truth. For even through they were only three. Three Mandolorian warriors were equal to a platoon of GA troopers.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ib'tuur jatne tuur ash'ad kyr'amur = Today is a good day for someone else to die.

</details>

Wes shifted the environmental controls that regulated his armor kicked on. Providing cooled air to offset the hot environment outside.
"Ad'ika, run the perimeter." He heard his father say. Wes clicked his comm. to signal that he heard and understood.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ad'ika = lad, boy

</details>

Wes ran the outlying perimeter. At the extreme range of his comlink, where he could still barely reach his parents due to the diminished signal, he got the call they the Vongese were advancing on his parent's position. Wes commed for help relaying the position of the attacking force to the GA personnel. And with best possible speed made his way back. He hadn't gone more than ten feet when the first thud bug hit his helmet. His armor, which was his life, protected him from that hit and the others at followed.
His blaster carbine answered back. His first shot took the lead Vongese in the head and the warrior fell forward head first into the soil. The dust cloud, that the body's impact raised, was quickly swept away buy the warriors second and third companions as they rushed past their fallen comrade.
Wes gave them credit. Most would have paused from seeing that but the Vongese were warriors like him. He had a fight on his hands. The smile beneath his helmet, if the Vongese could have seen it, would have given them pause.
The battle between them raged. Wes tried to contact the others but his comm. fizzled out due to the ionization or damage. The second warrior dropped to several shots but the last was in close now. Amphistaff and armor collided. The living weapon continually tried to find a way past the dense Mando armor.
Wes managed to finally get an armored hand around the warrior's neck. Through repeated bludgeoning with the other hand the Vongese finally lay still. Wes rolled off the dead body. His black and gray armor was covered with his enemys blood.
Standing he made his way back to the position his parents were holding. The sound of battle could still be heard. Quickening his pace even more he arrived on scene. The place was crawling with GA troopers and Vongese in a pitched battle. Seeing the intense melee Wes entered it his blaster carbine firing away. He went through his remaining power packs. By the time the last Vongese dropped Wes was nearly out of ammunition.
The adrenaline of battle still surged within him as he looked for his parents. What shocked him was that they were nowhere to be seen. What he saw when he did find them nearly made the battle hardened Mando retch. His father lay dead fallen over the still body of his mother. Both had pieces of armor missing. Part of his father's breastplate was mission and his mother's helmet was off. Her cause of death was obvious, massive trauma to the head. Around them lay more than a dozen dead Vongese warriors, a testament to their courage in battle.
When all was said and done, payment was received Wes left the planet with his parents. He took them home to Mandalore where they received a warriorâ€™s funeral.
The war was soon over. With noting to keep him on Mandalore he left. He felt as if he didn't belong there with his clanmates. Not then, maybe never.
-----------------------------------
It didn't take long for Wes to find a job. Some old human on a back water planet needed some help dealing with some pirates that had been harassing him for several months. It seemed to be an easy enough job. Kill a few pirates make some credits to afford a few more modifications to his armor. Then move on to the next job. It all changed when he arrived and talked to the old man.
"Thank you for coming Mr. Del-Fin. The job I requested you for is most important." The man seemed almost too old to be living. Something about the man was unnerving though. As if he didn't need help in dealing with any trouble that may come his way.
Wes simply stood there all the old man could see was his own reflection off the armored helmet. "Yes I know you've been bothered by some pirates. I know how to deal with them." He moved the blaster carbine that always at his side.
The old man smiled. "Yes I am sure that you do. But I have seen something that is disturbing. Something in the future that will come to pass, help there you can. You have an ability that is as of yet unrecognized...they will need you."
As the man spoke a ominous shiver ran down Wes's spine. *What in karking hell is he talking about? He's daft.* Wes thought as he took a step back. Something he had never done to another person before. The old man continued.
"Yes you will be needed." Sensing some sort of danger Wes began to raise his carbine. But the old man moved quicker. If his eyes were visible disbelief would have been seen in his eyes. Wes felt himself begin to loose consciousness. Fighting against it he stumbled to a table in the sparse room. Unable to fight it any longer he slumped over the table. The weight of the man and the armor crushed the table and he fell to the floor.
The old man shuffled up to the fallen Mando a look of grim sadness on his face. "I am sorry my young friend. If things were different I would have trained you myself. Now someone else will have to find that potential that you hold. But alas that will be many years from now.
Wes was removed from his armor and taken to the lower levels of the old mans dwelling. He was placed carefully in a chamber. "Here you will sleep for the next century young Wes. When you awaken you will be needed. Live up to your heritage and your destiny and become a Jedi."
-------------------------------
With the arrival of the No chance on Solsis IIV the group thought they had found a place to lay low and effect repairs on ship that had just been acquired by the pirate Kurr. As the injured Wes took refuge in the hospital as he recovered from his ordeals after being revived from hibernation, the Sith assassin fron the Wheel tracked the ship to the planet and subsequently to the sanctuary of the hospital. During the night, the Sith Assassin with the help of the local Sith governor attacked the hospital in search of Wes and the oboulette the Mandalorian warrior had been confined in for centuries. The Hobben leaders, hiding in the catacombs of the temple turned hospital managed to escape into the vast jungles of Solsis with the obilette and the crew of the No Chance, Jakira, and any straggling Hobben they managed to find.
The group spent the next week hiding in the hazardous jungles, dodging Sith and the fauna equally. Taking refuge in the grove of sacred San'ati, the Force Senstive Hobben leaders made their stand, forming the Pure Song, their spirits combined in the Force and with their combined strength was able to overcome the Sith assassin. Sacrificing themselves, most of the Hobben Elders passed into the Force. With their recent adversary defeated, the crew of the No Chance fights their way past the remaining Sith garrison under the leadership of Governor Radge Rothke. Now hunted by the Sith governor on his own vendetta, the group leaves the planet that had hoped to find a little bit of sanctuary on.
A week later the No Chance set down on a mid rim world to take on some supplies. With Wes, Jakira and Kurr grating on each others nerves till they were raw. It was a welcome thought to get off the ship for a while so Wes and Jakira left the ship to take a walk alone. Unbeknown to them pirate had other plans and pulled up the boarding ramp leaving the pair behind. Stranded Jakira did what she does best and finds them a place to say and relax in each others company for a while.
**Personality:**
Wes is a loner Mandalorian to the core. Since the death of his parents he hasn't worked with anyone else. Their death hit him hard as he blames himself. He should have been there. His loyalty to the paying client is never in question. As long as they pay he will work. Credits are credits.
**Appearance:**
Wes is almost always in his armor. The black, gray and red tones are colors of the Del-Fin clan, which he wears proudly. At almost 6'4" in his armor he poses an intimidating figure. The blaster carbine, which is always in hand, further impresses the picture of the Mandalorian warrior. Under the armor one would find a man a few inches shorter then the armored one. Short brown hair and matching brown eyes that are difficult to read. His skin tone is relatively light due to wearing the armor most of the time.

Understandable. You are open to the thought of him pursuing training with the Force though I hope? That was the premise of the character after all.

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

For millenia, the off-shoots of the Arkanians have been oppressed and abused by their creators. Though there are sympathizers in the populace of Arkania, it's never amounted to enough to overturn popular opinion of the half-breeds. Even on a genetic level it seemed the Arkanians were programmed to suppress their creation.
Jaya Treiden, born to a pure-blood mother and off-shoot father, shares no genetic traits with her father. In all appearances she is a pure Arkanian. Though, going through school, it showed that she possessed a drive unlike others her age. Possibly, the drive to succeed programmed into the off-shoots. Because of her lineage, Jaya's life was void of friendship, outside her parents. This left her plenty of time to study, and create friends using her imagination.
In the years the followed Off-shoot anger for their masters continually grew, climaxing in a revolution that engulfed the planet. Fearing for their safety, Jaya's parents booked passage off-world. However, only Jaya made it on-board as her parents were consumed by the mob scene at the starport.
Without guidance and support Jaya traveled around the galaxy, often as a stow-away, learning to steal what she needed to survive. One ship she stowed upon had been doing recon work for a group of pirates known as the Wyverns. Brought back to their base, she was left with no other option than to convince them of her use and hope for mercy. The pirate leader, a Chiss, saw potential in her as she was both useful as a mechanic, and also a plant on whatever target they decide to hit, using her to disable the target from the inside.
For nearly five years she plundered with the pirates, roaming wild space, and striking targets in the outer rim as war still consumed the galaxy. Her departure from the group happened abruptly when the ship she stowed upon, managed to escape to hyperspace before being boarded. She fears return to the pirates will be met with punishment as she would likely be blamed for the ship's escape.
Again, without family or friends, Jaya makes her way through the universe, using what talents she possesses to survive.

</details>

**Description**
Jaya Treiden is a 17 year old Arkanian female. Her white hair is braided tightly into a long tail down her back falling nearly to her knees. Though her clothes are rather common, her appearance gives her an air of a dilettante roaming the galaxy.

OK, I´ve been looking over the sent in applications, and things looks good. Mainly there were a few things in Yogi´s character, otherwise everything was ok.
**Jakira**

* If you could structure your sheet according to the guidelines I posted, I would appreciate it. Namely, make sure it is clear where stuff like the Medpacs and MDS-50 is kept. It takes you an additional Move action to retrieve them if they are in the Medical Kit (a backpack-style container) instead of the Utility Belt. Might not seem like a big deal, but sometimes it could be important.

**Wes**

* It seems like you should know one more language.
* Your Reflex Defense seems to be 1 high.
* Finally, you´re going to have to ditch a lot of your equipment and/or the modifications to it. You can have the Beskar'gam without extra cost, as it´s part of your concept, but I can hardly see how a Superior Damage mod to your carbine has any impact on your concept. From what I can calculate, you have 1720 Cr left after buying all equipment unmodified. I can promise you though that there will be plenty of opportunities to earn money, or in other ways obtain equipment in this game.

**Jaya**

* Same thing as I said to Alicia, plus your blaster pistol isn´t even listed under equipment. I nearly forgot you had it.
* Also, it seems like you would have 315 Cr left after subtracting all equipment, including weapon licenses (not sure if you wanted them licensed).

Finally, I have a question about your destinies. Two of three have named a special destiny, and I´m curious if you had any ideas in mind, or if you just chose that Destiny since the bonus looked good. As always I have my own plans brewing in the background, but input is always accepted.

Yeah blaster was a last minute addition forgot to add it. I thought connections would take care of licenses.
Destiny was because of its bio I felt she could be a freedom fighter if put in the right situation but I'm willing to see what you have in store for her.

Ok me figure a few things.
RD. 10(base) + 5(level) + 1(class) + 2(dex) + 4(armor mod) +1 (martial arts) = 23
I'm thinking you forgot the MA.
So the base armor armor is free as it doesn't come out of the starting credits That means that I have 12k to spend on gear. Is the superior fort mod on the armor still allowed? It wAsnt mentioned.
The language I'll take care of. No problem there.

Oh yes, you had Connections, then you should have 400 Cr left I think. My mistake.

Nah, it seems I had forgotten that you add the higher number of 1/2 Armor + Level and Armor. I thought it was the lower, but I see I was wrong there.
I don´t know where you are getting 12k from, but it is rather unlikely, since you only start with 3k. I know we talked about an alternate rule for starting credits (however, that rule would have given you 11k to start with, so I don´t know where you get 12k), and I said I´d think about it, but if you look at the first post in this thread, you can see I have not changed it. And I realize now that I forgot to add the license cost for the carbine in my previous calculations, so you should have 1630 Cr left.

Original post updated... Cliff had originally given Jakira the Rescue destiny, but I'm up to whatever destiny you wish to give her.
I also saved the Legacy destiny given to Wes if you wish to adopt it.
Del-Fin Legacy.
Your are a descendant of the Del-Fin clan, Mandalorians hired by the Galactic Alliance against the Yuuzhan Vong as the most elite of shocktroops. The Del-Fin's were known for their ability to break any enemy line, or resist any charge, and were a testament to the ferocity of the Mandalorian spirit.
Prerequisite: Human or near-Human.
Legacy Destiny: If you have the Legacy destiny, you can spend a Destiny Point as a free action. For the rest of the encounter, you score a critical hit on a natural roll of 19 or 20.

Oh its only 3k credits for starting. I guess I must have misread that. No worries. The alt credit calculation is max credits * (level-1) *2 which would be 3k *2 *2 = 12k. That's where I got the 12k from if it would have been from when I started the character at level 3 for the equipment. But that is neither here nor there.
I didn't see an answer to my question about the Superior Fort Modification that I asked you about a couple of post ago. You said that Wes could have the Beskar'gam without extra cost, as it´s part of the concept but is that the basic armor without mods? Sorry for the questions I'm just trying to figure out what I can carry over.

## Re: [Leg] Tales from a Dark Age

### **Alicia** (2011-02-23 12:16:48)

I found the post about credits for starting beyond level 1. I had been mistaken it was Rodney, but it was GM Sarli who suggested the rule.
> Q: What are the starting credits for a character above 1st level?
> A: As a very loose guideline, your wealth at any given level should be something like this: (level x [level -1]) x 2,000 credits*
> * Double this for a noble with the Wealth talent.
> This basically assumes that roughly 60% of your total income is spent on upkeep, paying rent, buying food, paying taxes, repairing equipment, getting medical care, etc. (This is a much higher rate than in D&amp;D, where you&#39;d only be expected to &quot;burn&quot; about 10% &ndash; but D&amp;D doesn&#39;t have an Imperial Revenue Service.)
> For example, at 16th level, it should be somewhere around half a million credits.
> The reason I say this is a very loose guideline, though, is that at least half of this wealth would tend to be in a non-liquid form (e.g. property, intangibles such as favors and allies, etc.). As a very rough guideline, having someone owe you a favor (i.e. one-time intervention on your behalf, not to exceed one encounter) is worth about 2,000 x CL; having a long-term ally (i.e. someone who will help you out any time they are available) is worth about 40,000 x CL x (% chance that they&#39;re available).

Suffice to say, Cliff and I adjusted the above as we gave essentially an equal amount specifically for contacts and property. (max starting credits + (level-1)*2000)

## Re: [Leg] Tales from a Dark Age

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-23 12:28:31)

OK, sorry if that wasn´t clear. That would be for the straight unmodified armor.
I have a suggestion for you though that is within your price range and can at least emulate something close to several of the qualities of your original armor: The Environmental Bastion armor template. It gives at least a few hours of sealed environment, plus it does not lower you Fortitude Defense, making the armor function normally against environmental hazards. If you manage to scrounge up money for a Fortitude Defense increasing mod, you have a decent emulation of both Vacuum Seals and Env. Systems. Also (as I´ve been meaning to remind you) your armor innately gives you a +5 bonus again extreme cold (and a penalty against extreme heat), which makes your Env System(Cold) pretty redundant anyway. Last but not least, the Env Bastion template fluff hints that you can probably describe it as containing some environmental systems, though they have no mechanical effect.
Just a suggestion I came across while thinking about it a little. Also, if you would rather want that, you can add the Mandalorian template to the armor free of charge.
EDIT for post while typing: Thanks for that Alicia, but I think I´ll stick to what I´ve decided. If I forgot to mention it though, since you are two in the campaign, you can borrow freely between you if you´d like.

Ok DA, Alicia said that I could use 5.5k of Jakira's credits for the armor which would purchase...
Mandalorian template (free)
2k credits for Superior fort modification
2k credits for vacuum seals
600 credits for environmental systems (heat)
900 for Armorplast.
This leaves the armor one upgrade slot free for the future.
Does this work for you?

Apologies if I'm out of turn, but are you still accepting new players? I'll do some reading on the Era via Wookiepedia and whip up a character in the next couple days if that's alright.
> (level x [level -1]) x 2,000 credits

This is still accurate? I can't imagine buying that much stuff with only the corebook at my disposal, especially if encumbrance is being counted, but I guess a few extra credits leftover could be handy later on. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
At 5th level then, this would be 40k total available to my character - am I then only using 40% (16k) for gear, or just taking the maximum available for my character (max credits x 5) or what?

Well, the amount of players are limited by the amount of separate campaigns I can run simultaneously. I think 3 might be my limit, so I guess I can take on one more, but probably no more after that.
The calculations above are **not** actual, and were just an example that Alicia showed me. You´ll find all the info you need in the first post of this thread, and for the very few houserules I have, you can find them in the game forum.

Works for me. In fact, you actually have 2 slot remaining. I´m doing some houseruling to fix the fuzzy wording regarding the upgrade slots available for powered armor (and Beskar'gam), saying such armors have 1 more slot than "normal" armor of their size. Giving you 3 slots in total for Medium Beskar'gam.

**Servo's Story**
Born among the scrap of Raxus Prime, Servo roams the junk planet as a guide to the few interested travelers willing to hire him. He has circumvented the planet several times on foot - made slightly easier by some custom upgrades to his leg servos. Living the solitary life fits him well, and there are very few people that register as "friend" in his neural databanks. One is **Rex** - the droid responsible for assembling Servo from scrapped parts, and another is **Cog** - a freelancing astromech mechanic that hangs out at *The Rusty Bucket*, one of the few spaceport cantinas of Raxus Prime.
Only a couple weeks ago Servo was able to obtain complete schematics for a *SoroSuub X-34 Landspeeder*, an slightly outdated mode of somewhat reliable transportation that would make scavenging much easier. Most of the necessary parts are easy to find for someone who knows where to look, and he certainly does. But the smaller, more intricate pieces that take time. And Servo has plenty of that - what else is there for a droid to do, after all? He makes sure to check in with Cog once or twice a month to see if there are any special parts available, or job leads. There usually aren't.
**Servo's Concept**
Pretty much I just wanted to make a droid and I found this picture, so I went with what it looked most like. I'm well-aware Servo isn't carrying much weaponry, but it doesn't really fit with his attitude. Look at him - does he look like a combat droid to you? Not that there aren't perils on Raxus Prime (rogue droids and all manner of toxic or corrosive chemical pools for sure), but he can easily flee or avoid most of those. I'm also very new to Saga and RP in general, so I thought a simple droid who hasn't ever left home just fit. For his **Destiny**, I was thinking *Discovery* of some sort. It would be epic to have him find a discarded/lost saber hilt from some ultra-powerful Jedi or Sith - Luke Skywalker's from Cloud City garbage or Vader's from Deathstar wreckage - and I think that's where I'd like to take him. It could then serve as a reason to go off-world, whether in pursuit or escape; and attract all manner of lovely baddies (droid and carbon-based). I don't know the Legacy era enough to give him a more specific destiny, but I think anything determined by the GM that approaches that concept would be awesome.
**Servo's Current Activity**
At the moment, Servo is searching the insides of a rather large and damaged cruiser of unrecognizable design for anything that might help with his Landspeeder project, or anything that he might be able to barter to Cog back at The Rusty Bucket. He's about three days due North of the nearest Spaceport.
~~BW
**Note:** The ability increases went to Dexterity and Wisdom, so it doesn't change the modifiers and saves me re-crunching. <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->
**Edit:** Took the time before we start to GIMP Servo up a bit, making him look a little more like a Raxus Prime resident and equipping him with his rifle and bandolier.

## Re: [Leg] Tales from a Dark Age

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-24 06:14:41)

Well actually I can´t find many errors, though there are a few other things I´d like to point to. The only actual error I could find was that you should only have am Attack Bonus of +3, not +5. Also, you can´t store Electrobioculars in a Bandolier, as they weigh more than 0.5 kgs.
However, you seem to be missing everything that makes a droid special. You´re missing special droid systems and degree for example, which for example makes your character far inferior to all other characters. It´s like being a character completely without species characteristics. I would suggest that you take another look at Chapter XI, and I think you´ll see what I mean. If you have any questions (the droid rules can be a bit confusing at times), just ask me or anyone else. For example, without a Vocabulator, it can become really hard to speak to 99,99% of the inhabitants of the Galaxy.
Second, there are a few things about your concept that I´d like to discuss:

* I understand that your character isn´t a battle droid, but a weapon is very recommended to have, especially in the dark age that makes up the Legacy era, and even more on the lawless world of Raxus Prime. Remember Episode IV, with R2 and the Jawas? Something similar is far more likely to happen on Raxus Prime than on Tatooine, and there´s definitely no guarantee that you´ll be able to avoid all dangers. Especially not when those dangers are armed with blasters.
* Just as a tip form someone who has been playing this game a while, ditch the Dodge feat. The feat is quite weak, and most things that makes it good involves melee combat, or flying. In your case, I would strongly suggest taking something like Improved Defenses instead.

### **BWS2K** (2011-02-24 10:32:26)

Maybe his destiny would be to invent Galactic Basic Sign Language?
I put **Droid Traits**, but I forgot to write the systems I guess, that's what I get for posting the character past midnight. I did have them worked out somewhere though. The attack bonus for a level 5 Scout is indeed +3, and Electrobinoculars don't fit. I had read elsewhere that a common house rule for **Dodge** was to apply it to *all* enemies, but I considered *Improved Defenses* as well. I can't believe I didn't post the systems, but I did have a question about them - are we pretty stuck on the 1000 Credits limit? Is 1050 okay for starting systems? I think I had just over the allotted 1000.
Okay, I'll edit that stuff in, and adjust stats accordingly later today. I have this bad habit of going for *looks cool to me* over *this is a good idea*. A prime example is **Heroscape**, which I played a lot not too long ago. I routinely picked awesome army combinations, only to realize I had neglected *any* ranged combatants. They really fit a common theme, it's just that the theme usually ended up being "Here, have a turkey shoot on my guys." <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-24 10:43:12)

It´s true it is a common houserule to allow Dodge against all opponents, but it´s not one I´m using. I think Dodge does have some merit for certain builds, but since it seems like you were just using it to gain a defense bonus, Improved Defenses is a far better choice. Not to mention it fits well with someone who has spent his life on Raxus Prime.
You are limited to 1000 Cr that you get for free to use on droid systems, but there´s nothing preventing you from using your own credits to buy additional systems.
There´s nothing wrong with going with what looks cool over what is really a good idea, but somewhere there´s a line between what´s just not a good idea and what´s outright stupid <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> Traveling the Galaxy in the darkness of the Legacy era without a weapon falls under the former, but doing so as a droid on the planet of Raxus Prime would fall under the latter. I´m not saying you must have a weapon, but rather pointing out the present dangers that exists.
**EDIT Answer:** Long Stride don´t affect that you have a basic locomotion system made for a speed of 6 squares, it just allows you to use it to move faster. Just as the name implies, you take longer steps.

## Re: [Leg] Tales from a Dark Age

Okay, all set. I think.
I adjusted for the ability increases, swapped *Dodge* for *Improved Defenses* and adjusted accordingly, gave him a weapon and some internal storage, listed the systems with prices in parenthesis in case I math'd wrong, and changed some of the gear and credits carried.

Actually, I still see some inconsistencies in Wes´s sheet. With the 5,5k borrowed from Jakira, and the 3k you get for starting credits, you have 8,5k to buy gear for. However, I calculate your total cost for equipment to be much more:

* Superior Fortifying Armor - 2000 Cr
* Vacuum Seals - 2000 Cr
* Armorplast - 900 Cr
* Env System(Heat) - 600 Cr
* Helmet Package/Internal Comlink - 4000 Cr
* Blaster Carbine w License - 990 Cr
* Utility Belt - 500 Cr
* Extra Power Packs - 75 Cr
* Mesh Tape - 5 Cr

This makes for a total cost of 11070 Cr, and with the spare 1630 you would have had a starting credit count of 12700? <!-- s?) -->![?)](https://i.ibb.co/ynksRzZt/icon-question.gif)<!-- s?) -->

Alright then we can drop helmet package and take the remaining from the left over credits.
Sorry but from what you said in an earlier post pn the 1st page of this topic Ihad enough for all the unmodified equipment.

And the above credit total was lowered due to the weapon license.
That's why I still had the helmet package listed because I thought you were considering it as part of the armor as a whole.

One would think the Helmet Package was part of the deal, but sadly it isn´t. Just fix the equipment, double-check the math, and then you should be good to post him.
I´ll be participating in DW´s game now, a session takes about 3 hrs, but after that, I´ll probably boot up your and Alicias campaign. The other twp campaigns should come online sometime tomorrow.

Guess 9.5k will cover all the upgrades to Wes's armor, then he'll have the 3k credits to buy other equipment with a decent amount left over. Otherwise seems Dave will just have to wait to get the helmet package.

**Background/Appearance**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Gark was barely in his teens when Shaak Ti sought refuge on Felucia with her student, Maris Brood. He was selected by the clan shamans to hone his natural Force abilities and showed mastery over its telekinetic aspects early on. When Shaak Ti was destroyed by Vader's apprentice, Gark was one of the Felucians Maris manipulated to capture Bail Organa. Exposure to her passionate and impatient actions awoke something in him, and he soon discovered the power of the Dark Side. He fled the planet, knowing that the penalty for Felucians who follow the Dark Side is instant death. Aside from his robes and skullblade, he left behind all traces of his heritage knowing that he very well might never see his home again.
It's been over a hundred years since then, and Gark has traveled the stars and seen much of the galaxy. He's studied its plentiful lifeforms and learned to create rudimentary illusions of the Force as well as speak directly into the minds of the willing - and sometimes the unwilling. He spent his first days on the planet Kashyyyk, exploring the great forests there and studying the native Wookie culture. The Living Force is very strong in him, but his once brightly-colored skintones have now turned to shades of gray, his stature much smaller than it once was. He still wears his tattered robes and carries the weapon from so long ago, now worn with age and use. Something he picked up early on in his travels is his utility belt, which he wears beneath his robes and which contains many useful items. Wandering about from system to system gleaning what he can about newly discovered life, Gark is still learning to keep his emotions under control. There's still a remenant that remembers what it was like to follow a more malevolent path - Maris Brood's influence remains with him even after all this time.

**Current Status**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Gark is aboard the *Ender's Folly*, en route with several other passengers to the planet Tatooine. He wants to study the sarlacc located in the Pit of Carkoon and see how it compares to the sarlacc on Felucia.

A Felucian, eh? Only thing I found interesting about those guys were to pick them up and slam them into the ground while playing FU...this should be fun <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->
I´ll go through it later, but I´ll try to answer your questions first.
I´d say you can use Telepathy that way, though you would need to know their language unless you try to communicate a general emotion or something similar. A few pointers though:

* Remember that Telepathy is quite limited in what you can communicate with it. Given the nature of the talent, I might allow you a little more lenience with this, but don´t expect to hold elaborate conversations.
* While I´m perfectly willing to treat most people as "willing recipients" for Telepathy, you should consider the fact that a good amount of the Galaxys inhabitants would probably see this as offensive or intrusive, rendering them "unwilling" against further attempts and might even warrant an attitude decrease.

I could probably build you something similar to the MTD droid that Lowbacca has in the Young Jedi Knights series if that´s what you´re looking for. As for who controls it, it depends a bit on what you want it used for. If it´s just for translation I´ll probably make it an NPC, but it could also be ran by the protocaol rules from SGtD.

OK, let me see now...I'm afb at the moment, but I'll do my best to dissect your character.

* Initiative should be -1
* Quarterstaff damage should be 1d6-3
* Change Telekinetic Savant to saying "any telekinetic power", as IIRC both Force Shield and Force Blast are telekinetic as well, so they should also be included
* You seem to be one feat short
* Your carrying capacity is only 4 kgs
* IDK where you are getting all that money, you have 1200 Cr to start with

---

## Re: [Leg] Tales from a Dark Age (Accepting Concepts)

### **BWS2K** (2011-08-12 13:26:36)

I don't have it all in front of my right now either, but a couple things I can try to set straight:
-You're right about Initiative.
-Quarterstaff damage is normally 1d6, so if Melee Damage is (Weapon Damage + 1/2 Level + StrMod) that makes it 1d6-1, right?
-Force Shield is telekinetic, but Force Blast (oddly) is not. If you want to House Rule it that's fine with me, because it totally should be.
-One Feat short...? Beginning Feat + 2nd Level + 4th Level = 3, and he's Primitive so he loses Weapon Proficiency (lightsabers)... actually I think I see where I went wrong. I also forgot the two ability increases.
-My carrying capacity is, indeed, 4kg. Ugh.
-You're right about the money.
I'll adjust all these accordingly when I have the time. May not happen until Saturday or Sunday when I get some time off. Off the top of my head, any extra feat is probably going to either be Force Boon or Force Training. I don't think I need to drop any equipment, just adjust what I have left. The two abilities will likely be Intelligence and Strength, to gain an extra skill/language and carry just a wee bit more.

## Re: [Leg] Tales from a Dark Age (Accepting Concepts)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-08-13 07:40:29)

Yeah you´re right about the damage, and the feat your forgot are your 3rd level character feat.
Also, if you want some advice, I´d start him off in Scout instead of Jedi. You lose 6 HP and +1 BaB, but gains 3 skills, and thus the ability to be even remotely useful in situations where the Force isn´t applicable.
Take your time with the changes, I won´t be getting a new monitor until likely next Saturday. Plus I seem to have attracted some kind of minor disease, making me even more lazy and dazed out than normal...

### **BWS2K** (2011-08-13 10:06:36)

Interesting idea... I suppose he gets the Force Sensitivity automatically as a Felucian, and it's not like the BAB makes much of a difference with this guy... It sort of fits better, too, with the idea of traveling around... I like it. I'll re-configure when I can, but I'm on vacation for about a week so he won't be done until then.
Sometimes I get that disease too, like on the fourth day in a row of twelve-hour shifts at work. <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: -->

Growing up on the jungle world of Cerea near the capital city of Tecave, Vree-Toth was in constant struggle. Once, long ago, his family was one of the most powerful families on all Cerea. Some off-shoot relatives of his even sat on the Council of Elders. The most famous, Ki-Adi-Mundi, was the great Jedi Master. Then the revolution came when so many young rebelled. With rebellion came the CIS, then Order 66, and the devastating loss of Ki-Adi. The family inevitably reverted to its Cerean roots, shunning technology and the outside world.
For years, the family lived and thrived, visiting the nearby Citadel and interacted with its alien inhabitants, while still being a part of and Tecave and its noble stature. As the years progressed word came of an Emperor, and the loss of the Jedi. With saddened heart, the Mundi family continued on as before. As more years passed the Emperor was gone, and a new government was establish. Again, this did nothing to effect the walls of solitude that the Mundi family, and Cereans in general, has fostered.
Like the journey of a glacier down a mountain, so the generations of the Mundi Family came and went until a new Emperor arose, and the inevitable rise of the SIth. Jedi, outcast from their homes, and hunted through the galaxy, began to return once again to the closed world of Cerea. These random Jedi that came to Cerea to escape both Imperial and Sith alike have found a temporary and very fragile safe house with the Mundi family. On one of these visits, it was discovered that Vree was a force sensitive. Over the next few years, visiting Jedi would instruct Vree until he was formally adopted as a Padawan.
Quick to learn, he excelled at his studies of the Force. With no one to continually train with, and the need for secrecy, he sadly has never grown proficient with his lightsaber. Vree is constantly in a state of conflict – does he give in to his Cerean sensibilities and turn his back on the Jedi, or does he truly unlearn what he has learned and fully embrace his Jedi abilities and fulfill his destiny?

</details>

**DESCRIPTION**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Standing at 2 m Vree is typical Cerean. Tall, with his elongated cranium and awkward gait, he is a serious male. Vree excels at all types of learning, but has difficulty putting his studies to practical use. He is a slow- methodical thinker that is in need of more real world experiences. These real world tests will be the catalyst to determine whether Vree fulfills his destiny and becomes a Jedi, or simply reverts to his nature and status as a noble on the introverted world of Cerea.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-11-18 12:51:05)

Well, character looks fine, but there are a few mechanical issues you will need to fix before posting him in the game forum.

* You should only have a Reflex Defense of 16 when flat-footed. This is my ruling, but if someone knows anywhere that I can find some official ruling on this (Predictive Defense), I´d love to see it.
* You should have 63 Hp, not 51. 18 (Noble 1st level) + 40 (Jedi*4) + 5 (Con +1*5) = 63.
* There seems to be something odd with your feat selection. You´d have to take Force Sensitivity at 1st level in order to be able to have Force Training, but if you take those two you can´t have Predictive Defense since it´s not a Jedi bonus feat.
* If you could please list only the skills you are trained in, help me to avoid confusion.
* It would be nice if you could structure your equipment in a more easy to read way. Use [] to indicate a container, like a Utility Belt, and place everything kept in the container inside the brackets, including things that came with the belt when you bought it. Use () to indicate any special features of the equipment. For example: Utility Belt[Medpac, SR Comlink(encrypted)]. This way it will be easier for me to see where you keep things, and also to see what you bought from scratch. Also, you don´t need to pay for a credit chip, just consider any leftover credits to automatically be stacked in one, unless you prefer to have them somewhere else.

---

### **chiech22** (2011-11-19 07:35:33)

Sometimes when you just build to 5th instead of step by step you miss a thing or two. So If I take Predictive Defense at 1st, then I am not trained in Use the Force until 4th when I have an ability increase and I can train in a new skill. So I have to take Force Sensitivity at 1st so I can be trained in Use the Force to get Force Training at 3rd. Sadly this makes my character easy to hit until 6th when I can take Predictive Defense (hope I live that long)
I also forgot that I only get one Feat when I multi-class (hangover from D&D)
I used SagaForge 1.4 to make my character so I am sorry that there are some glitches.
I corrected the HP.
Noble gets 6+int skills, so I have 9 trained skills to start, plus 1 at 4th when I have a stat increase, plus with the Educated talent I can use all the Knowledge skills even if I am untrained so I included that.
This is how my Feat selection worked:
[1] Noble 1 – Force Sensitive + Noble Starting Feats
[2] Jedi 1 Jedi Starting Feat Weapon proficiency (lightsaber)
[3] Jedi 2 – Jedi bonus feat Strong in the Force, Character Feat for Level 3 Force Training
[4] Jedi 3
[5] Jedi 4 - Jedi bonus feat Skill Focus (Use the Force)
So I deleted Predictive Defense. Is that correct?
Deleted payment for Datachip
Corrected Possessions
Thanks!

Take my advice, ditch the programs, and create your characters on your own, step-by-step. Once you´ve done it a couple of times, you´ll be as good as error-free (unless you´re tired when you do it), and it´ll be as easy and fast for you that it won´t be worth it to use a program anymore.
You don´t have the wrong number of skills, but I still ask that you list only the skills that you are trained in.
I don´t get your credit total to sum up, it seems you should have more credits left than you have listed. Could you please list your credit purchases? Also, you don´t need to separate the items listed in the utility belt, everything carried in the belt goes in the Utility Belt[] brackets. After all, if you´ve placed stuff in them, the pouches aren´t really empty anymore, are they? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

I will take that advice. I have had to go back to the Core and other books so many times, I agree about SagaForge.
So I removed the Knowledge (all) from the skill list.
Here are my purchases:
Ion pistol 250 cr
Comlink, encrypted short-range 250 cr
Ration pack 5 25 cr
Datacards, blank [10] 10 cr
Datapad 1,000 cr
Jedi robes 0 cr
Medpac 3 300 cr
Utility belt 500 cr
Grenade, ion 2 500 cr
Holster, hip 25 cr
Energy cell 3 30 cr
All-temperature cloak 100 cr
Total 2990
left 1810

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-11-20 22:32:50)

OK, that clears it up.
You don´t have to pay licensing costs for starting weapons (it will be assumed you got them licensed somewhere in the past), but you will have to take it into account in game.
The Utility Belt costs 500, not 70 Cr.
If you want to, it is perfectly fine to describe the Jedi Robes as an All-Temperature cloak (I usually do), which makes a lot of sense both thematically and for making your sheet cleaner. Just list it like "Jedi Robes(All-Temperature Cloak)".
Finally, you should get 4800 Cr to start with, not 3000.

---

### **chiech22** (2011-11-21 07:08:54)

I deleted the license and All-temperature cloak, fixed the utility belt, and stating credit amounts. Sorry this has been such a hassle for you and thank you for being so patient.
If everything is now ok, what if the next step?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-11-21 08:09:15)

Ah, you may have misunderstood. You still need to pay the 100 Cr for the All-Temp Cloak, but you can combo it together with your Jedi robes so you only need one entry on your sheet, and it will also save you the hassle of reaching for it whenever you need it.
It´s no problem at all, I´ve been kinda busy anyway, plus I get some time to think about your story. Plus, I can feel like I´m being overly zealous about some details every now and then, but I figure if we get it done right from scratch, we won´t have to worry about it later. But I like to keep an eye on details, especially since it does actually matter where you keep things in your pack. If you have any further questions on how to format your sheet, you can just take a look at any sheet of mine from a game I´m playing in.
Once things look ok (and from what I can tell they will once you pay for the All-Temp Cloak), you can go ahead and post your character in the appropriate thread in the game forum. Then, you can just wait out for me to start you up with your own thread, and then it´s pretty much a go.

### **chiech22** (2011-11-21 22:19:56)

Thank you so much. You are 100% correct, everything should be correct before we start. I posted in the meet out characters forum. No rush on getting started, this week is Thanksgiving in the States so I will most likely be online erratically for a few days.

Well, looks good. As usual I have some pointers, though not all of them necessary have to be an actual error.

* You might as well go ahead and put (understand only) on all languages except Shyriiwook. Wookies can´t speak Binary or Huttese anymore than they can Basic. You may wanna think about getting some sort of translator device.
* Please list only skills that you are trained in, even if you have some special effect for an untrained skill.
* You have equipment for way more than your starting credits. Soldiers starts with 3000 Cr.
* What´s a Lock Breaking Kit? Can´t remember seeing it in any books.
* Your carrying capacity is 110,25 kgs.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-01-13 06:18:49)

* True, but this is the part where you can ask me to grant you some concept-based equipment. Since part of your concept is being a Wookie, and people generally can´t understand Wookies, I could put together some sort of translator droid for you.
* (STR^2)/2 is yout total lifting capacity, yes. However, the only limit I´ve ever found that matters is the threshold for carrying a Heavy load, which is (STR/2)^2

Jaadyr originally hailed from Kashyyyk, although that was many years ago and his history has been lost to him. With a drink problem and a penchant for battle, he's usually found frequenting one cantina or another, whether than be in a slave camp or, in the few times he's been out of captivity, a hutt-run establishment . Anyway let's start with how he got to where he is today. Jaadyr [pron. Jar-DEER (hard J, not a Y)] was taken from Kashyyyk at a young age and spent the entirety of his childhood and majority of his adult years in slavery. It didn't pay well and the young wookie harboured a lot of resentment towards his captors and on a few notable occassions managed to exact his revenge upon them. Often tasked with manual labour - space craft/station building or something equally menial - the wookie didn't really get much of an education in any form, apart from "hit this vibrohammer against this piece of durasteel or get a blast from a shock rod." However all this work made him a the physical epitome of his race and, coupled with his Albino fur, made him stand out as a figure head amoungst his people. Being white furred often made him a target from both his captors and his fellow clansmen alike. However when his snow white fur was coated in the brilliant crimson hue of fresh blood, he was truly a fearsome sight to behold. A sight that came a lot more often than not. Many people are patient, there's at least some tolerance before they crask and lash out, normally a fair amount at that too, it's not quite the case with this wookie. One wrong word, or catch him in a bad mood and you'll find your skull crushed between his hands. "Actions speak louder than words" is a particularly apt phrase from Jaadyr. Rarely speaking, except on the battlefield where it's a primal roar, you only need look into his bright red eyes to detect his intent. Enough of the sidetrack, back to the story.
So, he had been "working" in the mines on an unknown planet for at least two standard decades and had seen countless masters and slaves come, go or be disposed of, but it wasn't until a particularly spritely Bothan made his acquaintance that things changed. In a near death experience, the Bothan had bought his way out of the situation for some fresh meat, something that Jaadyr hadn't tasted in years. His name was Kath and he had been a smuggler/dealer/spice trader/jack-of-all-trades, until he was found cheating at a highstakes game of Sabaac and he found himself on the wrong side of the law when he refused to pay up. Having lost his fleet, reputation and credits, he was thrown down the pits as his final punishment where he would spend the rest of his life working to pay back his debt. The wookie wasn't the brightest laser cutter in the mine but he knew when there was a good deal to be made. After working on this exchange basis for six months, the two went into partnership and hatched a plan for escape. using the brains of the bothan and the brawn of the wookie, they felt there was nothing they could do. Word spread of their plan amongst the other slavers and they were sold out to their captors, who one night paid them a visit. Thinking on his feet, the wookie disposed of the threats before they even noticed and this triggered their escape as mass hysteria broke out throughout the camp. Leading the charge with the Kath at his side, Jaardyr smashed through countless opponents, ripping them limb from limb in a bloodfuelled rage. Hundreds of slaves followed suit and made it to the hanger bays before the camp was put into lockdown and their oppressors brought out the big guns. His coat soaked in blood, Jaadyr headed for the nearest space craft as Kath trotted along side him, the rest of the rebellion stayed back with improvised weapons to fight off the tide of destruction heading their way, sacrificing themselves for the cause. They didn't know how they managed it, but Kath, Jaadyr and a handful of others made it aboard the cramped quarters of a starship and offworld before the defense batteries could get a bead on them. Many others tried to follow suit, but they ended up being little more than a pretty aerial explosion for any onlookers on the ground.
They made it out of the system and to the midrim before they were stopped by a destroyer. Kath seeing that it was better for them to submit than become space dust submitted the craft.

Well, it looks good as far as I can tell, but I´d appreciate it if you could remove all costs and page references from the sheet. The costs are helpful when checking stuff off, but after that they just makes things harder to read.
I´d also like it if you formatted your equipment after the guidelines I´ve given in the forum. It´s not a massive rush for it, but the faster you get it done, the better.
I´ll work something out and start you off in a few days.

No point though since it doesn't bump the thread and it will never get read.

There should be a command on the bottom of the page to bump topics. This can only be done 1 per hour.
But then you can always just post that your sheet has been updated like most of us do. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

It was harder than I thought to work out something for a Wookie captive, but now I´ve got something underway here.

Was it determined if all available slots were closed?

Not sure when it was debated, but as long as it says "open" I´ll take on new players <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Haven't truly followed the books to that point recently. Going to have to do some research on the approximate timeline before I can put together a decent concept. Looks interesting though!

Hopefully you have room for another. Did a little background research for the time period. I will add the rest of the character sheet when I get home but here is the character description and background for a taste of what I want to play. Still working out a few minor details including a character name.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Description
A middle aged human male standing at 1.55 meters with a stocky build of 87 kilograms. His slate grey right eye peers out from under his shoulder length dark brown hair, while his left cybernetic eye glows slightly in a deep red. A metallic plate, painted matte black, can be seen across his left brow around the eye socket along with faint scarring across his left cheek and jaw line. Normally in dark shaded clothing such as a pair of black pants and jacket he adorns his salvaged and upgraded battle armor when ever he expects trouble. Painted a matte black with dark grey accents at the joints his worn medium armor is equipped with a few additional surprises for his opponents.
Background
Coming from a family that made the majority of its wealth in the aftermath of the Yuhzong-Vong war and were apart of some of the final battles. Although not of a political nature the family maintained many contacts after their rise and creation of their shipping business. [CHARNAME] was groomed from an early age to take over the family business and was privately tutored for many years. His life changed one night after his 9th birthday when a group of mercenaries assaulted his family's home. The security forces were overwhelmed quickly, his survival was due only to sheer chance and luck. He and his uncle had been cornered in a section of his house with two of the homes security personnel. When the security went down protecting him and his uncle from two mercenaries he picked up the fallen rifle and got off an extremely lucky shot dropping both mercenaries allowing them to escape. His uncle was wounded during the fight but made sure to see him to safety before he passed.
This brought forth a turning point for [CHARNAME]. With his family dead he was the surviving heir and began working to manage his families holdings, keeping them invested accordingly and the business mostly running on autopilot for the next few years while he began investigating who sent the mercenaries and training to fight. When he turned 17 he setout to join a band of mercenaries under an assumed name and false identification. He spent the next few years with the mediocre mercenaries learning the trade of war before splitting off on his own. After a few successful yet small missions by himself he recruited a Trandoshan and a human scout. Several more missions went by over the next few years. During this time he had gain little to no knowledge of who hired and ordered the hit on his family.
When the Sith-Imperial War broke out his small team got hired on as a insurgent team to break the ranks from behind while the hiring forces assaulted the front. He worked closely with several Mandalorians and other races who choose the life of a mercenary over the few years the war lasted. Although he lost the scout he recruited he purchased a small recon probe droid and installed several upgrades along the way. During one battle he was struck by debris thrown back from a thermal grenade, the resulting injury destroyed his left eye and crushed his eye socket. Using some if the contacts he had made over the years along with a sizable sum of credits he was able to get a cybernetic replacement along with reconstruction of the socket. At the end of the war he parted ways with the Trandoshan and returned to managing his family's business and fortune while again focusing on the event from many years ago.
After years of making contacts and digging through corporate business politics he finally got a lead, although flaky at best, and it pointed towards the core worlds. With the Second Imperial Civil War starting off he started thinking of the state of the galaxy and his lust for battle, blood, guts, and gore. With the possibility of finding vengeance for his family's slaughter and the new political turmoil he was posed with a question. Which side should he choose? Should he fight for the Imperials and help squash the Republic or should he find a way to turn the tables for the remnant of forces once again rising up. The decision did not rest easy on his mind as he began to anticipate the coming battles and blood he would spill in either name.

was looking up some information about droid purchasing (protocol format) and got a little confused. Trying to figure out how much a tiny sized sphere shaped droid with repulsor locomotion set up as a sensor/probe droid would cost. Essentially filling the roll as a "scout" for the character, flies overhead and relays real-time tactical information back to his HUD in his helmet along with ability to perform some other commands such as a simple ranged attack with a hold-out blaster strength weapon and computer use skill set. Wanted to possibly have it upgraded with a heuristic processor so it could think on it's own and not rely completely on commands. Little lost on setting it up and pricing it correctly. Other than that I should have the rest of the character sheet completed soon, had some PC issues that made it difficult to work on it

Hello
I'm new and just wondering if there are slots still available for this.
If it helps I have all the sage books and should be able to get on regularly.
