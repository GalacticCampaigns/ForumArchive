# YOU PICK THE GAME!

### **Sketchpad** (2010-05-14 18:34:12)

Hiya Gang,
Okay, I'm finalizing a few things and would like to see if there's any interest in any of the following. Please vote using the poll and you may vote twice. The briefs below don't go into character creation or anything ... just a broad overview <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Please ask any questions in this thread <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Mutants &amp; Masterminds: Heroes, Inc.</span>**
Welcome to Heroes, Inc., one of the largest super-heroic support services in the nation. Our founder, the esteemed Clint Harkness, served as the hero Gearwerk in the late '70s and early '80s before retiring and founding the corporation named after his heroic persona, Gearwerks. As time progressed, it became apparent to Mr. Harkness that the world could benefit from a support service comprised of superhumans, allowing mundane protectors such as police officers and firemen the luxury of doing their job without worrying about superhuman threat. Are you Heroes, Inc. material? Are you able to protect the world and collect hazard pay? Please apply at the front desk and thank you for your interest in Heroes, Inc.
------------------
Heroes, Inc. uses M&M 2nd edition and is in the flavor of mainstream comics such as Justice League of America and Avengers. In other words, heroes wear costumes and battle supervillains <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">d20 Modern: Chronicles of the Last Battalion</span>**
The year is 2307 and the peace that humanity has known for the last century has ended. From the depths of space, giant, mechanical beings calling themselves "The Collective" have descended upon the colonies and have obliterated anything in their path. To meet this threat, mankind has teamed with the noble Grun to form the Colonial Defense League (aka C.D.L.) , arming it with large war-machines known as mechas. But humanity is fighting a losing battle. It needs able pilots, mechanics and mecha-jocks that will win this war for it. It needs you! Join the C.D.L. today and take your place alongside heroes such as Colonel Kev Jet of Centuari IV or Sergent Deena Sark of Ridian Prime. Don't hesitate, go to your local recruitment center today and tell them that you believe in humanity's future!
------------------
This is the same campaign as I've noted in an earlier post, only using d20 Modern and d20 Future as the ruleset needed. The theme is basically classic Battlestar Galactica meets Robotech ... with some other things thrown in for flavor.
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Hollow Earth Expeditions: Legend of the Gold Raptor</span>**
After The Great War, there was a lot of talk about fortune and ancient treasures. Sure, some people have been successful, but none of 'em have found the Gold Raptor. What's that? Never heard of it? According to legend, it's a huge, golden idol that leads to the greatest treasures the world's ever seen. Some say it's in South America, others have said it can be found in the jungles of Africa. Heck, I'd even heard one shmoe say it's in Antarctica ... all that's down there is Penguins, y'know? Me, I am to find it ... and I'm putting together the greatest adventurers that 1936 has to offer! You in? Or you going to settle for reading the paper?
------------------
Legend of the Gold Raptor uses Hollow Earth Expeditions as its core system. It's a pulp game in the flavor of Indiana Jones, Tales of the Gold Monkey and The Mummy movies. Players should be playing larger than life heroes <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Pathfinder: For Gold &amp; Glory!</span>**
Raise a mug and speak of the heroes that grace this inn! I look towards you to undertake the greatest of sagas ... one of danger, of excitement ... one of gold and glory! The infernal Chellaxian Dogs want us to cower from rewards that are ours to claim, but I say nay! Let us raise our mugs and show them that we are free people ... free to claim what is ours! What say you ... are we goblins? Or fierce dragons?!
------------------
For Gold & Glory uses the Pathfinder RPG as its core mechanic, and Golarion as its world. Players should be heroic adventurers willing to stop evil, while gaining gold & glory in the process. The campaign should be considered high fantasy, and uses Lord of the Rings and Legend of the Seeker as inspiration.
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Spycraft 2.0: Agents of D.A.N.G.E.R.</span>**
Welcome agent, you have been recruited by the Department for Anti-Nationalism and Global Espionage & Recon, D.A.N.G.E.R. This isn't a cake-walk and is nothing like your past assignments. Founded in 1963 by D. Gordon Parsons and Christopher Wilson, D.A.N.G.E.R. is committed to the safety of the United Nations and the associated nations under their umbrella. In the past, we were passive ... so much so that even world leaders didn't know of our existence. But now, due to an increase in world terrorism, our hand has been forced and we've come out of the shadow to protect the world from global threats. Tread carefully agent ... your world is about to change.
------------------
Agents of D.A.N.G.E.R. is an espionage game that combines elements of Sneakers, Human Target, Johnny Quest and 24, adding a small element of GI Joe and Chuck also to the mix. There are a variety of backgrounds available and exciting backgrounds are a must <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I´m always interested in trying out new systems, and I haven´t actually tried any of these systems, even though Pathfinder looks quite similar to D&D 3.5, which I have some experience with.
Being a high fantasy fan myself, I vote for the Pathfinder game, but I also add in another one that sounds interesting.

### **Anonymous** (2010-05-15 03:51:57)

Gotta vote for Mutants & Masterminds. I've heard of both D20 Modern and Pathfinder, but never played them, thus M&M is the only one I really know.
