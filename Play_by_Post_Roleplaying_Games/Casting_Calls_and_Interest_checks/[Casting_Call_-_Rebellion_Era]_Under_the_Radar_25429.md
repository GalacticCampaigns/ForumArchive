# [Casting Call - Rebellion Era] Under the Radar

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-04-27 10:19:01)

*Attention, free citizen of the Galaxy. After careful screening, your skills have been deemed qualified to perform an operation of grave importance. Due to the operations importance, no more details will be given in this transmission. Should you, however, be interested in a job that promises great material rewards as well as a profound impact on the Galaxy as you know it, additional information can be found at the* Lizard´s Breath*, a local establishment found on Nal Hutta. They serve a local blend known as a "mudcreeper". You should try it out.* 
This is the content of the transmission that had somehow found its way to your attention. It´s origin is unknown, and all traces of it were effectively erased after it had been watched. The cryptic format of the transmission and the vague details are of course concern for caution but at the same time the promise of "material rewards" are interesting to say the least. In a time when the Galaxy is changing from the more lenient structure of the Republic into the almost martial order imposed by the Empire, good job is hard to come by, especially if you dwell on the side of the Galaxy known as the Fringe.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to ***Under the Radar***, a game set somewhere in that time period after the fall of the Republic and the Jedi and the rise of Rebellion. It is a changing galaxy, and the Rebel Alliance has not yet been formalized, but various resistance groups such as Kota´s Militia is making life for the new Empire hard. The idea is to expose characters to the Fringe, and have them forge their own destiny in this new order in whatever way they find suitable. It will be possible to make powerful allies and even more powerful enemies, to operate with complete freedom, and perhaps even shape galactic events yet to come.
<strong>Technical Information</strong>
**Starting Character Level** 6th
**Resources Allowed** Any officially published books, but nothing homebrew unless I get to approve it first
**Hit Points** Take max for each level
**Attributes** 36 pt buy, 32 for droids
**Credits** Max starting for your class, see notes below
**Backgrounds/Destiny** Backgrounds
**Additional Notes** Some things I´d like to press extra on:

* I am hoping to encourage ingenuity and creativity, so I´m not giving you a whole lot to go with in terms of credits and gear. It´s up to you to get what you need, using whatever means available. Rules for licensing and gear acquisition will be used.
* I am hoping to be able to try and use the rules for Skill Challenges in this campaign, and possibly also the Starship Maneuvers system. The point of me telling you this is to inform you that if you want to use any related feats or abilities, you are free to do so.
* I´m not gonna demand a small essay on your character, but try to flesh out your background a bit. Anything you put in there will help your character be more alive, and hopefully I can draw some possible plot hooks from it as well.
* Never trust a Hutt.

Well, I think this suffices for some basic information. If you have any questions, let me know.

Hoping to give this thread a bump because all of DA's games I've been in have been worth it.
I'm working on a couple of concepts. Either a Pilot/Mechanic or perhaps a Medic with some covert training.
On vacation several hundred miles from home so that will slow down my build time. I just hope there's a couple more interested parties out there in the 'verse.

If there is no rush its rather busy for me at the moment I have a few character ideas, just need time to flesh them out.

---

### **Parmenter** (2014-05-05 20:53:22)

I'm in no rush, however, I would like to ensure we have a good team. So, I'm open to any ideas/feedback/criticism.

No rush, take your time. I´m not in any hurry to get started, and would rather see some well made and interesting characters than rushworks.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-05-08 04:30:52)

Just to give some feedback on what was mentioned in the Interest Check thread, since I figure my introduction was a little hazy (on purpose) on that part.
The way I imagine it, you guys will make up a small independent cell operating on the Fringe, basically doing whatever activities you want to. You wanna set up a smuggling ring, do so. Want to become a saboteur squad for hire? Go ahead. Basically freelancing mercenaries offering their services for various jobs in order to get by. Of course, you will also have the choice of becoming involved in the politics of the Galaxy by choice of your actions. More morally righteous characters might want to offer their services to the Rebellion for the good cause, while others might see the benefits of getting on the good side of the ruling body in the Galaxy. Similar relations might be established on smaller scale, with various Fringe factions. And in some cases, trouble with one faction might cause you to seek out another out of necessity.
This is largely (without too much detail) the idea I have for the campaign. My introductory mission will get you all started and hopefully lay the groundwork a very exciting adventure.
If you have any questions or suggestions, just ask them.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-05-16 17:21:50)

Hey guy´s, how´s it going?
I´ve been stuck at home for a few days now, so I´ve put a little more work into the beginning of this campaign. I thought I´d see if you had any preferences as to when we could get going. It doesn´t seem to be a whole lot more interest at the moment so we will probably start off with 3 people, and maybe someone else will join down the line.
I was thinking we could perhaps aim for getting started around next weekend. How does that sound?

I´m still planning to run this, but I need some people to play <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> Was basically just hanging around until people had more time to make stuff. But if the interest still stands, I´ll start to set things up.

### **Anodyzed** (2014-06-11 11:37:26)

After refreshing my reading, and a PM from DA, I'll throw my hat in the ring. I'll be working on a Scout of some kind, probably dual classes, just not settled on what yet.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-06-11 17:31:55)

I'm ready-ish...I have some character ideas but I'd like to make sure they mesh with the Era and your idea of the campaign and the general "bent" of the characters. I'm considering a Level 6 force sensitive Trandoshan soldier (all soldier, no multiclass presently). Armor talents, DR10 force talent, vibro ax and a bad attitude....bounty hunter, marauder, scumbag type.. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> He'll be dancing with the dark side a bit , maybe not totally dark but reveling in the power of it more than he should...
But before I spend too much time on background etc I wanted to be sure you were ok with a "more scum and less villain" but certainly something less than an anti-hero. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-06-12 05:52:55)

I usually don´t care very much what kind of characters my players want to play. Unless I run a more specific campaign, I try to have it be suitable for any kind of character. The thing to consider though is the circumstances of the era of play. I don´t forbid anyone to play Force users in a Rebellion Era campaign, but if they think it will be the same as playing one in the Old Republic they are in for a surprise.

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-06-13 17:46:16)

Also, I wanted to ask about a few things:
1. how do I compute starting credits for a Level 6 character? I couldn't find anything in the books I have.
2. Do you subscribe to the strength-based skills (jump/Swim/climb) being lumped together as Athletics?
3. How strict do you anticipate being regarding dark side scores that eventually reach a number equivalent to the character's wisdom attribute? Lost to the dark side (and thus GM-owned) or still playable as long as the character doesn't go too crazy with that junk (and start killing off younglings!)
4. If a character takes tech specialist can they start with modified gear (assuming such costs fall within the starting credits of a L6 dude)?
5. Force points...per RAW and lose excess upon level advancement? or daily allotment of force points?
Thanx. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-06-13 18:45:02)

1. It doesn´t say anything, that´s why I wrote it out in the first post in this topic <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
2. Hadn´t really thought about it, but yeah, that´s one houserule I do like.
3. I take a very liberal stance on Dark Side Score, and always thought that rules was crap anyway, so I don´t enforce it.
4. Sure, you can start with modified gear anyway, as long as you can afford it.
5. Per RAW

So,for a 6th level character (Scout or Scoundrel), we're starting with 3d4x12 credits?
I'm working on a Scout with a couple levels of Scoundrel, and about ready to publish except for gear and background fleshout.

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-06-13 20:40:48)

IIRC the one character that has been posted above seemed to have spent 4800 creds I think. I must have missed the part about starting creds but shouldn't credits for a L6 character be different than for a L1 character (and not just by a factor of 6)?
Maybe I'm approaching this too much from a 3.5ish approach though... <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Yes, I think you are looking at the wrong book...
Scoundrels, Scouts and Soldiers all start with 3d4x250 credits, which maxes out to 3000. Nobles start with 3d4x400 which becomes 4800, and Jedi start with 3d4x100, meaning 1200. There are no hard guidelines for starting credits above 1st level, leaving it up to the GM, and in this case I stated what goes in the first post.
This is quite different from 3.5, sure, but then the whole approach to gear pretty much is. In 3.5 it´s a must to have a bunch of +X magic items as well as continuously gain more and better ones all the time. In SWSAGA you can go at level 20 with the same blaster you had at level 1 and not really notice any massive difference.
IMO, the SAGA approach is far superior, as characters becomes more about what *they* can do, not what their *gear* can do.

### **Anodyzed** (2014-06-14 13:44:40)

So do you wan the characters posted before you decide who gets in? I have Deeg done, including some backstory.
Only have to buy gear. Not too rough doing that.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Kurrsk’s Bio**</span>
I am Kurrsk of the BlackScale Clan and am Chosen of Ak’Kra’Far. Ak’Kra’Far, the First One, the Great One, the Mighty, the Uniter of the T’doshok…in fact so Great is He that there are simply not enough words to adequately capture His Magnificence.
I was not always Chosen. Many years ago, foreigners came to our village on Trandosha. Sluurr, Chief of the BlackScale Clan sent a number of us to prove ourselves to Ak’Kra’Far. [*Editor: Kurrsk was actually sold to a band of Duros pirate-wannabe’s as a sort of indentured servant/mercenary in exchange for a variety of trade goods.]*
The foreigners, members of a race called “Duros” took us to some jungle world where we received additional combat training for a few months. We were taught to fight and shoot and wear armor. Of the ten of us who started the training, only 6 completed it. Clearly, Ak’Kra’Far found the others unworthy.
The six of us joined the Duros as, well, in Basic, the Duros term translates to “Independent Re-purposing Artists.” I believe the Duros found this clever but I believe it illustrates a principle that Ak’Kra’Far has taught us: “If you are too weak to defend your things, the Strong will take them from you. As they should, because you do not deserve them.”
We re-purposed many things from many weak people over the years. Eventually, my Duros associates noticed that when we would gather from time to time in entertainment establishments, the Great One would frequently call me to the Test among the rabble that would accumulate in such places. I came to learn that Ak’Kra’Far did not just want to test me against those of my Clan and among fellow T’doshok. No, I could hear the Great One whispering to me, exhorting me, once again calling me to the Test. To prove that the T’doshok are the greatest warriors in the entire galaxy! I have answered His call and I will triumph or die trying!
After seeing my victories in earlier Tests, the Duros decided to assist me in my Trials by flying me from planet to planet to permit me to be tested among other supposedly powerful warriors. I discovered a number of other T’doshok in “the Blood Pits” as they were often called. [*Editor: the Duros were managing a few other fighters in various Outer Rim gladiatorial competitions. “Trannies” are highly sought after in blood sports since, with their limb regeneration ability, they can provide good, bloody entertainment and, should a limb be severed or maimed, the Tranni gladiator will be able to grow it back given sufficient time.*]
The last Test I competed in I fought a big Wookiee who thought himself a better warrior than I. He was bigger and stronger than I was. He entered a state similar to the Warrior’s Rage Ak’Kra’Far has bestowed upon me. [*Editor: Dark rage force power.*] He used dual ryyk blades and came at me in a fury! I was armed with my usual vibro ax. Neither of us wore any armor. The crowds tend to prefer Tests where the competitors don’t wear armor. That Wookiee wasn’t expecting to face a Chosen of Ak’Kra’Far. That Wookiee wasn’t expecting me to be able to become Invulnerable. [*Editor: Damage Resistance 10 Force Talent.*] Finally, that Wookiee wasn’t expecting to have that arm chopped off either!
As I finished him off, I heard blaster fire and felt a minor pain in my shoulder. Blessed be the gift of Invulnerability Ak’Kra’Far has bestowed upon me.
I looked up and saw who had fired at me: one of a large pack of Ubese who were apparently managing the Wookiee I had just killed. Apparently, Wookiees don’t regenerate!
Chaos erupted as my Duros managers and fellow shipmates opened fire on the pack of Ubese, which in turn, prompted other spectators to join the now massive fire fight. Amidst the yelling, screaming, smoke and blaster bolts, the Ubese who fired on me was rather surprised when I jumped the 10 meters out of the Pit [*Editor: Surge force power.*] and promptly bisected that Ubese! I demonstrated to the remaining living Ubese that a Chosen of Ak’Kra’Far cannot be beaten! And certainly not by some smelly Wookiee!
When the smoke began to clear somewhat, I realized that my Duros managers and fellow shipmates were now all either dead or had fled. SecPat’s were on the way and I had to get out of there. I grabbed a dead Ubese and ran to a darkened corner. I took the armor off of him. Or, as the Duros would say, I was able to re-purpose the armor and the few possessions he was carrying.
Eventually, I was able to “persuade” an independent trader into dropping me off here. I have no creds but I do have a vibro ax and the Strength to take that which the Weak cannot keep.
I am Kurrsk of the BlackScale Clan. I am Chosen of Ak’Kra’Far. I have been called to the Test and I am coming…
[*Editor: Whether Kurrsk is actually receiving communication from Ak’Kra’Far, who may be a Dark Side Spirit, is left for the GM to decide. Perhaps Ak’Kra’Far only exists in Kurrsk’s mind…perhaps Kurrsk is simply a schizophrenic maniac who justifies his appetite for slaughter by calling himself Chosen of Ak’Kra’Far.*]
Have fun. I know I will… <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Deeg was a little put out with his last employer. He’d worked hard to set that up and he got cut out of it with so much as a Droid’s heartbeat. Well, that wasn’t the first. Probably wouldn’t be the last.
Deeg had grown through the ranks of a minor no name Hutt, becoming a minor gun, and occasionally a set up guy. It was his job to bring the marks in, and then leave them to the higher ups, who put them in debt to the Hutt. The trickle down theory said that some of the profit would come back down, if every one did their job. Well, what Deeg got didn’t really count for ‘trickle.’
Having left his poor family on Duros some 10 years ago, hitchhiking when able and stowing away otherwise, he’d grown up on the streets, and for a Duros, that wasn’t always pleasant. But once he’d found the employment to his liking, he wasn’t picked on any more. But now, well, he didn’t know if anyone cared he’d left. But he had to strike out on his own. Or maybe not “his own” but more like with a like minded crew. Not his crew, of couse, that would take time. But he needed to be a bit higher up the food chain than he was under the Hutt.
So, we’ll see how this next set works. Maybe setup, maybe stick man, maybe even shooter. He’d see.

So, are we all in? When should we begin?
I've never done a PbP thing. How does combat tend to work (outside of an external program)?
Also, there's an optional rule in the Jedi Academy nook that allows a character to reach out to the dark side when using a FP. So, a L6 guy gets to throw 1d6 (d8 if strong in the force) and add that to his/her roll. Under this proposed rule, reaching out to the dark side would enable that character, at the cost of a DSP, to add an additional 1d6 (d8 if strong in the force) to that roll.
That way...the dark side does have a seductive allure....

There are still some people who have shown interest that have yet to submit a character. They have stated that they have been a bit busy though, so I want to give them a little more time. Other than that, we´ll start when I´ve had a chance to go through and approve of the submitted characters. Take the time to look over some old games if you are unfamiliar with PbP, it´s not that complicated at all.
That rule assumes one uses the more conservative stance on Dark Side Score that the book uses, which I don´t. And if you don´t then that rule essentially becomes a way to punish people for their roleplaying choices, which is nothing I support.

ok, thanx, DA. Then I'll stand by...(although I am chomping on the bit some... ) <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
Do we want to set a submission deadline so folks might have a friendly nudge to get going? Like all characters to be submitted by Friday June 20 1800 Greenwich and start that following week (after those late-submitters' characters have been reviewed and approved)?
I don't want to rush people but, like I said, I'm eager to get going... <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I want to make sure that people have adequate time to get a submission together even if they are a bit occupied, but I think I´ll be aiming to start around next weekend. That should give time for people to get something together, and for me to look over the already submitted characters.

<details><summary>&quot;Background&quot;</summary>

Born out of an illicit love affair between a Clawdite and Zolander, Vallat grew up to be what his Zolander mother thought a normal Zolander, untouched by the curse plaguing the Clawdites.
He lived a comfortable life typical to Zolander nobles. He chose law enforcement as a career and through his family’s connections, gained entry and studied at the Balaidas Academy.
While serving his people in Zolan, Vallat was assigned to investigate Clawdite related crimes. At that time, his sensitivity to the Force manifested and with his fledgling Force abilities, became a well-known Clawdite hunter.
By his 24th birthday, as if a jest of fate, his Clawdite genes manifested. He uncontrollably changed in size, sometimes going smaller, at times growing larger. The sudden change also somehow took a toll in his muscular system, substantially weakening him.
He was outright disavowed by his family and was to thrown to the Clawdite ghettos, forced to live with the race he once persecuted.
When offered a job as an operative by the CIS, he immediately accepted to escape the planet he calls home.
In one of his missions, he was intercepted by Republic ships and his vessel, badly damaged. Rather than risk capture, he blindly engaged his hyperdrive, eventually re-entering real space in an uncharted sector of the Outer Rim.
His ship crash-landed in an unnamed planet which is the hiding place of a very secretive sect of Force users, the Fallanassi.
Vallat was rescued from the wreckage and was nursed back to health. Realizing his natural ability to change size and appearance, the Fallanassi trained him the ways of the White Current and tasked him as the agent to act as the tradition’s eyes and ears in the galaxy.
He drifted the galaxy, assuming various roles. Avoiding having direct contact with emerging Empire nor the various resistance groups, he worked in the Fringe. This gave him perfect opportunity to observe at a safe distance.
Vallat's investments in MerenData provides him a steady stream of credits to fund his missions.

</details>

<details><summary>&quot;Appearance&quot;</summary>

In his natural form, he appears a frail looking Zolander. He stands at 1.8 meters and weighs a measly 50 kg. His skin color is olive green and his eyes, black in color.
He normally presents himself as a comely human of medium build with black curly hair and expressive brown eyes.
![VallatKayyu-Human_zps099ed474.jpg](http://i743.photobucket.com/albums/xx80/JOPZ/VallatKayyu-Human_zps099ed474.jpg)
Vallat is one of the few Clawdites that can maintain a disguise even when asleep.

</details>

<details><summary>&quot;Personality&quot;</summary>

In his various guises, Vallat learned to exhibit an assortment of personality, sometimes to represent a general demeanor for a group of people or specific to a particular person.
However, he normal presents himself as a serious and dedicated individual that values his own opinion. Although given explicit instructions not to interfere in situations that may possibly lead to his discovery, he takes risks to rectify injustices if he is confident he can get away with it.
He understands the reason why he was selected by the Fallanassi for the job. As such, he takes his mission to the point of fanaticism. With the Jedi Purge executed by the current regime, he takes extra steps to hide his Force abilities. For the same reason, he avoids entanglement with the Empire unless warranted by a very important objective.
For the same reason, he adopts a guerilla tactic in combat, preferring to keep his distance and avoid melee if possible.

I had a rough week at work, so I didn´t post much, but I´ve gone through the applications.
**Parmenter** - Looks good, but don´t forget to complete the background.
**Fax** - You have one trained skill too many. Probably due to Stealth, your background doesn´t actually give you training in the skill. Also, you may want to look over something in your background so you aren´t surprised when you cannot replicate it in game. Jumping 20 meters high is pretty much impossible even with the Surge power, as the DC for the check is 240 (12 x the distance in meters).
**Anodyzed** - I can´t tell exactly how you´ve spent your attribute points, but the most expensive cost for that array I can come up with is 31. You also can´t have the WS(Pistols) talent as Scout/Scoundrel. And I´d suggest you remove all the redundant fields on the sheet, and there were also some numbers off (Some skills, number of languages, grapple mod).
**KUPALISS** - Your languages seems wrong, you should have Basic, Clawdite + 5 more. Your Fortitude defense should be 2 points less - Technically, the flight suit is not armor (which is why you can wear it and still get the +1 Fort without proficiency), and therefore you cannot use the Fortifying Armor upgrade on it. Your skills section also seems off - First, only list trained skills or skills you have some special untrained modifier on (and then list it!) and please also note somewhere what Background you have used, and second you seem to have chosen trained skills you can´t train in as Noble (Acrobatics, Stealth), but those might come from a Background.
I will set up the forum with some base threads tomorrow, and have the opening post up somewhere during the late day. Fix these things before you post your character sheets in the appropriate threads please, though you can feel free to post in the main game thread before you have fixed it.

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-06-29 18:47:59)

@DarthAnthrax: background fixed 20m to 10m. I only have 5 trained skills ( soldier 3 + 2 int). Stealth is on there because I get a +2 in it for background ( which is why at a +6 it's substantially lower than my trained skills.) <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

OK, then please not it as untrained or something, because that´s something that will be forgotten.
Btw, 10m is still pretty much a stretch for anyone but the most skilled Force-using athletes (DC 120 might be impossible for anyone, haven´t done the math). It wasn´t so much something I thought needed to be "fixed", I just wanted to alert you to it so that you don´t think I´m messing with you when you can´t do it in game.

Sorry about the mess. I thought I indicated the Law Enforcement Background in my stat block. I did mention it in the background tho'.
Will rectify all mistakes after work.
Thanks!

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-06-30 14:41:50)

No problem. And it´s always good to clearly separate mechanical elements from roleplaying aspects. A character who worked in Law Enforcement could have fallen into disgrace and joined organized Crime. Then it becomes more difficult to discern which background mechanic he used just from reading.

Hello all,
Are you still looking for players for this game? If so, I'd be interested in playing. I'm new to this forum, but not new to PBP or Star Wars RP. I usually do a lot of GM'ing for my local group, so I'm looking forward to being a player again. I'd like to play a fringe spacer who lives somewhat hand-to-mouth and likes tinkering with ships and engines (probably not wealthy enough to own his own ship, but maybe one day...)
thanks,
}I

Sure, we can always fit in an extra player. Send in a character and I´ll see what we can do.

Background: <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Maddox Zel is a native of Corellia. He always had an affinity for tinkering with machines, droids, and speeders. Zel had a good job lined up with Corellian Engineering Corp. as a designer when the Separatist War broke out across the Galaxy. A young Idealist, Zel left Corellia to fight for the "Confederacy of Independent Systems" and lost everything when the Separatists were defeated.
Since that time, Zel has been making ends meet as a starship/droid mechanic at various small spaceports around the fringe. When he gets tired of one backwater planet, Zel will sign on with an outbound freighter as engineer and move on until he finds the next backwater that takes his fancy. He has slowly built up a web of contacts (consisting of ex-soldiers, bureaucrats, warehouse managers, old separatist sympathizers, and other shady dealers), dating all the way back to his days as a soldier, through which he can sometimes acquire hard-to-find equipment and hard-to-obtain licenses and registrations (sometimes with questionable origins). He's been trying to save up enough money to buy his own ship, but it's hard to get rich on the fringe without making a deal with a Hutt crime lord (a life-complication he has so far avoided).
Maddox fought in several battles and skirmishes during the war, usually as a part of a mixed droid/living unit. He does not have a very high opinion of battle-droid capabilities and sees their limitations as part of the reason the Confederacy lost the war. He faced off against the Republic/Empire's clone troopers more than once, but never fought directly against a Jedi General (fortunately for Zel). Along the way, he put his talents to use maintaining and upgrading his unit's equipment and compliment of droids. He learned some battlefield medicine too, out of necessity. He never did surrender, but simply disappeared into the Fringe when his unit disbanded. These days Zel tries as hard as he can to avoid the notice of Imperial authority, but even he has to admit that life has gotten pretty boring. His old idealism has been strongly tempered by his combat experience, the collapse of his cause, and the rise of the hated Empire; however, he has heard rumors of groups organizing a rebellion and might consider joining one if he could find one.

</details>

NOTE: I do have an alternate character concept in mind if you think this one is too much like Deeg. Personally, I think Zel is different enough, but i don't want to go stepping on any toes my first time out!

You should have 6 FP, not 5.
I Also get it to a 34 pt buy, not 36, so some numbers are off I think too. I don´t know what background you chose, so you should probably note that.
