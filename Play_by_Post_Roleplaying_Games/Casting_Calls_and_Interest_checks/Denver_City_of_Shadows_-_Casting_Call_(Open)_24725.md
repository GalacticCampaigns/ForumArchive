# Denver: City of Shadows - Casting Call (Open)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Denver: City of Shadows**</span>
*“Welcome to Denver, the City of Shadows, though if you want to be less romantic about it you can call it the Front Range Free Zone. It’s like the old Wild West out here* omae*, so listen up. Between the four nations that “rule” this sprawl and the Zone Defense Force, not to mention the Yaks and other gangers, there’s enough heat to give any SINless slot one hell of a headache. Fortunately for a ‘runner like yourself they rarely like to play nice with each other and as you well know that means there’s plenty of opportunity to make a little nuyen. That’s not to say it’ll be easy, but then the Biz never is. Keep your head down and you might just keep it long enough to spend some of that cred I mentioned. Speaking of, I need to take this call. Get yourself settled in and I’ll check back with you when I can.”*
This is a 4th Edition Shadowrun game set in Denver, during the year 2070. Shadowrun is a gritty sci-fi/fantasy blend set in the dystopian near future. Magic and cyberware are commonplace as are elves, orks, and trolls. The player characters are Shadowrunners, elite illegal operatives who undertake a variety of missions, from corporate espionage and extractions (whether the target is willing or not) to good old fashioned wet work (though not all ‘runners are willing to perform assassinations). Shadowrun is a dark setting that contains many adult themes not suitable for minors.
At least in the beginning I’ll be using the free Shadowrun Missions campaign. If you’ve already run through this material but would be interested in playing in a Shadowrun game let me know and I’ll see what I can do. If you are unfamiliar with the Shadowrun setting or the 4th Edition rules you can still participate. The official website has a free primer on the rules at <!-- m -->[http://www.shadowrun4.com/quickstart/](http://www.shadowrun4.com/quickstart/ "http://www.shadowrun4.com/quickstart/")<!-- m --> (though unfortunately nothing on character generation). There’s also a decent amount of setting information online, check out [http://www.shadowrun4.com/resources/timeline.shtml](http://www.shadowrun4.com/resources/timeline.shtml "http://www.shadowrun4.com/resources/timeline.shtml") and [http://wiki.dumpshock.com/index.php/Main_Page](http://wiki.dumpshock.com/index.php/Main_Page "http://wiki.dumpshock.com/index.php/Main_Page"). Finally ask around about acquiring pdfs. It would be wise to have at least some understanding of the setting before posting a character but I will be happy to help answer any questions that I can. If you need help with character generation post your background and what kind of character you’d like to play. If you’re selected I’ll gladly help you build the character.
The player characters are relatively inexperienced Shadowrunners who have just relocated to Denver. The reason you have moved to Denver and where you come from is up to you. Possible reasons could be your last run went bad and you needed to get the heck outta dodge, you made a serious enemy in your last city, or you just got bored and wanted a change of pace. Whether your characters know each other beforehand, have met in the few days you’ve been in Denver, or are just meeting for the first time as the game starts is also up to you. However we’ll cross that bridge once all players have been selected.
<strong>Character Creation Guidelines</strong>

* 400 Build Points
* Books: Any SR4 book is allowed. I am using SR4A, the Anniversary Edition of the core book. Any older edition books can be used for source material, but that's it.
* Races: Any metahuman should be fine, but remember the rarer the metavariant the more discrimination you'll face. No sapient critters.
* Contacts: You’ve just moved to Denver. That doesn’t mean you can’t have high Loyalty contacts (after all you could easily have an old friend in the area), but you probably shouldn’t have a plethora of them. In the few days you’ve been in town before the game starts you have time to acquire as many new, probably low Loyalty, contacts as you can afford. Try to give me some details on your contacts and I’ll try to flesh them out some.
* Lifestyles: Include what sector of Denver you live in: UCAS, CAS, Pueblo, or Sioux. Obviously this doesn't apply if you're homeless.
* Detailed backgrounds and descriptions are required. I’m not looking for a novel but put some genuine thought into it.

**Posting Guidelines**

* I expect players to be able to post at least every other day. I say that instead of the more typical "3-4 times per week" becuase it doesn't really help matters much if you post twice in two days then wait a week before posting again. I’m not gonna be a Nazi about it but it’s just all too common for a pbp game to die from slow posting rates. If your character is holding up the action for an extended period of time expect to be autopiloted. If it becomes a serious problem I will retire your character and reopen casting. That’s not to say you couldn’t return at a later date, but you’d have to wait for a slot to open up.
* Obviously exceptions can and will be made for real life. I’m a pretty understanding guy, if something comes up just let me know and arrangements will be made.
* Try to avoid one- or two-line posts. I’m not going to jump your case over the occasional one-liner but try to make your posts descriptive and entertaining. After all that’s the point of this whole exercise.
* I’m not an English major but I do have access to a word processor. I don’t expect flawless grammar (I know my own isn’t flawless either) but it should be at least passable. If English isn’t your primary language I won’t hold it against you, but I still need to be able to understand your posts.
* The In Character thread is for IC stuff. The Out of Character thread is for OOC stuff. Any checks you need to make and the breakdown of combat actions should be placed in double parentheses, ex. ((Intuition + Perception = 6)), at the end of your IC post. Any other OOC comments should go in the OOC thread.

Casting is not on a first come, first serve basis but I'm itching to get this started so don't take too long. If you’re still reading after all that and have any questions feel free to ask. :P

**Life until New York**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jonathan Miguel Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez Marleon was born into the family of a corporate CEO. His younger years were rife with irresponsibility and a distinct lack of interest in his father’s corporation, school, and his parents’ expectations in general.
He began to show some magical aptitude during his delinquent teens while terrorizing his parents’ reputation and the local female community with his scandalous lack of discretion. His father sent him to be apprenticed to one of his corporation’s highest ranking mages, hoping this would give his son some discipline and a direction in life.
He was very, very wrong. Formal training in magic only served to aid Johnny’s dilettante behavior. After being thrown out of his Master’s home for bedding both his master’s daughter and wife Johnny returned home to further degrade his family name.
After he was publicly involved in a scandal involving an Ork prostitute, three disreputable dwarves, and the daughter of one of his father’s strongest corporate allies his father became enraged. He publicly humiliated Johnny by striking him on the steps of the family home in front of several news agencies. Johnny decided he was fed up with his father’s draconian expectations and rules, and tired of the imagined mistreatment by his family. He chose to make them regret their poor conduct towards him by running away. Johnny believed this would hurt them emotionally and give him the freedom he had always wanted.
Much like his father, Johnny was very, very wrong. Upon finding Johnny gone and reading the letter he had left, his father acted quickly by having an unmanned hover crashed and declaring Johnny dead, with the tearful family by his side at numerous press conferences. Little did the public know they were tears of relief and happiness, not sorrow.
Johnny found himself alone with very little resources in the shadows. He learned quickly that his skills with magic were valuable and that his refusal to learn while young had left him with an utter lack of technical know-how. While he made fortune after fortune on runs he spent a large percentage of it hiring the abilities of hackers. Between his expensive tastes and constant need of hackers he was perpetually destitute.
A year into his shadow-running career he made the acquaintance of a rather talented techie named Marcus. Marcus was known in the Matrix as the Scion of the Root, or {$C10N.}. He and Johnny came to a mutually beneficial agreement. Johnny would provide magical security and muscle while Marcus provided everything else.
These two, along with various fill in runners, gained a staggering amount of notoriety and respect in New York’s shadowy underworld.

</details>

**Johnny leaves Old New York**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Marcus the Dwarf a.k.a.: {$C10N.}
Coming home struggling with the after-burn of Novacoke and Troll whiskey wasn’t easy, but Marcus had gotten used to it. What made today different was that his rig and several other expensive electronic toys were ruined.
*Johnny. Only Johnny. Damnit,* he thinks as he looks down on the ruined kit. *If the little bastard wasn’t so talented he’d of died shortly after starting puberty.*
The proximity alarms he’d rigged on the front entrance begins wailing, announcing a visitor. *Oh, god. What now?* He finds the monitor and tries to get it up and running then gives up when the door opens of its own accord.
“Marcus? Marcus, dear, are you here? I just met the most darling pair of Ork twins, Tweety and Pinky. These girls have the most amazing…” Johnny drawls as he comes in. *He’s been out,* Marcus thinks. *The Hawaiian shirt and wide brimmed hat only come out when he’s going to that damned freak bar, the Frisky Troll.*
“Johnny what happened to my kit?” Marcus interrupts him, not interested after the last double-date incident had landed him in the hospital.
“Kit? Oh, your little machines. You weren’t here and I tried to call you, but they started acting weird and…”
“Johnny, how many times have I told you not to touch my equipment? Do you know how expensive this kit is?” Marcus asks, more than a little irritated.
“Marcus darling, you worry too much! Here, I’ll whistle up a Wadsworth and have it find you a new one…”
“NO! No, Johnny, no spirits, not this time please,” remembering the last time Johnny brought a spirit into the house. Their senses of humor are even stranger than Johnny’s.
“Well then find one and I’ll buy it for you.”
“Johnny it’s not about the money,” he replies sounding tired.
“I know! We’ll steal one! I heard one of the Corps just opened new offices over in the Kitchen. They can’t have been hit yet.”
“No, we don’t need to steal one…”
“Oh come on, it’ll be fun! Like old times. If it matters I’ll leave some yen in its place.”
“JOHNNY!!” Marcus yells, throwing the broken monitor down, hoping to stem the unending tide.
“Oh! Ummm. Yes, Marcus?” Johnny replies, wide eyed.
“Johnny, you’ve got to go…”
“Why no, I don’t have to leave to meet the twins for another half hour at least…”
“No, Johnny, you’ve got to move out. I love ya like a brother, you know that, but you’ve got to go.”
“But, but …. Go? Where would I go? Who would take care of my date-ah thingies you’re always raving about?”
“I’ll take care of the data Johnny. And you’re going to Denver.”
“But… Denver? Listen to the name! Den-ver. It even sounds boring.”
“Look, Johnny, Denver sits on the border of several areas. Think of all the women there that have never met you…” Marcus says, cajoling and urging.
“You know, Marcus dearie, Denver doesn’t sound so bad after all.”

</details>

**Johnny Arrives**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Somewhere just outside Denver.
“Who is this twit?” the Troll grumbles to his buddies.
“I don’t know, but he’s kinda cute if ya ask me,” replies the human woman with the mohawk and cyberarms.
“Anything with a pulse is cute to you Mary. Shut up and listen,” the man next to her says as he pipes the feed from his cyberear through to their coms.
Ork Bouncer:”... n’t care who the hell you are, you ain’t comin in. Now git.”
Man in Top Hat: “But my good sir, my yen is good and my company better. Would you like to see a trick? I am an entertainer by trade you know.”
Ork Bouncer: ”You’ll entertain me all right. I’m gonna bleed you slow. Come here…”
Man in Top Hat: “Oh, how droll… SKREEE”
FEED INTERUPTED, HARMONIC FEEDBACK OVERLOAD…
Mary looks back towards the door as her friend’s cyberear melts itself into his head. She sees the short man in the purple tux push his glasses back up on the bridge of his nose, the Ork bouncer a charred pile of bones and ash in front of him.
The Troll slaps the screaming man with the cyberear away from the table, “Quit yer whining ya baby. Mary, invite the twit over for a drink.”
“What did he do to the bouncer?” Mary asks.
“Missed that did ya? Ha! Lighting bolts. From his eyes, no less. He might be of some use. Now go git ‘im quick, before someone else does,” the Troll growls. “And don’t be beddin ‘im either, don’t wanna scare ‘im off the job.”
Mary sticks her tongue out at the Troll as she leaves the table. She looks over the short man as she makes her way to him. With out the hat he may be five foot two, a hundred pounds with his clothes soaking wet. He wears the purple tux like it was made for him, the pants cut in a Zoot Suite style, with two-tone purple and white shoes that match the pure white shirt. The black thigh length cape draws the eyes to his trim figure, and the classic top hat set the outfit off. The glasses are the wire-rimmed round-lenses type, with the lenses shaded to match the tux. In his white-gloved hands he holds a black cane, which he leans on slightly as he walks.
*Screw the Troll,* Mary thinks as she gives the little man her best mischievous grin, *I’ll bed him anyway, especially since Tom’s too busy screaming on the floor back there…*

</details>

**After the Job**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

*Well, that could have gone better,* Johnny thinks as he wakes, shaking the dirt and blood from his head, along with the disorientation of being knocked out. He found himself in a burned out building, with voices coming from the next room.
He stands, straightening his ruined clothing as best he can while remembering how he was reduced to unconsciousness. *Ah, yes. The thirty foot fireball I threw at that annoyingly well armored vehicle chasing us from the weapons depot.* He makes a list as he stumbles towards the door and the voices arguing in the other room. *New tuxedo, cane, rounds for both pistols, and where in BLAZES will I find another rubber chicken?*
“Damnit Ted, we’ve got to get him to a street doc, ASAP!”
*Ah, the Maiden Mary. I’m glad she made it. She’s such a vigorous young lass. Those arms may be cold, and they may chafe quite fiercely, but they are SO **strong**!* Johnny thinks upon hearing Mary’s voice.
“Naw, Mary, ya see, that’s where yer wrong. ‘We’ ain’t doin’ nuthin’ but goin’ our separate ways, and ‘I’ ain’t doin’ nuthin’ but puttin’ the twit out o’ his misery so’s I ain’t gotta split the take three ways. If ‘you’ don’t start watchin’ yer mouth, I’m more’n willin’ ta do the same fer ya.”
*Theodore. What an uncouth knave. Were this run’s payouts not so promising I’d have never agreed to work with him. Wait, did he just say he was going to put some poor fool out of his misery? We were the only three on this run… Gah! That bloody troll aims to kill me! ME! Why, I’ll show this troll what-for,* upon realizing the troll’s intentions, Johnny limps into the doorway, pausing to lean against it and put on a show of relaxation as he straightens his hat and tie.
“Johnny! You’re awake, thank God. When you blacked out and your nose was bleeding I thought you weren’t gonna make it,” says Mary as she sits slumped in the corner nursing her wounds and fondling her AK-97 rifle.
“Never fear, lover, it takes a good deal more to stop me than a trifle such as mana-burn… or a pretentious, traitorous troll,” Johnny declares, his eyes piercing Teddy the Troll. “Tell me, Teddy, how exactly you thought you would manage to ‘put me out of my misery’?” Johnny asks, his voice rising to an annoyingly high pitch.
“Well twit, it looks li…” Teddy’s reply is cut short by the bolt of lightning that strikes him in the chest.
“Idiotic oaf. When you intend to kill someone you should do it, and then talk of it later if you must,” Johnny states as he begins limping towards the Maiden Mary. “Love, have we delivered the goods yet?”
“No, we’re supposed to meet the Johnson a couple blocks from here, OH SHIT!” Mary yells scrambling for the hole in the wall closest to her.
Johnny turns to find Teddy standing up, gripping his axe in one hand and his Ingram White Knight in the other.
“Oh dear… ummm, Teddy, have you ever seen a magician pull a rabbit from his hat?” Johnny stammers, clutching his hat, at the sight of the still smoking eight-and-a-half-foot troll in front of him.
“Gonna kill ya, ya damned twit!” Teddy roars as he brings the Knight up to fire.
Johnny reaches into his hat, far deeper that he should be able to, and pulls, tilting the hat towards Teddy, “Here you are Teddy, a cute fuzzy Wabbit!” he yells. From the hat springs a ten-foot tall rabbit, with ears longer than a man’s arm, claws longer than its ears, and teeth longer than its claws. Teddy opens fire, his rounds absorbed in a mass of fluffy white and brown fur, the sound of the gunfire drowned out by the rabbit’s roaring. Johnny ducks and scuttles for the shadows, pulling the light from the room into his fist and draping the room in darkness.
“Did ya forget trolls can see inna dark, twit?” Teddy taunts.
“Did you forget rabbits have amazing hearing, imbecile?” Johnny replies as the rabbit roars and the entire building shakes as it lands somewhere near where Teddy’s voice had come from. “And my name is Jonathan Miguel Sanchez Vila-Lobos Ramirez Marleon! You insufferable ass! Now be a good troll and die already!” he says in response to the storm of troll screams and rabbit roars coming from that area.
Johnny joins Mary near the cargo hauler full of stolen weapons with the cacophony of troll and rabbit mayhem still echoing through the block.
“Dearest, can you operate this behemoth machine?” he asks.
“Sure sugah, I can drive it,” Mary replies.
“Then let me get the door for you and let us leave here. We have a Mr. Johnson to see about selling these weapons.”
“Why you wanna get the door?” Mary asks.
“Because, lovely, I am a gentleman and a magician…”
TWO BLOCKS DOWN
“Where’s Teddy?” asks the buyer.
“Oh, something about the job is eating him. We are here to deliver your goods. You’re paying in cash, correct?” Johnny replies, giving Mary a wink.
“Sure, whatever. Here,” the Johnson says as he hands over a briefcase full of platinum credsticks.
As the Johnson drives away in the cargo hauler Mary takes Johnny’s arm and says, “Well sugah, gonna take me shopping?”
“Of course my dear, but first we need a hotel room with good, strong beds and ample room service. I’ve still got a few tricks to show you,” Johnny replies with a wink and a grin.
“Promises, promises Mr. Magician mine,” Mary says leaning her head on his shoulder as they walk on down the street into the heart of Denver.
TIME AND CREDIT PASSES
One month later, Johnny wakes in the luxurious 20,000 yen a night room he and Mary had been sharing to find her gone.
“Ah well. It was fun while it lasted lover,” he says to the night skies of Denver from the balcony, as he reminisces about her six-foot form in his bed. “Hmmmm, I’m broke, single, and I still don’t know where the good whorehouses are in this town. Time to fix that,” he states with a fresh grin as he puts on his new tux and top hat, grabs his cape and cane, and leaves via the back stairway. He slips out without paying the 200,000 yen bill they had racked up after their credit had gone dry.

Maeda Yumi AKA Fade
Concept: The child of a couple too deeply involved with the Yakuza in Tokyo, Yumi was taken from her family at a very young age to become a top trained assassin. Performed her first kill at age 8, after which she steadily gained more augmentations based on her performance. But the life as an assassin did not last. When the son of the Oyabun couldn't take a verbal no for an answer, Yumi used more violent methods. The result was that Yumi barely escaped her family and Tokyo, forcing her to leave Tokyo and her former life behind. Now Yumi or Fade as she calls herself, has taken up the life of a Shadowrunner, her many augmentations and training making her suited for such a job.
Type: Japanese Human cyber/bio augmented infiltration and extermination specialist
The background and stats will be put up soon.

Thanks Frost, I'm sure that will be helpful.
Also, I've officially decided we will be using the SR4 Anniversary edition rules. Sorry for any confusion. That means you'll need to look [here](http://shadowrun4.com/resources/sr4a/sr4a_changes.pdf "http://shadowrun4.com/resources/sr4a/sr4a_changes.pdf") for the changes if you have the regular SR4 book (and [here](http://www.shadowrun4.com/resources/sr4/sr4_errata_v18.pdf "http://www.shadowrun4.com/resources/sr4/sr4_errata_v18.pdf") for the errata if you don't have the 6th printing of the the original book).

hey, forgot what a pain char gen was for this game. what are our advantages and disadvantages limits? and anything over random potentially game breaking things that can be abused. forgot how many of them were in this game. oh and can we use the runner's companion and arsenal books?

Haha, well I love a detailed character generation system so I guess it doesn’t bother me. It is…involved though, I’ll give you that. :P
You can spend as much as 35 BP on Positive Qualities and gain a maximum of 35 BP on Negative Qualities.
Until I acquire those books you’ll need to explain anything from them in detail before I can let you use them. I’m sure it’ll probably be fine, but I’m not about to write a blank check.

all right, next question: the GM who ran the only SR games i've played was kinda Draconian (^%#@&^$) anyway, the way he ran things one rank of gremlins would practically guarantee a revolver exploding in your hands. the way i read it this isn't exactly true so what would your take on it be? if you could translate the rules to english (preferably southern dialect) i'd much appreciate it. i'm thinking of making GJ a tech null, it makes the gen much easier due to removed temptations <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

*Media Junkie* (Mild) The character spends about two hours a day on the Matrix browsing through various public nodes and sites. She also suffers a –2 dice pool penalty to Willpower Tests to resist the urge to surf the Matrix and to Addiction Tests.
*Enemy 4* The character possesses an Enemy (or more than one). The BP cost of an Enemy
is equal to the sum of its (modified) Connection Rating and its Incidence Rating.
*Combat Monster* The character is unlikely to willingly turn his back on an ongoing fight after the first blow has been delivered—even if outnumbered and losing. Make a Composure (2) Test to break away.

Red Tag (Fixer) (L:2 C:2)
Red Tag is a fixer that Frost met on a few missions in Denver a few years back.
Doc Martin (L:2 C:2)
Street Doc Frost was introduced to by Red Tag. Specializes in cyberware repair
Richard Frost’s life was uneventful, nothing you’ve write in a book or m-blog anywhere. What matters most is what Richard Frost did with his life. At young age, when most adolescents are trying to decide what color to dye their hair or what new high nano-tattoo to get, Frost had other things on his mind, namely ‘How in the hell do I get out of here?’ With that, Frost joined the Marines. Why? The recruiter was tenacious and aggressive, that he and offered Frost a sizeable enlistment bonus. Before he knew it, he was on a bus and well on his way out of the place he was in.
Frost’s test score were as such that he qualified for the Meritorious Advancement Program; while he boot camp, he achieved the rank of Corporal, much to the pleasure of his beaming Drill Sergeants. After boot camp, he was sent to AIT, wherein he received another promotion to Sergeant upon completion of that school. His first duty station was in Chicago, near the border of ‘Bug City’. Frost was half expecting to be sent overseas somewhere; Chicago could be interesting. He always wanted to experience what he had only see on trid movies. The post was fairly banal; he was made squad leader and his days were filled with mostly checking on the marines under his command, making the barracks were squared away, all the grunts looked good and a crisp uniforms and brightly polished shoes. All Frost had managed to kill in his time was boredom.
Then one day it happened. A change; the unit was informed that would be getting a new commanding officer, Col. Trenton Tagg and this guy was a regular ball buster. And busted balls he did. He ordered all training exercises to be cancelled and put the camp on full alert. ‘What a douche’ Frost thought. His squads were next in line for a 3 day liberty pass to Milwaukee and that got revoked. One of Frost’s men approached him, a regular slacker named Jackson; Jackson had a proposal. If Frost could get the men off base for their liberty, he would make sure they had a good time. Frost went to work; he utilized his charm and influence on the new Commander’s adjunct and convinced to sign the papers for the liberty pass. She agreed one condition. To this day, no one knows what condition was, because it must have been pretty good. A week later, she was reassigned to a detachment in Fort Lewis, Washington. She had no ill against Frost.
After their little adventure in Milwaukee, the squad was punished and sentenced to 2 weeks of extra duty. Much to Frost’s surprise then men didn’t complain. Without evening realizing it, Frost had single handedly done what no other officer or NCO could do, he had won their loyalty. From that day forward, the squad was inseparable. The base was the mercy of Frost and Jackson. The random assortment of men, had became marines, and the marines in that squad were a forced to be reckoned whether it was in local ‘watering hole’ or outside on the tarmac. That squad on fire! Though not everyone saw that way; Col. Tagg couldn’t divided loyalties in his ranks. After all, he had a ‘business’ to run.
There was something about Tagg that Frost couldn’t quite put his finger on. Frost noticed a lot of inbound and outbound traffic from the base. Traffic that hadn’t been accounted for; Frost started watch the log entries, several sorties were not being accounted for and some weren’t making back. Thinking he was doing the right thing, Frost reported his findings to his company officer. The lieutenant, being all marine and no brains, reported the information to Col. Tagg. ‘I’m dead. Nice going, Jarhead’ Frost thought. How could the Lt. be so clueless? With Frost contacted the NCIS, who initially dismissed claims as delusions under stress. Frost knew it would only be a matter of time before his squad was next to go over the wall and not come back. Sure enough that time came.
A week later, at an ops briefing, Frost got word that one of these unreported sortie had gone over the wall and was downed. Tagg ordered Frost’s platoon to go in and recover the goods and personnel that were lost. Frost knew that this was his death sentence. He went back to barracks, told the troops to gather their equipment and must their courage; they were going over the wall. Frost called Jackson aside and told him, if things went south, he had arranged another rendezvous point for extraction. Jackson confused by this, asked why they would need a second pick up point. Frost responded with ‘All marines have a backup plan’; the crew boarded the helo’ and headed into the zone.
The operation was going according to plan; they made it to the downed helo, the secured the goods and personnel. As helo began to take off, it shuddered and shook violently. Before they knew it, the ground was rushing toward them at an alarming rate. The helo crashed killing three on impact, one of them being the first sergeant. Frost took command and ordered an immediate extraction. The reply back was a team would be in route within the hour. Frost that as unusual. An encoded message told Frost that Tagg would be on the sortie over the wall to oversee the rescue attempt personally. Frost knew this is when Tagg intended to make his move. Frost ordered the troops to take up defensive positions around the chopper and they would wait there for extraction. After the cover of night, the second rescue team touched down.
Tagg berated Frost his inability to complete his mission. Frost clenched his teeth and took Tagg’s verbal abuse. En route back to the wall, the platoon was attacked a second time; this was it, Tagg made his move to ensure Frost wouldn’t make it back. Tagg’s personal detachment quickly disappeared under the cover of fire. Frost ordered Jackson to take the troops and fall back to the secondary position along the way. Jackson knew Frost wasn’t coming; Jackson reluctantly left, following what he thought were the last orders of the only marine he respected. Frost lit off several IR smoke grenades and within minutes, the squad was gone in the smoke filled night. Frost had business with Tagg. Gathering the weapons and ammunition that were left, Frost led a one man war against the Human Brigade that lasted 2 days. Frost fought so hard and so ruthlessly, that the Brigade had thought Tagg had led them into a trap. Their forces pulled back into the zone.
After that, Frost disappeared into the corridor, hiring himself out as ‘muscle’ and eventually gathered enough resources to leave to Chicago. Frost tracked Tagg downed to his private residence in the Hamptons. Where, from an almost perfect vantage point, he took one well aimed shot, in which he thought was fatal. Later, Frost learned that Tagg had survived and before he could come up with plan to take him out at the hospital, he was moved to secure location. Since then, Frost has migrated his way to Denver, and told he should contact a local fixed going by the handle of ‘Red Tag’.
Frost, now in a totally unfamiliar environment, takes to running the shadows in the UCAS sector of Denver.

Heh, no I’m not that mean. Gremlins is a pretty painful quality though because you’ll often have to make checks to see if you glitch when success would otherwise be automatic (like checking your messages, ordering food, etc.). This is more for annoyance and comic relief than out right danger. Also you’re only going to suffer a negative result if you glitch or critical glitch. Any other character is also going to suffer some negative result on a glitch; you’re just more likely to glitch than a normal character. Though with Gremlins the result is likely to be more unusual or unexplainable. Your rank of Gremlins and how many 1’s you roll will determine how severe the glitch is.
Let’s take your example of firing a pistol with rank one Gremlins. For simplicity we’ll assume your dice pool is 8. That means you’ll glitch on result of at least three 1’s and a success (a 5 or a 6) or critically glitch on a result of at least three 1’s and no successes. A normal character would have to roll four 1’s to glitch. If your rolls were: 1,1,1,2,4,5,5,6 you’d have a normal glitch but could still potentially hit your target depending on his/her Reaction roll. In this case your shot would go off but the clip falls out or the safety gets stuck on, requiring you to spend an action to reload or fix it. However, had your rolls been something like: 1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4 you’d have critically glitched. In this case something more catastrophic would occur, like the gun completely falling apart. Thus it would be unusable until you have time to get it repaired. I’d only make the gun explode in your hand if you rolled a ton of 1’s and/or had a high Gremlins rating.
Does that explain things adequately?

Please play what you want to play. I'd prefer the challenge of catering to an unbalanced party than forcing people to play character concepts they don't prefer. If worst comes to worse you can always hire a magician for specific tasks. Alternatively I could have an NPC mage join the team.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Jin Arakaki**</span>
**Role:** Rock 'n' Roll Anarchist
**Race:** Human
Who would've thought that Jin Arakaki would've been such a big success? Surely not Jin. The third son of a lower-tier waste management worker, Jin spent most of his early life learning anything he could. He'd learned early he was especially talented in two things: music and martial arts. Honing his skills, when he was sixteen, he'd had enough and, packing his things, he headed out into the world to find his place. Well, the world wasn't ready for him. After dealing with one rejection after another, he realized that he needed work because, to his surprise, nuyen didn't grow on sakura trees. After answering an ad for a band, Jin found himself a founding member of *Kamikaze Kyo*, an electronic/metal fusion band that toured the clubs. What he didn't know is that the band mates were also runners that used their music as a front to take on jobs and, during one of their initial runs, they brought him along. Now here was something Jin could get into. Not only did it combine the skills he worked well at, but the recognition and nuyen started flowing his way finally. All was good ... or so he thought.
A few years later, after one of their gigs, the band was betrayed by one of their own. Right as they returned home from a run, they were raided by the Yakuza and killed. Well, everyone except for Jin ... and Mikata Uretesu, the Yaakuza mole that ordered the hit. Running for his life, Jin spent quite a bit to leave Japan behind him and head to the United States, vowing to one day return and gain vengeance for his band. Now, armed with his gear and guitar, Jin is ready to bring the rock back and to make heads roll ...
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**8-Bit**</span>
**Role:** Hacker and Game Junkie
**Race:** Dwarf
8-Bit's real name has become a bit of a mystery, even to 8-Bit himself. He remembers that he'd been in New York for some reason and that, when he woke up, he had all the gear he currently uses. Unsure of what to do, he started raiding the matrix, looking for any sign or reference of who he might be. The only reference he could find when matching his face to anything was something called "8-Bit", a retro-game server that he'd apparently worked on in his spare time. Digging a bit further, it seemed as though all signs pointed to Colorado. So, taking on the name "8-Bit" and gathering his belongings, he "bought" a ticket and hopped the first trip to Colorado in hopes of finding some clue as to who he is ...
Here's a few to choose from … I'm good with either <!– s:) –>![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!– s:) –> Might need some help making up which ever one though …

@Sketch: Looking good, I've got no problem helping out in the generation process. I particularly like Jin, though his potential lack of anonymity could be problematic for a 'runner. Does he wear stage makeup (like Kiss) when performing, try to hide his face on runs, or just let the chips fall where they may?
@Frost: Cool, though I'll need some more details on Jason Durden (any relation to Tyler Durden? :P). When did he develop his technomancer abilities? Did he use them in his legit job? Because that would probably bring some very negative attention down on him. Also don't forget that Aztlan got kicked out of Denver and the CAS absorbed their old territory. Though I suppose your fixer could be a holdout he might not be as useful as another fixer.
Can you explain Robert Frost's encounter with the bug shaman some more? I like it, I just want some more info since it's pretty important to the character. Did his entire former team die? Also is that his real name, and what he goes by in the shadows, or a handle?
Both of your characters would have had a SIN at one point. Consider taking the SINer quality or explain how they lost them.
@Everyone: I now have all the books thanks to Frost, so anything from them should be fair game (though keep in mind the limits on starting gear: no rating over 6 and no availability over 12). One exception, no sapient critters. I updated the original post to reflect this.

Nice work Magical, I really like the short stories. But...I do need some more info. :P

* Who is your enemy and what happened between you two?
* What part of Denver do you live in now?
* Marcus is still in NYC, correct? He can still be useful as a contact but he won't have as much knowledge on local stuff.
* Also I assume Marcus is your Eraser, yes?
* Do you have ties to any other Chaos mages or are you entirely self taught? Though obviously since you don't have one as a contact you don't have a useful working relationship.
* Were you born into poverty and thus never had a SIN, lose it in the Crash, or have Marcus erase it?

Also, your Initiative should be 7, it's Intuition+Reaction.

the enemy i wanted to 'work with'/'leave up to' you on
i have no idea, figured he would be a very fresh arrival
Marcus is still in NYC, and yes he's the eraser, and if there ever was a SIN he took care of it (he also provided the comlink Johnny has barely any use for lol)
as for Chaos mages: that was the tradition that fit him best so it would probably make more sense for him to be self taught
will update the initiative now

I would greatly prefer to work with you on it as opposed to making it up on my own. Right now I don't have enough to go on. Be thinking up some ideas and I'll try to meet up with you in the chat room to discuss it sometime.
I would like you to decide if your character was born with a SIN or not. Either way is fine but it does have some important effects on your character's background.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Background:</span>
Maeda Kanto was one of the, if not the best Yakuza enforcer in the late 40s and early 50s, though of course he didn't use that name, he was instead simply known as Kage or The Shadow. As a reward for his services Kanto received more augmentations, better augmentations and as genetech slowly gained more and more followers, Kanto eventually underwent procedures to make him stronger, faster and tougher.
Yumi was the result of a one-night-stand between Kanto and a prostitute, who figured that Kanto (who was widely known as being wealthy and influential in the Yakuza) would marry her if only she gave him a child. Instead it led to Kanto's anger and it was only the unborn child that kept her alive. Yumi witnessed her first death when she was mere minutes old as her father executed her mother.
Yumi never knew any other life than the one within the Yakuza. When her father died she was only a few years old and together with several other orphans of the Yakuza, she was put to work, learning the art of death, whether silent, bloody or simply quick or any variations thereof. Before she knew her ABC's she knew how to kill a man in a dozen ways.
As she grew older it became apparent that she was just better than the other potentials. Her genome was enhanced due to her father's heritage and at the same time she had inherited his potential. At the age of 12 she and the other potentials was told to kill the others of their group, which was meant to leave only the strongest. Yumi's first steps into adulthood was through a pool of blood of those she had called her friends and companions.
For a handful of years Yumi did what she was trained for. And she did it well. She went through several surgeries to enhance her, to make her a better killer, make her the best, like her father. Her muscles were replaced with biotechnically enhanced muscle tissue. Her entire nervous system discarded to make room for cyberware. These days Yumi isn't even sure how much of her is original and what has been replaced by something 'better'.
Yumi would still be killing for the Yakuza if it wasn't for the incident in September 2069. The Oyabun's son had already proven himself to be a pestilence, always leering at Yumi who truthfully didn't understand what he wanted. But this time he had been drinking heavily and with a couple of his just as drunk friends, they decided that they didn't take no for an answer. When Yumi was grabbed and they tried to force themselves upon her, she simply reacted before thinking and it wasn't until after she was returning the monowhip in her fingertip compartment that she realized that the Oyabun might be upset with her leaving his son in several parts.
After that Yumi fled the compound and for the next few months she moved around in Tokyo, trying to find a safe haven, but the enforcers found her within only days each time she moved. She grew more and more desperate, until she met an unlikely ally. A woman who introduced herself as Mrs. Aki offered to bring the young assassin to safety and in return Yumi would offer her services to Mrs. Aki and her friends. It didn't take many seconds before Yumi accepted.
Yumi still isn't sure who Mrs. Aki works for, she was smuggled aboard an unregistered private jet, which brought her to America, in particular to Denver, where Yumi was given a fake SIN in the name of Yakumi Kaede, a Japanese immigrant. She then got the newly minted Shadowrunner a contact with a half-Japanese full-criminal by the name of Johnny, who would be her supplier.
Unfortunately Mrs. Aki didn't provide any particular funds and Yumi hadn't brought much, which is how the assassin got in contact with the sleazebag Fat Tony, a loan shark who appears to be involved with the Mafia. She got herself a loan, which she quickly spent buying gear from Johnny. But now well-equipped, the young assassin is ready to make a name for herself as Fade...
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">
Appearance</span>
Standing 5'4 and being in her late teens. Fade doesn't look that impressive. She has asian features with short hair in a pixie haircut and brown eyes and most would overlook her in a crowd, since she has nothing that really distinguishes her face from most other asians. Perhaps what most would notice is how unemotional she may seem, very little seem to have any effect on her and it is only rarely that she smile. However underneath her clothing is a body that shows a lot of hard training, being rather muscular for a girl, though most rarely see this. When she's on the run she's almost always wearing a designer (armored) black suit including a tie, since she knows the importance of always looking professional.

## Re: Denver: City of Shadows - Casting Call

### **Snowkrash** (2010-07-02 14:13:03)

Name: Kristopher Vincent Jackson
Concept: Face
Race: Human
Ethnicity: Caucasian
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Background:
Kristopher grew up in the middle class ‘burbs under the lo-glow lights of Detroit. Hot house grown with all the steroid beef and soy food a kid could eat. At a young age, Kristopher began to feel a wanderlust; he needed to get out and see the world. Then, one day after his 18th birthday, he ran across a trid advertisement. “Join the Marines” the commercial said. “See the world” it said. “The Marines: Every meal's a banquet! Every paycheck a fortune! Every formation a parade!” Kristopher couldn’t wait to join. This decision came much to the disappointment of his parents, who were both working trid actors in the greater Detroit. They had hoped he’d apply talents much more constructively and go to college at Columbia. While he respected their wishes, he felt it was time for a challenge and a challenge the Marines presented. His induction and boot camp days were fairly unremarkable, well, as far as conditioning the human mind and body goes. After boot camp, he was designated for infantry. ‘No surprise there’ he thought. After AIT, that’s when things got interesting. He got stationed at an airfield near Chicago. ‘Chicago? I joined the Marines to LEAVE the UCAS, not stay in it’ he mumbled to himself. The duty station was a guard post for a private airfield, frequented by high level personnel. Day in and day out, he checked id’s, performed retinal scans, cross referenced credentials, field stripped weapons, and ate the same ‘unidentifiable’ crap every day in the mess hall. ‘Wish the place was built by the Seabees, at least they’d have put in a beer tent’ he muttered under his breath.
His life was about to change. A new base commander was due to take over for the previous 4 star who was being reassigned to shine a seat with ass in DC. The new commander, Col. Trenton Nicholas Tagg, his nickname was ‘TnT’, the Col thought because he was ‘dynamite’. The grunts called him that because he was a ‘fire-cracker’, all bang and no boom. Just when he thought this duty station couldn’t suck anymore, he got a new squad leader, Sgt. Richard Frost. Frost got the nickname, ‘Frosty’, partially because of his name, but also because despite what crap Tagg had the platoon due, Frost always kept his cool. Frost was a cross between Cal Ripken and Captain America. Jackson found out that unlike Tagg, Frost was a marine of his word. Tagg had a nasty way of instilling discipline and order by frequently locking down the camp so that no grunts were allowed off base for liberty. This was much to the chagrin of the troops there. Jackson told Frost, if Frost could swing a three day pass for the platoon off base, Jackson would make sure they’d have a good time. Frost pulled some strings and some how, Frost’s platoon managed to get a 3 day liberty pass to Milwaukee.
After a night of way too many drinks and war stories, the platoon had gotten themselves thrown in the drunk tank for being disorderly in public. They didn’t want to be drunk in public, they wanted to be drunk the bar. The troll owner and bouncer saw they to it they would no longer be drunk in bar and tossed them out into the street. Jackson was certain it had nothing to do with the riot they had started in the bar that night. The next morning, the owner wanted to press charges for the damage done from their ‘scuffle’ the night previously. Jackson told Frost he could get them out it, but he needed a moment alone with the owner, to smooth things over. Frost convinced the guards to let Jackson speak on their behalf, to make reparations for the damage they had caused. True to his word, Jackson managed to cut a deal with the owner, to not only drop the charges, but spring for the bail. Jackson was tight lipped about the whole thing afterwards and simply stated ‘you don’t want to know’. Jackson refused to divulge that owner was a female troll, who ‘negotiated’ for services at a later date. Frost was the only one Jackson ever told and he was under oath to never tell anyone, under pain of death.
From that point on, things did change; Frost had managed to win the hearts and mind of the platoon and Jackson became Frost’s unofficial ‘goto guy’. When Frost needed something done, he could count on Jackson to get it done. Things were really looking up for their platoon, so well in fact, Tagg had a ‘special mission’ for Frost and his men. The mission dossier stated that Frost and his team were to go in the zone and recover a downed helo’, it’s cargo and personnel and escort them back to base. Frost already had his suspicions about Tagg, but Tagg was a full bird, and in the Marines, you’re paid to follow orders not question their validity. The mission was going according to plan, go in, get the survivors, get the rendezvous point. On route to the base, the squad was ambushed. The first sergeant was killed in the initial fire fight, making Frost the next highest ranking officer. Frost ordered the troops to fall back to the secondary extraction point. Frost had heard stories of Marines that been lost in the zone, the nightmares those guys had seen. Frost told his platoon that wouldn’t happen to them, not today.
Within the hour a rescue team had been assembled and was in the air in what seemed like record time. The pilot for the rescue team, was someone loyal to Frost, he gave Frost the heads up the ‘TnT’ was on board to ‘oversee’ the mission personally. Frost knew that this was a death sentence. He told Jackson, if they were attacked, the backup plan would be to fall back to position near the wall. There, Frost would have another unit waiting to extract whoever made it back. He left Jackson that responsibility, when Jackson refused to leave, Frost explained that the rescue team coming for them, wasn’t coming for them, it was ‘coming for them’. Jackson reluctantly agreed and that was the last time Jackson saw Frost alive. Jackson led the team back to the wall and where another helo’ was waiting to extract the remainder of the team. The pilot explained as they left the zone, he had got word that Tagg’s rescue efforts were ambushed by the Human Brigade. That day several good marines lost their lives; many were listed as KIA or MIA. Frost’s body was not among those recovered.
A month had passed, several of the marines in that ambush came forward and told their story to an NCIS team; Tagg was brought up on charges, but due to his considerable rank and influence, he was able to walk away with an honorable discharge. After his tour, Jackson was reassigned to a peacekeeping force in New York and shortly thereafter, he was discharged to keep the whole matter quiet. Jackson continued his on ‘online courses’ at Columbia, just like his parents wanted, he major in communications, and then much to their dismay, turned his talents to ‘running’. For several months, he helped people get in and out of the zone in Chicago, one day hoping to catch word that Frost might be alive. Eventually, bigger scores and greater challenges lead him west into Denver. Six months later, Jackson while on a train to Denver, came across a story on a random net search. Apparently, someone made an attempt on Tagg’s life, though the attack was not fatal, Tagg was hospitalized and later transferred to undisclosed long term rehab facility. Since then, Jackson has had reason to believe that Frost may still be alive, somewhere, still really pissed at Tagg.
Jackson, a new transplant from Chicago, and has just started working as a freelance face in the UCAS sector. He’s offered his services as a team broker or runner consultant. Sometimes, he offers his services as hired muscle. People ask ‘why’, he replies with a shrug ‘You can take the marine outta the corps, but you can’t take the corps outta the marine.’
Personality:
Kristopher Jackson is man who is congenial, educated and well mannered. His appearance is well groomed, his clothes are pressed and his shoes polished. He’s been often mistaken for a ‘Johnson’ or a fixer, but in reality, he is just a good negotiator. Many people make the error that because he is so clean cut that he can’t possibly be a threat, and he fully uses that misconception to his advantage. If necessary, Jackson can be totally ruthless, because sometimes in this business you have to be. Fortunately, these situations don’t often come up and he is for the most part, a decent human.
Runners have come to trust him, Johnsons are wary of him and women love to hate him. He’s a deal broker, a live saver and heart breaker. He’s the ace you want up your sleeve, and your lucky charm. Jackson is the chummer who gets you paid and the one who delivers the pay back. Jackson is the runner you want by your side and not the gun at your back.
“Before you accept a quick check from a Johnson, check with Jackson.”

Well first off welcome to the site Snowkrash!
You're in with a few caveats. Your background doesn't quite jive with Frost's. Particularly the details of that fateful mission and the timeline. My understanding from Frost was that it happened not that long ago, hence why he has suddenly moved to Denver. Which brings me to my next point. I wanted all the characters to be newcomers to Denver. You've only been in Denver for a few days, a week or two at most.
Make those changes, work up his stats, and you're good to go. Note that you and Frost can and should collaborate on the background. You're welcome to make changes to the "established" story as long as you both agree.

## Re: Denver: City of Shadows - Casting Call

### **Valheru** (2010-07-06 00:01:03)

Snow: Looks good, the only problems are the ones Frost and I found with the character generator. You should have 18 Knowledge Points to spend, not 9 (the formula is [Logic+Intuition]x3). Perhaps spend them on Academic Knowledges to make use of your College Education? Also you need to buy an Operating System. For whatever reason one doesn't come standard with a commlink.
It's not exactly a problem but I noticed you didn't buy a fake SIN. Was that intentional? Your real SIN will obviously work for all the legitimate stuff but it could be a real detriment not to have a fake as well.
Oh, just noticed you don't have a Lifestyle though you seem to have over 10,000 nuyen left (assuming you spent 5 BP on money, otherwise you have 2 leftover BP). Remember you don't get to start with any leftover gear money, though you can buy multiple months worth of lifestyle. Your actual starting cash is based on your lifestyle.
Tethia: I've been lazy and am still going over Augmentation so...assuming you implemented all the new cyber/bio ware you're good with one exception. It looks like you spend 144 BPs on Active Skills, not 140. Perhaps you forgot to include the specialization costs?
Sketch: How's the character coming? I know you've got a lot on your plate right now, but I would like to get started soon. Just let me know if I can help.

Val, no you're right.
I was thinking about that this morning. The tool didn't calculate my knowledge skills right, I will fix that ASAP.
I did buy Low x3, however, I failed to copy that over from the tool. I ended up with 19,940 out of 20k. I will make sure that gets uploaded today.
No, I did not buy a fake SIN intentionally. No nuyen left over. I'll drop the Low x2, to a Low x2 or 1 and see what my resources are like afterward.
>> Okay updated. Let me know what you think.

## Re: Denver: City of Shadows - Casting Call

### **Valheru** (2010-07-06 23:41:52)

One thing that maybe isn't clear is that certain items are "Restricted" in terms of in-universe legality. If you want to carry them through any kind of security checkpoint or out in the open where a passing cop might see it you need a license. Otherwise they might (attempt) to confiscate the item or even arrest you. Obviously Shadowrunners tend to avoid legal scrutiny, but sometimes it's a whole lot easier to do it the legit way. My point is those of you that don't have them already might want to consider getting fake licenses to go along with your fake SINs. Especially for restricted cyberware, which can be detected by scanners and (usually) can't be left at home for obvious reasons. You need one license for each piece of gear. Also they're tied to one particular SIN, not every SIN you own. Fortunately they're pretty cheap. I suppose it's my fault for not pointing this out in the beginning but Denver has a lot of checkpoints because it is divided between four nations. All this being said you don't have to buy licenses if you don't want to.
In other news the game forum is up! <!-- m -->[http://www.galacticcampaigns.com/forum/ &#8230; .php?f=200](http://www.galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=200 "http://www.galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=200")<!-- m -->
Post approved characters in The Usual Suspects thread. I will be making the first game post soon after everyone has reposted their characters. Feel free to make last minute changes before we start, just let me know so I can look them over. Once we start play the only changes will be improvements bought with Karma.
Snow: Looks good. There's no price for real licenses in the game so you can have them for...100 nuyen but you have to go through all the red tape if you acquire one in game. Obviously you might still want fakes for your fake SIN. Unless you want to make any big changes you're approved.
Tethia: Unless I'm missing something your augmented Reaction should be 9. That's 4 base, 4 from Move-by-Wire II and 1 from Suprathyroid Gland. Genetic Optimization just raises your maximum score by one, not the actual ability. Actually...now that I look at it I don't think Move-by-Wire and the Suprathyroid gland stack. MbW specifically calls out Reaction Enhancers as the only Initiative booster it stacks with. Sorry. Of course you'll still get the bonuses to your other stats from the Suprathyroid, just not the Reaction bonus.
Magical: You're approved, though you might want to consider a fake Spellcasting license.
Sketch: Once you get your character done I'll insert you into the game at the earliest possible opportunity. Sorry to start without you.

With the Supra gland and MbW not stacking I'm not sure, I mean it is talking about initiative, not reaction.

## Re: Denver: City of Shadows - Casting Call

### **Valheru** (2010-07-07 14:25:20)

Magical: The same as other licenses, Ratingx100.
Tethia: I'm not 100% positive either but that's the way I'm going to rule it. Otherwise you'd have the bizarre effect of increasing your Reaction without increasing your Initiative.
Oh, one thing I forgot to mention. Include a brief physical description of your character: usual wardrobe, general looks, any distinguishing marks (scars, tatts, piercings, etc.), and anything else you feel is relevant. I already have a pretty good mental picture of most of the characters but I'd just like to make sure mine matches with yours because it will affect how some people respond to you.
Also, the casting call is now officially closed.

re: referred by snowkrash
Valheru-
I don't know if you're still looking for newcomers, but I'm a long time friend of snowkrash and he suggested I introduce myself to this campaign and to you. I'm new to pbp, but old to sr... and went thru the basic premise... overall the general concept we came up with is:
An amerind/meta ex military archetype. Now a 'freelance security specialist'. After his last mission, his mark was terminated and someone set him up with evidence pointing to him as responsible. Needless to say, he lost his other clientelle and had to leave his old venue. Hoping for greener pastures, he made overtures to various fixers and contacts and found them non-existent. So much for honor and friends among the shadows. Having no where else to go, he got a call from a fixer "friend of a friend" by the name of Red Tag about a job in Denver looking for new faces. Needing a new location and a job asap to help get creds to clear his name and find out who was behind it, he decides to take the job.
Does that sound like enough to start? If so, I'll have stats to you asap.
my name's Jeremy, and I'll have a character name to you should you have room and if I'm approved.
Thanks!

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-10-25 20:00:42)

Just for your knowledge Val, I was also starting to take an interest in this. Checked it up, and the system seemed familiar to some others I´ve read up on in the past, and I´ll probably make a character for ya soon. It´ll most likely be combat oriented, though in what way I´m not certain yet.

Great, glad to hear you guys are interested!
RoTaren that sounds good so far. However casting is not on a first come basis so go ahead and get the character ready once you get the chance. I know I have at least 3 people interested so the final selection won't be made until after everyone submits a completed character.

Do you have any general deadline for applications? I mean if you´re having some natural spot for inserting new players into the game coming up that you don´t want to miss. I think I´ve got the basic gist of how the system works, but it´ll take some time to find gear, abilities, skills, etc that best fits my character.
Oh, could you give a quick recap of what kind of characters you have at the moment?

---

### **Valheru** (2010-10-26 01:31:32)

Well like I said, I want to insert the new players in after the current mission is resolved. I don't know exactly when that will occur, but don't worry you have some time.
I originally thought about listing the existing party composition but left it out. I don't want people to feel they should or should not play a certain concept based on party balance. However, since you requested it...
Frost - A heavily cyberware enhanced ex-Marine, firearms expert
Johnny - A lascivious Chaos Mage with a penchant for mischief, magician
Jackson - A silver-tongued ex-Marine, face
Reth - An NPC hacker packing a lot of cyberware, tech
So the bases are covered but there's certainly room for overlap.

### **Anonymous** (2010-10-30 11:53:13)

Ok... so here's a quick breakdown of the character we had discussed earlier... He's a Troll from the Oglala Lakota Sioux Nation and was on a spiritual quest for his elders when he saw something that disturbed him on a vision quest. He joined the military and rose to the rank of sergeant in the Marines and was in a company dispatched similarly to handle the "Bug Crisis" like Frost and Snowkrash. After witnessing man's inhumanity to man, he decided to get out of the military when his tour was up and into private security. This worked ok for awhile, but he watched as people who didn't deserve to be protected (but who had creds) survived, and those more deserving didn't. He got cyber and bio implants to remain competitive, and IS a force to be reckoned with, but at the cost of his humanity. The last implant pushed him to the brink and when his last contract was terminated and he was framed for it, that sent him over the edge. He's decided to go the other way and punish the weak who seek to hide behind others. Hunting, instead of protecting those that should be hunted. Eventually he'll find those responsible for his frame-up, but given his attitude, he's just as likely to buy them a drink (for freeing him of his last restrictions - his humanity) as put a bullet in their head. "Why be humane, when you aren't human?" is generally his motto. He believes that only the strong will survive and although he's not 100% troll (thus his shorter than average height), he believes that as long as you try your hardest, you deserve to survive in the pecking order.
There will be more background to follow, but I wanted to get things "rolling" and supply a general background and rough draft character for you to go over. Thanks!

I've also been informed (by sources I won't name at this time), that "rough draft" is a poor name for a troll... that having been said, please take the name William "Billy" Red Thunder under advisement. Thanks!

---

### **Valheru** (2010-10-30 21:47:34)

Haha alright. I didn't even catch that was his name, just thought it was, well, a rough draft.
It looks good Rotaren. I'll go over it in detail tomorrow.

History:
William was born a human child to a pair of human parents in the Sioux Nation near Cheyenne in 2049. Both of his parents were full blooded Sioux Native Americans who could trace their ancestry all the way to Chief Sitting Bull. His particular ancestry took the lessons of Little Big Horn to heart. They realized that peaceful laissez-faire (or hands-off) attitudes when dealing with ‘enemies’ wasn’t going to work or be advantageous to the tribe’s survival. They practiced arts of a more warfare and tortuous nature, refining their arts and their weapons like surgeons on a battlefield. They developed a style and technique that was later adopted by the NAN and updated with other tactics, military techniques and weaponry that became the Wild Cats. His tribe has always had a rough and tumultuous nature, especially with the rite of manhood ceremony. Although the Sioux are primarily a matriarchy (the women controlling the home and tribe itself), the men are expected to show their physical prowess and strength (and worth in the tribe) by being great hunters and warriors. William was the “runt of the litter”, from an early age. Though he wasn’t born a troll, he ‘goblinized’ at puberty. It’s a derogatory term for him as he doesn’t see himself as a goblin. He was always thin and wiry and just slightly smaller than his fellows, a trait that carried over into his troll form. His speed, cunning and stealth were gifts that helped balance that out, but his true nature of being fierce despite opposition and his courage to carry on when others wouldn’t (i.e. – his competitive nature) made him stand out from the rest. The process took over eight months and was incredibly painful.
As he goblinized, he really took strides to ensure that his performance would not diminish; everyday he made sure to engage in therapeutic activities and when the goblinization had run its course, he had come out on top. Now he was larger than those that had made fun of him and much stronger and tougher than his human peers. After high school, he joined the NAN military as soon as he could to further his abilities and to learn 47 ways to kill a person with a wine cork. He was put through every hard ass test his instructors could throw at him and he took it all in stride, overcoming obstacles they all thought he’d never overcome. Surprising his commanding officers, he was recommended for the Wild Cats to see what he could do there. He was slightly smaller, and thinner – less “bulky” than his teammates, but his tenacity helped him hold his own. He is fast and usually quite stealthy which helps him evade situations other WC’s would just stand and take. This allowed him to be of other uses for missions requiring a little more subtlety than the average WC could muster. It wasn’t till he got his cyber and bio ware implants that he REALLY became a force to be reckoned with. He sometimes tries to regain his spirituality to appease his tribe, but as more and more of his features become foreign, he loses more and more of his humanity. The changes were subtle at first; he slowly lost his self identity by goblinizing at puberty, then each time he got an upgrade, he lost more and more pieces of ‘himself’. Each piece represented a move closer and closer to a much more competitive and evolved form.
Becoming mildly addicted to implants, he noticed that he was developing a keen edge to his skills, sacrificing willingly the last vestiges of humanity. All of it was replaced with the artificial promise of power and strength. He stated that during one of his surgeries that his spirit went on a vision quest, in which he simply stated ‘it made him take stock of his life and what was truly important’. He returned to his unit changed and distant, cold and emotionless. His squad mates began to take of notice of this change, and were somewhat taken aback by it. He started taking things (techniques, training and skills) much more seriously, but seemed to have a different outlook on life in general. It wasn’t till the WC’s were dispatched to Bug City on a joint operation with UCAS military that things began to unravel. During this mission he had a chance to see what the world was like outside the NAN; it was during this time that he met Sgt. Richard Frost and Corporal Kristopher Jackson. While their friendship wasn’t the warmest or the strongest, they would on occasion contact one another to swap war stories, go out for occasional drinks etc, etc. Soon after Bug City, William decided to leave the military and start a new life.
While his career was not stellar, it was mildly decorated, etc. (nothing dishonorable), which opened doors into the private sector security. He became a freelance security specialist; he landed several large corporate contracts where he was hired as security details for mid level execs and others who were able to afford his services. He used this temporary wealth to fund (after building a very sizable contingency trust) the remainder of his surgeries. Most people underestimate him due to his size, that and the fact he’s a troll, but they soon find that he is a marvel of modern science, who’s hand to hand attacks are among the most lethal in the world.
His clientele have included some high ranking execs, a few celebrities and a few (unnamed) sovereigns. You would think this would be an interesting line of work, and when he was working, it was. He liked being back in the thick of action, but grew weary of rich people’s pretentiousness, especially when following ‘their’ basic tenants of security protocol. This annoyance eventually blossomed into a pure distaste for those with wealth and power and in people in general. He felt it was a waste of both his time and their money. He realized that he was protecting the wrong people. He was protecting people unworthy of their money and status, rather than people who mattered in life, people of real substance.
His last mission was protecting the son of a corporate exec that was being targeted by a business rival. He got the kid to his destination fine and completed the job. A few hours after he was dismissed and relieved of his duty, the mark was hit. He later found out someone had planted evidence and information leading back to William as a conspirator in the boy’s death. He knew this would compromise his reputation, not to mention his clientele. It was in this instance that he found a moment of clarity of mind; he had in fact an epiphany. Instead of protecting those because of the fame and fortune they had, he would right a fundamental wrong; he would use his talents to bring order and justice to a world gone mad. Some would say he’s gone insane, and perhaps to a degree has; he lives by a new creed: “Why be humane, when you aren’t human?”
He wants to find out who ruined his career and why; William has found himself looking for work for far too long. He’s decided that his whole ordeal has helped free him of his last remaining obstacle: his “humanity”. Humanity, that thing which keeps most people from walking into a board meeting and killing everyone in it. So, he might just as soon buy whoever it was a drink, rather than kill them. At this point, only time will tell. He was near rock bottom and was looking for work outside of his area since his clients (like his so-called friends) dried up when news of the kid’s termination hit the ‘net. With the few remaining people he knew, William got introduced to a fixer by the name of Red Tag, who for the most part worked out of Denver. He decided a change in venue would be in order, and perhaps it would take his mind off of obsessing over things he can’t change, not right now at least. William is unaware that his UCAS Marine buddies are in Denver. Change isn’t all bad.
Interesting side note: During the “Test of Manhood”, a week-long ritual in which physical, mental and spiritual contests are observed, William overcame all others to emerge victorious. He claimed his name (and his birthright) when he felled his last opponent during an unexpected storm. He raised his hand in the sign of triumph just as lightning struck behind clouds at sunset, creating an eerie red thunder across the landscape.

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

There was a time when Scandinavia boasted some of the most feared warriors in Europe. The mere sight of their longboats would cause fear and the promise of pillaging and ravaging to spread through the lands. The warriors themselves fought without fear and mercy, killing anyone that stood in their way, oblivious to both pain and prayers, and said to only be stoppable by death itself. And when they finally fell in battle, they would be taken into the embrace of the Valkyries and brought to the eternal feast in Valhalla, the hall of Odin, greatest of the Aesir gods. Here these warriors, these Berserks, would await the time when they were called upon to fight alongside the gods in the final battle, Ragnarok.
Even now, centuries later, the ideals of these fierce warriors remain in the North, though they have in much adapted themselves to the realities of modern warfare. A few decades ago, a secret program was organized, meant to combine the powers of modern biotechnology and the powers of the old gods to recreate the powers of the great Berserks. Trained, bioengineered, whipped and sculpted into shape, these warriors became an elite force of reckon, nothing short of one man armies. Some exemplary specimen, who showed natural aptitude for combat, had extraordinary physique, or were just naturally suited for combat were raised above the others and given further training and more advanced gear. These expert soldiers were codenamed using terms from old Norse mythology, and first among them all stood he who became known as the Fenrir. Named after the great wolf that will devour Odin at the coming of Ragnarok, this stealthy hunter was the first to acknowledge the true purpose of this supersoldier program.
They had not been created to protect their homelands from harm, but rather to be sold as elite agents by corrupt politicians to the highest bidder. Not quite comfortable, the Fenrir grudgingly accepted the situation, intent on maintaining his honor. He would do the work of his employers, the criminal syndicate Duskflame, though he would refrain from killing when it was not necessary, intimidate rather than hurt, and generally behave in a way hat would not cause harm to innocents. This however would not sit well with his bosses, who considered him their purchased property, a paid for weapon, and wanted to unleash his full potential.
To do this, they sent him on a mission to slaughter an entire family of innocent people. None of them had done anything wrong, but his boss wanted them dead as an example to show the citizenry that only active support of their syndicate was tolerated, and that indifference was the same as being against them. To make sure that his agent completed his task, he sent along a platoon of soldiers, ordered to kill him if he hesitated at any moment. They had, however, sadly underestimated the capacity of the soldier. In a matter of moments, his watchers lay dead at his feet, and without even a look at the family whose life he had just saved, he vanished into the night.
Now, sold by his homeland and the people who made him what he was, and an enemy of one of the largest criminal syndicates in Europe, which he knew to have connections to the rest of the world, he didn´t really see that he had anyplace to go. Forging himself a fake identity, he assumed the name of Heimdall, the White God and guardian of the path between men and gods, and sets out to make himself a new life. He continues to act as a mercenary, though this time voluntarily, and with his own choice of employers. He takes a particular pride in assisting law enforcement agencies and structured armies in the destruction of organized crime, and charges very little for his services.

Hey guys, I´m sitting down to finish this character once and for all finally. I´m sorry for the delay, but I had a hectic period recently, plus I´m finding it so d**n hard to put this character together. I´ve got most of it made out, and have checked a bit on your characters, but I just thought I´d ask you directly if there´s anything you´d like to see in my character. You´ve got pretty much the concept above, in case you want to look at it.

hey DA, just in case you missed it, attacks (even melee) are agility based. Strength only governs damage.

Yup, I noticed. I´ll be using Bioware/Adept powers to raise it above 2.

cool, i know that was a mistake i made first time i played SR. massive bad a$$ troll who couldn't hit a damned thing cause nobody pointed that out to me lol.
this part is more personal preference but your skills seem kinda scattered. if thats what ya want cool, but you could look at the other chars for an idea of what's covered and what isn't and how the frost and Krash spent their points, they been in this long time.

Yeah, I guess my biggest mistake was not asking you guys about help from the scratch. I´ve been busting my brain at some times trying to figure out how to build the character.
I´m generally a guy who likes a lot of bases covered in basics, but some of the skills, like Athletics and Outdoors, are simply so I don´t have to default on them.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-12-09 13:41:18)

Here we go. I´ll convert it into a web-based format as soon as I have the time, but for now this will have to do, since I wrote it in a document locally.

### **Valheru** (2010-12-10 18:53:21)

Looking good guys, though I have yet to go over the characters with a fine tooth comb. A couple things I noticed right off the bat though.
DA: You can't break up skill groups at character generation. If you buy them as a group they're all at the same rating...sorry. In play you can choose to focus on one skill out of a group by spending Karma. Also, I didn't see a fake SIN on your sheet. While not strictly necessary it will make your life a hell of a lot easier so I'd recommend you pick one up.
RoTaren: I ruled earlier on Fade (Tethia's character) that the Suprathyroid Gland and Wired Reflexes don't stack because Initiative enhancements are mutually exclusive unless an exception is specifically mentioned. You still get all the other benefits but your Reaction would only be a 3 instead of a 4. Also while you are a SINner you should consider a fake SIN as well.
I have yet to hear anything from the other interested party so it looks like you two are in!

### **Anonymous** (2010-12-13 11:17:16)

ok. well... for my character a change from 4-3 isn't going to change history, so that's fine... and I'll look at the fake SIN right away... thanks!

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-12-14 19:08:43)

OK, this time I hope he fits in with all the rules. I switched out a few other things as well, most notably buying myself a vehicle, since it seemed like pretty much everyone else had one.
