*Castia was once a proud kingdom, its boundaries stretching from the Northern Forest south to the farmlands surrounding Lake Tarsis and east to the Teerna Sea. Legends claim that for centuries it was ruled by a line of wise kings who sought only safety for their subjects and peace with their neighbors. Bards still sing of this golden age, reminding all of what life was like in a land of joy deep in their memories. Because memories seldom whisper of anything other than beauty when waking eyes see only the mark of evil upon the land…
You have found the key to the Vault of Lorna Fields. Legends tell of a hidden treasure horde to the east of Lorna Elon. When the key is held at the Crossroads under the light of the full moon the entrance will be revealed. Some legends speak of great wealth; others though make it less glamorous. Whispering of dark monsters held fast until the ancient line of kings would offer mercy and freedom if the beasts accepted a truce. Those still held refused such a punishment.* (pp.24, 25 **Mini Six Bare Bones Edition**)<div style="text-align: center;">

Those are excerpts from both the main campaign background and the scenario I intend to run. It'll be a relatively straightforward dungeon crawl with a few twists here and there but I can't say more until I know the number of players and have a loose idea of what kind of character they'll be playing. The necessary races/skills are included in the book on pages twenty-four and twenty-five. We'll use the **Fast Static Combat** and **Body Points** rules, and don't forget you can start with one free item applicable to each skill. You're free to request more from me but I reserve the right to refuse or make you earn it somehow (swap another item out, RP buying it, etc.). Anything else you want for RP purposes (clothes, books, pets, jewelry, etc.) is fine. Characters will begin in the region of Kauleshan to the North - a cold, mountainous land called home to a hearty, simple people. As far as who found the Golden Key and how - I'll include it in the first post (no one will start with it).
I don't intend for this to last forever - a few months at the most. As such, I would suggest a post frequency of "*fairly often*", even if they're shorter posts, so we can get to the real meat and potatoes of the story before Christmas plans start to take place. For myself, I will keep things moving and can commit to a minimum of two posts/week, likely heavier on Friday and Saturday nights. If it's easier, and everyone agrees, we can try to have a chat session through the site if/when it becomes appropriate. We'll assess things at the conclusion and see if it might be possible to continue with a second scenario but no promises. Have fun making your characters, ask any questions in this thread, and we'll aim for a start date of **November 17th**!
Here's the link to the rules: [http://www.antipaladingames.com/p/mini-six.html](http://www.antipaladingames.com/p/mini-six.html "http://www.antipaladingames.com/p/mini-six.html")

Great! I'll leave the CC up for a week before I set anything in stone. Any requests/comments/suggestions/requests? I'll just whip up a little something we can enjoy during the the next month or two. I've never actually played with this system but it doesn't look too hard to casually muddle our way through a little adventure. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Excellent! As I said before, feel free to start working on a character you'd *like* to play, based on the requirements for the scenario contained in the rulebook - the sooner I know who is playing what, the better idea I'll have about how to tailor the experience. I tend to be pretty easy-going in terms of originality in builds so it never hurts to ask!

### **KUPALISSSS** (2012-11-12 09:52:28)

If the elf race is available for play, I'd like to play an elven wizard. I will try come up with the build and background later.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-11-12 19:25:21)

The setting doesn't specifically mention or prohibit elves, so I'll allow it. That perk has bonuses *and* restrictions though - a limit on your **Might**.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2012-11-13 12:31:56)

Thanks for the info BW!
Does the perk's Might attribute limit refer to starting attribute limit or would it be like an attribute cap wherein it can't be increased beyod 3 using CP? If it's the latter, does it mean the Agility can't be raised beyond 5?
Can wizards use armors and shields in this system?
Here's my intended build so far:
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**Character Name:** Solkanus Shaer'tahlian
**Quote:** For your own good, leave me be.
**Appearance:** Lithe in stature and moves with unearthly grace. He exudes an aura of menace which makes most people jittery in his presence. An air of mystery in his person further accentuated by the cloak which hides his features. The only notable feature is a tattoo of an ornate compass on the dorsum of his right hand.
**Personality:** Having survived an abduction with no recollection of what was done to him, Solkanus is distrustful of others. He is always wary bordering paranoia, keeping an eye for the crimson cloaked enemies. Detached, always wants to be left alone, it will be very hard for him to earn friends. However, he has a soft spot to those he sees as victims of circumstances beyond their control and he will lend assistance to those he deems truly in need.
Though quiet most of the time and surly when he have to speak, he has a habit of blurting out a cynical comment here and there.
**Age:** 127 **Sex:** Male **Height:** 1.9 m **Weight:** 60 kg
**Body Points:** 32
**ATTRIBUTES/SKILLS**
**Might:** 2D
**Agility:** 5D
**Wit:** 4D
--- **Magic:** 6D
**Charm:** 1D
**PERKS**
Elf (2)
Sorcerer (3)
**COMPLICATIONS**
Enemies
White Wizard
**STATIC DEFENSES**
**Dodge:** 15
**Block:** 6
**Parry:** 6
**Damage Resistance:** 0
**Character Points:** 0
**Hero Points:** 1
**Gear:**
**The Cloak, minor** (grants +1D to the Magic skill test required to use the Fly and Teleport spells.)
Knife
**Spells:**
Charm
Fly
Shape Change
Slumber
**Background:**
Solkanus was born and raised in a sizable elven community between Lorna Elon and Devmorra. He was a jovial person and quick to make friends.
When he reached adulthood, his talent for sorcery surfaced and was immediately apprenticed to the well-known wizard Tranar. It was during his tutelage when he discovered that he could not harm anyone with his magic. He could not establish if this is a psychological limitation wherein he subconsciously fails his spell when trying to harm others or if his magic is just simply different. Even his master is at a loss. Nonetheless, he continued his study in the arcane arts and concentrated on spells affecting himself.
A life changing event occurred when he was abducted by crimson cloaked adversaries during one of his adventures with his master. He woke up a year later in the wilderness near Kauleshan with no recollection on what happened to him after his abduction. His only remembrance was the ornate compass tattoo which seemed to emanate a crimson glow when he works his magic.
Henceforth, he’d become distrustful of others. This attitude is somehow intensified by the feeling that he’s being watched and the rare occasion that he catches a glimpse of a crimson blur in the corner of his eyes.

I believe they are referring to character creation - which is the duration of this scenario anyway. If you earn points and someone decides to continue with another, then I think you'd be allowed to increase beyond those limits. It's not exactly clear but I think that's the spirit of what they're trying to say... although I could totally see where a GM wouldn't allow you to increase beyond that limit ever, seeing as your bonuses definitely don't have limits (you won't stop seeing in the dark, for instance). Stick to those limits for now.
> Can wizards use armors and shields in this system?

Yes they can, but remember that starting gear is only allowed during character creation if it relates to a skill you have selected. I'll allow the cloak because you allocated 2D to the magic skill, and because it's appropriate for your character...
**…however…**
a) I'm nerfing it to be a +1D to *Flying* and *Teleport* because it's supposed to be something special that you make and acquire and put effort into.
b) Choose either the *White Wizard* complication, **or** use only a maximum of 5D for skills instead of the ordinary 7D. Your choice (if you still want it).
As far as the *Hunted* complication goes, I'm going to say no. It's a unique part of the setting (which is otherwise pretty basic fantasy stuff) and rest assured you will earn more than a few enemies soon enough anyway. I never tell my players they *can't* play a particular build, but I do point out when I foresee problems. You've chosen a pretty "loner" type wizard - but this is intended to be a party game. That can create conflict when you have a group of adventurers that includes an "aloof...detached, quiet" member. I recommend fleshing that out a little more - give him a soft spot for Brownies and Hannedyn, or a weakness for helping others even though he might try and play all high and mighty later on, etc. Something allows him to be true to your build intentions but which doesn't alienate him right off from everyone else he meets. Even Gandalf couldn't figure out the how to open the door to Moria - it was "only" a Hobbit who did that.
Still plenty of time for others to join in!

Thanks for the insights.

Actually, you're quite generous. <!-- s:)) -->![:))](https://i.ibb.co/ZRrbtNtj/icon-razz.gif)<!-- s:)) --> I was just about to ask for a spell book. Many thanks! <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I think I'll stick with the White Wizard complication. I never visualized my character as someone blasting with lightning or fireball.
> As far as the Hunted complication goes, I&#39;m going to say no. It&#39;s a unique part of the setting (which is otherwise pretty basic fantasy stuff) and rest assured you will earn more than a few enemies soon enough anyway.

No problem on this. I'll just select the Enemy complication.

You&#39;ve chosen a pretty &quot;loner&quot; type wizard - but this is intended to be a party game.

I guess I'll have to put more effort in fleshing out my character. Maybe I should also work on my background 'coz it could add more character depth and could explain his personality.
Hopefully I could find time to do this over the weekend.

### **BWS2K** (2012-11-15 19:25:00)

Thank you for choosing *Enemy*, I'll be sure to use that against you at the most inopportune time... <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
And I wouldn't sweat the background anymore than you want to, a paragraph is sufficient for what we're doing - I just wanted you to be aware that you quote (for instance) describes a character who seems less likely to fit into a party. The main game I ran on here last year went fairly well with everyone in solo threads, but when it came to putting them together I couldn't really orchestrate having a Jedi work with an assassin droid known to have killed Jedi during the Clone Wars without making the situation seem corny. It wasn't so much that we *couldn't* make it happen as much as it just wasn't really true to the characters... if that makes sense. You can be a crotchety old wizard that hates almost everybody but just be prepared to get over that a bit to accomplish this goal somehow. If he's not the kind of character to harm others, for instance, he may have to tolerate - maybe even *appreciate* - having someone else along who isn't restricted in that way in order to successfully finish this mission. That's all.
**Duggs** is still in too - but there's still plenty of room for others!

### **BWS2K** (2012-11-16 07:34:42)

I just sent **Alicia** the forum request so we should have a forum up soon. I couldn't come up with a really neat campaign name, despite usually being rather witty, so you'll have to forgive me for that. I'll setup the Main thread, an OOC section, and a Characters thread sometime this weekend. As far as character sheet formats... do whatever seems appropriate. As long as everything is included I'm cool with it. I have Sunday night off from work so I hope to get a good introduction up then. Cheers!

When he wasn't working on his trade he spent his time in the local tavern drinking and getting into the occasional barfight. One day he decided that there had to be more out there and he decided to head out on his own and try to make his own life for himself, plus there had to be numerous types of ale out there.

**Character Name:** Haer'Dalis
**Quote:** Behold the power of the dragon!
**Appearance:** A young man of above averagely fit build, though without showing it with bulging biceps or rock-hard abs. He is fairly tanned and shows the signs of a constant traveller, such as a weathered face and somewhat ragged clothing which consists of a pair of loose-fitting trousers and a plain shirt covered by a rugged and worn travellers coat with a high standing collar. He usually walks with light luggage: A few pouches on his belt, a knife, a bow with quiver, and a walking staff. One particular trait that he has that is usually covered by the sleeves is a pair of tattoos of serpent dragons coiled around his forearms.
**Personality:** Normally a rather calm and friendly fellow that gets along with others easily, his personality can generally be seen as shifting all over the place. He might suddenly become reckless, thinking himself invincible and unbeatable. At other times he can become arrogant and proud, and loudly berate people for not trusting his wisdom and better judgment. And a whole other bunch of such changes. Somewhere, it all comes down to the fact that he thinks himself the mortal incarnation of a great dragon, something others can generally find hard to believe. Still, as he displays almost supernatural prowess in various tasks on occasion, perhaps there is some truth to his claims?
**Age:** 25 **Sex:** Male **Height:** 1.8 m **Weight:** 87 kgs

Leather Armor
**Background**
With origins unknown (no one is sure if he himself remembers actually), Haer'Dalis spends most of his life on the road, traveling across the world. Why he travels, only he knows, but it could be the fact that he leaves the occasional trail of destruction behind him that keeps him from settling down. Also his belief that he is, in fact, the incarnation of a great dragon spirit draws him to continuously search for new purpose in his life, hoping to one day find the reason he was placed in this world. Currently, he has made forays into the north, a place he has largely avoided thus far, but that will now know his presence (for good and worse)...
**A few notes**

* I haven´t really chosen any explanation for his Skeletons in the Closet complication, feeling that I could leave that up to you. But basically the idea is that he has been traveling around quite a lot, and occasionally things haven´t worked out too well. He might have accidentally set something on fire, or perhaps even killed someone in a fit of rage for challenging his "dragon" powers. Basically, there could be any number of things that can come back to bite him, it could be as simple as the rumors of him have preceded him, affecting peoples attitude towards him.
* With the "Creatures" specialty of Lore I meant that he would be familiar with most creatures of the world, having traveled a lot and encountered and heard of many of them.
* I hope the gear is OK. The only things really not related to any skills is the knife and the armor. The knife is carried more as a tool than a weapon, and I figure some sort of armor would be fine.

Updated my character concept...
Added background and expounded on the personality which I hope will be playable. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
Questions/Clarifications:
1. The White Wizard complication states that I can't harm anyone with my magic. Fireball, lightning, curse etc. are definitely out. How about Shape Changing? Since I am the target of the spell, this should not be an issue. Let's say I transform into a troll then attack an enemy, I assume I can still harm him. How about Slumber? Putting an enemyto sleep doesn't necessarily harm him/her but I consider this a grey area so I had to ask.
2. Since I can't directly harm anyone with my magic, can I request a knife?
Thanks!

### **BWS2K** (2012-11-17 20:04:58)

1. I think that's stretching things a bit too far. Shape changing into a troll to scare someone though, or too block a path with boulders, or to become more resistant to their attacks, etc. - that seems more like what they had in mind. Just because *you* know you can't harm anyone doesn't mean *they* know, and I can't imagine many folks are willing to argue with a guy who transforms into a troll at will. You'd replace all your attributes with the news ones though, and gain any perks/weaknesses. I can't find the definition for *regeneration* anywhere in the book (it's a small book, mostly GM interpretation of some things), so I'd say it means every round you're not at full health means roll half of your Might to regain hp. That'd be 3D for a troll - *but you still keep your own maximum body points* so we're not re-calculating all the time. And all your clothes that you're wearing will be fine. Keeping the skill active is 1 action too. All in all - it *is* a grey area sometimes with these rules, so we'll just take it as it comes. I think Putting an enemy to sleep is definitely okay though, and could lead to some really interesting combat results...
2. (see below)
**All**: I'm sorry - the body points rules say to roll your Might and add 20. I didn't check the math on that part for your characters, just take the maximum. If you have 3D Might, for instance, you have 38hp. Also - this is a fantasy setting, and if you all want to start with a *knife* for free, that's fine. I say this because it makes sense, and because I know what sorts of baddies are in store... <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
I usually sleep during the day and I have some company coming over tomorrow (unexpected family) and spending the night, but I plan to work on the first post between Sunday and Monday. If all goes well, you can expect an introduction to be up Monday morning. Also expect to have a fairly straightforward "tavern" start to the adventure, but I won't say more than that. It's not too late to join, though depending on when I get the message you may have to wait a bit to join the party!
