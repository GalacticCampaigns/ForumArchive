# Clone Wars Adventures

### **Alicia** (2011-04-21 02:26:29)

I'm of the mind to put together a Clone Wars time frame campaign with two or three players. Most likely middle or near the end of the conflict. It would be a mix of solo or full party adventuring depending on the characters.
If I get more interest I can put something more together as far as specifics but a lot of it would again be dependent on the characters and their ultimate motives.
I ask anyone interested think about and give me an idea what sort of character and game you'd like to play. Just as a note I'm not a huge fan of militaristic style though I'd do my best to provide it if called for.

While I wouldn´t mind being part of some hardcore "Republic Commando" action, I think that works better for a dedicated game, or at least a GM who´s really into that kind of action.
I can probably take a shot at playing any kind of character, but I´d really like to take the chance to play a Jedi Commander. And if we´re set near the end of the war, it´ll be nice to actually get to try and survive Order 66, rather than just playing a Jedi who already have survived it, which is the more common. It could work both as a solo adventure or a group one, depending on what other peoples want to play.

i wouldn't mind taking a stab at the other side of the coin: playing a separatist. Bounty Hunters and mercs abound, and droids too. wealthy independence seekers on missions to convert worlds, whole nine yards. maybe even one of palpatine's elite pawns like grievous or ventress could be a blast to play.

You know, I could see quite an interesting "counter-op" story developing after the execution of Order 66, with one player being a fugitive Jedi on the run, and another being the Bounty Hunter/Dark Pawn on his trail. Especially if it were made at some higher levels, so the characters are more capable.

I agree. Could be rather interesting. I think I'd like to get pairs together if a split faction game is agreed upon.
Let's see what other ideas are out there.
As for level I'm thinking 4 or 5 using my creation rules from Growing Shadows.

If we were to go with the previous suggestion, I´d like to request a somewhat higher level like 7-8. It just feels like a more appropriate level for a Jedi allowed to be his own commander in the wars. Plus, it makes for more interesting abilities to use after the war ends <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
For other ideas, I´d be willing to perform any kind of criminal activity, like piracy or smuggling or something similar. Such activities tend to thrive during periods of great war. We don´t have to be "bad guys" either, we could be privateers hired to raid CIS ships, or maybe blockade runners, running supplies to besieged worlds.
I can probably spawn more ideas if you like.

I can play pretty much anything.
DarthAnthrax's idea sounds like it would be a load of fun to play. Especially if it's kind of like the Coruscant Nights quadrilogy.

I've got two characters going already and I'm trying to get a handle on running an *Eclipse Phase* game, but I'm totally intrigued by the idea of living through **Order 66** as DA suggests. I don't think I could join the main party, but if you need someone to play fodder or recurring characters I can help out occasionally.

Just as an observation...the way you battle, you are about to have **1** character running <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Okay *wise guy*, I didn't say it but I'm glad someone else mentioned it. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
If my Arena character bites it then I would be willing to join this game for sure. Two characters at a time is enough for my brain though, and doing anything and reading through EP at the same time is tough. I'd be willing to play whatever fits.
