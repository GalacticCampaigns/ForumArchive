# [Reb] Infinities: Killer of the Stars

### **ArcanaFang** (2011-06-29 17:50:15)

The Rebel Alliance is weak and on the verge of collapse. After losing most of the founders to the blades of Darth Vader and the Emperor himself, most of the Alliance supporters doubt and fear that a Rebellion
Starkiller was used to rally the Rebel Alliance up, discover how deep the organization ran, and eradicated the heads of the system. Once he met his own twisted ends by killing his former master, Starkiller attempted to kill the Emperor as well, only to be decimated and left at the mercy of the Dark Lord of the Sith himself.
With his life belonging to the Emperor, Starkiller serves his new master and hunts down the remaining ends of the Rebellion he seemingly created.
After intercepting and detaining the Tantive IV, Starkiller has managed to capture a suspected Rebellion leader named Garm Harbin. After the interrogation and execution of Harbin, Starkiller learns that two droids are carrying plans for the Death Star. In his attempt to recover the plans, he makes his arrival on Tatooine...
(SPOILER ALERT - IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THE FORCE UNLEASHED DLC OR THE GAME, PLEASE READ NO FURTHER)
The game focuses around Galen Marek and his choice to kill Darth Vader instead of facing the Emperor in the ending events in the first Force Unleashed game. After this choice, Starkiller is damaged beyond bacta repair by the Emperor and is grafted with the same type of machine-aided living that his master, Darth Vader had. Before, I wanted to let the downloaded content to be before the roleplay itself, but I find it much more interesting to weave each little part of it into this timeline, further developing the player characters and this Infinity universe.
So simple and straight, this campaign will roughly take place during the first DLC mission, which finds the players on the planet of Tatooine. The Alliance has just made a strike from their hidden base and have retrieved the plans for the Death Star and hidden them within the droid R2-D2, who is followed by C-3PO. Players will take the role of Rebels or hired mercenaries for the Alliance who are in possession of said droids and are trying to get them off the planet. The game will begin at the hidden base just beneath the streets of Mos Eisley, where the heroes will meet up with a commander within the Rebel Alliance.
Here's the basic's of character creation...
Level: Characters start at Level 5...because 1 isn't epic enough!
Books: Use all books, but please explain feats/talents or anything that you may use...as I don't have all the books.
Points: 36
Destiny/Background: (I'm using Alicia's alternative rule which is this:
Instead of choosing a Destiny you will instead choose a Background. The Background will work as normal depending on whether Event, Occupation or Origin is chosen. Every odd level you will gain 1 Destiny point instead of 1 every level. Additionally, there are no longer any Destiny bonuses aside from those afforded by talents and other uses of Destiny Points. On occasion, the GM may see fit to award additional DPs for heroic actions or other exceptional deeds.
Credits: All characters shall start with 20,000 credits. (I use this number based on Alicia's cost, and besides, gives you PLENTY of money to choose some good equipment I believe, as well as a favor or something...) Not sure about equipment? Ask.
Class: Any class may be used, although since this is Rebellion Era, Jedi or Force user must have a little bit of secrecy.
Starting the Campaign: You shall be part of the Rebellion, meeting on the planet of Tatooine. I would like really good characters for this...so lets see what you got!!!

As an aside, I ignore everything related to the Mandalorians from the Clone Wars cartoon and follow Karen Travis's perception of them. If that's a problem, let me know. Depending on how many Melee combatants we have, I may trade out Precise Shot for Careful Shot.<div style="text-align: right;">

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Marina had escaped to Telos a few months after Order 66 had been initiated to rendeavous with her master Silas Draay. When he failed to appear she tried to hire herself as a mechanic in the hopes of leaving the planet before she was discovered. It was while she was working on a cargo transport that she met Storn. The crew had been taking shore leave when he came to capture his mark, another member of the crew. Unaware as to what the man had done she tried to defend her crewmate and ended up revealing herself as a Jedi. That day Storn captured his mark and Marina. He wasn't able to hold Marina for long as she managed to escape. Impressed by her ingenuity, Storn offered her a place on his ship. Having no where else to go, she agreed rather reluctantly.
Several months later, Marina and Storn were married; the Mandalorian way. Marina become a mercenary working alongside her husband, though they usually ended up working for almost nothing. Marina learned she was pregnant and wanting to reunite her family sent for Nadia who was being raised on an agrarian backwater planet on the Outer Rim called Iruji. Storn readily accepted Nadia as his own daughter since blood didn't matter to the Mandalorians. Settling on the Imperial occupied Madalore, Marina hoped to hide her family in plain sight from the Empire. Starting a farm on the outskirts of Enceri, they taught their children the Mandalorian and Jedi ways, though Nadia was Marina's only child to show any affinity to the Force. This fact put a strain on Nadia's relationship with her mother, especially when Nadia eloped with her husband when she was fifteen. The two never resolved their differences and Nadia began to go on jobs with Cander as a bounty hunter. A year later, Nadia had a son, Korbin.
The year Nadia turned eighteen Marina left to give her support to the fledgling Rebellion. Unfortunately, the leaders were betrayed by Garin Starkiller who killed Darth Vader and took his place, destroying the Rebellion in its infancy. Marina was caught in the onslaught and killed. When Nadia learned of her mother's death, having felt it through the Force, she was enraged and it was only Storn's consolations which kept her from running off for revenge against the Empire right then and there. Instead she and Storn left to reclaim what they could, returning only when they had her remains to burn. The two spent several long months trying to track down Marina's remains, but soon they were discouraged and not wanting to draw attention themselves gave up the hunt. Nadia returned, dissatisfied, to her home and attempted to return to her life as a dutiful wife and mother.
Cander and Nadia have a house (yaim) about a mile or so away from the yaim where Nadia grew up. Vhey' yaims are traditionally small fortresses built half underground and are camouflaged into the surrounding terrain. Sometimes they can be only one building meant for temporary habitation, but the yaims like the Skirata's and Bralor's is a multi building affair built around a central building meant to be a common area. Her childhood home, the Skirata's, even include a small armory and a secret underground tunnel for a quick escape from the house.
((I'll add more here once I have a better idea of what's going on to start.))

**Description**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The proud Mandalorian's armor is dark blue-black in color accented with silver contrasts where her vacuum sealed jumpsuit is revealed beneath the metal plates. Nadia is of an average height, being no more than 1.6m and though its hard to tell, beneath the armor she has a slim yet muscular build.
With a snap hiss of released air, the proud warrior beneath the helmet is revealed. Appearing to be around 20, her black hair is plaited back into a braid which disappears into the bowels of her armor. Small strands of hair threaten to escape the tightly made braid and to find their way into her face. Her dark blue eyes appear to miss nothing as they move methodically over her surroundings and when she's speaking to someone they look intently into the recipient's eyes

### **ArcanaFang** (2011-07-09 23:19:13)

I'd say you can own a droid, but make sure that you (in character) are willing to part with it as based on mission requirements.
Go for it, you twisted SOB, but make sure that you don't rely on it for every part of the campaign...because I promise it won't ALWAYS be there for you....ahahahahaha! lol

### **Frost** (2011-07-10 20:28:19)

Are droids allowed as characters?

---

### **ArcanaFang** (2011-07-13 14:02:48)

Frost, Droids can be allowed, but take a -3 penalty on ability points to spend. Reason being is for their seemingly "retired" and "outdated" feel in the Rebellion Era, and if your a droid, I expect you to have a seemingly big advantage with the credits going toward your character in a sense. So yes, Droid character are fine, but take - 3 on ability points.

---

### **Magical2099** (2011-07-13 14:33:38)

alright, i'm almost done statting out one of mine, all thats left is gear. I'm gonna build two, cause I like to give options and I'm not sure of the mood of the game. One will be a trouble maker and comic relief kinda guy, the other one will be hell on wheels and much more serious. Soon as I polish the background and gear up the one I'll get him posted, then start on the second one.

So you know droits usually get 4 less ability points to spend to begin with (since they lack a con score) does that mean Frost will start with 29 points?

### **ArcanaFang** (2011-07-13 22:58:16)

No, I meant the 3 would come from his beginning level. I had forgot about the constitution score they lacked...my bad. lol So let me rephrase my statement.
Droid characters will get 4 less ability points to start with at first level so they will have 32. Sorry for the confusion.

Background
X0 was brought online at the start of the Clone wars. Czerka corporation had been slowly moving out of the droid market to focus on weapons. Czerka sold them as a large bundle to the Republic for use in their new military. He and eight other astromech droids were assigned to Fighter Wing X-Ray Kilo Squad. As the war progressed Kilo squad became a tighter and more focused unit. He started emulating the clones behavior and even downloaded the Mandolorian language to better understand his friends. He began to feel a kinship with the clones, them basically being biological droids for the most part. He felt protective of them and made sure they always came home in one piece. X0 noticed the longer he went with out memory wipes the better his performance became. He ran the calculations and determined the best way to ensure his crew's survival was to not be wiped. Since saving lives took precedent to routine maintenance he started hacking into the maintenance records and forging his wipes. As the war progressed and his analysis of Republic tactics started showing significant flaws he became disgruntled with how the GAR was treating the clone troopers. In one of the final battles of the Clone wars his ship took a direct hit to the canopy killing what remained of kilo squad instantly. Something inside X0 snapped he rerouted the systems and took full control of the ship. He killed five enemy fighters that day but ran out of fuel before he could return to the Acclamator ship he was stationed on. So he floated in the wreckage left behind because there were no life signs on board. He floated out there in stand-by mode for several years before he was picked up by a rebel scavenger unit trying to arm the fledgling rebellion against the Empire. Now he is back on line and back in service just where the little droid wants to be.

I don´t know if this is your first droid or not Frost, but I found quite a few errors, though not all droid-related.

* You should have 3 DP.
* You should know one more language, and since you don´t have a Vocabulator, you should probably add "understand only" a a note on Basic and all other non-Binary languages.
* I think Fortitude should be 15. 10 + 1 (class) + 5 (level) - 1 (str).
* Assuming you started in Scout, I count HP to 51.
* Melee should be +2, and Grapple should be +2.
**Feats*** Droid´s can´t have the Shake if Off feat, since they have no Con score.
* If you have reprogrammed your starting feats (which it looks like), you´d need to buy the appropriate feat packages, unless someone else reprogrammed you. But from your background it looks like you did it yourself.
* You can´t take Starship Tactics at level 5, as you don´t gain a feat at that level.
* Scouts don´t have Imp damage Threshold as a bonus feat. No class do
* You should pay double the listed prices for all droid equipment, as Small droids have a cost modifier of x2.

That´s what I could find.

I actually don´t know about the HP, but since you were using it for Fortitude, I´d say it should go for HP as well. But I don´t know if RAW ever says anything about it, so it might just be houserules.
I´m annoyingly surprised that you were correct about the cost modifier, and may have found my new big dislike in the droid rules. Because it costs just as much to make an advanced processor for a Medium droid as for a Small one...right...

Why should it cost more? And advanced processor is an advanced processor weather it's going into a small droid or a large droid.
It's like the starship rules. The navicomputer and weapon systems have a base cost no matter if it's going into a snubfighter or a battle cruiser. Just because the ship, or droid, is bigger doesn't necessarily mean the part or componet costs more.

Why should it cost more? And advanced processor is an advanced processor weather it's going into a small droid or a large droid.
It's like the starship rules. The navicomputer and weapon systems have a base cost no matter if it's going into a snubfighter or a battle cruiser. Just because the ship, or droid, is bigger doesn't necessarily mean the part or componet costs more.

Well, it´s just that the book especially mentions miniaturization as one reason for the cost modifier of small droids, and processors are one of the hardest things to miniaturize. But here it doesn´t matter if you want to place it in a humanoid-sized droid, or something the size of a coin. For some systems, sure, but I still don´t like it.

Well, thanks for that clarification everyone. It truly seems that the RAW might be a little broken as Darth pointed out. Nevertheless, I like the idea behind your character Frost, it seems it will prove an interesting role given you play it right and I gamemaster decent as well.
So that leaves us waiting on Magical, and you Anthrax, right?
And guys, I do appreciate your overlooking of each others character sheets. I value both your wisdom and experience in the art and crafting of said sheets. I might even need your help on some on my villans, although I'll try my damndest to not go THAT far lol.
(P.S. Thanks for my shout-out in the bulletin sent to the emails. I really appreciate that!!!)

Background, Description, Personality, and Character synopsis
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jikk-Jikk was born the son of a prominent Jawa chieftain on Tatooine. He had a fierce rivalry with his seven brothers for their father’s attention, as his favorite would become the next chieftain. After an unfortunate accident involving several power-packs that were intended to melt his oldest brother’s Ion rifle almost killed said brother, Jikk-Jikk was banished for five years from his clan. During this five years, Jikk-Jikk traveled the galaxy’s seediest locales, finding work as a saboteur, mechanic, and demolitionist (and thief, scoundrel, slicer, and general scalawag). He made quite the name for himself, becoming known in several black-market circles. His natural propensity for technology kept him tinkering, and he found it much simpler to manufacture explosives on his own, rather than pay market value for them. Thanks to his contacts and patrons, he had ample opportunity to study and dismantle all manner of explosive devices, as well as most common blasters and other small arms. With his impressive skills he felt certain to be in his father’s good graces shortly after returning home.
Once his five years was up, Jikk-Jikk rushed home to find his eldest brother firmly ensconced as heir. A few select hijinx (some involving several brothers’ wives, others rich clansmen being swindled out of large sums of credits) his father bribed a local Imperial constable into arresting Jikk-Jikk, believing his son had learned the wrong things from his banishment. The constable, thoroughly amused at the situation, accepted the hefty bribe and promptly had Jikk-Jikk arrested on trumped up charges. Jikk-Jikk’s father didn’t have to pay extra for the multiple beatings and rough treatment; in fact, he had no idea how badly his son would be treated while in Imperial care.
Jikk-Jikk was never officially released (though he had never been officially arrested either) and only found his freedom during a Rebel attack on the local prison. During the chaos Jikk-Jikk scavenged the material to build his biggest ‘BOOM’ yet: spare detonite, powerpacks, detpacks, jetpack fuel tanks, and three swoops. The mobile disaster laid waste to a large portion of the prison, and the Rebels organizing the raid took pity on the small being, and quickly found him *almost* worth their effort.
Standing one meter tall and weighing a whopping twenty-two kilos, Jikk-Jikk only stands out when he chooses to. His robes are standard Jawa fair, with dozens of pockets for trinkets and gizmos. His outer cloak can be flipped around to show its true purpose as camouflage, and his hood stays up almost all the time. He wears a broad utility belt, and from it hangs a handmade double barrel blaster carbine of his own design. A satchel containing a sensor pack hangs from his shoulder. Unlike most Jawas, his time amongst society has made him accustomed to other beings’ sensitive nostrils. He no longer soaks his robes in the putrid soup of his people, and since he rarely communicates with his own kind anymore it doesn’t hurt his ability to talk to his own kind.
Jikk-Jikk is unpredictable at best and downright chaotic at worst. Unlike the rest of his species he understands property (his property, and that property that will be his), but has no qualms falling into the typical Jawa out of pretending not to understand the concept. He also displays the worst Jawa trait: vindictiveness. He will not hesitate to run from a conflict, only to sneak back later and rig the aggressor’s refresher to blow. He is also something of a party animal, and overly curious about females of other species. With his practiced fast-talk and ability to make credits seemingly appear from thin air (he thinks counterfeiting is okay too), he doesn’t have much trouble satisfying that curiosity either.
Jikk-Jikk is light hearted and comedic relief in a lotta ways. In a deep, dreary game he won’t do a lot of good, he’d probably go a little crazy. If the good guys are clearly good guys (heroes) he’ll be perfect for this game.

### **Magical2099** (2011-07-28 08:52:24)

all of the droid business went out the window with the costs and me finding the personal translator. I was about to buy a training remote from CW and install a vocabulator and just have it follow me everywhere. Also wanted to give him a skiff to go with his roving junkyard to act as a base for the group too, but credit limits killed that as well. they weren't necessary (or practical) more flavor than anything else, so i don't miss em. Jikk-Jikk would be a blast (pun intended) to play.
two more a'comin', one a little darker, more serious, and as explody, and one that can fit any style of game.
edit, again: and please, folks check my math. y'all know how i am with this stuff.

* Nar Shaddaa background
Fourth Dex, Int
Background, Description, Personality, and Synopsis
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Background: The boy ran for his life. He’d been through two sewage ducts, skipped from speeder to speeder to cross skylanes, and tried every trick he’d learned in his twelve long years on Nar Shaddaa. Unfortunately, they were gaining. *I’ll never listen to that Rodian again,* he thought as he panted down the alley in Correllian section. *As a matter of fact, I’ll kill that barv next time I see him. Easy marks my arse.* He continued his head long rush, coming quickly to a dead end.
He turned to face his pursuers, truly beginning to feel fear. The human man and woman entered the alleyway, spotting him easily.
**”Quick little barv, isn’t he?’** the female asks her companion.
**”Aye. Can we kill him and be done already? We’re behind schedule,”** the male replies. At these words the boy bolts, trying to juke past the pair only to find the palm of the woman’s hand across his face, landing him roughly on the ground.
**”I’ll have that cred-stick back now, eh?”** she says casually in spite of the recent burst of violence. Frustrated and in pain, the boy stands and flings the cred-stick at the woman’s head and tries again to bolt, this time to catch the back of her armored gauntlet and wind up back on the ground. **”Angry little cuss, isn’t he? Some fight in him,”** she says as she kneels beside the dazed boy, wiping a small amount of blood from his forehead, smearing the accumulated dirt there.
**”Sure. Kill him. We’ve got work to do,”** is all the reply she gets from her companion who stares off towards the end of the alley with a bored look on his face.
**”Look here! There’s a wee boy under all the grime and filth. Can you believe it?” she asks.
**”Sure it’s not just a pale Jawa?”** is the male’s response, which is answered by a stream of vile curses from the boy in Huttese.
**”Oh, I like him. Cyar'ika, can we keep him?”** she asks wistfully.
**”Sure, so long as we get the job done we’ll take two or three home with us. Your name is Nehutyc Evaar now. Get up, and here,”** the man says, passing the boy a hold out blaster.
The boy, more than a little shocked at the discussion he thinks he heard right, goes along with the couple and soon finds himself living better than he ever had before. Adopted by Ka’ra and Ciryc and a part of the Hoagra clan, he master many different weapons and the Resol'nare. Putting his new skills together with his old he became an accomplished assassin and demolitionist.
At the ripe age of seventeen he began serving as a mercenary for the Empire or whoever paid. He was approached by the new Empire to eliminate a gathering of “terrorists” on a small world on the edge of the Core. He found no terrorists, instead he found a group organizing a peaceful protest, but swallowed the bile rising in his throat and did his job. He waited for the Empire to arrive and confirm his job accomplished and pay the other half of his fee. When they arrived they brought troops instead of credits, and Nehu found himself under arrest. They confiscated his ship, weapons and armor, and swiftly sentenced him to a stint in the spice mines of Kessel. While there he made several new acquaintances, Imperial dissenters and naysayers, some arrested, some framed like he was. When their allies bribed enough officials to see them free they took Nehu with them. He promptly cleaned out his accounts and made one last trip to Mandalore to resupply.
**”You’re a damned fool, you know that? That’s a war can’t be won, son,”** Ciryc told his son.
**”Yes buir,”** Nehu replied, **”But they stiffed me out of half a million credits. Besides, there’s little to no work to be had.”**
**”You may not be worth a damn at picking your battles but at least you have one to fight. Your buir and I are horrible farmers. Here, I’ve got something for you. Took it off one of those dar'manda clones,”** his father said, laying a case on the table between them. On opening it, Nehu found a clone commandos ICWS in near perfect condition.
**”Heh! My new friends will appreciate the irony buir, thanks. Give my yaim to Sisser, eh? Wait till she marries that smart one though,”** he says as he pulls on his new helmet. *Not beskar, but it’ll do in a pinch, and this finish is great,* he thinks with a grin as he activates the active camouflage on his armor and hefts the rifle. **”Tell buir I said goodbye, and take care of yourselves. Keep an eye on the news, you’ll be seeing my handiwork shortly,”** he tells his father, the cocky grin plain in his voice. The tough old barv at the table just waves, understanding the need for short goodbyes. Nehu gathered the rest of his new gear and made his way to the spaceport, eager to get on with his first assignment.
Description: At 1.8 meters tall and 90 kilos, Nehu barely qualifies for average human size. His hair is blonde and his eyes green, and his torso and limbs all bare a variety of scars all located around the seams in his armor. Ropy, wiry muscle covers his lean frame, and he moves with the ease of a well trained soldier or athlete. His armor blends with his surroundings, and a bandoleer of grenades and ammo hangs across his chest. He wears a jetpack with a set of quick-release clips mounted on either side, making his rifle or the missile launcher he carries readily available. Around his hips hangs a utility belt, from which hangs a holstered pistol and sheathed vibrosword. When not in his armor he usually wears cargo-pants and a tank-top, sometimes with a short-waisted jacket in cooler climes. At minimum he has his belt, pistol and beskad with him, even when not in armor. On those occasions where he simply must go unarmed he will tuck a vibroknuckler into a boot-top or other hiding place.
Personality: Nehu is aggressive and not terribly wise, often leading to bad decisions becoming disasters. With strong leadership he can accomplish great things. He fights the Empire for personal reasons, when pressed to give an unbiased opinion of the government he actually thinks they’re okay, other than being contract breaking, defaulting ranat excrement. Nehu isn’t a good or nice person, having lived his early years on the streets of Nar Shaddaa, and then doing several years in the mines of Kessel. Being raised by Mandalorians is his only saving grace, giving him and understanding of duty and honor at the very least. Were it not for his parents and commanders, Nehu would have become a very dark soul quickly.
Synopsis: I was mostly done with this guy when I took the time to look over Alicia’s character in detail, but here he is anyway. This guy wears a gray hat and likes it. He didn’t join the Rebellion for altruistic reasons, but for a grudge. He’s perfect for a darker, more serious game, and has a lot of RP potential. Who knows, maybe some of the Rebels could make a hero out of this feisty young troublemaker.**

**Background** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The Bothan Spynet stretches far and wide across the Galaxy, its eyes and ears are everywhere, tapping into the flows of information everywhere. Two such sensory organs were the parents of Arask Ker'ley, and they had the dreadful assignment of being part of the intelligence cell operating on Nar Shadaa. The Smuggler´s Moon is known to be a place of corruption, hosting every type of business bordering the legal, and pretty much everyone that has flat out crossed the border as well. And naturally, such a place becomes an invaluable source of information. Though it may not be the best place to raise a child in.
Arask was raised as much by himself as by his parents, not due to lack of love or care, but because they saw the need for him to grow strong if he was to survive the harsh reality of his life on the most morally decayed planet in the Galaxy. And, they knew he would need to develop creativity and resourcefullness if he were to one day join them in their line of work. As he proved a fast learner, it didn´t take long before he began to assist his parents in their assignments. Minor things only at first, but as his age increased, so did the responsibility they placed on him. Around the age of 14 however, a botched operation made it necessary for him and his family to relocte from Nar Shadaa.
At the same time, their superiors decided it was time to call in Arask for some proper training, as they had deemed him fit to join the Bothan Commandos, the more militant branch of the Spynet. He was instructed in advanced techniques of stealth combat and sabotage, as well as espionage and subterfuge. After some years of training, he was among the youngest to join the commandos, at the age of 16. He served all across the Galaxy, but eventually became the Spynet´s source of communication with the militia led by Rahm Kota, one of the Jedi Generals to survive Order 66 and the rise of the Empire. He served with Kota´s militia for a while, though eventually took his leave as he was reassigned.
At the moment, he is assigned to watch and assist the fledgling Rebellion, a power the Spynet would much rather see winning the rising civil war than the Empire. He is to act in secrecy however, and only expose the extent of his involvement and resources to those he can absolutely trust, as well as continually feed whatever information he can back to his superiors.

</details>

**Apperance** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Not looking the part of the sturdy commando, Arask shows a rather frail-looking and wiry frame, though this appearance can be quite deceptive. While perhaps not the best physical specimen, he is tough and durable, having been trained to endure almost anything and come out alive. Otherwise he looks quite like the typical Bothan, with tan fur across most of his body, though he hasn´t quite developed the beard-like strands found on elder members of his species.
He usually wears simple clothing in unremarkable colors, with his hair loose and hanging, giving him a somewhat ragtag appearance. Anyone getting that idea might think twice once they spot the bandolier running along his chest, or the holster on his hip, containing what appears to be a sawed-off military-grade rifle.

should have 3 Destiny, its one every odd level, and BaB should be 3, not 4 (unless Fang decides to adopt Alicia's house rule about multiclass BaB in which case my Jawa's is wrong) and grapple should be 7.
why should Frost's grapple be 2? It should be 7, its the high of Dex or Str.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-08-07 11:47:58)

hmm, might need to change the BaB then, but I´ll await conformation on that.
Frost´s Grapple mod is +2 since Small characters have a -5 penalty.

whats the grapple penalty for not having arms?
