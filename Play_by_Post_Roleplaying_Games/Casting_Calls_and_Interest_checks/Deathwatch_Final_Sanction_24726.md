# Deathwatch: Final Sanction

### **Tempeste** (2010-06-25 15:17:06)

Deathwatch is a yet to be released RPG being published by Fantasy Flight Games based in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The player characters are members of the Deathwatch, the militant arm of the 'Ordo Xenos' which itself is a branch of the Imperial Inquisition, dedicated to protecting the Imperium from Xenos or Alien threats. The Deathwatch is formed of the best that each Space Marine chapter has to offer, each being a genetically altered superhuman capable of surving wounds that couild kill a normal man many times over and known to the greater galaxy as the Angels of Death.
Final Sanction is an adventure released by FFG as part of Free RPG day and can be downloaded from their website. I'm interested in running this on the Chatroom, sometime after next week. The adventure comes with all of the rules you need to know and has premade characters for you. If you're interested then please post here, Times/dates for the Sessions will be arranged at a later date. If you want to know anything about the setting or game then I'll probably be in Chat.
A link to the adventure is below, although obviously don't go reading through the GM section unless you don't plan on playing.

Have you started this yet, because I would like to try it, but I don't own the rules.

Sorry man, this never got started, and Temp hasnÂ´t been on since several months.
