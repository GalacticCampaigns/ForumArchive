# Dungeons and Dragons Interest check

### **master_Tru** (2013-08-15 10:22:05)

Hello,
I recently purchased the pathfinder d20 dungeons and dragons core rule book, and so far I am impressed with it. I am taking a break from star wars rpg for a little while and I was thinking of going back to basics, aka DnD. Like most DnD for me was the foundation the initial start into RPG.
So here it is on this mainly star wars rpg, I am wondering if any of you have an interest into a dungeons and dragons campaign?

I'd play in a Pathfinder campaign. I really don't have interest in going back to DnD though...
