# Gotham Genesis Still Recruiting

### **simplyscribed** (2010-10-31 23:46:08)

Just in case there's anyone who might be interested in this game but didn't check out my post in Interest Checks, Gotham Genesis is a unique retelling of the origins of Batman and other iconic heroes and villains of the DC Universe, taking elements from comics past and present along with the ideas of my players and myself to create a new Gotham at once familiar and entirely our own. For season 1 players will take on the roles of their characters while young adults who have yet to adopt their second identity and gradually develop the character into the hero (or villain) we already know they're destined to be! This is a great chance to put yourself in the shoes of a favourite character and, while remaining true to the spirit of that character, find ways to make them your own.
Here's a link to the original Interest Check, which has all the information necessary: <!-- l -->[viewtopic.php?f=159&amp;t=24818](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=159&t=24818 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=159&t=24818")<!-- l -->
You may also want to check out the Rules Reference currently posted in Gotham Genesis along with the character discussion also posted there.
I still have room to fit one or two more people into the season 1 cast. If you're interested, let me know.
