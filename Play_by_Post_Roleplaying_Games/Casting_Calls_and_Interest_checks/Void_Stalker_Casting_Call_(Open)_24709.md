Background
A Zeltron raised on Alderaan, Tanai had a simple and peaceful upbringing. Of course that wasn't enough to satisfy her need to excitement and the pursuit of new experiences. After spending some time working on a light transport, she signed up with the Exploration Corp. She enjoyed that for a time before growing bored with the solitude. She has since heard about the growing anti-alien sentiment of the Empire and many of they're other policies, that just don't sound like fun at all.

**Appearance**
Covered in a dark faded environmental suit it's impossible to make out any distinguishing features of the Ubese. His face itself is covered by a tinted black plate that allows Kitsune to see out but prevents anyone from seeing in. He's of average height for a Ubese though others may have difficulty even recognising that at his race, an educated guess is the best anyone could make.
Kitsune was a Thief, Murderor and Assassin for hire who's been on the wrong side of an Imperial Prison Cell too many times. The last prison he found himself in was the famed Kessel, supposedly impossible to escape from. For once in his life he did actually need help however, a fellow inmate by the name of 'Ilu' formulated a convoluted and confusing plan to stow away on one of the freighters that docked frequently, ferrying supplies to and from Kessel. The plan actually worked, partly due to skill but mostly due to blind luck. Ilu revealed the reason for her imprisonment once they'd made it to a smugglers station in the outer rim, a Rebel operative. Kitsune ended up joining her in the fight to bring down the empire and restore the galactic republic.

**Electronic Sabatotage:** You excel at causing havoc with computers and electronics. As a standard action, you can lock down a computer terminal by making a Use Computer check, making it potentially difficult for anyone else to access. That computer is considered unfriendly to anyone other than you who attempts to use it, and the result of your Use Computer check replaces the computer's Will Defense on an attempt to change its attitude.

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Born into the Tapani House Pelagia, Katriana's father, Lord Thomas of the House, was killed during the Mecetti Purge. She was 6 years old when Imperial soldiers raided her home and they violently took her father and little brother away. They left Katriana, her mother and her one year old sister, Helena for dead. Fortunately her family retained it's wealth and with the help of an old family friend they were safely transported to another world. Marie, met a noble of House Reena and they were soon married. Residing within the House as a cover the survivors of her family prospered. It was through her stepfather, Lord Galen Shaffield, she was able to gain her vast medical and technological knowledge and training.
Though her teen years were influenced dramatically by the culture and whims of the other Tapani nobles she never forget about the atrocities inflicted by the Empire and House Mecetti when she was younger. Using her resources and knowledge to her advantage she has searched for clues as to what has happened to her father and brother. Using her connections she discovered the movement Mon Mothma and Bail Organa were secretly influencing. Having not had any success in her own search she offered her own services in the hopes of preventing other families from undergoing the same atrocities in the future.

**Description**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Standing proudly at 5'6" this human woman, who appears to be in her late twenties, is dressed in a long sleeved, tasteful garment of Tapani silk. She wears her long, light red hair in an up-do. During her travels she wears more appropriate garments, though on closer examination it is not to hard to imagine she is a noblewoman. A blaster pistol can be seen on her person during her travels and a medical kit isn't too far from hand.

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Marina, Nadia's mother, had escaped to Telos a few months after Order 66 had been initiated to rendeavous with her master Silas Draay. When he failed to appear she tried to hire herself as a mechanic in the hopes of leaving the planet before she was discovered. It was while she was working on a cargo transport that she met Storn. The crew had been taking shore leave when he came to capture his mark, another member of the crew. Unaware as to what the man had done she tried to defend her crewmate and ended up revealing herself as a Jedi. That day Storn captured his mark and Marina. He wasn't able to hold Marina for long as she managed to escape. Impressed by her ingenuity, Storn offered her a place on his ship. Having no where else to go, she agreed rather reluctantly.
Several months later, Marina and Storn were married; the Mandalorian way. Marina wanting to help the growing rebellion was able to convince Storn to become a mercenary with her, though they usually ended up working for almost nothing. It was during her time working with the rebellion she was reunited with an old friend of hers, Erdan Sarkin, and was through them he met his wife, Celena. Two years later, Marina learned she was pregnant and wanting to reunite her family sent for Nadia who was being raised on an agrarian backwater planet on the Outer Rim called Iruji. Storn readily accepted Nadia as his own daughter as blood didn't matter to the Mandalorians. Settling on the Imperial occupied Madalore, Marina hoped to hide her family in plain site from the Empire. Starting a farm on the outskirts of Enceri with her good friend Erdan and his wife, they taught their children the Mandalorian ways. Marina attempted to teach her children about the Jedi hoping one of them would show an affinity to her old way of life. However, Nadia was Marina's only child to show any affinity to the Force and no matter how Marina tried, Nadia just wouldn't accept her teachings. This fact put a strain on Nadia's relationship with her mother, especially when Nadia eloped with her husband when she was fifteen. Though within the year they had settled their difference. Marina had resumed her work for the Rebellion and would often take Nadia with her on missions. Cander, Nadia's husband, disapproved of the missions, wishing Nadia would work with him instead of going off on fool's errands which would likely get her killed.
The year Nadia turned sixteen she also gave birth to her son. It was a few days after that Marina left on her last mission. When Nadia learned of her mother's death she was enraged and it was only Erdan and Storn's consolations which kept her from running off for revenge against the Empire. Instead she and Storn left to reclaim what they could, returning only when they had her remains to burn. Nadia claimed Marina's lightsaber as her own and spent the next year raising her son.
On a visit to the capital city of Keldabe, the Mandalore Fenn Shysa called ralied for an attack . Caught up in the middle of it, Nadia was unable to get her son out of the main conflict, which resulted in her one year old son's death. Nadia and her husband divorced as easily as they had married and parted ways soon after Krad's death. Nadia subsequently left Mandalore, tortured by the memories of the loved ones she had lost, and for the last few years has hired herself as a mercenary and taking bounties. Hiring herself out like a mercenary she's completed a variety of jobs or has found positions on ships as a mechanic or pilot.
**Family**
Storn Skirata - Father; retired bounty hunter. Usually went after rapists and murderers. Now he spends his time helping to rebel against the Imperial occupation.
Ka'ra Skirata - 19, adopted sister. Farmer. Leading a simple life on the planet, she runs the family household and raises her son, Kaden. Her husband, Krad, is usually away working on missions with Ven.
Kaden - 2 boy; Ka'ra and Krad's son
Ven Skirata - 14, brother. Mercenary. Like Marina he's been hiring his services out to the Rebellion, now the New Republic.
Rora, 12 girl adopted; She is the one who helps Ka'ra maintain the house, and enjoys hunting.
Vau - 16 boy adopted; pilot/mechanic
Cander Bralor - ex-husband; Mercenary. Married when Nadia was 15. They separated a couple years later soon after their son died in an accident.
Korbin - Cander and Nadia's son who died at one year of age during a conflict in Keldabe[/list:u:37cau1py]

### **Frost** (2010-06-21 13:38:54)

Tapani nobles are an insular lot, but during the Imperial period, members of
House Pelagia try to rebuild their fortunes and reputation by engaging in
business outside the sector. They are watched by the Empire and harassed
by agents of House Melantha, both of whom fear that Jedi might still be
hiding in the rubble of Pelagia. Nobles of House Pelagia might hire a party
of heroes to assist with various tasks, or perhaps one of the characters is a
member of the House.
Are you a member of this house Alicia?

### **Alicia** (2010-06-21 14:35:29)

As indicated by my backround, her mother married into Reena. Though if it would suite your purposes better it's easily changed.

### **Frost** (2010-07-01 16:10:42)

We have a lot of shooters/pilots/mechanics we have 1 medical style character and a couple of FS. The only requirements I ask is that you character have pilot as a trained skill and have loyalty to the Rebellion and its ideals. Pretty much anything is open except for actual force training of any sort. If your interested in force training I can work it into part of the campaign development.

---

### **Frost** (2010-08-10 15:06:50)

So the latest batch of rebels have washed out so I have openings again. I need some more dedicated players who can post often so they can keep up with the awesome core group. I only ask for 3 post a week but more is ok and encouraged.

I think the simplest thing to do is to post up a quick summary of your characetrs history, and one who has the book can suggest some appropriate backgrounds for you.

### **Anonymous** (2011-01-06 07:20:35)

I was planning on playing a Quarren Male, enslaved by the Empire and liberated by the Rebels. This experience turned him into a fierce opponent of slavery, even going out of his way to stop slavery and free slaves. Before his enslavement he was a regular Quarren, living in the deep seas of Dac. Maybe a member of a Quarren Ranger force or Deep Sea explorer. Raised by parents with a bit of a dislike for the Mon Calamari, his views of them are neutral at best.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-01-06 10:43:04)

Right of the bat, I´d say you are a perfect fit for the Enslaved background. IIRC, it gives you a bonus to grapple checks, something about not letting anyone catch you again. Perhaps not the greatest bonus, depending on build.
Other than that, a professional background like Military or Labor would probably suit you. Profesional backgrounds gives you one extra class skill, as well as a +2 bonus on untrained checks with a few other skills. I´m away from my books until late tomorrow, but someone else can surely fill in the details.
