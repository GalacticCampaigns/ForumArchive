# [SAGA Leg - ORPG] Alderaan's Wake

### **Dreamwalker** (2011-12-08 16:00:58)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Darth Krayt&#39;s Empire has firmly established itself throughout the galaxy. The Jedi are but a myth during this new dark age and most have retreated to the lavish greenery of Ossus in refuge. However, a group of individuals possess a destiny that even they do not know about. There are some in the imperial aristocracy who would like to keep this secret of their potential until the time is right; and that time its nearing its culmination. This secret has been locked away in the deepest recesses of Imperial mainframes for a time possibly since the formation of the first Galactic Empire. It is nothing but a simple collection of data files. Not even the most adept slicer from Corellia&#39;s finest CorSec police forces could get to these files. One particular file is of great importance. The file code named 3-WA has much in store for these select few, but are they going to be able to shoulder their unimaginable destinies? And though it may seem a blessing, the PC&#39;s could very be well shouldering the most burdensome of destinies that could tear their souls to its roots. Can you handle the duties and wear the uniform under a tyrannical Empire? Can you shoulder such heavy responsibility? A responsibility that brings with it the entire weight of the galaxy?</span>
This campaign will be focused on the inner workings of politics and the dynamics of bureaucratic brutality within Darth Krayt's Empire. My game will be for a thinking man's roleplayer and is not for the feint of heart. If you are not savvy with words and cannot survive in a combat situation, you will perish either by death or dismissal.
I focus on having my PC's undergo criticial decision making as refined officers; with the occassional threats of battle to keep you on your toes. And some of you will really get to understand the meaning, "The pen is mightier than the sword."
There is great opportunity for aspiring Imperial Officer PC's within my campaign; File 3-WA could be the singularly most defining moment of the galaxy. Furthermore, it's a war on three fronts. You must deal with the Galactic Alliance and Roal Fel's Galactic Empire. Despite all these problems you must rise to the occasion in the spirit of true noble blood. The question is, can YOU shoulder your preordained destiny in a galaxy thrust into war and define its existence?
Some basic game play mechanics....
You are all Imperial Officers in Darth Krayt's Empire. You must have at least one level in the officer prestige class...no exceptions. If you want to have some ground pounder abilities that is perfectly fine. If you want to be chief of security or a high profile bodyguard that works too. But that type of character will be very limited in ability at a Moff High Council.
Your basic alignment will be floating around somewhere between Dark Side, neutral, or just a follower of the Imperial viewpoint. A GOOD character is permitted, but you will have to be VERY diplomatically savvy to play this character...and a good character background must be approved by me before you are allowed to play them.
I want to start every one around levels 8-10. We will be using the Organizational Score Chart from Galaxy at War for promotion purposes, as it will keep the players on their toes and seeking that next shiny new rank they can pin on their collars.
I'm seeking about 4-6 to players...there are a lot I already have in mind. But if you show enough interest I can work to get you into a slot. If you don't know already, I am a very dedicated GM and my storylines have evoked a lot of "shock and awe" moments, though I have had my bad days. One thing I do promise is to give you nothing short of my best and be the GM you can ALWAYS depend on.
A big aspect of this campaign will also be I want nearly every player to have a legacy. If you want to have Mara Jade's legacy...go ahead. Does Palpatine tickle your fancy? Guess what, you can be heir to one of the greatest tyrants of all time. Heck, I'll even let you have the most Lucas' most prized legacy, the Skywalker bloodline. The campaign still needs some work, but I do work on it everyday. So please post here if you are interested <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> .
