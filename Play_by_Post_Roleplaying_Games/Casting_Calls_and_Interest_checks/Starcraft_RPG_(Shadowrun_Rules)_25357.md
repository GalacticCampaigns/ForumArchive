# Starcraft RPG (Shadowrun Rules)

### **Saronian** (2013-05-20 15:03:03)

Hey all. I'm currently working on a Starcraft RPG using the Shadowrun rules. This is designed to be easier for people to come and go in the various games, as well as make the power curve that can hinder a "level" based system when it comes to the enemies and such. This also means that I'll roughly be following the campaign set in Starcraft (both 1 and 2).
I'm thinking that initial starting buildpoints will either be 350 or 400, but with a focus on more "civillian" ability (no one is going to be in marine armor just yet). This is also due to the fact that Confederate Forces have started to use more of the resocialized convicts in their forces and such.
Any one interested?

This sounds pretty interesting. I think I would like to give it a go.

COuple questions:
Which version of Shadowrun?
Since I don't have any Shadowrun books or Starcraft Books, would that be a problem?

4th Edition Shadowrun (unlike 4th Ed D&D, SR4 improved alot on mechanics and other stuff) will be used, as well as checking out 5th Edition Shadowrun when it comes out (greater differences in skills nd their rating and such).
The core rulebook for SR4 (either the 4th Ed or 20th anniversary will do) is needed, since it gives tips and rules on character creation. As for Starcraft, just looking at the wiki can help, though it is not necessary.
Basic concept: It is very much a low/non-magic system with varying degrees of technology levels (no resonance/no magic scores). Initial campaign has the group on a Confederate colony that has been colonized in the last 20 years or so, so it's recommended that you have a reason to go to a new colony world.
Colony is located on a arid world that has a decent mineral wealth but little in else (it's more like the Dakotas in terrain, though I don't really know much about those states).
Any questions, comments, or concerns?

Ah, I was thinking of just having it in the basic discussion. But it's understandable.
As for an actual game, I have one being setup on the Giantitp Forum.

It´s been a while since I looked into Shadowrun or played SC, but I´ve been playing SCII rather recently, and I do love the setting, so you can definitely count me as interested.
I guess I can live with starting out as a "regular" guy, as long as you promise I´ll eventually be able to get into the mobile hell that is a firebats armor (or something equally bad*ss, but IMO nothing beats those guys) <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

i would use magic rating to represent psionic protoss and some zerg abilites. The same thing for ghosts i would think, phsical adept style.
