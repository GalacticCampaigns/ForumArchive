# Is this interesting?

### **Maldoravia** (2012-05-27 12:10:07)

I am currently formulating a campaign to GM for the very first time, so if anyone has critique they would like to throw in please feel free.
The campaign story is in progress but I do believe it will take place during the Rise of the Empire. Rather than have an -actual- set story and have checkpoints within the campaign...I was thinking about making this one totally free range. No GM feeding the player's towards one direction. The big stipulation of course will be that the group (however big) must stay together otherwise the entire campaign runs amok. I will be accepting one Force sensitive..chosen by the best well worded three paragraph PM explaining why they believe they should be the one chosen. If all entries are good I might allow all of the players to be force sensitive....provided the reasons given are realistic of course. I have not worked out how many slots there will be yet, as I said this is still in early development. The interactions, the battles, the entire world in this campaign will be shaped by the characters...as I have no actual goal set in mind. I will let the players make their own goals. Heads up though. It will have a large number of battles as well as speech checks, I find these to be the most fun as well as just actual RP....which you will have all the time in the world for. What I am working on now is the rest of the setting. I have the era, I just need the places and ships worked out....was thinking Coruscant to start with then move from there. There will be at least -one- ancient relic that can ultimately change the entire fate of the Empire before it even gets off the ground, or help turn the tide in their favor and have the Empire come early. The more I think about this the more I think the group will start out as -part- of the rising Empire, unless an extreme number want it to be the Republic...I can work either way. Unfortunately this is all I have so far...
As a side note, only to show how serious I take campaigns, I want people to read this one very carefully. THIS CAMPAIGN WILL HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR DRAMA. If IC is taken oocly or vise versa, there will be repercussions. THIS IS A GAME AND DOES NOT AFFECT YOUR REAL LIFE. Therefore, you should not treat it as such. If your character doesnt like something that happened...there is always IC revenge. If you rage quit, do not expect to be let back in. The moment you say "I quit", you will be gone and replaced immediately. I have no time for nonsense. If it is found that anyone has been harassing another player, you will be booted. If it is found you have been harassing anyone from a different campaign, I will kick you from the group and your items divided among them. If you harass me, same will happen. I just want my first campaign to run smoothly people, I do not like to sound like an ass. I feel the need to get this out in the open though because recently I have found how emotionally draining these things can be when people do most of the things I mentioned above. Happy Memorial Day weekend.

I can´t say for sure if I´m interested yet, but it´s always interesting with new games, but I´d like to see some more info before I know for sure. But good initiative, though I have a few concerns:
Why limit the party to 1 Force Sensitive? Instinctively it sounds like you want to single out one person to be more "special" than the rest of the group, based on some arbitrary judgment by you. If this leads to a game centered around that character, that´s fine if that´s the game you want to run (though I would definitely lose interest), but I would advise that you make this *very* clear to all players before hand. I have been in games where this has occurred, and it kind of sucks to realize partway through the game that it doesn´t really matter what you do, because you are ultimately just a minor role in the tale about character X.
I´m also a bit curious as to why you would choose to run a "sandbox" type of game as your first GM effort. My recommendation would definitely be to try something more structured, just because it is easier. Though if I understand things correctly, you seem to have some kind of story in mind, so maybe there will be some kind of storyline that the players would become involved in, though they could do so in many different ways and for many different reasons depending on the characters and their goals? Am I getting close here? I´m just trying to get a hold of what the "sandbox/railroading ratio" will be.
Finally, I think you should include some general info about what you had in mind gameplay-wise, like if you will run PbP or ORPG, high/low level and so on, as these things can help people decide if they are interested or not.

Honestly I'm not seeing much here that interests. Maybe once you put together more information on the setting you want to run in, what sort of characters would thrive there then I'll take another look.
Right now there's just not much to go on.
I agree with DA on most counts especially concerning the FS. I generally don't like such stipulations put in a game to begin with. If a player wants to play a FS during a time when there's danger than that's all part of the challenge of being able to react and cope during such setting. As the GM you're well within your rights to send force hunters after the party and target the 'abusive' force player. Background is also key so if the player doesn't have a reasonable explanation to have surviving as long as they have then they should be sent back to the drawing board.
If this is your first game to GM I would highly recommend not doing a sandbox type game unless you plan to run as pbp. Doing sandbox in a live game is very difficult and most new GMs end up feeling very daunted. If you do this as a pbp then as a GM you have time to react and plan according to what your players want.
In all having some sort of background story is essential otherwise you'll have players wanting to go every which way with no common goal to keep them together. What's nice is while they have the goal they can still come up with whatever crazy plans they want to react to it and still throw you through the sandbox loop.

Also I want to add as far as characters go. If they all want to play FS then maybe as a GM you should take it as a sign that this is the sort of game your potential players want and work with it rather against it. After all you said you wanted to play a sandbox game which puts significant power toward your players as far as what they want to play and to their play style for the game in which they will enjoy.

If it turns out that most people want to play a FS character then I will see about removing that stipulation. I was just concerned about gaining the attention of people who are "lightsaber happy" to coin a phrase.
I had said this was -very- early in development. I still have at least two months before I would even be comfortable recruiting for the campaign.
The campaign will definitely be PBP. My line of work usually dictates what time I can be on the internet (hardly except for Saturdays and Sundays) so a PBP would work better overall if the GM has time constraints like I do. It wont hinder the story.
I was thinking about starting the levels at around...say 5 or 8.
A sandbox type rp seems a good note for me to start on DA, not sure why but thats just the route I want to take. I like those types of things.

I like the idea of a free roaming game, very MMO kinda. But guys? you both have played in games where there are Jedi or Sith who want nothing more than to run around with the lightsaber and force powers, who act nothing like Jedi or Sith. I've played in those games, and I really hate those people.
Plus I know a few GM's that put that restriction in their games, 1 FS and that's it, it weeds out the others. you guys really shouldn't assume that he's not going to do something that entails a chase after the FS, or something. Just saying, you guys kinda bashed on the idea of a sandbox, though DA asked a lot of good questions to get a better idea. I would love it if there's a set goal and multiple ways to get there that are all up to the players, I think that would be so much fun!
I look forward to more coming out on this!

Don't get me wrong. I've always enjoyed the idea of a sandbox game and I'm eager to see what you develop.
I hope you'll keep us informed of your progress, Mal.

Sorry if it sounded bashful, my only real objection to a sandbox game is that I suspect it is much harder to run than a more story-driven game, especially for a first-time GM. But if you feel that´s your game, go for it. I suspect it will be easier if you get good players, and we´ve got plenty of those here. I generally prefer games that are somewhere in-between, with a decently set story to follow, but where it changes in many ways depending on what the players do, and where the players can go about doing things in many different ways.
I´m not assuming that the game will center around the Force Sensitive character, but that is the instinctive feeling I get when someone says that they´ll only allow one character with that ability in the game. And if a GM wants to run that kind of game then it is fine, I only strongly recommend that it is pointed out from the very beginning, so that no one is surprised by suddenly realizing that they´re just a sidekick to those the story is really about. One thing to remember is that Force Sensitive =/= Jedi, so by having such a restriction in place you limit peoples abilities to play other types of Force users. And by choosing the setting you have, I´d say you have already gotten some limits in place for people who are too "lightsaber happy"...limits which should be enforced to the max <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
I´m not sure on how much of an idea you´ve got on this yet, but since you said you were in an early stage, I thought I might offer a "sandbox"-style suggestion, though this one does favor the Rebel side of things. If characters are willing, they could work to establish a new rebel cell somewhere in the Galaxy, with all what that entails. For story, you have the fact that there will be some basic things they will need to set up a cell (finding a good hideout, someone to supply them, etc), plus you have all the "bigger" things going on in the Galaxy at the same time. At the same time, there exists a lot of freedom in how they go about being a pain in the ass to the Empire: Will they take more militant action, like Kota´s Militia? Or will they work diplomatically to create support among diplomats and the general populace for the rebellion? They could be doing work as spies and intel agents, or perhaps work actively as gunrunners or smugglers, maybe with the assistance of local criminal gangs. Or they could just be doing a mix of all these things as opportunities arises.
Not sure if you were looking for suggestions, but that was just some quick thoughts of mine on how a sandbox game could be built up <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> Anyway, keep us posted on the development, and ask away if you need any help or input. I have no doubt you´ll be able to find enough players to get going once you are done.

Hi. My name is BW. I have run exactly one game on the site, my first ever with SAGA, during the ROTE, and it was largely open-ended/sandbox style. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->
Actually what happened, as anyone here can tell you, was I started recruiting for the game with a real loose idea in mind for an overall plot and then started the players out in solo threads. It was wicked fun for me because it meant rolling with whatever punches the players threw at me in terms of what they wanted to do and that only gets better the more you work it out with the players. Eventually they all met up or were about to meet up but the situation was horribly contrived, and because running a game with a party as opposed to just one player is quite different, and because I didn't really stick to my guns about when I was going to stop the game (I set a time limit of a couple months and just sort of planned on stopping, regrouping, learning from my GM experience, and then picking up or trying something different altogether), it sort of fell apart. It may seem like more of a train wreck in my head than it really was because it was *my* train wreck, but that's the way it goes I guess. I still had a great time and I think the players mostly did too - but I would totally suggest a definitive end to the adventure. Maybe don't worry too much about the details and be open to suggestions/requests as far as character builds and adventure features, but be really clear about when it's over. "**We'll play until Darth Bertha is killed.**" That way you can all see when it happens and then, if everyone wants to, keep going (Bertha survived...! ) or whatever.
The *Force Unleashed* book has some really interesting thoughts on having Jedi during this time period (I believe it's my favorite, personally) and I think restricting Force Sensitives may not be as important as having players committed to their characters and really taking the time to flesh them out together and make specific efforts to include them in the game. During this timeframe specifically it's interesting because they can't be really open about Force Sensitivity anyway, which sort of has it's own built-in check/balance. I had a Jedi technician that wanted to build her own droid (which she did, and she met a Jedi Knight and Obi-wan, and is headed to a secret planet of her own making), a shockboxing human replica droid with multiple personalities... or something... and a way with the ladies (he got to shockbox a Togorian that ended up struck by lightning and a giant junk droid for Jabba's viewing pleasure, and pick up another replica droid girlfriend), and a droid assassin that could see through walls (ended up with his own, all-droid, ship and a contract for someone currently in Kessel). I didn't have *any* of that planned out until they started throwing character ideas at me and we worked through it. We all have our own GMing styles for sure, but this is definitely something I enjoyed and would do again - I would just be really clear about the ending, whether it's an in-game goal or real-time time limit or whatever. If they all want to be Force-users then don't be afraid to use a little early discovery of the ysalmari (or however it's spelled) or use a lot of droid/beastie bad guys (can't be mind-tricked and such).
Anyway, that's my two-and-a-half cents. Can't wait to see what you come up with! Happy Memorial Day!
~~BW

Freeform but keep the party together?
Sounds like you'd be better with something on rails, the rails of which are shaped by the players either by pulling rank or a more diplomatic solution. As others have suggested, unless there is a common goal I don't see how in an MMO style game why certain characters would stick with others. I think DA's suggestion is a good one. Common Goal and Rank structure will keep the party together and allow them to pursue different avenues to get to their goal.
What sort of post rate were you looking for to keep the story moving? Once/day? Once/week?
DA also raised a valid point that if you're FS it doesn't mean you're going to be running 'round shooting lightning from your finger tips and slashing at everything with an LS. There are much more subtle ways to use force sensitivity: bet fixing, enhanced piloting reflexes, that-general-forboding-feeling. A better limitation imo would be 1 Jedi/Sith in the party. Someone that follows the doctrine of either side. I don't see why you couldn't have party members that are FS, but they just haven't had any training to hone their skills yet. Or secretly and/or randomly select individuals within the party to impart force sensitivity onto?
If we're talking of MMOs the original SWG (pre the 'combat upgrades'), you had to accomplish nearly everything in the game before you awoke FSity...and even then it was a double edged sword: Death was permanent and there were a hell of a lot of Bounty Hunters tracking you down. If you attracted too much attention and didn't have a good party to back you up when the BH came knocking, you would be killed.

I would be interested in playing this kind of game. I have played, and enjoyed a few like this before.
