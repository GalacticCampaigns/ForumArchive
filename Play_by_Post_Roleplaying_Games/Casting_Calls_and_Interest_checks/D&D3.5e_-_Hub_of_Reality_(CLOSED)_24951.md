# D&D3.5e - Hub of Reality (CLOSED)

### **Anonymous** (2010-12-26 23:22:34)

I'm doing a 3.5 homebrew world called Grey Sky. The campaign is called hub of reality because it's connected to many different planes via the sea, and through rifts that open from time to time.
Character rules:
Stats are 4d6, rerolling ones, and adding up the highest three.
No evil characters.
Core races and classes, as well as anything from the Eberron books, Savage Species, certain monstrous humanoids from the Monster Manual. If you want a monstrous humanoid, or a non-core race or class, send me detailed info, or a link to the book it's in.
Characters start at third level, with max hp.
One magic item, approved by me. If you want a certain affect, but can't find an item with it, I can see about making one.
I try not to kill characters. This doesn't mean it can't happen. If your character dies, have a backup ready, or be prepared to get sent to the back of the queue.
A character's favored class is "any," meaning that their highest class counts as their favored class to reduce exp penalties for multiclassing. Prestige Classes don't count (since you can't take them until you're around level ten or so,) but you can only have one.
Posting rules:
I expect you to post at least once every other day to keep the game moving. After a week of no activity with no good reason, your character will be dropped in a town, and you'll be put at the back of the list to get in.
Please check your spelling and grammar.
Be somewhat articulate with your posting. Two lines minimum, more is appreciated.
I do humor-based games. If you can't accept humor, or don't like my particular brand of humor, either tell me so nicely, or don't say anything about it. Flames will get your character killed and take you off the list of players for ANY of my games.
If you have disputes over the rules of the game, make a short OOC post, and then send me a PM, so that we don't drag the game down arguing over it.
If you're doing a skill check, put the necessary rolls in the post. The same goes for attacking. Make your attack roll and your damage roll in the same post.
Leave OOC chat OOC.

Just so people know, I´m working on a char for this, just taking some time. unknownmercury, I hope you don´t mind, but I made the rolls for stats with my own dice on my floor, as the built-in dice ode seems to be broken. I got really good stats, so I´m hoping you won´t take them away from me, and I can swear on anything that I made it totally legit.
I´ll be picking a few things up from some supplements I find interesting, but I´ll be sure to name them so you can look them up for yourself.

No problem. I'm usually pretty lax about stat rolling.
EDIT: I'll be closing this thread and requesting the forum on February 1st.
