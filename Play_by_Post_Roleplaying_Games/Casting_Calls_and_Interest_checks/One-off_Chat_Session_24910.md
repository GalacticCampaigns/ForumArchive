# One-off Chat Session?

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-21 12:14:36)

Hello all! I'm interested in running a one-off adventure in chat, but I recognise it might be hard or even impossible to find a good time for this to happen, particularly since most of you are in a very different timezone to myself. So would like to work out if it's feasible before I start writing anything.
Please post to let me know if you'd be interested in this, and include the times you are usually available. Do me a favour and convert these times to what they would be in the GMT+0 timezone before posting. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Also, the genre I'm currently considering is "fantasypunk" - think almost any RPG by Square Enix, Eberron, etc. High magic meets semi sci-fi technology. If you would be interested but prefer alternative genres, please include a list of settings you might be willing to play in.

What Zerah said, xept for me a Vampire wouldn't go amiss...but I will take what I can get if that is not in the curriculum.
