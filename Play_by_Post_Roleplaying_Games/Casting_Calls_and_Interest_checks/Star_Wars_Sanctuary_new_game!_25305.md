# Star Wars Sanctuary new game!

### **master_Tru** (2013-01-27 12:33:47)

Calling all Jedi. The New Jedi Council wants you!
Hey guys, I am starting up a new Star Wars Campaign set in the Legacy Era (that is over 100 years after Yavin) This will be an all jedi campaign, though I may accept one non- jedi applicant back story permitting. Below are the requirements for application to this game, keep in mind I am looking for two to three players which sometimes means not everyone will be chosen:
- 35 point buy
- max credits at 1st level
- starting at 1st level
- Max 1st level HP
-all jedi (except as noted above)
- Legacy Era
-feats/skills/races etc ... not from the SWR core rule book must be noted with the source.
-2 to 3 players, I am bringing forward 2 players from a previous game which after almost 3 years has ended (total 4 - 5 players)
- every starts at 1st level though all players will be jedi young-lings, almost padawans.
One thing to keep in mind that by making a singularish class game diversity will become even more important. With class limitations like this diversity will allow the team to play off each others strengths and weaknesses. Another important note though the players will only start at 1st level young-lings (which means much training within the jedi temples) back story will be an important factor in deciding potential players.
I look forward to chatting with you all on your ideas for this game should you be interested. If you have any questions please ask here <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I think I would be interested in this game. I will start trying to figure out a character.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-01-28 08:40:42)

I would be interested in this too, but just to clarify, when you say "all-Jedi", do you mean that we must start in the Jedi class?
Also, will you be using Backgrounds or Destinies for this game? I know a lot of people don´t like the background mechanics, but if you are looking to try something new, it would be very useful in a game where we are limited to the Jedi class for starters. For example, there will be many skills not available to us with only a single class. Of course, if that is your intention, then that´s fine by me.
Finally, I had a quesion regarding the canon timeline and the time we will be playing in. I´m no expert on the Legacy era, so please correct me if I´ve gotten something wrong. Will we be playing before or after Darth Krayt takes control? Because you said we would be doing a lot of training the Jedi Temple, which sounds as if it might happen before, but as I understand it the Jedi did actually rally to some sort of hidden temple after the third Jedi Purge. Asking since it could have some impact on a background story whether a character has survived the Purge or not.

Yes Destinies will be available for use, so long as it fits the characters back story and at least somewhat influences the characters play style.

Thanks for the speedy responses, but this one leaves me about as uncertain as before =P

### **SonOfSadow** (2013-01-28 15:02:26)

I'm (a little) new to the system and would love to get in on this! An all Jedi party? Count me in.
I'll get to work on a concept. I do have a question though - will lightsaber talents and skills be based on the classical forms, or the ones specifically from the Legacy era? How skilled are our younglings/padawans? Do we want toddlers and preteens like the ones Anakin slaughtered? Or teenage padawans with a little time spent training?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-01-28 15:56:30)

While I´m not Tru, I´d guess that he would have mentioned if he was expecting us to play characters where our age would have a mechanical effect on our characters, so I´m guessing that we would be playing "Adult" characters - which varies somewhat between species, but starts at 16 for humans.

---

### **SonOfSadow** (2013-01-28 18:02:08)

I'm a bit disappointed - I was really wanting to play a diminutive species (Kushiban, or even Yoda's Species) as a Force Mage/Diplomat, though there are not Saga stats for either. Comes off to some a bit cheesy, sure...but would be fun to roleplay!

---

### **master_Tru** (2013-01-29 08:30:18)

You are more then welcome to submit a diminutive species jedi (not the Yoda race though, thus far Lucas has refused to disclose info on that race). You can even submit a child if you so chose to, though as the child leveled at shuch a young age he or she would be considered a prodigy.
Actually people can submit multiple applications to ensure a larger diversity of characters to chose from for the game.

Short answer yes, other answer ... GM`s have a way of answering questions like that :P

### **SonOfSadow** (2013-01-29 10:35:23)

LOL. Now I'm confused Backgrounds OR Destinies? Or both?
Also, will you be banning Skill Focus: Use the Force at Level 1?

Backgrounds are just the story line you write about your character, they are very important as they form the beginings on how that character should be played.
No I will not be banning skill focus at 1st level.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-01-29 10:53:15)

Okay, maybe I should have been clearer on this, but I´m asking specifically about the **Backgrounds** mechanic from the *Rebellion Era Campaign Guide*. That I will give any character I make a backstory I take as a given (usually becomes a shorter novel, but hey...I like to write).
The reason I ask though is that the Backgrounds system is kind of not recommended in the book to use with the Destiny system, and thus I ask which one you are using. Typically if a GM don´t say anything I assume Destiny, but in this case I thought it could be a nice idea to bring the Backgrounds mechanics to you attention, since it can allow us to have a great diversity of skills available to out party even if we all use the Jedi class. We don´t get any additional skills though, but we would get to add 1-2 skills to our class skill lists.
Sorry if I was confusing =P

<strong>BACKGROUND </strong>
Though a native of Coruscant, the raven-haired Arta Soth remembers nothing of her former life, having been discovered by the New Jedi Order as a young child. She has been raised as a student of the Force almost exclusively on Ossus, where the Jedi Academy stands.
Athletic and enthusiastic, Arta prefers the more somatic aspects of the Jedi Arts, using the Force to augment her natural attributes and exceptional combat skills. Though talented and passionate about her studies, Arta sometimes overestimates her capabilities (a trait once attached to the famed Jedi Grandmaster, Luke Skywalker). She is headstrong and inquisitive, and it usually takes the intervention of a respected Master to stay her chosen course. Despite her shortcomings (and a veritable wanderlust), Arta is respected and generally well liked by other Jedi, many whom favor her propensity to make decisions and take action.

<div style="text-align: center;">
**Verin Hyoki
Selkath
Jedi 1**
</div>

**Appearance:** He stands at 1.5 m and weighs 56.6 kg. He has dark green skin with light green mixed in, to complete his underwater camouflage, and black eyes.
**Personality:** He always seems cool and level headed and he seems to be somewhat of a recluse, that is until he gets to know them and opens up some.
**Background:** At the age of 5 the floating city that he lived in on Manaan was attacked by a band of pirates. During the attack his parents were killed and he was captured and taken away from his home world. He spent 8 years as a captive on board an interceptor-class frigate named Sykosis. During his time as a captive they used him as a cleaner and worker, depending on the slave masters mood. He thought that his entire life would be spent as a slave and he would die without ever actually seeing anything the galaxy had to offer. While he was captive he learned how to speak, read and write basic, though he preferred speaking to the other Selkath captives in his native tongue, Selkath. One day the Sykosis was flying in the Hapes Cluster and attempted to lose a patrol in the Transitory mists. Unfortunately for the Sykosis there bold, yet stupid, move landed them in front of another patrol near the planet Terephon. It was a short fight but the Sykosis was captured by the Hapan Royal Navy. Verin hid while fighting took place on the ship and when the battle was over he was taken into custody. Once it was determined that he was a slave, and not a pirate, they were going to let him go. He decided to stay on Terephon and got a job as a shop keeper. Over time he realized that he could sense things that were not there and sometimes he could influence a patron to make a purchase that they might have been teetering on. A few days after he turned 17 a Jedi, named James Crowburn, came into his shop searching for some supplies. Verin attempted to "persuade" James to buy a few extra items, but failed. After James felt that he was able to use the force he asked him how he would like to learn to hone his skills and become more attuned with the force. Verin took his offer and followed him to Shedu Maad where he began his training as a Jedi. He has only been training for a short time, but he can do far more than he had previously imagined while sitting behind the counter of his old shop. He still carries around a training aid, that had helped him with clearing his mind, that James had given him when he first arrived at the academy. Even though his time on Terephon and at the Academy have been great in comparison to his years on the Sykosis he still prefers to get to know people before he opens up to them.

NOTES
*[Lightsaber Form] Power, Jedi Academy Training Manual
Though a native of Coruscant, the vivacious Arta Soth remembers nothing of her former life, having been discovered by the New Jedi Order as a young child. She has been raised as a student of the Force almost exclusively on Ossus, where the Jedi Academy stands. There, she began training with the Jedi Consulars, though she proved to be too impatient and gravitated more towards physical activity. Athletic and enthusiastic, Arta prefers the more somatic aspects of the Jedi Arts, using the Force to augment her natural attributes and dynamic combat skills. Agile and formidable with the lightsaber, Arta has access to more aggressive techniques that have proven to be somewhat unstable for her age and personality. She has been disciplined for failing to maintain serenity in the course of her training, having fallen prey to her negative emotions . This, of course, is subject to scrutiny by other members of the Order, who suggest that her strong sentiments may have been a result of instruction that was too harsh or strict. Arta has never spoken of the matter, and though not necessarily seen as a trouble maker, it is presumed that the Order keep a keen eye on Arta's development.
As she has aged into early-adulthood, Arta has taken a more vested interest in Galactic politics, stirred by her lessons on Jedi history. Some suspect that she is more interested in making a stand against some spectacular foe than she is in keeping order, though it is true that the two have often gone hand in hand. What can be said for certain is that, were the Order ever imperiled, Arta would be among the first to defend them. Her vigor is often refreshing to the older Jedi, grisled or demure veterans of the most recent conflicts - some of whom walked with Grandmaster Skywalker himself. Perhaps they see their former selves in Arta? Or perhaps they are simply relieved to not be the ones to carry such a burden as eagerness?
Times have changed, and the Jedi Order has adjusted, more tolerant of Arta's intensity and youth than they would have been a thousand years ago. Talented and passionate, Arta overestimates her capabilities. She is headstrong and inquisitive, and it usually takes the intervention of a respected Master to stay her chosen course. Despite her shortcomings (and a veritable wanderlust), Arta is respected and generally well liked by other Jedi, many of whom favor her propensity for making decisions and taking action.

As a quick clarification: Do you have a specific(ish) year in mind Tru?
I'm still toying with the idea of submitting a couple ideas but I don't know much about the Legacy Era and there's a lot covered in the source book (you say before Krayt but what's the status of the YV for instance?).

---

### **master_Tru** (2013-01-31 11:01:03)

The YV are mistrusted and even hated living in isolation in various regions across the galaxy.

Son of Shadow it looks like your character has to many force powers for only one force training feat and a wisdom of 14. Double the amount actually.

Well, if you have any questions about the system, you can always ask them right here, and someone will answer you. Make a thread with your questions and you should have answers within a day or so. Otherwise the Wizards of the Coast boards contains a lot of info (I lurk there relavtively often) and helpful people, including compilations of official erratas and FAQs.

Multiclassing will be allowed after level 1, though I do like it when players work that into the story.

That´s already accounted for, just wanted to make sure the plan would hold.

As all Miraluka have a natural connection to the Force, no one usually looks twice when a child with such a gift is born, unless the child shows to be either uncommonly weak or strong with the Force. With Valen, it was the latter. As described by his mother, the child had been literally radiating with the power of th Force from the moment she gave birth to him, and she knew from that moment that it would be his destiny to be away from her, to serve the Galaxy as one of its fabled Jedi guardians. But she would not let him go, not yet, and he would remain with his family until such a time she felt that he as ready to leave.
And so, for the first eight years of his life, he would be raised by his parents, who would teach him how to use the Force, and how to separate the darkness from the light. In particular his father, who had studied the ancient Miraluka tradition of Luka Sene, emphasized that he learn this distinction to heart. It would not be until later in his life that he would learn the reason for this though. And come his eight birthday, his parents told him that it was time to leave. A little surprised and confused, he did follow his parents as they brought him to Ossus.
As he was reluctant at first to join the Jedi Order and leave his family, his parents would finally reveal to him the visions they had had when he was born. It was his destijny to become a Jedi Knight, they said, just as it had been the destiny of his ancestors. When he first opened his eyes, his father had seen a fleeting image of a tall human with brown hair towering over the child and his mother as a ghost. Dressed in Jedi robes and with a lightsaber hanging at his side, the male had locked eyes with Valens father, and in a vision he had been taken back to a distant time and was allowed to witness a duel between the man and a younger human. As lightsabes clashed, the elder male seemed to gain the advantage, and eventually his opponent fell to his knees, and was struck down. The last segments of the vision showed him how the brown-haired human cried out in pain, and then it was gone, along with the ghost.
Doing some research into the mysterious pictures of the vision, Valens father had deduced that what he had been shown had been nothing less than a vision from the Battle of Ossus which had iccured nearly four millenia ago, and that the Jedi spirit who had shown him the scenes had been none other than the ghost of Ulic Qel-Droma himself, the fallen Jedi who had been the apprentice of the Sith Lord Exar Kun, but had redeemed himself by betraying Kun to the Republic. Determined to understand the connection between this ancient character and his family, he searched for any clues he could find about Qel-Droma, and eventually he was stunned to learn that there was a very real possibility that the two families were connected by blood. While it had been mixed and thinned over the centuries, even by the rare mix of Human and Miraluka, and while he could not pinpoint exactly whether it was through him or his wife, he grew more and more certain that his son was indeed a blood heir to Ulic Qel-Droma. And, it seemed, the elder Jedi had returned from the netherworld of the Force with a purpose for his son.
Certain that he should not – and could not – stand in the way of destiny, he took the tale of Ulic Qel-Dromas rise and fall to heart, and was determined to raise his boy to be better prepared to face the dangers of the Dark Side, beleiving this to be the reason why the ghost had appeared to him. And now, finally, had come the tale for Valen to take his first steps towards fulfiling that destiny. Reluctantly accepting his parents wishes, Valen agreed to stay at the Jedi Academy. Before leaving, his father told him that there was a place on Ossus that he should visit when he was ready. When asked what place it was, Valen was only told that the Force would guide him there in time.
Valen soon grew over his reluctance to join the Jedi, and found himself enjoying the training and the company of the other younglings. Inspired by the last words his parents had told him, he worked hard to excel at any task set before him, aspiring to become a great Jedi. Growing a bit beyond his years, he indulged himself in all aspects of the Jedi ways, even applying interest to study other traiditons of the Force, particularly the Miraluka tradition of Luka Sene.
Four years after he joined the Academy, on the day he turned twelve, he woke up in the middle of the night with a strange sensation that something was calling him. Sneaking out of his chambers, set of into the Ossus night, moving quickly through the terrain. He travelled for at least a few hours, gudied only by a strange feeling, and evenually came upon what appeared to be ancient near the foot of one of the many mountains in the area. As he entered the ruins, he felt the strange sesation growing stronger, and suddenly he watched a thin, luminous being materialise in front of him.
While he already felt certain of its identity, the spirit introduced itself as Ulic Qel-Droma, and told Valen that it had been waiting to bring him to this place. When he asked, Ulic told him that they were standing in the ruins of an old spaceport, and that it had been the place where Ulic had faced and slain his brother Cay, his mind corrupted by darkness. He said that he had brough Valen there to make him realize the danger that awaited down the dark path, but also to teach him an important lesson. While Ulic realized that his mind had been influenced and corrupted by ancient Sith spirits and Exar Kun, it had always remained his own. And thus, the decision to kill his brother had also been his own. The importance of this lesson, he said, was that one can never blame ones actions on anything or anyone.
Acknowledging the wisdom behind the words, Valen was still curious as to why the spirit had called him. Ulic told him that the time had come to end his life as a youngling, and that he had reached the proper age to become a padawan. The future had a purpsoe for the young Miraluka, possibly of greater importance than they could imagine, and Ulic intended to make sure he was ready for it. While he understod that it would be informal, and that technically he would still be a learner, Valen accepted this offer, and from that day on, he vowed to double his already considerable efforts to become worthy of his legacy.
Four long years have now passed since that fateful encounter, and it has surprised many that Valen has not been taken as a padawan yet, given his apparent skills. Valen himself, however, isn´t overly concerned, and in fact enjoys training with the other younglings in the temple. On occasion, he has helped as an assistant instructor in classes for the youngest, and he realizes the training such tasks give him. He does, however, long a bit for the time when he will be allowed to leave Ossus and travel the Galaxy to maintain the order.

<details><summary>&quot;Appearance&quot;</summary>

Valen has the build of a well-trained human male, rather tall despite his age of 16 years. Like all Miraluka, he lacks natural eyes and covers his eye sockets with a piece of red cloth, tied up in the neck. Along with his short, dark hair, this gives his appearance a certain contrast against the colors of typical Jedi robes. This, as well as his personal preference and taste causes him to dress in simple and practical clothes - a pair of plain and sturdy gray pants, military-style boots, a red short-sleeved vest, and a rugged heavy cloak for when the weather is harsh

</details>

<details><summary>&quot;Personality&quot;</summary>

Valen is an outgoing and cheerful person, and even though he can appear older than his age, he usually gets along well with people and easily makes friends. Despite his natural talent with the Force, he aim to conquer arrogance and constantly seeks to improve himself rather than getting comfortable, a trait that has led to him exploring a vast amount of various areas of skill.

</details>

<details><summary>&quot;Legacy&quot;</summary>

At this point, Valen has fully embraced his legacy as the heir of Ulic Qel-Droma, and is determined to be ready when whatever destiny awaits him is finally revealed. Since their encounter on Ossus, Qel-Dromas spirit has not manifested itself to him again, but rather guides and instructs him through impressions and visions. Wanting to know more about his ancestor, Valen has studied whatever records of the peroid of the Great Sith War that he can find, and he occasionally returns to the spaceport ruins to meditate and train in solitude.
He does not know if his legacy is known among the masters and other jedi at the temple, and he doesn´t imagine it would have mattered much if it was, nor does he mind. He don´t brag about it, and he doesn´t think himself special because of it, he just accepts it as fact.

I am hoping to have this game up and running in the next week or so, that should give everyone time to add their applications. I have enjoyed reading the current applications and look forward to reading more.

Updated my application with an appearance description. I´ll see if I can find some online help in modifying [this](http://images.wikia.com/fireemblem/images/4/4b/Tibarn.png "http://images.wikia.com/fireemblem/images/4/4b/Tibarn.png") picture, which is kind of the image I have in mind.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Odette Balis</span>
Human Female 18
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Background</span>
Odette was born to a high ranking Pelagian Lord, Linus Balis, and was his youngest daughter born to him by his wife, Juliet Faris-Balis. With her older sister Tessa (8 years older) and younger brother Joshua (4 years younger), Odette lived in a world of privilege without a want for anything. Like many Tapani nobility of the House, Odette was able to escape the notice of the Jedi as being Force Sensitive. Being Force Sensitive herself, her mother Juliet was able to sense her daughter’s talents and sought to use her daughter's developing abilities to their family's advantage. As Odette got older, however, it quickly became apparent Juliet didn’t have the necessary skill to teach her headstrong and talented child. Finding suitable tutors became a challenge until an ex-Jedi crossed her mother's path. Believing in a foundation of discipline, her new Jedi trained tutor, Kal Sran, not only focused on Force training but on self defense as well. While he taught her a great deal about Jedi philosophy, he encouraged her to find her own answers. Over their tenure together, Odette learned she had a knack for manipulating other's perceptions particularly when it came to disguises.
On the cusp of her 18th birthday, Odette is surprised to learn her parents are preparing for her wedding. Betrothed to young Lord Davian Paddox from a prominent family in House Pelagia, Odette finds herself outraged. Secretly for over year she had been seeing, Jonah Batolio, son of a Knight in her father's household. Unable to escape from the betrothal, the two plan to runaway and elope. Over the course of the engagement, she begins to scheme with Kal on how to get away. The day the two illicit lovers plan to elope and leave their life in the Tapani sector behind, their meeting never happens. Arriving at their rendezvous, Odette waits for as long as she can before realizing something must have happened. Making a hard decision, she trusts that he will meet her at their agreed upon destination. Using her natural abilities she makes it appear she's vanished, leaving behind nearly everything but a small horde of credits she had been secretly skimming from her parents meant for the wedding. Odette removes herself from her parents' and, subsequently, her betrothed's reach and hopes that Jonah will be in contact her.
Adopting the alias Cera Pell, she goes to Osus where she intends to start her new life as a Jedi initiate.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Description</span>
Odette is slender and just slightly taller than average height. Long strands of curled blond hair threaten to escape the series of braids trapping them as they fall to her mid back. Her top covers only enough to be modest while her flowing pants are more reminiscent of a skirt. Made of fine materials, her clothing hints to the wealth behind the woman who wears them even though they are mostly unadorned.
Strong minded and sometimes described as bullheaded, she holds to her ideals even if they are in the wrong. Perhaps surprisingly she is fiercely loyal to those she calls friends and will go out on a limb to protect her friends and family.
