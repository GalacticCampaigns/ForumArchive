*The air is buzzing in the market of Khedris – the great market that stretches from the fishmongers on the shore to Caravan Square. Halmaro the Red – master of the powerful Merchants’ Guild, second in power in Khedris only to the emperor of Lantara himself – is organizing a caravan! And this is no ordinary caravan; it will carry goods and gifts for the wedding of Halmaro’s daughter Kira to Prince Eiru of Mashanda. The caravan will be huge, even by Khedran standards. It includes 220 camels, 50 horses, 40 head of fattened cattle, and 50 oxen pulling five wagons. The wagons are quite a rarity in a caravan; some of the wedding gifts must be huge! The word is out that Halmaro is looking for herdsmen, scribes, translators, cooks, guides, physicians, laborers, and other hirelings for the caravan. Many of these will come from the various guilds, but there will be plenty of room for freelancers. Of course, guards will be needed too. Caravanning is not without its risks; bandits, highwaymen, and thieves take heir toll on the caravans, as do sandstorms, heat, and floods.* (from Caravan to Ein Arris, Introduction, page 1)
This is a GURPS 3rd-Edition adventure for **three** to **six players** using **100-point** characters. I have a little familiarity with GURPS (I ran a couple adventures years ago) and the .pdfs are just collecting dust. With all the new folks hearing about the site I thought I'd offer to run this adventure with one very critical stipulation: I will only GM for one month&#39;s time. If someone else wants to takeover at that point that's okay, but I'm mostly doing this to serve as an introduction (or re-introduction) to the system. The two-page preview (and full download) is available below as is the link to the free GURPS 3e Lite file. I do own the core book, as well as a few others, but for the purposes of this scenario we'll stick as much as possible to just using the Lite version.<div style="text-align: center;">

I'm up for this. Will try and peruse GURPS when I've got the free time.

No rush - I hear there's an *Eclipse Phase* game starting up... <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
This was/is mostly to get some activity on the site and maybe expand players' system repertoire so I have no timeline of when I want to get started. I'll leave this check up for a while.

Ten days without a squeak is good enough to warrant me closing this interest check... for now. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
**jaybee3** - I'll see if I can get something set up for a solo game like we had talked about.
