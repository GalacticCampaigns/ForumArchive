**Chronicles of the Last Battalion**
The year is 2307 and the peace that humanity has known for the last century has ended. From the depths of space, giant, mechanical beings calling themselves "The Collective" have descended upon the colonies and have obliterated anything in their path. To meet this threat, mankind has teamed with the noble Grun to form the Colonial Defense League (aka C.D.L.) , arming it with large war-machines known as mechas. But humanity is fighting a losing battle. It needs able pilots, mechanics and mecha-jocks that will win this war for it. It needs you! Join the C.D.L. today and take your place alongside heroes such as Colonel Kev Jet of Centuari IV or Sergent Deena Sark of Ridian Prime. Don't hesitate, go to your local recruitment center today and tell them that you believe in humanity's future!
**===========**
Welcome to the Chronicles of the Last Battalion campaign. Using the flexible [Hero System](http://www.herogames.com "http://www.herogames.com"), players take on the roles of members of the C.D.L. in their desperate struggle against The Collective. The tone is more anime in nature, adopting ideas from several anime, as well as science fiction. Characters may be Human, Grun, Spartan (enhanced humans) or Android (not as detailed as Data, but not as rough as C-3PO either); and may be a mecha-jockey, mechanic or pilot. While the campaign is geared towards a military aspect, I may consider other concepts on a case by case basis.
**Suggested Media:** Star Wars, Star Trek, Classic Battlestar Galactica, Robotech, Gundam Seed/Seed Destiny, Macross Frontier, Starship Troopers and Starblazers
At the moment, I have 4 openings, with a few others opening in the future. Please let me know if you have any questions.

I'm interested, but I don't have any of the Hero system books. If you have PDFs of the books you're using or something like that, I'd be glad to try and learn it.

Okay ... gearing this up to run if folks are still in. But, rather than use Hero, I think I'm going to use M&M's Mecha & Manga to get it moving. Everybody cool with that?
I'll be posting a template for each major occupation and the racial templates within the next week. Please post any questions here <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
