# [RoTE] Voidstalker: Revolution

### **Frost** (2011-07-01 02:30:30)

The Rebel Fleet led by Garm bel Iblis has lost it's first major battle against Imperial forces. The fleet was ambushed by a new class of ship that prevents ships from jumping to hyperspace. Moff Tarkin arrived with a fleet of Star Destroyers and smashed the fleet to pieces. With Garm believed to be killed in the battle Mon Mothma has assumed sole leadership of Alliance High Command. Mon Mothma has decreed that the rebels won't gather in force again but rather use insurgent tactics. Rebel cells are being established across the galaxy starting brush fires and harrassing Imperial forces where ever possible. You have been recruited into one of these cells. Voidstalker squadron is a mix of fighter pilot and commandoes led by a Mandolorian Jordan Revv.
2 players needed.
Character creation
Lvl 4 (No Jedi levels)
40pt stat buy
Choice of bonus feat (Vehicle combat or WP Heavy)
must be trained in Pilot
Choose a background from rebellion era sourcebook
Loyalty to the rebellion a must ( I cannot stress this enough if you need to be paid for every mission or are out for personal profit this campaign probably isn't for you.)
Players must be self motivated. This will be a sand box style game with freedom for you to raise hell all over the galaxy. You will occasionally recieve orders from High Command but for the most part your on your own.
Currently we have a melee specialist (Magical2099), a covert operations specialist (Zerah), and a mandolorian (DarthAnthrax)
There is no overtly social character or tech specialist

Background
Toren-Ve started out as a low level clone tech towards the end of the clone wars. His talents and skill brought him to the attention of his superiors and he was attached to a special project. That project was to clone force sensitive individuals. When the Empire replaced the Republic his team was relocated to a secret facility and his commitment to the project was no longer voluntary. He spent several long years trapped in the facility perfecting the techniques to create force sensitive clones. The Emperor was not happy with how long it took the clones to mature and in the end switched from Kaminoan techniques to Spaarti cloning cylinders. Toren-Ve was shipped off to a penal ship and left to rot away. The only reason he wasn't killed is because his knowledge might someday be useful. Luckily the prison ship he was on also held several political prisoners who where useful to the fledgling rebellion. The prison ship was captured and Toren-Ve was free once more. The time in solitary changed him from the docile clone tech to a true rebel. He craves a chance to strike back at the Empire and it seems he may have found a way.

Hmm, let´s see...

* You don´t get any destiny points, since this game uses backgrounds.
* You should know 5 more languages.
* It looks like you should have one more feat, and you get to make your pick between either Vehicular Combat or WP(Heavy) as a bonus feat for this campaign

And just as a few personal recommendations

* While Cybernetic Surgery may be nice and fit your character (haven´t seen your backstory), the feat in itself is of little real value unless Frost starts to chop us up like bacon. A far better choice would be Surgical Expertise, which also opens you up for the Medic PrC in the future.
* If possible, I would try to free up some ability points for Strength. If you are going to be a field medic, you will be expected to carry your own crap around, and in my experience medical gear can be pretty heavy.

DT, I'm not sure your skill totals are correct. I may be missing something, but shouldn't Persuasion be +7? there are others that seem odd too, might wanna go over em one good time to be sure. Otherwise, he looks good. Medical gear can get heavy, but so long as you aren't trying to tote very heavy weaponry and armor you should be okay.

looks good DT. I see you fixed the discrepancies noted by DA and Magical.
Seeing as there has been little interest I will get this going ASAP
