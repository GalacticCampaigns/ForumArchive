# GC MMO-style

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-11 04:26:17)

Well, that last Interest Check didn´t give much, so I´ll try something else.
I´ve been pondering an idea for a while now, and decided to see if anyone was interested. I was planning on trying to run a couple of single player campaigns set in the same time point in the SW galaxy. To put it simple, the only thing these campaigns would really have in common would be the setting, otherwise they would have very little to do with each other. In a way it becomes like kind of an MMO, though two different campaigns wouldn´t necessarily have anything to do with each other. The whole point however is that they could, and at least all things happening in one campaign will also happen in the other, which could have consequences. Of course, if one player wants to be an explorer on the Outer Rim, and one a gangster on Nar Shadaa, chances are their adventures won´t affect each other at all.
Character choices would be pretty free, restricted only by common sense and era appropriateness (see below), but one should consider that some professions just aren´t suited for creating a good, adventuring, atmosphere. Sure, if you really want to be a Twi'lek waitress on Bespin, I can probably try to create some interesting story, but you should think twice on if that is really fun for you in the long run.
I have been thinking about which era to place the campaigns in, and I´ve figured that the involved players should have some say in that, which is why I put up the poll. I feel confident setting a campaign in any era, though I have very little knowledge about the Legacy era, so one could expect a bit more diversion from canon there. I was thinking to set the campaigns with the background of one of the major conflicts in that era (personal preference, conflicts make good backgrounds for pretty much anything), though this could be discussed. I´ve included examples of where the campaigns could be set in the poll options.
Hopefully, someone will catch on to this. I´ll probably settle for 2-3 campaigns from scratch, not to over burden myself, though if someone would volunteer to co-GM, more could be added as well.

This sounds like it could be fun.. I have a few characters I would REALLY love to play again.
I'm guessing though this would be pbp?
I didn't vote on an era because some of the characters could be changed by tweaking their backgrounds, though really I like them the way they are.
Here are some of the characters:
[Adalyn Pallax](https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ATHYulLjxAGXZGNjOXo3MjlfNjFkNjJqcTVmeg&hl=en&authkey=CL2pybMD "https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ATHYulLjxAGXZGNjOXo3MjlfNjFkNjJqcTVmeg&hl=en&authkey=CL2pybMD") (ROTE, pre-clone wars)
[Jace Cloudspinner](https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ATHYulLjxAGXZGNjOXo3MjlfMTcwZDR0bWpyZDQ&hl=en&authkey=COnvx8IN "https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ATHYulLjxAGXZGNjOXo3MjlfMTcwZDR0bWpyZDQ&hl=en&authkey=COnvx8IN") (KOTOR, around the time of the Jedi Civil war - afterwards.) I'm more interested in player her as a low level FS learning to develop her abilities.
[Marina Numa](https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ATHYulLjxAGXZGNjOXo3MjlfNmNqMnc4MmNy&hl=en "https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ATHYulLjxAGXZGNjOXo3MjlfNmNqMnc4MmNy&hl=en") (ROTE, post Order 66) Marina is a Legacy character and would prefer keeping her around the time frame I built her for.
Those are my top three... I might post more later. Let me know what you think. I would like to mention that I don't mind doing a small group RP as well. It doesn't have to me necessarily a solo game. I love interactions between characters.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-11 15:30:16)

Yes, I was thinking PbP. Hopefully though, if there is only one player in each campaign, it could be played at a significantly higher pace than other PbP games.
I would not be opposed to playing with smaller groups, though I kind of thought a solo game could be an interesting choice. Plus, it´s not like you couldn´t interact with the other players as well, depending on what kind of characters you play. Two bounty hunters, or one gangster and one law enforcer for example could have quite a lot of interaction. The main reason I wanted to try solo games though, is since I´ve been having troubles with player activity in previous games, and wanted to make sure I had something running before I widened the player groups.
I wouldn´t really mind either of those characters, as they all seem to be of the type that will get themselves into adventures. I forgot to mention in my initial post that the rules for character creation would be rather open as well. I could adjust starting levels, equipment availability and so on to reflect the kind of character you want to play. My preference would likely be low-level (max 5), but if someone wants to play a bounty hunter of certain skill and rep, or a war veteran of many campaigns, that could work as well.

I asked about small groups because Yogi and I were at one time looking for more RP opportunities for our two Tapestry characters.
I've sent him the idea but as he's been busy not sure Joe much time he has for another game.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-11 15:40:41)

OK, if he has the time, a campaign with two players instead of one isn´t a big deal.

### **Alicia** (2011-02-11 15:48:49)

Waiting to hear from him but till then don't mind a solo...
Let me know which character draws your attention and any campaign details and I'll adjust it accordingly.

Sounds interesting. I've been busy (which has subsided quite a bit) and in a gaming funk...I really need to post.

### **Blackhat** (2011-02-12 03:01:54)

At the very least, it'd be interesting to watch.

### **Parmenter** (2011-02-12 11:27:17)

I've been out of the loop for a spell, and wouldn't mind getting back in. Not too mention, a game devoted entirely to me, sounds like a fantastic idea. I can't believe I didn't think of it. Once an Era is agreed upon, I'll have applications lining up at the door. I voted for the New Republic, but would be open to anything.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-12 18:46:50)

Glad to see there is at least some interest in this. I´ll probably be leaving this thread open for a little while longer, to see if more interest shows up, and perhaps get a more decisive vote on era. Once I feel I have enough, I´ll make my decision on era and specific time in era to play in, and then I´ll make a proper casting call, with more details and so on.

### **Yogi** (2011-02-12 20:20:43)

Yeah after talking with Alicia I'd like to give this a try. We both want to use those characters more and I don't think cliff is ever going to restart his tapestry game up again.

Ditto. Out of all my characters Jakira is one I'd really like to play again.

Huh, looks like the scales are tipping towards a Legacy-era game then. Means I will have to start reading up...

---

### **simplyscribed** (2011-02-13 12:32:43)

Interesting idea DA, and if the timing wasn't inconvenient I would definitely be up for it. I have some characters that could use some lovin' too...
Perhaps once you're up and running, and I get myself back into a groove, this is an idea I could really get in on (if you still have space for me at that point!).
Good luck with this anyway.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-16 04:48:54)

Well, I think this seems to be all the interest I´ll be getting for now, so it seems like we have ourselves a Legacy era game. Like I said, not my strongest era of knowledge, so you might have to excuse some fact errors or so, as I´ll be going pretty much only on the info coming from Wookiepedia and the Legacy Era Campaign Guide. On the other hand, this means I can (and probably will) take more freedom in ignoring canon <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> .
I´ll be writing up a proper casting call once I get back from school later.

Awesome.

### **Yogi** (2011-02-18 12:29:36)

What about special rules? Cliff used a revised set of rules that are/were copied from Alicia's rule modifications. (which were used in the creation of our characters.)
See them here.

I will be putting up a thread for posting guidelines and stuff inside the game forum, as well as one for houserules (of which I really don´t have a lot, and certainly nothing major). Unless stated otherwise, you should assume everything works as written, and if there are any questions, just ask. What I can say from that thread though, is that I uses the fractional BaB rule. I often forget to list this as a house rule, since I tend to see it as "default".
I´m not sure if you were in the chat room when I expressed my mind about that PrC while it was in the making, but to make it short: **NO**. As far as I (and I think canon) is concerned, the Mandalorian Knights died with Demagol, and has never been heard of since. We could have a long discussion both about the concept of Mandalorian Knights and the mechanics of that PrC, but the essence of my opinion is still: **NO**. I´m sorry if this creates conceptual issues for you, and as I said we can talk about it, but certain things you just want to keep as you like them.

Based on what you said above I'm guessing that the combined armored defense and Improved Armor Defense and the combined "block/deflect" talents that were used in making Wes in the other game is not a rule that you use? I'm just trying to figure out what I need to change and what I can leave the same with the stats currently on the character.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-18 16:49:22)

Yes, that is correct, you would have to take each of those talents separately.
