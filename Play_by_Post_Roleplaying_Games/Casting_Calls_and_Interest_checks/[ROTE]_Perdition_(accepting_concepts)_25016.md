It is a time of desperation! The Clone Wars polarize the galaxy, from Coruscant to the Outer Rim. The Separatist movement to create their own government, separate from the Republic, spirals out of control into full galactic scale conflict. Villains rise to prominence, heroes fall in battle, and the galaxy teeters on the edge of total chaos.
The realities of the war are confronted everywhere. Nearly every world has a Republic or Separatist presence, and even remote and out of the way planets are drawn into the conflict. Except for the Unknown Regions, nowhere in the galaxy offers escape from the Clone Wars. Previously peaceful planets are swept up in the increased militarization and worlds that have been free of conflict for centuries are now the site of devastating clashes. No organization is safe from the effects of the war, as corporations, criminal empires, ad mercenary armies struggle to find a way to survive the expanding conflict, and turn a profit at the same time.
The Confederacy, fueled by their idealism and cynicism wrought by the corruption and failure to resolve dilemmas in the Republic, band together under the banner of Count Dooku – a dissatisfied Jedi Master - to forge a new alliance devoted to restoring equality and ending strife on their respective worlds. Thousands of worlds join the Separatist cause.
Meanwhile the defenders of peace and justice in the Old Republic-the Jedi Knights- are stretched beyond their capabilities in their role as leaders. With even newly knighted Jedi being placed the heads of entire armies, the Jedi are simultaneously more prominent in the galaxy and yet on the brink of extinction as one by one the Jedi fall on the field of battle.

Tirahnn, a Mid Rim world on the Perlemian Trade Route. The planet may seem of little importance to the greater scheme of the Clone Wars, but some months ago, the Separatists took control of the planet from the Republic and in the process disrupted the trade route and the Republic's supply lines.

---

This will be set during the Clone Wars. I will keep the exact timing undetermined for now but just be aware the war is in full bloom toward the second or third year of the conflict.
I will be looking for characters to work together as Seperatists and as Loyalists to the Republic with 2 or 3 players in each group (up to 6 players total). You may be Jedi, mercenaries, planetary defenders, soldiers, scouts etc, as long as you align yourselves within one of the factions and have a reason to be participating in the war.
Please submit a concept first using the following: (Once I see concepts and had a chance to speak and tweak things with you then we can get to the character creation.)
Please feel free to apply with as many concepts as you wish, your are not limited to a max/min aside from your own creativity.

Once you're concept is approved you may proceed to the next step. Please see my House Rules and Rules Changes: <!-- l -->[viewtopic.php?f=238&amp;t=25021](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=238&t=25021 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=238&t=25021")<!-- l -->
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Character Creation**</span>

* 32 point buy for stats (does not include racial or ability changes)
* Level 6
* Max HP for level
* **credits** = max starting of first level + ((level -1) x 2,000); If you take wealth please remember that the credits may not be in just the form of equipment or currency. They can be used to purchase RP resources such as contacts, etc. Ships may be allowed under certain circumstances. Discuss this option with the GM before building it in. If you don't have enough for concept based equipment (ie. Mandalorian's armor) please speak to me.
* **Favors** see [Regulations](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=238&t=25021#p57800 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=238&t=25021#p57800") for explanation of how favors will work.
Players will be allowed to stat their favor up to the CL they are purchasing (use same character creation rules but with point buy 28). A background- a summary will suffice- and description with an idea of personality will be required.

 *Players start with an amount equal to their credit amount above for use for favors. Any left over credits can be used for property which can't be quickly liquidated. IE house, stocks, bonds, etc.* Optionally you can use any left over credits from equipment to increase the amount available for favors.
* **Books to use** any, I ask when writing out the stat block you make a list somewhere of where the non-core references are coming from (see below). This includes equipment.
* **Races** Era specific. Make sure to look in the Wookiepedia to see if they were actually around during this time. If I see they aren't then the character will be denied.
* Detailed, well written background and description required.
* We will also be using a combination of the Backgrounds found in the Rebellion Era book and Destiny.

Instead of choosing a Destiny you will instead choose a Background. he Background will work as normal depending on whether Event, Occupation or Origin is chosen. Every odd level you will gain 1 Destiny point instead of 1 every level. Additionally, there are no longer any Destiny bonuses aside from those afforded by talents and other uses of Destiny Points. On occasion, the GM may see fit to award additional DPs for heroic actions or other exceptional actions.
* **Optional**: You may take a Skill Training in place of a Starting Class feat. The skill must be from your class list. Please make a notation of the switch

Use the character sheet post model, keeping the formating. In a separate list (using spoiler) indicate the location of non core material.
For your benefit and mine, please include a level breakdown in a spoiler:
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Level 1: Noble 1;** Str 10, Dex 14, Con 10, Int 13, Wis 15 (-2), Cha 17 (+2) Wealth (5,000)
**Talents** Wealth
**Feats** Linguists, Force Sensitive, WP (pistols, simple)
**Skills** Deception, Gather Information, Knowledge (Galactic Lore, Life Sciences, Social Science), Persuasion, Treat Injury
**Level 2: Noble 2;** Wealth (10,000)
**Feats** Surgical Expertise
```
[size=125][b]Level *: Class *;[/b][/size] Str *, Dex *, Con *, Int *, Wis *, Cha *
[b]Talents[/b]
[b]Feats[/b]
[b]Skills[/b]
[b]Force Powers Known[/b]
```
The point of the breakdown is so you can see at what level you have taken certain abilities. Remove fields when they are not applicable. This will not only avoid errors at character creation, but will prove useful if/when retraining.

</details>

I ask you please use spoilers for large amounts of text (background, personality, etc), leaving a title for the spoiler outside of it. This will allow easier navigation of the cast list thread later on.

## Re: [ROTE] Perdition (OPEN)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-22 06:31:28)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Kieran Tanyon</span>**
Male Human(Echani) in his mid-twenties
**Faction:** Republic(Jedi)
**Brief Background** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Kieran was born on the Inner Rim world of Keshan, homeworld of the Echani. Already at a young age is he introduced to training in self-defense and unarmed combat and as he grows, he displays a natural affinity for battle, often besting sparring partners many years older than him.
As it were to happen, a Jedi Knight passing through the system caught notice of Kieran, recognizing him as being sensitive to the Force, and after his parents had given their blessings the boy was taken from Keshan and brought to the Jedi Temple, where he would study to become a Jedi Knight. After a couple of initial years in training under Grand Master Yoda´s supervision, Kieran would be taken as a padawan learner by the same Jedi Knight that had originally brought him to the Temple. Together with his master, Kieran would travel the Galaxy on various assignments, but it was not until a few years prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars that things got really interesting.
Investigating a rumor that the Sun Guard of Thyrsus, a splinter group of Echani mercenaries, had allied themselves with the apparently revived Sith, Kieran and his master were sent to Thyrsus to investigate this. While they were unable to find any truth to these rumors Kieran, as a native Echani, was invited to stay with the Sun Guard and learn their ways. Given permission by his master (with the inofficial assigment to continue their investigation), he remained on Thyrsus, and was introduced to a new branch of his native culture he´d never known much about.
Where his native Echani raising had taught him to fight hand-to-hand, the Sun Guard would train him in techniques of using bladed weapons, which he found translated quite well into lightsaber combat. His instructors would also insist that he train wearing Sun Guard battle armor, allowing him to build up his strength and endurance in battle, as well as using the plates to deflect his opponents attacks. During his stay, he became more and more indoctrinated into the Sun Guard, and his attention to his assignment as a Jedi dwindled, as did his contact with his master and the rest of the Order.
After about two years spent on Thyrsus, Kieran was surprised when his master suddenly appeared in person. He was even more surprised to hear the grave news his master brought with him: The Galaxy was at war, and Master Windu had called upon all available Jedi to rally on Geonosis to rescue captive Jedi. Though the biggest surprise came when they were about to leave. *See “Past Adventures” for more information on this*
After leaving Thyrsus behind, Kieran made his way back to Coruscant, where he was introduced to the situation at large. After his masters recent demise, Kieran was assigned duties alongside other Jedi and their apprentices, but the military training his upbringing and time on Thyrsus had given him soon gave him charge of his own clone forces, partaking in battles mainly in the Inner and Mid Rims.

</details>

**Past Adventures** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Here I could define what happened as he and his master tried to escape Thyrsus, but I think that´ll be a quite long segment, so I´d like to save that for now. I guess some of his recent assignments in the war could be listed here as well, but they aren´t really anything special, just “regular” military operations.

</details>

**Personality** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

A quite social person, Kieran has trouble neither making friends or inspiring the loyalty of his troops, and he makes it a point to always be on the front with them, assisting them in whatever ways he can. When it comes to particularly dangerous objectives he often throws himself first into the fray, surrounded by an elite squad of his troopers that he has dubbed the Eclipse, in obvious defiance of the treacherous Sun Guard.
He is a formidable warrior, and takes both pride and confidence in his abilities, and often spars hand-to-hand with his troopers to keep them in shape. He is skilled in military tactics as well, often using unorthodox strategies to overcome his opposition. Used to operating quite independently, he is not unknown to disobey direct commands if he feels they present to great risk to his troops, or simply finds them ineffective. A trait that of course makes him popular among the troops, but maybe less so among the upper ranks of command.

</details>

**You Ended Up Here Because …** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Because the Jedi need all available Jedi to lead their forces, as they are stretched beyond belief across the Galaxy. He can´t really understand why such an obvious tactical error is made, but he just does the best he can from his place in the structure to make the Republic victorious.

</details>

Well, here´s my first concept. I´ll be making expansions on his background and past adventures later, but this gives a good idea of who he is at least.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Mursst</span>**
Male Trandoshan Mercenary equivalent of 29 years old
**Faction:** Mercenary under Separatist employ
**Brief Background:** Born on Dosh, Mursst's whole life has been about The Hunt. Upon reaching adulthood, he was taken by his father on a ceremonial hunt, killing a captured wookiee in a near disastrous melee. Mursst lost his left arm in the attack, which regrow a few days later.
**Past Adventures:** Has worked as a mercenary/bounty hunter for the CIS since the beginning of the war, but hasn't really done anything that outstanding. The largest mission involved joining up with a few more of his Trandoshan brethren to ambush a clone platoon on Felucia.
**Personality:** At times sadistic and cruel to his enemies, Mursst however is relatively benign to his allies, temporary as they may be. He has a slight ego, overstating himself at times, and sometimes getting himself into too much for him to handle.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** To put it simply, Mursst was hired to be hire at his usual rate for a few "simple" missions on the planet. During the CIS takeover of the planet, Mursst went behind enemy lines to take out small squads of Republic troops. Now that the battle is over, he is simply waiting for his next payday.
Brief Stats Musings:
Thinking of going Scout 3/Soldier 3 for the start before moving on to the Bounty Hunter prestige class. Maybe with a touch of Elite trooper in the future.

**Brief Background:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Born into servitude to the Nightsisters on Dathomir, Jor spent the best part of his younger years performing manual labour for the settlement and his mistresses. Ploughing, mining and foraging were all second hand to him at a very early age. He knew very little about his parents, his mother died during labour, and his father was ripped to shreds by a frenzied rancor while hunting near the settlement. This was a turning point in his life. A nightwitch looking to exert more influence on her kin within the region, twisted the will of a number of the Nightbrothers in the encampment, leading them deep into the forests. Jor was among them, whether he was egged on by the sense of adventure or was completely under the spell of the witch as her voice echoed through his head, he followed the band of young Zabrak as they ventured deeper into the woods. Days, weeks, maybe months passed as they seemed to walk in circles, the thick vegetation not easing their passage. In fact, nor was the weather, which was becoming increasingly dire - one day the rumble of thunder could be heard overhead, the next would be sweltering heat and the day after a thick fog impairing vision beyond even an arm's length.
As could be imagined, the once sprightly footsteps of the band of brothers began to slow to a shuffle as their odyssey continued, it was then the first death came. Exhaustion had well and truly set in, the life seemed drained from the youngling's face - a once brilliant red, now just a faint hue of rose - as he dropped to the ground. They trod over him as the whispering commanded them to continue. It wasn't soon before the next death, there was a shuffling in the undergrowth then that was it...silence, another one of them gone. Passings along similar lines continued for the next few nights, until it was just Jor left. His head pounded, his arms were too heavy to lift, his legs were covered in blisters and his lips were cracked from dehydration and then the fog slowly started to dissipate, the howling wind began to settle and the torrent of rain let up. In a few minutes, everything had changed, he was now sat in a clearing on a warm summer's day a small hut a few yards in front of him. A slender figure emerged, robed head to foot in black, adorned with precious jewels and tribal symbols, her face was gaunt but the pits of her eyes were a deep purple verging on ebony. There was no mistaking what she was but a Nightsister,
"Congratulations, young one, you've passed my little test." She spoke methodically, "Those that are strong-willed enough to survive what I just put them under should be able to survive any of the other wretched clans' tricks. You're going to be my little swamp rat and tell me what all of my sisters are up to, ok?" She took a deep breath, and with a smile said: "...or you'll die like the others."
Her name was Tizx.
Years flew by, as Tizx's influenced increased in the area with the aid of her servant reporting every move of her enemies and it wasn't long before Jor started showing signs that he was being tainted by her significant influence. He meditated as she performed rituals, trained with her in close combat, often battered to within an inch of his life and watched as, in the blink of an eye, she conjured up cyclones to smite her foes. Jor had seen many such battles for one so young and he'd partaken in a fair few himself: his skill, although unorthodox, with a blade often proved to be useful. However, front-line combat had never been his strong suit, he had been trained to evade sight at all costs: shrouding himself from both the physical and mental realms, tracking and trapping were all now in his repertoire. He bent the vegetation to perform his bidding to guide his prey unwittingly from their usual paths to a series of traps where his mistress could do what she liked with them.
However it was not long before Tizx's power had grown so much that she had drawn unwanted attention from external sources. Jor was out on a routine scout, when he felt like what was a massive void suddenly appear within him, brushing it off as another one of Tizx's tricks he continued as planned. That evening he returned to their home to find her dead, a battered looking bearded human sitting in their hut, the cerulean hue of his lightsaber illuminating the area. He stood up, startled upon seeing Jor.
"Who are you? I didn't sense anyone else here." He said, his voice quavered at first but then strengthened by the force exerted an element of authority.
"I did her bidding. Anything she asked, I performed." Jor said, exerting no emotion at seeing his fallen master.
"Well, you're free now....do as you wish." Continued the Jedi, unsure of what to do with him.
"Free?" Jor spoke softly this time, letting his guards down that hid his power and presence. The Jedi's eyes, which had been scouring the forestline until now, fixed upon Jor. "But what will I do?"
"You'll come to Corruscant."

</details>

**Past Adventures:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The human that found Jor was Carl Incarna, whose main reason for bringing Jor to the Temple was to examine the influence of the Nightsister on his body, their dark powers still a mystery to most within the Order. Carl was one of many Knights, recruited into the ExploCorps to help them deal with some of the more aggressive research operations they faced. His current mandate was in the discovery of locations that had been tainted by the force, and if possible any artefact that had caused such a disturbance. This was how he stumbled upon Jor. The forests on Dathomir teemed with the force: huge creatures, their will broken, were under the command of powerful individuals, who hadn't been traditionally trained.
The Knight saw much potential in his subject, and while aboard a Republic scout ship, their symbiotic relationship of training for research flourished and it was not long before Carl suggested that Jor attempted the trials. Jor's time with ExploCorps had taught him much about the Jedi and what they stood for and he was now well versed in their manta, so passing that part of the trial seemed to be straightforward. For the second part of his trial, he was tasked with constructing a lightsaber and then displaying his combat prowess with it in a demonstration. Luckily for Jor, he'd seen not only his Master's lightsaber but also many other ones as they journeyed from system to system, many of ancient design no longer used in modern construction methods. With the materials and crystals given, he constructed a simple blade that fit his stature. He didn't much care for the lightsaber, he had always been told that it was supposed to be an extension of oneself, but it never felt quite right in Jor's grip, whether this was because of his previous mistress, versed in creating weapons empowered by the force itself, he did not know. Jor was blindfolded, as was the custom, before he ignited his blade. The lightsaber kata, a series of choreographed moves in the Shii-Cho form, that he performed seemed unrefined, not all to his own fault as the Council had ordered Carl only to give him the very basics in combat seeing Jor as potentially dangerous, but he saw it through to the end with a few slip-ups along the way, getting several stings as the training droids seared his flesh with their laser bolts. The third and final trial he was tasked with saw him facing the Dark Side of the force, testing him to see if he could resist its temptation. A crimson crystal was brought before him and he once again felt the dark side of the Force coursing through it. The darker side of the Force had become familiar to him on their various exploration missions and with what he'd learnt he has able to resist it to a degree.
"We've learnt all we can from his holocron, all of its information except it' previous master's gatekeeper has already been erased, you are tasked with striking the final blow." The council decreed.
Before opening the Holocron, Jor put up various mental defences to barricade him against the upcoming mental onslaught. On opening it was clear that he was outmatched, his first line of defence crumbling from the sheer power of the Gatekeeper as a torrent of dark side energy swept over him. Jor recognised the similar taint to the energy from his former master's tutelage, and was able to resist the psychological attrition that he faced. Minutes passed and after regaining composure in this mental deadlock, Jor with beads of sweat pouring from his face takes the upperhand and within an instant banishes the Gatekeeper, destroying the Holocron from within. The mental excursion had taken a toll on him and he dropped down onto one knee, clenching red crystalline dust in his sweaty palm.
The Council see Jor's ability to withstand the Dark Side as a sign of weakness and that he could unknowingly succumb to it at any time, having deliberately set him a tough Trial. They decree that they must put the safety of the Order above all else and send him to the Corps. In the ExploCorps he would be kept under close scrutiny where his skills could be honed and put to good use, the Masters knowing full well that Jor survived where many other minds would have been permanently addled.

</details>

**Personality:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Generally quiet, extremely furtive and often needed to be asked something three or four times before he snaps out of whatever daydream he seems to be in, Jor can frustrate many of the other Jedi in the Academy. However when you do finally get to talk to him, he seems to be easy going...well at least on the surface.

## Re: [ROTE] Perdition (OPEN)

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-22 22:13:46)

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Jorax Okin</span>**
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
Male Human 26
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
**Faction:** Republic
</div>

**Brief Background:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jorax Okin grew up on the planet **Naboo** where he spent most of his youth playing in the plentiful lakes and forests that dot the landscape there. His family wasn't involved much in politics, and didn't have much wealth or influence, and as a result Jorax never really learned how to fit in with that crowd. He worked the odd job at cantinas or loading freight to help pay the bills and never really had much time for socializing. When he was seventeen he and **Jokin** - his younger brother, and the only person Jorax ever would consider a friend - were holding their annual diving contest. Moments after Jorax went under, a badly damaged battle droid seeking refuge in the glade surprised and killed Jokin. When Jorax returned to the surface his eyes met with incomprehensible horror. The image of gleaming metal running with crimson would be forever etched into his mind. With hot tears flowing freely he leapt out of the water and charged at the droid, now leaning unaware over his victim's body. Seething at the loss of his only brother and one true friend, Jorax flew into a frenzy and beat on his chassis until his knuckles bled and then rent the already crippled droid to pieces. Composure regained, he gently lifted Jokin and attempted to carry him home. The Seperatists had alread taken Theeds however, and much of the surrounding countryside - including his home - was in flames. With nothing left on Naboo but bad memories and a growing desire to avenge his family, he left to join the Republic and rid the galaxy of the Seperatist evils.
Losing his family had a profound affect on Jorax, and he hasn't ever really recovered. He seeks comfort in wreaking havoc on the mechanical hordes - and perhaps in doing so, he may find peace.

</details>

**Past Adventures:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The mundane jobs Jorax worked before the Invasion of Naboo rarely provided much excitement, but one incident in particular stands out:
Aboard the *Inky Squid* in Mon Calamari orbit a mutiny was taking place. The freighter's xenophobic Human crew had cornered the Mon Cal Captain in his quarters and were working fast to blow open the door and obtain the ship's security codes by any means necessary. An independently contracted guard by the name of Jorax Okin hired at the last minute by a suspicious Captain emerged from his hiding place in the stowage and sprang to action. Outnumbered and outgunned, Jorax quietly affixed a safety line to his belt and then opened fire at the duraplex window closest the mutineers. Caught completely unprepared, they were swallowed by the cold vacuum of space. After he sealed off the breach he proceeded to calmly inform the Captain of his late crew's location outside the aft hull. He awarded Jorax double pay for saving his life with minimal damage to his ship.
Lately Jorax has been following Republic forces, serving as additional security for low-risk regions and minimal pay. He has hopes of taking part in something larger, but knows it may take some time.

</details>

**Personality:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jorax is not "dark" per se, just quiet and uninterested in things that don't directly affect him. He's been hurt and anyone who takes a minute can see he doesn't want to talk about it. Beyond that, though, he can be a very faithful companion. He inwardly wants a friend but is afraid to lose another, and so hides his true feelings. The comraderie and common ground of working with Loyalists has brought him out of his shell a bit, and he's even caught himself laughing once or twice - something he hasn't done much of since losing Jokin and his family. He's not exactly uncomfortable around droids and has even worked on them before, but definitely has an innate distrust of them. He studies them like any good warrior would study his enemies, and Jorax looks forward with almost unnatural pleasure in battling wave after wave of them in combat, lost in the sights and sounds of mechanical death.

</details>

**You Ended Up Here Because …**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jorax has been following Loyalist forces hoping to land employment as a hired gun or, better yet, frontline soldier. So far he's managed to get along well enough helping patrol low-risk areas, one of which included **Tirahnn**. If he isn't given a more permanent position in the Republic's army he'll have to carry on his crusade another way.

</details>

**Notes:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jorax Okin is actually one of my first character builds ever. I never got the chance to use him though because the campaign never got off the ground. I'm pretty flexible with details so feel free to make mention of anything that doesn't work well, or Feats/Talents that would compliment him. In terms of class - I believe he was a Soldier 5, though I may multi-class to round things out depending on who else is in the party. He specialized in pistols and carried both a blaster pistol and an ion pistol, each in a hip holster. He also had a tool kit and some skill at **Mechanics**, as well as some stun grenades and some binder cuffs. Low Charisma, high Dexterity. I've re-written some things out, but his **Destiny (Education)** was to found a fighting tradition that taught single combat against droid enemies (like the **Ginaz mercenaries**, if you're familiar with the *Dune* series). As a fan of juxtaposition and irony, it might be nice to have Jorax lose a limb or an eye - to be faced with a cybernetic replacement. Discovering a particular party responsible for his family's death might be nice, and I think some *Unleashed* might be called for.
Regarding appearance - Jorax dresses pretty casual, reflecting his lower-class upbringing and general disdain of shallow politics. When not specifically engaged in combat, he carries his gear in a simple canvas pack - perhaps leaving one pistol on his hip. He wears a single dirty cog on a string around his neck, a constant reminder of the battle droid that took his brother.
**Edit:** Changed some background a bit to fit the campaign better. I'm still not committed to any build, and while it seems appropriate to go with a pistol-weilding Soldier/Scoundrel, I'm willing to take on a Mechanic or even Pilot roll as well. The "odd jobs" he worked before the Invasion can round out in many ways.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Rha Ordo A.K.A.: Ba&#39;yair Jetii</span>**
male Yuzzem late twenties early thirties
**Faction:** Separatists
**Brief Background:** Along with many of his species, Rha was employed by the Separatists for many engagements, and often worked alongside Mandalorian mercenaries. During a battle his faction was loosing thanks to the arrival of Jedi forces Rha and three Mandalorians were the only survivors of their massive army. Due to his loyalty and dedication one of the Mandos adopted him, and indoctrinated him in the true warrior's ways. After several more encounters with Jedi, he began developing ways to eliminate them: massive floods of fire, explosives, getting in close and finishing quickly. He became known as Ba'yair Jetii, the Jedi Chewer, due to the condition of the corpses he left. The fact that Yuzzem don't view eating other species as cannibalism helped the name stick.
**Past Adventures:** lots of war stories go here.
**Personality:** Jovial and rambunctious with his fellows and clansmen, Rha is actually fun to be around if you can get past his size and beastly looks. Loud and generally only serious when in combat, Rha has mixed feelings about the droids he often leads: they rarely fail and are never lazy, but they don't laugh or party either: something he sees as necessary for coping with the things seen and done on the battlefield.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** He left Ragna III to join the war, and simply bettered himself and his paycheck by becoming a Mandalorian when the opportunity presented itself.
Light gray, very neutral. If he had a different profession he could be a great guy.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Lay Guun</span>**
Male Neimoidian late thirties
**Faction:** Separatists
**Brief Background:** Lay Guun made his fortune through his masterful administration skills, penchant for technology, and political savvy. His superiors in the Trade Federation were pleased that he had not chosen one area and dedicated himself to it, because if he had he would have quickly threatened one of their positions. Lay was aware of this, and like most of his kind, was incredibly cunning. He had a plan to rise to prominence in spite of his lack of focus: a plan that was cut short by the war. He quickly found his skills in great demand on different fronts, and found another specialty: military tactics. The combination of his skills and his willingness to cut and run saved many millions of credits worth of material repeatedly, and he had no qualms with hit and run tactics and catching his enemies off guard with unorthodox tactics.
**Past Adventures:** While contesting one planet with the Republic, he had entire battalions fitted with environmental sealing and hidden beneath an ocean powered down to resist scans. He then abandoned the planet to the Republic invaders, going forth to attack the base they had rallied at, decimating it, then waiting long enough for the Republic commanders to hear of it and send back reinforcements. He then activated the battalions in hiding, who rose to wipe out the understaffed Republic garrisons while his fleet wiped out their separated and severely weakened armada through guerrilla tactics in the space lanes between the two planets.
**Personality:** Calm and professional at all times, Lay Guun shares his species fear of death, but does not let it control him. He understands his troops strengths and weaknesses, and understands the logistics of war. He appreciates fine arts and has expensive tastes. He believes in the power of logic and knowledge, and believes passion and bravery to be the height of stupidity.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** When the leaders of the Federation allowed themselves to be duped into starting the war he stayed due to loyalty and a distrust of the Republic, and is determined to see his people win their freedom to trade how they see fit.
Dark gray-Black. He's a bad man and makes no bones about it.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Taven Ulsa</span>**
Male Human mid-twenties
**Faction:** Separatist
**Brief Background:** Born to Toren Usla, Republic Senator from Bastion, Taven grew with a silver tongue, an immense fortune, a spoiled personality, and the most beautiful body money could buy. He used these things in pursuit of his baser lusts: women, only the most attractive; spice, only the highest grade; flaunting the law, only the most strict. His father kept him from suffering any consequences and otherwise ignored the boy. After he had reached the age of 23, he met an aristocrat in his father's office named Dooku, who took an interest in the him. Dooku invited him aboard his yacht, where he had the boy beaten to the point of death repeatedly. Dooku expected the boy to relent, to beg for mercy, instead he simply became more vicious and determined to slay his captors. After a week Dooku released him, and offered him the training he would need to ensure that he would never again be treated that way. The boy gladly accepted. By age 26 he had mastered the saber, but had shown that his potential in the Force was weak. He realized this before his master, and played to it, knowing he would be killed if found wanting. He made it plain he had no intention of being a master, he simply wished to enjoy the power serving a great master granted him. Dooku accepted this, knowing he could kill the boy easily enough. Dooku quickly found his next protégé, Asajj Ventress. Taven found himself obsessed with the powerful and attractive female, mostly because she despised him, thought him weak. Since then, he has been a loyal servant to Dooku and oft battered and rebuffed suitor to Ventress.
**Past Adventures:** Ventress has tried to kill him repeatedly and has almost succeeded on several occasions. Taven tends to taunt her into attacking him after she turns him down, and Dooku allows it, claiming that she won't prove herself worthy of the Sith until she can kill him or keep him from manipulating her so easily.
**Personality:** Spoiled, arrogant, condescending, and petty, but not stupid.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** Dooku sent him.
Stuck him here cause there's no way he'll get approved lol.
Black. Evil and likes it.

### **Vermillion** (2011-04-23 23:52:34)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Vancero Narcassan</span>**
Male Human in late 20s
**Faction:** Separatist Privateer
**Brief Background:** Vancero was the only child of Harman Narcassan, then head of the Narcassan noble family on Serenno. One of the lesser houses, they did not have much in the way of power, but they had their share, thanks mainly to Harman's thriving shipping empire. His mother died before he became a teen, and his father poured all his love and grief into him. As such, he was groomed to take over the business and seemingly spoiled rotten. While he could have cared less about the fortune, he treasured his parents' love. If there was anyone who commanded as much of his respect and admiration as his parents, it was one man: Count Dooku.
Vancero followed the man's life and teachings as much as possible. the charisma, the talent, the utter essence of of the former Jedi Master impressed Vancero greatly, and more than anything, he wanted to become as powerful and influential as Dooku. When he was discovered to be Force-sensitive, his father refused to send him to the Jedi Temple for training, fearing he would not return. At first frustrated in his goals, he instead made a compromise: he would stay with the family and inherit the business, but they had to fund special tutoring for his talents in private. Using the considerable resources of the family, Harman again indulged his son, finding the best instructors in literature, lore, politics, tactics, and the sciences, and was even able to find a few former Jedi to teach him of the Force and lightsaber fencing. This hyper-condensed education honed Vancero's mind and body into a fine specimen, impressing all but the one man he sought to emulate. It wasn't that Dooku did not approve, he probably would. But he was far too busy with the burgeoning Confederacy to even take notice.
Harman was eventually approached by the Confederacy for support as they took power on Seranno. In a rare display of nerve, he refused, declaring his neutrality in the matter. Instead of removing Harman permanently, they instead paid off his pilots and crew to smuggle weapons and funds for the Separatists without his knowledge. This ended after a massive raid on his company's vessels by overzealous Republic forces, utterly ruining the company's standing with their more loyalist customers. The scandal destroyed House Narcassan, and Harman died of a stroke soon after.
Vancero blamed the war and the Republic for wrecking his family and taking away the one person that meant the most to him. He joined the confederacy, now focusing his mind on two goals: impressing he father he never had, and avenging the father he lost too soon.
He wandered the stars, using the last bits of his family fortune to fund his travels.
**Past Adventures:** Vancero ended up on a ship that was commandeered by pirates. Pressed into service, his talents led to him eventually serving as first mate on the vessel. They have raided quite a few ships on both sides, but he took much more pleasure disrupting the Republic ships.
**Personality:** For someone with so much pain inside, he is actually a quite calm and chipper fellow. His father was a man with a big laugh and a bigger heart, and both were passed to his son. But make no mistake, Vancero will cut a man down as fast as any if they manage to cross him. He tends to stay quiet and reserved when meeting new people, seeking to listen and consider his thoughts before speaking. But once he eases, he displays his more...eccentric proclivities. Due to his cloistered upbringing, he has some difficulty relating to others, and tends to get a bit conceited and egotistical, especially when it comes to anything related to Count Dooku. He often dresses like him, in maroons and reds, and still uses a basic fencing lightsaber in honor of him.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** After a nasty altercation involving the captain, his high quality and quite expensive lightsaber, and a misunderstanding about property rights, Vancero had to leave their company. he is now somewhat freelance, and while the Republic saw fit to place a bounty on his head, the Separatists instead gave him a letter of marque, only accepting due to his respect for Dooku and his animosity towards the Republic. He now finds himself on this small planet seeking out his own ship, as well as hook up with the Separatist forces there.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Jothan Kamal</span>**
Male Human (Korun) 25
**Faction:** Republic (Intelligence)
**Brief Background:** A street kid who grew up running the streets of Pelek Baw, Jothan Kamal had a tough life. His parents a mystery, it was almost as if the city itself birthed him, a rambunctious child who often got himself in trouble way above his ability to handle. This taught him to adapt, to be prepared for nearly any eventuality. This also taught him that a well-placed knife was just as good as a key.
After joining the ULF, Jothan was trained in guerrilla tactics and combat, as well as some basic Pelekotan training. He had very little exposure to his native culture growing up, and wasn't the most effective front-line soldier. But he was savvy, and was a lot more familiar with technology than a lot of his peers. So he was switched to a more technical role, acting as messenger, slicer, and saboteur. This is what led to him making contact with the Washeteria and the Republic Intelligence group therein.
Dissatisfaction with the leadership and goals of the group (namely their steadily increasing violence against non-combatants) had led him to spend more and more time with the local Intel agents working Pelek Baw. He eventually became a full agent, and while still helping his ULF allies, grew more comfortable with the more subdued and covert group. After some bad intel led to his cover being blown, he volunteered to leave Haruun Kal to keep the other agents safe.
**Past Adventures:** After leaving Haruun Kal, Jothan was transferred to a covert ops team assigned to neutralize Separatist targets without open combat. Assigned as the team slicer, he was given even more specialized training and tech. His first few missions with the group were successful, and he even garnered praise and a medal for his actions on a fairly sensitive operation. The op in question would have failed significantly if Jothan had not rooted out a traitor amongst his group, who had sold out to the Confederacy and planned to kill the entire team. Jothan confronted the man, and after a vicious hand-to-hand battle (one that demonstrated that Jothan still had considerable skill with the Force), he killed the traitor and saved his group from a sabotaged ship reactor with his technical skills.
**Personality:** Jothan has developed a fairly ruthless pragmatism during his days in the ULF and Intel. He sees no reason for a "fair fight"; if someone is trying to kill him, it is hardly fair. Otherwise, he is a nice, if sometimes curt, individual. He'd much rather slice and keep his distance than engage the enemy directly, but when backed into a corner, he is as ferocious as the akk dogs of his homeworld. He has a soft spot for children, particularly street runners.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** After the excitement and drama of his last mission, Jothan opted to "take a break", and requested to be shipped to a most sedate assignment. He was posted on Tirahnn, where he assisted in monitoring the the growing Separatist influence there. He was there barely a month before the Confederacy took over. He declared his vacation over and went back to work running info raids and building assets.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">NP-3328 (Crona)</span>**
Medium Human 38
**Faction:**Separatist
**Brief Background:**Crona spent most of his on Nar Shadaa with his family. Needless to say he was introduced to crime at a young age. The main thing that caught his eye was explosives. After watching what his father could do with a few well placer frags and missiles that was all he needed to see. I didn't take him long to start helping his father on jobs and other things. His father was more than happy take him along with him. One, he wasn't a bad shot with a missile launcher. Two, the sight of a fifteen year old kid with a missile launcher caught some people off guard, which allowed him to blow them away. The next five years went by with him taking jobs and making a name for himself. One of those jobs lead him to getting imprisoned. After spending twelve years in jail he eventual escaped and decided to get his revenge on the republic that imprisoned him, after he blew up a few droids.
**Past Adventures:**Most of his jobs took place on Nar Shadaa. It wasn't until he was eighteen that he was able to take his own jobs and leave the planet. He even got a few jobs from the Separatist. It was his last job that got him caught.
**Personality:**Crona is smiling most the time and always like to have a good time. He especially enjoys fighting and blowing things up. He also no longer refers to himself by his name, he just goes by his prison tag number. Most the time people think that he needs to be locked up again.
**You Ended Up Here Because …**He's wanted by the republic and he is more than happy to work for free so long as he gets to fight some republic soldiers.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Umdrow Guuhan</span>**
Male Ithorian 40
**Faction:** Separatist
**Brief Background:** Umdrow Guuhan was the youngest Priest of his people, leading his herd for years before the Clone Wars. Shortly after the war began, his herd ship was caught in a crossfire between Separatist and Republic forces and destroyed over Felucia. He and a small handful of his herd survived, and the Felucian wildlife made quick work of the survivors. Soon, Umdrow was alone, and began studying the Dark Side. The events in his life changed his views on the Force, and he could no longer see a division between Light and Dark. He saw only the Force, in its constant cycle of Life and Death. He survived for years as a hermit, learning from and trading with the natives when necessary. Once the Separatists made their place on Felucia, Dooku sought Umdrow out, offering him training and power to strike back at the Republic, which Umdrow believed responsible for his herd's death. Umdrow refused, knowing such actions were wrong. Dooku countered with pointing out the Republic's corruption and decay, arguing the ancient mad beast needed to be put down for the greater good. This argument worked, and Umdrow soon joined the Separatist's cause, not out of hate, but because he thought it necessary.
**Past Adventures:** At one point during training Dooku began telling Umdrow of the Sith and their beliefs. Umdrow listened and then told Dooku he had no interest in such blind naiveté. He told Dooku there was no Dark Side, nor a Light, and that any who devoted themselves to moral absolutes in such a way denied the true nature of the Force. Later, Dooku relayed this to Sidious, who said, **"Keep him. He will never threaten us. A refusal to choose is a choice in itself, and often the wrong one."** Dooku complied, and Umdrow has served the Separatists since.
**Personality:** Incredibly wise and seemingly stand-offish, Umdrow works well with droids who don't question his motives.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** Umdrow is a powerful being, sent where he is needed.
Gray. Neutral and proud of it.

Male Human late thirties
**Faction:** Separatists
**Brief Background:** Born and raised by the Uundoe Clan of Mandalore, Kyramla is an expert sniper. He was hired along with many of his brothers as mercenaries by the Separatists, and made a name for himself through his abilities in stealth, scouting, and assassination. His clan specializes in camouflage and long range shooting, coupled with silent, deadly martial arts.
**Past Adventures:** Kyramla found himself stymied by Jedi's ability to deflect shots, and quickly figured out how Jedi new it was coming through experimenting with sniper droids. He learned to quiet his mind, and penetrate their defenses.
**Personality:** A quiet man by training and nature, Kyramla never brags, and thinks deeply, watching his target sometimes for days before acting.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** He's a merc, he goes where he's paid to go.

Thank you to everyone who has put in their concepts, there has been a great turn out. If you are still interested in submitting please feel free to as there is still a slot open for the Republic side.
The following concepts have the go ahead to post up a full character sheet.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Approved Concepts:</span>
Republic
Kieran Tanyon (DarthAnthrax) Echani Jedi with Sun Guard training
Jor Reek (jaybee33) - Zabrak Jedi
Separatist
Mursst (hayabusa) - Trandoshan Mercenary/Bounty Hunter
Vancero Narcassan (Vermillion) - Human Privateer
Umdrow Guuhan (Magical2099) - Ithorian Herd Priest **or**
Kyramla Shev'la (Magical2099) - Human Mandalorian Sniper/Scout
Additionally, as a house rule, you may trade starting class feats for Skill Trainings in your current class list. This trade will need to be notated somewhere on the sheet.
We will also be using a combination of the Backgrounds found in the Rebellion era book and Destiny.

Instead of choosing a Destiny you will instead choose a Background. The Background will work as normal depending on whether Event, Occupation or Origin is chosen. Every odd level you will gain 1 Destiny point instead of 1 every level. Additionally, there are no longer any Destiny bonuses aside from those afforded by talents and other uses of Destiny Points. On occasion, the GM may see fit to award additional DPs for heroic actions or other exceptional actions.
My goal is to start the game on Monday. Please do not post in the campaign forum till your character sheet has been approved. Till then you may either make a new post, or edit your old one. If the latter, please let me know when it is done. The Creation Rules on the first post stands and will be expected.
Thanks you again, and please let me know if you have questions. First post has been updated.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-27 19:59:35)

Okay, so backgrounds works as normal...or? It sounds like we´re restricted to Event backgrounds, and frankly the only thing I can get to make sense for my character is an occupational background.
I´ll see if I have any additional questions and PM them to you soon.

The backgrounds will work as they are described in the book.
Any actually, if there is enough information concerning a planet which hasn't been done I will even work with you to make an Origin background.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-27 20:48:38)

OK, just checking. I´ll probably settle for an Occupation background, to represent the work he and his master did during his early years in the Jedi Order. Currently looking at Law Enforcement, but Politics could be interesting as well.

Background, Personality, Etc.<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Faction: Separatist
Brief Background: Umdrow Guuhan was the youngest Priest of his people, leading his herd for years before the Clone Wars. Shortly after the war began, his herd ship was caught in a crossfire between Separatist and Republic forces and destroyed over Felucia. He and a small handful of his herd survived, and the Felucian wildlife made quick work of the survivors. Soon, Umdrow was alone, and began studying the Dark Side. The events in his life changed his views on the Force, and he could no longer see a division between Light and Dark. He saw only the Force, in its constant cycle of Life and Death. He survived for years as a hermit, learning from and trading with the natives when necessary. Once the Separatists made their place on Felucia, Dooku sought Umdrow out, offering him training and power to strike back at the Republic, which Umdrow believed responsible for his herd's death. Umdrow refused, knowing such actions were wrong. Dooku countered with pointing out the Republic's corruption and decay, arguing the ancient mad beast needed to be put down for the greater good. This argument worked, and Umdrow soon joined the Separatist's cause, not out of hate, but because he thought it necessary.
Past Adventures: At one point during training Dooku began telling Umdrow of the Sith and their beliefs. Umdrow listened and then told Dooku he had no interest in such blind naiveté. He told Dooku there was no Dark Side, nor a Light, and that any who devoted themselves to moral absolutes in such a way denied the true nature of the Force. Later, Dooku relayed this to Sidious, who said, "Keep him. He will never threaten us. A refusal to choose is a choice in itself, and often the wrong one." Dooku complied, and Umdrow has served the Separatists since.
Personality: Incredibly wise and seemingly stand-offish, Umdrow works well with droids who don't question his motives.
You Ended Up Here Because ... Umdrow is a powerful being, sent where he is needed.

**Lay Guun** CL 6
Male Neimoidian late thirties
**Faction:** Separatists
**Brief Background:** Lay Guun made his fortune through his masterful administration skills, penchant for technology, and political savvy. His superiors in the Trade Federation were pleased that he had not chosen one area and dedicated himself to it, because if he had he would have quickly threatened one of their positions. Lay was aware of this, and like most of his kind, was incredibly cunning. He had a plan to rise to prominence in spite of his lack of focus: a plan that was cut short by the war. He quickly found his skills in great demand on different fronts, and found another specialty: military tactics. The combination of his skills and his willingness to cut and run saved many millions of credits worth of material repeatedly, and he had no qualms with hit and run tactics and catching his enemies off guard with unorthodox tactics.
**Past Adventures:** While contesting one planet with the Republic, he had entire battalions fitted with environmental sealing and hidden beneath an ocean powered down to resist scans. He then abandoned the planet to the Republic invaders, going forth to attack the base they had rallied at, decimating it, then waiting long enough for the Republic commanders to hear of it and send back reinforcements. He then activated the battalions in hiding, who rose to wipe out the understaffed Republic garrisons while his fleet wiped out their separated and severely weakened armada through guerrilla tactics in the space lanes between the two planets.
**Personality:** Calm and professional at all times, Lay Guun shares his species fear of death, but does not let it control him. He understands his troops strengths and weaknesses, and understands the logistics of war. He appreciates fine arts and has expensive tastes. He believes in the power of logic and knowledge, and believes passion and bravery to be the height of stupidity.
**What he can do:** Guun acts as supplier and general provider on demand. Their mutual ties through the Separatists and a firm understanding of each other make for a good working relationship, unlike most Force user/Naval pairings. Guun and his small fleet complete with ground assault army are never more than a few systems away, with Umdrow often being sent in alone or with a bevy of sentinel droids to scout an area. Guun has strict orders to never abuse his command and would not risk it regardless, and Umdrow is not the kind to ask for more than extraction even in the most extreme circumstances.
Dumping all my credits into this guy.

Description <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Standing two meters tall and weighing roughly one hundred kilograms with out his armor, Umdrow is a tall and lanky Ithorian. His muscles are wiry and rope like, and his stance is relaxed and at peace. His eyes are soulful, and seem to peer off into murky depths. His armor is an odd amalgamation of various fossilized plant life held in place with leather straps. Each piece from a different plant: his chest plate, an outer bark fossil from a Wroshyr tree; his right pauldron, a spiky protrusion covered hull from a Gruhuk tree on Gamor; his left, a smaller, smoother piece of Veshok heartwood from Mandalore; dozens of other smaller pieces from all across the galaxy stud his arms and legs. Each piece is unique, with colors ranging from dark green, slate grey, and deep brown; some smaller pieces vary wildly in color, being black, red, yellow, and even vibrant orange. A luxurious hand made cape of fibers from a Knobby White Spider of Dagobah, whose colors seem to shift depending on his surroundings is pinned around his neck with a Rancor's tooth, and has a hood. His Great Lightsaber's outer casing is made of the dark Kriin-wood of Alderaan, and it's blade is a deep hunter green. In reverence of his people's views on his home planet, he bears no talisman of Ithor.

Background
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Born on Trandosha nearly 30 years ago, Mursst came from a long line of moderately successful hunters. He was trained from an early age on how best to hunt down his foes, and how best to dispatch them once he found them. Upon reaching adulthood, he underwent a hunting rite of passage on a moon near his homeworld: tracking a captured wookiee through the jungle. The two met face to face three days after the hunt began, and Mursst lost his right arm in the fight. The wookiee was killed.
It took slightly longer than normal for Mursst's arm to regenerate, and even to this day it twitches slightly due to the nerves not being 100% correct. On occasion, he's been tempted to just cut it off and let it grow back again, but fears that this will only make it worse.
Mursst joined a couple of mercenary groups, taking the odd job every now and then if it paid well, not really caring what it might entail. When the Clone Wars began, he was semi-permanently hired by a CIS general along with a team of other mercs. When Tirahnn was besieged, Mursst lead his small team into the wilderness, taking out clone squads scouting the area.

He removes his helmet and reveals that he is a Trandoshan. The scales around his face are a slight greenish-brown, and he stretches his jaw slightly, revealing sharp teeth. If you look closely, even though he tries to hide it, his left arm trembles slightly.

**Hayabusa**
You can remove your statblock from the spoiler and when you post it in the sheet thread turn smileys off (there's a check box at the bottom before the submit button to disable). Please make sure too, that you use the post model, keeping the text formatting.
Level breakdown - You forgot to indicate your abilities at level 1 and 4. From what I can tell, you forgot to increase them at level 4.
I would list Darkvision with your senses IE: **Senses** Darkvision, Perception +10
HP 82 (30 soldier1 + (3*10)soldier + (2*8) scout + 6 con*level)
Please put Reflex before Fort when listing.
Reflex 24 = 10 +2 class +1 species +1 mod +6 level +4 armor
Fort 21 = 10 +2 class +1 mod +6 level +2 armor
Melee smash gives you +1 dmg to melee attacks, add bonus into your vibroblade and then you can remove it from your atk options
Armored Defense should be Armor Defense Mastery as per my House Rule change.
Shake it Off requires CON 13 (maybe CON was one of the abilities you meant to increase?)
Skills - add/replace to stat block
Perception +10 (may reroll taking second roll), Stealth +4 (may reroll taking second roll)
Just curious, why did you take Improved Stealth when you aren't trained in Stealth?
Optionally yet suggested, you can include Ride as you have the +2 bonus from your background. It's generally good to list anything which isn't of the norm.
Is your character really going to be that evil with 7 DSPs?
That's all the nitpicks/changes I can see.
**Edit**: Don't forget about your Favors.

### **Alicia** (2011-04-29 20:46:20)

**Magical**
Breakdown has level listing as Scout 1 / Jedi 3 / Soldier 2, but your stat block doesn't.
Destiny - include your Background here. If you picked one you didn't mention it.
Defense -

Reflex 24 = 10 + 2 class +2 int (Predictive Defense) +6 level + 4 armor
You put your DT as 21 but your Fort is listed at 22 <!– s:lol: –>![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!– s:lol: –>
I suggested to hayabusa you should probably make a notation of what your Defenses will be without armor in (). IE:
**Defenses** Ref 24 (Flat footed 22), Fort 21, Will 23 (without armor Reflex 20 (18), Fort 19); Predictive Defense
Skills - 1 unassigned (5+2mod + 2 trade); add: Survival +11 (may reroll taking second result)
Please list skills alphabetically in your clean up.
Armor Mastery is Armored Defense Mastery
Block/Deflect is Defend, and this should be listed with your Defenses. (see DA's sheet)
You get the basic lightsaber for free. You could trade in the cost of it for the great saber, but you'd still have to pay the difference and for any upgrades to it. Please double check your equipment costs.
Don't forget to format it. Hope to see your favors soon. You've got a good start <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

His body is slender and muscular, though somewhat intimidating. It has its effeminate looks, but just enough so, to be extremely attractive. Minor scars dot the surface of his skin, stories (whether true or not) behind them all. To look at him wouldn't be enough. A mere glance would not satisfy your curiosity. You would stare, unconsciously examining his body. Feeling your interest, he would turn to gaze at you. Then suddenly you would be drawn into his strong, fierce, stunningly blue eyes.

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Male Human in late 20s
**Faction:** Separatist Privateer
**Brief Background:** Vancero was the only child of Harman Narcassan, then head of the Narcassan noble family on Serenno. One of the lesser houses, they did not have much in the way of power, but they had their share, thanks mainly to Harman's thriving shipping empire. His mother died before he became a teen, and his father poured all his love and grief into him. As such, he was groomed to take over the business and seemingly spoiled rotten. While he could have cared less about the fortune, he treasured his parents' love. If there was anyone who commanded as much of his respect and admiration as his parents, it was one man: Count Dooku.
Vancero followed the man's life and teachings as much as possible. the charisma, the talent, the utter essence of of the former Jedi Master impressed Vancero greatly, and more than anything, he wanted to become as powerful and influential as Dooku. When he was discovered to be Force-sensitive, his father refused to send him to the Jedi Temple for training, fearing he would not return. At first frustrated in his goals, he instead made a compromise: he would stay with the family and inherit the business, but they had to fund special tutoring for his talents in private. Using the considerable resources of the family, Harman again indulged his son, finding the best instructors in literature, lore, politics, tactics, and the sciences, and was even able to find a few former Jedi to teach him of the Force and lightsaber fencing. This hyper-condensed education honed Vancero's mind and body into a fine specimen, impressing all but the one man he sought to emulate. It wasn't that Dooku did not approve, he probably would. But he was far too busy with the burgeoning Confederacy to even take notice.
Harman was eventually approached by the Confederacy for support as they took power on Seranno. In a rare display of nerve, he refused, declaring his neutrality in the matter. Instead of removing Harman permanently, they instead paid off his pilots and crew to smuggle weapons and funds for the Separatists without his knowledge. This ended after a massive raid on his company's vessels by overzealous Republic forces, utterly ruining the company's standing with their more loyalist customers. The scandal destroyed House Narcassan, and Harman died of a stroke soon after.
Vancero blamed the war and the Republic for wrecking his family and taking away the one person that meant the most to him. He joined the confederacy, now focusing his mind on two goals: impressing he father he never had, and avenging the father he lost too soon.
He wandered the stars, using the last bits of his family fortune to fund his travels.
**Past Adventures:** Vancero ended up on a ship that was commandeered by pirates. Pressed into service, his talents led to him eventually serving as first mate on the vessel. They have raided quite a few ships on both sides, but he took much more pleasure disrupting the Republic ships.
**Personality:** For someone with so much pain inside, he is actually a quite calm and chipper fellow. His father was a man with a big laugh and a bigger heart, and both were passed to his son. But make no mistake, Vancero will cut a man down as fast as any if they manage to cross him. He tends to stay quiet and reserved when meeting new people, seeking to listen and consider his thoughts before speaking. But once he eases, he displays his more...eccentric proclivities. Due to his cloistered upbringing, he has some difficulty relating to others, and tends to get a bit conceited and egotistical, especially when it comes to anything related to Count Dooku. He often dresses like him, in maroons and reds, and still uses a basic fencing lightsaber in honor of him.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** After a nasty altercation involving the captain, his high quality and quite expensive lightsaber, and a misunderstanding about property rights, Vancero had to leave their company. he is now somewhat freelance, and while the Republic saw fit to place a bounty on his head, the Separatists instead gave him a letter of marque, only accepting due to his respect for Dooku and his animosity towards the Republic. He now finds himself on this small planet seeking out his own ship, as well as hook up with the Separatist forces there.

Abilities - Your attributes in the level break down do not match what you have on your sheet, same for what was increased.
DP - You start with 3 DP (every odd level you gain 1 DP). Please indicate your Background with your DP. IE **DP** 3 (orphan event)
Remove DR from the listing
Is the immune listing from your background?
BAB is +5. Due to my houserule you do not start over on 3/4 bab scales, instead making multi-class levels with 3/4 bab accumulate. Change weapon attacks and grapple to accommodate.
You didn't notate source of Silver Tongue and Adaptable Talent.
Otherwise the stats look good so far. Now just work up a description and your Favors after you've finished your equipment.

TO EVERYONE: Favors
You may PM the favors to me.
A background and personality must be included with the CL if you are not going to stat the favor out.
The former is very important as I need an idea of how you intend on them to be portrayed, where they come from and how they are affiliated with your character. Also if I don't know what they can do, where they've been, etc, I don't know how they will be of help to your character when it comes time to call on them.
Favors will need to be turned in no later than the end of May, but please don't procrastinate on this, but take your time to get everything together and worked out.
If you are having difficulties please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Kieran was born on Keshan, the Echani homeworld in the Inner Rim. Born as the son of two mid-ranking officers in the Keshan Defense Force, he was introduced to the world of military tactics and personal combat. As it were , he proved to have a keen tactical mind, and it was almost as if he could perceive his opponents moves before they were made. While such skills are not unheard of among Echani soldiers, it usually follows from years of experience and training.
As it were, a traveling Jedi Knight named Sai-Dan passing through the Keshan system took notice of Kieran, and upon closer examination discovered the boy to be sensitive to the Force. With the blessing of his parents, the Cerean Jedi brought him to Coruscant and the Jedi Temple, where he would begin his training to become a Jedi Knight. True to Jedi tradition, Kieran remained in training under the watchful eyes of Grand Master Yoda for several years, but when the time came, Sai-Dan returned to take him as his padawan learner.
Gifted with the logical mind of a Cerean, Sai-Dan often traveled the Inner and Mid Rims, acting as adviser and supervisor of Republic diplomats, and on missions to less reputed worlds, bodyguard. Following his master on these missions, Kieran found that the plotting and intrigues of the political world was not so much different from the military world he had grown up in. Still, even though his master continuously scolded him for it, he was more at home in the barracks among soldiers and security personnel, and often even expressed a hope that something would go “wrong” on a mission. While they were an odd pair indeed, the two developed a deep understanding and a powerful bond, and even whan Kieran felt like his place was perhaps not in the Jedi Order, he never questioned or disobeyed his master. It was not until a few years before the Battle of Geonosis that their bond would truly be put to the ultimate test.
With rumors surfacing that the Sun Guard of Thyrsus, a splinter group of Echani mercenaries, had allied themselves with the reemerging Sith Lords, Kieran and his master were sent to Thyrsus to investigate. Despite a thorough investigation, all leads turned up false, and while the Sun Guard wasn´t ultimately happy about their presence they made no efforts to stall the investigation. As they were readying themselves to leave Thyrsus, Kieran and his master were approached by a rather unusual offer. Given his Echani background, Kieran was offered to stay on Thyrsus and train with the Sun Guard, and learning more of his Echani culture. Sai-Dan, who had a lingering suspicion that something was out of order, despite their lack of findings, told Kieran that the choice was his, and if he decided to stay, he could continue their assignment. And so the decision was made.
Kieran remained on Thyrsus for more than two years, during which time he was trained on both Sun Guard fighting skills and battle tactics. While he continued to train in lightsaber combat, he also trained with more archaic blades and polearms, and even practiced combat using simple battle armor for protection. In their business as mercenaries, the Sun Guard also practiced many other skills, and soon he was proficient in the hacking and encryption of communications systems, analyzing intelligence data, and directing artillery fire. Finding himself very much at home, his continued investigation started to fade into the background of his life, and he felt more and more like he belonged on Thyrsus.
Two years later though, his existence would change quite abruptly. From out of nowhere, without any communication ahead, and apparently without being noticed on arrival, Sai-Dan turned up on Thyrsus. The Cerean brought dire news to his former padawan, and told him that Master Windu had issued a call for all available Jedi to assemble at Geonosis to rescue two captive Jedi. While he hadn´t felt as fully part of the Jedi Order for a while, Kieran did not question his master, and prepared to leave. That was when everything fell apart around him.
Having arrived unnoticed, Sai-Dan had hoped to slip out the same way, a plan that unfortunately failed. As they were moving with haste through the streets of Thyrsus, heading for where the Cerean had hidden his ship, blasterfire started to fly around their heads. As he turned around, Kieran saw several armored members of the Sun Guard coming their way, weapons raised and firing. Confused at the sudden turn of events, and dulled in his Jedi instincts after living away from the Order and regular Force training for so long, Kieran had nevertheless lost his resolve, and understood that this was a matter of life and death, and held nothing back in his fighting to reach their ship.
As they did, however, they were greeted by a brilliant explosion that sent flames towards the sky, and took with it their only means of escaping Thyrsus. As they suddenly found themselves surrounded on two fronts, the pair of Jedi took up a defensive stance, back to back, determined to fight to the end. From the enemy ranks came forward a man that Kieran recognized as Hetton, a senior officer in the Sun Guard, with a crooked smile on his face. Hetton explained to Kieran the ruse. The Sun Guard had in fact allied themselves with the Sith, and more so, they had been working with the Sith to subvert young Jedi they found susceptible, young Jedi who craved the thrill of battle and who didn´t really felt at home in the Jedi life, and draw them away from the Order, that they may eventually join up with the Sith.
The change, he promised, had already begun, and as the plain of Geonosis were covered in the flames of war, a new power would rise, one that would destroy the Republic and its Jedi guardians. It was a shame, he said, that Kieran had been so willing to leave them and follow his old master, rather than remain on Thyrsus, where his place was. If he had done so, he could have taken a place as commander, as the Sun Guard stood by their masters. It was not to late though, he offered. If Kieran would only accept his fate, glory and splendor would still be his. All it would require was that he cut all his ties to his past, and as Hetton put emphasis on the word cut, his men shifted the aims of their rifles towards Sai-Dan.
Even with all that was going on around him, Kieran was surprised at how calm he felt, and even more at the resolve he could feel emanating from his master. Where they should have been in a maelstrom of emotions, they seemed like two immovable objects, shielded in the eye of the storm, and he knew what he had to do. He slowly turned around until he was facing his master, backing away as he did so, and raising his lightsaber over his head in a two-handed grip. As he stepped back, he could feel his awareness expanding, and with every step he could feel the pulse of the troopers surrounding them, their tension, their determination. And then suddenly, their surprise and fear as he moved.
Dropping one hand from his lightsaber, he swept the weapon behind his back to strike at the trooper he knew was there, and even as that one fell to the ground, he was leaping through the air and sending a flying kick towards the temple of the closest one on his right. As he moved, he could feel his master moving out of his sight, using the Force to knock several soldiers over. Blasters started to scream, but bounced harmlessly off twirling lightsabers, and several soldiers fell in the crossfire. Moving with speed and grace, Kieran turned into a whirlwind of destruction, and a combined barrage of lightsaber strikes and precise kicks and punches put down everything in his path. At that moment, he felt more alive than ever, and he could feel the Force rushing through him stronger than ever before as he read the ebbs and flows of his opponents minds, knowing their moves even before they did. It was over in a matter of moments. Two dozen mercenaries, put down almost without effort.
As he turned around, he saw Hetton and Sai-Dan locked close together, but where he first raised his weapon to assist, he soon saw the emerald blade of his master extending from the back of the mercenary officer. As the older man fell to the ground though, he saw something else. The hilt of a blade, fixed steadily into the abdomen of his master. While he knew it was too late, while he could feel his masters strength fading away, he still rushed forward to catch his masters falling form. He looked to the Cerean for some words, a look, any sign of life, but it was too late. Enraged and determined, Kieran wrapped Sai-Dan´s body up in his Jedi robes, and went looking for a way to get off Thyrsus. As a symbol of remembrance, he took the blade that Hetton had used to slay his master as his own. Managing to steal a transport, he was able to make it away, and he soon settled down on Coruscant, where a new Galaxy presented itself to him, a Galaxy of war.
As a masterless padawan, he was assigned to operate with various other Jedi masters on their missions, though his keen tactical mind and uncanny battle prowess soon awarded him with a command of his own, despite his rank only as a padawan. Many said though, that it would not be long before he was given the rank of Jedi Knight.

**Appearance**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Like all Echani, Kieran possesses snow white hair and silvery eyes, and skin paler than most other humanoids. He is, however, in no way a frail individual, and his training both on Thyrsus and in the Jedi Order has helped him build up a baseline physique of note. While he kept his hair short with a pigtail during his initial years as a padawan, he let it grow out again during his stay on Thyrsus, and now it reaches him to the shoulders.
While not in the field, he has taken to wearing Jedi robes of the lighter model, choosing ones in lighter brown/beige and white colors. To put it simple, someone with his pigmentation and hair color looks a bit odd in the darker hues worn by Jedi. Despite his reputation as a fierce and relentless warrior, there always seems to be a calm about him and he usually keeps a level head in most circumstances.
In the field, he usually dons a set of light battle armor that he brought with him from Thyrsus, which he has had the Republics engineers modify and augment where he saw it necessary. The armor itself is light and flexible enough not to hinder movement, but is padded and outfitted to protect key points, rendering him less vulnerable to blunt trauma.

</details>

**Personality**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Cool and level-headed at most times, Kieran has learned the value of patience throughout his life, and often thinks things through before acting. Sometimes, he knows, action must be swift and decisive, and he is not late to make sure it is. His years with Sai-Dan have taught him some basic respect and understanding of the workings of politics, though at most times he remains his own, blunt self. He doesn´t believe in presenting facades or saying things he wont stand for, though he can admittedly become a bit frustrated with other who don´t share those beliefs.

**Story**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

In 32 BBY the Trade Federation landed forces on the planet Naboo. After capturing the city of Theeds, the Separatist droid army moved into the surrounding countryside. They ruthlessly eliminated any resistance, and the few communities that were allowed to surrender were rounded up and imprisoned - a fate some would have been willing to die to avoid had they known what it truly meant. Countless others were slaughtered for no apparent reason. Jorax and his younger brother Jokin were away from home at the time - oblivious to the cold metal death sweeping nearer and nearer. The brothers often played diving games at a place they called Deepwater Pond - a small body of water in a wooded glade not too far from the suburbs of Theeds. It was Jorax's turn to dive to the bottom and retrieve as many stones as possible before returning for air. Moments after he went under, a squad of battle droids spotted Jokin and began firing. His screams were drown in a barrage of blaster fire and his body collapsed in a crumpled heap a few meters from shore. Jorax, having filled his pockets, broke through the pond's surface in a shout of sibling victory. His countenance flashed to horror an instant later. A lone droid stood over his brother's body and fired a last fatal round, splattering droplets from Jokin's body on its chassis. The image of gleaming silver stained with crimson forever would be forever etched into his mind. He hardly heard the primal scream that escaped his lips as he lept out of the water towards the mechanical assassin. With inhuman strength Jorax knocked the droid over and wrestled its blaster rifle away. Firing over and over into the sparking, smoking chassis until twisted metal parts lay strewn about. He stopped only when the weapon was depleted of power. Jorax tossed the rifle away and ran to where his beloved brother had fallen, a Deepwater stone still clenched in his hand. Heaving great sobs of the unimaginable torment that only an older brother could know, he lifted Jokin gently and made his way towards home.
The droids had grown suspicious though, and it became clear to Jorax that several would soon spot him if he didn't turn back. He knew all the best hiding spots in the glade - thanks to Jokin's skill at Seek and Find - and managed to avoid detection in some nearby brush. Realizing he had to abandon his brother's body in order to make it to safety, Jorax carefully set Jokin down and vowed vengeance. He pocketed Jokin's last Deepwater stone to forever remind him of what was lost that day. After the droid squad had moved off, apparently satisfied to leave their comrade's smoking shell behind, he made his best speed for home. There he found some security forces from Theed had made a bunker of sorts and he was able to find shelter inside. Passing by his house Jorax saw the burnt corpses of two adults. One had his mother's cherished pendant still around its neck, the other wearing a smoldering vest that resembled the one he had given his father on his fiftieth birthday.
In the years that followed Jorax Okin traveled with various Republic security forces, always with an interest in who was responsible for the "take no prisoners" attitude that resulted in the deaths of so many loved ones on Naboo. He studied every piece of intelligence available on the droid armies' movements and tactics and analyzed each chunk of scrap that remained in battle. While never refusing orders directly, Jorax wasn't yet an official member of the Galactic Army and could usually manage to get assigned to areas that provided ample opportunity to battle enemies of circuits and metal rather than flesh and bones. He has pursued a more permanent position in the GAR however, in hopes of discovering the Separatist most responsible for the loss of his family and bringing the fullness of his vengeance to bear.
Jorax isn't uncomfortable around droids in general, but doesn't usually carry on conversations at length with them. He believes they serve a purpose, nothing more than a blaster or freighter or any other piece of machinery - and machinery is something Jorax knows a thing or two about. He serves the Republic army in hopes of seeing more frontline action. Specifically, he yearns for the opportunity to rain death on hordes of mechanical soldiers in retaliation for the loss of his family back on Naboo. He has learned the value of comraderie on more than on occasion though, and while he may give a cold first impression there's no doubting his loyalty once earned. Although he's been moved to a seperate squad and Jorax doesn't get to see him much anymore, Pacus Thraus - also a survivor of the Invasion of Naboo - is someone whose fought alongside Jorax dozens of times against the Separatists. Others often referred to the pair as Jax-Pac, and the respective titles stuck as handles and nicknames.
Their last assignment together had them serving as escort for a convoy on its way to the Mon Calamari shipyards. Upon landing it became clear to Jorax that Separatist forces had already taken possession of the port and were in no mood for resistance. He informed Pacus and the two proceeded to improvise. Half a dozen battle droids quickly surrounded them as soon as the they walked down the boarding ramp and - with blaster rifles pointed at their heads - Jorax and Pacus slowly raised their arms and moved aside. Exploiting a known battle droid quirk involving targeting acquisition at ranges under a meter, the pair then whirled around using the closest droids as shields and fired through the openings in their chassis. The skirmish was over in a matter of moments, with six smoldering B-1's littering the landing pad and two unimpressed security agents activating distress beacons. Together, the pair were able to liberate the small port and hold out long enough for the Republic to arrive in force.

**Appearance**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jorax Okin is a quiet young man, and carries the sorrow of childhood innocence lost before its time. So many seem to have been hit hard by the war between the Republic and the Separatist armies, but few have taken it to heart as he has. When not on duty serving as hired security for low-risk regions in Loyalist space he wears simple clothes, reflecting a working-class heritage he's not ashamed of. Around his neck hangs a simple stone, threaded through with some cord - a constant reminder of his vow. Jorax dons his sidearms when patroling settlements on the interior of Republic lines however, and his gait and gaze make it clear he's in no mood for trouble - though he might be willing to stir up some if necessary.

</details>

**At Present**: Jorax was serving as light-duty security on Republic freighter convoys near Tirahnn when the Separatists attacked.

Sorry, but you can only retrain a feat or a talent or a skill 1 per level and starting class feats can only be changed out for a Skill Training at first level only. Retraining was meant for you to exchange a bonus class or level feat you earned during the course of leveling.
I will review it again once this has been fixed.

Okay, guess I must have missed that part. Now this will throw me into a totally different mindset...but I should be able to have something up soon.

### **Alicia** (2011-04-30 12:47:49)

**BW**
Remove DR from listing
Did you mean PBS (for pt blank shot) and not PBR?
Grapple is essentially your highest attack total; Ranged or Melee. Ranged is highest at +9 so Grp +9.
A weapon group needs to be declared for Dev Attack and Penetrationg Attack. Pistols? They both should also be listed under Atk Options.
Skills - Initiative +11 (needs changed at top too); Gather Information +3 (may take 20)
Gungan language... I think this is a throwback to your earlier concept. With your current background, how likely is it he would be exposed to the language?
Possesions - If you wouldn't mind making indicating what items are in the holster that would be great.. IE Blaster pistol in hip holster.
Give me a heads up after you make the changes for a final check and you can put it up.

**jaybee**
Remove stat block from spoiler. When you make the final post you can remove the Faction part and get rid of the lines so the statblock is flush under your character's name.
Please include text formatting in the stat block. My advice: Start over using the post model. You are missing your FP and DP fields, which is where eyou will also declare your Background.
Skills - If you're going to list primary and secondary skills, primary should be the skills you are trained in. As such you have 10 listed in your shat block when you should only have 7. You have your skills listed with the correct mod and the correct amount in your level breakdown
Devestating Attack requires a declared weapon group, which you listed with your atk options but not under the talents or in the break down.
At level 6 you have listed you took a level of Jedi. You're missing your multiclass feat of WP(lightsaber). THe AP (med) could be counted as your level 6 feat.
Edit. I'd like to add if you took a 2 level of soldier you could take AP med as your class feat opening up your level 6 feat for something else. Illusion after all is a Force talent but you wouldn't get it with what I just suggested.

### **Alicia** (2011-05-01 11:03:09)

**BW** and **JayBee**  (you need to list your credits left first) may post your sheets in the GAR character thread of the campaign forum.
**Vermillion**
One last thing, since you've listed holsters as part of your equipment, please list the holster with the item it is containing. For the concealed holster, please put where you are hiding it. See BW's sheet for an example.
You also need to list how many credits you have left to you.
After that you may post your sheet to the CIS thread in the campaign forum.
**Hayabusa**
You also need to list how many credits you have left. You should also purchase holstsers for your weapons unless you intend on holding them all the time. (holster can be a sling for a rifle or a sheath for a vibroblade.)
Then you may also post your character in the CIS thread.
The easiest way to transfer everything over is to edit your post in this thread and copy and paste it to the character thread. That way all the formatting will be kept.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-01 11:06:16)

I´ll have a new sheet up soon Alicia, though the concept has slided a bit towards "Jedi Field Commander" as opposed to "Multiattacking Jedi". Hope that´s ok.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-01 11:37:19)

OK, I made an update of the raw stats and level breakdown just so you have something to look at. The rest will follow shortly, most likely after I get something to eat.

List the WP retraining by replacing it with Skill Training(Gather Information, Use the Force) in the feats section.
Level 4 - what skill did you choose to train in? Acrobatics?
To clean it up, please put the skills in alphabetical order. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
Remove DR from listing
add

```

[b]Ranged[/b] by weapon +8 (+3)
```

You'll need your bonuses on hand for Redirect Shot.
Defend should be listed with your Defenses not as a Special Action.
Defenses Ref 20 (flat footed 17), Fort 18, Will 19; Defend
Also when you choose your armor, please make a note of what your defenses are without it.
Force Powers - please put the descriptor for the [lightsaber] powers.
Don't forget to make a notation of where the non-core abilities came from.
Attack Combo (melee) is an Atk Option
Don't forget to list your attacks out for Dual Wpn Mastery.
As a side note so we're on the same page. When using Defend/Redirect Shot: If the shot misses, you still must roll the Defend utf check vs the attack roll before you can roll your ranged atk for Redirect Shot. We will have to work out how we will want to manage this, particularly with Defend since I will once again be allowing you to roll in the posts.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-02 05:41:20)

**DA**
Sheet's looking good. Just waiting to see what armor you've chosen so I can do a final check of your Defenses.
You forgot to add in your Ranged modifiers, which you will need for Redirect Shot. I gave you a code to use in my list.

There, I´m pretty sure I got it all in now, and even got 5 Cr to spare. I think I got all the references and details in, but tell me if I need to add something.
Since I removed Redirect Shot I don´t have a ranged attack option anymore, but I suppose I could add it in if you really think it necessary. Same thing for Dual Weapon options, I just think it takes up a lot of space since I´ve got 4 options (including using two unarmed attacks at once).

I hope you don't regret not having any credits... Not sure if you know the story of Jason's Al'verde in Tapestry.. He had 30+ grenades and barely 500 credits to his name. When it came to buying something he wanted in game he didn't have the coin to pay,

It's always good to have Ranged on there. As for DWM you don't have to worry about doing all of them, just the options you think will be used the most.
Edit: Forgot to mention it looks like you're good to go.

NP Magic, hope everything is alright there.
I'll just keep tormenting hayabusa and BW till everyone else pulls together <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

I´m not overly worried about not having a lot of money on hand. When I was in the army, "improvise" was a standard solution we had, and we´ve got McGuyver as something of an idol at my program in school.

It said "seems like", so I thought I´d double check

Btw, Alicia, I forgot to ask, but can I start with one Force Regimen completed? I´m thinking they would be something you perform every day (if possible), like a regular morning routine. I don´t know if it´ll matter, perhaps there´s nothing special going to happen in the closest 24 hours, but still. Also, can I somehow just assume that the stuff needed for Vo'ren´s Second Cadence is available, even though I didn´t mention 72 Wax Cylinders/2701 Ball Bearings (wtf is that anyway?) on my sheet? Otherwise I might want to change it to another regimen... <!-- s:)) -->![:))](https://i.ibb.co/ZRrbtNtj/icon-razz.gif)<!-- s:)) -->

Plausibly you'll have needed time to fulfill the requirements and for the cadence it will need to be available whether you take the supplies or they are accessible.

ball bearings are metal spheres that vary in size. From BBs to basketballs. They're used in anything metal that rotates, and normally you can't see em. They commonly go out in vehicles, where they are located in the hub, between the rotor and axle.

Thanks, I realize what they are now, just didn´t know the english word was "ball bearing". Still think the numbers seems to be a bit off though...

Remove DR. It's a standard action and a FP to activate so is not always active.
Go through and remove *. Keep only those your are going to mark with a note at the end of your stat sheet.
Negate energy does not need to be listed with your defenses, though you may want to include Equilibrium. Up to you, it works where it is under Special Options
Mark which powers have [lightsaber] descriptor.
I'm trying to decide if Max Dex on the armor is going to be still held. The Max Dex was supposed to represent the restriction in movement one would have in the armor so I'm leaning toward making it a Max bonus to Reflex (meaning only up to +3 can be added to Reflexes regardless of ability).
Everything else adds up, just make sure you've made the adjustments from my first post.

In one of the short story compilations a sith teaches a Jedi that practice, it wasn't called Voren anything though i think. they described it as happening in an amphitheater, Greek or Roman style. doesn't make sense for the big one to be doable at all on the road but it don't really matter. in the exercise she had to do a spinning twirling dance, never stopping, destroying each ball bearing, with out melting any of the wax columns. that story was amazing, and the Sith in it, the Master, is kinda my basis for Etude, a Sith master I use alot. The one in the story is an actor by profession. I believe it was Tales from the New Republic though im not sure.
and in the story, the Master had the girl increase in difficulty too. the 70-something was the last.

Looks good Magic, though remove Negate Energy as a special option and you should probably list Bellow as a special quality.
Still wondering what the purpose of the remaining * are for.
You can now add yours to the thread and can even take a stab at posting your intro if you want.
