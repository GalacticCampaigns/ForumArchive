Bartyn's Landing. Planet Lamaredd. Lamaro system. Era Old Republic. Year and 6 months after the end of the Mandalorain Wars.
Bartyn's Landing was founded by Hugo Bartyn a field surveyor for ORO (Outer Rim Oreworks) had found a treasure trove of mineral wealth. He also found out another of the planets great resources. It's vast salt oceans are a teaming with life. He retired to be the Administrator of the ORO mining operations and was given a large area of the main land mass for himself. After he had cleaned and ran off the local beings that call this planet home he created Bartyn's Landing. He brought in a Hoersch -Kessel LH 3010 Capital freighter with the help of the contact and "borrowed" landed next to the shore. Creating a ready made city. He also tricked aquatic races into coming to the planet for work and a better life. When they arrived on the planet reality hit them. They became little more then slaves.
It has been 500 years sense that time. His family has freed the people of Bartyn's Landing and allowed them to create homes and lives for themselves. The settlement is still pretty much an Outlaw area. There is some law enforcement but it is owned by the Bartyn family. It is a time of great change and turmoil in the galaxy. Heroes and Villains are everywhere and a great darkness may be coming soon.
