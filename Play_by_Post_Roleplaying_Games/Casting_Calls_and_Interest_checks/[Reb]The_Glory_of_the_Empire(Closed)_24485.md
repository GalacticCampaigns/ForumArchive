# [Reb]The Glory of the Empire(Closed)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The Glory of the Empire**</span>
*Nearly two decades have passed since the rise of the Empire and the fall of the Old Repulic and its Jedi guardians. Emperor Palpatine rules the Galaxy with an iron first, and at his side serves Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith. Imperial rule stretches across most of the Galaxy, keeping the peace and stability intact, and its white-armored stormtroopers are found everywhere. These brave warriors have taken it upon themselves to defend the Empire against deluded rebels, or aggressive non-humans. Only the finest among the Imperial ranks are allowed to join their ranks, and they are the elite of the elite, and feared across the Galaxy…*
Taking place a few years before the Battle of Yavin, this campaign is meant to place the players in the roles of one of the Empire´s infinite stormtrooper squads. It will take place before the Declaration of Rebellion, and so, your early missions might consist of fighting pirate gangs, or quell local rebellions by various oppressed non-human species. There will be an emphasis on using tactics and working together to succeed, and hopefully you can become a bit more impressive than the stormtroopers we see in movies and games;)
I feel it is necessary to point out specifically that this is **not** a commando-style game a la *Republic Commando*. You are meant to get the experience of the frontline soldiers, "grunts" if you will, and of being part of a larger army. Given the numerous opportunities for advancements in the vast Stormtroopers Corps, you will eventually be able to specialize into any kind of unit you want, including but not limited to: Scout Troopers, EVO Troopers, Jumptroopers, Storm Commandos, and Shock Troopers.
<strong>Character Creation</strong>
**Species** - Given the Imperial view of non-human species, all characters must be human. If you want to have the role of a clone stormtrooper, you may use the species stats for humans, for the sake of fairness (and also because the clone template don´t fit the requirements below)
**Classes** - All classes will be allowed, but given the nature of the game, Soldier and Scout levels will probably be the most useful, and starting out in Soldier is recommended. And yes, this does include the Jedi class, but I will expect a very well-written and plausible background to allow that.
**Ability Scores** - Characters are created using a 30 point buy
**Starting Level** - Characters starts out at 3rd level (the exception is Mag, who can keep his 4th level character, who will also be acting commander of the squad)
**Equipment** - To keep it simple, don´t bother. Equipment in this game will be handled mainly using the Gear Requisition system from Galaxy at War, and as such handed out prior to each mission. You should be prepared to manage and maintain your equipment layout though, as I will be enforcing rules of Encumbrance and rules for reaching items stored in backpacks and so on.
**Background** - We will be using Backgrounds instead of Destinies in this game. If you don´t have the Rebellion Era sourcebook, just talk to me and we can work something out.
**The Force** - While I don´t ban Force sensitive characters, there is a lot of consideration that should go into submitting such a character. For example, why is he serving in the stormtroopers corps rather than being taken to any of the many orders of Dark Adepts in the Empire? Has he managed to hide his presence from those that would sense it? And if he has, how will he react if they want to draft him off into one of the aforementioned orders?
**Requirements** - Characters are free to be created with whatever abilities they want to, but there are a few minimum requirements. These are takesn directly from Galaxy at War, and are listed as the minimum requirements to become a stormtrooper.
Str 12, Dex 11, Con 11, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 10, Armor Proficiency(Light), Weapon Proficiency(Simple, Pistols, Rifles), Weapon Focus(Rifles), Trained in Endurance
I would hope to obtain at least 4 players for this game. I will run the game as a squad of 8, but depending on the number of players, we may work out some solution where you run multiple characters or something. But that discussion can be taken when we see how many people are interested.
I will be expecting a posting rate of 1 post every 2-3 days, and will do my very best to follow this myself. Allowances will be made for real-life things of course, but I do ask that you try and tell me beforehand if you´re going away or something.
That´s all from the top of my head, but if you have any questions, post them here, or send me a PM.

Now this is interesting. Life from the stormie point of view, eh? I'm definitely in! I'm thinking of trying a sort of sniper-type scout character, assuming that's ok with you, Thrax? I do have one question, given we start with no credits, does that mean the equipment you listed is our only starting equipment? 'Cause I'd kind of like to have a vibrodagger or something just in case. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
Oh yeah, and I don't have the Galaxy at War book, so could you give me some idea what the Sidearm Blaster Pistol is?

---

## Re: The Glory of the Empire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-11-11 11:21:34)

Yes, the equipment you start with is the only equipment you get, drawn directly from standard stormtrooper issue equipment. For melee I suggest using your fists, and I consider Combat Gloves to be included when you wear any kind of armor with gloves.
The sidearm blaster pistol is just like a regular blaster pistol, except that is gets 250 shots out of each power pack. The drawback (and reason for the high ammo), is that whenever you use the Rapid Shot feat, or any feat that has it as a prerequisite, you must spend a Swift action to reset the weapons trigger before being able to fire again.

Okay, thanks. Here's a rough draft for a character, let me know what needs changing or fixing. Also, just out of curiosity, how long after Order 66 is this?

**Special Actions** Acute Senses, Careful Shot

**Abilities** Str 12, Dex 16, Con 13, Int 14, Wis 11, Cha 10
**Special Qualities** Shake It Off
**Talents** Evasion, Acute Senses
**Feats** Shake It Off, Weapon Proficiency (pistols, rifles, simple), Armor Proficiency (light), Weapon Focus (rifles), Point Blank Shot, Careful Shot
**Skills** Endurance +7, Initiative +9, Knowledge (tactics, technology) +8, Mechanics +8, Perception +6, Stealth +9, Survival +6
**Possessions** BlasTech E-11 Blaster Rifle (Standard Blaster Rifle w Retractable Stock), Stormtrooper Armor (built-in helmet package and combat gloves), Sidearm Blaster Pistol, Utility Belt (rations [3 days], medpac, tool kit, power pack, energy cell, glow rod, comlink, liquid cable dispenser w/ grappling hook, frag grenade), credits 0
**Backstory** Marcus was born into riches, meaning that practically from birth he was a spoiled brat who got anything he asked for. That's why it was so devastating to him when his father died. Marcus didn't know this at the time, but his father was a prominent crime lord, and every credit he had came from stealing, cheating, lying, and much worse. One day he crossed a few too many lines and didn't quite cover his tracks well enough. The result was a Jedi Knight banging down his door and placing him under arrest. But Marcus's father was never one to go quietly. He opened fire at the Jedi, thinking he could catch him off guard. He was wrong. One of the shots he fired was deflected right back at him, hitting him in the heart. He was dead instantly. And Marcus had been watching the whole thing from a hidden room.
Marcus was still fairly young, and didn't understand why the Jedi had, from his point of view, shot and killed his father. He ran, managing to use what money he had on him to buy passage off the planet and to some distant relatives on Coruscant. He vowed revenge on the Jedi, and began teaching himself how to fire a blaster, and other skills he thought he might need. He changed his last name to help himself remain inconspicuous, and cut all ties he had remaining to his father's “company.”
Then Order 66 came. The Jedi were all but wiped from existence by the ruthless army of the new Galactic Empire. Marcus was overjoyed, and immediately applied to the Imperial Academy, hoping that he might be able to help mop up some of the last of the Jedi.
**Appearance** Marcus has green eyes and brown hair cut short to the Imperial standards. He's very average, not being particularly tall or muscular or otherwise outstanding. The most noticeable thing about him is the star-shaped mark on his left shoulder, which he burned into himself “to remind himself of the pain of losing his father.”

Seems good, but your Reflex Defense is 3 points high. You do not get your heroic level bonus when wearing armor. Also, don´t forget that stormtrooper armor includes a helmet package, and as a houserule of mine, combat gloves.
The campaign will start some years before the Battle of Yavin, so perhaps 16-17 years after Order 66. I really hate keeping track of such things though, so this is very approximate. If I deem it fit that Yavin takes places after only a few weeks, then it will.

I admit to being intrigued, but my question is on those that take the Noble class and the wealth talent. Can some one take three levels in Noble? If you allow the wealth talent, does the credits simply roll over?

The Noble class is fine and allowed, as long as you meet the given requirements for a stormtrooper. I actually hadn´t given too much thought on the wealth talent, but I guess I should have, since it is quite popular. But my reasoning is that in the military, money is not a big issue, as you tend to get everything you need commissioned to you, and if you need anything more, you can request it. So any personal wealth you accumulates would be purely personal, and you would still be expected to use the military-issue equipment. At least from scratch, since the characters are supposed to be basic recruits withing the stormtrooper corps. Overall, I planned to have money be a very small issue in this campaign, so perhaps I should say that Wealth should be disallowed.
But what did you have in mind?

You´ll be serving in one of the Empire´s many stormtrooper legions, being dispatched where you need to be in order to perform your missions. My idea was that you will be on duty most of the time, and that any downtime between missions are left out a lot. But yes, you will be facing different missions (although they will involve combat), ranging from taking out pirate bases, to acting as escorts, to partaking in full-scale invasions.

Backstory : Eldred used to live on the fringe near the outer rim, he was barely out of his teen when the galactic republic left place to the empire. In need of an education, he left for one of the new imperial academy to try and join the navy, instead he was recruited into the stormtroopers.
For as long as he can remember, Eldred has been rather lucky, capable of somehow avoiding making bad decision and a gut feeling from time to time warning him of danger. Nothing major and certainly nothing that would reveal his force potential to anyone not actively looking for it. This is what allowed him to avoid detection by the empire since he has always attributed such feelings to luck and generaly avoid talking about it.
Eldred has grown up watching holovids of the clone war and was shocked when the jedi where revealed to be traitors, yet he was also very proud of his childhood hero, Anakin Skywalker when he was shown to be in service of the empire.
Eldred has no illusion that he could ever rise to the power and dedication of the now renamed Darth Vader, instead he aims to prove his loyalty to the empire and be as good a citizen as he can.
Appearance : Eldred stand a bit taller than average, but not so much that he really jump out of a growd. His light grey eyes aare among the most distinguishing feature he possess and lend him a certain intensity of gaze.
Side note : I wouldn't mind having him involved with the Inquisitor or other organisation of the same type. But if not, he'll just stay a soldier with good instinct.

Seems like an interesting character. You can go ahead and raise your Base Attack to +2, I run with fractions. For you as well, don´t forget stormtrooper armor has a helmet package installed.

Is there room for us to specialise? I'd like to do a scout trooper character, though that would require slightly different gear.

## Re: The Glory of the Empire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-11-15 18:52:02)

Not from scratch, there isn´t. Normally I don´t like to make such restrictions on characters, but because of the setting I chose, I think it is fitting. Still, you have all the variety in the game to make your character the way you want, it´s pretty much only the gear that is static, as well as the requirements for the Stormtrooper Corps.
Later in the campaign, there will be opportunities for all of you to specialize, join the various branches of the stormtrooper organization, or even other branches of the Imperial military.
Also, if it is gear you are worried about, I want everyone to use the same gear, since as far as I know, most regular, organized military forces has all their troops use the same standard issue equipment. But there is always the possibility of looting of course. If it is a sniper rifle you want, perhaps taking one from that enemy sniper you just killed can assist you in your mission. Although you´ll probably lose it before your next mission.

Seems good, but a few things to point at:

* You should have one more trained skill.
* The Stormtrooper armor contains a Helmet Package, giving you +2 Perception, Low-Light Vision and an integrated comlink.
* If you don´t have the books available, perhaps you don´t know what the Natural Leader feat does. If you do, I´d be very interested in hearing about your organization. It feels like one of those feats that I never expected anyone to take.
* I´d be wanting a background, of course

Yes I totally confused natural leader feat with born leader talent. I looked it over and while it sounds like a cool feat to have, its not my own group its the all powerful Emperor Palpatine whom I live to serve.

ok if you say so. Short background of Sharez Jek.
"Good afternoon cadet Jek," Sgt. Jensen ran ahand along the stubble of the troopers freshly shorn head, of the new recruit. "what made you want to become a stormtrooper boy."
"Sir, they are the best of the best, and that is what I have always wanted to be."
Jensen grinned. "So you aren't the best boy? That's a shame because that is what we accept."
"Sir, if you look at my transcript you will see the highest of marks. I have recieved 2 Cody's in marksmanship."
"It also says your MOS is command. To be a stormtrooper you have to know when to follow."
He paused a moment to have a sip of his soykaf. "Do you know when to follow?"
"Yes sir," Jek answered with a quaver in his voice.
"You faltered there aminute boy, what are you thinking."
"It is personal sir." Jek answered. "It now way affects my performance."
"I'm afraid it does boy. You faultered for a second. A second may mean the difference between victory and the death of your squad."
"I was raised on Twith by my father and younger brother. My father enlisted when the empire first opened ranks to non-clones. He would always be gone performing our duties and I was left home in charge. Most of my teen years I was both mother and father to my brother. It was just a year ago that we recieved a letter bearing the emperors seal saying that my father had fallen in the line of duty putting down an insurgence on Kashyyk. The letter said that a wookie had pulled him apart. His helmet was sent back to us along with a Palpatine Star that was awarded posthumously. We were granted full scholarships through the Imperial acadamy. I leapt at the chance. I wanted to be as good a trooper as my father. My brother, who was only 16 standard years, was not ready to enlist but old enough to care for himself until he could.

"So you regret joining the Imperial Legions?"
"Quite the contrary sir," Jek snapped a perfect salute. "I wish to serve the Empire as bravely as my father, I wish to be the best I can be in the Imperial Stormtrooper Corp. I intend to grow within the ranks and lead young men like me and my brother to shape an orderly Empire, designed in the Emperor's image."
Jensen pressed a few buttons on his datapad and met eyes with the cadet. "I will deliver my report to my superiors as well as yours. Once you graduate from the academy I will look forward to see you among our ranks."
Jensen stood and saluted the young cadet, he snapped one back at lightning speed.
"Thank you sir," Jek suppressed his urge to smile.
"Don't thank me boy. Thank Emperor Palpatine."

Hm... I think I may need to scrap my current character. I'm not really feeling him. Here's a question for you Thrax, if I were to register as a Force-Sensitive, would it be possible for me to ultimately end up as a Dark Jedi complete with lightsaber by the end of the campaign? Obviously, I have no delusions about starting there, but it would be an interesting ultimate goal to work towards. In the mean time, a soldier/scout just learning about and developing his Force powers seems like an interesting character to play.

Underneath his armour Beksus has the appearance of a young human, short brown hair with matching eyes, at about 23 years old he was born on Coruscant and fell in with the wrong crowd at a young age. His parents would have been furious had they found out, but they dissapeared soon after the birth of the new order, imperial agents told the boy his parents were killed by fleeing jedi to which he responded by enlisting in the imperial army.
Before this happened Beks was studying mechanics by day and using it to illegaly modify speederbikes by night, he had one of the fastest bikes on the planet and the piloting skill to put it to full use, though the bike's now growing dusty in a garage deep in the lower city.
Beks is hotheaded and so far has had issues following orders from his superiors, leading them to maintain a closer eye on him than they'd like. The truth is that he really just wants to exact some kind of vengeance for the loss of his parents, though he enjoys the access to military hardware the job brings.

**Backstory:** Born on a world in the Mid-Rim, Alex came at what most people would consider to be a bad time nowadays. The Clone Wars were three years away, the late night news reporting just speculations and rhetoric on the motivations of one group or another. That was the case until Geonosis, when the veil of deciet fell away. Seperatist Forces launched an invasion of his home not soon after, his mother killed when the bombs come in, his father missing in the resulting chaos when he had to send his son away on an overloaded transport.
Being packed on a refugee transport and sent to a relocation camp for two years hardened him alittle, but the droids came again and he was drafted as a guide, scout, and mechanic. It wasn't until the droids had shut down that the Clone Wars ended. It was quickly taken other by another war, this time by the vultures, which taught him how to move and shoot, where he came a better shot with a rifle, where he went under the wing of several Clone War veterans that went either mercenary, to revel in the war they never left, or missionary, to help those escape it.
It was with the veterans that finally help Kirnos realize that while they were helping him, the Empire could bring the necessary order that help prevent what happened to him and his family. With this and a recommendation by the veterans, Kirnos was able to enroll into the Imperial Stormtrooper Academy on Carida, learning the inticracies of the armor that was denied in his earlier years and was able to further hone his skills with the rifles that he was always familiar with.****

Sorry, I know it's pretty lame that I said I'd do it that night and then totally didn't. The next few days ended up being busier than I thought they'd be. I'll post him now, hope the concept of a stormtrooper who specializes in hand-to-hand combat isn't too oddball. (If it is, I can always go with my other concept of a Jumptrooper, though he'd be a little less useful until he actually got a jetpack, thus why I went with this one)
By the way, I noticed you saying you'd use the Rebellion Era book, but I didn't see anyone ask this: Would you be willing to let someone use the optional Backgrounds (pages 16-22) instead of having a Destiny? If so, that would definitely change my character writeup. Anyway, here he is.

**Description:** Kirt is a man who looks to be in his late 20's, tall, very well-muscled, with brown hair, and brown eyes that seem to be perpetually glaring. He has an impressive collection of scars, each with a story to it that Kirt is not bloody likely to tell you, and if you ask he'll affix you with an inscrutable but distinctly cantankerous stare, and a firm grunt, or possibly even a low growl if he feels especially one way or another on the subject. He's a very serious sort of guy, very rarely cracking a smile, and almost never at anything anyone else would smile at, unless someone who likes disemboweled wookiees happens to be present, which, considering the Imperial view of non-humans, isn't really that far-fetched. Kirt likes to keep things simple and to the point, and is not afraid to knock someone's teeth out to do it.
He is capable enough with a blaster rifle, as are all Stormtroopers, and in most cases he'd probably just use that. Hand-to-hand combat, however, is where he really shines. Growing up with wookiees gave him a fair amount of practice with it, and the Empire has only refined this through formal training, and exposure to martial arts like Echani, though he's advanced his training in this type of combat far beyond what a typical Stormtrooper would. It serves him well in close quarters, and in situations that wouldn't call for him to waste the energy in his power pack.
**Backstory:** Kirt Valraad was born on a barely-running B-7 light freighter called the *King's Ransom*, to a pair of escaped slaves, Hutch Valraad and Danna Nodin. The two of them belonged to a Hutt, and served him in his rather dingy little 'palace' on a little-known planet somewhere in the Outer Rim, where they fell in love, and eventually shared a bed (this is a figure of speech; neither of them slept in an actual bed). When Danna was discovered to be pregnant, the couple decided they wanted to give their child a better life than the one they had. After a few months of planning, they made their escape, and stowed away on a freighter leaving the planet. They hopped a few more freighters, hoping to get to the Core Worlds, and eventually stowed away on the *King's Ransom*, where Danna went into labor during the voyage. Unfortunately, the freighter's medical facilities were sub-par to say the least, and she was already quite weak from malnutrition. Danna died in childbirth, living only long enough to name their baby Kirt, after her father.
Grief-stricken, Hutch turned to alcohol for the next few years to ease the pain of losing Danna. He traveled the galaxy with his son, but the experience did little to comfort him, and he found that there was more solace in a bottle of juma juice than in the assorted wonders of any of the planets he'd visited. But that would all change one fateful day, when Hutch ran into a man who said he could see the despair in Hutch's eyes. He said he was a member of something called the Church of the One Sun, and had the answer to all of his problems. He told him the beliefs of his organization, that all the suns of all the systems in the galaxy were just different facets of one sun-god who controlled the course of the entire universe by way of the suns' rays. At least partially due to his drunken stupor, Hutch was more receptive to this than another sane person might have been, and after a great deal more discussion, he was converted.
The cult itself was a bit zany, perhaps, but Hutch seemed to find new purpose. He cleaned up his act, gave up his addiction to alcohol, and scrounged up enough money to buy his own ship. By chance, though he called it providence, he came across the *King's Ransom* again, up for sale and possibly even in worse condition than it was when he'd last seen it, if such a thing were possible. With the ship his now 4-year-old son had been born in, he flew across the galaxy with renewed vigor, feeling guided to be a missionary and spread the glorious truth of the One Sun to other planets. Eventually, he settled on the wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk. He spent the next several years preaching to the wookiees, living with Kirt in the *Ransom* as he couldn't exactly afford a house. The wookiees were not especially receptive, regarding him as little more than a curiosity, but for the most part they respected his beliefs and tolerated his presence.
As Kirt grew, he came to resent his father, not sharing his beliefs and not appreciating getting dragged to Kashyyyk for them. Even more than he disliked his father, though, he despised the wookiees. "Walking carpets" he called them, sometimes even to their faces, which they did not take kindly to, and thus Kirt quickly learned all the finer points of hand-to-hand combat. He found a certain enjoyment in fighting the wookiees, even though he almost always lost. His physical injuries never stopped him from picking fights, and his father's chiding only served to annoy him. Kirt would limp out to the treetops with black eyes and bruises, and find creative new ways to insult the young wookiees passing by until at least one of them responded. It proved to be very educational, and by the time he was a teenager, he could hold his own against most ordinary wookiees of a similar age. By then, the wookiees in that area had learned to leave him alone, and he had more or less worn out their welcome.
It was also around this time that Kashyyyk joined the Clone Wars, and the Separatists invaded. Kirt and his father moved near the coastal city of Kachirho, the site of the battle. Hutch was hoping to take advantage of the uncertainty of war to convert people to the faith. He found little success, but Kirt was relieved to see some humans for a change, even if they were clones. He was enamored with the clone troopers, and secretly wished he could be one of them, a wish that would stay with him and ultimately change his life forever. But one more big change was to come. The battle came and went, and it seemed business would continue as usual for the Valraads, until Hutch came home one day and made a very special announcement. He had been out walking that morning, and found a baby wookiee, unattended, apparently with no mother or father. He theorized that the baby must have found itself orphaned by the war, or perhaps separated from his parents in the evacuation of the city. He said it had to be providence, and told Kirt he had decided to adopt the wookiee, who would be Kirt's baby brother.
Kirt was absolutely appalled. All the anger he felt toward his father came to a head as he tried to process this new development. It was bad enough that he had to live on Kashyyyk among the wookiees, had to endure his father's wacky superstitious nonsense, but now he was supposed to accept one of these filthy walking carpets as family! It was the straw that broke the bantha's back, only this was less of a straw and more of a boulder. Kirt made his objections known, and his father firmly disagreed with his views. As the argument became more heated, Kirt finally flew into an indignant rage and attacked his father, putting his hands around his neck and squeezing. Had he not stopped himself, he would have strangled his father to death. As it was, he only left him wheezing and spluttering on the floor. Kirt gathered a few essential things and left the little freighter, and Kachirho, never to return.
In his late teens at this point, Kirt wandered the planet, doing whatever odd jobs he could get to survive, frequently as a guide or a translator for off-worlders. As the Empire came to power, and the wookiees were subdued, Kirt seemed to have found his calling in hunting down fugitive wookiee slaves, a job he quite enjoyed, and one he held well into his adulthood. As the Imperial presence on Kashyyyk increased, Kirt helped them however he could, and when the Stormtrooper Corps began accepting non-clone recruits, he joined at the first opportunity, jumping at the chance to get off of Kashyyyk and fulfill his childhood dream.

I actually hadn´t thought about it that much, but the more I think about it, if you guys had backgrounds, it would make more sense. I may have a hard time figuring out good destinies for you all, since you´re working as a team, and there´s really little room for individual goals.
That said, if anyone wants to use Backgrounds, that´s fine. Perhaps that can add in some skill diversity among the mainly Soldier/Scout levels you´ve got. Anyone who wants a Destiny can have it of course, but I would actually prefer it if as many of you as possible would use a Background. Sorry for not thinking that through earlier.

OK, I´ve been going through all the applications, and found some things that are incorrect (see below), but otherwise everything looks fine. I counted up to 8 applications, and while I´m a little worried about that large a group, but in the controlled environment of the military, it might be doable. Besides, it makes a full squad, without NPCs.
Thus, I´ve decided not to include any NPCs in your groups, and accept all applied characters. As such, I will give one of you the rank of Sergeant, and one will receive the rank of Corporal. This is assuming you are all still game of course. I would also like everyone to give their characters a number designation of the format RS-XXXX except Parmenter, whose designation code is of the format TC-XXXX.
**Zen** - Blaster Rifle attacks should be at +6. Grapple should be +6
**Berior** - Unarmed should be +4 (1d4+3). Grapple should be +4. And if you could list only skills you are trained in, I´d appreciate it.
**Avarna** - Perception should be +7(+9), Endurance should be +7
**Henraldo** - Please add your DPs, FPs, and if you´d like a Dark Side Score. your Unarmed damage should be 1d4+3
**Tempeste** - Add your DPs and FPs. Also please list which skill Skill Training is for. And also please just list your trained skills.
**Parmenter** - Unarmed damage should be 1d4+4
**Grendy** - Reflex Defense should be 20 (17 flat-footed). Pistol attack should be at +4. You should also have one more trained skill.
I´ll ask Alicia for a game forum, and you can post your characters there when you´ve changed these things. I hope everyone is still up for play, you´ll get until Sunday to make your posts and show you´re game, because then we´ll start <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->

Nothing that I could find. For most people it was a case of not having noticed that I said Combat Gloves were part of the stormtrooper armor. Which is understandable, since it was just a comment I put somewhere.

Okay, understandable. Do you have the Galaxy at War book btw? Since you were the one to receive a rank that can have some benefits, it might be useful.

Right now we have demolition expert and pilot (Tempeste), a "heavy" weapons expert (Parmeter), a back up medic (Green Dice), and a rifleman (Saronian). We can use a dedicated medic and a combat multiplier which can really help us out, subject to what Darth has posted for in the guidelines.

Post up a guy. Right now we have three slots available right off the bat (Medic, Heavy Weapons Expert, and Rifleman) and can always use another person in the wings incase someone falls out.
Just wondering, though, what would you feel comfortable playing, subject to Darth's current criteria?

Just to clarify that, you don´t necessarily have to make a character to fill one of those roles if you don´t want to. I´ve just filled out the empty slots in the squad with NPCs that can be described in that way.
If you´re interested, post a character. There´ll probably be made room for you pretty quickly, either be me removing an NPC, or an inactive player.

From my perspective, nice background and such. Are you planning on taking levels in noble later on?
The only problem is that you will need to drop one feat for Weapon Focus (Rifles), unless Darth says otherwise.

Didn't really have any plans of Noble'ing. Is there something that I missed about noble? And I had missed that weapon focus requirement, but I'll fix it right away. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Oh, you didn't miss anything about it. Just from your background you character went into college/medical school. Background wise, it makes since to put a level in Noble. Howver, that's just back ground.
As for weapon focus, that's entirely up to Darth, but in the beginning it was a requirement for us to take. Again, it'll be up to him.
If you want, you can also critique mine, that way this won't be a one way street.

Well, it took me a bit longer than expected, but I´ve been waiting to hear back from two of the players but haven´t gotten any response, so in all likelihood, you´ll be taking one of their spots.
Now, for the character

* I count 1 language too many. You should have Basic+Int modifier
* You should have 53 Hit Points
* Grapple should be +5

Other than that I can see no errors. I´ll come back to you when I find some way to put you in the game. And I´ll try to make it happen before next week.

Mal grew up on the mean streets of Corellia. He ran with swoop gangs and basically did what ever he needed to survive. One night he got wrapped up in something he shouldn't have. He witnessed a Black sun execution. He knew if he was discovered he would be next. He joined the stormtrooper corps the next day figuring he would hide in the see of stormtroopers scattered across the galaxy. He actually enjoyed the training and discipline that was instilled in him during basic training and beyond. He has hopes to join the Storm Commandoes as soon as he is able.

Looking good Frost, a few things though.

* You only get one class skill from your background, not three.
* Please only list skills you are trained in, it gets so messy otherwise.
* You should have a Grapple modifier of +4.

I´ve really been neglecting this game lately <!-- s:red: -->![:red:](https://i.ibb.co/xStHX79F/icon-redface.gif)<!-- s:red: --> due to a hectic period, but I´m going to shape up. I can´t give you any specifics on when we might have an opening for you, but I´ll let you know.

Back Story: Gent grew up on the streets of Nar Shadaa. He etched out what life he could amongst the criminals and other unsavory characters that ran the show. He learned how to keep out of sight when he needed to, and realized that stealing must not be so bad when you are doing it to preserve your own life. As time passed, he learned how to bypass locks and security measures to better insure his survival. He became pretty good at what he did, but he grew to despise the chaos of such a place as Nar Shadaa. He began to grow more bold and started stealing more than he needed to survive. He was hoping to gain enough to buy passage off of this aweful world.
Eventually, he managed to buy passage offworld. It was then when he first heard the doctrines of the Empire. They sought to bring order to the galaxy. To bring peace. He realized that places such as Nar Shadaa would not desire such order and peace because they would lose their power. He understood why the Empire was forced to subdue some worlds – the people were rebellious. They would never willingly submit their power in order to help bring order to the galaxy. He realized that he needed to help. He sought to enlist in the Empire in order to further their goals.
Here's my proposed character. Disclaimer: I will be out of internet from roughly Sept. 6-11.
Let me know if I need to make any changes.

So Im kind of interested in this one, it being a lwer level starting point. Other than running a few scenerios for my son and niece, Ive never actually had to play the game.
A little patience and advice from everone involved will be greatly appreciated.
Gonna work on a character today after I go over all the prerequisites that u got posted.
Hope tha t I fit in well with this group and I will contribute as much as possible.

**Background**
Roland Taske was born about 1 year after the Empire came into being. His parents were not wealthy, nor were they politically powerful; but Roland was never left longing for anything. He learned from an early age that to do what is best for friends and family far outweighs the longings of his more selfish side. Only knowing Imperial rule has left Roland with a strong allegiance for the Empire. Roland will lay down his life for the
Empires benefit. As he grew up, his only dream was to serve the Empire. But, as time passed, Roland began to see the injustices that the Empires rule has had on people
of lower rank. Though he viewed these injustices with a heavy heart, his pride in his imperial birth could not be wavered. Roland vowed to reach a status level of which he could make a difference in the treatment of all those below him. To show everyone in the galaxy how the Empires rule is for the benefit of people.

</details>

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Appearance**
Roland stands about 2meters tall, and weighs about 80kg. Dark brown hair is cut to a standard military style, and his deep blue eyes seem to pierce ones soul as you gaze upon them. Roland is muscular, though lean muscles give him the illusion of an non-threat to most warriors. On both of his arms are tattoos of the Imperial insignia, and on his lower left jaw line is a thick scar that he got from a training accident where, after receiving the blow that caused the scar, he proceeded to put his sparing partner into a coma for a week.

It´s looking good, but there´s at least one major thing you need to look at. Well technically you don´t *have* to look at it, but not doing do will make your character far inferior to the others <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

* You have been given a 30 point buy for your characters abilities, and currently your characters only sums up to an 18 point buy. Don´t forget to add your bonuses at 4th level as well.
* You should choose a Background for your character, since I am not using Destiny in this game. If you don´t have the Rebellion Campaign Guide, I could select a background for you, but in that case you might want to add some more background info on your character so I can make a better choice.
* All your defenses are 1 points high.
* You should have a Ranged attack modifier of +5.
* You don´t have to list a CL for your character, but if you still want to, it´s always equal to your character level.
* Finally, you don´t have to list where I can find stuff in the various books. I feel confident enough in my knowledge that I only think it makes the sheet look messy.

Some of these things are rather minor (which means you´ve made a good character), but the first three things you should definitely look at.

What books do you have available?

Looking good, though you seems to have one feat too many. Also, you don´t need an entry for Destiny points since you do not have a destiny.
Also, not saying you have to change it, but more as general advice, I´m not sure how much use you will have off your Bayonet master talent. I´m not too keen on issuing bayonets to troopers, since I think Imperial tactics favors trying to stay at a distance from the enemy. I´ve also never seen any evidence that stormtrooprs used bayonets.
Finally, I would like you to use the standard sheet format for Saga Edition. You can find a post model that should make things easier if you look at the drop box beneath the "subject" line when making a new post.

**Back Story (Conspiracy)** Viktor was born into a family of wealth, dubiously acquired wealth at that, but then smuggling and people trafficking wasn't really crime was it? Or so he was at least brought up to believe. The family acted as middlemen for the various criminals that needed their 'goods' shipped to the Core Worlds without the notice of planetary customs officials. Their biggest client was a particularly egregious Hutt, who had a particular penchant for Twilek dancers. As part of an agreement with their clients, they never enquired as to what the slaves would be used for, but this never stopped Viktor's inquisitiveness, often following the shipments to their destination, holorecording everything that he saw and encountered. Much of it was just trash: old men sat in plush comfort as their new 'toys' are led in, their mouths agape; or taskmasters whipping their new 'machines' in the mines. It was a rare occurrence that he actually saw something out the ordinary, but when he did, oh was it good, often rushing back to his father and his minions so that they could best employ the blackmail. It was on one such occasion that his father gave him his first blaster, saying that he was now part of the family, but really he was just an extra pair of hands in case the situation ever turned hostile, which was a more frequent occurrence as Viktor aged.
The occasion that warranted such a significant praise was an odd one: the client was [Edited Record] one of the Hutts [/Edited Record] and Viktor discovered that he was using [Edited Record] the skin of particularly glamourous Twilek Girls[/Edited Record] as [Edited Record] dye for his mercenaries' uniforms.[/Edited Record] Naturally as one would expect from such a powerful individual, when the information was leaked to the brokers, it wasn't soon before it was traced to its source, Viktor's father.
To cut a long battle short, Viktor's father was gunned down in a hail of laser fire by [Edited Record] the Hutt's mercenaries[/Edited Record], who then sent the family a message by torching their home. Satisfied that no one from the family could have survived they left. With nothing left to lose, and his combat still yet to blossom in order to exact vengeance, Viktor offered himself to other criminal families in a bid to save his now crippled mother from them, while in their weakened state. One took him in and agreed to his terms in exchange that he would be used as a trooper in his hitsquads. To the crime lord's astonishment, Viktor flourished on the frontline, often accomplishing suicidal missions that he was sent on.
When the Empire rose to power, Families such as the one that Viktor was in which provided 'protection' to a large population were swiftly dealt with if they didn't cooperate to their new terms of tenure. In fact this is how Viktor was enlisted into the Imperium. As he was now regarded as a good luck charm to the Family, the crime lord kept him as close as possible by employing him in his personal body guard.
To cut a long battle short, where Viktor gunned down a platoon of troopers before his master was executed and he was stunned and taken captive, he was subsequently recruited into the StormTrooper Corps for the tactics he employeed during the siege and his prowess in executing them.

## Re: [Reb]The Glory of the Empire(Open)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-25 11:48:09)

Looks good, but I found a few errors in the stats:

* Your HP should be 56, not 51
* I think you should have 1 more feat

Other than that though, I have a few questions and wonderings:

* Where are you getting darkvision from? The Helmet Package in the stormtrooper armor only grants low-light vision.
* From dissecting your stats, I´m guessing you took the "Conspiracy" background. If you could note that somewhere on your sheet, that´d be great. I am curious however, as to what in your background you feel qualifies him for that background. Personally I´d say that the Criminal background seems like a better fit.
* Just out of curiosity, why did you choose the talents you did? It seems like neither offers any distinct advantage, except for small and circumstantial bonuses to attack.

You can remove all equipment from your sheet, as equipment will be handed out before each mission.

---

## Re: [Reb]The Glory of the Empire(Open)

### **jaybee3** (2011-04-25 15:57:30)

Adjusted HP
Added 1 more feat (Co-Ordinated Attack)
No idea, it just appeared with low-light when I added my equipment on the stat sheet. Adjusted
Basically what I was gonna go for was that all the "Edited Records" were the Imperials editing Victor's resumé, in order to cover the tracks of the real conspiracy. Gaining acceptance into the Storm Trooper Corps is step 1 of Viktor's plan at revenge against the conspiracy they covered up. It's not general knowledge who he is, only a select few think him other than an ex-merc and know his true motives. They've allowed him into the Corps to keep him under check, thinking that he'll eventually slip up and they can dispatch him with minimal repercussions.
Misread one of them, I was thought it was when two squad members were adjacent to me. I was trying to choose squad type talents, that would potentially benefit the squad rather than just me. Adjusted (Combined Fire and Devastating Attack(Rifles))

---

## Re: [Reb]The Glory of the Empire(Open)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-25 16:20:55)

Uhm, ok...I´m a bit confused here...
So the "real" conspiracy is what? And who are "they"? For story purposes and so on, I´m going to want the whole story. It´s just that at the moment I don´t feel that what is described in your background is enough to warrant the Conspiracy background, ad would recommend that you use the Criminal background instead.
If you are looking for talents that benefits your entire squad, the "Trooper" talent tree from the Clone Wars book might be something for the future.

## Re: [Reb]The Glory of the Empire(Open)

### **jaybee3** (2011-04-25 19:30:43)

Right, so:
Basically a Moff or similar senior ranking official in the Imperial Army had been gathering a large amount of troops. The slave shipments weren't the usual weak individuals that they were used to seeing on their shipments, they were disciplined, physically fit individuals who didn't seem to bear the burden of servitude. What Victor saw was them being weaponised and going through training exercises all emblazoned with a similar symbol, that he'd never seen any Imperials wear before.
What Victor didn't know is that these troops had been spotted hitting various Imperial positions around the planet. What he didn't know was if this was a bid to try and raise waning Imperial support in the sector of if it this Moff making a stand himself.

---

## Re: [Reb]The Glory of the Empire(Open)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-26 07:41:05)

Okay, thanks, I think I see now.
I still have some trouble seeing it really qualify for a conspiracy though. If you say he doesn´t know that those troops have been hitting Imperial targets, and you say he doesn´t know if this is a Moff trying to make a stand for himself, then it seems to me like basically he has seen someone amassing and arming a lot of troops. Also, as it sounds like this is an event localized to a single planet, it just seems too...small...to be a conspiracy.
It´s not that it´s not ok for you to have the Conspiracy background, it´s just that I´m trying to get a better understanding of what you´re going for, and trying to determine if it really qualifies as a Conspiracy or not. Also, I have trouble with the plausibility of what you said about him being allowed to join the Stormtrooper Corps hoping that he´ll slip up and they can get rid of him with minimal repercussions.

## Re: [Reb]The Glory of the Empire(Open)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-10 17:03:06)

As it seems like we´re getting a third interested party, I think we can manage to get this going again. Assuming that Mag and Jaybee are still interested, of course. In that case, I´d like to raise some questions about how we should organize the game, and I have a few different ideas.

* We run like we did before, with me running all NPC troopers. Really not preferred unless we get a lot more participants, as it was pretty taxing before.
* Assuming 3 players, I control 2 NPCs, and each of you get one trooper that you can control using something similar to the droid protocol rules from the *Scavenger´s Guide to Droids*. These troopers can either be generic troopers or more special-tailored ones. One advantage of this is that it would be simple to insert new players by simply removing one of your generic troopers and replace it with a new PC.
* I could add only a single NPC, and have the squad leader control 4 NPCs as a squad.

I´d like to hear some input on this, which will also show me that you´re still interested.

this one makes sense if we're specializing. The squad is the hail of fire, we are the ones that set them up.

Preview: Lars Caldena was raised on Naboo. His parents where merchants that dealt primarily with Gungan goods. He was raised to speak their language, and learned to pilot common landspeeders and simple freighters to ensure that he always had an occupation. When he was young, his parents were murdered in a cross-fire shootout between Stormtroopers and terrorists. As he had no other relatives, he was sent to a state sponsored orphanage. When he was old enough, he was shipped off to an Imperial Army academy to relieve overcrowding at the orphanage.
Vowing revenge for his parents, Lars committed himself wholeheartedly to his studies and training. He knew he was going to do whatever it took to become a stormtrooper. He knew he would do whatever it took to protect the Empire.

OK great, I´ll PM you some stuff later, but it looks nice.
So that means we should have 3 people interested in this, and that means I am willing to try and run this. With only one person making input, I´m going to agree with Mag and say that I´ll hand you one slightly more developed NPC (run by me), and the second half of the squad will be a squad (as per the rules) of generic stormtroopers, under control of the squad leader.
Just to be clear that everyone is still interested, I want everyone to check in to this thread when they are able to go. Please check in on Sunday at the latest.

## Re: [Reb]The Glory of the Empire(Open)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-06-04 15:22:17)

Yes, there will be a thread for that. There is something half-hearted in the forums as it is, but I´ll try to make it better structured if we start up again.
Basic equipment setup varies a bit depending on assignment. If a pure combat mission is expected you might be assigned slightly heavier weaponry, more ammo, and less field gear.
