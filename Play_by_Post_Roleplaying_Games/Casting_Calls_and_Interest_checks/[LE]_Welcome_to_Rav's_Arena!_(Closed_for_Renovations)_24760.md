# [LE] Welcome to Rav's Arena! (Closed for Renovations)

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-23 23:22:50)

<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Star Wars: the Arena of Killee-Kor**</span>
</div>

The Galactic Alliance has fallen, and the Imperial Civil War rages throughout the Galaxy. While pickings are good for small organizations, Rav, pirate chieftain and owner of the Crimson Axe, has grounded himself on Socorro in the Killee Wastelands. Since ensconcing himself he has turned to bail bonds and other more semi-legitimate means to keep credits flowing and his crew happy. One of these means is the many tiers of Arenas he has started. Beginning in the slums of Killee-Kor, gladiators from all walks of life may work their way further into the city and eventually into the Crimson Axe itself. Successful gladiators gain fortune and glory, and many become feared warriors and bounty hunters in Rav's employ.
In order to advance a gladiator must bring an item to wager. The item's value is based on the gladiator's fame: a new gladiator must bring something of note, while a very successful one can wager a simple blaster whose value to collectors is immeasurable. Rav and his underlings provide cash purses to winners based on the skill levels of the combatants, and fighters may choose to participate in a variety of match types: non-lethal, death match, teams, or with the appropriate death wish, one versus many. Much of the planet and neighboring systems watch these matches, and peoples from all across the galaxy travel to Socorro to view them. Many even sponsor favored warriors, who live in the lap of luxury, so long as they remain popular.
I had thought of running a military campaign, then realized that I was playing in 2 already and that there is no real shortage of them. What I was looking for was some good old fashioned burn & bleed, rigorous exciting combat. I wanted something to give characters a chance to play in a game unlike most, in that cooperation is beneficial to survival, but not required for plot reasons. Where else can you bring that one build that you know would never work in most games? Where better to bring a group of cutthroat sociopaths than an arena? No punches pulled, and should enough PCs survive to reach the Crimson Axe and the opportunities that lie there, the game may go off planet and into other venues.
Level 1 (by the nature of the game you will level quickly)
Race and Class: Any. The Legacy Era is great for this, and an Arena will draw all kinds, even warriors like the Rakata and Yuuzan Vong, Jedi and Sith, or any other variety of Force user. Standard restrictions from races apply (no Vong Force users).
38 point buy for stats (does not include racial changes) 34 for Droids
Destiny (you'll need it)
Max HP for level (you'll need it)
credits = max starting of first level + 2000 (make sure to include a detailed breakdown of expenditures) no Mandalorian armors from KOTOR (may be available through play) droid characters may by heuristic processors for 1000 credits (not suitable for wager).
Books to use = list where the non-core talents and feats are coming from.
When you die: This is by nature an incredibly violent game, and characters will die. When it happens you may build a new character at the level of the deceased, but lose all fame acquired.
Special: you must purchase and be willing to wager an item worth 2000 credits or more for your first match (example: a heavy blaster pistol 750 with rapid recycler upgrade 500 and verpine template 1000 for a total of 2250) armors are ineligible. As the game progresses the items you wager will increase in value based on your fame: new tier = high wagers, tier you've been successful on = cheaper wagers.
Fame: will start at zero, but will be gained through matches won using a very basic organization scoring system.
Background: make it good, and if you're starting with one or more partners the backgrounds should include it.
Make notation on your character sheet of the book and page number of all non-core feats, talents, items, etc.
Due to the nature of this type of game, players may drop in or out as they feel necessary. Roleplaying may seem to not be the focus of this game, but it is a competitive game, unlike most. Bonus XP for good roleplaying may mean the difference between life and death. Skills will also be important: finding any decent side work will be incredibly difficult should you lose and need to recoup losses in order to get back into the arena.
Feel free to discuss starting as a group or becoming one later because remember: this isn't you're typical game. The GM (Me) IS trying to kill you (in the arena, anyway). That's one of the reasons you normally end up in a party anyway: having someone to out run is a good thing when bad things are chasing you.

wanna build sith knock yourselves out. i'll figure out how i'm gonna work out the DS points. vash, may wanna get with these guys: experimental sith war droid or something. i seem to remember somewhere seeing a deal where you made a UtF check to avoid gaining a DS point when using DS powers idk. For the most part, a team of Sith will have enough trouble cooperating long enough for it to matter lol. for the moment, its a non-issue. when you slaughter the paying customers in the stands then we'll talk about NPC-izing the char in question.

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Terric was found by a sith recruiter, a sith who travels the galaxy searching for force sensitive children or infants. This recruiter sensed the power in the small child and killed his parents and took the boy to Korriban to begin training. Terric grew up fast in the sith academy and while he has difficulty learning to control his use of the force he has mastered the other sith arts such as deception, treachery, and trust building. He has a natural talent for using this ability in combat using deception and misdirection as a tool even in the middle of battle. Due to his own races natural affinity with blades he has master the sith sword faster than he has a true lightsaber. His current teacher Master Etude was impressed by this and gave him a sith rapier for his reward for not getting himself slice in half during his initial assessment of Terric. Terric studies hard and practices with his lightsaber at every opportunity.
His closest allies are Kel and Zun. The three of them working together is an awesome and terrible site to behold. Kel brings the raw force power, Zun brings the muscle and Terric rounds out the group with his ruthless cunning and guile. Master Etude has often jested (at least Terric hopes he is jesting) that if he could combine the three of them he would have an unstoppable sith. After seeing a few of Etude experiments he wouldn’t be surprised if they fail this mission that he would try. Terric hopes to survive this mission so he may be chosen for training by a master, preferably Master Etude.

Abend was to be an experimental new type of battle droid. Able to think for itself and chose what the best way to complete its orders would be. Holowan Mechanicals put a lot of time and money into this droid. However as testing started the techs started to notice something about the droid. When ever they asked to repeat a test cause the droid did something wrong it would argue with them. It would say that their equipment was wrong or that it was software error. The droid would argue for hours on end until the techs would admit the droid was right. After months of searching through data logs and other resources the determined the the problem was with the Heuristic Processor. That same day the CEO wanted to put the droid out on display. In order to show the people of the galaxy their newest droid.
The techs were forced to do a quick and dirty memory wipe. After words some of the techs wished they hadn't. The droids' new personalty had a sick and twisted sense of humor. Talking about how it was going to enjoy watching humans and other organic creatures slowly freeze over and then blasting them with its main blaster, hoping to shatter an arm or leg off. That didn't matter, there was a show that needed to put on and the droid needed to be sent out to prove that they had the best droid.

Credits: 2020
Background
Zun was born into the One Sith. His parents were mere servants, but the only legacy he carries from them is his name. Shortly after his birth his Force sensitivity was identified and he was sent to the Sith Academy on Korriban. There he was raised to be fiercely loyal to Darth Krayt and his vision of a unified galaxy.
Inculcated in the dark side he was eager to prove his worth to the Sith. Zun was just a youth when the Sith openly joined the war against the Galactic Allaince but still he rejoiced. Perhaps now he would finally be able leave the academy and serve his Lord. Zun's foolish hopes were dashed however when his trainer Darth Etude informed him that he was not yet ready. Harnessing his anger Zun trained ever harder and forged himself into a truly terrifying weapon for the Sith. He rose to the top of his training class along with a Nagai named Terric Syrioc and <insert Snow's character here>. At times the rivalry between the three is vicious but a grudging respect began to grow among them as well.
Finally the end of Zun's academy training grew near. Darth Etude informed him that he would accompany Terric and <Snow> to the desert world of Sorocco. The three of them were tasked with capturing an Imperial Knight involved with the Killee-Kor arena. At the sight of a full-fledged Sith the Knight would surely flee, but a few candidates might avoid rousing his suspicions. Of course individually they would be no match for the Knight but together they could succeed. Upon successfully completing their mission they would each be assigned to their individual masters. Failure was not an option.
Zun looks forward to his mission with an almost maniacal glee. At last he can unleash his fury and prove his might to the Sith Empire.
Appearance
Standing at an impressive 2 meters height the muscle bound Zun is a fearsome sight. Red and black tattoos proclaiming his Sith allegiance adorn his body from head to toe. His yellow eyes show the taint of the dark side and glint with savage ferocity. At his side hangs a yorik coral lightsaber.

Val, how come your damage bonus with the LS is +4? if one handed it should be +3 (unless i'm missing something) two-handed it should be +6 (i seem to remember something somewhere that gave LS different damage bonuses, but i have no clue where it was).

Oh...hmm I don't remember that. I thought it was Str bonus times 1.5 (rounded down) with two hands. But maybe I'm just used to that from Pathfinder and other d20 stuff. I don't have my books but I'll check when I get home tonight.

With all melee weapons handled with two hands double strength is added into damage (p145 under Damage). This includes medium creatures using large weapons, it doesn't, however, include double sided weapons when attacking with both sides like the electrostaff.
Though if you read closely you'll see it doesn't apply to light weapons, which IIRC most lightsabers are.
It's generally a good idea to list both bonusus
IE. Lightsaber +4 (2d8+3); (2d8+6) with both hands
You can always put them on two separate lines as well...

You might want to see if anything is said about lightsabers being light weapon. I may just be confusing that from KOTOR where it says with Weapon Finesse + Weapon focus any single one-handed weapon is considered a light weapon for weapon finesse.
Edit: Did a bit more digging. Light weapons are weapons a size smaller than your size (medium creature with small weapon). So the normal lightsaber would not be a light weapon but the shoto would be. (p120)

okay Par, she looks good except for three things: the sensor package you have grants +2, so perception should be +8, and you aren't proficient with rifles (even though miniaturized its still a rifle) so the attack bonus with the rifle should be -1 or +0 with PBS. the last is your credits, you've got 650 left (i didn't see em listed is all).

okay, shazam, your droid here has issues.
to start, what chassis did you use? remember if you're gonna build a droid (except replicas) you have to use a chassis from SGtD. For example: Vash used a combat droid chassis, and i let him buy a heuristic processor for half price. you can do that too.
your reflex defense should be 17 = 10 + 2 (class bonus) +4 (dex) +1 (level), your fortitude defense should be 13= 10 +1 (class) +1 (str) +1 (level), your will defense should be 11 = 10 +1 (level).
your hit points should be 25 = 24 +1 (str)
damage threshold should be = to fort defense.
You shouldn't have any bonus to damage with the carbine, it should be 3d8, not 3d8+4.
grapple should be +4.
you haven't listed what degree your droid is (1st, 4th, etc.) which matters when it comes to stats, so I can't tell if you've bought your stats properly. I know that it isn't listed in the build guidelines, but droids only get 34 points to spend on stats instead of 38: you have one less stat to buy, it makes it unfair if you get the full amount.
I also can't be certain about your credit expenditures.
the skills mostly look good, but i can't figure out how you have perception +9. near as i can tell it should be +7, unless you're including the bonus for the multispectrum searchlight, which you shouldn't: you don't wanna run around all the time with a spotlight shining everywhere. it only works when its turned on
Your background has gotta be more than that dude, lol. Look around at some examples and work with your team to make a better one.
fix this stuff to start with we'll go from there, and if you need any help just holler.

Kel Rowan does not remember where he is from. All his life he has lived under the yoke of the Sith. He has only heard rumor and what lies can be told by his masters. He has heard whispers in secret that his people were once called the Korunnai and he was taken from them just after his birth by the Sith seers, who dreamt of his coming. He is unsure what to believe, so he has devoted his purpose in life to mastering the force; then and only then will he be able to achieve the power necessary to coerce the prophets to tell him the truth.
From the time Kel was a youngling, he has been abused, beaten, starved and neglected, forcing him to become strong by way of willpower; learning how to suppress weak and fleeting emotions like love, compassion and mercy, Kel has been told all his life that power comes from strength and strength through purpose. This sense of purpose has pushed him to be the strongest, to be the most feared, to embody the ideals of the Sith. When it came to raw potential as a youngling, Kel was the most promising. Although not as strong in body as his sparring partner Zun or as clever as the silver tongued Terric, Kel was powerful in his own way. While in his mind, he considered no trainee to be his equal, he has had to taste the bitter root of humility against Zun’s sheer might and has been bested more than once by Terric’s cunning; when it comes to matter of the force, among his peers, Kel is the most formidable.
Separately, they could easily be defeated, together their masters saw possibility. Kel, along with Zun and Terric has been given a rare opportunity; a chance to prove their worth. They have been tasked to embark on career starting mission, to the Killee-Kor arena; to go there and lure an Imperial Knight from his lair and defeat him. While no hopeful or even accomplished apprentice could do this on their own, the masters are eager to see who will be left standing when the blood and smoke clear.
Kel sees this as an opportunity to further advance his goals and to find a master worthy enough to train him. A master that will show him how to achieve the power he desires, and power that will allow him to pierce the veil of lies and find the truth of his existence.

good work Snow. add page numbers. It's extra important for you because of the force powers and it'll make it easier on both of us to look up. The lightsaber pike *increases* your reach by 1 square, so your reach is actually 2 when wielding it. List the price of the pike as 1000, you're only paying the difference between the a base LS and the pike. I'm letting Val get away with wagering his so I'll let you too. Fix this stuff for me and you'll be ready to rock.

Thrax A-88 is a prototype model produced by the Colicoid Creation Nest, at the request of Trandoshan mercenaries. They wanted a line of droids that could help them in the enslavement of their hated Wookie enemies, and thus required a droid capable of handling itself in melee as well as ranged combat. Also, they found the naturally violent and aggressive nature of the Colicoid and their droids to be very appealing to them.
Getting underway, the Colicoid began to develop a durable droid chassis, reinforced to be able to withstand a continous assault from both Wookie fists as well as their feared bowcasters. The droid was also equipped with a very fire-resistant alloy, allowing it to be used in conjunction with the common Trandoshan tactic of burning Wookie tree villages prior to an assault. The droid´s main weapon became a fierce vibroblade mounted on its right wrist, that when wielded with the mechanical strength of a droid becomes just as deadly as the Wookie ryyk blades. As a backup and ranged weapon, a Bryar rifle was installed. Somewhat aged technology, the Bryar rifle possesses an impressive capacity to overcharge its blast, increasing its power output greatly.
To complement its basic armament and increase its ability to adapt to varied combat situations, an augmented package for targeting and tracking was also installed. A series of stabilizing gyros allows the droid to remain upright even when slammed by a Wookie´s fist.
Everything would have worked out perfectly, had not the Trandoshans decided to try and back out off the payment. As it turns out, Colicoid have very short tempers, and the Thrax A-88 can kill more than just Wookies. Now standing without a buyer, and with a killing machine without purpose, the Colicoids came to think of the areas run by the pirate Rav. Figuring it to be the ultimate testing ground for the capacities of their new creation, and a good place to evaluate the model, they shipped the droid off there.
As such, Thrax A-88 is now ready to join the area league, eager to test its capacity against whatever foes await.

I had been thinking to wager my armor, but perhaps that is not good? I guess I could switch and add a template to the rifle instead, to make it more valuable.

Shazam: we need to work on your char. It has several issues and once we get it up to par you're in.
The casting will remain open indefinitely, but because of story issues joining a team after it has started will be problematic (translation: won't happen with out a good reason, and a damned good one at that).

Mando culture is a tough one. Uyric has been raised in it his whole life all, sixteen years of it. He fired his first pistol when he was five. He was running five miles a day by age seven. His father, his adoptive father had rescued Uyric from a freighter crash when he was a baby. His father taught him to shoot and his mother showed him the thrill of the jetpack. He fell in love with a young lady. They had a whirlwind romance and fell madly in love. They were married soon after, as is the case with most Mandolorians he left home to seek his fortune out in the galaxy. He sends most of his winnings home and only keeps what he needs to live and travel. He made his early money is some amateur shooting contests but never made a break. He is running low on cash and spent most of his last score on getting to the arena where he hopes he can make it big and earn some real credits.

Kyzzer essence has remained in the Perann Nebula for eons. He has worshiped the dark and tried to sway the galaxy towards entropy. The dark came to him is his deepest meditations. It whispered secret plans and desires. It desired him to leave the nebula. No Sorcerer had left the nebula since time long forgotten. It told him of a Dark disciple called Lord Cronal by some and Blackhole by others. It told him of Blackholes service to the Emperor Palpatine as a spy for the Sorcerers. It needed a new spy someone to walk the mortal worlds and explore. Most of all it wanted the soul of Blackhole. When Blackhole perished he sealed it in a crystal, this crystal was finally located on a small world called Soccorro.
Kyzzer assumed a physical form by merging with a reptile being with hard metallic like plates. He twisted and warped the body till it fit his needs then he transferred a small portion of his essence into the new form. Stretching his clawed hands and licking his face with his long reptilian tongue Kyzzer smiles and drool runs down his teeth. This scaled down version of his true being is powerful but is only mortal he will have to be careful with it.

A: Group of prototypes who get sent as part of an inter-corporation agreement to test (Par, yours could be an experimental medical procedure testing).
or
B: group of droids gone rogue using the Arena to hide in plain sight, knowing they'll be protected and to gain credits to further their cause (could easily start as A and end up as B).

Not sure how you aspire to be a race but I didn't really think any GM would let someone be a Sorcerer.

Okay, what I was getting at was the reason your chars are working together as a team. All but one of your team is some kind of prototype or another, so what I was suggesting was an agreement between corporations and manufacturers to basically beta-test you new models in the arena. I would write it (similar to Etude for team Sith, see Promoters) and build it around your individual backgrounds.
If you want to run solo thats fine too, I was just looking for a reason for your chars to begin in the arena working as a team.

Well, team Sith, want a Mando backup? could be useful. Lets get a show of hands. DarthTardis, if they're cool with it you're good, if not you can run solo. If you want to be a merc you can look at the Promoters thread [here](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=204&t=24771 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=204&t=24771") for some info on where the Sith are coming from, and you can check their backgrounds for their reason for being in the arena.

If he wants to join Team Sith, that’s fine. Just remember the monthly membership dues, and to attend weekly Dark Side meetings.
Now with this membership you get lower level parking near the elevator, access to the exclusive Dark Side men’s room and a free pass to the “Emperor’s Buffet”. All this can be yours if you join Team Sith!

LOL nice Krash. think two out of three is good enough Tardis, so consider yourself a member of team sith. Make whatever changes you need to to your background to reflect how you got involved with team sith.

I swear to uphold the finest traditions of Team Sith and solomely swear not to allow any Jedi in the darkside restroom no matter how bad they have to go. So do I really need to modify my background and have some ties to them before the arena? Couldn't we just have met at the arena and agreed to work together for mutual profit?

---

## Re: Welcome to Rav's Arena! (OPEN)

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-11 01:47:48)

they aren't there for profit, thats the thing. If you check their backgrounds you'll see they're there after an Imperial Knight who's using the Arena to hide in plain sight. If you want, you can meet em right after we start, but who's to say a bunch of ass hats with force powers are gonna be down with accepting help? lol

suggestion via Frost: Tardis can be the pilot that transported them here. He gets hired on (insert random planet here) to fly a shuttle with three passengers to Sorroco, and since he's going there anyway, he accepts. Sound good?

Tyria Regalia's more recent background.
Tyria heard the sound of her pursuer hit the wall she'd only just recovered from herself. He was gaining, and she was running out of terrain that she knew well. *If only they hadn't found out what I am.* she thought, as she rounded yet another corner. She was far enough ahead to prevent a good shot with a blaster, but if she happened upon a long alley, she'd be shot for sure.
While attempting to find some work, Tyria had come across an opening at Eden Medical Institute. She'd become bored with her existence and decided that a steady income would give her more enjoyment of "life." She had not counted on the application process however. They had performed a deep full body scan that had revealed what she was. Their interest in her went through the roof. They offered her an impressive credit allowance in return for her cooperation in allowing them to study her. At first the tests were benign, merely studying her reflexes both physically and mentally. But soon the tests became more intrusive, they bore deeper and deeper into her systems. It came to the point where she thought they might tear her apart completely and end her mechanical existence. Even living as long as she had, she was not ready to die. At first she'd come to think of this body as a curse, but as she saw the galaxy slowly change around her, she began to appreciate her own stability. She could see the present become history, knowing that she wouldn't change, only the galaxy would. As EMI's intentions became more clear to her, she resolved to escape their compound and return to her life of solidarity for a while. Wait for them to forget her, then return to the galaxy at large.
Under cover of darkness Tyria disabled one of her guards and stole his weapon.

## Re: [LE] Welcome to Rav's Arena! (Accepting Concepts)

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-16 12:16:19)

When using modified weapons (per **Web Enhancement 1**) should we be paying for the full market value?
Example: A Blaster Pistol costs $500. $50 for the license. Modifying it do do +2 damage is $1000. Market value is now $2500, $2550 if licensed (or should it be $2750?). To include it as starting equipment for my character, would I be paying $1550 or $2550? It seems cheaper to have someone do the modifications on a piece of equipment that a character already owns than to pay the full value for it? You say you want stuff broken down, so I just want to make sure my math is right. Me and Math... we don't always get along.

> ~~BW

While I´ll let Mag answer the details that are his to decide, I can point to a few other things instead. A Blaster Pistol modified with Improved Damage costs 1500 (1550 with license), so idk where you are getting the 2550 from. As for licenses, I don´t think I´ve licensed any of my gear. Also, remember that you need an item of certain value to wager on each match.

---

## Re: [LE] Welcome to Rav's Arena! (Accepting Concepts)

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-16 14:17:35)

"*Before beginning the modification, you must pay one-tenth the cost of the device, suit of armor, weapon, droid, or vehicle you wish to modify or 1,000 credits, whichever is more….The market value of a modified item is equal to the base cost of the item plus double the cost of the modifications made to it…*" [p.2, **Saga Edition Web Enhancement**]
For a $500 Blaster Pistol, this would mean $1000 for the modification and then a market value of 500+(2 x 1000), or $2500, presumably the license is still 10% of the original cost since it was licensed when purchased before the modification, and the license is non-transferable anyway I would think. So I only pay $1550 to start with the pistol licensed (though maybe that doesn't matter in the arena) but it's worth $2500 and suitable as a wager, correct?
~~BW
[**Edit:** And so if someone purchased the modified pistol from me, or if I lose it in a wager and someone wants to get a license for it, they'd pay $2500+10% = $2750. That's where that number came from.]

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-16 14:27:50)

Huh, I had actually never noticed that last line. Guess people are mainly interested in adding the mods, not what the item is worth afterwards. Anyway, when I bought my starting rifle with Improved Accuracy, I only paid 1000 Cr for he modification, so I suppose you would do the same.

## Re: [LE] Welcome to Rav's Arena! (Accepting Concepts)

### **Magical2099** (2011-03-17 00:20:45)

you pay the listed cost of the base item + listed cost of any upgrades, and you don't have to have licenses unless you want em. in other games, i would let you not buy a license then have the piece confiscated first time you were caught without one, but Killee-Kor is a lawless place run by a pirate, so you're good.
as some will point out, i bust balls over other things credit wise. lodging, healing, so on so forth; char gen is where i get lenient. and as others will point out, off-loading gear isn't the cash cow they expected, so manage your money well after you start. really depends on the character and the circumstances, but in my games credits are treated more realistically: you gotta have operating capital, you gotta make the rent, you gotta buy ammo, etc.

## Re: [LE] Welcome to Rav's Arena! (Accepting Concepts)

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-17 00:26:58)

So the unlicensed Blaster Pistol example above would just be $1500 then?

**Kaz's Story**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

When Lora Torev went missing, not many people took notice. Just another arrogant teenage runaway leaving home to live a life of independence. Her older brother, Kaz, knew her too well. He asked around and, despite the reluctance of local authorities, determined she had been abducted by slavers and sold to a prominent Hutt for pleasure. Naturally outraged, Kaz was kept back at every attempt to contact the Hutt lord Slomo and beg for her freedom. Finally, after months of persistence, he was given permission to buy back Lora - for the incredible sum of 100,000,000 credits. Completely desperate to get the money as fast as possible, Kaz decided to win the money at Rav's arena. He has arrived with the meagerest of armaments and barely enough equipment to wager - some weapons he was able to obtain at discount by a sympthetic but distant relative. He knows he might die in the arena, but the fate that awaits his sister is far worse than death.
Not usually a killer, Kaz spent a few years as low-level security for occasional employers and did alright. He's not one for frills, and generally wears clothing that isn't too loose or that would hinder his movement. His blaster pistol hangs at his side, his knife hidden in his boot. His dark blue skin tone and black j'ati tatoos contrast with his bright orange eyes and he tends to stick out in a crowd - even among his own kind.

I understand I can't use the wager in the match, that's fine. Let me know what needs work and I can edit accordingly. Thanks!

Background
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Growing up, Lee didn't always see eye to eye with his parents. He didn't have a horrible relationship with them, but not a great one either. His love was breaking the rules, and pushing limits. He got sent home from school all the time for it.
When he got old enough, his parents signed him up for JATC (Junior Army Training Corp) at his local recruiting office. He grew to love the military life, finding solace within the tight bounds of military life.
He joined the Army just days after completing his secondary education, and though he did initially well, his old habits began to resurface in the face of extreme hardship. Within months of completing his basic training, he had been in and out of military prisons, and finally washed out of the service for disciplinary problems.
He spent that night at the local cantina, drinking away his woes. He even joined a friendly game of sabaac, though he was doing poorly from the start, and the stakes just kept getting higher and higher. At some point that night, Lee blacked out, either form too much drink, or someone slipped his something. He woke up on a transport to some crazy planet, only being told that he "owed" a rather large debt to someone named Goodo. He was instructed to find him when he got to said planet, to discuss his current predicament...and to get the binder cuffs removed.

Just in case you haven't checked it out yet, **page one** of this thread might help on some things. Here's the piece on credits, for instance...
> **Mag said:** credits = max starting of first level + 2000 (make sure to include a detailed breakdown of expenditures) no Mandalorian armors from KOTOR (may be available through play) droid characters may by heuristic processors for 1000 credits (not suitable for wager).

Also, there's a fairly standard character sheet template somewhere on the site, look around for it. I'll edit in the exact location when I find it. Welcome to GC! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Tak, like most other Mandalorians, spent his earlier years in a mercenary company meandering across deep space from contract to contract. He kept his head down and always pushed beyond his abilities to succeed, such was the mindset of all his people: Failure is a fate worse than Death. Having taken on progressively challenging assignments with aplomb, boredom was starting to set in and Tak was starting to ask himself if there was any challenge out there anymore. It just so happened that the opportunity to reignite his passion came up in conversation over a drink in the ship's cantina. One of the new recruits had butted into the discussion exclaiming that Tak should head to Rav's Arena if he wanted a challenge. Naturally as the young Twi'lek had stepped out of line and split half of his drink over Tak, he got a swift smack in the jaw and has carried away. However on further enquiry into the matter it seemed like a viable course of action. Defeating skilled combatants while being worshipped for his prowess in battle reminded him of his homeworld. "I will become the Mandalore of Rav's Arena" he vowed to himself.
There was the small problem of his employment and he doubted that his superiors would let him up sticks and leave on a whim, especially not one of their more capable charges. So Tak proposed that he fight for the company, Krayt Securtities, using his success within the outfit as a bargaining tool. "When they see how skilled our employees are in combat, it will draw in even more contracts. It's free advertising! Win-win! And it's not like he's going to lose!" was the vibe of his leaders as he left the conference room with enough credits to pay his transport to the Arena.
Tak's vicious looking angular face is complemented by the black and red Krath combat jumpsuit he sports, which hides his grey skin coursed in scars. The majority of his scars come from tiny barbs in the lining of the jumpsuit. He remembers asking the vendor about the suit when he bought it and all he could reply with was: "It's Krath what did you expect?" Seeing it as a further challenge he snapped his purchase. His dark hair is tied back in a short pony tail so it doesn't fall in the way of his blood red eyes in combat.

Starting Creds - 3000 (from starting soldier) + 2000 (Arena start bonus) = 5000
Spent - 2200 (gun) + 2500 (armour) + 195 (utility belt and contents) + 50 (holster) = 4945
Credits leftover = 5000 - 4945 = 55cr
