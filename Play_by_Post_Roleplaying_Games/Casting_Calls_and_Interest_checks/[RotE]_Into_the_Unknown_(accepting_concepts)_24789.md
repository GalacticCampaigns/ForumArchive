</div>

It's a time of peace and prosperity as a Golden Age of the Republic takes root. The Republic seeking to expand its influence and knowledge prepares to send explorers into the depths of space to chart new routes and discover what lies beyond the charted expanse. Working together the Republic and the Jedi Exploration Corps seeks volunteers from all walks of life and experiences to partake in the mission.
Combat will not be a focal point to this campaign; the emphasis being on exploration and mysteries. That is to say that at some point you will not be forced into conflicts.
Those looking for an equivalent if how this will play out. It will start out a bit like Star Trek and turn into Lost.
Please use the following to submit your character concepts. Feel free to go as depth as you wish, but mind you I DO NOT WANT STAT BLOCKS. You are not limited to how many characters you submit as I will choose between all concepts the ones I feel will work best. A ship will be provided by the ExploCorp/Republic co-op so it will not be required in anyone's background.
As I am always accepting concepts submitted concepts will be critiqued for compatibility with the current objective and other characters.

## Re: Into the Unknown (open)

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-31 08:54:02)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Agro</span>**
Male Ho'Din 27
**Brief Background:** Agro began his training as an infant, as is customary of a Jedi. After reaching Knighthood, he traveled back to his homeworld of Moltok to find the massive industrialization underway. Sickened by the willful destruction of his planet by his own kind, he left. By abandoning his assignment he displeased the Jedi Council. After heated words were traded he resigned his title and left the Order. He then began traveling the galaxy, working as a botanist and living in harmony with nature. The spread and growth of civilization continuously intrudes on his peace, leading him to move on regularly.
**Past Adventures:** Argo has had few adventures since becoming a Knight. Before his advancement however he and his Master were tasked with handling a group of pirates. They managed to eliminate the pirate chieftain, and afterwards the fleet seemed to dissolve.
**Personality:** Vanity and pride are his downfall, and even his Jedi training failed to remove these traits. When his vanity isn't in question, he is quite charming and amiable.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** The chance to see new worlds and new ecosystems drew Argo like a moth to flame. He hopes to one day find an isolated paradise to live out his years in peace and quiet.

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-31 09:17:10)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Bran Caradog</span>**
Male Human 24
**Brief Background:** Born to a poor family in the Hedd system, Caradog quickly found work and his skills in high demand, off planet at least. With his Varg Ferro he has found some measure of success as a tracker and guide, able to traverse wilds he's never seen with ease.
**Past Adventures:** Bran found himself working for an Arkanian Corporation at one point, and after refusing to follow their orders to help them exploit a beautiful and peaceful world found himself hunted across the galaxy.
**Personality:** Bran is a quiet and introspective sort, who often proffers the company of his Varg over other sentients. Those who persevere and break through his shell find a warm, thoughtful soul.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** Knowing his survival skills would be invaluable on this expedition he signed up without a second thought, knowing it would also get him beyond the reach of the Arkanian corporation that hunts him.

## Re: Into the Unknown (open)

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-31 10:53:21)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Ashlow Arkham</span>**
Male Arkanian 38
**Brief Background:** Ashlow is the owner of several companies, the largest of which is AshCorp, which manufactures a vast variety of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. Since making his fortune at such a young age, he longs for adventure and as a result has taken up big game hunting. With his pack of engineered Dark Wolves he has taken to vacationing and hunting almost exclusively.
**Past Adventures:** Ashlow has hunted most larger game in the know galaxy, including the dreaded rancor.
**Personality:** Aloof and arrogant, Ashlow is often hard to talk to unless you are talking to him about one of his passions, namely sciences and hunting.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** Having seen most of large game the known galaxy has to offer, this expedition into the uncharted regions brings challenges he otherwise would never get to face.

## Re: Into the Unknown (open)

### **Anazider** (2010-08-31 13:52:12)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Khadeshi a.k.a. &quot;The Viper&quot;</span>**
Male Zeltron Age: 20
**Brief Background:** Born into a family of merchants, Khadeshi was sold to Ghorva the Hutt at the age of 7, to settle his parent's gambling debts. From that point on, Khadeshi was trained by the Hutt and her cartel as one of her "Jewels"; trained assistants that performed whatever dirty-work Ghorva required, whether that be assassination, messenger work, "companionship" to reward associates or entice clientele, dancing, and a wide-variety of other deeds. During this time, Khadeshi gained the codename of the "Viper" due to his his sensually-hypnotic movements and methods of murder.
**Past Adventures:** On one of his missions, Khadeshi learns that his parents were actually setup by Ghorva, with the intention of both of them becoming her slaves, but he was offered up instead. From that point onward, Khadeshi planned his escape, and during an "entertaining" session, he manages to end the Hutt and make his escape with a considerable amount of her credits. Since then, "The Viper" has been on a very extended vacation, traveling from system to system seeing the galaxy and dodging those bounty hunters, spies, and assassins sent by Ghurva's family in retribution for the Hutt's death.
**Personality:** As capricious and fun-loving as the most hedonistic of Zeltron, Khadeshi has learned over the rough years of his life to wring the most from any given moment and enjoy life in whatever ways are sentient-ly possible. To that extent, he planet-hops in search of thrills, fulfilling whatever whim he has for the moment and desperately evading those that seek him. Beneath the carefree, fun-loving exterior beats a well-guarded heart and a pragmatic mind.
**You Ended Up Here Because:** Desperately seeking escape from a pair of bounty hunters, Khadeshi stows aboard an ExplorCorps transport, and inevitably signs up for the venture to avoid being spaced or handed over to the authorities.

## Re: Into the Unknown (open)

### **simplyscribed** (2010-08-31 16:15:10)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Temin Hawke</span>**
Male Ryn, age 24
**Brief Background:** Temin, perhaps more than even most Ryn, was born to travel. Conceived, carried, born, and bred aboard the ship of his two smuggler parents, he has only ever known a life of travel, trade, and trickery.
Even as a youth he was groomed by his parents to assist in the family business, picking up the necessary smarts and skills to fill any role on their ship or as part of their operations. However, as soon as he reached adolescence Temin left his parents. Not out of rebellion, nor distaste for their lifestyle, but simply out of a desire to chart his own course.
Now a young adult, Temin has connived, tricked, and in the direst circumstances worked his way the length and breadth of the Galaxy.
**Past Adventures:** Temin is the very definition of a "loveable rogue", and has gotten himself into trouble in almost every starport in the Galaxy. He is hardly a Face in the Galaxy's underworld, but he is definitely a known Name (his parents, on the other hand, are Faces). He is famous for taking on missions that even other smugglers consider too dangerous, just because they strike him as a fun test of his skills.
**Personality:** Temin shares the character traits typical of his species. Fun, outgoing, colourful, and consumed by the need for travel and adventure, he has inevitably lead a varied and exciting life. He is fearless, too, willing to try new things and put his all into his life regardless of the cost.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** Temin has done some freelancing for the Republic before, performing activities too questionable for actual government assets to be assigned. He is after all criminally minded, and the only tasks he has distaste for are those involving wetwork. For the most part he has only been the pilot on these missions, though teams he is assigned to soon find his other skills make him a valuable asset. On his last mission Temin and his team were assigned to infiltrate FalCorp. The company President was suspected of stealing Republic military secrets. The mission ended in failure, and the team made a hasty escape in a stolen transport. Temin's own ship was left behind and impounded. The *Lunar Hawk*'s presence in a local starport, abandoned at the same time as the aborted mission took place, incriminates the smuggler. He is therefore laying low for a while, working for the Republic in a more official capacity. They have promised to make amends for the loss of his ship, though so far have not been forthcoming.
Temin may be on the mission as a member of bridge staff and/or pilot of on-board scout craft.

## Re: Into the Unknown (open)

### **Sketchpad** (2010-08-31 16:31:26)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Geesh</span>**
Male Gand 23
**Brief Background:** The Gand who would become Geesh was born of a simple family. His father worked as a mechanic, operating a small shop that his family lived above. Content to become successor to his father's skills, he who would be Geesh was unaware that his father had dealings with the more violent criminals on the planet. Among them was one named Jaask, a brutal being who lived by the rule of the gun and spoke the language of violence. It was a language he conveyed well, especially to Geesh's father one night, when the brutal Gand beat the mechanic to death.
Vowing revenge, Geesh hunted the murderer, 'feeling' where he was, and, in one fell swoop, set the scales right with the same spanner that was used to kill his father. Not wanting the unwanted violence to go further, Geesh turned himself over to the authorities, who in turn, put him on trial for murder. The Gand elders felt there was a balance that was achieved here and gave the young Gand his name: Geesh, he who avenges. But, because a crime was indeed committed, the youth was given gear to survive and exiled from Gand until the mystic fates felt he should come back. Accepting his fate, Geesh took his gear and boarded a shuttle bringing him to one of the space stations, the first step in a larger destiny ...
**Past Adventures:** While having some mechanical skills, Geesh quickly discovered that he wasn't a bad shot either. Gaining employment aboard *The Wandering Rancor*, a large, bulk freighter, he took on apprenticeship with the ship's chief engineer, Sesko Mallurn. In his spare time, he befriended one of the ship's enforcers, Tallok, who encouraged th young Gand's combat skills.
After his tour was up, Geesh moved on to a few other ships of the same caliber, taking on the duties of both engineering and enforcement. After a few years, fate would knock on his door again, as he ran into another Gand named Makkar, who was a member of the Findsman. She told Geesh that she saw many things in his future, but, in the end, he would join her in the quest of all Findsman. Deep down, he knew she was right ... again he could 'feel' what she'd said. Following her advice, he joined up with the Jedi Exploration Corps in hopes of finding his fate ...
**Personality:** Like most of his species, Geesh is soft-spoken and humble. He enjoys hearing and telling great stories, but also is attracted to the thrill of the hunt. He's a very spiritual Gand and often serves as enforcer, engineer and spiritual guide when he can. Knowing that he's fairly versatile already, he's never one to turn away from learning new things ... even beyond his skill set.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** It was his destiny. Geesh is following the strings of fate and believes wholeheartedly that he's here because it's where he's meant to be. He looks to the unknown as a way to get closer to the spirits that guide him, as well as to protect the crew he's meant to protect.

## Re: Into the Unknown (open)

### **Sketchpad** (2010-08-31 16:52:34)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Cha-Voorin Sirro</span>**
Male Krevaaki 30
**Brief Background:** Hailing from the Dantooine Jedi Academy, Cha-Voorin Sirro was raised among the Jedi as a Padawan learner. Early on, his Master knew that the young Krevaaki had an affinity for learning, as his grades excelled as a youngling and he was often the top of his class in academic events. As he entered his teen years, he was paired with Master Edria Pal, a Draethos Jedi who was also a member of the Jedi Expeditionary Corps.
Together, Padawan and Master journeyed to the far reaches of The Rim and shared adventures for years. As Cha-Voorin (or "Cha" to those close to him) began taking on missions of his own, he spent less and less time with his Master, as she was frequently called back to Dantooine to aid in training duties there. Eventually, the responsibility of exploring the galaxy became his, as Edria was brought on as a full time instructor, leaving her charge alone in the galaxy.
**Past Adventures:** During one of his early solo missions, Cha-Voorin ran afoul of the Dusk Fire pirate group. Together with other Jedi, he was able to free a passenger liner that had gotten snared in one of their many traps. During the conflict, he met a dark Force user called 'Bridge' with whom he fought and escaped from. From all appearances, this 'Bridge' had been working with the Dusk Fire and managed to kill a few of the Krevakki's allies.
Though they managed to escape from one another, Cha knows deep down that their sabers will cross again. He only hopes that, when that inevitable encounter happens, that he has the strength to help this tortured soul by either showing him the light or releasing him into The Force.
**Personality:** Cha-Voorin is a responsible, peaceful and caring being that enjoys the thrill of exploring and helping those in need. While not a push-over by any means, he prefers to solve encounters with diplomacy over violence. But, should the need arise for his lightsaber, he's quite adept at its use. As a Jedi, he follows their precepts quite closely and has been recognized not only as a superior diplomat, but also as a fierce debater, especially when defending his faith.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** It was where he belonged. Having served with the JEC, he would've been an easy choice to work on this cooperative expedition. He brings with him diplomacy, experience and knowledge and offers them freely to those who may need it.

### **Sketchpad** (2010-08-31 17:19:06)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Fynneous &quot;Fynn&quot; Kol</span>**
Male Human (Corellian) 28
**Brief Background:** Fynn never meant to be a scout. It was more destiny's hand that forced him into the role. A superior pilot, Fynn prided himself as a fair man, especially when it came to jobs he took when he was captain of the freighter *"Dark Star"*. But all good things come to an end and even a fair man has his limits. During a simple cargo run, he was ambushed by a mercenary group who worked for *"The Stellar Ghost"*, an up and coming crime cartel that worked out of The Outer Rim. Agreeing to give up his cargo, the mercenaries took much more than that. Sucker-punching Fynn, they planted a bomb on his ship and made away with everything he had: Credits, cargo ... they even took his astrogation unit. Barely making it to the escape pod, he watched as his ship was blown to dust while he bobbed around in the small pod that became his home for a week.
But, as the old Kol luck would have it, he was eventually found by a Jedi Expedition Corps ship and brought on board. Spending the better part of a month before they could get him back to Corellia, he knew that with no ship and limited savings he had nothing to get started again. So, in hopes of maybe earning back some creds, as well as what he once called a reputation, he joined up with the Jedi Expeditionary Corps as a pilot.
**Past Adventures:** During his fourth mission with the JEC, Fynn once again ran into the same mercs that worked for *"The Stellar Ghost"*. This time around, they targeted him during a planetary layover and attempted to rough him up. Luckily some of the other JEC troops were around to scare them off. But it's gotten Fynn to wonder why him and exactly who is this guy?
**Personality:** Fynn's got the worst luck in the galaxy it seems. While not a bad guy, bad things seem to follow him around. In his current role, he remains a fair person and mostly listens to what he's told. But, like a Nexu, he hasn't changed stripes that much. He's still a bit cocky, shoot-by-the-hip and, according to most, a bit crazy in the cockpit of a starship. He once bragged that, if it has engines, he could pilot it. The frightening thing is, he might be right ...
**You Ended Up Here Because …** It's a job and he kind of owes the JEC for pulling his sorry butt from space. He volunteered for the mission in hopes of avoiding 'certain' people and for a chance to prove his worth.

## Re: Into the Unknown (open)

### **Sketchpad** (2010-08-31 17:53:55)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Xerondis &quot;Xero&quot; Maas</span>**
Male Miralukan 31
**Brief Background:** Xerondis Maas was a perfect student. His master, Chadin, a Cathar Jedi, proudly stood by the youth as they traveled the Core Worlds with his other Padawans, Keddrick Dorrin, a human, and Jondo, a Twi'lek. The four had become inseparable except in times of relaxation. The more contemplative Xerondis would often meditate in his spare time, while the other two were more adventurous and ended up in various taverns or drinking establishments. During some downtime in the Tapani Sector, Keddrick and Jondo had found themselves on the wrong side of a noble's family and aggression quickly elevated. Feeling their distress, Xerondis quickly contacted their master, who quickly joined his two Padawans. Unfortunately, it was too late for them. Enjoying a life of spoiled rules, the noble's son, Theonis Mecetti (under the alias of Theonis Alogol) killed the two in cold blood and mortally wounded Chadin upon his arrival. In his room, Xerondis felt the violence that was committed and called the authorities. While they were able to save Chadin, Theonis walked, having far too much political sway to serve time in some plebeian prison.
Wracked with grief and the feeling of his fellow Padawan's death, Xerondis took matters into his own hands. Finding his way into the noble's home, the Jedi slew Theonis and any near him in cold blood. Feeling the anger his Padawan had just emitted, Chadin ordered the Miralukan to be bound by law and transported to the proper authorities on Coruscant. Standing trial for what he'd done, Xerondis denied nothing and admitted that the noble deserved to taste justice. For this, he was sentenced to years of imprisonment to reflect on his deeds.
**Past Adventures:** While serving his time, Xero (as others had called him) has started on the road of redemption. During a riot at the prison, he reached out with his abilities and managed to quell the group's leaders in a non-violent way. Since then, he's taken on the role of advocate in many arguments and has gained a bit of a following among the prisoners. While the law hasn't admonished him of his crimes, the world inside the prison has become a better place for him being there.
**Personality:** While in his youth he was an angry man, Xero has become more contemplative and knowledgeable of many things. He's a voracious reader, a good speaker and enjoys the role he's come to take on. His master had always said he was a good man, and in the past few years it seems that he's coming to see that.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** Conscripted. Xero could be useful if there's trouble, as well as working in a diplomatic function. With the amount of knowledge he has, in addtion to his Jedi skills, he's a shoe in for an 'expendable' solider for this mission. Let the JEC take care of him, he should've stayed a Jedi problem anyhow.

## Re: Into the Unknown (open)

### **Sketchpad** (2010-08-31 22:34:03)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Baal Va</span>**
Male Togruta 27
**Brief Background:** Heralding from a long line of Jedi, Baal was born without a link to The Force. Growing up, his siblings quickly disappeared to the Jedi Academy, while he moved through the Galactic Academy and became a Sector Ranger. While his family was proud of what he'd become, Baal always felt that he had to prove himself, pushing his limits to become the very best. Making captain at an early age, the togrutan enforcer was given his own ship and crew under his command. Christened *The Stellar Enforcer*, the ship and its crew were given the border regions of the Outer Rim to patrol and charged with reducing criminal activities.
But, given that monumental task, Baal took it upon himself to clean up what he could. At first it was the more blatant crimes: piracy, shipjacking and drug trafficking. But as he and his team worked to stop the crimes, they discovered that they actually had a singular opponent: Eschik Ta'al, a Falleen crime lord that also ran one of the more successful shipping companies in The Outer Rim. When they went to confront Ta'al on his activities, it seemed that the criminal had fled into the Unknown Regions as part of an exploratory mission for his company. Determined to get his man, Baal reported to his superiors and was denied the ability to pursue him. In response, the togrutan put in a leave of absence and joined the first exploratory team heading into The Unknown Regions. Nothing would stop Baal Va from getting his man ...
**Past Adventures:** During his time on *The Stellar Enforcer*, Baal had encountered The Dusk Fire pirates and managed to stop their operations in a border post. However, during the battle, Baal had encountered a snivvian pirate lieutenant called Trask Holun. The two battled and the snivvian managed to escape, though only by loosing an eye in the process. Vowing revenge, Holun took down part of the station's exterior wall in his escape, making it impossible for the togrutan to follow. While Baal does consider Trask a threat, he's more concerned with getting the bigger fish.
**Personality:** Baal is a dedicated individual. He's honorable, caring and protective of his family and friends. In most instances, he obeys the letter of the law and has issues when those around him do not, often going as far as speaking to them or, in extreme situations, taking them into custody to understand the ramifications of their deeds. He's hardly a singular man, though this manhunt for Eschik Ta'al has driven him beyond his breaking point.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** Dedication. Baal has never lost a man and isn't about to start. He's joined the JEC in hopes of tracking down Eschik Ta'al and bringing him to justice.

### **Parmenter** (2010-09-01 09:53:24)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Jeic &quot;Jack&quot; &quot;Doc&quot; Tronnh</span>**
Male Zabrak 52
**Brief Background:**Jeic has been a student of science all his life. For a time, he taught it at the Byblos University, and later he brought his talents to the masses, convincing the Senate to initiate projects to help increase the standard of living throughout the galaxy, by helping the less fortunate worlds of the Republic build the infrastructre neccesary for societal growth. He set up projects for housing developments, power plants, roads, irrigation. No project was too small, and whenever he found himself out of his field he would seek out the experts, and have them act as advisors to the project. Everything seemed to be going so well until a Senator got greedy and tried skimming money from one project by changing one of the material suppliers after the budget had been passed, thousands of lives were lost, and all of the blame fell upon Jeic. Though no charges were brought against him, his reputation was forever ruined.
**Past Adventures:** Twenty years ago, using what money he had saved, Jeic moved to the outer rim, setting up shop as a mechanic. There, he helped people individually. Fixing that which was broken, because that is what truly made him happy. On his new home, his reputation began to grow once again. Soon, visitors from other systems would come in search of him and his expertise.
**Personality:** Jeic is a firm believer that technology makes societies prosper peacefully, if people come together rather than fight amongst themselves. A sentiment that is not shared by the rest of his species. Much of his youthful optimism is gone due to the Senate debacle, however, there are things that spark it with new life, such as bringing knowledge and understanding to those who seek it.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** He was sought out and recruited by the Jedi Exploration Corps. The Republic had deep reservations, given Jeic's history, but the wisdom of the Jedi was not something to question, even for Senators. The invitation was something he could not refuse, it was a chance to learn and teach at the same time.

### **Anonymous** (2010-09-01 11:38:38)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Trisst Galssaw</span>**
Male Mrlssi 25
**Brief Background:** Like many of his species, Trisst had a desire and love of knowledge. He studied at some of the best universities on Mrlssi and became known as a lover of past civilizations. He spent most of his free time attempting to decipher ancient texts and technologies; he has been attempting to develop theories on the rise and fall of civilizations through the study of accounts of wars. Once he was old enough, he began to lead off world archaeological digs. He lead expeditions on several worlds and made a few minor discoveries. Unfortunately, these discoveries were not big enough to encourage his supporters to continue funding his efforts. His failure deterred him from returning to Mrlssi, and he instead set out on his own - one of the first to do so in the history of Mrlssi. He signed on with a team of traders who found his abilities of persuasion quite useful in negotiations. The journies with the traders lead him to a dozen backwater worlds where he used his extensive knowledge to improve living situations. He soon found that it was a commodity that could be used on such backwater worlds. The traders used it to their advantage, and began to become a fairly wealthy lot.
**Past Adventures:** All of that changed, however, when the ship fell under attack by pirates. For the first time in his life, Trisst found himself in the line of fire. Using some of the weapons that he had been given from some of the backwater worlds, Trisst sought to help the traders fend off the pirates. He tried to direct them in battle, but they were highly outnumbered. After stealing the cargo, the pirates left the derelict craft in space with most of the crew dead. Trisst and two survivors managed to get the life support running again and set off a distress beacon. A rescue vessel arrived and Trisst was ferried to a nearby star system. He was looking for more work when he saw an offer to explore the Unkown...
**Personality:** Trisst, like most of his species, desires knowledge over material wealth. He loves trying to figure out what makes things "tick." He loves trying to piece together history, and he learned that negotiation also has the workings of a puzzle. He also has a love of tactics, as it is a "puzzle" of a different sort. He is humble and seeks to be at peace with everyone.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** A chance to explore the unknown might give Trisst the discovery of a lifetime - perhaps dozens of lifetimes. Perhaps he would discover a vital counterpart to his theory on civilizations. Either way, he could not pass up the chance to study the unkown.

### **Anazider** (2010-09-01 13:52:59)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Prince Anazider of House Xin&#39;dan</span>**
Male Falleen Age 21
**Brief Background:** Born the only heir of House Xin'dan, as well as his father's starship design firm, Xin'dan Transports Unlimited, Anazider was raised with the best the galaxy has to offer. Groomed for command from an early age, Anazider became the youngest member of XTU's board of chairmen at the age of 16, and now spearheads the company's acquisitions department.
**Past Adventures:** Winner of the last three Coruscanti Regalia's, the galaxy's premier Star Yacht racing tournament. The Regalia is famous for serving as a platform for starship designers to showcase their latest products, but it is more infamous for all the blackmailing, sabotage, and cheating that is perpetrated behind the scenes. Amongst the competition's participants, Anazider has earned the title of "Electrum-Tongued Prince", and the moniker is used either as a superlative or a slight depending on whom one talks to.
**Personality:**  Arrogant and debonaire, the Prince is known throughout the Galaxy's social circles as a bit of a playboy, saber rake, and all around dashing scoundrel. But beneath the roguish facade lies a shrewed mind for business and a love of intrigue and learning, with the nobleman preferring to be hands-on with many of his endeavors.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** Corporate expansion! Lord Xin'dan would not have his competitors, or the galactic government for that matter, beat him to the punch of finding unexploited resources, and so after the standard greasing of palms and back-office dealings, he has sent his best operative, Prince Anazider, as representative on the endeavor.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Pyar &quot;Iron Knight&quot; Indesqu (&quot;The Gaffer&quot;)</span>**
Male near-human, age 57<div style="text-align: right;">
![pyarindesqu.jpg](http://img840.imageshack.us/img840/5861/pyarindesqu.jpg)
</div>

**Brief Background:** The Indesqu line has produced distinguished warriors and officers for centuries, and all have served the Republic with distinction.
Faithfully, a young Pyar followed in the footsteps of his forefathers. He survived several campaigns and joined an elite unit of commandos. Their taskforce was capable of deployment in all manner of conditions though they specialised in zero-G combat and boarding actions. Years later he captained the unit, and rightly earned the nickname all Indesqu officers before him had also earned: "Iron Knight". He always pushed himself and his men to the limit, determined to live up to the family name, and "Pyar's Paladins" became quite famous among military circles.
Pyar wanted to progress much further, just as his ancestors had before him, yet despite his exemplary service Pyar found himself constantly being overlooked for further promotion. Furthermore, the more he pushed his men to stand out, the more dangerous the missions they were required to perform. What had once seemed like blue milk runs (even when they weren't) now seemed like suicide missions, and the Paladins took frequent heavy losses. Turn-around negatively affected the unit's cohesion and morale, and it was only a matter of time before the Paladins suffered their first utter defeat. Pyar came out of the operation the only survivor, himself on death's door.
Thoroughly disenchanted of his prior sense of duty and honour, and burdened with a crushing weight of guilt, Pyar left military service. He became the first of his line to retire early by any route other than life's expiration. He was discharged from his duties honourably, though that meant little to his family: Pyar had become a disappointment. He couldn't bring himself to care, and disappeared to the Rims to become an asteroid miner, a career in which his prior experience proved rather useful.
**Past Adventures:** On the occasion that changed the direction of his life, Pyar led his men on a doomed assault of a pirate base. The pirates had taken a senator hostage and were demanding a ridiculous ransom, and it was the responsibility of the Paladins to extract him. The Paladins, however, were not quite the elite unit they had been at the height of Pyar's command; the pirates on the other hand were far better organised than intel had suggested. The Paladins were decimated, and Pyar was wounded. To this day he doesn't know exactly what happened after that, only that Lieutenant Dorak (one of the few surviving members of his original unit and a good personal friend) dragged him free and escaped on a small freighter. Apparently Dorak was able to treat and bind Pyar's wounds and plot in a hyperspace course before fainting at the controls, dying soon after of his own internal injuries. Pyar was recovered in sorry state and treated, but the bacta could not repair all the damage. His entire left side is now mechanised, the arm and leg both replaced with robotic parts.
**Personality:** Even among miners Pyar retains much of the personality he developed in his old life, unable to tolerate poor performance among the men. Though he expects the same strict discipline from others that he practices himself, those who he comes to respect professionally find him to be quite pleasant underneath all the gruffness. He is fiercely loyal to those who deserve it, and he retains his sense of honour despite its tarnish. He is prepared to put himself on the line to protect his juniors, and is always there to advise them. When things go wrong in the mines or predators threaten the miners he is always first to take charge and prevent disaster. Naturally he is as well respected among miners as his name is among military men, and he has earned the new nickname "Gaffer".
**You Ended Up Here Because …** Agents of the Republic tracked Pyar down with the hope of pressing him back into service. Though surprised at his refusal, they realised it may be possible to persuade him in a more indirect manner. They hired him to take part in the exploratory mission, for which his skills both old and new seemed eminently suitable. They intend that the experience of serving the Republic once more, irrespective of in what capacity, should reignite the Iron Knight's passion.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

'Pyar Indesqu?' the Zeltroni woman asks, favouring the older man before her with her most beautiful smile. She had singled him out the moment she entered the miner's bar and lost no time in her approach, ignoring the hungry looks directed her way from other tables.
'I mighta known a guy with that name once,' the man replies, not looking up from his drink, 'who's asking?'
'I think you can drop the poodoo now, Captain Indesqu,' she replies while making herself comfortable in the seat opposite, 'I can see you're the Iron Knight.'
He looks up then, focusing as intense a gaze on her as she has ever known. His steel grey eyes give away nothing, but the rest of his expression says it all: she has made him angry. She is not a woman easily ruffled, but finds herself forced to look away.
He grunts and relaxes his posture slightly, apparently somewhat mollified by this small victory.
'I am not the Iron Knight. Folks round here call me Gaffer. It is a name I can actually be proud of.'
'Your service record is something to be proud of, Captain. The Judicial Fleet rarely sees such men as you. It was a great loss to the Republic when you retired.'
'And a great comfort to me.'
She crosses her legs and holds out her left hand. After a moment's thought he returns the favour. She holds his hand a little longer than appropriate, examining it.
'It's very good workmanship, you really can't tell.'
The Gaffer sneers as he snatches the hand away.
'The Indesqu always get the best.'
She smiles again.
'I should introduce myself. I am Carria Delhua, and I represent the Judicial Fleet. I was dispatched to find you by Commander Tiith. You remember him?'
'Miss Delhua, please get to the point.'
'The Paladins have been reformed.'
Pyar stiffens in his seat. Eyes locked on her, he takes a healthy swig of his drink but says nothing.
'They have been operating under the command of Captain Hinch. You don't know him, but I can tell you this much: the unit has lost it's magic. No longer are the Paladins exemplars among the Fleet.'
'Of course not,' Pyar scoffs and there is a measure of unmistakeable pride in his tone, 'New officer, new soldiers, new unit. They aren't the Paladins.'
'Quite,' Carria responds smoothly, 'that is exactly the same conclusion Commander Tiith has arrived at. He believes the Paladins cannot *be* the Paladins unless the Iron Knight can be the Iron Knight.'
'What are you saying?' He asks, the anger returned to his voice.
Carria refuses to be cowed this time, and looks directly at him. She examines the lines of his face, the nose slightly crooked from one too many breaks, the silver no longer creeping across his black hair and beard but rather beginning to march in closed ranks. He had been handsome once, she realises. No, though matured, he is handsome still.
'Don't try using your pheremones on me, young lady,' he admonishes, 'I'm too old and cranky to be much impressed.'
Carria laughs.
'Don't you think I'm beautiful?'
'I think stars are beautiful, but I don't reach out to touch them. Nor do I chase them across space. That's a fool's errand, as has yours been: if you expect me to return to the Paladins then you're wasting your time.'
'You would be promoted if you did. Your command would be larger, your reputation would grow, your place among the noble Indesqu cemented forever in historical archives.'
Pyar scowls, mood turning suddenly thunderous.
'I think you should leave, miss Carria.'
'Wait, I apologise. Forget that offer then, but if you won't return to the Paladins at least consider taking on a mission for the Republic. It's a simple exploratory mission, but you could do much good if you joined it. it's not about ranks or power, nor duty... it's just a job, one that you are eminently qualified for. Here, I'll give you the details so you can think about it.'
She passes him a datapad.
'I believe there are rooms here? I'll stay for the next few days so you have time to give me a considered reply.'
The Zeltron grins.
'And you can visit me before then, should you wish.'
With a final wink she leaves the table, lightly running her fingertips across Pyar's shoulder on her way. The old soldier watches her approach the bar and start a friendly dialogue with the young man there.
'Your damn pheremones won't work on me,' he mutters to himself.
When Carria turns from the bar and gives him a wave, he quickly looks away, grabs his drink, and downs the remainder of the liquid therein. Focusing his attention anywhere but toward the bar he finds his eyes drawn to the datapad, and he reluctantly pulls it toward him.
*I won't go back to that life* he thinks. *Never.*
*But it couldn't hurt me to take a look.*

</details>

Though he is admittedly rusty, and perhaps past his prime, Pyar is still a competent individual well-suited to the work of an exploratory mission. He specialises in Zero-G and could have been hired to perform miscellaneous duties outside the safety of the ship including repairs. Alternatively he may have signed on as security, though even if not he would still play an active role in the defence of the mission regardless of official duty.
Pyar himself is uncertain whether his old ambition has resurfaced, and has considered that he may be attempting to assuage his sense of guilt over the fall of the Paladins by protecting the mission. Whatever the case, something within him convinced him to sign up, and his sense of honour prevents him backing out now.

### **Anazider** (2010-09-02 11:26:40)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Kaz &quot;Kriff It&quot; Krieger</span>**
Male Human Age: 30
**Brief Background:** Born in one of Coruscant's many crumbling under-sectors, Kaz learned how to survive on the streets by being a little quicker, a little stronger, and a lot crazier than the next guy. For years Kaz served as a hitman for the various gangs of his home sector, until he came of age and decided to join the Galactic Republic's expeditionary forces in order to receive better weaponry. Serving with distinction wherever the fighting was the hottest, Kaz gained entrance to Galactic Republic Special Operations Command (GRSOC), and served with the best commando squads the Republic had to offer. But after repeated citations for recklessness and not following orders, Kaz was discharged from the military (albeit honorably) for being too much of a loose cannon, and has since served as a mercenary, accepting the unacceptable mission, and flitting from operation to operation before his reputation catches up with him.
**Past Adventures:** Participated in the siege of the Interstellar Banking Consortium on Telerath by the Batamashir Pirate clan. He and his 7 man commando unit held off the pirate assault for three days, against nearly twenty-times their number without loss of civilian life, and "acceptable" collateral property damage.
Captured and held prisoner on Empress Teta during the Krath Revivalist Rebellion, where he resisted psychological and physical torture for nearly two months before escaping with the help of his prisoner's loincloth, a multi-tool fashioned from a plastoid spork, and a small army of indigenous womprats that he trained during his time of bondage.
**Personality:** Efficient, ruthless, and unpredictable are the best ways to describe Kaz Krieger. Known for getting the job done in a variety of unconventional ways, Kaz has a great many psychological dysfunctions that hodge-podge together to form a functional whole. The man follows a code of honor known only to him that is liable to change with any given situation or mental quirk currently afflicting the mercenary.
**You Ended Up Here Because …**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

*ExplorCorps Headquarters, two months prior to the expedition.*
**"Ah, thank you for coming mister…"**
The sharp rasp of metal on stone reverberates in the small conference room, causing each member of the three-sentient interview committee to grind their teeth, or appropriate organ. Kaz Krieger sat on an arm-less chair across a table from the review panel, sharpening his field knife on a whetstone and seeming a great deal more concerned with that work rather than his interview.
**"Krieger."
"…Roight… Mister Krieger. As I was saying, thank you for coming. As you may know, we are interviewing candidates who have put themselves forward for our new Deep Space Exploration initiative…"**
Kaz looks up slightly to affix the speaker with an indolent glance, and then returns his attention to his sharpening. The interviewer clears his throat before continuing.
**"Yes… Well, you come highly regarded mister Krieger, except… We have a few questions about some of your psychological evaluations we have here…"
"Mhmph. Never been one much for tests."**
***Ssshickt… Ssshickt… Ssshickt…***
From the way that the light gleamed off the edge of the combat knife, it was obvious that the blade did not require any further sharpening. Still, the mercenary continued his honing and scraping, honing and scraping, without nary a glance or concern for the others in the room. The intensity of Kaz's focus on the menial work and the almost loving gaze he has for the knife begins to cause a degree of disquiet amongst his interviewers.
**"I can, eh… sympathize with that, Erm… Yes! Well I believe our biggest concern comes in with your apparent, *ahem*, disdain for… wearing *pants*?"**
The metallic rasp halts suddenly, and the interviewers catch their breath as Kaz's head slowly swings towards them, a feverish look to his eye. Posting his elbow on his knee, the mercenary begins to gesture in lazy circles at the panel members, every eye drawn to the shining tip of the mad man's knife.
**"You ever wrestle a Dxun Purple Python?"
"I can not say that I have…"
"They just kriffin' *love* pants. Crawl up in'm to keep warm withcha, right before they fuse to your leg. Then it's bye-bye urethra!"
"That is… most unfortunate, but sir we- "
"Every man I've ever killed was wearing pants, or a pants-like contraption, doesn't that tell you somethin'?! Except the Wookies… But they're just like giant, walkin' pairs of pants, but with *less* teeth…"**
Kaz stares wild-eyed at the interviewer, causing the man to splutter. The mercenary takes the gasping for words as an affirmation of his point, as he nods knowingly to himself. Throwing up his hands, the interviewer points an accusatory finger at Kaz, his fellows nodding in agreement.
**"B-but… But mister Krieger, you are currently wearing pants! Upon you, just this moment, are the pants that you so highly despise!"**
Smiling in victory, Kaz stabs the dagger at the speaker, causing the three to take a step back even though the mercenary sat a couple of meters away from them.
**"Ah, you notice that eh? Keep your friends close and your enemies closer, and I aims to keep mine *real* close. Way I wear my sonsuvakriffers, I violate'm at every turn. Let those bastards know you mean business!"**
The interviewers share confused looks for a moment, before understanding blooms on each face, rapidly followed by a queasy uneasiness... Except for one of the interviewers, she makes a mental not to take down Kaz's comm number, for a possible dinner date later.
Clearing his throat, the main interviewer makes a pretense of shifting the flimsiplast documents in his hand, using it as an excuse to not look the psychotic mercenary in the eye as he speaks.
**"Ah… Yes, well… This has been most enlightening… We, uh…, we will be in touch should you be selected. D-do not contact us back unless we contact you first, as it will, erm… disrupt the selection process? Quite! It would disrupt the selection process. G-good bye, mr. Krieger, and may the Force save you."**
Kaz gives the interviewer's the thumbs-up before he leaps to his feet. Twirling the sharpened combat knife around his thumb, he slides it into his sheath and spins on a heel to depart the room. Just before he does, he does a rather awkward looking shaking-jig in his pants and then gives a knowing, conspirator's glance over his shoulder before marching out.
The interviewers sit in stunned silence for a long time, before any further interviews for the day were canceled.

## Re: Into the Unknown (open)

### **Frost** (2010-09-02 23:12:14)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Viktor Shesh</span>**
Sex: Male Race: Human Age: 26
**Brief Background:**
Born to an aristocratic lifestyle, Viktor was born to the noble family of Shesh on his homeworld of Kuat. From the time he was very young, he was educated and trained to carry on the family legacy of engineering and ship design. A career that suited he gifted mechanical mind and one in which he took great pleasure in. Despite his noble heritage, Viktor started out as an entry level engineer and soon worked himself up to be the assistant of Elina Gretily, one of the fast movers in Kuat Drive Yards. Her work was truly cutting edge for her time and she had chosen Viktor as her primary assistant.
They worked very closely for a number of years and he learned amazing new and innovative concepts and ideas from her. Thought he learned much from her, Viktor came to know the bitter sting of betrayal. He had been working on a project of his own in secret for some time. He was going to be his crowning achievement as a Kuat engineer. A revolutionary new prototype hyper drive, which he was going aptly name the “Elina Mark I”. Viktor was very naive then, and being the trusting fool that he was, he brought the designs to Elina, seeking her approval on his most prized possession. Elina was duly impressed, but also secretly envious; she feared that this engineer’s assistant would soon eclipse her own reputation she had built in the shipyards. When the opportunity presented itself, she stole a copy of his plans and started building her own prototype based his design schematics. With Viktor out of the picture, she would be free to claim the work as her own, so she set her mind to discredit his character by sabotaging one of his most important jobs: the repair work on Republic senator’s personal shuttle. The disaster left him disgraced and he subsequently banished from the Kuat shipyards due to scandalous mistake. For a months,he wandered around the galaxy performing odd jobs and cursing his luck and Elina’s ‘good fortune’. This continued for some time until he discovered a new passion for exploration.
**Past Adventures:**
His first assignment with the ExplorCorps was an emergency repair for a scout vessel that had skimmed the gravitational well of a black hole. The whole mission had been a race against time to try and save the vessel before it was sucked into the event horizon. This was Viktor’s first taste of the exhilarating thrill of the dangers of deep space exploration. He was hooked like a junkie on death sticks. Soon, he was requesting assignment after assignment, taking him farther and farther into Unknown Regions, hoping each to discover and learn about the lost civilizations of the universe.
**Personality:**
Viktor tends to be a little manic depressive. During his manic phase, he needs little sleep, being that he is solely driven to work and create. His creativity and energy are at their highest; on occasion he has been known to tear down and rebuild hyper drives in just one day! Other times during his melancholy phase, he becomes withdrawn, reclusive and even appearing to be sad. When he is experiencing this depression, he has been known to stay in his bunks for days on end, preferring not converse or interact with the other crew members. On his good days, he is a bit of a technophile; he has hunger to understand the inner workings of machines and anything mechanical. He enjoys building and repairing all manner of machines and electronic devices; he has a need to comprehend their function, and see their inner workings. What he loves even more than anything else is taking normal components and making them better with his inventive upgrades and unique modifications. In that respect, Viktor is not an engineer, but an artist, with the blue prints as his canvas and working parts/components, his paint. Viktor has yet to ‘paint’ his masterpiece, but when he does, the galaxy will marvel at his creation…
**You Ended Up Here Because …**
Viktor has insatiable wanderlust; he wants to see the more and more of the galaxy and will do anything to get as far away from Kuat and the core worlds as he can. Viktor seems to be right at home as a simple freighter engineer/mechanic on a humble unknown region bound freighter than some obstreperous corporate wage slave who would be toiling away at a factory in the core systems, any day of the year.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Tussk</span>**
Male Trandoshan 25
**Brief Background:** Born with the gift of the Force, somewhat uncommon among the Trandoshan species, Tussk was taken to the Jedi Temple to be trained as a Jedi. It became clear pretty soon though that he was not the material for a knight, partly because of a weak connection to the Force, and partly due to his hot temper. No matter how much they tried to erase it, he always kept his innate hunter instincts, and finally the day came when he had to leave the Order, as the Council had deemed that his path was not to be that of the Jedi Knight. Instead, he was sent to join the Jedi Exploration Corps.
There he has now spent most of his life, traveling across the Galaxy, exploring new planets and uncovering hidden secrets. While most of his Jedi training has faded, he keeps some of it close at heart, and has also developed an unusual ability to sense the subtle currents of the Force caused by all forms of natural beasts and creatures, making him a gifted scout and explorer.
**Past Adventures:** Tussk has traveled across the Galaxy working for the Exploration Corps, and even though most expeditions are uneventful, he have found himself in a few tight spots down the road. Whether it be aggressive beasts, unexpected natural hazards, or even less-than-friendly natives, they can all cause trouble for unaware explorers. Cautious explorers, like Tussk, are the ones who are still around to tell such tales.
**Personality:** Like most of his species, Tussk have strong natural hunter instincts, as well as a short temper. He is in no way stupid, though he is brash and blunt, and prefers simple and effective solutions to problems. If his allies stands around thinking about how to clear a collapsed cave, Tussk is likely to just grab the boulders and start heaving them away. He also possesses – although not spectacular – Force abilities, where his most distinctive talent is to see through the wild currents of the Force even where the senses of others would be blinded by the sheer amount of life energies (such as on Felucia).
**You Ended Up Here Because …** Working for the Exploration Corps, Tussk was sent along on the expedition to aid as a tracker and scout.

### **Blackhat** (2010-09-04 01:19:20)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Dard Onnirr</span>**
Male Human 27
**Brief Background:** Rumoured to be the illegitimate love child of two respected and allegedly rival political agendas by the medical staff on hand who were busy signing wavers, Dard Onnirr began his life on Delaya as confusingly as was possible in hindsight. He was constantly being shuffled about the child-care wards of hospitals and then later orphanages and care-centers, always falling just short of appointments with a family who was sure to take him in by "scheduling errors" and "travel anomalies". It was these quirky little phenomenons sent down from on high constantly surrounding the child for years that led him to be considered with animosity by the ever-changing faces that were to care for him until he was moved about the circuit again.
That was until one enterprising socially minded administrative assistant simply left the doors unlocked and prayed to the purple people eater in the sky that fate would get a little hands on; it was for the child's sake of course. Growing increasingly aware of the minimal impact his choices made on his life, Dard Orrinn made a break for it and joined the enterprising throngs of street children and petty thieves before turning into a successful young narc.
Now in what some might call the prime of his professional career as someone who takes thing you wish to be private and making them not, Dard Works as an Investigative Journalist for The Galactic Herald and is considered the silver standard for candid fact-finding by Holonet surfers with a paranoid fear of "legitimate" interstellar journalism.
**Past Adventures:** Recently Mr. Onnirr was led by a trusted source to the juicily shocking discovery of a shipyard under commission by the Republic, known as Par'Tasti Manufacturing, that was replacing high-quality engine and weapon components with those of the lowest bidder and moving them onto the Black Market in an effort to pad profit margins and gain more contracts in which to also skim parts from. Practically bombarded by fraudulent shipping manifests, falsified payrolls, inventory discrepancies, willing whistle-blowers, and personal emails practically spelling-out Par'Tasti Manufacturing's illegal activities, Dard got on the fast track of compiling it all and putting and article together before he was scooped. Confident that an exclusive exposé would follow immediately after it's submission and lost in romanticized notions of his future success, he was completely blind-sided when, shortly after it's syndicated release and an abundant amount of rabble-rousing, every single shred of his evidence turned out to be fabricated and every source disappeared never to be seen again. To make matters infinitely worse, the shipyard in question didn't actually exist in the first place, as enthusiasm for the project and selfish ambition on the part of his employers had left them to neglect actually confirming the site beyond it's entry on the Holonet and registry in the Galactic Business Bureau by proxy or otherwise.
The public outrage at the apparent completely incompetent oversight of TGH was a more appealing story to the galactic readership than the article that prompted it could have ever been, a fact that the other members of the interstellar press quickly jumped on top of wholeheartedly. The people in charge of the oversight in question were just as quick to dump the incident and all connotations that went along with it unceremoniously on the shoulders of Dard Onnirr.
**Personality:** Inquisitive with a new-found professional respect for caution and self-awareness, Dard is constantly analyzing the things and people around him. He has little restraint in asking questions on matters others would find needlessly awkward, and will address things of a similar fashion head-on when confronted with them should unforeseen events strip him of the chance. Prone to alternate lines of thinking that are just as purposely terrible and ridiculous as they are accidentally terrible and ridiculous, he prides himself on taking the never-in-a-million-years traveled path in order to hopefully stumble upon genius while others are bound by practicality. Having humour as his one and only coping mechanism, as well as an irritatingly upbeat demeanor in situations where it is not always appropriate, have added to the already dross-covered stigma his particular brand of profession generates.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** In the resulting boisterous and strangely ruthless backlash upon himself and his associated publishing concerns for their pathetically sloppy journalistic protocols, his superiors thought it appropriate to distance themselves, while not wishing to set him loose to turn his "Journalistic Integrity" and possible revenge-seeking back their way. When the call for volunteers for a deep space expedition reached TGH Administration they naturally felt it was their duty to make sure such a momentous event was catalogs to the best of their potential, if only to enable a better turn-out the next time something similar was attempted. An hour later Dard Onnirr was granted his press commission for the "Thorough documentation of the ExploCorp/Republic Co-Venture with no time constraints" and was ferried with all manner of haste while their legal staff tirelessly ironed out the paperwork for all things concerned.

Is there a reason the weapon increases by 1d damage? PBS gives you a +1 to the attack and to the damage modifier, not 1d. So with PBS you get +7 atk, 2d6+4 damage. Normally +6 atk, 2d6+3 damage.
Improved Accuracy is giving you a +1 to attack, not +2.
Edit: I'm now aware that Sport Hunter gives you the +1d, but the above should still be taken into consideration, but the PBS stats don't need to be included on your sheet.
Also I believe you are missing a language slot, unless your race doesn't get basic for free. You should have 4 from INT mod and 5 from linguist in addition to your racial languages.
I have given the option to leave a number unassigned = to 1/4 rounded down. As you get 9 additional languages you can leave 2 unassigned.
Considering the cultures of the Rakata and the Mandalorians I hope you have a good reason for knowing their languages fluently.

I am planning on working those languages into my character's background since he has a keen interest in past civilizations. If you'd rather me not, though, I can pick some others. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
EDIT:I listed the PB because of the Sport Hunter feat, not the PBS feat. BA +4, Dex +2, Improved Accuracy +1 - no bonus to attack at PB, just damage. Sorry for the confusion.

**Personality:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Bran is a quiet and introspective sort, who often proffers the company of his Varg over other sentients. Those who persevere and break through his shell find a warm, thoughtful soul.

</details>

**Background**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Born in the culture of the Hedd system, Bran is a natural hunter and wilderness guide. His family was poorer, so much of their income and sustenance came from hunting and trapping. A resident of Hedd, he was raised alongside the Varg, learning to trust and respect their strength and to form the bond that comes naturally to the people of that system. He named his Varg Ferro, Iron, for its strength and nobility. He received basic military training on Cadair O Daionus, learning to fight from Varg-back and to handle a variety of weapons. Realizing that living off the mountain wasn't what he wanted from life he left, and found that wilderness varied greatly from planet to planet, but nature didn't. No matter where he found himself, so long he was in the wild, he was at home. Soon he found that the mass of knowledge that he took as common sense was very valuable. He made enough to keep himself equipped and traveling easily, and spent the rest on his Varg. He eventually took a contract he would come to regret. Ashcorp offered him a large sum to scout planets and record data for their research units. He was happy to do so, until the day he returned to a planet he had scouted for them previously. He found the ecosystem decimated and the wilderness gone, stripped for resources. He thought of lying to them on future trips, returning with bad data, but his honesty and sense of honor wouldn't allow it. He decided to refuse them the recent data, and expose their exploiting of worlds. When he tried to leave he was accused of breaching his contract, which they attempted to answer with force. Bran proved a difficult target for bounty hunters, especially on the wilder worlds where he stayed. When the opportunity arose to join the exploration, he made haste to sign up knowing his skills would be well used and that the mission would protect him from Ashcorp's infinite resources.

</details>

**Description**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Bran stands roughly 1.9 meters tall and weighs around 100 kilos. His hair is a dark, rich brown and very thick, worn long and often tied back to keep it from his eyes, which are a pale bluish gray. His body is hard but not overly muscular, simply well trained in surviving harsh conditions. His hands are scarred from his years in the wild, and his body bears the signs of many a beast's claws and teeth. His face is mostly planes, angles, and hard lines, much like the mountains of his homeworld. Thin eyebrows ride the crag that is his brow, and he keeps his face clean shaven when he can.
His constant companion and closest confidant is Ferro, a massive lupine creature. It stands almost 2 meters tall at the shoulder, and is longer than that from hip to snout. It weighs close to a 500 kilos, and is covered in thick dark fur, save for its large clawed paws and belly, which are a dirty gray. (think wolf the size of a Clydesdale)

Aloof and arogant, Ashlow is often hard to talk to unless you are talking to him about one of his passions, namely sciences and hunting.

</details>

**Background**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ashlow's inteligence began showing when he was a toddler when he displayed fluency in several languages. It continued to grow with his first Doctorate at the age of twelve. By the age 16, he had mastered many medical sciences and had become an accomplished surgeon. By eighteen, his mastery of science and medicine was combined with a business logic to create the company AshCorp, which quickly grew to gargantuan purportions. His wealth was immesurable by the age of 25, and the bounds of his knowledge were still expanding. At 30, finding no challenge left in medicine, science, or business he took up hunting. Leaving his companies he travelled all around the galaxy, hunting the most dangerous and elusive game. On a safari on Sriluur, his guide had a Dark Wolf for protection and tracking. After examining the beast and observing it in the field Ashlow found himself enamored of the beasts, and spent two years on Sriluur training a pack of them. During the next six years he and his pack of dark wolves have brought down a variety of the galaxy's most vicious beasts. Since leaving he has had practically no contact with his corporation, having left it in the hands of a Board of Directors. He simply draws from his personal accounts on most known worlds, his fortune being beyond description and constantly growing. His ship, *The Hunter in Darkness* a large frigate, is decorated with his trophies from successful hunts, and contains a variety of smaller craft used on his trips. One of which, an Arrow-23 Landspeeder, he decides to take with him on this expedition, along with one of his multitude of droids, a FA-5 valet, to pilot it and perform menial tasks.

</details>

**Description**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ashlow Arkham stands 1.7 meters tall and weighs roughly 70 kilos. He has soft, well cared for skin, white hair worn long more from lack of concern than intention, and the typical solid white eyes and four digit hands of his species. The last eight years haven't been kind to his hands, which have handled the abuse badly after so many years of protection. He typically wears elegant robes while at leasure or in company, but in the field he wears a wide brimmed hat and much plainer clothing consisting of tough boots and cargo-style pants, with a thick shirt and a many pocketed jacket. In his personal quarters or the field his constant companions are his wolves, dark leathery skinned lupine beasts with vicious claws, teeth, and cruelly barbed tails. Alway near is his valet droid, who has standing orders to not be seen but be within listening distance.

Magic. Think of this realistically.
You're going on a long term voyage with no idea of what to expect as far as what planets you'll come across and resources.
How don you plan to take care of the multitude of creatures you wish your characters to have?
Where are they going to be housed on the ship which could potentially house only up to 10?
How might your fellow crew feel being stuck with these creatures days and weeks on end with possibly no relief as a you explore systems?
These are only a small mulitude of questions. Yes animals are cool, but they are creatures with their own wants and needs like your character, which needs to be taken into consideration before such a voyage.
Also your level 1 abilities don't match with your level 6 you should look into and correct that

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-09-16 12:55:33)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">ACE-1</span>**
Male Programmed Field Assistant Droid
**Brief Background:** While the company have scored enough success with their R-series of astromech droids, Industrial Automaton knows that every successful company must constantly evolve and upgrade their productivity. As such, the ACE prototype was designed in an attempt to provide assistance to field operatives (civilian as well as military) beyond the scope of what an astromech droid can offer. Based loosely upon the R-series, ACE design revolves around providing a versatile field unit capable of assisting in a multitude of tasks. Whereas specialized assistance packages can be purchased for different applications, the idea is for all units to keep at least a basic functionality and be able to cover a large basis of emergency situations such as repairs, broadcasting emergency signals, field survival, first aid and similar skills.
The ACE-1 is one of a few prototypes manufactured by IA for field testing their new design. With a relatively high manufacturing cost and yet largely untested capacity, IA executives sought it best to assign a small number of units to various assignments across the galaxy to evaluate their performance. ACE-1 was assigned to a soon-to-be launched expedition arranged by the Republic, and has been equipped and programmed for this task.
**Past Adventures:** As a prototype unit, ACE-1 has not been on any prior adventures as such, though his programming is based upon that of the R-series, and the stories of pilots having their days saved by their reliable astromech droids are quite a few.
**Personality:** Programmed for service and assistance, the ACE unit is always willing to assist others, doing so to the best of its ability. The droid is of a very talkative nature, sometimes excessively so, and has developed a great (although rather odd at times) sense of humor.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** Field Testing, as part of a series of about a dozen units built and equipped for specific tasks by IA.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Sweitt Gregoran</span>**
Male Vurk 35
**Brief Background:** Sweitt Gregorani was born on Sembla, when he came of age, he left the planet to wander he Galaxy. Just like the rest of his people, Sweitt is a nomad at heart, and loves to travel to new places and see new things. Being born a pretty strong individual, he found job as personal security for a traveling merchant, which suited him perfectly. The man wasn´t really the kind of merchant you except to get into trouble, and the job allowed Sweitt to see many new places.
Not being able to stay with doing the same thing for more than about a year though, Sweitt managed to get transferred into the Republic army, taking job as a field assistance worker. This job required him to assist with reconstruction efforts after natural disasters, mediate in local disputes, and assist in search and rescue operations, among others. A variable job, which took him to many places, was just what he needed.
**Past Adventures:** Sweitt has been present at the sites of many natural disasters, and helped to rebuild destroyed property or find missing people. A natural amphibian, he has taken part in many operations on oceanic planets such as Manaan and Mon Calamari. He has developed a talent for handling a gun, though mostly to keep predators at bay. What he has really found useful though is how he has learned to handle and maintain a wide range of equipmeny including explosives, climbing gear, smaller vehicles, and various sensor equipment.
**Personality:** Sweitt is a calm individual, and it sometimes seems as nothing gets him upset. Though that is not entirely true, he is very good at not showing it on the outside. His nomadic spirit keeps him constantly wanting to wander into new territories and explore new fields of expertise, though with his years he has come to be a bit more content with what he have at the moment. As an experienced mediator and calmer of panicked people, he has a friendly and cheerful manner, and if he has doubts or worries, he usually keeps them inside not to worry anyone unless it´s necessary.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** An expedition into unknown space was too appealing to Sweitt´s nomadic spirit, and he simply couldn´t resist the urge to go. Being a longtime employee of the Republic´s, it wasn´t that hard to convince the right people to let him tag along. They weren´t 100% clear on what role he would fill on the expedition, so it is possible they sent him along just to get him to stop nagging them about it.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Camden Usher</span>**
Male Human 23
**Brief Background:** Camden was born on Coruscant, where he was found by the Jedi Order at a young age, though his parents would refuse the Jedi to take their son away from them. They never told him about the event, and since he was too young to remember when it happened, Cam grew up just like a regular boy. His parents ran a small-time business and he was raised so that he would be able to join the family company when he grew up, and as such he was given a very extensive formal education. The young boy did not object to this, and he proved to have an unsatisfiable thirst for knowledge.
One day though, a few wrong words slipped from his mother, and upon questioning them, his parents spilled the secret to him. Not really angry or upset with them, Cam was nevertheless very disappointed at not having been able to be a part of the Jedi Order. He thirsted for knowledge, and loved to explore and uncover new mysteries, and what greater mystery could there be than the mysterious power of the Jedi Knights?
Knowing full well he would never be accepted for training at his age, his parents tried to convince him to just remain on the path he had been set upon in life, though Cam would have none of it. If not the Jedi would teach him, someone else would, he reasoned. Feeling a bit guilty, his parents did nothing more to hold him back, and soon Cam left on his own to try and find ways to learn about the Force.
Upon investigating the matter, Cam heard rumors of a tradition of Force users on the Draethos homeworld of Thosa, and decided to travel there. With a charming and persuasive personality, Cam was able to convince the members of the Keetael to give him basic instructions in using the Force. He remained on Thosa for just above a year, and then decided to take his leave. He has since traveled the Galaxy, finding other people that can offer him more knowledge about the Force.
**Past Adventures:** Convincing people normally reluctant to do so to train you in the ways of the Force is not an easy thing. To get the approval of the Keetael, Cam had to prove himself as a hunter by felling one of the most dangerous predators on Thosa. Not in anyway skilled at such tasks, it was mostly his quick mind in combination with dumb luck hat saw him through that day. Other people he has visited has demanded similar trials, but as his skill with the Force has grown they have become easier to conquer.
**Personality:** Cam has a very persuasive nature, and is skilled at convincing other to see his point. He has a great thirst for knowledge, and even after completing the education his parents put him through in his early years, he has continued to search for knowledge as he traveled across the Galaxy. In terms of using the Force, he stands as rather neutral, not really seeing the Force as means to any specific ends, but rather as something to be explored and understood.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** An expedition such as this held great promise of uncovering new and lost knowledge, and possibly finding ancient artifacts of the Force. Convincing the right people to send him along as a knowledgeable resource, he hasn´t widely announced his connection to the Force, though he doesn´t go out of his way to hide it either.

Made a slight addendum to the Rule Changes. I somehow missed there was already a Soldier talent called Armor Mastery so I have changed the name for the combined AD and IAD to *Armored Defense Mastery*.
Sorry to anyone who has taken this.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;"> Melashi &quot;Mel&quot; Krystel </span>**
Female Arkanian 45
**Brief Background:**The Krystel family owned a mining corporation on the planet Arkania. With the precious materials being mined, Melashi’s family was very wealthy. Melashi was well educated, sent to the best schools that her family’s wealth could buy.
Although Melashi has not travelled off the planet until she was 19, she enjoyed her leisure time riding tauntauns across the icy landscape. When she finished her studies, she wanted to travel and meet new people. So with her family’s money, her education and family connections, she set off to Coruscant.
**Past Adventures:** With Melashi’s educated background, she was quickly assigned in office as an assistant Ambassador. Travelling to different planets and meeting new people, she quickly applied her knowledge and intellect in negotiations. After many years, she worked her way up and became an Ambassador for the senate by the age of 30.
**Personality:**Mel’s first impression when you meet her is a stuck-up snob. You can quickly deduct that she comes from a wealthy upper class family. Her education shows when she speaks to you, always using proper grammar and her knowledge of various topics. She always stands tall with proper posture and would rather defuse a situation with her words.
**You Ended Up Here Because …**The Senate has assigned Melashi a new mission on a planet on the outta rim. The mission was highly classified and was ordered to not to use her usual methods of transport to the planet.
Upon finding out the details of the classified mission, Melashi sought out a ship that was heading in her direction. She passed herself off as a scientist rather than an Ambassador as to throw off suspicion.

Looks like you're still take character concepts. If so, I'd like to submit the following.
Looks like a fun campaign!
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Lan Kosar</span>**
Male Human 23
**Brief Background:**
Lan Kosar was born on the planet Naboo, where he would live the first six years of his life. He spent those years in a rural village in the hill country far from the planet's urban centers. His fellow villagers missed the signs of his force sensitivity; his hours spent in wandering the nearby hills and deep in meditation set him apart as unusual but not extraordinary. Instead he was thought to be just a particularly sensitive child. It was not until Lan's family traveled to the Theed palace seeking tax relief that Kosar's true potential was discovered by Kel Dor Jedi Quin Tar. He was trained on Coruscant to be a Jedi; in particular his training emphasized diplomacy, biology, and galactic history.
**Past Adventures:**
As a padawan, Lan was involved in a number of negotiations that brought outer rim worlds into the Republic. Some who witnessed these sessions have said that on at least one occasion his arguments may have been the decisive factor, although Kosar scrupulously gives all credit to his master, famed consular Quin Tar. The bulk of his experience has been as a diplomat and an explorer; growing up in a small village relatively untouched by violence, he is a pacifist and is loathe to draw his saber. As such, his combat experience is minimal. Although he has been involved in a number of small skirmishes, there were those on the Jedi Council who felt that his promotion would be premature, that he was not battle-hardened.
**Personality:**
Kosar is extremely reserved; he is prone to extended observation of social situations before speaking his carefully considered response. As such, he earns respect much quicker than he earns affection. The few that do get to know him discover a sly sense of humor that is often lost on casual acquaintances.
His force sensitivity first manifested itself as an extreme awareness of the connection between all living things and empathy with suffering in all its forms. Before he learned to control his feelings he was subject to prolonged periods of intense grief over the suffering of others: even those that others would call lesser beings or beasts.
**You Ended Up Here Because …**
The combination of his skills in diplomacy and biology made him a natural for the Jedi Exploratory Corps. As soon as he learned of this mission he immediately volunteered. The thought of getting away from the sterile environments of the core worlds and out into unexplored territory thrilled him beyond measure.

## Re: [RotE] Into the Unknown (OPEN!, still taking apps)

### **Anonymous** (2010-11-27 16:54:11)

**BACKGROUND:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Rev and Marly Kosar were descended from families of the original human colonists on Naboo, or so they liked to claim to travelers at their inn. If pressed it's unlikely either could have proven it. Yet it's certainly true that although not one of the great noble families of Naboo, the Kosars had been witness to much of Naboo's history over the years. Rev was often heard to say that "Jafan may have united Naboo, but it was Kosars who fed his soldiers, Kosars who paved his streets and Kosars who filled his coffers."
The Kosar brothers grew up in Theed and would have stayed there until they died, were it not for Marly's unfortunate lack of discretion when it came to romantic pursuits. When he was 17, Marly impregnated the daughter of a prominent local merchant. Ignoring his daughter's pleas and Marly's offers to marry his daughter or provide for her and her child, the merchant pulled every string he knew, called in every favor. Although he wasn't able to get Marly arrested, as he'd committed no crime, he did see to it that the Kosar brothers were blackballed -- there was no work to be had for either young man in Theed form that day forward.
And so it was that the Kosar brothers, along with Rev's young wife Naja, moved far from Theed, to a small village by a lake long rumored to have healing properties. There they opened an inn and cantina, hoping to draw in tourists and off-worlders. Of course, the lake's healing properties amounted to fresh air and water kept nice and hot by it's connection to Naboo's underground waterways, but the Kosars managed to bring in enough patrons to keep themselves in business.
Six years after their flight from Theed, Naja and Rev welcome the birth of their first child, Lan. From the time he could walk, Lan was a child of the outdoors, fussy and impatient when confined to the inn. He would spent hours walking the shore of the lake, or sitting by its shore in quiet meditation. He seemed to empathize with all living things, whether flora or fauna, and was subject to bouts of grief as he was overcome with the suffering he felt around him. Naja worried that he was becoming anti-social spending so much time to himself, and so was delighted when he befriended a young Gungan named Keelee. (Rev was less thrilled with this development, fearing that it would draw Lan even further way from normal behavior).
Everything changed, however, when Lan was six, nearly seven years old. A satisfied traveler returning to Theed from the Kosar's inn told an acquaintance of his stay -- unfortunately for the Kosars, this friend was the merchant who'd once driven them from Theed. Never one to forget a grudge, the merchant was furious to hear of their success. Calling on his sister in the tax assessor's office, he arranged for the inn to be re-valued, placing an enormous financial burden on the Kosar family. Unaware of the merchants role in their misfortune, the Kosar family closed the inn and traveled to Theed to plead for relief.
Although their mission was unsuccessful, the journey would change young Lan's life. It was there they encountered Quin Tar, a Kel Dor Jedi Knight visiting Naboo. Lan, it seems, was strong in the force, a fact which Quin Tar felt as soon as Lan entered the city. Lan never returned to the inn, going instead with Quin Tar to Coruscant for training as his Padawan.
In the years to come Lan would be very conscious of the fact that his entire life had been shaped by two men of no relation to him. One he shadowed for years studying under him and serving by his side. The other he never met, yet his influence was equally important. Were it not for the merchant's rage at a slight to his honor, Lan would never have been surrounded by the beauty of the Naboo countryside and allowed to see his place in the natural order. And it was that same rage that brought him to Theed to put him on his path as a Jedi. The lesson, he believed was that "when you strike at a man in anger, you strike at the entire community that surrounds him; unless you act as one with the force your actions may echo through history with effects you never dreamt or desired."
He also thought of his cousin, his Uncle Marly's illegitimate daughter. She would be only a few years older than him. How was her life shaped by her grandfather's rage? What had she become?

</details>

**PAST ADVENTURES;**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

As a Jedi, Lan was a pacifist. Although he'd come to recognize suffering as an inherent fact of life, no more eradicable than the night, he still saw the Jedi's duty, first and foremost, in it's alleviation. In this he was the ideal padawan for the diplomat Quin Tar. Quin Tar taught him that "the most successful Jedi is the one that, though always in the field, has never drawn his lightsaber." Together they were involved in a number of notable diplomatic resolutions.
On Abraxas, the two settled a labor dispute that had brought mining operations to a standstill and threatened to devolve into open violence. When a prison riot on Kessel led to the capture of several guards, Quin Tar and Lan negotiated for the release of the hostages, all while under the threat of Hutt intervention. When Seswanna and Eriadu teetered on the brink of war over trade relations, the pair successfully bartered a truce. Of this last especially, some witnesses have claimed that it was Kosar's words in particular that stirred the hearts of the people of Seswenna. For his part, Kosar has always been scrupulous in deferring all credit to his master.

</details>

**PERSONALITY:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Kosar is extremely reserved; he is prone to extended observation of social situations before speaking his carefully considered response. As such, he earns respect much quicker than he earns affection. The few that do get to know him discover a sly sense of humor that is often lost on casual acquaintances.
His nature, as well as his upbringing, have meant that the phrase "lesser being" is not in Lan's vocabulary. Whether sentient species or beast of burden, he believes that all beings through which the force flow are one -- and therefore when you harm or disrespect any, you harm all. Consequently he is a vegetarian.

</details>

**YOU ENDED UP HERE BECAUSE…**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Quin Tar was unsurprised when Lan volunteered for the exploratory mission. Despite the years, Lan had never grown out of his dislike of urban life and discomfort with being cooped up in buildings. The thought of traveling along the fringes of the galaxy, seeing strange new vistas, and putting his diplomatic skills to the test surely thrilled him. Nevertheless he urged him to reconsider.
"Kosar, I understand why this mission appeals to you, and I will feel no ill will towards you if you choose to go. Yet, I must, for the sake of my own conscience say to you what surely you've already thought about. You don't know what situations you'll encounter. Your skills as a negotiator are extraordinary -- why travel to the outer rim, knowing not what needs might exist, when there is so much good to be done in known space?"
Kosar observed his master for a long moment before responding. Although Quin Tar's eyes were blocked by goggles, Kosar had known him enough years that he had little trouble reading his attitude. "Master Quin Tar, I know you still see in me the anti-social child you discovered on Naboo who wanted nothing better than to spend his days alone by the shore in quiet stillness. I suppose in some ways I still am that child, but I take this step as an adult -- as a Jedi, not simply out of wanderlust. Besides, if we never act for fear that somewhere there is something bigger, something more important we might do, we're powerless to act at all. If my nature calls me to explore the uncharted space should I fight against it? Can we be one with the force if we are not one with ourselves?"
Lan knew, despite the mask hiding it, that Quin Tar had smiled at that. "Very well, my friend, then may the force be with you."

Make sure to put Jedi 6 here: "Medium Male Human (Naboo) 6"
Add Strong in the Force, Force Boon to the end of the line of DP 6; FP 11; Dark Side 0;
With Int of 14, you get 2 languages plus your racial. Take one more language or add to end of line: (1 unassigned)
Defenses Ref 19 (flat footed 17), Fort 18, Will 21; Dodge

Reflex= 10 + 6 level + 1 Jedi class + 2 dex (flat footed subtract dex and dodge bonus)
Fort= 10 + 6 level + 1 Jedi class + 1 con
Will= = 10 + 6 level + 1 Jedi class + 4 wis
**Melee** by weapon +6 (+3) - For damage you include 1/2 level + str
**Ranged** by weapon +8 (+3)
So Lightsaber should actually be
**Melee** lightsaber +7 (2d8+3) - you forgot to include Weapon Focus
Force Perception talent is a prereq for Psychometry
Missing Racial Skill.
Remember that as per errata Acrobatic Strike gives only a +2 attack bonus.
Master Negotiator can be considered a Special Action
