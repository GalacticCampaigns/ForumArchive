# [SAGA OR] Holocron Hunters (Casting Call - Open)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Holocron Hunters</span>
<span style="font-size: 0.85em;">Survival is easy, profitting from it&amp;#8230;that&amp;#39;s the hard part.</span>
</div>

**"So you want in on our little game do ya?"**
The deep, heavy breathing, mechanical voice came from a fur covered Bimm, his feet resting on the table in front of him as he balanced his weight in his chair. His face was hard to distinguish partly due to the wide brimmed hat pulled down in front of it, and partly due to the cybernetic implants he had where his mouth was. He sucked on a large cigarra and blew a plume of thick smoke from between his stained lips before going over the spiel with the wirey-looking human in front of him:
**"You know the risks?"**
**"Yes, but I had one que—"**
**"No "buts," no "questions. We clear?"** He said, his fingers forming the punctuation as he spoke, ash tumbling from the end of his cigarra as he did. **"That's one strike, three of those and you're outta the game…and that's unpleasant. So…next, have you got the entry fee?"**
**"About that, I only mana—"**
**"Strike Number Two"** The Bimm said, holding up his hand to display one and a half fingers. His other hand now pointing a concealed blaster at his new recruit. **"So how much do you have?"**
**"Nine thousand"** The human said, throwing his credit chip to the Bimm.
The furry creatured sucked it's brown pointed teeth before speaking again. **"That's a full one thousand creds short."** There was a long pause as he examined the chip, then a brilliant flash of red. **"…Unacceptable. Strike Three."**
He signalled to the two Gamorrean by the office door, who dragged the body away behind them. He shouted after them: **"Send the next one in!"**

Holocron Hunters is a brutal adventure that balances teamwork against individualistic behaviour. (You want others to (help you) achieve the target, but you want the prize to yourself). You and a band of competitors are racing to hit a 500 point target. You can form alliances, groups or just go it alone. The game will be split into seasons, after an alloted period of time in the game, the season will end and players (NPCs and PCs alike) who don't make the cut for that season will be kicked out of the game, their possessions taken and put on sale for the others to buy.
Progress is tracked by the event organisers' credit system (A nickle sized blood red token with HH emblazoned on both sides). 1 HH = 10,000cr and these can be bought at various locations in game after it has started. They can also be sold for information and parts for your ships. Loot from treasure hunting can be sold to the HH Corporation (event organisers) directly for HH tokens or privately for creds and then later traded for HH. (You may get a better deal if you go private).
It's entirely up to you how you play it. Every action will have a reaction somewhere down the line. Do you want to sell what you find to the HH Corporation or will you sell it to private buyers or donate it to a centre of learning. Do you want to win the competition and get the mystery prize? or would you rather uncover the various mysteries just a scratch under the surface?

* CL 8, 40(36 droids) point buy in
* 10000 credit buy in (any credits left over after creation and buy in will be converted to the nearest HH rounded down. e.g. 99,999cr will be converted to 9HH and 0cr. If you can't afford the buy in, I will consider an RP solution when the game starts)
* Standard DP rules (but cannot be used against other PCs)
* Players will be given a starter pack (what the initial buy in of 10k gets you), including basic gear/rations/weapons, navicom data and hyperspace routes to a randomly chosen destination that houses an item of value, a ship of their choice that will be presented in game and that valuable frst HH.
* All books are allowed but try and keep it reasonable.
* Take full credits each level for your class.
* I'm looking for a post frequency of once a week, preferably more if I can keep up. Any longer than that and your character will join the ranks of the NPC character until you come back…at which point they may well be blaster fodder.
* There will be 100 players, NPCs and PCs, in the mix. So plenty of competition for creds, prestige and learning.
* Take full HP each level.
* Please include brief background, description and what brings your character to the competion sections of your char sheet.

ok, so if I have this right, everyone must have the Wealth talent? otherwise no one can afford 10k...

Is it 40 points for initial abilities, then a character gets ability increases at 4th and 8th?

I did say I would consider an RP in game solution, during a prologue say, if you were short of credits. Taking max at each level wouldn't leave you too shy of the 10k...and there are plenty of other competitors heading to the same location with presumably the correct amount of creds.

Correct

Does this make sense to you - is that how we're doing it in **HH**?

> It depends on what the GM says. I've only been in a handful of games, but usually the GM will state in the *Casting Call* something that helps. My guess has always been you just do the same thing as for level one, but all of my characters had specifically instructed guidelines so it didn't matter. If you're asking about jaybee3's game, you can ask him. He writes in his CC for **Holocron Hunters**:
> "*Take full credits each level for your class.*"
> I understand that to mean if my first level is Jedi I take 1200c. If my second level was Scoundrel I'd take 3000c, for a total so far of 4200c. So on and so forth. The example you have from Rodney is, in my opinion, no more of a guideline than anything else - it depends on what your GM allows.
> For **HH**: Since *Wealth* gives (5000c x Noble Level) x character level, it's best taken early on. If your first two levels are Noble and you have that talent, that means a whopping:
> 5000+10000+10000+10000+10000+10000+10000+10000=75000c
> …even if you don't take any more levels in Noble - and that *doesn't* include the other class's credit totals. More than enough for some awesome tech and nice ship.
> I could be wrong about any or all of that stuff though since I'm still relatively new to the SAGA system. <!– s:cool: –>![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!– s:cool: –>

Yeah <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> That's the one. So a lvl8 Jedi would have 3d4 (12) * 100 * 8 creds to start with <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Hey, what happened to this? this still on?
I figured TOR and the holidays (yes, in that order) put a general damper on activity on the site, but I´d just like to know.

### **jaybee3** (2012-01-17 10:27:09)

Just a few notes to tidy it up before I look at it in detail:

* If you don't have something for a particular section, no need to include it e.g. Force Secrets…etc
* CL should be CL 8
* For your abilities, please include the modifier too. e.g. Wis 14 (+2)…etc
* Include a level breakdown of what you took at each level in a spoiler afterwards too
* HP is full amount so you can change that to 100
* When deciding on your possessions, please post your starting cash and the value of anything you spent it on.

Sounds awesome having another character? Would you like to work on a common background or shall we keep it secret and let we see how the game flows?
I updated the character Jaybee, the equipment side remained. One get the maximum amount of starting money times per their level without any special additional feat and source, right? Should be 9600 credit then.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-01-24 07:28:21)

Correct, Starting level creds at each level. Bear in mind you'll need at least 10k to enter the competition. This can be resolved in a thread before the HH competition starts via RP though. (gambling, mugging...etc).
All you guys know about the competition is all from word of mouth and a short run of flyers circulating the shadier cantinas: it costs 10k credits to buy in, you'll be given everything you need to finish the race, you'll be rewarded with vast wealth if you're succesful and it's being run by a relatively unknown company.
