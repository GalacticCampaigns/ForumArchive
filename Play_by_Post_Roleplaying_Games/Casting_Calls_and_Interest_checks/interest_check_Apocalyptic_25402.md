# interest check Apocalyptic

Was wondering if anyone here would be interested in playing a D20 Modern game using the Apocalypse expansion? Was thinking of a post apocalyptic north america. Total economic collapse world wide after a plague outbreak. Think Mad Max meets Blade (old book series, not the Vampire half blood).
Figured the game would take place 15 years after "The Fall", some rebuilding has begun, but none of the major cities have been reclaimed. Though the game mostly would be about survival in an unforgivig land with various warlords about, there would be a few Zeds about, an after effect of the plague.
Most of the game is in my head but could easily be hashed out after another review of the D20 Modern rules. Thought it could be interesting, and with most major locations already known (fallen north america) mapping would be quick for the most part.
Is there an interest in this? Most likely would do PbP during the week with any major combat on Roll20 to speed it up and have a visual while doing so.
