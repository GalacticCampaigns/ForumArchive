# Intetest Check - SAGA - OR alt timeline

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-12 14:11:56)

Been seeing some new players and not a lot of activity from other games so wanted to post this again.
I'm thinking of running a campaign that's RP intensive with a fair amount of action. Time is based in Old Republic era but on an alternate timeline. Many events that happened cannonicly didn't therefore changing the history of the galaxy.
The Galaxy is only half discovered, the Force has not been truly discovered and therefore Sith and Jedi groups never formed. There are 3 major factions pushing for galactic control with a 4th criminal element pushing the right buttons to keep the skirmishes going. I had planned for a group to be called together and recruited to work for one of the factions doing various missions increasing their control of the galaxy, restraining the criminal faction, and writing their own history of the Star Wars Universe.
Characters will have access to force powers, although no starting Jedi/Sith levels, those will come during the story. Droid characters are welcome but I'd like to have a 1-4 droid-living ratio in the party.
Initially characters will have a lot of espionage and ground missions but eventually I expect starship combat on a large scale. Anyone intrrested in playing?
Game will be here of course and I'll be checking and posting on a daily basis. Looking for up to 8 players with a starting minimum of 4. I'd like to start around the end of July if there is enough interest.
If there is enough interest I'll post for recruitment. If you have questions feel free to ask.

So which of the books are you allowing and NOT allowing?

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-12 20:23:08)

As it stands now all of the core books and I believe all the source books. Will double check when I get home and browse through them all again. If you have a specific one in mind I'll review it

I would be interested in this game, but if you don't want to accept me I understand, seeing as I will be busy for 6 months, and my posting might be a little limited.

I'm hoping for a semi active game but lulls are expected. If there are enough interested to start a game I will.

I would be interested. As you know, I have a droid character already built but would be happy to build any other type of character, whether force-user or not.
How many force-users would you be expecting? Would they start with Force Sensitive already (as Jedi)?

Droids are good just don't want to run an all mechanical group. Yes characters can start with force sensitivity, but since Sith and Jedi groups never formed those classes are restricted to later in the game. They will have access to all powers/abilities once deeper into campaign and can start with a few basic powers.
I wouldn't mind a 50-50 group of forcers to non-forcers.
Imagine discovering you have an ability and learning to control it and figuring out what you can and can't do with it and how it affects you (dark side) when you do certain things. As we get deeper in the campaign I hope to let the players develop portions of the history of this time line, although, yes I have a few end game variants in mind. If they choose to create the "Guilds" of Jedi or Sith or some mixture of the two I won't stop them and may even create a side thread to allow them to pursue that as well as the game.
I know we may loose some characters over time due to RL issues and have plans in mind for such events so the group can continue on without loosing a character completely.

Hello I'm new and would be quite interested in this idea, if there's an empty slot I'll take it if you'll have me <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Tiger, this was just an interest check, not a casting call. Just seeing if there is enough interest to run this game. Keep an eye out for a casting call.

### **TigerEagle** (2013-06-16 14:02:33)

Ok I will

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-16 22:20:44)

Well looks like we have the minimum I was looking for. Keep a look out for a **Casting Call** to be posted this week.
