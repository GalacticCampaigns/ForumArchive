Song of Ice and Fire Roleplay: Wedding Knight
"The saga of Westeros told in George R.R. Martinâ€™s A Song of Ice and Fire novel series is a family saga, the tale of noble houses playing the most dangerous game, the game of thrones, for the greatest of prizes. So it is a story about alliances and betrayals, love and hate, and the rise and fall of great dynasties. A central element is marriage, as both a tool of the great players of the game, and a romantic ideal for those young enough to still hold it in their hearts." ---From the Introduction.
This game will use the Song of Ice and Fire Roleplay (SIFRP) ruleset. For interested parties, there is a Quick Start rules .pdf available on Green Ronin's site for free download. The players will take control of the Pre-Generated Characters present in that document, so everyone can get a grasp of the mechanics, and also express interest to me which character they'd like to run. The Pre-Gens will have to have a slight facelift as far as backstory, as they are intended for a different adventure, but will work just as well. The Premise of the Story is as follows:
As is often the case in the Seven Kingdoms, two minor noble houses, at odds with each other for years, are about to be united through an alliance of marriage. Ser Kevan Manning, a young knight and scion of a house sworn to King Robert Baratheon, is to wed Sylvie Harte, the daughter of a rival house. Due to their past bitterness, the wedding is to be held on neutral ground. The players, both Noble and Smallfolk, are members of House Blackwood. House Blackwood has long had good relations with both Houses seperately. The festivities leading up to and following the ceremony are to take place on their estate. What will happen when two old enemies draw so closely together? Can the members of House Blackwood get through this grand occasion with their honor and reputation intact?
Guidelines:
-Players must select one of the pregens from the quickstart rules document located here: <!-- m -->[http://greenronin.com/sifrp/](http://greenronin.com/sifrp/ "http://greenronin.com/sifrp/")<!-- m -->
-I'd like to see posting once per day/once every other day, just to keep the game moving. A failure to post for a week will get your character autopiloted, and put you in the back of the line to get back in, barring real-world issues, of course.
-The posts should be grammatically sound. Spell Check is your friend.
-I don't want to see one- or two-line posts. Take your time, write something thought out and entertaining to read. Have fun with the characters.
-The system uses a d6 roll and keep method. All dice will be rolled in the built in forum dice roller.
-Its okay if a player doesn't know all the rules to this system. Its relatively new, after all! I've been pouring over the rulebook, and I expect to be very active guiding and teaching the play of the game. That said, my PM box is always open, or you could ask OOC questions (apropriately marked) at the end of your posts.
Overall, I want to try out something new, and have some fun in a rich fantasy setting! Let's give it a shot!

Well SB, sounds good to me. My top choice for character would be Maester Rudolphus.

Okay! One down and five left.
You are Rudolphus, Maester of House Blackwood. You are the mentor of young Lord Rhys, keeper of the House's ravens, physician, and scholar. It is a mark of honor when a House retains the services of a Maester, and you have served the Blackwoods with distinction and pride. You have been very well treated, and are fiercely loyal to your young Lord and his family.
Hosting the wedding between Martell and Harte was your idea, though you stand back and take no public credit. You feel that it makes good political sense to have a neutral location for this wedding, but you have other ulterior motives. Lord Rhys will benefit greatly from hosting this event. He must stand on his own as a leader before the other nobles in order to be taken seriously in the Game of Thrones...
OOC: Excellent Choice!

This looks like it could be a lot of fun. I am interested in playing Ser Merik.

Caboose:
You are Ser Merik Blackwood.You are the noble Uncle to the young Lord Rhys, and you served your brother, his father before him. When you were a younger man, you lived in the thrill of the tourney, the battle-charge across the open field. Now things have changed. With your brother's tragic death, you are more concerned with protecting Lord Rhys, his House and lands from opportunistic neighbors. The day you marched into the audience hall of House Blackwood and bent the knee to your young nephew is still fresh in your memory. The doddering Maester can lecture all that he wants about history and diplomacy, you know better. Steel and courage on an open battlefield have won more decisive victories in the Game of Thrones than words ever could.
Your loyalty to your Lord is both just and appropriate, but there are more things that tie you to your brother's House than just a bloodline. There are things like his late wife, the Septa Alanna. When the both of you were younger men, you hid your love for her deep in your heart out of respect for your brother. You have truly sinned in the eyes of the Seven, for when you were annointed and swore fealty to your Lord brother, in your heart you pledged to his wife. Now with the death of her husband, the Septa Alanna has given up her royal title to become a Septa in the Church of the Seven. She now lives and serves as a woman of the cloth at Blackwood Chapel, and yet, you love her even the more. Though propriety has stayed your hand, you would fight and die for the Lady you love in silence.
You have mixed emotions about the Wedding. It would be the perfect time to attack your Lord Rhys in a bid to take what his father built. The House and grounds will be filled with the entourages of many Nobles, including their Knights and honor guards, and the Warrior only knows what can happen...
OOC: Two down, and four still available for play!

Oh man, I so shotty Septa Alanna.

Blackhat:
You are Septa Alanna. Once a Noble Lady, with the death of your husband, the House falls to your young son, Rhys. No longer a wife and with a son grown, you are not content to mill idly about the House, or while away the hours bent over some needlework. You have given up your titles and lands, and taken up the Cloth. You are a Septa, in service to the Seven. When both your son Rhys and Maester Rudolphus insisted, the Church very wisely allowed you to serve at Blackwood Chapel. The many Smallfolk in the Blackwood lands travel to the Keep every Highday to hear your comforting sermons, participate in your rituals, and occasionally unburden their souls to you. Your position as a religious leader among your son's people have given you a keen perspective on their lives. Your Lord son will need your guidance. The opinion of the Smallfolk has more than a little influence of the Game of Thrones...
As a Septa, you venerate all of the Seven, but you hold a special place in your heart for the Crone, and you carry a small stone in your pocket fashioned with the image of her face. She carries a lamp to light the darkness. She is the goddess of Wisdom, and the face of Fate. With the future of your son's House so uncertain, you've burned more than a few candles in prayer to her.
With the upcoming Wedding, you'll be assisting House Harte's Septon in the ceremony. All your thoughts and energies go toward this event. You only hope that it goes smoothly. When things go wrong around a religious event, all that the Smallfolk see are signs and portents. Your Lord son's subjects must be content, and confident in their leader in the days to come...
OOC: This is the one I expected to get picked last!

This is going great! Three characters have been chosen so far: Septa Alanna, Maester Rudolphus, and Ser Merik.
Three characters remain:
Ser Merik's Squire, the rascal Jonah
House Blackwood's most loyal retainer, Nicholas Rivers
The young Lord of House Blackwood, Rhys
Get 'em while they're hot!
I'd like to have a full complement of players, however, I don't want this game to die before it gets off of the ground, so: Sunday we begin play, full cast or no. Of course, after Sunday, any characters not spoken for are welcome to be taken up by latecomers!

Been looking at the game and it has drawn some of my interest. However, looks like they're aren't any female characters left and I didn't particularly want to play Septa Alanna. <!-- s:/ -->![:/](https://i.ibb.co/1fht9Fjq/icon-mad.gif)<!-- s:/ -->

Alicia: If you are interested in playing in the game: download the quick start rules at greenronin.com, and read the blurb for Squire Jonah. I think you'd like that character. Just a thought. *wink*

### **simplyscribed** (2010-12-01 10:54:55)

Nicholas Rivers please, Agent Superball. Though if no one speaks up for Lord Rhys by Sunday I will claim him instead if it will make your life any easier.
I had thought to play Squire Jonah, but after reading "his" profile I think I'll leave it for Alicia...

simplyscribed:
You are Nicholas Rivers. You are an illegitimate child, ever marked by your name. You are also the son of the recently deceased Lord, and Rhys' half brother though none know this but you. Rhys' noble father saw to the well being of you and your mother, and made you apprentice to the Master of Horses. You earned the reputation of being a stalwart man, and a capable rider, and were allowed to accompany the nobles on the hunt. When you saved a life from the charge of a wounded boar, that's when you became a trusted retainer. You were the Horsemaster's apprentice no more. You are Smallfolk, and low-born. You aren't a member of the Household guards, or the army. You aren't oathsworn, and yet you are allowed to bear arms around the Keep. You have the option of being present during audiences and councils.
Lord Rhys trusts you with his life, and listens to your council. He does because you've proven your worth, instead of being born to it, and because you have nothing to gain by misleading him, being Smallfolk, and apolitical. You think of yourself, not as just a retainer, but a bodyguard. The Wedding is important to you, because it is a time when your half-brother is the most vulnerable. Not only are you concerned for his personal health and safety, but also for the things that you cannot protect him from: scheming Nobles, whispering honey into his ear. Promising him gold, steel, even brides, and never once speaking the truth of their hearts. Your strong hands can choke the life from any man, but in the Game of Thrones, your Lord can be strangled slowly with promises and talk, and not even know it...

Okay all, I hope that you are really excited! I know that I am! Game starts in four days. I just put in the request for a Subforum. Also a quick note about available characters: Squire Jonah is spoken for, which leaves one character left:
Lord Rhys Blackwood!
The supporting characters have been scooped up, each a Player of the Game in their own small ways, but who will play the central figure in this drama? Who will possess the courage and the fortitude to take part (eventually) in the Game of Thrones???

### **Anonymous** (2010-12-04 01:41:57)

Hello. I think I may make a bid for Lord Rhys Blackwood.

### **Anonymous** (2010-12-04 01:56:36)

Hi!
I would really enjoy being Squire Jonah. If no one else claims ...him.

Jesshire:
You are Squire Jonah, apprenticed in the courtly arts of wa to Ser Merik Blackwood. You have a big secret. Though you, and everyone around you calls you Jonah, you were born with the name Jhenna. You are a girl. You are a daughter in another minor noble House in the Riverlands. Growing up, you preferred running through the woods with the boys and playing Knights and Squires. Constantly chased by Septas, Lady's maid's, and even rarely by your own noble parents, you spent most of your youth escaping the Needle and Gown. Your dream is to bear arms in battle as a Knight. Arranged to marry a many thirty years your senior by your parents, you fled the household. Cutting your hair, and stealing a few coins and Boy's clothing, you ran off into the night, walking for days.
When you woke up in the Stables of House Blackwood, Nicholas Rivers, Horsemaster's Apprentice, was standing over you. He arranged for "Jonah" to have food and a warm bed for working with his Lord's horses. Eventually the Seven smiled on you. Your skill with the steeds was noticed one day while riding along with Nicholas on the Hunt. Ser Merik's squire had fallen in battle years ago. The old Knight had loved him like a son, and refused to replace him, until Lord Rhys asked him to take another, and indicated you (on the advice of Nicholas). Lord Rhys gave you your chance to become a Knight, and he unknowingly shelters you from your searching parents. You owe him everything. Ser Merik is teaching you the ways of Knighthood and combat. You respect your master in all things. Nicholas Rivers is the only one who knows your true identity, he is a stalwart companion, you won't let him down.
The Wedding is an scary time for you, bringing up horrible visions of what will happen to you if you are discovered. Not only are you expected to attend Ser Merik, but you are a trusted Lieutenant of Nicholas. He can't speak up around the Nobles, and he can't be everywhere at once, but House Blackwood will be teeming with small boys. You can get to places the big man cannot go, and you are unobtrusive and mostly underfoot in all but the tensest private conversations. You are the Eyes and Ears of the Retainer, his Hand if you will, and you will serve your Lord in the Game of Thrones best with this duty...

strangeramongus:
You are Lord Rhys Blackwood. You are Master of your House at fourteen. You have held this title for one week. Seven days have passed since your Noble father struck a low branch with his head while riding the Hunt. You have been trained for this day since you could speak, you just thought it would happen much later. These last days have not been difficult, because you've asked yourself the same question a hundred times: "What would my Father do?" You have gathered about you a Lord's Small Council. This is a group that has no public meetings. They speak to you candidly, and tell you the things that you need to hear: Your Uncle, Ser Merik. He has been your Father's right hand in War. He was his, and now your loyal bannerman. Your teacher and Mentor Maester Rudolphus. You trust the old man as your father did. You crave his wise political council. Your mother Septa Alanna, a Lady no more. She has your best interest in heart as your mother. As a Septa, she understands the will of the Smallfolk, and has no small ability to sway it. Ser Merik's Squire, Jonah. At first he came to the meetings to learn at his master's side. It came to your attention that the rascal can be anywhere and hear anything. Finally, your retainer, Nicholas Rivers. The big man would terrify you if he wasn't the protector of your person. A wild bull of a man, an unstoppable force. You'll have need of him in the days to come.
You haven't yet made your journey to King's landing to legitimize your right to rule before the King, Robert Baratheon. Until you do, your House stands on a knife's edge. With no acknowledged Lord, the House is anyone's prize for the taking. The Wedding will only buy you some time. Its an excuse to wait awhile, being obliged to others as Host. But it is Maester Rudolphus' hope that you will win more than one friend among those attending. If that happens, perhaps House Blackwood will not fall to another's schemes. Mayhaps even, it will strengthen and grow to become a Great House. From this day forward, whether you wish it or no, you are a Player in the Game of Thrones...

That's all the slots! Keep reading this thread if you are interested in this game. As players opt out or lose interest, their characters may come available for play. Any changes in the status of a character will be noted here.
