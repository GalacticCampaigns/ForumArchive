# [SAGA OR] Growing Shadows (accepting concepts)

### **Alicia** (2010-05-04 18:20:56)

It's a dark time for the Republic. The Jedi Civil war has left the Republic in a state of disarray. The Jedi Order depleted and believed unreliable by the people has been disbanded leaving much of the galaxy open for the taking.
With the greatest of the Republic's heroes gone, the newly redeemed Revan having left for the Unknown Regions in the Ebon Hawk, the Republic seeks desperately for a hero or heroes to take his place.
**Campaign Summary information**
Set about one year (c. 3,955 BBY) after the first [Knights of the Old Republic video game](http://www.gaiaonline.com/gaia/redirect.php?r=http%3A%2F%2Fstarwars.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FStar_Wars%3A_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic "http://www.gaiaonline.com/gaia/redirect.php?r=http%3A%2F%2Fstarwars.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FStar_Wars%3A_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic").
* Revan (male, light side) has left for the Unknown Regions in the Ebon Hawk
* The Jedi Order has disbanded due to their weakened state wrought by the [Mandalorian War](http://www.gaiaonline.com/gaia/redirect.php?r=http%3A%2F%2Fstarwars.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FMandalorian_War "http://www.gaiaonline.com/gaia/redirect.php?r=http%3A%2F%2Fstarwars.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FMandalorian_War") and the [Jedi Civil war](http://www.gaiaonline.com/gaia/redirect.php?r=http%3A%2F%2Fstarwars.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FJedi_Civil_War "http://www.gaiaonline.com/gaia/redirect.php?r=http%3A%2F%2Fstarwars.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FJedi_Civil_War"). Slowly the Sith are hunting them to extinction.
The current story, if you haven’t been following along, currently consists of two groups, which would be essential in impacting the plotline. It would be best to decide whether you want to participate in one faction or the other.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**The Brotherhood**</span>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Best described as a splinter sect of Jedi, it was founded by Jut-hakk as an alternative to the Jedi Order at the end of the Great Sith War. Formed away from the watching eye of the Republic and Jedi Order, Jut-hakk recruited stray Jedi who had lost faith in the Order due to contrary beliefs or because of the wars (Great Sith War, Mandalorian War and Jedi Civil War) as well as other Force Users members happened to come across. Acting as a community of various beliefs, the Brotherhood has no set tenets its members are required to follow aside from one: Preservation of Knowledge. This is accomplished through the teaching of apprentices, sharing of knowledge through archival and scientific pursuits or the gathering of texts and artifacts.
Over the past century, the Brotherhoods numbers have grown to not only include a wide arrange of Force Users but also soldiers and other support personnel who assist in maintaining and protecting the numerous hidden holdings throughout the Outer Rim. Members of the Brotherhood would be welcome to bring their family and many may have been born into the sect.
Most recently Jut-hakk has expended resources in tracking down and preserving artifacts and any knowledge garnered by the Jedi Order. The most recent news involves an incident at Acheron research station where due to a mechanical error in the power generator the station was destroyed. While most of the personnel escape, Master Jut-hakk, his apprentice Davian, lieutenant Master Lanius, his apprentice Fiolla Narcassan, the Mandalorian Ka’ra Bralor and a shuttle with all hands from Lanius’s governance of Telia IV is still unaccounted for.
**Getting Involved** Members of this sect come from all walks of life, united in their one common purpose: the preservation of knowledge. Force Users in particular find solace in this group whether they are joining as an alternative to the Jedi Order or have left the Order and seek further knowledge and companionship. Support personnel in the form of soldiers and mechanics could easily find work along with their families.
With recent events, a team could be dispatched to investigate the disappearances of Jut-hakk and the others as well as the destruction of the station.
Additionally, while most aren’t aware of Jut-hakk’s current activities, the heroes could be working to further his goals. (see 2nd paragraph of Splinter Group)

</details>

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Splinter Group**</span>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Led by Lanius and Ka’ra Bralor and formed to subvert Jut-hakk’s malevolent plans, members brought in were originally from outside of the Brotherhood hired for their discretion and willingness. As Lanius attempts to bring the truth of Jut-hakk’s agenda to light, starting with those living at Telia V, more have come to his aid. The base of Telia V is nearly fully under his control.
The truth as Lanius tells it is he was commissioned by Jut-hakk to learn the location of an artifact used by Exar Kun during the Great Sith War. Able to absorb the life energy out of anything it came in contact with, the artifact known as the Force Harvester could be used as a power source for a powerful weapon. While he doesn’t know Jut-hakk’s full intentions, Jut-hakk has made comments leading him to believe the aging Zabrak wants to unleash it upon the Galaxy.
Having recovered the Force Harvester with the help of a special team from Jut-hakk’s grasp on Acheron, he is now working to either destroy it or find a safe location to hide while at the same time ensuring Jut-hakk’s allies are unable to further their master’s goals.
**Getting Involved** Members of the team need to have some motivation in assisting Lanius in ensuring that the recovered Force Harvester remains safe. They can be allies from the Republic Hammerhead cruiser *Titan’s Valiant* on special (and secret) assignment by Captain Niandra Prius, or they can be from the Brotherhood having heard Lanius’s tale and decided to join. Additionally, they could have come from outside, hired by Ka’ra to provide a special service the team may be lacking.

I might be interested and will most likely sit down tomorrow and think about a character.
I do have a question though, in regards of the 'theme' of it all. Are the players supposed to be part of and strong supporters of the Republic? Are they strugglers who are not yet dead after the Jedi Order disbanded? Are they Fringers, who just happen to be good aligned, but feel no particular loyalty to any group?

## Re: Growing Shadows

### **Alicia** (2010-05-04 18:40:26)

It could be any of the above, but those with some ties to the Republic (wanting to help in some fashion after the civil war) would ultimately be beneficial and would fit in the best.

As an addendum, you get the same amount as your starting credits to use specifically for contacts (max starting of first level + (level -1) x 2,000, double total amount for wealth). Any remainder can go into property which could not be quickly liquidated, such as a home, stocks, bonds, etc.
Also forgot to mention to use max HP.
These will be edited into the first post.

The Old Republic is my favorite era, and this sounds like my type of game. I´ll try to get something together soon.
I have only one question, do you have any preference on us using Destinies or Backgrounds? I´m thinking of going a little more low key and stay without the flashy superpowers of destiny, and use the more subtle advantages of a background.

## Re: Growing Shadows

### **Alicia** (2010-05-04 20:18:16)

I would prefer if Destinies was used. I don't particularly like how the did they background bonuses. I have something else in mind for when I start seeing characters.

**Background:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Alarick always had plenty of money as a kid and had the biggest and greatest toys any kid could want but he always liked trying to make his own things. This desire grew as he got older, however his mother never like him trying to build things. At the age of thirteen his mother left him and his father due to the fact that his father spent all his time trying to make his company better. This freed up the only barrier that was keeping him out of the factory. Alarick was the youngest employ at the age of fourteen after proving that he could build a better weapon than on of the top R&D techs, however he was not allowed to join the R&D due to the fact that the military would not allow a child to work on their projects.
As Alarick grew older he took more and more interest in weapons, armor, and prosthesis manufacturing. To satisfy that thirst of knowledge he joined the R&D section of his fathers factory, now renown for its innovative weapons, armor, and prosthesis ideas. Alarick quickly learned how to design weapons that worked better without cutting back on the quality of the weapon. After Alarick learned how deal with other companies and was moved out of R&D and into a position to help deal with other companies but he still spent all his free time in the R&D labs. By the age of 26 Alarick realized that there were many things he needed to learn in order to make even better equipment, that on top of the fact that he wanted to make a name for himself spurned his motivation to make his own company, explore the galaxy, and learn all that he could. He intends to find out what it is people, and possibly the military, need so he can make a better company than his fathers.

</details>

**Description:** Alarick is about two meters tall and weighs about 82 kg. He has short brown hair and his white suite allows him to stand out in a room. Along with his rings and custom weapons his wealth is easily shown. Most people don't know his eye color due to the fact that he's always wearing his sunglasses.

Have you played the KoTOR games?
Its about 5 years after Revan and the Republic defeated and killed their Mandalore ending the war. After the war, the Mandos are scattered, taking to the space lanes and become mercenaries. Some band together to form groups as is seen in the game on Dantooine.
Here's a blurp from the Wookie concerning them:
[Mandalorians](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mandalorian "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mandalorian")<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The Neo-Crusaders were an assortion of many diffent races led by Mandalore the Ultimate and started the Mandalorian Wars. During this time, the Mandalorians would cause chaos upon the Republic, committing atrocities such as wiping out most of the Cathar race, and reducing the surface of the planet Serroco to glass with nuclear bombs. The Mandalorians' victory seemed assured, until the Jedi Knights Revan and Malak led a large portion of the Jedi Order to war, no longer able to sit back and watch the Republic crumble under the Mandalorians vicious attacks. The Mandalorians were then slowly but surely pushed back to the Outer Rim, where Revan lured them to Malachor V. Revan personally killed Mandalore the Ultimate in close combat, and utterly destroyed the Mandalorian Fleet, along with a large part of the Republic's as well.
After their defeat in the Mandalorian Wars at the hands of the Jedi Revan and Malak, the Mandalorians went into a long decline. Revan destroyed their stockpiles of weaponry and battle droids, and exiled the clans into the Outer Rim. One group settled on Tatooine, but apparently lost contact with other Mandalorians over time.
Some Mandalorians were unable to accept the terms of their defeat, and turned to piracy, brigandage, and mercenary work – e.g. Sherruk's group, who became bandits and troubled the settlers of Dantooine in 3,956 BBY. Canderous Ordo, who fought side by side with a redeemed Revan against Darth Malak during the Jedi Civil War, later claimed the rank of Mandalore and led a small remnant of his followers on the moon of Dxun. It was again Ordo, who traveled the galaxy with the Jedi Exile, and gathered the scattered Mandalorians who became mercenaries. Ordo was also a key in defeating the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus on the battleship Ravager.

</details>

I suggest reading all of it up to the section about the Treaty of Coruscant in regards to history then the rest of the article to learn about their culture. My GMPC is a mando so things may not turn out so well for your character if you acted "improperly". Much of how I portray them comes from Karen Traviss, so take that how you will as well.

Yeah, I know that some GMs do not like having droids in their groups, which is why I asked, before I sat down and wasted a day on creating a character that is instantly denied due to it being Droidish. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I wouldn't start the stats until you give me a background and personality summary for it. That;s what I would mainly use to discern whether I may allow it or not. Feel free to PM it to me for review.
Also, unless you want everyone to know your favors I would PM those to me separately. Remember to be as descriptive as possible concerning them.

## Re: Growing Shadows

### **Sketchpad** (2010-05-06 01:15:44)

Hiya Alicia,
Okay ... I reworked Grey a bit and also had another crazy idea ...
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Grey**</span>
***Rogue Jedi Knight***
**Homeworld:** Unknown
**Background:** The man that would become Grey has been forgotten. Rumors have been told that he once served as a padawan to a powerful Jedi, while others say that he was on Taris when it was destroyed. From what most have pieced together, he was born on somewhere in Wildspace and has taken on a self-imposed role of protector, often sporting a pair white-blue guard shotos at his side. Some believe that he's seen something that has changed him; possibly the death of a loved one, or the loss of a dear friend. His strange, red markings appear to serve as a rank of something that he's done, though he refuses to talk about it to anyone. Those that he's helped, he says little to, vanishing as quickly as he appears; while those that he battles, he grants a solemn word to as he cuts them down with righteous fury.
**Personality:** Grey is a quiet person. He doesn't strive for much companionship, but, subconsciously, needs something more. In many ways, he sees himself as an instrument of justice, striking a swift blow at the evils of the galaxy. But eventually he'll know that this isn't something he can do alone and realize there are reasons why his master let him leave so easily (and with his lightsaber). Deep down, he seeks a purpose and redemption, as he blames himself for the death of Rhinda, and feels that he's let those closest to him down.
As Grey, he's able to put some of those feelings behind him, striving to do as much good as possible. In many ways, he seeks out trouble, hitting hot spots and criminal hives specifically for the purpose of hunting down evil at its core. If there's any vulnerability that shakes his foundations, it's the Sith. In his mind, they are the personification of evil and need to be surgically removed from the galaxy. Luckily, he's the doctor and his lightsaber is his scalpel of choice.
**Appearance:** Grey is around average height, with a slim, wiry build. He has shaggy, almost anime-like, gray hair with gold eyes, which gleam in the night. Encompassing the right side of his body is a Ozirian shimmer mark that appears like a glowing tattoo when he's feeling strong emotions or using his Force powers. He typically wears a hooded, black jacket, gray shirt and black pants with a pair of sporty, black shoes.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Dremmin Kol**</span>
***Adventurous Scholar***
**Homeworld:** Corellia
**Background:** Spending summers with his Uncle Gym was one of the most exhilarating things about Dremmin's childhood. While most of his classmates were out at camp, or learning a trade, he was off exploring worlds with his uncle and his crew aboard the Lookabout, a medium freighter and hyperspace trailblazer. As he grew older, his father had hoped the youth would follow in his footsteps, but it was already too late; Dremmin had already decided what he wanted to do with his life. During his academy years, he studied hyperspace routes and the various lore of mythical civilizations, taking on additional classes in survival and mechanics when he could. By the time he'd graduated, Dremmin was within the top ten percent of his class and ready to head into the dangerous coils of the Unknown Regions.
But not everything was as smooth as he expected. His parents, who helped him with his schooling, wanted him to stay home and work as a teacher. His uncle, who he'd hoped to sign on with, hadn't been heard from in years after taking a supply run into the Outer Rim. So, looking for an escape, he jumped the first ship leaving the Core Worlds, and managed to eventually pick up work with the Republic Astrogation Survey Team for a few years. Working as an independent guide these days, Dremmin keeps the glowstick lit for his uncle and hopes to one day delve into the mystery of his disappearance.
**Personality:** Dremmin is an adventurer first and foremost. While a bit cocky and impulsive, he's also very knowledgeable and capable in most situations, including combat. In the field, he expects anyone under his guidance to listen to him and do as they're told. In this past, this hasn't mixed well with clients, but most come to realize their error when falling into a rancor graveyard or stumbling across a narglatch lair. Dremmin isn't outwardly organized, often leaving piles of "sorted" mess behind him as he works on a route or reading about a legend. But he also isn't a slob either, often noting that the messes he leaves are there "for a reason". And, while he doesn't have the greatest relationship with most of his relatives, he has a driving need to find his uncle and help him in any way that he can.
**Appearance:** Dremmin is average height with a slightly athletic build for a human male in his mid-20s. He has scruffy, auburn hair that's a bit shaggy and stretches down into long, unkempt sideburns, and brown eyes. His typical style of dress is that of a field scout, often sporting a dark jacket, nondescript shirts, multi-pocketed slacks and thick boots, but he's also been known to "clean up good" when he needs to.

But, after some time, Gridd wanted a bit more for himself, so he gave up the scouting life and became a smuggler. During the summers that Dremmin spent with his uncle, he'd gotten to know Gridd and could count on him in a tight spot.
*Gilda Gold, Pop Holostar [CL 1]:* During one of Dremmin's early adventures, he'd met Gilda when he was sent into Felucia after her ship had made an emergency landing.

While their "relationship" has been strained, she would gladly help him again if it meant she could see him.

Hiya Alicia,
I can work with either and will gladly defer to your judgment on this. If you'd prefer that I play Grey over Dax, I have no issues with that <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> I always like to give folks options ...

Could also be amusing, but I think I'm leaning more toward approving Grey.

Do you know how much longer you'll be recruiting for? I'm interested in this game, but unfortunately I'm about to move to another apartment, so for now most of my time is packing and cleaning, packing and cleaning. I'll prolly not be able to do anything until sometime after the 17th of this month (we move in the time from the 13th to the 16th).

I was hoping to start the game the 17 or 18. Think you could have your character ready before Sunday? That was when I was planning on making my decision. I would only hold off if I felt I didn't have enough submissions but several people have shown interest outside of the thread so this may not be the case.

That's fine. I'll see if it's possible for me to find the time. I have no idea if it'll take all the days to move or if we might be finished earlier.

I haven't really started yet, but tomorrow I'll be spending most of the morning in the new place while waiting for some people to set up our internet, TV and other stuff like that. I should be able to fill out most stuff there, so after that I'd not need long to write it from paper to digital media.

I´m almost done, I just have a few finishing questions that are partially for future planning.

* Is it ok with you to use Lightsaber Form Powers(JATM) that grants you an attack in combination with abilities that modifies attacks? For example, could I use Melee Defense on the attack granted by Fluid Riposte?
* About the Favors we can buy, can we buy more of them later on if we get the money?

That´s about it, I´ll probably PM you shortly with info on favors and some other things.

Form Powers are allowed. As for using Melee Defense with Fluid Riposte, no. Reason being that Melee Defense is used in conjunction with a **standard** attack. Fluid Riposte is a **reaction** providing a single attack with success.

I will allow you to "buy" additional favors later, but it will have to be from someone you already had a favor with though I will allow it to be a different type if it's within the NPC's means. (Say a military favor from a political favor who may have some pull.)

Thanks what was your first level? HP and feats say Jedi, skills say Scoundrel.
Also you deduct starting equipment from the credits of 5200 if Jedi. This includes the surgery fee and cost of the cybernetic.

**Background** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Yuri was born on Taris, and luckily enough his parents both belonged in the upper class and were the owners of a successful business. And of course they wanted their son to follow in their footsteps. Unfortunately for them, the boy wanted differently. He was more interested in running away from his parents and down to the lower levels of Taris, where the less fortunate citizens lived. The more time he spent there, the more he came to despise the upper class and “nobles”, even though he realized that he in fact belonged in that category himself.
His parents did not like this at all, and he was thoroughly scolded and punished for it. This didn´t discourage him though, it only made him develop better methods for getting away from all the private tutors and etiquette teachers his parents stuck him with. He became quite skilled at lying and sneaking around, and was happy when he could spend more time with the friends he made in the lower levels. He suspected that it would come to an end soon though, since his parents were likely to keep him busier and busier the older he got. Luckily, fate would intervene and save him.
Much as he had suspected, his parents were intensifying his studies, but where he expected some stuffy professor from a local university, he instead was introduced to a Jedi Knight, there to teach him philosophy, ethics, and other things you might expect a Jedi to be versed in. What was even more interesting was that the Jedi almost immediately stated the he could sense the Force in Yuri, and that he would like to take the boy to the Jedi Temple for training. While his parents were not exactly thrilled, for once in their life, they let Yuri make his own choice. For him the choice was easy. While he still loved his parents as a child do, his despise for everything they represented had only grown since his first venture down into the lower levels. Among the friends he had made in those levels, many had told him stories of the legendary knights of the Jedi Order, and many of the younger ones hoped that someday a Jedi would come and save them from their misery. Feeling a hope that he someday could become that Jedi, Yuri didn´t hesitate for a second in accepting the offer.
When Yuri was brought to the Jedi Temple, many people knew that the Galaxy stood at the brink of a major conflict. Not particularly because of Yuri, but because the Mandalorians had begun their incursion into the Outer Rim not long ago. At such a low age though, the invasion had little impact on Yuri at all. He passed through his basic Jedi Training with ease, and he showed potential for becoming a great Jedi Knight one day. Eventually, he was chosen as the apprentice of Jonah Tensis, an elder Jedi Master and an excellent swordsman. Under his tutelage, Yuri´s skill with the lightsaber grew, but he also expanded much of his other skills in the Force, becoming highly attuned to the flow of the living Force and changes in his surroundings.
As Yuri grew in age, so did his awareness of greater galactic events, and with the warrior spirit inside him he grew more and more frustrated with the decision of the Jedi Council to remain passive in the face of the Mandalorian assault on the Republic. When he heard rumors that the Jedi Revan and his Jedi Crusaders had taken the battle to the enemy, and that their intervention was slowing the enemy advance, he felt urges to join them, and stand at the front with them. He did, however, choose to remain at his masters side, and even if he didn´t really trust the wisdom of the Concil´s decision, he trusted his masters. And as it turned out, they probably did the right choice, as few of the Jedi that followed Revan ever returned to the Order.
When the war finally ended with the battle over Malachor V, Yuri was 19 years old, and had become a skilled Jedi. But nothing had prepared him for what would come. A year later, Revan returned to the Galaxy, now bearing the title of Sith Lord, and leading a great Sith fleet against the Republic. Yuri knew that this time he would have been unable to stand on the side, even if the Council had urged him to. Together with his master, Yuri was tasked with finding a way to halt the Sith advance, but all they found were the blades of Sith assassins and fallen Jedi alike. Eventually, as the war turned with the fall of Darth Revan, and the return of the legenday Jedi to the Light, Jonah was tasked with accompanying the task Force that aided Revan and his companions during their assault on the Star Forge. That would be the last time Yuri saw his master alive.
After the war ended with the fall of Darth Malak, and the destruction of the Star Forge, Yuri found himself in a difficult position. Barely a hundred Jedi remained, and they were not standing in good graces, and his master had been slain. Sith assassins were still active, hunting Jedi at every corner, and now even the Prodigal Knight had left the Galaxy behind. Reaching into the Force for answers, he was shocked as a vision and a voice manifested in his mind, the lingering spirit of his old master. Jonah told Yuri to not lose faith. The Jedi may have been crippled and nearly destroyed, but as long as a few individuals carried the teachings of the Jedi in their minds, the Order would survive, and eventually rebuild again. But for now, the Galaxy was not a place for them. He urged his apprentice to hide, to cast aside his identity as a Jedi until the time was right, and to search for answers.
It has been about a year now since the war ended. Yuri has not once called himself a Jedi since. He has been travelling the Galaxy as a Bounty Hunter, often offering up his skills for free in the name of justice. With the Jedi gone, his only remaining goal is to continue to honor his skills and uphold the Jedi ideals, that he might be ready again when the time comes for the Jedi´s resurrection. In the meanwhile, he tries to gather what clues he can concerning the remaining Sith, and how to defeat them.

</details>

**Personality** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Yuri has always been social and outgoing, easily making friends and finding an upside in everything. While the Jedi Civil War did put a more serious tone to his personality, the old core still remains, and in an effort to hide his identity as a former Jedi, he has let it forward again. He is guided in life by both the Jedi Code and his own moral values, which at points may clash. He is a great admirer of Revan and aspires to become like him. He believes that it is impossible to ever grasp the full spectrum of the Force by refusing to look at both sides. By practicing the seventh lightsaber form, he carefully moves closer to the border between the Light and Dark, by letting more dangerous emotions surface. The spirit of his master lingers with him, offering advice and warnings to his student.

Jesh Sketch... You had to go and make another awesome character. Both of them would work well within the scope of the campaign so guess what... YOU PICK!
Also remember that the credits you get are to be spent on buying your starting equipment (we had already discussed that a Jedi's basic lightsaber was free, upgrades were extra), you don't get to start with that amount.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Kin Var</span>
Kin Var grew up in the shadow of a military family with the previous generations being proud fighters for the republic, his family name even belonged to a few jedi in the past. He himself became nothing more than a soldier however, serving in the republic. His early name passed without incident, only after he joined the military did things take a turn for the worst. Kin served as a marine in the Republic Navy, defending against boarding parties and taking part in them too. He quickly grew attached to the flechette launcher which exelled in such close quarters.
The outbreak of the mandalorian war ensured Kin saw his fair share of the action. He also fell in love with a Togrutan named Kara, she was a pilot and he would always be there to meet her after a mission if possible. The battle of Iridonia didn't go well for the ship they were stationed on, the fighting crippled it badly and whole sections of the craft fell towards the planet below, one had Kin within it. He never found out the true fate of Kara but he knew inside she must have died, no other survivors from the ship or her squadron were ever found. The 'landing' on the planet had nearly broken his mind as well as his body. His right arm was beyond all medical science and replaced with a military standard cybernetic limb. The crash also left his eyes horribly damaged and they were replaced, though they were much harder to spot as being synthetic.
Kin continued to fight for the Republic once he healed, it didn't feel like it used to however. He'd lost everything dear to him and began to take almost suicidal risks. Charging towards enemy firebases or standing in front of incoming fire to shield an ally. Comrades remark how it seems he wants death to take him and dares it to at every oppertunity.
Appearance:
Kin is clearly a veteran of combat, his face his scarred and his cybernetic limb is visibly mechanical. His eyes look organic however, and it'd probably take a doctor to discover their synthetic manufacture. His head tendrils are kept bare and Kin is about average height for his race, being 1.8 metres tall. He's now in his late twenties with little to show apart from his scars and broken body. He typically wears simple clothes, preferring to keep his arms bare and clothes loose. His cybernetic arm has a dull metallic finish which has been coloured with camoflauge paints in the past.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**Background:**
Fiolla was but a baby when she was given up by her family and given over to the Jedi Order, to be taught the ways of the Force. It was under the tutelage of Jedi Instructors and together with other younglings near her own age that she spent her childhood, receiving instruction in basic uses of the force.
At the age of 12 she was deemed ready and was allowed to become a padawan, yet it wasn't until the age of 14 that she found a master or perhaps rather her master found her. Master Seedan Tamory, a human Jedi Knight on the verge of becoming Jedi Master took her as his Padawan Learner. Naster Seedan was a great master, providing Fiolla with plenty of opportunity to pursue her own interests (leaving Tamory to focus on her own interest in mechanics), while still providing support and guidance, teaching the young Padawan about life, the Force and the ways of the Jedi.
A few years and several missions later the Master and Padawan found themselves enroute to the temple on Dantooine when the Sith made their move on the Jedi Order and in the end Master Seedan ended up giving herself to the Force, but her sacrifice allowed Fioalla to escape. She was able to sneak aboard a cargo ship leaving Dantooine, unseen by Sith scouts and went to the moon Nar Shadda, where she was able to survive unseen.
As the months passed on the Smuggler's Moon, Fiolla started to grow a bit disillusioned. Her Master was dead and from the random rumors she picked up, the Jedi Order was no more. She was alone and did not know what to do, never knowing freedom. And the more her despair grew, the harder she found it to focus on using the force to help others, taking care of their wounds. Until one particularly rough day, where she suddenly found herself unable to transfer her own life force, her soul having been tainted by the anger growing within her, about the injustice done to her and the Jedi Order, despite knowing that such thoughts was on the path to the Dark Side.
One particularly frustrating day Fiolla found herself together with one of her few friends, Karmyzz, of a race that Fiolla didn't recognize and never questioned him about. After being hit by a stray shot from some strangers fighting a group of gangers, all without any thought to the innocent bystanders. Fiolla's first thought was to stop their fight, but then she realized just how badly hurt Karmyzz was. She tried to heal him, but at first she failed, but as she grew more frustrated, she grew more angry too and it was from this she found the strength and through rage literally ordered the wounds to close up and so they did.
Once everything calmed down, she had time to think about things and she found herself confused and lost. She had always been told that the Dark Side was bad, instructors, masters, other padawan learners, even as younglings, they were warned about the Dark Side and the destruction it could cause, yet now she found that opening herself to such emotions could heal just the same as the light side.
It took a few days of constant confusion, before she finally decided that despite the dangers, she would need to seek out someone with more knowledge of the force. She hoped for a Jedi Master, someone who had survived, but she would be satisfied with anyone more understanding of the Force and its mysteries.
With the few credits she had saved, she booked passage off Nar Shadda and started her journey through the Galaxy. Her journey led her to a few force users, some knowing a few others and guiding her to those, before she finally found herself in contact with Lanius, who took her under his wings after deeming that she was not unredeemable.
One of the friends of her new Master is a Mandalorian named Ka'ra. When Lanius from time to time goes to do his own business, Fiolla works with this Mandalorian woman. This time however Lanius has sent Fiolla to work with Ka'ra on a special mission.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Elan Aphotic (Xand Night)</span>**
Male Nagai, 26<div style="text-align: right;">
![Officer__by_VuscISM.jpg](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs51/i/2009/303/6/3/Officer__by_VuscISM.jpg)
</div>

**Brief Background:** When is a pirate not a pirate? When he's a Nightsider. Under the leadership of the cunning and ruthless Drehd Night the pirate gang known as the Nightsiders grew to be one of the most feared criminal groups operating in and around the Corellian system. For generations they have retained their stranglehold of power, prestige, and wealth, and have expanded to have influence in the underground throughout most of the known galaxy. In truth the various descendants of the Nightsiders rarely lift a finger any more, leaving the wrongdoing to the many gangs they hold dominion over. The legacy of the Nightsiders is one of wealth and prestige akin to nobility in criminal circles, and by now the descendants of the Night bloodline are for all intents royalty.
Enter Xand Night, the pirate prince.
Xand grew up with everything he could ever want, or so his parents and friends were fond of telling him. Only his private tutor, an Ithorian scholar whom had been bought from slavers expressly to educate the young prince, seemed to feel differently: "you cannot know what you want, master Xand, without experiencing new things. And how could you know if you want what you *do* have, if you've never been given the opportunity to miss it?"
Despite his position as a slave, Alau Mimwen was a good friend to Xand, perhaps recognising his ability to influence the child away from his unfortunate upbringing. He taught the boy well by not just giving answers, but inspiring his young student to find new questions.
Eventually Xand's father began to suspect the Ithorian's influence in his son's new thoughtful nature. The teacher was taken away and killed, though Xand was simply told he had quit. But Xand knew enough about the family business and had learned enough about putting two and two together from Alau to do so now. He wasn't fooled, but he wisely kept his mouth shut.
Shortly thereafter Xand found a new mentor, someone who (thankfully) his father approved of. The Togorian pirate captain Shanha (pictured) was deemed a "good" influence, and he and his crew taught Xand everything they knew. Through experience Xand began to see the attractive side of his family's line of work. He was able to put aside the memory of Alau's execution, and after some years all but forgot it.<div style="text-align: right;">
![Togorian_small.preview.jpg](http://swagonline.net/files/images/Togorian_small.preview.jpg)
</div>

Yet all things considered he still couldn't be satisfied. He had been taught well by Shanha but he was never allowed to *do* anything. It was always "too dangerous to do this" and "let your lessers do that".
But Xand had literally learned *everything* from Shanha. He had been entrusted with the security codes of the Togorian's ship. It was an easy matter to steal it.
Later, when Shanha had grown too hoarse to shout anymore and had little choice but to calm down, he realised exactly how proud he was. True, he lost an arm for his failure and was exiled from the Nightsiders until he had tracked Xand down and brought him home, which did complicate his feelings. On balance though, he *probably* won't kill Xand next time they meet. He thinks.
Xand quickly sold the ship (unfortunately for the new owners, who were dispatched quickly when Shanha managed to track the ship down and recover it) and "went to ground", taking on the new identity Elan Aphotic. He found work for several years on the *Lookabout*, working under captain Gym Kol. He enjoyed the job and experiencing some of the wonders the galaxy had to offer, but inevitably grew tired of "honest" work and resolved to set himself up as a pirate – to get back to his family’s roots, as it were, and experience everything in thrilling first-hand.
**Past Adventures:** Elan's career as a pirate has been short but eventful. His closest call yet was when he bought stolen military supplies and discovered too late that there was a tracking device in with the goods.<div style="text-align: right;">
![the_Officer_by_FROSTconcepts.jpg](http://th05.deviantart.net/fs49/PRE/i/2009/224/8/1/the_Officer_by_FROSTconcepts.jpg)
</div>

He jetissoned that tracker and in a fit of rebellious pique answered an incoming hail from the pursuing vessel, a *Foray*-class frigate known as the *Glorious* commanded by Eleyna Indesqu (pictured). Far from acquiescing to her orders that he not resist, Elan made light of the situation and flirted with the Republic officer.
He proved an able enough pilot to avoid destruction by the frigate's anti-starfighter armanents and take his own ship into hyperspace... although it was a very close thing.
Eleyna would love another chance to capture Elan. For his part, Elan would love another chance to let her try. Not to mention flirt with her again - her angry expression was very cute.
**Personality:** Elan has been many things (pampered prince, eager student, callous criminal, intrepid explorer, dashing pirate...) and still plans to be many more. His personality, then, is a complex thing. He is charismatic and roguish, and often arrogant. Sometimes he seems down-to-earth, and other times he displays the hints of a superiority complex. He is usually quite callous and uncaring, but every so often displays a surprising amount of sensitivity. Not even he really knows what he’ll feel at a given time, and he’s still finding himself. Elan is at a crossroads in life, and it’s anyone’s guess where he’ll end up and what kind of sentient he’ll turn out to be.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** Elan has most recently travelled to Nyriaan, hoping to find a way to score some of the valuable madilon ore.
At first glance Elan may seem a bad fit. But so would Han Solo, and that turned out okay for everyone involved. He will likely become involved in a case of "wrong place, wrong time" or "right place, right time" depending on how you look at it. He is not so attached to the idea of piracy that he couldn't be swept up in events and become a heroic figure (or anti-heroic, at the very least...) providing they give him the excitement and new experiences he craves.

Background
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Born in 3,978 BBY on the Bothan colony world of Kothlis, Burukt was found to be Force-sensitive when a Jedi visited the world on a diplomatic mission. Knowing of his tendency to know things before they happened and the frequency of deja vu in him, his parents contacted the Jedi when he was nearby. The Jedi tested the six-year old and confirmed their suspicions that he was able to be trained. Wanting a better life than they could give him, Burukt's impoverished parents gave him to the Jedi. The feeling of losing something profoundly important and distant images of his parents weeping as they slowly grew smaller in the distance is the earliest memory that Burukt can recall.
He spent the rest of his childhood training on Dantooine in the Jedi enclave there before being moved to the Coruscant temple before he hit adolescence. It was when he was 17 that Caamasi Jedi master Yorenn Vo'lot decided to take him on as an exclusive student, the first for the Jedi so used to the older ways of the Jedi when a single master mentored numerous students.
Vo'lot was primarily a diplomat and recognized the same skills existed in his new Padawan. Throughout his years as a Padawan, Burukt has rarely learned any combat abilities aside from the basics and has focused extensively on solving the galaxy's problems through persuasion, not the blade of a lightsaber.
During the war against the Mandalorians, Burukt was approached privately by an old friend from the Dantooine enclave. His friend argued that the Jedi order's then-current stance on entering the war was wrong and that one Jedi master was recruiting Jedi who "[knew] that the pacifism of the council is wrong." Burukt, however, believed--along with his master--that the council was right to study the issue more. The Bothan tried to convince his friend of their wisdom, only to have a troubling argument break out. He has not seen his friend since, though has heard troubling rumors that he was among the Sith forces of Darth Revan.
Burukt and his master were seldom involved in either war, being sent to numerous planets to only rally support for the Republic and the Jedi, as well as negotiate key deals with independent governments over supply lines.
In days before the Sith resurgance after Revan left, Burukt was still a Padawan, but was increasingly sent on missions away from his master.
In the present, however, the majority of the Jedi have gone underground, Burukt and his master being no exception. Vo'lot and a few younglings assigned to him before the Jedi council disbanded, fled to a planet on the Outer Rim, where the Caamasi has been spending the majority of his time tutoring the younglings. Burukt, however, was separated from his master during the chaos of the disbanding and ended up searching the Outer Rim for where his master was hiding. On a Mid Rim space station, however, he was discovered by a member of the Brotherhood, a splinter group that many of the Order had never heard of save for rumors.
Not entirely sure of them, but having nowhere else to go and still needing vital tutelage in the ways of the Force, Burukt accepted the member's offer to continue his training.

</details>

Personality
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Burukt has always been a studious Jedi, a habit his master has encouraged throughout the years. As such, he is fluent in seven languages and passable in an additional two. When outside of a diplomatic function, he is slightly aloof. His stand on diplomacy first has not lessened from his youth, but he will join a fight if there is no possible alternative.

</details>

Description
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

A light-brown furred Bothan, Burukt stands 1.49 meters tall. On most outside functions, he tends to wear tan Jedi robes that contrasts with his fur. When worried, the fur on the end of his neck tends to twitch, as does his right ear. Burukt keeps the fur growing off of his snout well groomed, as he does the rest of his fur, though he wears no decorations.

</details>

Edit: Fixed a few mistakes pointed out to me.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-01-30 10:37:34)

Just some input and checking of the character here.

* Seems like you should know two more languages (Int 16 gives 3 plus Linguist feat giving 4, and Basic/Bothese are starting, right?)
* Seems like you should have one more trained skill (Int 16 gives 3 extra, plus Skill Training(x2) and the Jedi´s starting 2)
* You seem to be lacking the Weapon Proficiency(Simple) feat

The most striking thing about your character seems to be the last line of your background. To me it sounds like he´s still a padawan in the Jedi Order, being sent on missions by the Council. You may wish to reread Alicia´s campaign summary in the beginning of this thread that states especially that the Jedi Order has been disbanded.

I'm looking for a new cast of players due to a recent stall in the current adventure and the unfortunate nuisance called a real life <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->. The cast will consist of 2-4 characters who need to have some affiliation with the Republic or will at least work for them.
Please see the first post in regards to submitting a character and please feel free to post as many concepts as you wish, the more the better actually as then there will be more ideas to mix and match with to make a unique team.

### **Duggs** (2012-03-22 16:58:24)

I would be interested in this. Would this work as a character concept? The background I tossed together real quick.
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Daegin</span>**
Sex: Male
Race: Jawa
Age: 25
**Brief Background:** While he was still an child his family was killed by Tusken Raiders and he was the only survivor. Luckily for him a some moisture farmers saw all of the wreckage and found him. They took him to Mos Eisley hoping that another clan of Jawas would accept him, and when their search was fruitless they left him with some Mon Calamari workers at the spaceport. He grew up learning about ships and droids from the workers in the spaceport, though most treated him more like a pet than a person, using him to reach places that they could not, or using him to fetch tools and parts for them so that they could continue working. He was given the name Daegin by the workers. He saw many different ships and droids come through the spaceport and when he was finally able to start working for the spaceport he would try to get into as many jobs working on and repairing them as he could. Especially if it was something new that he had never seen before. At times he would get himself into trouble because he would try and tear new tech he saw apart so that he could learn more about it and figure out how it worked. He rarely left the spaceport as he was growing up, which led to him growing rather distant from other Jawas. As a result he tends to be cleaner than other Jawas and because of his life in the spaceport he never got into the habit of dipping his clothes in a rancid soup to help seal in his body's moisture. Then one day his friends, the Mon Calamari that had all but taken him into their home, decided to join up with the republic to help design, and build ships. It was on that day that he decided to sign up with them, though there was a lot of scrutiny at first since he was a Jawa that was trying to sign up to leave Tattooine. So far he has only been given small assignments working on fighter craft or droids because of his size.
**Past Adventures:** Worked in the Mos Eisley Spaceport on numerous starships and droids. After he joined up with the Republic Navy he worked on a few cruisers taking care of their starfighter and droid complements.
**Personality:** Calm and relaxed, but always curious about new tech.
**You're Good at?..:** Mechanics, Slicing, with a minor in piloting.
**You Ended Up Here Because…:** I followed a few really close friends into the Republic Navy and I am enjoying moving from cruiser to cruiser and seeing all kinds of new technology and droids. Recently he was stationed on the Republic Hammerhead cruiser *Titan’s Valiant*.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">L0-V312</span>**
Male Droid A-few-thousands-years-younger-than-you-know-him
**Brief Background:** This is Drexler before he became Galactically reknown as a shockboxer par excellence. So he's much much less of an obnoxious a$$hole...and less independent. Pre-synthskin Drexler.
**Past Adventures:** Only a few short centuries after his creation, Drexler was bought/taken by a very wealthy (and shady) individual. His master put the droids skills to good use and equipped him with numerous different combat modules to suit the specific missions he had in store for L0.
**Personality:** Subserviant, a far cry from the independent droid we al know and love today.
**You're Good at?..:** Everything (sorry force of habbit). "Bladed" combat is the currently equipped module.
**You Ended Up Here Because …** I'm on a mission for my master, who will years later prove to be a Sith Lord. I'm going for Republic-Infiltration-Destruction-from-the-inside-but-maybe-sympathise-and-get-independence-or-the-republic-help-me-realise-independence?

<details><summary>Background</summary>

Pretty much born into the Jedi Order, Yuri has few memories from outside the Temple, and his time spent there has formed him into a person colored a lot by the principles of the Order and its Code. As his training progressed, he proved to be gifted in the art of lightsber combat, and gifted with an ability to catch fleeting insights into the imminent future through the Force, something which most likely aided him in his skill with the blade. Still, he always suspected that there was more to being a Jedi than just those skills, and he would often spend time in various locations of the Temple, meditating for himself and seeking some deeper insight. Eventually he would be approached by a man known for being a deep philosopher and thinker himself, the revered Jedi Watchman and council member Zez-Kai Ell, who would express interest in his abilities, and would take him as his padawan.
Now apprenticed to a master, Yuri discovered another aspect of the Jedis life, the part where he travelled the Galaxy to provide assistance and council where needed. This he enjoyed very much, and he found that even though he had been born into the life, his place in the Galaxy was as a Jedi, serving the people of the Republic. His time with master Ell was most rewarding in his experience, as the wise Jedi would teach him never to rely only on his lightsaber or the Force to resolve a situation, and told him a Jedi resorted to those means only as a last resort. These years were probably the best of his life, as he felt himself doing what he was supposed to do, and doing it well. That would all change, however, when the warlord known as Mandalore the Ultimate made his move into the Galaxy.
The war changed everything, and when the call came from Revan to rally the Order to meet the threat, Yuri was torn. He heard the wisdom of the call, and in his opinion this was his duty as a Jedi, to stand as a shield of the innocent and repel the invaders. Still, he trusted the wisdom of the Council and his master in particular, even though Ell seemed like deep down he wanted to join as well, but for some reason he didn´t. The turning point came when Revan made public knowledge of what had occurred on the planet Cathar, how the Mandalorians had nearly wiped an entire species from th face of the Galaxy and left their planet in ruins. Not able to stand on the side anymore, Yuri left Coruscant and took up the title of Jedi Crusader, joining forces with those already on the front.
Entering the war, Yuri discovered another quality he had yet to see in himself, skill at leadership. Letting his own sense of justice and the Force guide him, his lightsaber would stand alongside republic forces on battlegrounds like Duros and Dxun, and he would even be present when the two fleets finally clashed over Malachor V. Fortunately (as it would turn out), the cruiser he was stationed on were assaulted early in the battle, and while the boarding party was repelled, the ship suffered heavy casualities and were forced to retreat, hanging on the edge of the system when the Mass Shadow Generator were activated, something that most certainly saved it. Still, the sensation that rushed through the Force was incredible, and shook Yuri to his very core. With the war ended, he would quietly slip away from the fleet, becoming lost in the vastness of the Galaxy.
He would not again become involved into the affairs of the Galaxy until a year later, when Revan and Malak returned from Deep Space at the head of a Sith armada. He would be seen spearheading a small mercenary unit fighting against the invaders on various fronts, and eventually his fighting would get him in contact with the Republic forces, and the Jedi who had decided to join with them. Finally, he would stand eye to eye with his master again, ready to accept responsibility for his action. But true to his nature, Zez-Kai Ell would not reprimand his padawan, but he would rather praise him for following his heart and the ways of the Jedi, and told him that he was a living embodiment that perhaos the Council wasn´t always as right as they thought. Leaving the mercenaries to fight the battle in their own way, Yuri rejoined the Jedi and would eventually stand by their side when the war finally ended with Revans redemption. But the war had extracted a cost too heavy for the weakened Order to pay.
In their final conversation, Ell told Yuri that his time had passed, and that he was a Jedi no longer. He would go into exile, and wait for a time of hope, but he would not hold his breath. His final words before he departed was “Even if the Jedi will one day be reborn, the errors of the past must not be repeated, or history will repeat itself. The future rest on the shoulders of you and your kind, my apprentice”. And with this he informally bestowed upon Yuri the title of Jedi Knight, and then left him to find his own place in the Galaxy. And so he did, wandering the Galaxy as a bounty hunter, making sure the ideals of the Jedi remained alive, seeking for trails of the remaining Sith and ways to bring them down, and biding his time for when the Jedi would be needed again.

</details>

<details><summary>Appearance</summary>

Yuri has the appearance of a fit human male in his mid-twenties. While he is not overwhelmingly muscular, he is in quite good shape, and he is capable of exerting himself physically for quite a while before having to call upon the Force to assist him, unlike many other Jedi. Up until very recently, he kept his head shaved, but he has since allowed a short stub of hair grow out, though he still keeps his facial hair in check. Well aware that the Galaxy is a dangerous place for Jedi at ther moment, he has adopted a plain, dark clothing, complete with a military-style camouflage poncho, which he usually wear outside-in, to keep its pattern-shifting qualities from attracting attention to him. Since his identity as a Jedi was revealed to those closest around him, he has started wearing his old Jedi robes when in a somewhat more safe environment. The robes are of the more ceremonial cut, the traditional dark brown shades being replaced by white and beige.

<details><summary>Captain Hussk, Commanfing officer of the Wild Sabers</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>Zarim, Outlaw scum and information broker</summary>

**Background** One of the many lowlifes that calls the Smuggler´s Moon home, Zarim was once saved by Yuri from a band of aggressive pirates that apparently didn´t find the Toydarians information to be good enough, and saw fit to express their discontent violently. This created a relationship where Zarim would offer his services and goods to Yuri, and be especially on the alert for any information regarding Jedi or Sith. Miraculously enough, the Toydarian have kept Yuris identity safe, though their relationship has moved away from Zarim owing him anything, and is now more of a business relationship, though usually Yuri can coax the shameless little creature in giving him a better deal than his regular customers.
**Personality** Zarim is defined primarily by three traits: Greed, cunning and cowardice. He has no regrets about being involved in pretty much any kind of business - even though Yuri has managed to get him to back off from the more immoral operations (like slave trade) – as long as he makes money. He knows where to poke his eyes and ears to get results, and takes confidence in that he is protected by the vast amount of knowledge he holds. When provoked though, he is easily scared into submission, even though he manages to keep most people who would like to hurt him at bay by a combination of knowing things about them, and providing them services. Surprisingly enough for such a shady character, he has a strong sense of integrity, and has so far not revealed Yuris identity to anyone.
**Uses** Zarim is quite well-connected on the Smuggler´s Moon, and if there is some piece of information circulating there, it is very likely that he will eventually hear of it. Likewise, he has his fingers in more than a few smuggling and black market operations, making him capable of producing nearly anything...at a price of course. A price that may be pretty steep, even though the Toydarian can get a hold of almost anything at a reduced price.

## Re: [OR] Growing Shadows (OPEN)

### **Alicia** (2012-03-23 15:35:39)

As it seems there’s now a wide variety of applicants and in an effort to figure out how, as a group, we want to proceed. Here’s some information which may affect what sort of characters are submitted.
I apologize for not doing this at the forefront as I certainly know better, but with a little more thought I believe previous submissions can be adapted to better suit the campaign’s direction.
The current story, if you haven’t been following along, currently consists of two groups, which would be essential in impacting the plotline. It would be best to decide as a group whether you want to participate in one faction or the other. From there it can be decided what the groups goal and reason for coming together will be.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**The Brotherhood**</span>
Best described as a splinter sect of Jedi, it was founded by Jut-hakk as an alternative to the Jedi Order at the end of the Great Sith War. Formed away from the watching eye of the Republic and Jedi Order, Jut-hakk recruited stray Jedi who had lost faith in the Order due to contrary beliefs or because of the wars (Great Sith War, Mandalorian War and Jedi Civil War) as well as other Force Users members happened to come across. Acting as a community of various beliefs, the Brotherhood has no set tenets its members are required to follow aside from one: Preservation of Knowledge. This is accomplished through the teaching of apprentices, sharing of knowledge through archival and scientific pursuits or the gathering of texts and artifacts.
Over the past century, the Brotherhoods numbers have grown to not only include a wide arrange of Force Users but also soldiers and other support personnel who assist in maintaining and protecting the numerous hidden holdings throughout the Outer Rim. Members of the Brotherhood would be welcome to bring their family and many may have been born into the sect.
Most recently Jut-hakk has expended resources in tracking down and preserving artifacts and any knowledge garnered by the Jedi Order. The most recent news involves an incident at Acheron research station where due to a mechanical error in the power generator the station was destroyed. While most of the personnel escape, Master Jut-hakk, his apprentice Davian, lieutenant Master Lanius, his apprentice Fiolla Narcassan, the Mandalorian Ka’ra Bralor and a shuttle with all hands from Lanius’s governance of Telia IV is still unaccounted for.
**Getting Involved** Members of this sect come from all walks of life, united in their one common purpose: the preservation of knowledge. Force Users in particular find solace in this group whether they are joining as an alternative to the Jedi Order or have left the Order and seek further knowledge and companionship. Support personnel in the form of soldiers and mechanics could easily find work along with their families.
With recent events, a team could be dispatched to investigate the disappearances of Jut-hakk and the others as well as the destruction of the station.
Additionally, while most aren’t aware of Jut-hakk’s current activities, the heroes could be working to further his goals. (see 2nd paragraph of Splinter Group)
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Splinter Group**</span>
Led by Lanius and Ka’ra Bralor and formed to subvert Jut-hakk’s malevolent plans, members brought in were originally from outside of the Brotherhood hired for their discretion and willingness. As Lanius attempts to bring the truth of Jut-hakk’s agenda to light, starting with those living at Telia V, more have come to his aid. The base of Telia V is nearly fully under his control.
The truth as Lanius tells it is he was commissioned by Jut-hakk to learn the location of an artifact used by Exar Kun during the Great Sith War. Able to absorb the life energy out of anything it came in contact with, the artifact known as the Force Harvester could be used as a power source for a powerful weapon. While he doesn’t know Jut-hakk’s full intentions, Jut-hakk has made comments leading him to believe the aging Zabrak wants to unleash it upon the Galaxy.
Having recovered the Force Harvester with the help of a special team from Jut-hakk’s grasp on Acheron, he is now working to either destroy it or find a safe location to hide while at the same time ensuring Jut-hakk’s allies are unable to further their master’s goals.
**Getting Involved** Members of the team need to have some motivation in assisting Lanius in ensuring that the recovered Force Harvester remains safe. They can be allies from the Republic Hammerhead cruiser *Titan’s Valiant* on special (and secret) assignment by Captain Niandra Prius, or they can be from the Brotherhood having heard Lanius’s tale and decided to join. Additionally, they could have come from outside, hired by Ka’ra to provide a special service the team may be lacking.

I would be fine with either group, but I lean more towards the splinter group as a hired on Mechanic/Slicer.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-26 19:35:00)

In an effort to make some progress on this part, it sounds like we all agree that the splinter group would be the one we join?
For myself, I could see Keith crossing paths with Lanius in some way, and the latter recruiting him, possibly out of some familiarity from their respective time as Jedi. Keith have been wandering the Galaxy since the end of the last war, and it would seem possible that the Force managed to get him inside Lanius´s scope of attention, or someone else from within the splinter group. Lacking a current purpose as he is, he would have no complains about signing on once he learns what the group is trying to accomplish. After all, he is determined to stand ready when the time comes for the resurrection of the Jedi, and in the meanwhile he will fight to keep people like Jut-hakk from casting a shadow over that name.

## Re: [OR] Growing Shadows (OPEN)

### **Duggs** (2012-03-26 21:14:10)

I agree with the Splinter group. I could see my guy coming in because he was selected as a mechanic to work on the Hammerhead cruiser *Titan’s Valiant*.

### **Rabidgiraffe1922** (2012-03-29 20:45:39)

I'm presently continuing my efforts to flesh out the background. I wanted to submit a character idea so I might be considered to join. After reading the splinter group description, I am curious if it would be possible for my character to join the group as an intel specialist sent in by Ka'ra?
Riskyr Eshka'pek
Sex: Male
Race: Bothan
Age: 32
Brief Background: As a child he was particularly good at hiding in a game akin to the human Hide and Seek. Growing up learning the ways of the clan he picked up leeching information from targets as easily as a bothan can. As an adult Riskyr is always open to earning extra credits on the side, even if that means dealing with the shadier side of society and collecting on bounties.
Personality:Quiet, Serious, A touch paranoid.
You're Good at?: Infiltration, Gathering Information, Piloting.
You Ended Up Here Because: Presently searching for intelligence to aid his clan while pursuing his own interests in making a name for himself either in fame or infamy.

Sorry for my unresponsiveness.
As it appears you all are indeed interested in the Splinter group we will proceed from there. I've been in contact with some of you, and so far the concepts look promising. I'll be in touch to fill in details relevant to your submissions and hopefully we'll be ready to get the ball rolling.
If you haven't already, please update the concepts with how the character might have become affiliated with the Splinter group.

Male Miraluka Jedi 5 / Noble 1
&quot;*All of reality is a canvas to me. I am the brush, the Living Force is my palette&#8230; and the gallery? The gallery is your mind.*&quot;
</div>

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ooru Okin was born the illegitimate son of representative Jor Okin by one of many mistresses. Like his half-brothers and sisters, he never met his parents and was raised instead by Jor's private nurses at a country estate. Unlike them, his mother was a Human and, thanks to her, he had actual eyes. They were vestigial and didn't work, themselves clouded over to give an eery visage to an already odd child. The nurses could tell something was even more uncommon about Ooru though, and after a while many simply refused to be near him. Hallucinations, voices, irrational behavior - these were commonplace for anyone who spent enough time in his presence. The Luka Sene was finally contacted on his fifth birthday when, to the amazement of the nurse staff, he made them all look like each other. It took some time to sort it all out but he was finally whisked away with a guarantee of safety - for everyone. Few ever knew of his true appearance because his face was often covered in traditional Miraluka fashion. Not even his teachers at the academy were aware of his mixed heritage.
As Ooru grew during his time at the institution he realized the unique nuances of his special "Force Sight" - the ability of all Miraluka to perceive their surroundings despite no optical organs - and the nature of his connection to the Living Force. He had a natural aptitude for the aspects of the Force that involved perception and understanding and, through meditation and guided training, learned to control the abilities. Ooru enjoyed studying ancient civilizations and mythologies and in time was able to read a wide array of languages with ease. His interest went beyond the cultures though, and he often adapted what he read for use in his illusions. It became a regular occurence to see Ooru Okin's latest re-enactment of some forgotten battle or long-lost expedition in the halls of the Luka Sene academy. The show was made all the more interesting by his inability to perceive colors naturally - something unexpected but somehow fitting in the young artist. Watching his ghostly pale actors and actresses parade among the shadows of bygone eras was no less enjoyable for their lack of hue.
Ooru loved learning about everything, but particularly life and its many processes. The intricate balance of a body's systems and how each part worked in such harmony was the source of neverending wonder for the young Miraluka. He would often impress his professors by sitting in their classes and providing a detailed construct of an individual system while they taught younger students. One of the few friends he would ever have, a blind Zeltron girl named Vyrna, was more interested in technologies. Though the Luka Sene is typically for Miraluka only, Vyrna's minor nobility and Force sensitivity were welcomed at the academy. They met during class where, to everyone's amazement, Vyrna began to explain the benefits of cybernetic replacements over natural grafts - not a very popular view among Force sensitives. Ooru listened intently, then re-worked his construct to incorporate her suggestions. It was the beginning of a friendship on a level few in the galaxy would ever experience. The two spent countless hours sharing their knowledge, and hearts, through telepathic conversations. It was actually Vyrna who alerted Ooru to the dangerous consequences of his recent studies.
While pouring over old records of ancient traditions, Ooru discovered a small trove of Sith knowledge in the academy archives. It was only a few glyphs and a manuscript, but he spent the better part of a month finding out all he could about the scraps of a history best left forgotten. It was a dark path to walk and he was careful to not delve too deeply. It nonetheless gave him some new and terrible ideas about the use of his powers. Before he could complete his research the academy learned of Ooru's interest in the Sith and determined to confront him about it. Vyrna heard the rumors and, judging her friend was in greater danger from the Sene Seekers than from any scroll, warned him of the academy's plans. Ooru left within the hour with no more than a fleeting telepathic goodbye. He was able to escape the grounds without being noticed and sought passage off-planet at the nearest spaceport. For several he wandered from system to system, continuing his studies as much as possible but always wary of being discovered.
Ooru Okin was contacted about joining Jut-hakk's Brotherhood after narrowly escaping some Sene Seekers that had followed him back to Alpheridies. He was meeting with his childhood companion, Vyrna, who had recently left the academy and would soon be taking a position as one of the planet's lead cyberneticists. The two enjoyed their reunion and soon lapsed into a telepathic conversation like they used to do in years past. The Seekers interrupted and before long Ooru had to flee his homeworld once more - but not before the ember of childhood friendship had been fanned into something more. It was another bittersweet departure but not, they promised, a permanent one. His first year in the Brotherhood was spent under young Master Davian's tutelage from whom he learned to hone his Force abilities and to study some of its basic telekinetic applications. Though it took a great deal of concentration, Ooru eventually learned how to perceive colors and use them in his illusions through guided meditation. His second mentor - Master Tonin, Davian's twin brother - preferred a more direct approach to life's challenges. The twins also gifted Ooru with his robe and lightsaber pike - the trimmings of a great warrior worthy of the Brotherhood. He was deeply honored to be welcomed in any setting for the first time in his memory, and he bore both with great pride. While the majority of his brethren spent their time lifting stones with their minds and participating in saber duels, Ooru perfected his ability to manipulate others' perceptions - and he's became very good at it.

**<Playback mode activated>**
*By the time you receive this report I will be on Alpheridies. You've surely heard about Davian, believe me when I say I did everything I could think of to revive him. I have to admit, however, that his condition may be partially due to my own reckless actions aboard the derelict shuttle where we encountered Master Jut-Haak. It was… difficult. Lanius' burns have healed but the burden on my own conscience remains. I don't know what else you've heard so I'll just recount as best I can.
I updated you about halfway through my mission when I had met with little success. Eventually we were able to trace Davian to a small craft drifting among the asterooids near where Acheron Base had been. We decided to enter the ship, cautiously, and immediately discovered signs of struggle - such as it was. The two pilots' corpses were still strapped in and had clearly been injured through The Force rather than any physical weapon. I sent an illusionary figure of Lanius down into the bay below to spring any waiting ambush, to which we were met with the unmistakable laughter of Jut-Haak. We proceeded slowly, only to find Davian's body on the deck of the bay - and no one else. He gasped for air and recognized me - briefly - before Jut-Haak worked his trickery over Davian's body and the confrontation began. In the end it was Lanius perseverance more than anything I did that allowed us to leave still breathing. I stabalized Davian and Lanius brought us back here to Telia V. It's been a full day since our return and after a great deal of meditation and introspection I have decided that I must rectify events from my past. The Sene Seekers aren't likely to give up searching and it just may turn out that The Force has a better plan for me than whatever I might come up with on my own. I can't hope to defeat whatever Master Jut-Haak has become if I'm bring haunted by ghosts in my own past.
I sincerely hope this meets with your approval… and understanding. Nothing could change my devotion to you, Davian, or the Brotherhood. I fear, though, that my own shortcomings may endanger us all if not reconciled. I will be in touch as necessary. Ooru out.*
**<Recording concluded>**
Ooru's decision to return to Alpheridies and face his accusers at the Luka Sene has met with many unexpected - but not unwelcome - surprises. The administration was understanding of his fears and applauded his facing them rather than burying them deep - a sure path to the Dark Side. His confession, and subsequent forgiveness, freed Ooru to pursue a less self-centered path. That, however, was only one reason to return to his homeworld. Vyrna, now a well-known cyberneticist specializing in life-saving technologies, was excited to finally have some uninterrupted time with Ooru. The two shared many things together, sometimes in pleasant conversation, sometimes in quiet meditation, always growing closer. Ooru decided on a few more changes he hadn't anticipated as well: He stopped wearing the traditional Miralukan head covering and let his piercing eyes be seen freely. He left his black and orange robe and saberpike, gifts from Davian and Tonin, back on Telia V and chose a more humble attire. A special silver lightsaber - a gift from Vyrna - is the only weapon he now carries. He keeps the Kinrath barb that once very nearly killed him stored in its hilt - a reminder of his own mortality. The purposeful expulsion of Sith teachings from his mind resulted in his growing in the understanding of The Living Force, and he has gained the use of Force-assisted healing and an increased ability to perceive the environment around him - among other new abilities. Clarity has come to Ooru Okin and he is now ready to face his destiny, whatever it may be.

**Appearance**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ooru Okin is a 25-year-old Miralukan of athletic build. His muscle lays taught across his thin frame and, while he by no means would boast of amazing strength or agility, he has a certain attractiveness in his wiry, almost elven, appearance. His hair hangs loose around his shoulders, well-kept and dark. Ooru's hybrid genetics grant him a pair of solid black eyes, setting him quite apart from his fellow Miralukans. They are vestigial - a result of his Human mother's physiology - and few knew of their existence until recently. Like windows into some bottomless chasm, they lend him an alien appearance unsurpassed in its savage beauty. He is content to dress comfortably in a simple tunic and pants as well, shunning fashion for function out of a desire to both rebel against the status quo and be able to blend into a crowd as best as possible.
When on assignment for the Brotherhood he wears a black hooded robe with deep orange trim - a gift from Master Davian. His lightsaber pike was a gift from Master Tonin, and it's dark handle and bright orange blade rarely see much combat. When not active it simply completes the picture of a stereotypical blind traveler. It's an image he encourages, since his dismissal often avoids unnecessary confrontation. More recently, however, he has shunned their use in a sort of self-imposed exile from the Brotherhood whereby he hopes to resolve a number of dangers to both it and those he cares about most. He travels light - what doesn't fit in his medical pack goes into his belt. When things get intense those nearby discover an intriguing - and sometimes frightening - manifestation of Ooru's powers. His appearance is often reflective of his mood: subliminal and emotional currents impact his attire and surroundings visibly. The result only adds to his already mysterious countenance and unmistakable presence.

Was waiting to see if I would get a response from rapidgirrafe concerning their entry. Since I haven't his concept is no longer under consideration.
BW, Duggs, JB and DA, you may now move onto the next step of creating your completed character sheet. Feel free to use the post from your concept to submit it.
I do require a level breakdown the format of which I'll put up tonight after work if it's not already up on the first post. Please keep in mind my house rules when writing up.
Character will be level 6.

### **Alicia** (2012-04-14 10:52:20)

I put the level breakdown with the [Character Creation rules in the Regulations thread](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=191&t=24651&p=49776#p49776 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=191&t=24651&p=49776#p49776"). Let me know if you have further questions.
Keep in mind if you are not a Force user you don't need the Force Powers known portion. Essentially it's to help you keep track what you gain at each level. you can make it an accumulated list, just make sure to italicize or underline what you take that level to make it easier to differentiate what you've earned.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Daegin**</span>
Male Jawa Scoundrel 6
</div>

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

While he was still an child his family was killed by Tusken Raiders and he was the only survivor. Luckily for him a some moisture farmers saw all of the wreckage and found him. They took him to Mos Eisley hoping that another clan of Jawas would accept him, and when their search was fruitless they left him with some Mon Calamari workers, Oro and Jesmin Till, at the spaceport. He grew up learning about ships and droids from the workers in the spaceport, though most treated him more like a pet than a person, using him to reach places that they could not, or using him to fetch tools and parts for them so that they could continue working. He was given the name Daegin by the workers. He saw many different ships and droids come through the spaceport and when he was finally able to start working for the spaceport he would try to get into as many jobs working on and repairing them as he could. Especially if it was something new that he had never seen before. At times he would get himself into trouble because he would try and tear new tech he saw apart so that he could learn more about it and figure out how it worked. He rarely left the spaceport as he was growing up, which led to him growing rather distant from other Jawas. As a result he tends to be cleaner than other Jawas and because of his life in the spaceport he never got into the habit of dipping his clothes in a rancid soup to help seal in his body's moisture. Then one day his friends, the Mon Calamari that had all but taken him into their home, decided to join up with the Republic to help design, and build ships. Shortly after his friends had left Tattooine to work with the Republic Navy he was approached by Ka'ra and offered a job as a mechanic. Since the only people that he had seen as his family had already left for bigger and better things he decided that it was his turn to leave Tattooine in search for bigger and better things, and of course for new tech that he can tear apart and work on. Though his work on Telia seems slower that working in a spaceport he fills his time with studying tech and he feels that he is allowed to do more since he doesn't have someone constantly over his shoulder yelling at him to get ships, and droids, fixed in a hurry.

</details>

**Appearance**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Standing at only a meter tall and weighing in at 28 kilograms, he is average height but somewhat slender for a Jawa. Unlike most Jawas he does not wear the traditional brown robes. He can normally be found in mechanics coveralls, gloves, boots and a pair of tinted goggles that helps to protect his eyes, their orange glow can still be seen through them. He has a utility belt wrapped around his waist and a holster carrying an ion blaster can be seen on his right hip. A Vox-box can be seen strapped to his left forearm. To a human his face might remind them of a mouse's, or rodent's, face though his ears are proportional to his head, similar to a humans ears and their head. He is covered in short dark grey fur.

Backgrounds: They were the Mon Calamari that took Daegin in and helped show him how to work on ships and droids. They see him as though he is a son of theirs. Shortly after they joined up with the Republic Navy as Starship designers, and repairers, Daegin decided to go off on his own. They are both smart and creative, and can usually be found together, they seem to work best as a team. They treat designing starships as though they are working on pieces of art. Oro is seen as more of a dreamer, coming up with designs that almost look impractical. He is also very inquisitive. Jesmin is quieter and likes working with computers and droids. She seems to have a natural motherly attitude towards anyone that she works with for an extended amount of time. Though their skills are practically the same Jesmin takes pride in working with the inner workings and coding for computers, while Oro is very proud, and very much enjoys, his work on starship design.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Arrathor**</span>
Male Ithorian (Venerable) Noble 1 / Jedi 5
</div>

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Once a well renown Priest and healer on a herdship, Arrathor tended to much plant life, conducting various forms of research and study on the flora. He concocted numerous salves and remedies to help aid his Ithorian comrades all in the aid of Mother Jungle and would sometimes hear her call and visit Ithor itself. It was on such a trip that he fell from grace. While communing with a small Baffor grove, Arrathor spied a group of poachers, disrupting the natural ecosystem of his beloved planet by digging up the trees, seeing only their crystalline properties as a source of quick wealth.
To the wails of the trees, begging Arrathor to leave the situation be, the reckless Ithorian summoned the force and hurled a torrent of energy at his opponents. It was over in an instant, their bodies cracked and broken lay slumped against a nearby boulder. Arrathor returned to the herdship and it wasn't long before he announced his exile, knowing full well that he had broken the pacifistic rules of his society, even if it was for the good of his research and planet.
He heard of a centre of learning, The Brotherhood, where he could research in peace...and not just research plant life. He knew of his powers with the Force but had never saught formal training for them, everything he knew was passed around the other seers on the herdships. Having never used a weapon and in a way still wanting to shy away from combat as a whole, he focused on research into telekinetic aspects of the Force, alongside his central research into universal flora. If push came to shove, he was sure he could defend himself, for how long? He didn't know and didn't really want to find out either.
On Telia, he could use the resources of others to seek his goals, often calling on the help of others to help him find items of interest offworld and his requests were often obliged, only very rarely having to fulfill them himself, but it was a welcome break to change the fetid library air that circulated his lungs.
Now in the winter of his life, his dedication to telekinetic manipulation has paid off, now just needing to rely on his mental strength instead of his physical.

</details>

**Appearance**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Piles of loose robes shroud this frail Ithorian. His height is nowhere near what it once was in his prime, his figure distorted by gravity, old age and a life time of work behind a desk. Once proud strides have been replaced by a shuffle without the air of a walking stick. The once glossy sheen to his tan coloured skin, now a dull matte complexion, from which two barely open black eyes peered out underneath.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-05-01 18:14:02)

I´ve updated my post again, finishing up the favor section, barring stats, which are almost complete. Using the credits I got from scratch, plus some of those gained from leveling up and the mission reward, I did get the levels I had originally set for them (CL8 & 4), with 4.700 Cr left over.
I also took advantage of the retraining rules and retrained WP(Pistols) into Skill Training(Knowledge(Tactics)). I think it better represents the military skills and abilities he picked up as a soldier. And so far in the story he hasn´t performed any spectacular feats with a gun that can´t be explained by him using the Force.
Let me know if there´s anything else I need to fix, or if I´m ready to go.
