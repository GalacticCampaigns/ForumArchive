# [SAGA Inf]Star Wars: Harbingers (Casting Call)

### **thkaal** (2013-01-31 06:13:33)

Deadline to have characters: February 22, 2013
Beginning Date: February 25, 2013
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">It has been twenty-five years since Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader both died in the cloud city of Bespin. Leia spent many years in seclusion with the Mandalorians being taught by Yoda&#39;s spirit. She founded a new council. She married Han Solo. They now have three children. The ranks of the Jedi are now growing slowly under Leia&#39;s tutelage as well as those who sought her teachings.
The Empire has not been idle. Thirty-six Death Stars were built and quickly used to bring the galaxy under heel. Only the most rimward worlds have been spared. The Rebellion, allied with the Mandalorians and other nomadic peoples, have been fighting back making slow and careful strikes. The emperor sends his new apprentice, the young and deadly Darth Thanasia, to hunt down the Jedi also known more openly as the Medians. But, the successful strikes on a Death Star and five out of six shipyards, a surge of confidence and purpose fills the Rebellion.
However, two robed individuals have been spotted at the more important battles between the Empire and the Rebellion. They are known as the Dark Twins, the Seers, and the Forsaken. But to the Jedi Council, they are known as . . . The Harbingers.</span>
[The Series Timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fZ2FkzBVeueiRLfkqcVyG597E3lBeSfZv22YHgoq_ck/edit "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fZ2FkzBVeueiRLfkqcVyG597E3lBeSfZv22YHgoq_ck/edit")
**Level:** 1 (Extra levels can be earned for a well written background up to level 7. An estimate would be at least two hundred words in the background per level. This is not a guarantee. Submit Level 1 character sheet with story and then I'll tell you additional levels.)
**Build:** 30 points
**Hit Points:** Level 1 is maximum. Full hit points per level.
**Start Wealth:** 1000c per level.
**Used Books:** All
**Custom Races:** If you wish to run an original race, you must have a write up for the world, the culture, as well as a history comparable to a country's entry in the Encyclopedia Britannic. (Yes, I'm saying you must earn it.)
***Additional Notes***
**Infinities Setting:** This is a setting based on a possible extrapolation based on "something" happening differently between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.
**Custom Classes:** Certain "classes" are mentioned in the timeline. These are not true classes, but are names of those with certain abilities and interests. A list of the minimum requirements will be provided for those seeking entrance into the "class."
**Technological Advances:** Rebellion era vehicles are considered Archaic. Personal equipment of the Rebellion Era is also 50% off and -4 to all stats when compared to modern equipment (ie. an archaic blaster firing against modern armor is -4 to damage).
**Hybrid Game:** The game will be played on the forum for the roleplaying portion. However, mission combat will be played on OpenRPG. (This means we'll schedule it ahead of time).
**Post Frequency:** I will be checking the board on M-W-F.

Looks like I might need some modifications to my original stats. They were made over a year ago for this after all. Can't wait to get started!

Thanks Alicia, very nice site indeed.
Hey there thkaal <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Regarding your statement:
> **thkaal wrote:**
>
> &quot;Level: 1 (Extra levels can be earned for a well written background up to level 7. An estimate would be at least two hundred words in the background per level. This is not a guarantee.)&quot;

A few questions for you:
How will this be weighted, I understand that you wrote "at least two hundred words in the background per level" but sometimes quality outweighs quantity.
Would it be advisable to submit the story before the stats, therefore not assuming the levels?
How long do you plan to keep the casting call open?
What are you expecting for a post rate?

---

### **thkaal** (2013-01-31 13:28:50)

I edited the explanation for future readers. But basically, submitting a level 1 character with the back story and then I'll make a judgement based on the story as to how many levels to grant. This does not mean that you simply assume assume the levels. If you have a goal level, write the struggle to attain that level, but leave it open that you might not be there yet.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-02-14 18:41:34)

After some consideration, I think that my like of infinites outweighs my dislike of ORPG combat, so I will submit a character for this game. I do however have a few questions, mainly regarding money and equipment.
Under starting wealth you have written "1000 Cr per level". I have to ask, does this include 1st level, and if it does, why? Frankly, I would find that a bit unfair and biased in favor of Jedi characters. I was planning on a commando soldier/war veteran type of character, and there is a reason Soldiers have a higher starting credit amount than 1000 Cr. If I want to start out with something heavier than a regular blaster pistol (very reasonable assumption for a soldier), that pretty much takes all my credits. In fact, if I want to buy a rifle to start with, I can´t even afford a sling to carry it in. And like I said, it is biased in favor of Jedi - they lose 17% of their normal starting credits while Nobles lose a whooping 79% and everyone else loses 67%. Plus, Jedi also get their most expected (and expensive) possession for free, while most other people can barely scratch together the very minimum of things they would reasonable be assumed to carry. If you want to run a low-credits campaign that´s fine, but I would suggest that you at least let characters get max of their normal starting credits at 1st level, and then 1000 Cr for every additional level.
I also had some questions about your equipment rules, what exactly are considered Rebellion Era equipment? Also, can it be refitted (as per the rules on pg 31, *Legacy*) to lose the penalties?

---

### **thkaal** (2013-02-16 16:10:03)

In truth, the campaign does favor Jedi. However, to your other points, the 1000 Cr is your personal equipment. The things you are concerned about will be taken care of in game. I know you do not know me, but I have story elements that will answer all of your questions. I do, however, need to see a history to make the adjustments to make the appropriate subplots. The money situation is understood and already prepared for. There are some items that will be granted based on your background, some will be handed over to you simply because of a plotline that will be in the game. The 1000 Cr was a difficult decision, but I decided to take the lowest value and then adjust upwards. I ask for your patience and trust so that you will be receiving all you should start with for your class.
Refits are possible, yes. Rebellion Era equipment is anything seen in the movies. X-wings are antiquated, as is the bowcaster Chewie used. For the most part, if you buy an item as is in the book, it is using current technology of the game. This rule was used mostly for heirloom items from the movies. It's more flavor than anything else. Most people aren't going to want it unless they want an item specifically from one of the movies.

Good, I kind of suspected/hoped this was the chosen approach, but didn´t want to assume antyhing, and just in case it wasn´t, voice an opinion on it. It´s not that I´m going to want some super rare and tricked out equipment to start with, but it´s nice not to have to depend on the GM to be able to give a commando soldier a weapon, some armor and a few spare ammo clips <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
I do have some nice ideas for his equipment, but it´s nothing a character with some mechanics skills and credits can´t fix on the run.

Nice surprise about this shorter form. Can you tell us what it is you are talking/writing about?
Has any info. about this shorter form been posted before (and i just missed it)?

### **Ryder2101** (2013-02-19 11:43:56)

This looks like an interesting adventure. Not familiar with the timeline very well but looks very interesting. Will work on a character and background tonight when I'm back on my PC. Limited with what I can do on mobile.

Ryder, looks like you're missing your first level feat.
Languages you get basic + int mod. So you can pick 2!
You have 1 too many skills (scoundrels get 4+ int 2 + racial 1 =7)

Probably mis counted last night on the skills. Did notice earlier the sheet I linked didn't have the final updates. Must not have saved. Was supposed to have Rodese as 2nd language. Will look at it and make the necessary corrections when I get back on PC after school.
Did send GM correct info using sheet build from guide on forum.

Ya that's probably the thing I don't like about myth weavers... No auto save.

I love the ease of creation, since most of the sheet is auto filled. Must not have waited long enough after hitting save last night before closing browser.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-02-20 23:45:12)

So fixed and put in last of info on char sheet. Here it is in the forum's format. Had to adjust a few things based on required change via rules. I double checked everything as I scrubbed it and hoped I didn't over look something when I was looking towards the future of the character.

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Grew up as the son of traders Xavier Ryder and Kiera Storm with his younger sister Elisa Storm-Ryder on the *Eliall*-class cargo barge *Blue Horizon*. At age 14 the ship was attacked and boarded by space lane pirates. In the confusion of the attack one of the other crew members on board managed to hide themselves, Ryder, and one other in a shielded compartment hidden in one of the ship's corridors. When they exited the compartment they found the ship heavily damaged and adrift. Everyone else on board had been killed but they could not find his mother or sister and one other female crew member. They feared the worse, capture for sale into slavery. They worked for two weeks trying to repair the hopelessly damaged engines and failing life support. As what was left of the ship's rations and supplies began to run dangerously low they were rescued by another passing freighter which brought them to the nearby Galidraan System where they parted ways. One crew member decided to hire onto another freighter that was passing through while Darin Dymos took charge of Ryder and settled into the world's seedier element.
Over time Ryder discovered an almost natural knack for picking pockets and small time cons. He made a poor living moving from one mark to another before becoming a low level enforcer for a local gang. He quickly became known as the “Good Luck Charm” from his eerie ability to sense danger when in potentially dangerous jobs, which lead to the near mishap one day when he was twenty-one. His boldness and ego had gotten the better of him and he had ignored the feeling he had and was nearly caught in a raid by local officials. He managed to escape off planet and out of the system but the event caused a turning point in his life. He became regretful of the things he had done, and the deception he had pulled on so many for the quick credit. He began to pay attention more closely to the details of the galaxy and how events were turning out for the Empire and the Rebellion. News of multiple Death Stars burned him to the core, and a hatred began to grow for the Empire.
Moving from odd job to odd job, system to system, he turned his focus now on making an honest credit and looking for his lost loved ones. With little skills under his belt, except for a gift for gab and an near sixth sense ability to detect danger, he found little information towards his mother and sister, or the pirates that had abducted them. The time difference was just too great, and too far from memory in the local systems. He decided he would begin saving in an attempt to purchase his own ship legally and follow in his parents footsteps and hope for better opportunities. When the time was right, he began to think, he would find a way to secretly assist the rebellion, hopefully before it failed completely if he was to believe the Imperial Propaganda that was being spread through every holo-news network.

### **Alicia** (2013-02-21 22:25:41)

You forgot to include Precise Shot with your feats in the stat block. Otherwise it checks out mechanically.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-02-22 00:15:55)

Edited and added. Thank you for double checking my work. Looking back on the back story maybe I could have been a bit more descriptive at some points. Or maybe it's just to over used? Not really sure.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-02-22 01:11:29)

Well, you seem to be short one language, and you have missed to add your level bonus to defenses, so they should all go up by 1. Also, I count your stats to a 32 point buy.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-02-22 09:09:22)

Hrm. Thought it was only two langs. Must of miss interpreted the book. The defenses would have auto updated when I adjusted the sheet on weavers so I didn't think about putting those in for future levels.
Definitely will adjust the attributes when I get home. Triple checked those and still off. *sigh*
***edit***
Just checked attributes again. I'm getting 30 point buy in if using base of 8 for each attribute.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-02-22 16:48:32)

You get two bonus languages from Int, but you get Basic for free
Not really sure what you mean by not adding in defenses for future levels, but they are all off by 1
I count 2+10+3+6+4+8 = 33 in cost for your attributes (did you change Con, or was it always 11 and not 10?)

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-02-22 17:11:19)

Dex is 8+8=16 and Cha is 8+7=15. When I was double checking I got 29 so I added 1 to Con because it wouldn't alter any other stats
Will look at list of languages and select another tonight.
As for the defenses I see weaver didn't calc 1st level in. So I'll fix it. Adjusted sheet here.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-02-22 17:32:55)

According to my stat tool DA is right in that your current listing of 10, 16, 11, 14, 12, 15
Gets you a point buy of 33
<!-- m -->[http://swrpgrc.com/statTool/](http://swrpgrc.com/statTool/ "http://swrpgrc.com/statTool/")<!-- m --> is what I'm using.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-02-22 17:39:51)

Now I see what the issue was. It costs 2 points to go from 15 to 16. Dropped Dex to 15 and Con back 10. Adjusted other stats that changed.
