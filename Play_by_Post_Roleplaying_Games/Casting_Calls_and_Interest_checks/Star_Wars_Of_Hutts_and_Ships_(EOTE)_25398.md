# Star Wars: Of Hutts and Ships (EOTE)

### **Alicia** (2013-11-19 13:19:38)

I've been considering running the Edge of the Empire Beginner's adventures Fantasy Flight released. If I do, I'll be running it on the Virtual TableTop program Roll20.
Here's the link for more information:

If you're serious about it being on 01/05/14, then I'd like to check out the system. It may turn out to be something I could actually convince folks I know to get into RPGs, so that'd be nice. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

Some time or after that day yes. Would you be able to play on Sundays?

### **BWS2K** (2013-11-19 21:22:44)

I think so, yeah. I don't have a camera or much in the way of a mic though. Actually... how long is a session about? I could probably manage an hour or even two, but more than that and my kiddos will start asking when I'm going to play Minecraft with them. It's far enough in the future that I can try and plan for it though, if it won't take too long at a shot. Don't worry about it if you've got other folks more able to commit.

RP will be done through text so you'll be safe with not having either.
Games will probably average 3-4 hours.

### **BWS2K** (2013-11-19 21:51:23)

Eeeew. Well. Maybe I'll just repeal that offer then. If, by some miracle, you end up short or need a stand-in for a session I can make time. I can't commit to that every weekend though, sorry. <!-- s:/ -->![:/](https://i.ibb.co/1fht9Fjq/icon-mad.gif)<!-- s:/ -->

Sounds interesting <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> I am interested in trying this out though I had not heard of EOTE until now.

Sounds interesting but I already have a game that I commit to on Sundays for said amount of time on Roll20.

### **Alicia** (2013-11-21 09:35:22)

The game time will be up in the air really. Being a couple months in the future, I may not even be available.

Will look up the books and get familiar with the system. Been getting decent with SAGA recently. Gotany links to the books?

Nice thing about the module I want to run as an intro is that it introduces the rules in an easy as you go manner.
