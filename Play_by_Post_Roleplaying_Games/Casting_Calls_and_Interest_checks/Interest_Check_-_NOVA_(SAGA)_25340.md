# Interest Check - NOVA (SAGA)

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-18 11:40:42)

I've had an idea bouncing around in my skull for a few years now for a good story/game, at least in my mind. Been fleshing out a lot of ideas but recently started playing SAGA rules and think they would fit nicely.
Now thing is although I would be using SAGA rules, and most of the source books, the game would not be in the SW Universe. That in mind, of course some things would change in description in the rules but essentially work out the same.
Basic back story is a galaxy in a fledgling state, there are several galactic powers vying for control including a criminal element. All out war has not happened but there have been some skirmishes between 3 major powers, with hints of influence from a syndicated criminal power, over some strategic systems.
The group, if there is enough people are interested, I plan on having being hired on by one of these powers, or be apart of, to assist in various missions to further their cause. Things to expect are ground and space combat (capital and starfighters), diplomatic missions, and taking down the corrupting forces of the criminal syndicate.
Each if the 3 major powers are similar in strength, but each has its own philosophy of how the galaxy should be controlled. One is militaristic, another is democratic, the last being like a monarchy. I plan on having the group work for the Democratic power
As for the "force" abilities they would be considered psyonics to most degree. The abilities are relatively new in the gakaxy. Only recently discovered by small groups around the galaxy it's still being explored. Dark Side points will be in effect for all the side affects when using abilities inherently "evil". I'm open to development of said abilities to something similar to the Jedi and Sith.
All that being said would anyone be interested in such a game?
If there is enough interest I'll create a casting call with the Big 16, galactic timeline, and other info.

...could I play a droid? Not totally committed yet, but that's usually my first question. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

Alternate universe with a Cold War element. Very interesting. Nice idea, though I'd have to pass as I don't want to get involved in too much especially since BWS2k and I are considering co-gming a game.

Yes Droid Heros will be available, although I don't want to have too many on the team.
Yeah, that is one way of putting it. Cold War element.

Shhh! It's supposed to be Top Secret, isn't it?! I thought it was, anyway.<span style="font-size: 0.85em;"> Maybe I was wrong&#8230; </span><span style="font-size: 0.50em;">I wanna be a droid&#8230;</span>

I guess best way to put it:
Imagine a SW Universe where none of the historical events ever happened. Everything has taken a totally different path leading up to year of the game. So most SW races would be available for play. Time basis would be approximately beginning of the Old Republic era just different governmental powers at play. The players will get to help forge a "new" SW Universe.
@BWS2K & Alicia if you aren't taxed out with your game I'd love to have you along. And yes I will allow some droid heros. I'm thinking of running with at least 4 players up to 8 but I don't want to have more than 2 droid heros.

Shows you how I am about keeping secrets (even though we never agreed to). <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-18 20:00:55)

So thats two and a possible 3rd. Couple more and I'll create a casting call <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->)

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-19 20:56:35)

I think over the next week I'll finalize the background info on the 4 major powers and historical timeline. Going to grab a galactic map of appropriate era and mark it with current control by faction. That way I have everything ready for creating a casting call in a week or two if there is more interest.

As a teaser I wanted to toss up this image that I borrowed and modified to show the influence of the three primary galactic organizations that formed shortly after the 1st Galactic War.
![SW+NOVA+Influence+Map.jpg](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k6lfFqrLrL0/UUvLcqiWCpI/AAAAAAAAADs/zVCkkWOhjzI/s1062/SW+NOVA+Influence+Map.jpg)
The Syndicate is a fourth entity that doesn't actually control any systems outright but has dug into other systems through corruption, black marketing, and other methods. When it comes time for a game their strength of influence on the map will also be marked to show how corrupted some systems are. The more corrupt, the more likely bribing will be successful or how easy it would be to find illegal items on the market, a twist on that is some corrupted officials might also be working for another entity which could compromise the team.
**The Imperial Regime** is a government growing very similar to the Empire. They are a bit racist, believing Humans are superior, and do believe in slave ownership. Their military strength is high, granting them a much larger swath of the galaxy, but most of it is less than adequately skilled. It is a force of quantity, not quality.
**The Esseles Commonwealth** is a monarchy government with a ruling house that is "elected" into power every decade. There over a hundred noble houses that are eligible, but rule has transferred between the same six noble houses in the last three centuries. Their military strength is low compared to the rest but made of highly skilled pilots and soldiers, and very well equipped.
**The Galactic Republic** is very similar to the Republic as we currently know it, although still in its fledgling stages. It has a moderate military strength overall, that seems to have a balance of skill for their numbers.

I don't think I'll be able to play in this but obviously you've put a lot of work into it and I will definitely keep up with how it goes. It looks really awesome! <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-23 13:48:42)

Its something I've been working on for a few years only now being able to put together in a playable format. Originally was a novel idea that never truly got started. Still have to draw up the char sheets for the prominent NPC characters that will be in the game from time to time.
