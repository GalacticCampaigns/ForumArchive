# [Saga Leg - ORPG] Star Wars - Alderaan's Wake [Slots Open]

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-05-12 19:05:09)

The time is 137.5 ABY. It was just another day in passing of the Second Imperial Civil War. You knew three names that were responsible for this war. Darth Krayt, Emperor Roan Fel, and Cade Skywalker. Roan Fel had recently perished in the Battle of Bastion, or so the official reports had presented. These people were faceless to you, other than what you had seen in HoloNews feeds. What was this war to you? It was hard to say. You knew the Sith Empire represented order. They were in control of your planet that you called home. Occasionally the splinter faction of Fel’s Empire or Cade’s terrorist organization would attack nearby systems, but nothing that truly disturbed you. However, the threat was presented as omniscient and could disrupt the order of your system at any time. Did you care? You found it difficult. You believed in yourself, and self-growth. To what end? Strangely you just felt the urge for more knowledge and strength. In the hyperspace astrogation classes at school you distinguished yourself beyond all others. Physically speaking you could do anything and your fellow scholars feared you. You always felt you were meant for something more, and had unstoppable ambition. You would even be vengeful if a person obstructed your means to that end. But just what were you seeking? You had no guidance.
Around sometime this month, as if destined by the stars themselves, a knock came to the door. Your mother’s protocol droid answered the droid with the standard rhetoric while you were in your room attending to your flimsiplast knowledge. The conversation carried over to your room, as it disturbed the sort of studious trance you were in. At first, you felt a twinge of anger, but then it subsided quickly as you heard the conversation. “It is an honor to have Imperial guests in our home. We have Corellian sweet water available for refreshment…” “We have no time for this droid..where is the teenager?” What was this about? Your mother was now raising a commotion and at which point you heard the voices being exchanged. The voices escalated, and then you heard a voice projecting from a vocabulator unit. What was going on? You dare not leave your room. Were Imperials really in your house?!
Your mom could be heard struggling. It was a violent screaming, then a powerful energy crack that vibrated your door slightly. Your holo book was pushed off your desk as you stood. Strangely, you were not scared, yet you felt slightly excited. This was…suspenseful…something you had rarely experienced. The footsteps could be heard. Instinctively you knew it was five men from your senses.
Your bedroom door opened with a hiss to reveal an officer dressed in a Naval Gray uniform. And then, there was a sight of awe that all creatures knew from across the galaxy. There stood four men standing tall and stoic. Their armor was a pristine white, polished to a mirror sheen. The armor served only two tactical purposes: for ballistic impact protection, and to serve as a uniform symbol of fear and power to all those in the galaxy. Their helmets had ghastly black lenses that served to stare into your very soul. Yet, you still did not bear any fear. Rather, you had trouble suppressing a grin on your face…even despite your mother’s condition. The officer waved his hand and the troops stepped forward with precise movements that only months upon months of drill movement could instill. They moved like battle droids, but had a human fluidity to them. One of them withdrew a small device and held it to your finger. A small mechanical whir could be heard as a small pinch of pain was in your fingertips. The stormtrooper passed the handheld device to the officer. He inspected the device. “Very well, this is our target.”
You? A target? Were you that important? All your life you had just known your ambition. You knew you’d be important. But now? You didn’t really care the reason why they had found you. You just cared that the Imperials had deemed you important. Their creed was, **“Honor and distinction.”**
You muttered the question, **“Am I to join the Empire? Am I to become a Stormtrooper?”** The officer shook his head. He held out a holoprojector unit and kneeled with a grim look on his face. “I’m afraid it won’t be that easy young one.” He flicked on the holoprojection unit. “You will serve this man.”

With that, you were full of questions. How was he even alive?! What were they trying to tell you? The officer saw the shock in your eyes and offered you a bit of comfort. **“You have questions. But come with us…and you shall have your answers; nothing more and nothing less. You will serve the Empire, but answer only to one man.”**
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**GAME MECHANICS:**</span>
Welcome all to the new recruiting phase of my campaign. This campaign has been running over a year with a storyline that all the players have thoroughly enjoyed. As due to the length (and danger) of the campaign, player attrition has been high. That being said, this is a demanding campaign. We play as if we are living in the Star Wars realm itself. This is certainly not for a casual roleplayer. That being said, expect to have some catching up to do in regards to the story. Currently, I need 4 Sith Apprentice characters. As a Sith apprentice, you need to be somewhere in your teenage years (Or younger). (Any Force Sensitives species is fine.) All new players are to take level one. Yes there will be a tremendous level gap, but that's why their is a challenge level encounter system so adventures are well-balanced. Not to mention, you will gain just as much experience as your master's. So you essentially will be "power-leveling."
Your sub-plot will revolve on Master-Apprentice relationship and your training in the ways of the Sith, all the while having to adapt to the Second Imperial War and your master's own adventures. If we recruit four apprentices, expect matters to be competitive or die in your attempt to become an Apprentice as their are only two Sith available to train you. Here is a summary of the essential parts needed for your character sheet.
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">GAME ESSENTIALS:</span>**
All Sith Apprentices must be a level 1 Jedi.
A detailed backstory of your character is required. This is a roleplay intensive campaign. I need to see your abilities to roleplay. You can play the strong-silent warrior, but you will not take as much from the campaign while the other players are talking and you are brooding about your next warpath. Your character must be strong, intelligent, silver-tongued, and charismatic to get the most from the campaign.
If you are a diplomatic or philosophical role player you will certainly find a home here. Tell us about your subconscious calling to the Dark Side, your thoughts on the Second Imperial Civil War, or your grand struggle for personal gain and conquest. Since you likely have a humble childhood, it mostly needs to demonstrate your traits to be a Sith.
For your levels, use the 32 point buy or dice score method (whichever you prefer).
Take max credits or we can roll for them (whichever you prefer).
Our play time's are every Monday at 5 PM cst. We play on ORPG. Server's change and the name of the room is Star Wars - Alderaan's Wake. (Time's can be very flexible to fit your schedule).
No destinies permitted.

I will be happy to give you a more in-depth rundown of the story upon the request. We will need to arrange a chat session to do so.

Hey man. Welcome to the site. Well...unfortunately this game has about 5 sessions until the ending. We are capped out on players. That is unless you want to play an enemy commander or something to go against the players.

Methinks it's a bot. Look at the user's previous posts.
