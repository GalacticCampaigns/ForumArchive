<span style="font-size: 1.00em;">***It is a time of adventure. Heroes and villains alike seek their fortunes across the galaxy. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Mos Eisley spaceport, a wretched hive of scum and villainy situated on the desert planet of Tatooine.
The Hutts command a strong presence in Mos Eisley, but they are not the only criminals. Rival syndicates and cabals prowl the dusty streets, making profits at the expense of one another, as well as society at large. Inevitably these disparate groups collide, their conflicting interests leading to open strife.
As unrest grips Mos Eisley&amp;#39;s underworld, Prello the Hutt contacts a group of mysterious heroes, requesting their aid in locating one of her most valued retainers. Can they find him before his enemies do?***</span>

Character Creation guidelines:

* Level 4
* 32-point build, 28 points for droids
* No tracking ammunition - a roll of **1** on an attack means you're out (certain special exceptions to this will be made at GM's discretion)
* Don't worry about a ship, one will be "provided"
* Starting wealth for class + 1000c
* Each player has an additional 5000c to spend on any item or items of significance to the character. This is *not* extra ammunition or something ordinary and expensive, but *can* be a special sidearm with a name that has a history, a seedy contact, a legacy-type item of some sort, etc. Use these credits to really help with the build, and consider it plus or minus a couple hundred depending on what it is exactly (GM's discretion and all that)
* Backgrounds will be used, not Destinies
* Any special requests should be submitted to GM for consideration
* The game will take place in 5 BBY so choose races accordingly (existent but lesser known ones are probably okay but not impossible ones like Ewoks or Vong)
* **Force Sensitivity** is allowed - just consider the possible ramifications I have as a GM with a FS character in Mos Eisley 5 years before the destruction of the Death Star <!– s:D –>![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!– s:D –>

<div style="text-align: center;">
**Please post 5-7 sentences in this thread describing your build first. We&#39;ll work out details together and then you can run the numbers. The more background/personality/motivation information the better! We have plenty of time to get started, so don&#39;t rush and please consider that you&#39;ll be part of a team.**
</div>

Additions:

* Maximum starting hit points
* The 5000c doesn't need to be equipment - it can be a contact, a droid, etc. Any leftover credits in this category are lost once the game starts. If you all want to pool them that's fine too.
* Instead of choosing a Destiny you will instead choose a **Background**. The Background will work as normal depending on whether *Event*, *Occupation* or *Origin* is chosen. Every odd level you will gain 1 Destiny point instead of 1 every level. Additionally, there are no longer any Destiny bonuses aside from those afforded by talents and other uses of Destiny Points. On occasion, the GM may see fit to award additional DPs for heroic actions or other exceptional actions. If a player selects a **Planet of Origin** background, they receive *two free skill trainings from the list* for any two of the three skills listed. For **Occupation** and **Event** backgrounds, players receive *one free skill training from the skills listed list*, as well as a *second skill added to their class list*. Players still receive all other benefits listed with each individual background.
* Please make sure to provide references for all non-core stuff.

**Background**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Marina had escaped to Telos a few months after Order 66 had been initiated to rendeavous with her master Silas Draay. When he failed to appear she tried to hire herself as a mechanic in the hopes of leaving the planet before she was discovered. Eventually she was able to hijack a ship and make her way back to Iruji, though not before she had learned the truth of the Republic’s fate. Disheartened upon learning that it was Anakin Skywalker, the hero of the Republic, who had betrayed them to the Sith Lord the self proclaimed Emperor. Proceeding into her own exile, she returns back to the place she had once been happy to raise her daughter as she had once promised.
Nadia grew up not only under the guidance of her mother Marina but her foster mother Jaya Cloudspinner, an elder of the communuity (though she’s barely in her thirties when Marina met her) and a powerful Telapath. Jaya’s children became like her own siblings, all of them raised together till maturity. As was tradition within the community, Nadia tried her hand at the apprenticeship of many crafts, but found her skill residing in fixing the few mechanical devices found on the technology backwards agrarian planet.
As an exercise, Nadia began to fix the old ship her mother had long ago used to return to the planet. Left forgotten in storage it became a considerable project, but eventually she got it working enough she could leave the atmosphere of the planet. Urged by the stories her mother would tell her of the once grand Republic, the young, naive Nadia longed to explore and take her place in the galaxy like her mother once had as a member of the Jedi Order. Unable to dissuade her daughter, Marina and Jaya were forced to let the young woman make her own mistakes as she set out on her own into the vast unknown.

Maybe too short, but my concept would be a Human taking mostly levels of Fighter but later with Scout mixed in, working toward the Prestige Class of Gunslinger.
Having grown up near the Mos Eisley spaceport, he's well aware of Hutts and their organizations. As a lower level worker he's managed to work his way up to bodyguard of a local merchant who thought more of his own value than any threats did. But body guard he did, gaining skill and prowess with his weapons.
If that's something you'd like me to build for a final approval, just say the word.
Alternately, it would be a Wookiee with a Bowcaster, also working toward Gunslinger! But Wookiee might be harder to integrate into the starting scenario.

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-09 19:08:11)

**Alicia**: What were you thinking for Force Powers, and what's the approximate value in credits of that lightsaber? I remember it from before but I never bothered with a cost.
**Anodyzed**: Welcome to the site! Both of those sound workable but (and I almost noted this in the CC requirements) while the Human may have worked with Hutts before he *shouldn't* know Prello much at all. Maybe her name but that's about it. The Wookie would be an interesting choice but, given the nature of the scenario, not an impossible one (not much more than a Force Sensitive anyway). They're enslaved by the Empire so I would expect a background that gives a reason for his not being an Imperial slave. It could be that he escaped somehow, in which case he needs to avoid almost any Imperials anywhere for any reason. It could be that he *is* an Imperial slave but belongs to an eccentric officer that sends him to do dirty work and takes all the pay and stuff like that, or maybe he belongs not to an Imperial at all but perhaps another Hutt or some other crimelord. A "*Sorry Darth Vader, I'm already enslaved to someone else*" sort of thing. Go ahead and give me more on whichever you choose, or both if you like - it never hurts to have options.

Somewhere between 3k and 4k. The heirloom and the force switch don't really have a cost and neither really does the crystal.
As for Powers, probably the basics focusing on Telekinetic. So Move Object, Surge, etc.

I added a couple things to the first post in here. **Alicia** and **Anodyzed** - you can post your full character sheets once you get them all set. As usual, I'm trusting you on the numbers because, well, I'm not the least bit interested in double-checking your math. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

Updated, though not quite done yet. I'll probably be adding more to the background depending on how you're going to work us all together.

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-10 16:04:30)

Good catch DA. I suppose I should check the sheets a *little* bit more than reading the Force Powers and Feats... <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
Yeah, I was thinking about the Destiny/Background stuff. I think it might be fun to award DP like XP occasionally, to represent the characters coming into their own. Not bunches and bunches, just like if you roleplay a scene really well or maybe at the end of a big finale. "*Wow DA, that was totally unexpected and amazing and in character - have a Destiny Point!*" Thoughts? Is that something that people have done before? Did it work out?

Harn Carver Contact (5000c):
Edie Rave is a lower level bureaucrat in the Tatooine Government, assigned and living in Mos Eisley in the Planetary Approach Control offices. Her specific responsibilities are Ship's Registry. She processes applications for Registry, ownership transfers, and researches claims relating to ship Registry within the Empire. Uniquely, since her job is so expansive in reach, her access to the Imperial grid is considerable for such a low level bureaucrat.
Edie was one of Harn's first girlfriends. And although their 'love' never blossomed, their friendship did. Even during those times When they were offworld, Harn serving a tour with the Imperial Army, Edie for Imperial indoctrination, they kept in touch, and the contact strengthened their bond. And though they haven't actually laid eyes on each other in close to 3 years, they've never been better friends.
And from time to time, when Harn has needed a bit of research through the Imperial grid, Edie has been able to accomplish it for him with relative ease.

Background: Harn is originally from Tatooine, a planet that teaches the hard lessons of Endurance and Survival.
Edited: Added 4th Level Ability 'bumps' in STR and DEX
Edited: Added "Contact" in Spoiler
Edited: Added Background Planet of Origin and 2 trained Skills

If I said we were going to use this, does anyone understand it? Basically it just makes the Backgrounds a little more useful, and I had already mentioned awarding DP occasionally. You'll end up with 2 DPs to use like normal (but not the other bonus thing that goes with them, the temporary modifiers for doing something related to your Destiny) plus an extra trained skill or two.

### **Anodyzed** (2012-06-10 18:46:48)

the italicized part is your question? sounds to me like IF I chose Origin, then I could pick Tatooine as my planet of origin, even as a fighter, I could then add (two of )Endurance, Ride and Survival to my list of TRAINED skills.
I like it. I've never understood why Soldiers didn't have Endurance and Survival anyway!
In the Occupation or Event options, it looks like I could pick one addtional to be TRAINED in, and add the other to my class list (to pick from INSTEAD of whatever else I'd had available before).
Sounds good to me.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-10 19:04:02)

Have you quoted that from somewhere, or is it something you came up with yourself? Because I won´t lie, of course it sounds good since it offers a lot more to me as a player.
I like the thing about getting DPs even when using Backgrounds, having a few of them is nice when you want to do some epic stuff, though I might have been more restrictive and given them once every five levels, plus for truly heroic actions (which you´ll most likely use a DP to accomplish anyway). However, I think the shift in Background effects is on the side of being OP, and also in violation of the whole idea of the system, which - if I understand it correctly - were to give players a more low-key alternative to the amazing powers available from Destiny. Considering how often I´ve used DPs in play though, if this was implemented I´d see Backgrounds as far more valuable. Added skills as class skills is already very good, getting free training as well is even better.
It also is a little imbalanced in favor of the PoO background, IMO. I generally don´t find the advantages of Event backgrounds to be worth a Skill Training (with a few possible exceptions), and I certainly don´t find the +2 to two untrained skills from the Occupation background to be.
I don´t mean to be overly critic or anything, this is your game and you can run it however you wish. The above are just my thoughts, but they might be worth to note, as each character will be significantly more capable than if the rules were used as written.
@Anodyzed - Soldiers do have Endurance as a class skill. I would agree it would be weird if they didn´t. Survival is probably lacking because it is kind of the Scout´s niche - and let´s face it, quite useless unless your campaign takes place a lot outside, in which case the Scout is already the more desirable alternative because of more trained skills so you can spend a few on physical skills. That´s my thoughts at least.

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-10 22:12:42)

**It's not my own rule at all.** It's actually just a cut and paste synthesis (with some of my own wording added in) of Anazider's rule from Fading Light and Alicia's from Perdition a while back. In the long run, with Destiny Points, I think we'd just never use them all up. I could be wrong but epic things don't happen all the time and with so many between the lot of you, you'd just be able to go crazy. Don't forget you've got FP as well. This way you've got a couple DP, just in case, and to have something a little more immediate, and different, you get these (modified) Background things. The way the Backgrounds are actually written confuse me, to be honest, since in some of them (sometimes the more likely ones to fit your character) you receive next to nothing as a benefit. I don't know why I'd ever bother with some of them, just write whatever for a background and get a free cybernetic eyeball. <!-- s8/ -->![8/](https://i.ibb.co/kVxpy8vX/icon-eek.gif)<!-- s8/ -->
I believe it's worth a shot to try out. The adventure isn't too terribly long anyway, which is nice. Wasn't there someone else who wanted in?

I was just curious as to where you got it from, as I couldn´t remember seeing it in any book. I know you didn´t ask directly for opinions, but I just thought it was kind of important to point out that (at least the way I see it), this would be a major power boost for characters overall. I don´t like to have things too easy <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
I happen to be a big fan of backgrounds as they are written, and I think the ability to add one or two skills to your class skill list is awesome as it helps a lot with building many concepts. The only extra benefit I think is rather weak is the one for the Occupation backgrounds, since they usually offers bonuses to skills you´d be trained in anyway. But we can discuss that in another thread.

Verin spent the first few years of his life on a ship, until it was attacked by a group of pirates and his family's ship crashed on Gamorr, killing his mother in the crash. The ship was damaged beyond repair and the crew had to start worrying about survival on such a violent planet. He grew up learning survival techniques from Clan Bk'trugh that had taken in his family, and the crew from their ship. The Clan became like another family to him. He was taught how to fight and survive by his father, and the Gamorreans, alike. He quickly learned how to wield an axe, though he could never build up the strength to wield the Gamorrean arg'garok, as he helped out with chores and gathering of firewood. When Verin came of age he entered himself in a tournament to first blood that the clan was holding, though he did not win the tournament he had defeated 2 other Gamorrean Boars and had earned his right to the Clan Bk'trugh tattoo that all members had on their arms. As he had gotten older he had realized that his father had been getting progressively ill. No matter what was done to help Verin's Dad it all seemed to be fruitless. Before his Dad finally passed away he gave Verin his prized rifle, that had been handed down from his own father, Bodkinn Kanuzaki. He then told Verin that his grandfather had been a famous mercenary that had been known as Bodkinn Black. He found the story of his grandfather astonishing and a few months after his father passed away he decided that he wanted to head out and see if he could make a name for himself. He waved goodbye to the Gomorreans that he had come to know and love and then he caught a ride with a traveling merchant. He has picked up a few odd jobs tracking down small time criminals, and sometimes the innocent, though for that the money has to be right. The only rule that he has is that he won't accept a contract on a child, which is the same rule that his grandfather had had.

Let me know what you think. I know the background is somewhat basic, but I am still having some troubles thinking straight.

That looks interesting **Duggs**. I've got my wheels going 'round and 'round about how this is all going to proceed for sure, but I don't mind saying that I've had the opening scene in my head for about two weeks or something. Pretty much since the beginning.
**Everyone**: Take you time to clean up your sheets if necessary, double-check the first post for requirements/rules (I just added that Background bit), flesh out some more of your character's story if you like, and we'll try to get started next week. I will likely be able to manage a post every day or two, just so you have an idea of frequency, but they won't always be wicked long - so there will definitely be times to RP a bit. Any last minute requests can be posted here or messaged to me until Sunday night, at which point I hope to have the time to get up the introductory post.<div style="text-align: center;">

Forum request has been submitted. Once it's approved I'll setup the different threads (OOC, Cast, Gaming, etc.). I should be able to have a first post up for you by Monday night.

The Forum is now set up, you can look for it in the games list and place your character sheets in the **Dossier** thread. I have the intro that you've already read up in Part One's thread for now, I'll get a better post up for you as soon as I get the chance. Most likely tonight (in about 14hrs or so). The game hasn't officially started yet so any last-minute requests, changes, additions, etc. are still welcome and once your characters are in the dossier and I have a good chance to look at them all side-by-side I'll let you know if there's anything that may need to be tweaked (I don't expect this but it would be extremely minor things like formatting or something). A hearty *Game on!* and *Welcome once more!* to Anodyzed for your first game on the site!
May The Force be with you all! <!-- s:jedi: -->:<!-- s:jedi: -->

It's hard to hear through the Internet, but that last comment was followed by copious amounts of Scum-and-Villain-ish GM cackling... ![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)
