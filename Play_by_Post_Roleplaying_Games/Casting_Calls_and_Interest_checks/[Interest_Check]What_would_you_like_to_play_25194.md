# [Interest Check]What would you like to play?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-22 08:28:38)

So, I´ve noticed that two of our games have been unfortunately put on hold recently. While I certainly hope the GMs will be able to find their way back to running those games for all of us who like them, I feel that this could be a good time to float some ideas I´ve had for campaigns by you guys, and see if anyone is interested. Basically I´ve got a lot of ideas floating around, so I´d like to start by looking at what kind of campaign people would be interested in.
**Themed Campaigns**
This would be a campaign that has a certain theme to it, which can give a hint of what players may experience, and what kind of characters are most supported. This can also allow for using certain specialized systems, such as Starship Maneuvers (SotG), Rank and Requisition Systems (GaW), Job Generator (S&V), and others. This will also give players a hint of what they are getting, and at the same time it is interesting when a party finds themselves in an unfamiliar situation.
Some ideas for different themes I have includes:

* Military/Paramilitary - I still have my campaign notes for a military game set in the Stormtrooper corps, but could see any kind of structured military being used, and could also see the players being part of (or even leading) a small group of mercenaries or a very militant resistance group.
* Criminal - Players could be running a smuggling ship, or be working for (or here too, possibly leading) a criminal syndicate as a professional squad of specialist agents. Piracy is also an interesting option.
* Law Enforcement - Kind of the opposite of Criminal, and a "step back" from Military. While many law enforcement agencies can be quite militant, they also operate with infiltration, surveillence, negotiation and interrogation. Many organizations would be available such as CorSec, SIS, Imperial Intelligence and many others.
* Jedi/Sith - A campaign could have a focus on Jedi/Sith characters, the mysteries of the Force, and their ability to influence the Galaxy at large.
* Exploration - A campaign that would focus on the exploration of unknown space, and new places.

**Non-Themed Campaigns**
This would be your "traditional" campaign style, where everything could happen, and all characters generally have an equal chance to shine. Think of the movies, KOTOR I & II, and generally a lot of the best RPGs out there. Not much to say about this, other than that I do have campaign notes for a very KOTOR-like campaign, set in the Old Republic that I would be happy to run with you.
**Non-SW Campaigns**
If people want to, I´d be willing to try running another system than SAGA, though in that case I´m thinking that perhaps it would be nice if someone knew of some good premade adventure. I´m willing to try a lot of things, but I´d prefer to run in a system I´m somewhat familiar with. Here are some examples of what I could think about running, most of which have been up on the site before.

* D&D - Explanation unnecessary, though I personally feel more about the 3rd edition than the 4th.
* Call of Chtullu - Horror game, and my second most played game after SAGA. Very easy to get into as it´s percentile-based.
* Eclipse Phase - Interesting game that was brought to my attention by Rowen actually, kind of SciFi-Horror. Also percentile-base and easy to get into, and I can provide anyone interested with a fully legal torrent to get the core rulebook.
* M&M - Read up quite a lot on it when we had some games running here, and it is a very fun and open system.
* Warhammer Fantasy/40K - I found these to be surprisingly interesting systems, but my preference would be Fantasy, since I haven´t quite gotten into the full lore of 40K.

These are some of my thoughts and suggestions on campaigns, and I was hoping to see what people were interested in, and then we could take the discussion further. Or, if people aren´t really interested in another game at all, we could just drop it here.

For me either something with starships which I can upgrade and actually fly/fight in or a sith campaign in the OR era, can't be faffed with anything Jedi post Ep6 (imho the force died with the Sith'ari).
I've got a fair few other sourcebooks, mainly oDnD, Serenity (for some reason) and two of the 40k CRBs (Dark Heresy and whatever the other one is which focuses on space marines), along with d20 Modern / Past / Future / Mecha...etc Hmmm maybe a mecha game, I'd be up for that. Speaking of which I've also got the CRB for Battletech.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-22 10:26:51)

Something with starships...I could see something like a smuggling/piracy game work with that. You´d also have more freedom to modify/upgrade your ships in those situations than in say a fighter squadron game.
I can´t really get your aversion to anything Jedi post-movies (Luke does grow to become awesome, and you have Kyle Katarn kicking all kinds of a** <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->), but if I were to run a Sith campaign I´d chose the OR as well. The rule of two may have its uses, but it does put some restrictions on Sith players when imposed...could make players inquisitors though...hmm...
I did like the 40K system, and my main trouble with such a campaign is that I´d have to read up on some lore to make a sensible campaign, but that´s the only thing.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-02-22 11:03:36)

re: Starships: Yeah that'd be good. Or to be honest, I'd happily play in a squadron just so I get to experience space combat once in my SW career, even if it does end up in a firy mess. In that vain though, I'd quite like to roll for mechanics checks for repairs...etc and salvaging spare parts from dealers...etc too.
re: Post-Movies: Luke.....meh...Kyle Katarn ok, this I can understand. But Luke just isn't awesome enough. In a Rule of Two setting players could be the inquisitors for NPC masters. Maybe help the apprentice in their bid for power against their master? If you've read Knight Errant, that was an interesting setting. Sith warring against Sith and other Darkside users (not necessarily Sith).
re: 40k: My only realy knowledge of the vast 40k lore is of the Ultramarines and their fight against the tyranids. mmm SpaceHulk <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **BWS2K** (2012-02-29 18:17:46)

I suppose I'll chime in here since it was something already on my mind:
I think my ideal game would be some sort of light Survival Horror one. I liked the Resident Evil games I played back in high school (and RE:4 which I played a few years ago) a *lot* for the **limited ammo**, **hordes of bad guys around every corner**, and **three-hits-and-you're-dead-so-stock-up-on-health-potions-or-else** motivation. I also liked the crafting stuff (mixing ammo types, modular weapons, etc.). These elements are present in other games too, like Fallout 3 or System Shock 2. I don't know a good system for it and all I have/know is Saga, GURPS, and Eclipse Phase (which I've read through a number of times but still don't quite understand). I toyed with a couple ideas other than *Reality Bytes* and I've been sort of re-visiting them this week as I clean up my hard drive. One of them was your basic: "You wake up in a hospital room/medbay/medieval church with no memory of who you are. The town is crawling with zombies/mutant spiders/etc." Basically you'd have a set amount of points to build your character, but the GM would also build components that the player would have revealed to them as they progress. "You see a revolver and, picking it up, intuitively spin it like a cowboy." - that would be followed by an OOC comment by the GM that your pistol skill is above average and you could add that to your sheet. Along with the limited ammunition, it would be nice to play a game where the rules for things like survival (hunting, tracking, disease, etc.), travel, and eating/drinking water/sleeping were emphasized. My *Survivor:Earth* setting (mostly still in my brain but laid out in a couple different places I think) capitalizes on these themes. And I like Mechs too. lol
That's my ideal game. Whether it was a solo, duo, or small party would obviously affect a lot of things so maybe it would be a couple solo threads that start out in different locations in the city/village/ship and then they can meet up to beat baddies and solve the mystery/save the day. Each player would be separated from the others by an obstacle or two. Of your suggestions, I think Eclipse Phase is the closest to hitting all these things. Just my two-and-a-half cents. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

So working with jaybee's idea about a starship - maybe the first chapter is the players re-taking their own ship back from the alienszombiemechs and then discovering that there was an alienzombiemech disease that spread throughout most of the galaxy and they have to go from planet to planet killing and curing and rescuing. My character, Servo, was intended to roam Raxus Prime scavenging junk and making it into useful things while avoiding and defeating baddies (at a very basic level)... but he failed quite miserably at that. lol

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-29 19:37:57)

I see what you are saying, and survival horror is kind of fun. I always try to emphasize things like ammo count and other things in my games, and when people don´t pay attention to them, they tend to regret it. I can´t tell you how loud I cursed when I ran out of ammo during the final battle in *Mass Effect 2*, and how loud I screamed in joy when I found a clip dropped by an opponent <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
I too would think that EP is quite suited to run this type of game, as it´s got the horror parts already built into the system, plus I´ve been really wanting to try it out. I´m a little more partial to an approach similar to the Mass Effect games when it comes to horror scenarios though: You don´t necessarily have to be an amnesiac loner waking up somewhere, but instead you could be part of a military strike unit (or a science team, or whatever), that is sent to investigate something, and then once you get there, things just go really really bad...
At least it´s nice to see some more interest on this, I had hoped more people would be contributing...

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-02-29 19:44:29)

I've never played Mass Effect but I hear what you're saying. I think of a situation like in the *Alien* movies: ordinary people (or soldiers) suddenly up against crazy bad monsters with little more than their wits and a limited supply of flamethrowers. Those were some especially excellent baddies too. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-29 20:00:21)

Yeah no it wasn´t introduced in Mass Effect, but they do stuff like that on occasion: Send you off to investigate some distress call or something, and then things just go south once you get there. Alien would seem like a good example too.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-02-29 21:22:57)

I just finished the Quickstart rules (for EP) and I'm cool with that. I'll probably have to play a default character for a bit but then, after that character dies a gruesome and inevitable death in Chapter One, maybe I'll tackle building my own. **lol** If you're just wanting to test out the system I don't mind running a short solo scenario without a future commitment too. I like the idea of traveling/smuggling on our own ship - maybe using the job generator from S&V or something. Since we're being honest here, I'd really like to start at CL1 or CL2 and build up from there too. There's several ways to nab XP that don't involve risking blaster fire. It's not necessary but I'd like to give it a try.
I seem to recall perusing the D20 core book at some point in the past but I don't own it. If there's a "lite" version or something I'll try to find it. It's similar enough to Saga that it wouldn't take to much to handle.

I'd like to do this too, but the problem I think is, that over pbp...games take sometimes months to play out, so to get that second level may take a ridiculous amount of time. So getting to a level where your character is semi-powerful and has access to a decent number of feats/talents...may take years.

I can't remember having a problem with the ME2 boss, which reminds me...I should go back and play through that a few more times now that the expansions are released for that Blue girl. (I may have originally completed it by 2 days after release <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> )

I'm fine with ammo and health management if the system is flexible enough to allow it. I mean in RE you culd stock up on bandages...etc for the time you got absolutely fubar'd by a monster and just pop the lot of them.

I really want to craft something. Like a spaceship, but roll or whatever for the seperate elements so I could turn out with an absolute wreck that takes 20minutes to start up, but has exceptional weaponry on it...but with a targetting system from the middle ages.....but it would be MY WRECK GODDAMIT! Having these little quirks in anything built, that double edged sword if you're a sh*te mechanic...this I like. Having a Mininuke launcher that the ammo could fall out of by mistake and kill the whole party....that's a risk I like to see.

I know what you mean about the lower CLs and you're right - it's just dreamin' mostly. In Saga you can craft things with a good Perception/Mechanic skill combo and the Scavenger Feat and since even DA wanted that for Surge maybe that's something we can try to include no matter what...? Not sure how it would work in other systems. In GURPS I would literally spend *hours* in the Space book making ships and systems using my graphing calculator - they account for *everything* conceivable. The star system generator was really nice too, just using graph paper and random rolls but you end up knowing things like how long a day lasts, what sort of atmosphere there is, what's the gravity, average temperature... it's crazy. And I was just doing it for fun!

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-01 11:25:09)

It sounds like I need to get my hands on GURPS, that sounds great fun!

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-01 11:40:39)

I'm familiar with the 3rd edition, and the Lite version is available for free from Steve Jackson Games. We can talk about this more after lunch. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
<details><summary>&quot;Edit&quot;</summary>

**Edit:** If you check my blog you can see the links to **3e Lite** and an adventure that's more medieval-ish in nature. The two or three times I played it was my first ever experience with tabletop RPG and it was with some friends and family - very informal and I'm pretty sure we weren't following all the rules correctly. I like that you can aim at specific body areas (not in the basic combat in the Lite version but it's easily ported) like headshots (zombies!), hands (to knock out weapons), legs (to cripple and slow) and yes, even the groin. It's way more crunchy than Saga, meaning there's for more numbers and calculations to do for players and GMs who really want to play RAW. In **Saga** you just say "I want to fix that hyperdrive." and roll Mechanics. In **GURPS** it might involve more rolling or one roll with modifiers or something, but maybe I'd need to see it played out to better understand. I read the **Eclipse Phase Quickstart** last night and then some of the actual core book and there's some strong points there as well: the way Actions are carried out seems neat (maybe more than one in a turn), and the environment is definitely creepier. I tend to think the idea of playing a character that's just sort of a scum/junker/scavenger without any real ties to major political workings would be best. Firewall needs fringers too. There was a mini-adventure in a Saga book somewhere about some sort of shadow creature that I remember thinking was cool but overall Saga/SW is not so much about horror and suspense. Of course GURPS also includes **magic** and **psi** powers and that, coupled with something like a medieval setting, could really be interesting. In my opinion they should be used lightly though, since I can't really imagine what some of those spells/powers would really do for a game other than cause headaches. GURPS is really just what you make of it. It has rules for fatigue, dehydration, starvation, and disease that seem really neat, and I have the **Reign of Steel** book (but not the Robots one, sadly) in which there's a really great Terminator-esque setting that has some great scavenging suggestions/tables. I never read **D20** Post-Apocalypse (or whatever it's called) but if those books weren't so expensive I'd probably have ended up with them instead of Saga just because of that book's reviews. I don't really want to learn a new system but I don't mind trying out Eclipse Phase, or using the Saga system for something not SW (or is SW but not directly involving the main stuff - maybe focusing on exploration or the Outbound Flight Project or Katana Fleet or some such thing). GURPS is alright and if we need to acclimate to it I don't mind running a *very* short adventure (measured in 2-3 *weeks* of real-time) to get everyone on the same page. That will probably end up being medieval zombies because that sounds cool. I like the **Mythic GM Emulator** but I'm finding that it works best for solo creative writing perhaps than a full-on GM tool.

</details>

So to conclude: I'll stop spamming the thread and just say "*Yes, I'd be up for something different.*" <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-02 04:24:29)

It wasn´t so much that I had trouble with the ME2 boss, but I must have been doing some terrible shooting, because about 60% through his health, all my weapons start to click empty...not what you want to happen at that moment...
I´ve read a bit about GURPS, and though it seems quite good, it was a bit too...heavy for me, and I´d prefer something a little bit lighter. I don´t really mind having detailed and quite complete rules, but as I recall that system took things too far. If I ever get my fantasy conversion of the SAGA rules done, I promise I´ll run a campaign with that, but that´s still quite a far bit away.
Starting off at 1st level has its advantages, but so far I´ve noticed that people tend to have a tendency to drop off through a PbP game. Also, personally I think it´s more fun when you´ve had a chnance to flesh out your character and concept a bit more, and that tends to take a few levels, depending on concept. Plus, even though there are many challenges that are not combat in nature, unless you spend all your resources on Skill Focus and stuff like that, you will be quite limited in what you can actually do.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-02 09:27:30)

I agree. And... a fantasy conversion for Saga?! That would be awesome! I keep trying to think about how to use it in a modern or post-apocalyptic setting too.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-02 11:52:24)

It´s something I´ve been working with on and off during a few years, having periodic bursts of activity. Basically the troubles I´m having is translating the things from SAGA that needs changing in order to fit a more classic fantasy setting. These are things like magic (force =/= magic in my book), wearing armor and fighting in melee being the norm, and a lot of other things.
I think it would be much easier to convert to a modern-ish setting, since so many elements still remain the same.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-04 21:13:42)

As my final answer to this thread DA - I'm willing to try Eclipse Phase and I'm about to open an Interest Check for a GURPS 3e scenario (*very* short introduction to the system). I'm going to back out of Saga for now. If we end up doing EP though, I'm totally naming my character Jorax Okin. Or Andy. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Saw some interest in this thread for a horror/survival game. Have you guys ever considered New World of Darkness or any of its expansions so to speak (Vampire:the Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken and Mage: The Awakening)? From what I remember the rules are fairly easy and it all focuses on story telling, perfect for a pbp game. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Haven´t really considered those systems...it´s nothing I have experience with, and nothing I have the books for, but how would you say they promote storytelling?

> Haven´t really considered those systems&#8230;it´s nothing I have experience with, and nothing I have the books for, but how would you say they promote storytelling?

White Wolf Publishing started with WoD (World of Darkness) and there system is known as the 'Storytelling System'. While there are rules and dice rolls they are a touch more simplictic in there exectution than say Saga or D&D. The only dice used (If Im remembering correctly) are d10's. Simple checks are made for things like bluffing, pulling open a stuck door, even car chases to facilitate a more story driven game and letting rules (that are present) seem unobtrusive.
Here is a wiki Link that better describes the Storytelling System: <!-- m -->[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling_System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling_System "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling_System")<!-- m -->

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-06 05:51:34)

Sounds like oDnD with regards to the rolls. And I've seen WoD quite a lot on other fora, so I'd be interested to try out any similar system. But does it focus more on the Twilight sort of elements rather than Zombies which I think BW was at least after?
To be honest a hack and slash Blade (as in the film series) survival type of game, might be interesting.

---

### **Rowen** (2012-03-06 06:23:22)

Depends on what you want out of the game really. I've not played the game personally, I have the books though and read most of the rules (preping to run a game of it here once apon a time). From what I do remember it can get quiet intense if done right. Most people reccomend starting players off as mortals and then getting turned into what ever (Vampire, Werewolf), or just staying mortal and trying to duke it out with the supernatural.
Sounded like a lot of fun actually.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-06 07:07:49)

Intense, I like the sound of that! Mortals vs Supernaturals sounds like fun!

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-06 09:15:05)

That looks interesting, Rowen, but to be honest: I'm not sure how much different it is from other systems. I don't have a great deal of experience with many, so that could be why. I have a 20-gallon tub of LEGOs from when I was growing up and I distinctly remember when my brother and I would be shopping we would look at the picture on the box and say, "We have all those pieces... except *that* one." We'd buy the set not for the *set* but really only for those one or two special custom pieces because we knew we could easily make the rest with all the pieces we already had. That's what it feels like with RPG systems to me: Saga uses Star Wars which has an insane amount of lore to draw on (which helps with narration/creation/concepts I think), GURPS has wicked details for every conceivable action/event (hit locations and lots of rules about how to do just about anything including dying), Eclipse Phase has effective immortality coupled with identity switching (which is really handy for someone like me who likes to make characters almost more than playing the game), and the Storytelling System says it focuses more on narration but really all that translates to is less statistics to keep track of since we can type nice long posts full of description and flesh out character backgrounds as much as we like. The concepts of dots is neat but really no different than XP or points or anything else - it just takes up less room on a character sheet. The GURPS system also makes point-based equivalents in character creation so that you can have a Heroscape situation (robots vs. dragons vs. WWII soldiers) without too much trouble and only uses d6's, Eclipse Phase and Storytelling only use d10's, etc. At the end of the day the question seems to be "What system is easiest to have an adventure doing ___?" rather than "What system do you want to play?" Since some are more inexpensive to obtain, that plays a key role in things (at least for me - I'm still unemployed and selling my Saga books here shortly, but I've got GURPS and EP files from a while back).
But my novice-ness is probably showing here. <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: -->
When I mentioned the survival/horror angle I was thinking more about making a character(s) with limited resources and throwing them into a near-hopeless circumstance surrounded by hordes of disposable enemies. Resident Evil and Alien are obvious references. I'm still reading through the Eclipse Phase book in the evenings but I can imagine a group of players in that setting traveling to Earth for a scavenging run and losing communication being attacked by nanoswarms and Exsurgent virii and then... they die. But perhaps they're able to do something that carries over to the next adventure - secure a landing zone maybe, or activating a power source. Next attempt is the same characters (backups of their own cortical stacks) who have to land and try and create a defensive perimeter. It would be neat because we could actually have the dead characters leaving messages for their future selves about dangers in the area or betrayal by their employers or whatever. There's tons of room for character/plot development in between blasting away at throngs of baddies. I don't know, that's just off the top of my head and seems pretty straight-forward and typical (even encouraged) in that system/setting. With just a few players I don't think that's beyond the scope of a pbp.
**Edit**: Regarding that setting specifically (vampires/werewolves/etc.) - I tend to shy away from things that involve features that don't have a good grounding in reality. I suppose that sounds silly, but using Force powers, magic, and the like feel weird to me for a character because I don't have a visual reference for what I'm doing when I cast a fireball or shoot lightning at someone. I remember seeing the video of what it looked like to cast a fireball and having it light up the canyon and that was really neat, but I remember thinking "Can you do this *wrong?*" It's a personal thing I know and maybe it would be different if the whole setting/system revolved around it. I like playing droids/cyborgs because I can imagine what a machine that looks like a person (or not) resembles pretty easy - I'm a child of the eighties and Transformers is imprinted on my brain at a fundamental level. I think this means I'm "hard science" but I'd just as easily throw a flux capacitor or nano-replicator in the mix so I'm not sure. I guess I feel like playing a vampire is just too much for me. I know how people think, and I kind of know how computers work, but I have no reference for craving blood or fearing sunlight and I don't think I'm there yet as a player. Something like Highlander would be neat though; Blade could be interesting since that involves present-day tech and vampires/baddies alongside future tech and humans. Matrix would be crazy and I'm pretty sure there's a site dedicated to GURPS: Matrix somewhere. In a setting crawling with vampires or werewolves human sidekicks might be as much a benefit as anything, and the motivation to not end up as food is pretty strong.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-06 09:55:32)

Now that I see that the Storytelling system seems to have evolved from *Shadowrun* and was the basis for *Exalted*, I think I have a better understanding. It seems interesting, and I liked the system in SR, though there as something when reading through the Exalted rules that made them very hard to understand for me, don´t really know why. And also with all the crappy, teenage-girl fan focused vampire/werewolf crap that have come out in the recent time, I´ve got kind of an aversion to such things (did like the Blade movies though). I guess I just kind of prefer a setting where such creatures exists, but are not the exclusive focus, like pretty much any fantasy setting.
I´m leaning more towards giving Eclipse Phase a shot, probably shoot off with a pre-generated adventure, and then move into something more of my own making if people are interested. I see lots of potential in the system, and it is easy to use. It also shares many similarities with Call of Chtullu, which is my second most played system after SAGA, so I would feel quite comfortable running it (hopefully). I get the feeling that it would work quite well as a PbP game, and that it encourages great stories, with many open-ended rules subject to GM interpretation. And of course a big plus is that I can easily make sure that everyone has access to the rulebook, since the pdf is still fully legal to distribute, from what I can find.
You did bring the system to my attention once Rowen, so maybe you´d like to join, in case you have some time over for gaming. Otherwise I really wish I´d gotten more input on this, but several "regulars" on the site seems to have become more withdrawn lately...and I just hate to put up a casting call and then you get like 1-2 answers.

I see your Themed Campaign and I raise you a Themed-Linked campaign. Consider one or more games running in each of the above mentioned themes in the **same higher level game.** I understand that that was the intent behind Kalium but perhaps a smaller scale deployment of that idea is called for. Perhaps in partnership with another community like this one?

What about SW Themed games using a system other than a SW branded build?

I´m not really looking to start something big, just to get some activity back to the site and thought it would be a good time to do so when two games was put on hold recently. And given that we have an all time low on activity here, I have a hard time seeing that being even possible.
Another system but still SW could work, but I was thinking people might want to try something different as well.

I would have to get EP again, my file that I initially DLed is gone. O.o
Also DA, you mention fantasy. Which system? I tried the D&D 4e and that fell apart, you thinking something like Pathfinder?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-06 16:35:34)

I didn´t post any link, but if the decision was that I should try running an EP game, then I´d hand it out. Still, there´s no reason I can´t do it anyway. It seems the torrent I originally used isn´t well seeded anymore, so here´s a direct link I found.
[***Eclipse Phase Sourcebook***](http://www.mediafire.com/?5y21jnmwmqt "http://www.mediafire.com/?5y21jnmwmqt")
When I mentioned fantasy, it was more in terms of my preferred setting. If we´re talking systems, D&D is a given candidate, though I lean very much in favor of 3.5 rather than 4, which would then include Pathfinder I guess. Adventuring in the Forgotten Realms is really great =) Also found Warhammer Fantasy RPG to be an interesting system, and you made me look into Exalted once before, and even though the system rubbed me sideways for some reason, the setting is great. I also remember reading of a Warfcarft themed d20 RPG, based on the pre-WoW Warcraft I think.

### **Rowen** (2012-03-06 17:17:58)

I don't have much experience with 3.5, while I had the books I never got to play in any games or DM, that was the reason I created this site to begin with. I've heard the Warhammer RPG is rather good actually and I own the books for the Warcraft RPG, the one I have uses 3.5 rules and is esentially WoW in table top form.....there might be a little more flair thrown in.
I'm DLing EP as I right this. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

**Yes**. That's the game I've been trying to think of. Yes - it could play *very* much like Dead Space. I only played a few minutes of that on my brother's XBox but I remember liking the atmosphere instantly. I'm going through the build process right now and I'm amazed at how easy it actually is (not what I thought based on the number of pages in the book). There's just tons of fun little tweaks and stuff.

Each theme could be run by a different gm coordinated through a gm of the gms. I understand that activity may be too low to support that but that could be something to gain interest and recruitment as a longer term project and perhaps a way of play-testing Killiam ideas.

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-06 21:21:16)

I can't say I totally understand having multiple games like that, but the only GMing experience I've officially had was running 5 (with some attrition) solo threads that ended up together. It was wicked fun for me to try and steer characters together and maintain a theme. I didn't get punched in the face and that's usually a good indication of at least a partial success. I can see that being incredibly interesting for an EP adventure - especially since we can use private messaging and things like that. I started reading this a few hours ago:[http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?580741-Eclipse-Phase-The-Alpha-Team](http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?580741-Eclipse-Phase-The-Alpha-Team "http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?580741-Eclipse-Phase-The-Alpha-Team")

What is necessary to gain interest and make new people stick around on this site is some activity. It need to be possible for people to get into games rather quickly or they won´t hang around. Which means we need to have some activity, and get more games going, and preferably not have games as "closed sets" as they are now, with people barely looking at things outside the game they currently play in. I am running a mini version of what you are suggesting at the moment, and it´s working fine.

No, I don´t recall that guy, not sure if I should. People may like what they want, but if I want to play Star Wars, I want to play Star Wars. That may look nice and all, but it isn´t Star Wars.

So I guess what system am I making my characters with?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-07 13:11:18)

Well, since people seems to be reacting positively to it, I think I´ll go ahead and try and run an Eclipse Phase game. I´ll start off with a premade adventure I found, and if that goes well I´ll probably build on it from there.
SO if you haven´t already, you can start familiarizing yourself with the character creation process, and I´ll try to have a proper casting call thread up shortly.

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-08 11:26:48)

What's really cool is I've always had this idea for a game called *Survivor Earth* that involves using Fame and low- and high-tech together and I think this system would be ideal for that. It could be inside a designated habitat rather than on actual Earth if needed.
At first I was making a character based on Sherlock Holmes just to see how the build process works but I think my final character build will focus on the lifelogging events - sure I can have a gunfight but is that what my viewers want? Maybe they want to see me freerun into a jump-kick - it'd be more exciting. And I really really really like that you can have Art as a field. There's a lot of page-turning during character creation for sure but it's usually - as you say - there's a ton of neat little things that really add flavor. And their index in the back blows Saga out of the water.
