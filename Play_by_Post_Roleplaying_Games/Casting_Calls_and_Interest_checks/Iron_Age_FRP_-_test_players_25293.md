# Iron Age FRP - test players

### **IronAgeFRP** (2012-11-22 08:42:25)

Hello everyone, my name is Steven and this is our first campaign. We’ve been working on Iron Age FRP for the last two years and now it’s time to finish the project. For that we need your help. I know that a lot of you reading this will try to download Iron Age: Core rules book over torrent sites, or similar services. Which is fine, people should be able to enjoy different products even if they cannot afford them (it is also promotion of sorts) . Yet, if we do not receive enough contributions, game won’t be available for download ever, as it won’t get published. That would be a shame. So if you like concept and would like it to get published (and (probably) soon end up on torrent download sites) please contribute. Even if you cannot contribute you can share it with other people over social networks, with your mail contacts, friends, etc. that might be interested and able to contribute. Every dollar counts. Click on the link bellow and visit our project site, where you can download free e-book, watch promo movie, share, like, follow our project and help us to make it happen.

Looks nice man - I'd take a shot or two at that thing with three arms in the trailer, but I've already got enough on my plate for now. Best of luck to you though!
