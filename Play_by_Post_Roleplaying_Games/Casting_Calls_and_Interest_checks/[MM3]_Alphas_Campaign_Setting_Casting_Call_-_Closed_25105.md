I hope you meant **Nov** 4th.
I've seen this show on SyFy a couple times. Could be an interesting game, so I'm curious to see what you can do with it.

For those who want to learn, I would say there is a large enough community here to teach you how to play.
If you are familiar with the setting (follow the links in the ad if you aren't) and you have gaming experience, MM3 won't be very hard to learn.
Add everything to a D20, no hit points (abstract measurement of health in this game), and you build the character as you see fit (as opposed to the D&D4e with all of the abilities hardwired into the class).
I would recommend, for those who show serious interest, downloading the free version (b/c not everyone has $30 lying around) of **HERO LAB**.
It's a great MM3 resource, among other games it has to offer.

You probably should have mentioned you had reset this as a casting call... Some people may not look at the first post after having made an initial post.
Anyways. This may be a busy week for me, so not sure how much time I'll be able to dedicate to figuring out a new system. As I probably won't make your Nov 11 deadline, I will back out.

**Samuel Grimm** - PL 10
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Samuel Grimm was born in Blanco, Texas. His father taught him to shoot from a young age and soon started on the amutuer shooting circuit. His hand eye coordination was preternatural. He did a short stint in the Army and was stationed in Afghanistan. He was seriously wounded and discharged for medical reasons. He tried branching out into trick shooting and acting but his acting career was short lived and B rated. His most recent appearance was on Top Shot for the history channel. He won the hundred thousand dollar prize and used it to buy a small garage with an apartment above it. It was his appearance that brought him to the attention of the DCIS and Dr. Rosen.

Oh yeah, had forgotten about this...I had been planning to see what types of characters others posted. Now, DT posted a character quite similar to the one I had in mind...still, I think I´ll post it anyway. Might be fun to have to adrenaline junkies...at least for us <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-11-13 22:01:35)

Well, guess there´s no need for me to finalize the character then... <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->
Anyway, as a hint for the future Snow, when you want to announce something new in a thread like this: **Make a new post**
Edits don´t show up as something new on the forum page, and I would wager that it took several people (me included) some time to see that the casting call was active. And, if I hadn´t made this post, would likely take them yet another while to notice it as being closed.

Ha. You pretty much reiterated what I said above.
