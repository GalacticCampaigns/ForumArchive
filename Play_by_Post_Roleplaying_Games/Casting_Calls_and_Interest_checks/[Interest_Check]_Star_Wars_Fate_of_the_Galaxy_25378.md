# [Interest Check] Star Wars: Fate of the Galaxy

### **Sketchpad** (2013-07-04 23:02:56)

Hi Gang!
I finally have some free time and am looking to run a Star Wars campaign here on GC!
• The game will use [**Fate Core**](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/ "http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/") as the rule set for the campaign. The game is free to download (though they don't mind some money tossed at them either).
• The game takes place in the time period between Episodes III (Revenge of the Sith) and IV (A New Hope).
• Because the system is fairly loose, it will entail a bunch of RPGing, as well as some links between characters. This may require a single chat session withe the group, or an exchange of PMs to set up things.
• I'm looking for the following roles to be filled: Starship Pilot/Captain, Co-Pilot, Engineer, Hired Gun, Rebellion Sympathizer. I may allow a solitary Jedi **IF** the concept wows me.
• No more than 7 people will be recruited once a Casting Call is initiated.
• The campaign is going to be set up like a mini-series (or Adventure Path). There will be Six "Issues" to the campaign. If it works out well, I'll be running more. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
In the past, I've toyed with Starblazer Adventures, but the newest version of the Fate rules I think will work great for the Star Wars feel. At the moment this is just an interest check. I'm not looking for characters yet. Please feel free to post any questions here, I'll try my best to answer them. Thanks, and looking forward to hearing from folks. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Had to look for the free download. It's here for anyone looking for it: <!-- m -->[http://www.evilhat.com/store/index.php? &#8230; cts_id=223](http://www.evilhat.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=79&products_id=223 "http://www.evilhat.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=79&products_id=223")<!-- m -->

Here's sample stats for a starfighter:
**Incom T-65 X-Wing Fighter**
**Scale:** 3...**Move:** 3 Areas/Round
**Aspects:** Lock S-Foils in Attack Position, Stay on Target, Accelerate to Attack Speed, Astromech Link
**Stunts**
**• Linked Laser Cannons:** Considered a Weapon: 2 at the starfighter’s scale.
**• Proton Torpedo Launcher:** Considered a Weapon: 3 at the starfighter’s scale. Has a single shot.
**• Deflector Shields:** Provides Armor: 1 in combat.
**• Hyperdrive:** Gives a +1 to Lore when plotting Hyperspace coordinates.
**Hull Stress OOO**

I'd like to take a crack at the Engineer concept, if that is okay. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Sounds good, gang. I'll be posting a Casting Call as soon as I get a few more folks interested. Hey Dale, welcome to GC, Bub! <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Hmm. Doesn't look like I've got the interest I was hoping for. Guess I'll rework it and maybe run it in Edge of the Empire. Keep your eyes peeled for more info. Alicia, could you close this thread?
