Hello everyone. GM Dreamwalker is back!
I was thinking of making a new Star Wars campaign in OpenRPG form. I want to shoot for one 3 hour session a week. Probably want to have like 6 PC's max, maybe more. There will only be one returning PC from the events of the ItS campaign. That person knows who they are.
Everyone else will make new characters in the Imperial Navy. So, this will be a full-fledged military campaign. Basic adherence to military discipline is a necessity. There will be less combat and more emphasis on speech and decision making that affects a massive amount of characters. Returning players will keep their existing levels but have to make a new character. PC's will be junior officers and usually in charge of a set number of NPC's. The time line is some time after the events in ItS...so around 25 ABY. Just want to get a feel on who wants to play and about what time would be good during the week to play.
(Credit goes to myles1076 for coming up with the title of the campaign).

I can jump in and will work up something for you. Still think PBP would be the better.
