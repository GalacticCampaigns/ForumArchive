# KOTOR-Style Campaign

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-01-31 15:35:43)

Okay, so having hit a roadblock in my current campaign (which is still open casting if anyone wishes to join, I´ll hopefully resume it if I get a couple more players) I´ve decided to revive my first Old Republic campaign, The Flames of War.
Just to ease anyone who might think it will be another militaristic campaign, it won´t. I just like that title, since I think it captures the setting of the Galaxy, as I intend this campaign to spread across the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War, and possibly beyond that.
What I am aiming for is really a campaign in the spirit of the Knights of the Old Republic games (or really any one of Bioware´s RPGs, such as Mass Effect or Baldur´s Gate II), which includes both battle, negotiations, infiltration, as well as making moral choices and accepting the consequences. While the origin point may be throwing you straight into a war, the story could lead you potentially anywhere, and hopefully I might be able to throw in a few good plot twists as well.
The characters would be slightly higher level than before (I´m thinking 5th level), and the following restrictions would be enforced:

* No Mandalorians. The campaign will start around the time of the Mandalorian Wars and I don´t want any defectors. One established in canon is quite enough for me.
* Characters must be of a persuasion to fight and take action against the Mandalorian threat and have a reason to be involved on the front. For example, this means that any Jedi characters likely has to be Jedi Crusaders, or at least willing to defy the Council´s orders against taking action. Non-Jedi can be of pretty much any profession as long as they follows the same guideline, ranging from diplomats to soldiers, from mercenaries to smugglers.
* I will be allowing use of all official books, but will ban anything not era-appropriate (pretty much only applicable to species and some equipment).
* As always, the above is only 99% set in stone. If you make a good enough case, and an interesting enough character, I might be persuaded to allow it anyway.

If I receive enough interest, I´ll throw up a casting call, so don´t submit stats just yet.
