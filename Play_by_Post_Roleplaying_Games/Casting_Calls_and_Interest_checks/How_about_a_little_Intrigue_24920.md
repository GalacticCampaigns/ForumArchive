# How about a little Intrigue?

### **Anonymous** (2010-11-27 19:25:28)

Hello All,
I have recently picked up the pocket edition of Song of Ice and Fire Roleplay from Green Ronin. I'm loving this ruleset so far. I don't necessarily have any plans for an epic, sweeping campaign, but I'd like to know if there are any interested parties who'd like to try it out???

You can count me in, Commandant.

I may be provided I don't have to pick up a copy of the ruleset. I'm flat broke!

I just finished reading Game of Thrones and have been really curious to try the game. I'd love to get involved in a campaign...

Hey All,
Green Ronin's website has a copy of the quick-start rules for SIFRP available as a free download. I would really recommend it. You don't have to buy the game book unless you like the ruleset. I am adapting one of the adventures currently, I have pre-gens available. Download the quick-start, have a look at the rules. If it sounds like something you'd have fun with, send me a PM letting me know that you'd like IN. Also, which of the Quickstart Pre-gens you like (with minor changes to fit the adventure I intend to run). First come, first served, so get downloading!
I intend to start the campaign off small. The game will be very local, and grow into something bigger as we progress. In other words, I intend for the Game of Thrones to be played, though on a minor house to house level. Warfare is an option, although the troops used will probably not be massive. So don't anybody get overwhelmed right now. Any character is an option. You want to be a fierce warrior, either selling or pledging his loyalties one way or the other? You want to be a Noble schemer, attempting through Intrigue or Diplomacy to increase your power? I'll do my very best to make all of these things a viable option.
Let's Do Something Magnificent! PM me with RSVP's, questions and requests!

My last post still applies, but there is an official casting call thread!

Pfft, I wish I had just finished reading the books. Then I wouldn't be dedicating a quarter of my book-related rage to a certain bearded procrastinator.

I just stopped waiting after book 4. My life is Worry Free.
