# [RoTE]Starcrossed Chronicles

I'd like to run a campaign that chronicles the lives of a few characters before, during and after **Order 66**. We'd open with the onset of the Clone Wars (22 BBY) and play out a chapter there. Next we'd fast forward to a few days before Order 66 (19 BBY) and through the actual event. Finally, we'd pick up about twenty years later (2 BBY) with the creation of the Corellian Treaty. That's three chapters, and while I think that's plenty I'd love to have an epilogue with the characters on Alderaan when it's destroyed (hence the campaign name). It's essentially the story of heroes who worked behind the scenes and never received the recognition they deserved.
I'm open to solo players, but if folks want to play as a party that's cool too. This would be a campaign for the "good guys", or at least the "ambiguously altruistic guys". The catch of the whole fast-forward thing is that while you might start in 22 BBY as a 3rd-level character, *you'd gain at least a level between each chapter* to represent how you passed the time (you'd be welcome to recall those events shamelessly, just not play them out) - finally ending at level 5 (though I'm pretty open to starting levels too).
So to summarize:

* **Chapter One** - Start of the Clone Wars
* **Chapter Two** - Order 66
* **Chapter Three** - Birth of the Alliance
* **Epilogue** - Alderaan

It may seem epic (because it is) but I'm really only talking about one or two encounters per chapter - I heed the warnings of the PbP medium's timescale with respect. I can commit to no more than a few (3 or 4) players whether solo or not. Canon will be loosely followed when applicable. Any suggestions for House Rules, starting levels, etc. are welcome. No class restrictions really, but I definitely would need references to non-core stuff. I think I covered everything I was suppose to... Thoughts? Comments? Observations?
[Edit: By "one or two encounters per chapter" I don't mean just battling on a map, it can be anything. I'm saying the chapter will only cover a few days' time. In this way all classes are appropriate - frontline soldiers, Jedi on the run, senator, whatever. Game on!]

Sounds interesting, though unfortunately at this time I think I won't be applying. Already doing one Clone Wars / Order 66 game and that's enough for me at present.
Good luck!

might wanna start either at a higher level or have a larger jump in level between chapters, Order 66 is a time of epicness, and seems like it would need some epic chars. say start at 3, then jump to 5, then 7, then 9 etc. or start 5, then jump two. i like the idea though. Alicia's char creation rules are a hodgepodge of some of the best on site, they're always useful.

**Alicia** - totally understand, and **Mag** - yeah, you're right on both counts. Advice from either of you is very welcome! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
I'm very flexible with the ideas of levels and character creation in general; I'm mostly wanting to try the chronicling thing. A couple solo threads that weave together at pivotal points would be neat too - friendships forged at the Battle of Geonosis that stand the test of time, despite being stationed in different systems later or something.
Now that I think more about the levels specifically, perhaps starting at **5**, then advancing **3** each time would be nice. It allows for those coveted prestige classes to get some use.
