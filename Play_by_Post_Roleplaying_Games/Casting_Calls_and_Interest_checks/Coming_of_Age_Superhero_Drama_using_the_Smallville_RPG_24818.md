# Coming of Age Superhero Drama using the Smallville RPG

### **simplyscribed** (2010-10-12 10:25:21)

All right gang, rather than just ask who's interested, I figure I better give you reasons why you should be. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Why should I want to try this system?</span>
The Smallville RPG is published by Margaret Weis Productions (or MWP) and uses the Cortex system also used in other MWP publications including the RPGs for Supernatural, Battlestar Galactica, and Serenity. You may already know the system, which at it's core is as simple as "roll 2 or more dice, keep the highest 2, and compare against a difficulty number".
Where the Smallville RPG differs is it's strong focus on character and relationships. Rather than give characters ability scores like Strength and Dexterity, it gives them character values like Duty and Love. Rather than give characters skills, it gives them relationships with other PCs (known as leads) and significant NPCs (known as features). A character's Values and Relationships are their Drives: how well you perform in a given action depends how much you push yourself, and how much you push yourself is dependent on which of your Drives are at stake. So, when you attempt something that requires a roll, the dice available to you is determined by who and/or what is motivating you to perform the task. Let's use Lois and Clark as an example: If Clark is trying to catch Lois as she falls off a window ledge, his player would pick up dice for his ‘Love’ Value and his ‘Lois’ Relationship. This system accurately creates a style of cinematic play that reflects the "soap opera" style developments of a series like Smallville.
Perhaps the most striking example of how characters and relationships are key to this system is the character creation method, which is actually a collaborative effort to form a relationship map. This map not only determines what ends up on your character sheet, but also gives you the chance to create and define some of the key locations and NPCs that will be used in the game, as well as how these leads interact with your lead and others. Players add their leads to the map and then take it in turns to add new characters, new locations, and define relationships between existing characters and locations. Nobody can change who your lead is but you, so they cannot dictate how he or she feels about a person or place, but other players can, if they wish to, define the other side of the relationship: determining how an NPC feels about your lead. A lot of power to affect the game ends up in player's hands here, and this theme continues during play as well. It requires a mature group, focused on telling a satisfyingly awesome tale for everyone.
For further breakdown of this system, see the informative RPGNet review here: <!-- m -->[http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/14/14894.phtml](http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/14/14894.phtml "http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/14/14894.phtml")<!-- m -->
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Why should I want to play in a game like this?</span>
The Smallville RPG has plenty of room for superheroic action, but it also focuses a great deal on the more mundane aspects of life: the trials, tribulations, and relationships of it's young heroes. You should expect heavy roleplaying from any game using it as it's core: even before the game has begun, thanks to the relationship map, your character will be defined by friendships, enmities, loyalties, betrayals, crushes, and loves. As the game progresses, these relationship will grow, falter, or be obliterated by the events taking place and you will get to decide exactly how this affects your character, and show it!
If I were to run a game, I wouldn't actually want to set it in the Smallville universe. My two preferred options are:
a) a similar origins tale to Smallville, but for the characters of Gotham City in which the players would take on the role of well known Gotham heroes, antiheroes, and villains such as Bruce Wayne, Harvey Dent, and Teddy Kord. You would know a lot about the character already and this would help you build them and set growth goals, but you would also be able to make the character your own in ways you may never have dreamed possible. As GM I would certainly be making Gotham my own sandbox... while trying to stay thematically true.
or b) a wholly original setting where the characters are made entirely by you, but we would be going through the same kinds of troubled origins. You would be able to explore your own concepts from their very beginnings as they begin to grow into their powers, their responsibilities, and learn to juggle these with their lives and relationships. As GM I would be happy to develop an exciting newly emerging superheroic world for characters to discover and immerse themselves in.

Express your interest by posting below. If you have any questions feel free to ask. You can post which of options a or b you would prefer, but please also answer the poll so I have an at-a-glance reference.

I put one down for Gotham. Really, I don´t mind a new setting either, though it seems like this system differs a lot from pretty much anything I´ve ever tried, so I feel like it could be nice to have a setting that is at least decently familiar. That way, I just have to mind learning the system, not taking in the setting as well.
And of course, if a chance to play as the Dark Knight comes along, you take it <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->

I am so down for a Gotham game. Batman has been my favourite character since as long as I can remember reading comics. Would Batman be established already or would we be playing those roles like in Smallville series?

If we did Gotham, Bruce Wayne and pals would still be in school/college and would yet to have entered into the world of superheroes. So the latter.

After reading the review I have to say this system sounds really really interesting and I think I'll buy it. However, I don't think I have time to commit to another game at the moment. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> If the situation changes I'll let you know.

Pity, I feel that 4 players is probably a minimum requirement for this game, with definite room for 5 or 6.

Well...find one more and I might just change my mind.

Technically you would be the fourth interested party, since Magic voted without posting to the thread. However, it seems like a risky idea to start a game on such a shaky footing: if you say you're spread thin no doubt you are. So let's say the game will go ahead if we find a fifth interested party (or fourth if you decide to bow out after all, Valheru), just for that extra security.
I may play a character of my own too, rather than just assuming GMing duties. Allowing others first dibs on the more popular characters, of course...

Fair enough.

### **Anonymous** (2010-10-30 21:09:49)

Id be interested in this as well.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-10-30 21:32:16)

Very well, it looks like we have a group of 5. Since the overwhelming majority of votes is for a game set in Gotham, I'll put in a request for a forum called Gotham Genesis. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
