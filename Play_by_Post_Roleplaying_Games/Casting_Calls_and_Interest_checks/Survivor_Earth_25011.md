*It is 2047 A.D. The robot revolt is over, and the machines have won. These ruthless Artificial Intelligences – the AIs – have exterminated most of humanity. The survivors are hunted like animals, or face slow death in the robots’ brutal labor camps. Earth itself has become a bizarre post-apocalyptic world, populated by robot cities, lethal cyberbeasts, even mutant animals. Entire countries have been transformed into hostile wastelands or altered by nanotechnology run amok.
A lucky few have escaped death or enslavement. Groups of dedicated guerrillas are forming to oppose the robot overlords and to liberate mankind. Bands of nomads roam the highways on cycles or captured ‘bots. Junkrats hide in the ruins, dodging extermination sweeps and marauder gangs. Survivalists hold out in fortified wilderness enclaves. And in the Washington Protectorate and United Kingdom, two human nations continue to resist the AIs valiantly – or are they mere puppets?
Over a dozen years have passed since the revolt: no longer is it a simple struggle of man against machine. The AIs have carved up the world into rival fiefdoms and now intrigue fiercely among themselves, even recruiting human janissaries and cyborg warriors, or creating new races via genetic engineering. A new power awakens on the moon, and a mysterious organization called VIRUS has arisen, seeking to unite the scattered guerrilla armies.
The Reign of Steel is an era of chaos, fear and hope, a time when bold individuals can shape the destiny of humanity. It is the end of the world – and the birth of a strange new future.* -**Introduction**, GURPS: Reign Of Steel, page 4<div style="text-align: center;">

If escaping robot-run slave camps sounds like fun, read on...
If running guns across nanovirus infested wastelands sounds like a great way to make a living, read on...
If you think John Connor relaxes too much, read on...
I'm willing to run a one-shot adventure as a possible lead-in to a full campaign. It would be **GURPS 3e**, and you can get **GURPS Lite** for free at the bottom of this post - that's the very basics of the system. We'd be using some advanced combat rules and loads of equipment and skills not contained in that, but it gives you a good idea how the system works if you don't know. I'd like to begin with the PCs attempting to escape a slave camp, but where it goes from there is up to them. I'd like to also emphasize survival as much as anything - dehydration, starvation, disease, and exhaustion should be just as dangerous as Vulture drone patrols.

* **Frequency**: 2+ posts per week minimum

* **Player Number**: 4 or less, can be singleplayer(s)

* **Required Books**: GURPS Lite 3e is absolutely essential if you don't have the full book. It's extremely vanilla though, and I'll be pulling from several sources. You can too - just cite them. Stats for equipment and such can/will be provided when necessary.

* **Character Builds**: No cyborgs or mutants - just stock human beings, 120pts. I've never been a fan of the disadvantage/advantage/attributes ratio, so feel free to put points wherever and I'll reserve the right to dialogue with you about your choices. Backgrounds are fairly wide open since you'll begin in a labor camp and could have arrived there from pretty much anywhere.

Let me know if you're up for all this, or any variation thereof - I definitely am!

okay, i like the idea, but i hate new systems so it would take me a while to build a char. upside to this is the setting, makes it easy to use just the base rules for building lol. if i play you'll have to explain lots to me as we go, and i will be the typical gamer and forget it from one round to the next :P
edit: more i look at this the more i wanna be a lazy gamer and let you build my char and handle all the mechanics. i'll roleplay him though lol

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-13 15:52:42)

I only know **GURPS** and **Saga**. I suppose I could augment **Saga** to fit this setting, but it really wouldn't be the same. I'll try to have a couple character ideas/templates up in the next few days. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

### **Magical2099** (2011-04-13 15:58:42)

saga is actually kinda easy to adapt to most settings. just outlaw the Force and what doesn't fit ei: lightsabers, certain weapons based on time, etc. for instance, i used it once to run a fantasy game, folks were just limited to simple weapons. worked fine.

Hmm, this does sound a bit interesting, but after reading through the rules a bit there is just something about the system that...I don´t know...
On a different note, the discussion of other systems, coupled with the proposed setting for this game reminded me of another system Rowen made me aware of a long time ago. It´s called *Eclipse Phase*, and features a post-apocalyptic setting, though a more sci-fi, high tech one from what I get. I think it´s a piece of cake to learn, as it´s percentage-based, and it looks really interesting. We didn´t get anything going back then, but I figured that if the interest for this GURPS campaign was low, it might be possible to run something similar in another system.
Here´s a bit I cut from the Core rulebook, describing the system and setting a bit:
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Several themes pervade Eclipse Phase, some of which the reader may not be intimately familiar with. The following helps define these themes so that as players
read further into this rulebook, they gain a solid understanding of how Eclipse Phase builds on such themes to create its unique setting. Post-apocalyptic is a term used to describe fiction set after a cataclysmic event has ended human civilization as we know it (usually accompanied by loss of human life on an almost unthinkable scale). The exact mechanism of the disaster is usually unimportant: nuclear war, plague, asteroid strike, and so on. The importance of the theme is the human condition. If
the world we know is torn away from us and humans suffer horrors beyond imagining in this transformation to a post-apocalyptic setting, how does humanity cope? Do we survive and thrive and overcome? Or do we lose our own humanity in the process, or ultimately fall to extinction? Those are the questions that drive this genre.
To conspire means “to join in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or to use such means to accomplish a lawful end.” As such, a conspiracy theory attributes the ultimate cause of an event or a chain of events (whether political, societal or historical) to a secret group of individuals with immense power (including political, wealth and so on) who hide their activities from public view while manipulating events to achieve their goals, regardless of consequences. Many conspiracy theories contend that a host of the greatest events of history were initiated and ultimately controlled by such secret organizations. Of equal importance is the silent struggle between clandestine groups, waging a secret war behind the scenes to determine who influences the future.
Horror takes many forms, but in Eclipse Phase it is more psychological than gore. It is the uncertainty of survival, the suspense of finding malevolent things among the stars, the fear of the unknown, the dread of facing Things That Should Not Be, the revulsion when encountering alien things, and the sickening realization of the wrong and ghastly things that transhumans are capable of doing to themselves and each other. Horror also arises both from the comprehension that there are scary things beyond our understanding inhabiting our universe and that transhumanity may be its own worst enemy. Despite all of the technological tools and advances available to future transhumans, they still face terrors like losing control of their own identities, their perceptions, and their mental faculties— not to mention their future as a species.
Eclipse Phase takes all of these themes and weaves them together in a transhuman setting. The postapocalyptic angle covers the understanding of all that transhumanity has lost, the fight against extinction, and how much of that is a struggle against our own nature. The conspiracy side delves into the nature of the secret organizations that play key roles in determining transhumanity’s future and how the actions of determined individuals can change the lives of many. The horror perspective explores the results of humanity’s self-inflicted transformations and how some of these changes effectively make us non-human. Tying it all together is an awareness of the massive indifference and the terrible alien-ness that pervades the universe and how transhumanity is insignificant against such a backdrop. Offsetting these themes, however, Eclipse Phase also asserts that there is still hope, that there is still something worth fighting for, and that transhumanity can pave its own path toward the future.

I´ve always been quite interested in trying it out, but I´d like to be playing not GMing =P Anyway, if it sounds interesting, I can front you a torrent (fully legal) to get the Core book.

That looks really cool, but it seems to have more of a thriller/horror element than I think I'm skilled at. I know what you mean about GURPS though, it can get crunchy if not done right. I'm less interested in the system and more interested in the setting. It could easily be a bunch of slaves on Raxus Prime or set during the Clone Wars with evil droids overseeing vast work camps. I want to push the survival aspect and see lots of robots get beat up, so whatever accomplishes that I guess. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
That having been said, here's a snippet of what some **Saga** adaptations could be for playing the *Reign of Steel* setting, though I'm not stuck on the system:

* Some **Knowledge** fields will be discarded, as things like *Galactic Lore* and *Bureaucracy* don't really apply.
* The daily **Basic Survival** DC is 20, not 15 - the world is a harsh place, and failure could mean anything (from not finding food that day to running into an exterminator patrol). You can't take 10 or 20 on this, but something like *Knack* would still apply.
* A new skill, **Armoury (Int)**, with fields of study for each of the weapon groups. This skill will be used to repair or build (if adequate materials are available) weapons. **Mechanics** will apply to vehicles, robots, powered armor and exoskeletons but not weaponry.
* Combat will be unavoidable at times, and **ammo** isn't exactly plentiful.
* The **Scavenger** feat (*TFU*, p.35) will be particularly useful and is to be considered available to all classes, but there may be a DC associated with its use.

Like I said, I'm very open to suggestions, and I'll take a look at that *Eclipse Phase* when you get the chance DA - just message me.
Thanks everyone! Any other thoughts?

You can find the torrent [here](http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5136701/Eclipse_Phase_-_RPG "http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5136701/Eclipse_Phase_-_RPG"). The number of seeders is a bit low, but I got it down in like 5 minutes.
On the idea of modding Saga to suit the setting, I have a few questions though:

* What would be the exact purpose of a new Armoury skill? Mechanics can already cover building, maintaining and modding all sorts of weapons. Also, even if you can probably get away with just changing the damage to Piercing and cutting it down one dice and reducing ammo, it seems the arsenal of avaiable weapons will be greatly reduced. I mean, the Pistols group would be pretty much Slug, Heavy Slug, Semi-Automatic Slug and possibly something more.
* What would be the point of the DC for the Scavenger feat? The feat is already quite limited, and you need to find some suitable junk to use it.

I see what you mean now.
My thoughts with the **Armoury** were to avoid characters all choosing **Survival** and **Mechanics** and just avoiding the whole "bleak existence" concept. I was trying to spread the load around a little, and since we'd drop **UtF** it seemed alright. As far as the DC for **Scavenger** - a lot of the ruins or places where you'd expect to find things have been pretty well picked over, and I didn't want you to think that you could just search anywhere for materials.
All this is good stuff, and perhaps I need to re-vamp a bit and make another interest check. I looked at the QuickStart for Eclipse Phase btw, and *wow*. I definitely like the percentile idea, but the setting makes my head spin. Perhaps I can strip the core mechanics out though, we shall see.
Thanks everyone, I appreciate the feedback!

i don't see the weapons being an issue. all the blaster weapons are basically identical anyway, they just have minor differences that can translate easily after dropping a die and the stun setting. Rotary Blaster Cannon becomes minigun. Carbine with folded stock becomes SMG, heavy rifle becomes LMG. You could actually leave Ion weapons (or at least grenades) to represent EMP technology, which i imagine any rebellion fighting machines would have. Rocket launchers would be about the limit on large area weapons, but there aren't that many to lose so it's no biggie.
BW, you wouldn't have to set on Raxus, it could be the very setting you're talking about. you just take the SW stuff and rename/tweak it appropriately: YVH droid becomes a Terminator, Probe droid becomes a Sentinel etc etc.
The armory skill doesn't make alot of sense, that's what makes saga great is a lack of overlapping skills. you could ban skill focus on character creation and require education in play to gain it later, or you could require a knowledge tech roll before allowing a first attempt at working on something (the result of the knowledge roll would grant a bonus/inflict a penalty on the mechanics roll) until the character had successfully worked on that tech a certain number of times (okay you fixed 6 of these things so far, so no more knowledge roll required).

Somebody's done this beeeefooooore... <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
I see what you mean, and totally dig the Knowledge check idea. I'm going to hibernate on these ideas for a few days and report back. Thanks for the thoughts, and you all obviously have more experience than me at this, so feel free to keep them coming.

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-15 15:24:01)

Just an update: I've looked over the *Phase Eclipse* system, and it looks pretty decent. I'm going to can the **Survivor: Earth** interest check and work on something for that instead. If you're still curious, I can get you the core book - it's free (but really well done and certainly worthy of a donation) and has some great artwork to help visualize the setting. There are sample characters as well, if that's something that appeals to you. It's quite similar to what I had in mind actually, and I think it will still satisfy the core ideas of *survival* and *blowing up robots*. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
I'll be back in a couple days, or weeks, or however long it takes to wrap my mind around the concept of "re-sleeving"...
