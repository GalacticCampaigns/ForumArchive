# A Shared World

### **simplyscribed** (2010-10-26 16:11:44)

As you probably know this site has long had a shared setting project, an alternative Star Wars galaxy called Kalium. However, although we are first and foremost a Star Wars community I know there are a lot of people here who happily (or perhaps preferably) play in other settings.
I was just wondering if there is interest in a non-Star Wars shared setting project? Perhaps a fantastic world of magic and dragons, or a sprawling city full of superpowered men and women?
Any takers? Post your interest in such a shared project along with ideas for genres you might like to take part in. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
