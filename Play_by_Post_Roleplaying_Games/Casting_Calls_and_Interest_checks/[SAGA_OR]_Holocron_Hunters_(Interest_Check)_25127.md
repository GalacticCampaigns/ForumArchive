# [SAGA OR] Holocron Hunters (Interest Check)

### **jaybee3** (2011-12-07 09:43:31)

A band of like minded, morally neutral individuals have decided to capitalise on the opulence of the dead. *'It's not like they need it, right?'* They've become so successful in fact, they've turned what they do into a sport amongst themselves.
This adventure/campaign will be a race to xk credits (depending on duration). Expect pvp and ship combat. *'After all ships sell pretty well'* The basic format will be the group working together to raid tombs/temples, by solving puzzles and combating enemies. After which the players will make their way back to a hub/base and the choices they make will then affect subsequent raids.

* Will they stick together or go it solo by backstabbing their allies?
* Will they meet at the rendezvous or run off with their spoils?
* Will they destroy/learn/sell the artifacts they might find?
* Will they ambush their comrade as he leaves the planets atmosphere in his freighter or help him navigate to another system and share in the spoils?
* Will they accept a new contract straight away or follow their buyer back to their home and see what else they can find?

Each of these options will affect the game in one way or another as the players race to make the most credits.
I'm looking for 1 or 2 players to start with (as it's my first time GMing a SAGA game) and we'll see if it works from there.
Any C&C gladly welcome.

I could be interested in this, sounds like a good campaign idea. Here are a few ideas for how to set it up:

* I would suggest making this a higher level game (at least 7+). The higher level, the more options players have to work with, and the more durable they are. And if PvP is going to occur, it is more fun if you can get the fights to become more memorable than having your character cut down in 1-2 rounds.
* Depending on how much interest this generates, I wouldn´t be shy about taking on maybe 3-4 players, even though you´re new to GMing. The game is balanced around 4 players, and I´ve also found out that having a few players around can help you with running the game. In some instances I´ve even found it to be easier to run a party game than my single player campaigns.

Cheers for the feedback <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Yeah I guess more the merrier then you guys can point out when and where I cock up.
As for the level, I was gonna have it start at level 1, then you guys would be at least forced to work together for a few levels? But if you think something above 7 would be more fun so you can kick of straight away then I'm open to that too definately.

### **Alicia** (2011-12-08 12:52:26)

You'll definitely get more interest if it's higher levels. 3+ is generally the average and is a good start for pbp games. 7+ is good for when you want the characters to have a great deal of skill to start.
I for one would be more interested in a campaign higher than 1. It generally takes too long and games generally don't last long enough to get to those higher levels. A reason, but not the only why most GMs will start higher than 1.

And if you're going to somehow incorporate the job generator dynamic, or really most of the sample adventures, a higher level is better. CL-2 for a level 1 character is ultra-lame. And bear in mind higher levels means you can setup more interesting baddies for your players - like naked Togorians and zombie robots. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
The appeal of having level 1 characters is strong, at least for me, because it means lots of room for development. Like Alicia says though - you probably won't last long enough to make it through a level or two.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-08 17:40:44)

Also, simple enough, I think most 1st level characters that tries to raid the tomb of a Sith Lord usually ends up dead pretty soon.

---

### **jaybee3** (2011-12-09 04:50:11)

Pretty true, heh. I was looking at some traps and a level 1 character would quickly be falling down the condition track for what I have in store.
So if I'm settled on 3+ players.
~~What about if I used higher than normal xp growth to make it easier to hit the higher levels? Or would that just make it unbalanced and the players would just spend too long editing their character sheets than actually playing in the game?~~
Settled on 7+ too, as you'll need at least some skill to find Ancient Sith Lord tombs in Fringe Space :P
Other things I want to try and use:
+ Astrogation rules too, especially if players want to get the drop on their comrades at a specific location.
+ Crews, either with your ship, hireable to help you haul loot around or paid to ambush your colleagues.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-10 06:46:32)

If you want to use Astrogation rules, were you going to use the ones in the book, or did you have some homemade system in mind?
Because if you were planning on using the one in the book...well it just stinks. And if you were planning on allowing people to use it tactically to get the drop on people, that´s going to be pretty damn hard, since actual travel time is a random variable, and not something you can reliably plan on.
I´m afraid I don´t have any good suggestion on how to fix it atm, I just wanted to make you aware that (at least IMO), the default astrogation system is pretty stupid.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-10 10:55:22)

I remember in GURPS: Space there were a list of different Faster Than Light travel options and a lot about time dilation. You could build ships from scratch (mechanically as much as in-game) which could be very time-consuming - but it really worked well for custom travel ideas. The easiest (in my opinion) was the Stargate option where you just enter one gate and then come out another near-instantaneously. Makes FTL drives unnecessary for most modes of transportation (maybe military would have them) and solves the time dilation issue. Obvious hazards would be if someone destroyed a gate while you were using it, or moving the gate to an ambush location or switching gate destinations or something, but it was a pretty easy mechanic to work with. There was a really interesting (and number-heavy) planet/system generation option too.
Traveling in real-time isn't that bad, it's just sort of weird because then you have to figure out what's going on in hyperspace - is it all blurry stars, or bright pink nebulae, or completely dark, etc. Plus - what happens if a ship gets blown up while traveling at FTL? Different settings handle this different ways, but not in any clear mechanic that I can tell.
What's weird about SW is that it's a dice roll based on your engine. I would either make a flat-rate of travel (rating in days), a standard travel time (always 24 hours, no matter how far), or an instant-jump (like the stargate option without the gate). If you have a map you could do something like an hour/parsec (which is probably closer to the movies, in my opinion). It means re-defining hyper-travel but I agree with DA: the SW system isn't that great. I'm not ultra-familiar with *Starships of the Galaxy* though, so maybe they have additional ideas.
It's similar to the survival rules in SW - GURPS does it way better, in my opinion. Very detailed if you like. I think it's one of those things where since it wasn't a prominent feature in the movies (or the books I've read) it's sort of a throw-away inclusion, ultimately left to the GM to tweak more than anything. If you wanted to make ambushing based on astrogation but keep the SAGA system you could rely on some sort of sensors to determine when a ship made a hyperjump, where from, and/or in what direction. In that way a decent **Use Computer** check could plot an intercept course and the ship would regulate it's hyperdrive to emerge at the right time. A sort of Fourth-Dimensional Plotting Hyperdrive thing. The first ship would fly RAW, but the intercepting ship would adjust accordingly. Could be a lovely trinket for a first mission...

---

### **jaybee3** (2011-12-11 05:40:51)

Yeah I've just had a read, theyre not hat great are they :s (I must have been thinking of a different system). SotG adds back in Hyperspace Hazards and mishaps and system damage tables and the check for detecting hyperspace travel.
The old d20 book has travel time tables. I.E. It takes 24 hours to travel from Core to the Inner Rim (these also have DCs too and depending on by how much you fail, travel time is extended).
WEG used the following:
Within a sector 1d6 hours
Within a Rim 2d6 hours
Add 1d6 hours per region crossed. (Deep Core, Core, Colonies, Expansion Region, Mid Rim, Outer Rim, Wild Space, Unknown Regions)
Multiply the speed by target destination.
Hyperspace Route X0.5
Easy X1 Core, Colonies, Expansion Region
Normal X2 , Mid Rim Outer Rim
Hard X3 Deep Core, Wild Space, Unknown Regions
What I could do is (to speed it up from real time) compare results between players heading to the same destination based off what they've rolled and then give the winning player a circumstantial bonus if it's grants him a reasonable amount of time to prepare? Or just scratch this idea, and use: you tell me who you want to jump and we'll set something up (within reason) :P

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-11 09:52:37)

I remember the RCR had those charts, and I think those would be your best bet, even if the timing sounds a bit inflated at times. The main problem I see with the SECR system (and the same goes for that WEG system you posted), is that times are **random**. If you and I both have the same skill at astrogation (and simply plots a course, no "aggressive" plotting), and takes brand new, identical ships without any previous data input, and plots a course to the same place, it may still take me up to **6** times longer than you to get there! Sure, I may accept a diff on a few minutes or so depending on that we may not jump at the same time, or you may need to go to the 'fresher when I don´t before takeoff, but **6** times as long??!! Also, unless we have cutting edge hyperdrives both, that x6 multiplier could mean weeks, even months in time difference...
Basically (in lack of any system that makes sense), I´d treat hyperspace travel as a plot tool, using simple guidelines, which I could help you establish if you want.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-11 22:28:03)

Depending on what you're looking for, you could always just skip the random roll and have both ships emerge from hyperspace at the same time, but then leave it to the sublight engines to do the intercepting. I think most ships give a speed in km/hr or something, right? So whip out your graphing calculator and let geometry be the judge. But we can't all get along with math...
Page 12 of *Starships of the Galaxy* has those **Detecting Hyperspace Travel** notes, and honestly I'd bank on them more than anything. I'd add maybe an extra 5 to the DC to emerge on an intercept course (meaning a couple seconds after and a few hundred meters behind) and just let that do. As far as the random time variable - let the first ship determine that and then just match it with the pursuing ship. I don't know how major it would be to the plot or anything, but if this was an expected occurance I think I'd see about getting the players some sort of special device that negates the additional +5 to the DC, or to allow it at all. Could be a very handy thing for pirates. If they miss the DC by 5 or less they emerge in the right spot but in whatever the ordinary random travel time would be (with a small chance that it could indeed work out) according to their hyper rating. If they miss the DC by more than 5 I'd say it was in a random time *and* off course. The difference being that if they don't botch the Astrogation roll too bad they might be able to pickup another signature if the ship they were following made another jump.

---

### **jaybee3** (2011-12-12 05:43:20)

So if we go for fixed travel times, ( <!-- m -->[http://swrpgrc.com/files/Saga%20Edition &#8230; Travel.pdf](http://swrpgrc.com/files/Saga%20Edition%20Resources/Player%20and%20GM%20Aids/Hyperspace%20Travel.pdf "http://swrpgrc.com/files/Saga%20Edition%20Resources/Player%20and%20GM%20Aids/Hyperspace%20Travel.pdf")<!-- m --> has the table :p ), which can be modified by your hyperdrive (Maybe not up to the drastic 6x...) and the starship skills (outside of combat) as a plot tool.
The Detecting Hyperspace Travel can be used to find a trace of ships that have recently jumped (The DC increasing with the age of background radiation and if the ship is trying to mask it's signature). If successful, then head towards the destination on an intercept, and depending on your hyperdrive, you might emerge ahead of your target. Fail and roll a second die, the result of which will determine by how much you miscalculated, and I'll determine your fate in the posts. "BW, it seems your droid and navcomputer have been lying to you and they've led you straight into a pirate controlled system."
Minor:
+ You come out [of hyperspace] somewhere else in the system but at the correct time (in accordance with your drive)
+ You come out at the right place but in real time (i.e. you travel at the speed of your target and so would arrive x hours after they do, providing you have the same or better hyperdrive)
+ You come out somwhere else in the system in real time
Major:
+ You come out somewhere else in the sector/nearby system
+ You come out in a different rim entirely.

I have discovered an inordinate amount of droid pirates on these forums. It's simultaneously refreshing and disturbing.

So are you using separate threads or is everyone together in the same thread?

---

### **jaybee3** (2011-12-13 12:02:41)

I was thinking location based threads? But I don't know how that would go down?
Or have individual threads when people are off on their own, then when they are together have a group thread and any conflicts resolved in another one?

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-13 12:06:38)

Now see location-based threads would be interesting I think, since it would pretty much solve your hypertravel problem (it takes three days from this spot to this spot, etc.) and as long as you made a clear break within the thread it would look all neat and organized. It would probably be crazy to manage though - it might be better to have the locations all described in one spot (like what Mag did with the Arena) and just game in another. Searching for stuff would be tricky. I don't know, I have a million ideas similar to all this running around in my brain. It could end up being a ton of work though if you're not careful. Just my two cents.

---

### **jaybee3** (2011-12-13 12:24:31)

Yeah that's what I was thinking: Location x1...etc, City y1...etc, Hyperspace.
Hyperspace
--------------
GM Post (Players 1, 2 and 3 entered hyperspace from Location x)
Player1 Post,
Player2 Post,
Player3 post...etc
GM post with summaries of all players and lots of use of the word meanwhile and linebreaks.
Player1 post,
GM post (player1 with his superior hyperdrive has left hyperspace)
Player2 post,
Player3 post,
GM post (players2 and 3 were pulled out of hyperspace near a binary star)
...etc
The only problem might be with metagaming (player1 seems player2 appear in the hyperspace thread and he decides to jump to his destination)...but then that's a problem if they just read someone elses thread in general :p

---

### **jaybee3** (2011-12-14 03:56:26)

Level 7+ (36point buy in?)
Basic Piloting, combat and survival recommended (advanced piloting if you want to kill each other in space recommended)
Your own ship, either bought outright with creds from generation, bought on loan using said creds (either legitimately or via a shark) or 'jacked when the campaign begins. (I need to check vessel prices though, if anyone has a link to the base models or the sourcebook while I'm at work, much appreciated :p - as you may need a little boost in creds to be able to afford them)

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-14 05:30:35)

Just as a heads-up, we will, unless you expect us all to be Nobles with the Wealth talent. IIRC, there are very few ships you can buy used for under 10k, and most of them still costs in the ranges of 5-6k.

---

### **jaybee3** (2011-12-14 06:03:28)

6-8k is that all? It was 10k for Obiwan's passage to Alderaan.
The 6-8k: Is that for like a small ship? or for something bigger like a YT?
Loan(from company): is 10% downpayment and 3% a month for 3 years?
Loan(from shark): is 0% down payment and 20% a month for a year?
(I can't remember the exact rulings and percentages (but I think they follow that structure), so they might be more viable options if you want specific class skills etc. Plus I never knew so many people of wealth entered into such competitions...what am I saying: they're bored...spare cash....of course they would, either that or it's against their will (a la Battle Royal)...hmmm that's given me an idea :P)
If you guys are going to be killing each other, I think I might rule out using Destiny Points against other players, as I doubt your destiny is to kill player x (when you won't have even met....unless you guys come up with a background together or something) and plus an autocritical is too dangerous :p

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-14 06:18:08)

OK, correction, it´s been a while since I read up on ships, though I wasn´t wrong in my original assumption =P
A quick scan of the SECR and Starships of the Galaxy reveals 2 ships under 20k, and one is a ship that only supports droid pilots, and the other is the Cloakshape Fighter, for 15k. The rest were at least 23k from what I could tell. Now there could be exception in other sources, and maybe some templates to modify pricing, but I´d take that as some general guidelines.

---

### **jaybee3** (2011-12-14 07:44:33)

They're bought as new I take it? To be honest if you took Noble's Wealth at the start you could in theory have a fleet of ships....

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-14 07:51:25)

Not really no, those costs were for used ships. I think they cost in general at least double, probably triple that as new.
A Noble who takes Wealth at 1st level and then only levels up in Noble would have gained 140k from that talent. And of course it depends on what ships you want and their quality, but I´d say you´d be only 1 or 2 ships for that.

---

### **jaybee3** (2011-12-14 08:13:15)

I'll need to consult the rules and prices tonight, unless someone can find them for me / post a link.
But I may end up working on:

* Everyone starts with the same ship for free,
* A buy in with creds and you get loaned x creds to spend as you choose (I mean there's no saying you *need* a ship…it just gives you independence) on equipment before the games begin

---

### **chiech22** (2011-12-14 21:07:15)

What about upkeep and repairs? If it is pvp there might be lots of damaged ships ,,,

I agree. The busiest I've ever seen the site was when I first joined last year - and that was after Christmas. Then it sort of dwindled over the Summer. It's on the upswing again but **TOR** *and* **Christmas/New Years** - lots of things going on. I don't think I'll be able to commit as a player but I certainly don't mind helping out from time to time.

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-19 11:46:27)

Most of the re-req's include *7th level* which means our last class could be one of them. In fact I think **Independent Droid** is the only one that *doesn't* have that, but I could be wrong. I have some ideas forming for a Gand Findsman and I'm always looking to play some unique droid characters. With enough credits I could have one very modified metal man. What are your thoughts on post-frequency? That might be worth editing into he CC too.
And does the buy-in get you your first HH token? Maybe clarify that. I'll stat up a character in the coming days for your review, but I'm still not sure I'll be able to actually play. It depends on a lot of things irl.

You can have droids or a crew, as long as you have the creds for them
