# Dark Heresy

### **Tempeste** (2010-06-23 17:09:52)

I'm interested in running a game under this system, but perhaps not specifically a 'Dark Heresy' setting. There are other areas of the universe that I think the rules could translate well into. Attached a poll to see what concept would get the most interest, if you have any other ideas feel free to post them.
Dark Heresy Classic: This is the standard Dark heresy format. You're acolytes working for an Inquisitor battling the forces of chaos in a secret war.
Imperial Guard: To be a soldier in the Imperial Guard is to be a single doomed soul amongst billions. The Imperium's armies are vast but cumbersome.
Sub Concepts;
-Conscripts- None of you chose to join the Guard but instead had the decision made for you. Now you have to survive in a war against deadly foes where your own command doesn't even care where you live.
-Penal Legion- If a Crimindal commits a crime heinous enough to earn them the death penalty, they're sometimes given a single choice. Fight for the Emperor on the battlefield and attempt to earn back their freedom, or die.
Hive Primus: The shadowed underhive has it's own wars fought between rival gangs and the Enforcers who try to keep the peace. Fighting is brutal and only the cunning and lucky can survive the journey to bring their Gang to the top.

Could anyone who voted please vote again, it seems they were deleted when I added the 'Other' Option to the poll. Also, please post if you vote on the poll so I can get an idea of how many people are interested, thanks.
