# Kalium Chronicles - Fantasy based open world (always recruit

### **Alicia** (2013-06-16 21:59:38)

The goal is to open up a world, much like we sought to do with our Kalium project but hopefully this will be on a much more manageable scale. The world will be open for a range of RP, developed by the imaginations of the people who play it as the game progresses.
Based more off the free form rp, there won't be a set GM, instead each player will act in turn as a storyteller leading the troupe down a story line. Since each character should have their own dreams, goals and fears this should lead to some interesting encounters. Using another tool such as the [Mythic GM Emulator](http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/23055894/images/1360514412936.pdf "http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/23055894/images/1360514412936.pdf"), the world can be expanded that way as well.
We will be using [the Window](http://www.mimgames.com/window/ "http://www.mimgames.com/window/") which is an open gaming system focused on developing story.
Feel free to ask questions or offer ideas as the most minds we get involved the better it will be.
Information concerning the game and setting can be found on the [dedicated wiki](http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/ "http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/")

Tilike Tolfson
(Tie-Leak Tol-Son)
------------------------------
White Male, heavy tan
32 years old
5'8"
186 lbs
Stocky fellow with dark blonde hair, falling to his shoulders. Deep blue eyes look out at his surroundings, His face is accented by a chiseled jaw and angular features. Dresses in worn, but well kept, dark leather pants and jacket and a loose white shirt.
------------------------------
Growing up in a blacksmith's family in the geopolae of Natutik was hard work. He began working with his father (name) and uncle (name) learning the arts of crafting weapons and armor at the age of five. Over the years he learned the art of not only making but repairing the various forms of armor and weapons, but took to a fascination to edged weapons at and early age. When he was discovered trying to practice with a pair of custom curved blades at the age of ten by his uncle he was placed under the tutelage of a local sword master. He continued working at his family's shop during the day but practiced and studied the art of swordsmanship in the evenings for several years.
When he started becoming of age he discovered an interesting talent while practicing throwing his blades. After a bad throw his throwing dagger went extremely wide and he featured out of frustration at his target and the blade altered its direction. Surprised and confused he kept the incident secret and tried to replicate the experience over the next few months. As he began to understand his new ability he tried different approaches to using it. He found he was able to change the direction of whatever he threw, even reverse it's direction to hit a target from behind. At first it only applied to his various blades he had grown so accustomed too but eventually he discovered he could also pull small objects to his hands or push them from across the room.
At the age of19 he starting getting into brawls around the geopolae. His drive to fight was deep from within, a need to protect someone less fortunate. When he was 24 he was in a particularly bad brawl and heavily out numbered. Using his custom blades and his telekinetic ability he won the fight was discovered of having forbidden mystical powers. The townsfolk and his family quickly disowned him and he had to leave the city or risk a cleansing from the geopolae.
He traveled for many years from one geopolae to another and spent many a night in the wilds. He occasionally set up shop repairing or selling goods within his tradecraft but some of the best money he made for himself was when he worked for the local law freelance, hunting down local thugs and criminals. His stay would be short in each geopolae because once his ability was discovered he had to quickly move on to another geopolae.
During one of his trips between geopolae his ran into a Valkarie Caravan and after a brief discussion of their travels and abilities he decided to travel with them, providing his services as a skilled fighter and maintaining their gear. Finally finding acceptance of his abilities he found renewed purpose, fighting for equality between magical and non-magical beings.

Looks good to me. BW and I hadn't really discussed using luck and sanity as part of the inherent traits.
When I made mine I stuck with Strength, health, perception, agility and knowledge.
I'm not sure sanity or luck would be necessary unless he was unusually exceptional negatively or positively in either.
Just a thought. Like I said we hadn't discussed it.

I am thinking about making a character for this, but can't really decide on what concept I want to go with. If I make a pilot would it be fair to have him own his own mount, or would you want him to just be a pilot for hire?

### **Alicia** (2013-06-25 17:19:24)

Be could own a mount, but keep this in mind right now. Ryder and I have both made characters that would most likely start on the ground.
My plans for starting a thread involve ground travel right now but down the line we'd probably. Make lt to the aeropolae. Of course just because he's a pilot doesn't mean he's not curious about what happens on the ground. Just a thought for what I'm thinking.
Edit: just because my initial plans may not work for you right now doesn't mean you can't jump in later or make your own thread.
It's my hope that Kalium will spark many threads with their own adventures that will tie into an in depth world. The history of Kalium is essentially a blank slate with ideas for legends and nemesis right now.

The Information file was updated today. Mainly I reorganized it and added a table of contents.
Working on setting up a wiki to better organize future information, but right now using gdocs should be alright.
I've made a forum for the adventures here: <!-- l -->[viewforum.php?f=259](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=259 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=259")<!-- l -->

Zedicus Zulrand
------------------------------
White Male, light tan
26 years old
5'6"
145 lbs
A shorter slender fellow with short black hair, that is usually spiked, and a black goatee with red hair mixed in it. He has dark brown eyes that watch as events unfold around him. He dresses in a dark green long-sleeved shirt, with the sleeves rolled up, and black pants. He has a pair of darkened technicianâ€™s goggles resting on top of his hair.
------------------------------
He was born in Thascen to a family that was barely scraping by. As time went on his family gave birth to other children and he ended up being the oldest of four. He learned to care for his siblings and cook for them, though the ingredients he had were usually scarce, and while he watched them he took to reading any book he could get his hands on.
Both of his parents were skilled pilots ferrying people back and forth on their flying squirrel mounts. As he got older he found out that his parents were always scraping by because of the massive debt they got into with a loan shark in acquiring their two mounts. They tried to teach him how to fly so that they could pass on their trade to him when he became of age, but he found that he had more of a knack for messing with the pedal powered gliders and things that had moving gears and mechanisms.
When he finally came of age and had to go out looking for work he got a job working as a maintainer for Skyward Enterprises, one of the many travelling companies that were in Thascen. He still did what he could to keep up with his studies as he worked with the machines, and in time started trying to tinker and create new machines. He would spend hours reading and drawing in his little sketchbook he carried trying to come up with new machines that could assist with travel and daily life.
All seemed to be going well until one of his creations malfunctioned and killed one of the pilots that worked at Skyward Enterprises. He was fired and had to pay the manâ€™s family reimbursement for their loss. At that time he decided it was time for him to go out exploring and try to find new things out in the world, and hopefully he would be able to build bigger and better machines and redeem his name in the eyes of his peers and his family.
