# Drakensban: End Times

### **simplyscribed** (2010-09-04 08:07:02)

I'm trying not to get too caught up with the whole GMing thing these days, but I've promised to run an online game for some old tabletop buddies who I can no longer play with IRL. I have two players currently, with a third a possibility, so I have some slots free. Figured I may as well run the game here and advertise to fill the slots. The game will use a homebrew system that uses playing cards (I will be doing all draws).
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The campaign setting</span>
The cultures of the continent of Drakensban have developed isolated from the world, trapped between the deadly Wastes to the North and a magical barrier across the sea to the South - a barrier left by a master race who abandoned their servitors ages past. The continent was once the home of the Draken, monstrous flying beasts which ravaged civilisations, until they were banished as part of the same magical ritual that trapped Drakensban's people.
Drakensban is on the face of it a high magic setting with dark and deadly undertones. Following is a short list of some of the fantasy staples the setting offers:
**Magic:** When the Gesp travelled South, leaving their loyal servants behind, they left a miraculous gift. Those individuals gifted with a Lesser or Greater Spark may learn and practice the art of magic. Drakensban boasts traditional mages alongside graphomancers who prepare disposable spell triggers in advance. The Church has servitors known as Blessed, who differ from mages only in the way they ritualise their magic and the manner in which they Sparked. Haemomancy, or Blood Magic, is practiced by unsavoury cults and sadistic mages. Even martial artists and the legendary Waste Rangers practice a form of magic, taking advantage of their inner Spark (often unknowingly) to access inhuman abilities.
**Adventure:** To the North lie the Wastes and further even than they the Ice Wastes. Surrounding are mountains and underneath are countless unknown underground lairs. The brave, the foolhardy, and those with a death wish have no shortage of places to explore and find adventure. Great treasures and historical secrets may lie in ruins that predate even the first landing of the settlers.
**Intrigue:** There are seven nations on the continent of Drakensban, each with its own political agenda. In the courts of each nation the Elite vie for supremacy. The State withholds power from the Church, and the Church undermines the State. Powerful Mages and great warriors work for the benefit of their preferred benefactors or pursue their own goals, often acting above the laws of the lands.
**Mystery:** What is the truth behind the Gesps' abandonment of Drakensban? Where did the Draken come from and how were they banished? Why is the Waste full of monsters, and who built the ancient ruins within it? Is there truly no way to leave Drakensban? These questions and more await the would-be citizen, and may or may not be answered during the course of the campaign.

I´ve always favored Fantasy settings, and this one sounds extremely interesting, so if you need more players you can probably count me in.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-09-12 09:02:46)

I´ll be getting to work on this once I read up a bit. I have a few questions though.

* Why is the Katana considered a "Finesse" weapon? This is just primarily a question of curiosity, since the idea is completely foreign to me, and I would have figured "Heavy" as a better place to put it. Not to mention that this would hint that fighting with a Rapier is similar to wielding a Katana, which I find odd.
* As far as I can tell, you only have to take the appropriate powers in order to wield magic, right?
* I find the section "Purchasing Equipment" to be notably empty, so are we just supposed to list what possession we reasonably carries with us, or are you planning to lay down some rules for that?
* I´m not really sure on duration for spells, what does "inst/1 round" mean. When applied to the Combat Magick power I find it self-explanatory, but for those spells with only one effect, not so much.

> Why is the Katana considered a &quot;Finesse&quot; weapon? This is just primarily a question of curiosity, since the idea is completely foreign to me, and I would have figured &quot;Heavy&quot; as a better place to put it. Not to mention that this would hint that fighting with a Rapier is similar to wielding a Katana, which I find odd.

While I am not trained in the use of swords, I have friends that practice with broadswords, and they tell me that real fights are hardly the graceful displays of tv and film, and a sword is actually wielded like a club or axe - it doesn't even particularly matter if the sword is sharp, as it is the force of the attack that matters. My friends who fight with katanas, on the other hand, explain their style as having more to do with artful precision. Thus, I grouped it under "finesse" - it isn't that wielding a katana is similar to wielding a rapier, it is more to do with a similar mentality behind each style.
I welcome a reasoned argument against this if you have one, however.
EDIT: It is true that a fencer, in real life, should not be able to pick up a katana and wield it with equal skill. Should the system account for that? Not really, in the same way it doesn't account for the differences between a bow and a thrown dagger. It is a general system with broad categories. Recognition of the boundaries of logic are in the hands of the player: be true to concept. If your character wields a rapier, and realistically has no knowledge of trying to fight with a katana, just don't be tempted to pick up a katana. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
If it becomes necessary to introduce a system of proficiencies I will do so, but I hope it won't be necessary as I'm trying to design with elegance in mind rather than obfuscating everything with crunch layer upon crunch layer.
> As far as I can tell, you only have to take the appropriate powers in order to wield magic, right?

Technically you don't even need Powers. Possessing ranks in the magic discipline's Role allows you to do cantrips and miscellaneous minor utility spells. You may even be able to find minor combat applications for such powers if creative. You need the Powers to access more powerful magics, particularly those of most use in combat scenarios.
I have plans to use a system of descriptors for detailing a power's element/energy/type, similar to that used in M&M. Until I implement it however mage characters should simply have a broad theme that their magic use will honour within the game: "elemental", "divine", "combat", and so on.
For this setting I will use the following Magic sub-Roles: True (this is the art of performing "spur of the moment" magic), Creation (this is the art of making items, including the spell triggers favoured by Graphomancers), and Ritual (this is the art of performing miscellaneous powerful and time-consuming rites: bindings, summonings, area wardings, and so on).
> I find the section &quot;Purchasing Equipment&quot; to be notably empty, so are we just supposed to list what possession we reasonably carries with us, or are you planning to lay down some rules for that?

I'm not sure I want the system to focus too much on the precise value of a character's equipment. For now, at any rate, you may possess any non-Master Craft item that fits with your character's concept. I will review the lists to see if I agree with their suitability, and in certain cases may upgrade an item to Superior status.
> I´m not really sure on duration for spells, what does &quot;inst/1 round&quot; mean. When applied to the Combat Magick power I find it self-explanatory, but for those spells with only one effect, not so much.

Because the game uses a generic spell system it doesn't focus too much on the fine-tuning of a spell. Rather, it just provides limits within which the caster's player can work. You don't have to cast a spell out to your maximum range, for example. Indeed it is often better not to push to the limits of your caps, as casting a weaker spell than you are capable of will be beneficial when testing for Energy drain (this is a system I'm still working on, but I will have a version in place ready for playtesting before game start).
Depending on the type of spell, duration can mean one of two different things: for a protective or buffing spell it describes the amount of time the effect lasts. For instantaneous type powers such as damaging spells, you will usually not even need a duration, but you could choose to cast a triggered spell which will take place when a certain condition is met. If the duration passes before the spell is triggered, it expires.
"Inst/1 round" means that depending on how you describe the spell and what you want it to do it's effects either happen straight away or at any time in the future provided it occurs before your turn in the next round. For example, rather than cure an ally after he is wounded, you might decide to take pre-emptive action and cast a spell that triggers if they are wounded in the next combat round.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-09-12 12:15:01)

The answers to some of my questions above touch on an important fact that I should probably make very clear:
I want to playtest Dragane now because I believe I have enough of the system in place to make it feasible, and that the questions arising now and issues coming up in play will help direct the game's development by inspiring solutions organically. However, it must be acknowledged that both the system and it's documentation are far from complete plus any or all of it may be subject to later change.
In short: don't get too attached to character builds, as the way your chosen character options fit into the system may inevitably be altered.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-09-12 13:25:27)

While I haven´t practiced actual Kendo, I have practiced with the katana in other arts, and I´m not sure I´d say "artful precision" to be the best term for describing it. "Fluid motions" would be my pick for a summarizing phrase. In my experience, it is not so much as making a precise cut that matters, but maneuvering yourself to the position where such a cut is possible. This is very subjective though, but since you use the "Grace" attribute for basic melee attacks, it seems more appropriate.
Pretty much all other RPG systems I´ve seen usually notes the katana as a desgin variant of the bastard sword, and they´ve hopefully had some people thinking about it. This actually makes a lot of sense to me, since using a katana one-handed is not something I would recommend. Granted, I´ve been using wooden training swords, but it doesn´t take long before you get tired of parrying attacks if you hold it one-handed. Plus you barely gets enough force to deflect an attack from someone wielding his sword two-handed. I think a general rule in medieval fencing is "if you aren´t using it in two hands, bring a shield".
Just my two cents

> **DarthAnthrax wrote:**

Well regardless of what happens to the katana in the long term, I should comment that it isn't really an appropriate weapon choice for this particular setting anyway. There are no "Oriental" cultures on the continent of Drakensban.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-09-12 13:53:31)

Ah, that settles it then. I was deciding between a graceful katana fighter and a little more "sturdy" swordsman.

Hi, I'm one of the other players for this.
The argument of katana vs. masterwork bastard sword is one I can get into all day long. Suffice to say when the bastard sword was created it was to deal with heavier armour than the katana. But that's all nitpicking and I shouldn't have started myself.
Anyways, I'm planning on playing a typical Brawn/fortune fighter as an archetype. But, yeh; not sure what else to say except that
Also, Hi to the community.

I never liked the katana = bastard sword argument myself. They're clearly very different weapons, and the decision to make them so mechanically in d20 games seems every bit as arbitrary as my choice to make it a finesse weapon.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-09-16 12:54:58)

I haven't had any kind of response back from my two other players yet. Either they've lost interest or they've gotten busy, and in either case the playtest must go on!
Once I've received characters from everyone and checked them over, I'll begin the game without them and they can always join in later. So the sooner you post a sheet, the sooner things can begin.

Just a note to say Anazider and Magic have tentatively promised me their characters by the end of the week, so depending on DA's timetable the game may be able to start Monday.

A few extra powers for you to consider for your builds. Which reminds me, admittedly a bit late in the day - although I'm keen on playtesting what I have, if there is something you absolutely *need* for your build and you don't think there's currently a character option that adequately reflects it, let me know and I'll consider developing something.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Cleaving Assault [Combat]</span>
**PREREQUISITES:** for use with two-handed weapons; Brawn 3, Grace 2
You swing your weapon with power and control, striking at multiple opponents where a lesser warrior might target one.
**BENEFIT:** you may target one additional foe with your melee attack, who must be within your reach. The damage draw of a Cleaving Assault attack against any foe is reduced by a cumulative ♠ -1 per each additional opponent targeted.
**IMPROVE ×2:** cumulative additional foe.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Dancing Blades [Combat]</span>
**PREREQUISITES:** for use with one-handed weapons; Grace 3, Fleetness 2
You have adopted a graceful, spinning style, focusing on light strikes on the foes swarming around you rather than risking heavy killing blows against just one.
**BENEFIT:** you may target one additional foe with your melee attack, who must be within your reach. The damage draw of a Dancing Blades attack against any foe is reduced by a cumulative ♠ -1 per each additional opponent targeted.
**IMPROVE ×2:** cumulative additional foe.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Greater Cleaving Assault [Combat]</span>
**PREREQUISITES:** Cleave; Brawn 4, Grace 3
Your mighty swings stop for nothing.
**BENEFIT:** reduce the damage draw penalty of any Cleaving Assault attack you make by ♠ 1.

**PREREQUISITES:** Dancing Blades; Grace 4, Fleetness 3
You are a dazzling dervish.
**BENEFIT:** reduce the damage draw penalty of any Dancing Blades attack you make by ♠ 1.
**IMPROVE ×2:** cumulative ♠ 1 penalty reduction.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Greater Rapid Fire [Combat]</span>
**PREREQUISITES:** Rapid Fire; Adroitness 4, Wit 3
Your lightning reactions and blistering draw speed work in perfect concert.
**BENEFIT:** reduce the damage draw penalty of any Rapid Fire attack you make by ♠ 1.
**IMPROVE ×2:** cumulative ♠ 1 penalty reduction.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Rapid Fire [Combat]</span>
**PREREQUISITES:** Adroitness 3, Wit 2
You can fire your weapon quickly and with relative precision, but you sacrifice some of your deadly accuracy with each extra missile loosed against an enemy.
**BENEFIT:** you may target one additional foe with your ranged attack, who must be within your weapon's range. The damage draw of a Rapid Fire attack against any foe is reduced by a cumulative ♠ -1 per each additional opponent targeted.
**IMPROVE ×2:** cumulative additional foe.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Sharpshooter [Combat]</span>
**PREREQUISITES:** Adroitness 4
If your enemy has a weak spot, you'll find it. And you'll almost always hit it.
**BENEFIT:** ♠ +1 on any ranged damage rolls.
**IMPROVE ×2:** cumulative ♠ +1 per additional rank of Power.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-09-19 13:34:15)

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Pack Leader [Combat]</span>
**PREREQUISITES:** Presence 3
People instinctively take their cues from you during combat.
**BENEFIT:** one ally who flanks an opponent you are also engaged with gains a +1 to their attack results against the flanked opponent.
**IMPROVE ×2:** cumulative additional flanking ally.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">So Pretty [Social]</span>
**PREREQUISITES:** Brawn 3, Grace 3, Presence 3
Someone as beautiful as you shouldn't be capable of ugliness.
**BENEFIT:** when they first meet you, and provided they have no cause to immediately hate or feel threatened by you, Supporting Cast likely to be attracted to you are predisposed to like you. They are treated as though their attitude to you is one step improved from normal. This power has no effect after the first meeting: only your actions can dictate whether their attitude remains the same, improves, or worsens.
**IMPROVE ×2:** Supporting Cast attitudes improve by an additional step.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">So Pretty and Witty [Social]</span>
**PREREQUISITES:** So Pretty; Brawn 3, Grace 3, Presence 3
Why demonstrate tact now, when you can hint at tactile later?
**BENEFIT:** Supporting Cast who are likely to be attracted to you will forgive almost any social blunder if they think it will get them anywhere with you. Against such targets, you can use your Brawn or your Grace in place of Carouser and Diplomacy.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">&#8230; and Gay [Social]</span>
**PREREQUISITES:** So Pretty; So Pretty and Witty; Brawn 4, Grace 4, Presence 4
You are as near-perfect as a mortal can be and stir up feelings in men and women; even those who think themselves immune to such as you are only fooling themselves.
**BENEFIT:** The benefits of both prerequisite powers now work against all Supporting Cast.

One thing I´ve been thinking about
Some ability to stun/weaken/generally mess with people in battle without the use of magic. Examples such as bashing a sword hit in their face, kicking them in the groin, stomping their toes, or otherwise affect their performance. "Dirty Tricks", some might call it...

Yep, combat powers that duplicate (to a lesser degree) some of the things magic powers do are on my to-do list.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-09-20 01:30:12)

Hmm, two more things, then I should be able to have this ready in no time.
What options does there exist for increasing Attributes/Sub-Attributes after initial character creation? I´ve noticed the Untapped Talent power, though that seems only able to affect 2/3 of the Sub-Attributes for each attribute, and only be able to raise them by 1 each. My main issue is really how much I have to plan ahead with my Attributes. Do I need to make sure I qualify for every possible power I might want to have from scratch, or could it suffice to have a Learnedness 2 from scratch even if I eventually might want to take the Archmage power?
Second thing is just a clarification on power improvements. If it says "Improvement(x2)", does that mean I have to take the power 2 or 3 times to get the benefit?

**Flaws** Unfortunate, Enemies
Special: -2 from armor and shield (medium).
**Description** At 6'3" tall and weighing in at 250 lbs, Severn Brailon is an imposing figure. His head is bald, which he maintains religiously, and he keeps a short dark brown goatee and mustache. His heavily muscled right arm and chest are bare, and show many scars and some tattoos. His left arm and side are encased in boiled leather and plate, the former a stained dark brown and the latter a dull grey from exposure. Round his waist hangs a belt with many small pouches, and his legs are covered in the same leather and plate as his left side. In his thickly gauntleted left hand he carries a large shield of wood and more of the thick iron that adorns his armor. In his bare right hand he hefts an axe that most would require both hands to wield. His eyes are a dull smoky grey, very close to the same shade as the steel he wears. His brow is craggy, with thick brown eyebrows. His cheek-bones are high and sharp, his nose crooked from multiple breaks. One ear is badly mangled from some battle long past. Clasp at each shoulder is a thick brown cloak, who's hood comes forward only during poor weather. On his forehead lies a symbol, part scar, part tattoo, of a circle and a crescent. Despite his brutish appearance, the most frightening thing about the man is the intelligence and determination in eyes.
**Background** Severn Brailon knows little of his origins and less of his parentage. He was raised by a witch who travelled the lands, and under her care (or lack thereof) he learned perseverance and strength, and to hate and fear the Church. Unbeknownst to him, the witch was a vile Blood practitioner, wanted by governments and the Church alike.
According to the Blood Witch, Arika, Severn is heir to the throne of Bryun, a land he's never seen to his knowledge. She claimed to have saved him from his parents' (her liege lord and lady) attackers, vile men from both the Church and other noble houses of Bryun. She told him many grand tales of court life and his parents, who were both good and noble rulers. "Good" and "Noble" were not the words she used, though. She used words like "Weak" and "Foolish," Severn learned as he grew that her definition of morals was severely flawed.
As they travelled he learned from every culture they encountered. In Argonn he learned of armor, and in its twin Glasrayn, he learned of combat. In Hastin, he learned to speak with dignity and diplomacy. In Quam, he learned to survive the wilderness with little but his own hands. In Teoma, he was freed of the witch's influence, and learned a great deal of magic.
At seventeen years old in Teoma, the witch met her maker. After helping her prepare for a ritual he was unfamiliar with, their enemies caught up to them. In the battle that followed, the witch disappeared, and could not be found after Severn slew the last of the attackers. He left and wandered Teoma and the wastes, eventually finding a home amongst a group of mage warriors who taught him much of power of the sun and passion of the moon. After describing the witch's ritual to his teacher he learned the witch had planned to kill him. His teacher informed him that the ritual was meant to steal the Spark of another person. The witch had often told him he had enormous untapped potential, and had often remarked upon his scarred forehead as being a symbol of his greatness. Learning this cemented his suspicions of the woman's character, and made him glad of her apparent death. He didn't know what of her tales were lies and what were truths, but he believed in his strength, and his will. After having his teacher darken a portion of his scar so that it would more obviously resemble a sun overlaid with a crescent he took his leave of his newest and only family.
Since then he has wandered the lands, learning and trying to discover the truth to his origins, a task made difficult due to the constant hounding by his still unknown enemies. They may be of the Church, of the witch's former brethren, or a combination of the two. As far as he knows, they may even be agents of the disloyal houses of Bryun. This has kept him from Bryun and Pelsyt, the witch's homeland. He doesn't care if what the witch told him was true; he aims to be a king one day. In every land he's seen he has seen few leaders he felt deserved the title, and believes without doubt that he can lead and rule to his peoples' benefit. He also believes the Church should be abolished, having seen signs of its influence and corruption everywhere as well as being hunted by them.

Here´s my character. Hope you don´t mind the pdf, I´ll try to get it in board format as soon as I get the picture straight. This is subject to change pending simply´s answers to my questions, though background, personality, and concept will remain the same, though actual traits might vary a bit.

I´ve noticed the Untapped Talent power, though that seems only able to affect 2/3 of the Sub-Attributes for each attribute, and only be able to raise them by 1 each. My main issue is really how much I have to plan ahead with my Attributes. Do I need to make sure I qualify for every possible power I might want to have from scratch, or could it suffice to have a Learnedness 2 from scratch even if I eventually might want to take the Archmage power?
> Second thing is just a clarification on power improvements. If it says &quot;Improvement(x2)&quot;, does that mean I have to take the power 2 or 3 times to get the benefit?

You've misunderstood Untapped Talent a wee bit, and my reply to your second question should explain why: in Dragane, the powers you pick grow with you, at least until a certain point. If a power has an Improve option, it advances in utility each time you qualify for a new power, and the amount of times it improves is determined by the given multiplier. This occurs in addition to your purchase of a new power, so you could realistically have 2, 3, or more "levelling" benefits each time you accrue 6 experience points. Improve x2 means the power can improve twice, so in the instance of Untapped Talent you gain 2 additional sub-attribute increases by the time the power has finished it's evolution.
Untapped Talent is also one of the few powers you may select multiple times (most would be redundant as they grant draw and result modifiers, which overlap rather than stack), making it the game's built-in route for Attribute advancement.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-09-21 19:12:11)

Okay, that clears up a bit, and will probably warrant a restructuring of my character. But when you say I can take Untapped Talent multiple times, do you mena that I can take it multiple time for different attributes, or can I take it multiple times for the same attribute? Because if it is the former, then my initial concern still stands, that I can ever only increase each sub-Attribute by 1. Which means that if I, for example, want to take the Archmage power, I will need to start out with a Learnedness of 4, since I can only increase it by 1 as my character progresses.
I´m not putting any value into if I think this is good or bad, but when creating a character it can be interesting to know. It also seems to me like it would make character progression really intense and impressive when gaining your first 12-18 XP, but then it would be pretty much nonexisting.

Just to let you guys know, I'm currently without internet access at my flat. This means I can only log on for hour-long periods at a time at the library or go to internet cafes (if I want to pay). This means I have limited time windows for my job search, checking emails, reading posts, and posting. I also have to C&P a lot of stuff to my flash drive and deal with it at home so I have time to get everything done.
In addition, I'm currently hosting my girlfriend for a few days as she temporarily has nowhere else to go, so I'm spending a lot of time I would otherwise be dedicating to things like this playing host.
Net result: this game WILL start, but not for a few more days while I sort out my backlog and gather the materials I need. Since I'm going to Poland next Thursday through Sunday for a wedding, it might be best for me to wait until the Monday after before initiating proceedings in any case.

### **Magical2099** (2010-10-05 20:21:17)

gonna have to second the Graphomancer question here double S.
Near as I can tell Val, the powers related to magic allow its use in combat with little to no preparation. Otherwise the spells have to be set up ahead of time. I believe this is what Graphomancy is (setting up ahead of time) but I don't know how that works in a game mechanic way. And I think the different magics are just flavors, but I could be wrong.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-10-05 20:35:12)

As I get it, Graphomancers are special in the way that they craft small "triggers" where they store their magic energy, like small scrolls, slabs of clay, or similar things. The benefit of this would be that you don´t need to expend energy when using a spell stored in such a trigger, and suffers no chance of failing.
As for magic use not among the powers, I figures it will just work like any other skill draw, using some base stat + appropriate magic role. So for example, if I want to light a fire using magic, I´ll draw (appropriate stat) + (Mage(Sol) role) and check against some set value, probably a low one, goven the simple task. At least that´s how I get it.
For the magic found among powers, you can read "can be described as you see fit", so in this case the different magic roles would work as descriptors.
I hope I got it right anyway <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

Right I understand they make triggers, I just don't see how that works in game mechanics. The Graphomancer description mentions things like energy loss and spell failure but there's no explanation of such things in the rules.

Well OK I suppose that makes sense for the small things, but honestly I'm not too concerned with how one starts their campfire in this setting. I'm more interested in using magic to enhance my physical abilities, i.e. stronger, faster, leaping across greater than normal distances, etc. Is that possible in this setting?

No, but from what I can read it seems like using magic will use your Energy (see Temporary Energy Loss), and using triggers seems like it can allow you to cast spells that automatically succeed. Spell failure I would just suppose is failing your draw.

I suppose the "Buffing Magick" power could be used or that since it doesn´t really say what draws it´s buffing. But otherwise I think it´s like much of Simply´s work, very generic. If you say "I want to use magic to leap 10 meters high", you´ll probably make an appropriate draw.

---

### **Valheru** (2010-10-05 21:42:52)

Hmm, I thought the Buffing Magick power was to help others not yourself, but I guess it depends on if you are considered your own ally or not. A bigger issue I suppose is that the powers only last one round, at least by my understanding. There's not much mention of what all you can do in a single round but I guess I'm assuming you can't do much more than move in the same round you cast. That's purely based on d20 and several other systems I've played though. Perhaps there's multi-action rules like in Torg or Savage Worlds?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-10-05 21:47:51)

Well I´m just guessing here, and I would put more money on my second explanation. But I´m sure Simply will lear all this up.

DA is basically right.
I'm not surprised there is a lot of confusion on this point, since Magic is among the least developed sections. This is compounded, perhaps, by the fact you guys have an older version of the D3. I must have forgotten to upload the newest version, which would have helped clear up some questions about Magic. My bad.
Firstly, I'll reproduce those sections, then I'll do my best to clear up any other questions up point by point.
**MAGIC**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Magic Roles
As with any other Role, the Magic sub-Roles (which may vary from setting to setting) determine the character’s actual capability in a single magical discipline. Simply possessing the Role grants the character the ability to cast cantrips and minor utility spells: light a small fire, generate a pint’s worth of drinking water, clean the dirt off your clothes, and so on. These spells generally have no discernable game effect.
Sometimes (though only rarely) these minor spells can be used in creative ways which may result in the GM rewarding you with small circumstantial modifiers if you can match a set DN (sort of like an improvised power).
Magic Powers
To cast powerful magic, particularly those spells useful in combat, you must possess one or more magic Powers. The Powers you select determine what spell effects you may create, and the upper limits of your capabilities (known as “caps”). You can cast spells at their maximum potential or deliberately choose to cast a less powerful spell.
**TARGETS:** the maximum amount of creatures or objects you may affect with a single spell of this type. Unless you cast a spell with an improved area, targets must be adjacent to each other (and all must be within the spell’s range).
**RANGE:** the maximum distance at which you can affect a target with a spell of this type.
**DURATION:** the maximum amount of time the spell can remain in effect from the time of its casting. Duration is only usually applicable for buffing, debilitating, and warding spells. However, spells may be cast but not activated, the caster defining a triggering event or action. The spell lasts to the extent of its duration and if not triggered by then dissipates.
**INST/1 ROUND:** depending on how you describe the spell and what you want it to do its effects either happen straight away or at any time in the future, provided it occurs by the end of your turn in the next round. For example, rather than cure an ally after he is wounded, you might decide to take pre-emptive action and cast a spell that triggers if they are wounded between the time of casting and the end of your next turn.
**SPELL DAMAGE:** if the spell deals damage, this is the draw value.
**GRANT:** if the spell is intended to improve the abilities of a target, this is the amount of bonus cards applied to their draws.
**AFFLICT:** if the spell is intended to diminish the abilities of a target, this is the amount by which their draw is reduced.
**DEFENCE:** if the spell is intended to improve the target’s Ward, this is the amount of bonus cards applied to their draws.
**AREA:** An area spell affects a circle with a maximum diameter defined by this cap, the point at which you place the spell at its centre. The spell may still only affect a number of creatures or objects defined by the Target cap, but they may be anywhere in the area, rather than adjacent to all other targets.
Descriptors
When you cast a spell you apply one or more descriptors you know to establish the type of magic. For example, the “Fire” descriptor, applied to damaging Combat Magic, results in a fireball or bolt of heat. Descriptors can be anything and are largely for thematic purposes. However, in some settings monsters may possess weaknesses or resistances to certain descriptor types.
At character creation you may choose one descriptor per rank you possess in any Magic Role. The descriptors available to you can be any that are thematically appropriate to at least one of your Roles.
Other descriptors may be gained in play at your GM’s discretion (you could study under a new master, learn forgotten techniques from a grimoire, or be granted sudden insight by a higher power or ancient and mysterious item).
Energy Drain
Casting magic can take an exhausting toll on the mage’s spirit. In any encounter, you may cast a number of spells equal to your Willpower rank without problems (cantrips do not count toward this total). Any spells cast after this point may drain your Energy temporarily, and the more powerful the spell, the higher the chance!
Draw a number of cards equal to your current Energy Level. The GM draws a number of cards equal to the total draw value of all the spell’s effect caps (afflict, damage, defence, and grant). The GM adds further cards for every increment by which you have improved one of the spell’s other caps (targets, range, duration, and area).
*For example, if you were to cast a spell that damaged a target with a draw of ♠ 4 that simultaneous afflicted them for ♠ -2, the GM would draw 6 cards. If you improved the spell’s range by 60 feet (12 spaces) using Enhance Range, the GM would draw 8 cards.
If the GM’s high card is equal to or greater than your high card, you lose a temporary Energy level. If the GM beats you by drawing a joker or their high card exceeds your own by 4 the lost Energy level isn’t temporary!*

</details>

* Magic in Dragane is rather like superpowers in Mutants and Masterminds: the powers themselves are generic, and owe their flavour to descriptors.
* Currently, the only powers available are the ones in the document and those I've presented earlier in this very thread. Which is not to say there won't be more later on, as the system is still in development. This playtest is to see how well certain aspects of the game work/slot together at an early stage of development, so I can avoid hours more work to "finish" the system then discover it never worked at all (this is also the reason several sections, including Magic, may currently seem woefully inadequate).
* Regarding Graphomancy, there are actually two ways to implement new Magic types in Dragane. Then can be added as Roles (for example, we could replace the current "elemental" Roles with True Mage, Item Creation, Ritual Mage, and Graphomancer roles), or they can be added as descriptors that interact with existing Roles (if we add the Creation and Trigger descriptors, you would need these descriptors to create permanent items and triggers respectively using your spells). I had opted to go with the latter option this time round on the basis that it requires less tweaking from the system core rules, but we can adopt the other approach if everyone would prefer it.

Is it possible to enhance one's own physical abilities? Yes. You may treat yourself as an ally when using Buffing Magick. Also, see the Insight Magick power presented below:
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Insight Magick [Mental]</span>
**PREREQUISITES:** Sagacity 3; any Magick 2
You are capable of casting insight-enhancing spells using any Magick Role you are proficient with. This power grants the ability to use your magick to grant allies bonuses to their draw results, and can be described as you see fit. The spell has the following maximum parameters:
**targets** 1; **range** 30 (6); **duration** inst/1 round; **grant** +1 to draw result
**IMPROVE ×2:** cumulative grant +1 to draw result per additional rank of Sagacity

Right. The advantage of creating triggers is you do all the work and take all the risks up front, so that by the time it comes around to combat you simply have triggers that work without risk. A True Mage isn't restricted in their use of powers at all but risks Energy Drain every time they cast.

That&#39;s purely based on d20 and several other systems I&#39;ve played though. Perhaps there&#39;s multi-action rules like in Torg or Savage Worlds?

To get your powers to last longer, invest in the Extend Duration power.
As for how much you can do in a round, you have 3 Activations. Activations are spent on anything from attacking, drawing or manipulating items, moving, and speech too extended to be considered a free action. You can spend these Activations on basically anything, with the following limitations: under normal circumstances only one can be spent to make an attack or use a combat power, and unless you all-out move only two per round can be spent on a move action.

### **Valheru** (2010-10-06 16:46:42)

Alright, so by combat power do you mean an attack spell, or any spell other than a cantrip? For example can I use Buffing Magick and throw a punch in the same round? Or would I have to Buff on round one and have it trigger on my attack in round two?

If a power grants a Combat Surge and requires activation (as is the case with all spell powers, save for those that enhance your existing abilities) it is considered an attack-equivalent activation. I will probably build a power/powers that let you double-up on such activations, but they would have high prerequisites. So yes, for current intents and purposes the latter of your two examples is correct.
A power with extended duration only requires activation once, though, so you would be able to make a buffed attack each turn thereafter rather than a on-off-on-off buff/attack dynamic.
You may also extend a power beyond it's normal duration by spending an activation in the turn which it would normally expire. This method does not require the Extend Duration power, but has several drawbacks:

* You have to spend an activation. On the bright side, this activation is NOT attack equivalent, because it requires less concentration to maintain a spell than it does to cast it in the first place.
* Extending a spell in this manner counts as a new spell with regard to Energy Drain.
* The GM draws an additional card against you to determine any effects of Energy Drain (with cumulative draw increase of +1 per additional turn extended in this manner).

### **Valheru** (2010-10-06 18:58:03)

OK thanks that helps a lot. I have one more question, for now. :P
The sections on challenges and wards mention that attacking is a challenge while the section on attacks declares it is a contest. Plus wards are marked with a ♠ which would imply drawing cards. So which is it, a challenge or a contest?

These sections have undergone quite a few changes as my initial ideas for the game mechanics shifted back and forth, and I still haven't managed to edit out all the inconsistencies. Firstly attacks were a challenge against a static defence number, then I introduced the idea of passive contests and they became one of those... Right now, **combat is considered a contested draw between Attack and Ward.** But if this proves too clunky in play we will probably return to a passive contest approach.

No worries, I understand it's a work in progress. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
OK, I'm not finished with the background but here's what I've got so far. I need to hit the road but I wanted you to see where I'm going with the character.

**Flaws** Wanted
**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Korlan Velara was raised on the mean streets of Bryun. The orphaned Korlan fell in with a gang of similarly dispossessed children so early in his life he doesn't remember anything before it. They resorted to begging, shoplifting, pick pocketing, and, when desperate enough, even mugging just to survive. Mortality rates are exceedingly high among street urchins and Korlan might not have survived had it not been for Bram Dreyden. Bram Dreyden was a wetboy, a magically talented assassin, and one of the most infamous men in the country. The two met by random happenstance, or perhaps fate if one believes in that sort of thing. Bram recognized the strong Spark within Korlan and offered to take him on as his apprentice. Elated, the astonished Korlan accepted.
Life as Master Dreyden's apprentice was anything but easy. Korlan underwent physical training until his body collapsed from exhaustion, then studied anatomy, poisons, and other tools of the trade until his mind turned to mush.

</details>

I'm worried I may have spread the character too thin but I guess we'll see. Hopefully the Buffing Magick will help with that. I believe everything is in order but I did make some last minute changes when I realized he didn't qualify for Extended Duration. Let me know if I missed anything.
The idea behind Wanted is that he's performed several assassinations in the politically volatile nation of Bryun. Thus he is wanted by multiple factions. Some want him dead, either for justice or revenge, but many more would rather acquire him for his services. He's somewhat picky on the contracts he takes so some would like to capture him and "make him an offer he can't refuse". Of course not many people have seen his face and he uses a variety of alternate identities and disguises so tracking him down is not so easy. If you feel that's worth two flaws than great, but if not I'll add in another.

The game starts soon. Probably tomorrow (it would be nice to start on a Monday like I originally stated, even if it is several weeks late.
Please post characters to the Hall and Heroes as and when you can.
Valheru, I think your Wanted only counts for one flaw - you'll need another.
