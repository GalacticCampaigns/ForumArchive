# The Kessel Run and other Spacer tall tales

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-27 04:20:08)

Legacy Era
* 32 point buy for stats (does not include racial changes)
* Max HP for level
* Build up to level 8
* credits Starting Money for non wealth characters
Noble 18800 Cash 18800 Resources
Jedi 15200 Cash 15200 Resources
Scoundrel/Scout/Soldier 17000 Cash 17000 Resources
Characters with wealth get it RaW but no extra money or resources
if you take wealth at 1st level you get 180k
* Resources: Throughout a character's life, they develop access to several resources in the form of non-liquid wealth, contacts in all walks of life, and favors owed. You will have available to you an amount of credits equal to your total credit amount. This can be used for a ship and upgrades as well as contacts or favors. Any questions, comments, and/or concerns over this system, please don't hesitate to contact me.
* Use any and all books and supplements available, although I ask when writing out the stat block you make a list somewhere of where the non-core references are coming from. This includes equipment.
* Race selection is Era specific. Make sure to look in the Wookiepedia to see if they were actually around during this time. If I see they aren't then the character will be denied.
* Detailed, well written background and description required.
Also I want to run a fast paced game so I would like 1 post/2 days. I'm not expecting Shakespeare but I do want well thought out posts something beyond 1-2 lines. Thanks to Anazider who I stole the creation rules off of
I do reserve the right to change these rules

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-27 19:29:14)

I have a question about Wealth. How will it be used when we level up again, for example to level 9, will it work as normal? Just checking, since that level-based system is already extremely unfavorable for those who takes Wealth. For comparison, using normal rules I can have ~110k Credits at level 8 with the majority of levels being non-Noble, with this system I get 37,6k...
Unfair as h*ll if you ask me, and it becomes particularly annoying if we are supposed to try and factor in buying and upgrading a ship into it.

---

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-28 02:37:25)

I think I agree. If you have the wealth talent you get it as RaW. Also I will change the resource rule from
> You will have available to you an amount of credits equal to your starting credit amount

to equal to your total credit amount. Characters with wealth do not get additional resources. Sorry it is unfair I know <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
So Starting Money for non wealth characters
Noble 18800 Cash 18800 Resources

Scoundrel/Scout/Soldier 17000 Cash 17000 Resources

### **Valheru** (2010-08-28 16:53:10)

Dang that's a lotta money! I wasn't planning on taking wealth but now I might reconsider. :P
Have you decided what we'll be doing in the campaign? i.e. smugglers, pirates, ninjas?
Also, are you OK with Clawdites? Depending on the style of campaign it may or may not be that useful but I'd like to try it out.

### **Frost** (2010-08-28 19:04:29)

I think we are going with smugglers? I do wanna be a pirate ninja though.
Pirate ninja #1 What happened to your eye?
Pirate ninja #2 Shuriken accident don't ask Arrrr

Actually, Wealth is based on your Class Level. That is, levels in classes that grants access to it (Only Noble and Crime Lord, IIRC). For example, if I take wealth at level 1, and then take 4 more levels of Noble and then levels in something else, I would start with 4800 (Noble Starting Credits) + 5000(Wealth bonus at level 1) + 10000(Wealth bonus at level 2) + 15000(Wealth bonus at level 3) + 100000(Wealth bonus at levels 4-8) = 124800.
If I instead took only two levels of Noble, I´d get 4800 + 5000 + 70000 = 79800.
So only characters who takes Wealth at level 8 **and** takes 8 levels of Noble/Crimelord would get the 180k.

### **Frost** (2010-08-29 13:31:56)

Actually according to official errata it is
p. 44 – Wealth Talent
Change reference to "your noble level" to "your class level"

### **Frost** (2010-08-29 14:23:21)

> That is, levels in classes that grants access to it

where did you get that part? That wasn't in the errata

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-29 14:29:57)

As far as I know, that´s the definition of class level. For example, "Scoundrel class level" was removed from the Hyperdriven talent. I don´t know if it actually says so anywhere, but I do recall reading it on the Wizards forum somewhere a long time ago. I think that time the discussion was about the Dark Healing talent, and whether Sith Apprentice and Sith Lord levels stacked for the purpose of using that talent, and the answer was generalized to cover all similar instances.

---

### **Frost** (2010-08-29 14:36:45)

Ok I think your right
p. 36 – Class Level vs. Character Level Sidebar
Add the following sentence to the end of the sidebar: “If a talent refers to your class level but does not specify a class, it means the combined number of levels in all classes that grant access to that talent.”
CLASS LEVEL vs. CHARACTER LEVEL
The Star Wars Roleplaying Game uses the terms class level and character
level to mean different things. Class level pertains to a character's level in
a particular class. Character level pertains to a character's total experience.
So, a character who has only one class has a character level and
a class level that are the same. (A 7th-level Jedi has a character level
of 7th and a class level of 7th.) But for a character with more than one
class, class level and character level are different. A 4th-level scout/3rdlevel
scoundrel has a character level of 7th, with a scout class level of
4th and a scoundrel class level of 3rd.

---

### **Parmenter** (2010-08-30 01:40:09)

So, in short, any prestige class that gives access to the Lineage talent tree (i.e. Corporate Enforcer) counts as a class level for Wealth.

Yes, and thank you for mentioning that class, I had forgotten about it.

---

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-30 22:30:42)

Well thanks to all for that clarification. I appreciate the help. So I think we are going to start out as smugglers and see where that takes us. How are characters coming along?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-31 03:44:50)

Well, enough, though I have a question. Could you perhaps provide an opening crawl or just something about the game, in case there are anything we should include in our backgrounds?

### **DarthTardis** (2010-09-01 04:50:56)

It is a time of strife and war across the galaxy.The Jedi order has been scattered to the winds. Tyranny holds sway once more. The Sith Empire spreads its shadow across many worlds. With the Core and Deep Core locked down by the Imperial Security Zones all space travel is highly scrutinized and regulated. Violence is the rule of the galaxy. The fringe has become a lawless place where gangsters and pirates raid and work with out fear. There is credits to be made and fortunes won for ships willing to run the risks. Smuggling is at an all time high, people always have needs and those needs become more expensive the tighter the security. The newest crew of the *Idiot's Array* could have a bright future in store for them or they might end up like the last crew.
The *Idiot's Array* has been flying around the galaxy for over two hundred years. It has had more captains than a Tatooine call girl and seen more action than a Mando mercenary company. Her Captain's either leave their mark on history or disappear with out a trace. She draws crews from both sides of the spectrum from ruthless pirates to a short stint as an medical transport. No matter how badly she is damaged enough of her is always salvaged to rebuild and some other Captain comes along and feels the draw of her Destiny. The cycle begins anew.

### **Anonymous** (2010-09-01 09:40:18)

So I am new here...are you still accepting new players? Just as a reclaimer - I will be out of internet from Sept 6-11 - let me know if that would be a hindrance.
Also, could you let me know what roles still need filling?

---

### **DarthTardis** (2010-09-01 13:20:47)

So far no one has actually submitted a character so feel free to submit any style of character you want. I am fairly new to PbP as well just ask any questions you may have. The people here are very friendly and helpful. I don't think your black out dates will hinder you. If you are looking for other games as well Frost/Alicia/Magical all have casting calls going on as well.

### **Frost** (2010-09-02 23:19:26)

I am working on a Verpine engineer. Should have something posted soon

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-09-03 15:59:03)

Well, here´s my take for the captain of the ship. I´m not done with the background yet, so if someone wants to hop on board, that´s fine. I´ve also got a few other things to finish up. If someone has suggestions for how to modify the ship, just speak up, though I think I made a pretty good smuggler´s vessel with the means I had available.
Oh yeah, I know the statblock of the YU-410 only gives it one double cannon, though every mentioning and picture of the ship I can find shows it as having 2-4 cannons, and the flavor text in GaW even says "its twin double laser cannons". So I hope it´s ok I gave it two cannons.

The business was quite successful, and he built up a large clientele of customers all over the Galaxy, eventually employing people to work for him in the process. Things were flowing fine, and he managed to build himself a solid structure in life, as well as a good amount of money. But not all good things last, unfortunately.
An overly ambitious employee of Doosras, a human named Gheron, apparently saw himself more fit than Doosra to lead the company. And apparently, he wasn´t very picky in how to go about achieving that either. A planted load of spice and an anonymous tip to the local authorities led to Doosra being pulled in.

Well what is your starting class?
* credits Starting Money for non wealth characters
Noble 18800 Cash 18800 Resources
Jedi 15200 Cash 15200 Resources
Scoundrel/Scout/Soldier 17000 Cash 17000 Resources
Characters with wealth get it RaW but no extra money or resources
Resources can be contacts you know like a medical supply company rep who slips you supplies at a reduced cost or a old friend from med school. See Pg 75 Scum & Villainy
Favors
Purchasing your favor at the beginning provided you with an ally as per the rules in Scum and Villiany (p75) with some modifications. Players may initially build their contact, but any levels the contact acquires after starting is distributed by the GM.
They provide their assistance free of charge, as long as the heroes maintain good relations.
All purchased allies start with an attitude of friendly. Friendly allies will happily offer advice, information, or-when asked- assistance, as long as no substantial risk or cost is involved.
Allies with a helpful attitude is quick to contact the hero when opportunities arise (even if the helpful ally stands to gain little); furthermore, they will accept significant (but not foolhardy) risks and costs to assist the hero.
If an ally has an attitude lower than friendly toward the hero, they will be less likely to assist the hero in his endeavors.
A hero can attempt to improve his ally's attitude with him by reciprocating favors or by any other creative means.
Assistance
A hero can gain assistance from their ally at no additional cost provided it is within the ally's means. The ally can also provide money (as a loan) or equipment. In either case the ally can offer a total value of (CL x 1,000) credits in either cash, commodities or equipment. The items can be from any availablity but are subject to whether the ally would have access to the items.
For example, a Jedi Historian may have a collection of lightsaber crystals or even holocrons but wouldn't have access to an assortment of illegal blaster rifles.
To gain equipment and commodities, the hero may be required to have the money to front the cost of the item and/or license. For example, the CL 3 arms dealer has access to a Micro Grenade Launcher which costs 2,500 credits. The hero may need to pay the cost of the weapon (2,500 credits) and, if applicable, the licence.
When a hero gains assistance from their ally, they will make a Persuasion check making a "change attitude" check to insure their relations with their ally. The ally's attitude after the check will determine the ally's willingness to assist the hero in the future.
Leveling an ally
As a hero grows and develops, so may their ally. An ally may never be more than two CLs above the hero. Through your adventures you can send money to your ally which would also allow them to develop in their areas of expertise. By supporting them monetarily you can maintain your good relations and increase their usefulness.
Level| Cost (credits per level)
1-5 | 1,500
6-10 | 2,000
11-15 | 3,000
15-20 | 5,000

### **Anonymous** (2010-10-19 02:58:02)

If this game is still going to happen I would like to join. I am working on a Scout character. Basic concept is a crewman who helps/ tries to help guide the ship out of trouble, knows out of the way places to hide and other such Scouty things. My suggestion on a ship would be the YX 1980. It looks cool, has a great layout and it's main focus is defense, which is what smugglers need in my opinion.
EDIT: I think the Maka Eekai L4000 would be a good ship as well. Without the mods it is close to what you have on the YU ship (as I write this I can't remember the rest of the ship designation). Page 119 and 120 of the FUCG. If you compare the two the only negative is the initial cost. It also looks cool and has a floor plan, which I like a lot. Once I figure out the loan mechanics I will have my character get one, maybe RP losing a drunkin Sabaac game to DA's character.
Anyway, or either way, let me know if this game is still alive.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-10-24 11:00:43)

Without knowing for absolute certain that this game is going to happen (a deadline or, getting a game forum or something would be nice DT), I´ve been looking into my character a bit more, and I´ll probably have something revised up soon. I´m thinking of making my background rather generic, so that anyone who wishes to hop on can do so.
@Dorsay: That was a really nice ship, I think I´ll switch my preference to that. The biggest drawbacks I see is the initial cost, and the lack of EP, but that can always be fixed.

How many players are you looking for? As far as I can tell, you´ve got 4 interested players right now (not counting TrenVeinfield since he hasn´t been on in about a month).

Okay, so this is my initial character submission. I haven't come up with a solid background yet or equipment. I am still debating on a couple options there. As I said before, this is a concept I believe can make 'smuggling' easier and add another layer of depth by allowing actual stealth and other sneaky stuff.

Sorry lost this thread for a bit. I am still interested, but my schedule seems to only allow about once a week for posting now, maybe twice in a good week. If your still willing to accept that I will be happy to play.
