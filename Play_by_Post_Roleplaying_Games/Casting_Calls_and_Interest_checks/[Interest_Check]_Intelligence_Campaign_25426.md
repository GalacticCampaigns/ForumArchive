# [Interest Check] Intelligence Campaign

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-04-19 07:53:26)

This is just an interest check and not a formal casting call, since I need input on a few details for a new campaign idea I had. Somewhat inspired by me recently taking up the Imperial Agent storyline in The Old Republic, I though about running an intelligence-based campaign. As in, the characters would be operatives for whatever intelligence organization seems appropriate, such as Imperial Intelligence, SIS, the Bothan Spynet, or perhaps even as a freelance mercenary unit.
The campaign would span a number of varied missions from infiltration to sabotage to exploration to interrogation, and possibly - depending on moral affiliations - assassination and extraction. A variety of character styles would be supported, as usually everyone have something to bring to the table if they only think about it.
One thing I was hoping to get a chance of doing was to use the Skill Challenge rules from *Galaxy of Intrigue*, which I think seems to have great potential, but that I have seen very little use of in practice.
The main thing I would like to get input on (other than seeing how much interest there would be for a campaign like this) is the setting of the campaign. My own preference would be the Old Republic era, with players operating on either side in the Great Galactic War and/or the Cold War, or as an alternative they could be freelancers performing similar services for the Hutt Cartels.
What do you say?

I was wondering if and when you'd think about running another game? Count me in.
I'm unfamiliar with the setting of The Old Republic, not having played it. I would think the best setting would be one where we have very few resources to draw upon. Our side really needs to be the underdog in whatever conflict is going on if there is all out war.
A Cold War could have it's own fun too, making contacts and turning them, more danger of instigating open conflict.
Either Old Republic, Rebellion, or New Republic (fighting against remnants of the Empire). I think all three have their merits.

My preference for the Old Republic era comes mostly from it being a place of some of the greatest Star Wars stories I know (both KotOR games, TOR), and also from being a very diverse era for play. There is plenty of opportunities for you to both be and encounter Force users (as opposed to say Rebellion era) of both sides, and it also holds some of the greater major conflicts in galactic history, with much room in the background to play in.
The way I see it, intelligence agents does not necessarily need to have scarcity of resources. In fact, just like military forces, they most likely have access to some of the best gear available. Unlike military units though, they most likely will have to do with what they have, with very limited access to supplies and reinforcements during a covert assignment. I was thinking of running something along the lines of the requisition system from *Galaxy at War*, where you can requisition gear at the beginning of a mission, but after that you would be pretty much on your own as the situation demands.

Sounds reasonable. I'm someone who likes working with limited resources.

Sounds good, though I see more potential game play in the Rebellion era. Not to say that the other eras would not be fun as well but imagine this:
-rebels spy`s infiltrating imperial networks/ bases, hero`s who stole the death star designs or even new Tie fighter specs. Hell steal the Tie advanced prototype.
-Imperials scavenging for hidden rebel bases, or Xwing weaknesses.
-Or my fav, independent stealing all of the above and walking the fine line of selling to the opposing side or selling back to the original side to prevent it from falling into their enemy hands.
A group of the kind would potentially require characters of different spec, think mission impossible (the first one with the whole team at the beginning). In short I would be interested.

Okay, that´s two people interested, nice. I´d like for at least 3-4 people, though I suppose I could run with fewer for a start if no more interest turns up. But there´s no rush really, so this´ll remain open for a little while.
I think I´m going to settle for the Rebellion era, or possibly some blend of Rise of the Empire/Rebellion eras. That does come with the distinct advantage of being able to shoot stormtroopers <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> Let´s see if I get some more input, or I will start to form some more distinct baseline for this shortly.

Posting interest as well.
Hopefully I could complete an app by the end of the week.
I'm considering creating a Clawdite infiltrator with Force abilities. The Cloak and Phase Force power could come in handy.
Cheers! <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

If this is still a live concept, I'm interested in playing. I'll happily play in either era (since I have some familiarity with Old Republic stuff) and I will also be willing to make any type of character that is needed to round out the party.
