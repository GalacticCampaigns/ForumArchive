# Star Wars Bounty interest check

### **master_Tru** (2013-10-27 17:15:29)

Star Wars Bounty
Hello everyone. I have been mulling over an idea for a site based star wars RPG, meaning that every member could play within the RPG itself should they wish to. The idea has an issue though, it needs both players and GMs.
SO here it is an interest check to see if we can gather enough members to go forward with this project. Let me run you through a basic overview:
-Players would have their own merc/bounty hunter (possibly two)
-this is not a campaign but rather a potential series of operations/jobs/missions/adventures.
-casting calls would be in the form of a bounty board where players could express their interest, provided that that character is not currently on a mission.
-casting call applicants for missions would be chosen on a point system, each player would have a point total determined by adding point if they are running a game and subtracting points if the are currently playing a game (more points for running a game/mission)
-with multiple GM`s various mission could run at the same time, therefore various games at the same time.
-individual missions/adventures could be bounty hunter type chasing down/tracking a target, merc style hired guns/pilots combinations of both, though adventures would not be limited to this.
-this style of RPG gaming gives players a chance to GM a short game, even when they normally never ran a game before (of course if a member is GMing that members character is not in that mission, though could be playing in another mission)
Basically players would be members of a bounty Hunter/ Mercenary guild hired for various missions/adventures jobs. Missions would gain the players both credit and reputation, while multiple missions could be run at the same time with a large enough member base. The potential for this is only limited to the imagination of both the players and GM`s, and with possibly various of both this could be a really great game for all.
Once again this is an interest check, it will not work without both players and GM`s. SO what do you think? Do you have what it takes to run with the Bounty Hunter Guild WILD CARDS?

Oddly enough, I was thinking more or less this same idea this week with some other systems. I'd only add that there's the job generator in [Scum and Villainy](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Scum_and_Villainy_(sourcebook) "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Scum_and_Villainy_(sourcebook)") which might also be a good resource for GMs to use. I've also been pretty pleased with the [Mythic GM Emulator](http://www.mythic.wordpr.com/page14/page9/page9.html "http://www.mythic.wordpr.com/page14/page9/page9.html") and my limited experience with [Roll20.net](http://roll20.net/ "http://roll20.net/"), both of which may also be fun to use here.
All that to say: Yeah, I'm in - pending some good numbers of interested folks. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

The job generator in Scum and Villainy book was going to be one of the suggestions I would give members who wanted to give GMing a try but never had n the past. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

This sounds like a lot of fun... depending on the amount of players/dm's that it could get....

### **Anodyzed** (2013-10-27 21:24:55)

I would also be up for this. I've run a goodly portion of "Dawn of Defiance" on my own site, and some other adventures loosely arranged as a non-organized campaign, so I have some experience with play-by-post. Sadly, EVERY game I've gone through the gamut to get into here has gone down, so I finally just quit the whole "try out" thing, it just wasn't worth the trouble! This sounds like a good process: 'contribute' to be able to participate.

### **BWS2K** (2013-10-27 21:55:51)

Ah, Anodyzed - some of that was my fault, though I can't apologize for life happening. I hear you though - I've been play-by-posting for about three years now and so many games never make it past the interest check or character creation/submission stage, it's unfortunate. I saw a really interesting and similar idea for the Mutants and Masterminds 3e system over on the 'Playground site where there's basically a group of GMs who offer to run different issues/adventures for a shared pool of players. They've had a ton of response but I had to drop out because I don't think comic-ish enough for that system I guess. It was really neat though. Time will tell if it lasts - but the key is definitely reciprocation.
My thoughts on this sort of thing were essentially:
1) More than one GM, or taking turns to GM, depending on how many folks we get in.
2) Making use of the tables in the books, like the job generator and even the hazards listed in various books (notably the Unknown Regions) just to spice things up. A particular contract need not be more than a page or two of posts, minus combat, unless the GM really feels like it. Do the job, award the XP and loot, close the thread and move on.
3) Not everyone has the Mythic GME but using some sort of random event mechanism is almost crucial to a GM who's going to be running lots of little missions like this. For me, anyway, I just can't come up with good material like that. Having something that can keep it interesting for me as well is, well, more interesting. I have a couple examples of me using the GME to solo a bit and write creatively just for fun that I don't mind sharing for those interested.
4) If at all possible, try out a live chat for some parts. Maybe just the combat, or maybe the RP in-between missions, or just to get on the same page as the other players before launching this thing. Posting can be time consuming but a thirty minute chat session can accomplish a lot.
So yeah, I don't know what a critical mass for players would be, considering I don't think there's more than half a dozen players active on the site anymore. I can't commit to anything uber-long-term or in-depth, but I don't mind GMing a few solo or small party adventures. I'm still sort of running a game in Freeform for Alicia right now anyway, and she might be interested in something like this for her Jedi gal. Something tells me DarthAnthrax would be all over this too but I haven't seen him in a while.

I have no time line at the moment for this interest check, I will keep it open for some time to allow more members to see it as membership activity has diminished <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->
I was also going to post this interest check on the Mayhen site as well, to further increase its chances.

Hey i'm interested in giving this a go

### **Anodyzed** (2013-10-30 20:35:06)

Once we have decided its worth a try, those who will be running games will need to agree (or will we?) on character creation guidelines.
Well, we'll need to discuss it anyway. What would be the location that takes place?

---

### **master_Tru** (2013-10-30 21:15:27)

The character creation guidelines would yes be the same for all game(s), also there would be only one thread for character sheets. Each player would have 1 to 2 character to use for missions and could only use a character for a new mission as long as the character was not in a mission. Therefore each casting call (bounty board) would not require new characters just an interest in signing up then a tally of player points or whatever we call the point system.

### **BWS2K** (2013-10-30 21:28:44)

Well it's still an interest check, so it might be a bit premature... but I'll give it a whirl anyway! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
It's been awhile since I SAGA'd officially, but I tend to think level four or five is decent. Low enough to make hordes of minions potentially dangerous yet high enough to have some fun quirks and reputations, and if we let players write up a cool back-story based on a mission or two that they've done before joining the Wild Cards then it could... dang it. I was interrupted. I don't remember how to finish that sentence. You get the idea. Oh! The job generator sometimes calculates things like "CL-2", so having a high enough level to still make those parts interesting is probably best. The tally points might not be necessary if we don't have a lot of interest - GMs would just post contracts and then award XP at the end. Crazy equipment awards should be more or less outlawed, I suppose. Do we have an era in mind? I always enjoy the Rise of the Empire time myself. If we play our (wild) cards right, we could even do some wacky crossovers and put out contracts on Han or something.
What we really need is a base, or at least a network and an idea of how the contracts are issued. Are we just offering whatever we want, or should we try and just have the common point of acting as the Bounty Hunter's Guild? It could be neat to have all the characters rising through the ranks of the Guild, per *Force Unleashed*'s organizations section. We could each have our own area of operations and still be Guild liaisons though. What I'm trying to say is that I imagine myself GMing a scenario (or "contract") by posting a listing in the appropriate sub-thread and letting players "apply" by simply stating their interest and, if necessary, tally points. When I have someone to fill a contract, then I'd open up another sub-thread in the GM section for that player or players to play in. When they finish, the thread closes and awards are given and I work up another contract. It does give the opportunity to use Leadership and Followers and stuff like that, btw, which could be cool.
How does all that strike ya'll so far?

### **master_Tru** (2013-10-30 21:50:58)

As for level I was thinking something 3rd to 5th. Crazy equipment would have to be approved I would think, though it could be potentially allowed if it was plot impacting for the mission at hand (not necessarily after). Rise of the Empire makes has a tons of room for opportunity if used correctly, it was also in my top 2 for Era`s to use.
As for a base of operations I wanted the bounty hunter guild/ mercenary company to grow with the players as they advance/ succeed or fail. Starting off in a dusky cantina named The Spacers Nest, then growing from there. Anyway much to discuss and if we can generate the interest I feel that it would be a great RPG platform.
