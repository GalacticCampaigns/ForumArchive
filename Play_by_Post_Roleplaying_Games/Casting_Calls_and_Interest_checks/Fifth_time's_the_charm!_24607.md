# Fifth time's the charm!

Heh. In case anyone's wondering, the subject is referring to how many campaigns I've started only to have them die horrible, painful deaths. However, as the saying goes, "The only way to truly fail is to stop trying." So, here we go again!
I'm wondering how much interest there would be in a Star Wars game set in a new galaxy, outside the one we're used to. (Also, separate from the Kalium galaxy, just to clarify.) The reasoning behind this is that it would give us the opportunity to create new and interesting stories without being tied down to an existing galaxy and its inhabitants.
The majority of the species (and all of the planets) would be made by either the GM (me) or the players (you). Same goes for ships, equipment, etc. Though we could certainly use existing stuff and just call it something different, for simplicity's sake. In other words, this is a chance to use all the self-made species, weapons, Force powers, feats, talents, and whatever else you want. I'd even allow things to be brought in from other universes (like Mass Effect or Star Trek) within reason.
Basically, it would be a unique, never-before-seen setting, while still retaining that familiar Star Wars feel. The Force would still exist, however the Jedi and the Sith would not. A blank slate on which we can write anything we want. So, would anyone be interested in such a game? And if so, where would I post a casting call for it? Would I pick one of the eras or post it in the general rpg section? Let me know what you all think.

Probably general is my guess.

Yeah, that's what I was thinking too. Just for fun, here's a species I just finished pulling over from Mass Effect. Most of the background information is from the Mass Effect wiki. Feel free to offer constructive criticism.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Drell**</span> ![Drellface2.jpg](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/a/a9/Drellface2.jpg)
Drell are omnivorous reptile-like humanoids with an average lifespan of 85 galactic standard years. Drell appearance is very similar to humans, but their muscle tissue is slightly denser, giving them a wiry strength. Many of their more reptilian features are concealed, however one unique characteristic is the hyoid bone in their throats, which allows them to inflate their throats and produce vocal sounds outside of the human range. They also have two sets of eyelids, like crocodiles. Drell possess the ability to shed tears.
The drell possess eidetic memory, an adaptation to a world where they must remember the location of every necessary resource (vegetation, drinkable water and prey migration paths) across vast distances. The memories are so strong that an external stimulus can trigger a powerful memory recall. These recalls are so vivid and detailed that some drell may mistake it for reality.
**Homeworld:** Kahje
**Languages:** Drell and Basic
**Example Names:** Thane Krios, Kolyat Krios, Feros
**Adventurers:** Those who leave Kahje tend to be adventurers. These solitary drell travelers often seek out new species elsewhere, and in turn adopt that species' culture. Such drell number in the thousands, and are scattered across the galaxy, tending towards quiet, integrated lives.
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Drell Species Traits**</span>
Drell share the following species traits:
**Ability Modifiers:** -2 Con +2 Wis
**Size:** Medium
**Speed:** 6 squares
**Eidetic Memory:** A Drell may reroll any knowledge check to remember something they have learned, accepting the better result.
**Conditional Bonus Feat:** Any Drell with skill training in any knowledge category gains Skill Focus (that knowledge category) as a bonus feat.
**Automatic Languages:** Drell, Basic

few question Zen.
i've got some custom stuff that i would love to play but some of it requires i higher level build and some just flat doesnt work in the average game. you can see some of it in the wiki on Hunter Lords. the system is on the outside edge of the cannon galaxy, so if you do this game can your galaxy be on the other side of it so to speak? lol gives some more detail, and once i finally get around to finishing the aforementioned wiki there's also a prestige class designed for that system that id love the chance to play, i'll send it to ya if i ever get it ready

Actually, since this idea doesn't seem to be getting much interest, I think I'm just going to do a normal game. But custom made stuff will still be allowed, such as the drell. I'll have the casting call up in the Old Republic in a few minutes.
