# [SKYPE] Interest Check: Starblazer Adventures Experiment

### **Sketchpad** (2011-03-15 19:24:44)

Hiya Gang!
I'm considering running a short mini-campaign via Skype and was wondering if anyone would be interested in playing. This isn't a Casting Call (at least not yet), so please don't post characters to this thread. The game I'm interested in using is [**Starblazer Adventures**](http://www.cubicle-7.com/starblazer.htm "http://www.cubicle-7.com/starblazer.htm"), which is a variation of the [**FATE System**](http://www.faterpg.com/ "http://www.faterpg.com/"). The game is quite easy to pick up and a bit free form to play.
As for the adventure itself, I'm looking at the following to run:
• Three to Four two hour sessions
• Four Players (possibly Five)
• No experience necessary
• Webcam is preferred, as I'm interested in how Skype would work with a group
• Setting is currently under consideration. I could do Star Wars, I could do Firefly, or I could concoct something up myself. I'm currently considering pre-gens for the characters, as it would just be easier to run that way, though I would entertain some thoughts on that.
I'm still looking into finalizing some ideas, and will be updating this info as it gets closer to running. Please feel free to post questions about the adventure, system or anything else related to it here and I will try my best to get to it. Thanks <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

You know I'm in. We've discussed already when I would be available.
I personally like SW games but Fireflyesque could be fun too.
