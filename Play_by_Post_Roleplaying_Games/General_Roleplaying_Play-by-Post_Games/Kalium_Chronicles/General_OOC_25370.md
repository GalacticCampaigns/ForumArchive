The Troupe can use this to discuss out of game information and coordinate ideas.

I got a wiki going last night: <!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/](http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/ "http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/")<!-- m -->
The more I work on it the more I realize:

1. I'm probably too organized for this thing
2. We probably don't have enough information to put in one yet
3. there's a lot of prep work I'm likely to have to get done so people understand how I'm organizing it.

Maybe I'm just reading too much into how this should be organized, but I'm also trying to make it possible for other games to use it as well, though considering in the past we had a wiki and it was never used, not sure if I shouldn't just use it for Kalium.
Anyways... I'm going to work on typing up the information that's rolling in my head and in the meantime work on a first post. If all goes well, maybe a post by Sunday.
In the meantime please through out advice for the Wiki and how to organize this forum.
I've already put my character up on there (something else I was debating about, whether to put characters there exclusively or still have a troupe thread here).

I've compiled a rudimentary guide in getting your character up on the wiki.
<!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/index &#8230; Characters](http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/index.php?title=Getting_Started:_Characters "http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/index.php?title=Getting_Started:_Characters")<!-- m -->
Feel free to make use of it to get your sheets up.
Let me know if you have questions.
I seriously need to stop distracting myself. More I work on this, the more I find to do!

Hey Duggs.
As an FYI to you and future players, characters won't necessarily have to be approved. Granted we'll all be making recommendations in an effort to guide new players toward keeping the feel of the setting but otherwise this is a way for people to exercise their creativity and add to a growing story.
That's why I never really said anything in the casting thread past my initial thoughts on what I had planned.
You and Ryder (and anyone else for that matter) is free to start making use of the wiki. Great place to start is adding your characters. Its designed to allow for open editing by members and if anything needs fixed then there will be open communication to do so (unless it's just organizing and I'll take care of that).
Can't wait to get it started!

I'll transfer my char to the wiki this week and upload the other info we discussed

NP. I'm not liking my post so I'll be holding onto it for a bit longer. Sorry for the delay but in sure you'd agree to post something I felt confident in.

### **Alicia** (2013-07-08 13:01:12)

OK. Decided just to post what I have. Hopefully it's enough to get things going. Let me know if you have questions but otherwise go crazy. Other than what I have posted I really have nothing else written up for king's stand.
Feel free to intro your character as you see fit. I'll be working on my character intro today as well

The issue has arisen as to how to handle character sheets.
It's been my intention to have all sheets stored in the wiki, since it's a good centralized place everyone would have access to.
<!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/index &#8230; s_Personae](http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Dramatis_Personae "http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Dramatis_Personae")<!-- m -->
Here's a small guide to get started in posting characters on there.
<!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/index &#8230; Characters](http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/index.php?title=Getting_Started:_Characters "http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/index.php?title=Getting_Started:_Characters")<!-- m -->
From there you can link to your character in the sig, but putting it in the wiki gives a place to document for the development of characters and history of Kalium.
Hope that all makes sense, but if everyone has a better idea, please let's discuss.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-08-12 18:44:19)

Yeah with Myth weavers allowing windows now I'll be creating it there and linking it in my SIG then getting it uploaded to the wiki in the appropriate place

Would hope the template I put in the Getting Started page corresponding with character sheets would be helpful too <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

If I may ask what tech level is the world at? I have read the wiki a bit and steamworks are mentioned. Are there rudimentary firearms or anything of that sort? Is it a feudal system of government for many places? Sorry if I am just missing the answers but I wanted to join in the fun and did not want to mess up any of the details.

### **Alicia** (2014-10-28 19:40:24)

Kalium is more on the fantasy side of things. While I suppose there's some "steampunk" elements the original intention was to have a custom Fantasy world we could develop. Suffice to say... I'd never thought about the existence of firearms, but I think for the sake of the fantasy feel I'm going to say if they do exist they are rare and rather expensive.
As for government, I imagine each aeropolis or geopolis has it's own system, though I could see feudal being the most prevalent.

### **Alicia** (2014-10-29 08:13:49)

I was thinking last night of you wanted to jump in on A Strange World I could move the scene ahead a bit. Or if you wanted to get creative you can start a new thread and I can jump in. If by chance you wanted to explore the world alone I understand, just let me know.
Been trying to get Yogi going in this too so may have a 3rd down the line unless Ryder or Bw gets some interest back

### **Lorky-to-to** (2014-11-22 16:11:29)

All right I will read over the past posts in the current narrative and decide wherein I would fit if you wanted to allow me to join.

---

### **Alicia** (2014-11-23 17:17:57)

BW and I have been talking too about starting a new one. There's that option as well.
Hadn't heard from you so figured you had lost interest already.

### **Lorky-to-to** (2014-11-25 18:08:35)

I hadn't lost interest just ended up really busy. The setting is intriguing to me
