## Re: A Strange New World

### **Alicia** (2013-07-08 12:58:57)

The Valkyrie caravan has found some refuge at the geopolae of King's Stand. The history of the name having long been forgotten by the inhabitants of the small geopolae. Their pride however comes from the monastery protected within its walls and anyone you ask would boast it has the largest and most intact library of pre Mage War texts.
This is of course why the caravan has come: to seek out what can be learned from this rare repository. Many petitioners come to the monastery. From the young mage, the ambitious scholar or the curious.Most, however, are turned away. As the reputation of the geopolae and monastery grows so does it attract those with anti-magic sentiments.
The caravan has set up camp outside the geopolae. While under normal circumstances travelers find refuge in the fortress cities the members of the caravan prefer the company of their fellow members. Using their carts to set a perimeter they errect their tents with practiced ease. Each member of the caravan has their own task and having just arrived there's no lack of activity.

Tolfson worked quietly with a few of the other defenders of the caravan unloading their wagon. After setting up their tent he works with a few to setup a training area while others begin making rounds to set up a perimeter around the caravan to protect the Valkyries.
The training area only consisted of an empty circle of stones and a few full sized dummies for blade throwing. Once everything is set he takes a break and lazily practices throwing a set of his small throwing daggers at the dummy targets.

The palfrey plods almost silently down the beaten road. It had been a tiring journey, but as the young woman spots the growing camp of the caravan a surge of energy surges through the pair. Bounding forward into his smooth, ambling gait, the palfrey quickly crosses the distance.
Bringing him up short just inside the newly constructed barrier, a sign the caravan intended on staying for awhile, the young hooded woman looks around for a familiar face.
With a frown she dismounts, confused by all the new faces, all the new thoughts. Leaning against her horse she draws strength from the simplicity of the creature’s mind. *Have I really been away from people for so long?*
A nearby thud draws her to her senses. Peering over the horse’s back she spots the practice area. Ever since she had been a girl, the sight of the practice yard was a constant. Leading the horse toward the yard, she leaves her horse just outside the cleared circle. She was bound to run into a familiar face at some point and she was glad to avoid the fuss that would follow for as long as possible. Her hood darkening her face against the glare of the sun, the young woman watches from a polite distance as the knife thrower practices his craft.

The small blades left his hand lazily one by one, all remarkeably hitting the dummy with little effort. When Tolfson went to retrieve the ones he had thrown he felt as if he was being watched, a feeling all to familiar to him in his past wanderings when he used his ability once too many. He glanced about as he plucked his blades from the dummy and turned to head back and saw the slim hooded figure, female perhaps? He was unsure but he didnt recognize her either. She seemed at peace within the camp and he decided to show off a little.
Takeing a stance a good twenty feet from the dummy he pulled back and threw the blade, leaving his hand outstretched as the blade flew towards the target. The blade flew true and landed perfectly center of the faded red bullseye on the torso. Pulling his next he threw it in the same manner and it landed with a thud in the head of the dummy. Smirking he pulled his next and purposely threw it wide, the blade easily five feet to the right of the target, then twisted his outstretched hand slightly and the blade altered direction and landed with a thud in the right side of the head.
His next he pulled and threw in one quick under handed motion, the blade flew directly towards the target but high. At the last moment he twitched his hand again and it dove into the top of the head. He smirked as he threw his last with his other hand. The blade flew fast and wide and as it passed the target on the left he drew both his hands to his chest. The blade flipped and reversed direction in a simple twist and plumetted deep into the back of the target.
He paused a moment to admire his work and to see what reaction the hooded figure might have before strolling back to the target to retrieve his blades.

Caught observing, Jaclyn moves closer, still keeping a cautious distance from the expert throws. The ease in which the man tossed the daggers was mystifying, though it wasn’t hard to guess that he was attuned to the daggers and most likely manipulated them through a form of telekinesis. A thought proved well enough when one of the blades changes direction completely.
The show over, she claps just loud enough for him to hear and not draw much attention to her as she moves closer to intercept him before he regains any position to begin again.
It was clear to her this man had come to find some refuge within the caravan. Many with magic had found their way here, particularly if they couldn’t find the means to make it to an aeropolis where their abilities were more accepted and even welcomed.
“**Very impressive,**” the young woman praises in low tones so not to carry. “**Your skill is most uncanny with the blade.**”

### **Ryder2101** (2013-08-13 10:35:21)

He pauses in step to face her and give her a semi-formal bow. "**Thank you M'lady. I've practiced for years but I truly find myself when I'm close and personal with these.**" He pats the two curved blades hooked to each side of his hips. "**I am Tilike, M'lady. You seem at ease here, are you familiar with the Valkyries?**"

### **Alicia** (2013-08-13 11:58:12)

“**Tilike. I’m Jaclyn.**” she says, with a slight bow of her head. Briefly, the young woman wonders if he would recognize her name, but decides it can’t be helped. The hood shifts back slightly, revealing some of her features. Her dark careworn eyes meet his, and he might get the sense of deep wisdom of an older soul.
“**It’s been awhile since I’ve crossed paths with the caravan, but Vivian was most adamant I come to her impending handfasting.**” With a glance around she once more takes in the sight of the continuing work. “**And you, have you been among them long?**”

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-08-13 14:08:20)

He glances around and sees on of the fighters pass nearby on patrol then looks back at her. "**I have only been with the caravan for a few full moons. Joined shortly after a disagreement at a geoplae when my uncanny ability surfaced during a fight defending a young girl from some thugs. Didn't kill them but they won't ever run the same. Personally I don't believe in ending life when its not required, not when I can disable an opponent from being a further threat.**"
He tucked his throwing blades away into his belt and pulled one of the blades from his hip. His hand on the grip the blade curved back over his hand almost to his elbow. The edge obviously sharp with a serrated edge on the curved portion near the grip. He looked it over in thought, the dark metal giving a slight reflection of his face, before he replaced it his hip.

Jaclyn watches him carefully as his mind drifts to other things. From his matter-of-fact tone she got the impression he was used to the fighter’s life, but unlike many he hadn’t yet lost sight of the value of other lives.
“**I’m sure Kreger has found your skill of most value then**.” Behind her, her palfrey kicks his hooves in excitement and suddenly a barrier in her thoughts is brushed aside with a familiar presence. She hadn’t been trying to hide, if she had the barrier wouldn’t have been broken easily, but it was only a matter of time. “**Uh oh. I’ve been noticed.**”
Turning slightly, she sees Alena rushing toward them, stopping first to pat the eager horse on the nose. The distance is crossed quickly as the younger woman, her hair a mess of the straw she had just been bailing. Alena disregards any sense and embraces Jaclyn causing her to wince from the rush of emotions and thoughts transferred by the touch.
Sensing her older sister’s discomfort, Alena steps back embarrassed. “**Sorry, Jace. I forgot for a moment.**”
“**No matter. I doubt it’ll be the last,** Jaclyn smiles, adjusting the hood that had been thrown back completely with her sister’s antics.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-08-14 03:01:47)

Tolfson nods for a moment as he's brought back to his surrounds and watches the younger woman he'd seen, but not spoken too, around the camp. Even after more than a moon's passing he had still found it hard to open up to many of the other members of the caravan and usually stayed with the defenders and practiced his blade craft. Many of his days had been spent matching his blades against others, finding himself only bested by Kreger himself consistently. On occasion he repaired the occasional weapon or mended someone's armor, but mostly his time was his unless pulling watch.
"**Evening M'lady,**" he said bowing his head slightly to the young lady. He was not a tall man but years of labor and constant practice with his blades he had built up a moderate amount of muscle in his upper body, giving him an almost V like shape. His off white tunic hung loosely about his body while his leather hide pants fit albeit more snugly. The look gave him a gruff woodsman/hunter feel but his eyes spoke of a softer yet troubled man.

"**Evening, Defender**, Alena says, suddenly going shy with having to speak with someone outside of her family. “**Uh, Mother and Vivian will be back from the monastery soon, then we’ll have tea.**” Now flabbergasted at her own lack of manners, she turns and rushes away. Jaclyn is left shaking her head slightly in amusement, especially as Alena meets up with her horse and it follows her obediently without much prompting.
“**Sorry for Alena. She tends to be more comfortable with her animals than with people. What she meant to say was you’re invited to tea.**”

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-08-15 19:15:55)

He nods his head in agreement, his shoulder length brown hair swishing about his head. "**That would be enjoyable. I will see you then after I hear word that they have returned to camp.**" He bows with an odd flair and begins to turn and sees one of the other defenders approaching. He pauses to see what he wants and discusses an issue with him regarding one area of the perimeter that may be a security risk. He nods again to Jaclyn and waves as he follows the younger man to see for himself.

### **Alicia** (2013-08-17 23:41:44)

Jaclyn watches the defender walk away to continue in his own business before, with a sigh, she turns to follow Alena and retrieve her gear. Pleased to find her gear and small collection of possessions stacked against a makeshift picket, she leaves her horse in Alena’s more than capable hands and proceeds to find the tent she’d be sharing with her sisters. Esme was quick to find her and kept up a steady stream of chatter for her older sister, catching her up on all the gossip while Jaclyn cleaned up and changed. Jaclyn took advantage of her sister’s gabbiness and asked her what she knew of Tolfson and wasn’t surprised it wasn’t much.
Now in a spare set of clothing Jaclyn kept in a trunk the caravan carried with them for just such occasions as when she returns. It was a simple top and skirt, but it significantly better repair than what she had arrived in. While not her best clothes, it was more suitable for her station within the caravan.
Word didn’t have to come that Vivian and Naomi had returned; intuitively Jaclyn knew. Walking with Esme, Jaclyn decides to get the worst of the fuss of her homecoming over before they could embarrass her in front of the rest of the caravan. There was one thing she had to do first, however.
“**Kreger!**”
“**Eh, lass. I heard you had returned,**” the weaponmaster’s eyes narrow at her as she catches up, Esme close behind. Before he can admonish her on her reliance on magic, she waves him off.
“**I need you to do me a favor. I invited one the defenders to tea. Tolfson’s his name. I have a feeling he won’t know where to come…**” The words draw off as she knows he would get what she wanted.
“**And you want me to collect him?**” he finishes easily, with a sigh. “**I’ll expect you in the practice ring afterwards,**” Kreger adds stalking back the way he had come. Jaclyn can only wince knowing what Kreger had in store for her in the ring.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-08-21 10:46:07)

After investigation of the possible security issue brought to his attention he found that just moving back the wagons on that area further from the wood line would be best. Better than stationing a defender there on constant rotation. Once everything was set and the view clear and unobstructed he returned to the training circle and practiced swinging his curved blades. He moved fluidly considering his size and bulk. Each swipe was graceful and precise. He ran through several sets of varied defensive and aggressive patterns until he broke a reasonable sweat then headed towards the tent to clean up before he headed over for tea with Jaclyn.

Kreger would catch up to Tolfson as he leaves the training yard. The gruff, middle-aged weapon master eyes the daggers suspiciously, his disdain for anything relating to magic well known. He sports broadsword at his waist and a pair of shorter swords crossed on his back. It would be a guarantee those aren't the only weapons on his person.
"**Eh lad… I hear you got yourself an invitation by one of the Valkyries?**"

---

### **Ryder2101** (2014-02-25 21:16:30)

Tolfson slows his step as Kreger approaches him and nods to the man in greeting.
"Yes, I met Jaclyn earlier, and her sister. She's been away awhile I understand."
He stopped for a moment and shifted his weight to his left leg and instinctively rested his hands on the hilts of his custom blades as he looked at the weapons master, and his instructor. He wondered if he saw the show he put on for Jaclyn, something he tried to only practice when he knew no one was around.

### **Alicia** (2014-02-25 21:27:40)

"**Aye, the lass comes and goes. Never staying long. There's always a fuss when she comes back, best to arrive late unless you want the show.**" He points toward the central tent, the gathering place for the caravan. Already there's a growing column of smoke from the fire pit within. "**That's where they'll be.**"

---

### **Ryder2101** (2014-02-25 21:33:47)

He nods to Kreger after looking where he gestured to then asked a question. "Show? I take it you will not be there Sir?" He begins to wonder about the girl he just met, not fully understanding her position in the camp yet. He decided he should probably tread a little lighter around her until he had a firmer grasp on the situation, he didn't want to find himself without a home again because of his actions.

"Eh? I wouldn't miss it, lad." He smiles mischievously, which comes out more like a grimace. "Only time you'll see that girl phased and I'm not about to miss that. They're a strange bunch."

Tolfson smirks slightly at Kreger's humor and nods his head. "Should be interesting then, hopefully I don't add too much to the strangeness." He tapped his index finger against the hilt of his custom blades as he looked off across the camp to the central tent, he thought he could smell the hint of fresh meat roasting in the air but it was faint and could just be his mind playing tricks. He looked back to Kreger and smiled then bowed his head slightly. "After you or are you coming later?"

### **Alicia** (2014-02-28 23:14:49)

"**Headin' over now,**" Kreger says. "**Eh, you should clean up some first. Gatherin' will last awhile.**" With that he turns to leave, letting Tolfson decide whether to come with him now or later.
People have already started to gather in the central tent, taking a break from the labor of setting up the camp. Laughter and the sound of women talking over each other comes from one particular side of the tent where the Valkyries are gathered. Lounging about on an assortment of pillows, the fair haired women are gathered around Jaclyn who looks rather uncomfortable to be at the center of attention and her sisters seem to be reveling in it. Tolfson recognizes Tessa, the oldest of the sisters and heavy with her first child, as the one who would have ensured Tolfson had what he needed upon deciding to stay with the caravan. He may not recognize the others depending on his interactions outside of the guards, but the familial resemblance is clear.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2014-02-28 23:38:22)

Tolfson pauses a moment trying to understand Kreger's meaning then realizes he still has the scent of his work out on him. He lowers his head a moment and nods to Kreger, "I'll see you there."
He quickly finds his way to his tent where he washes quickly and changes his shirt. Deciding to leave his blades strapped on knowing he won't need him he heads over to the gathering. Stepping in he focuses on the people situated around the tent. He recognizes many faces, some better than others since he's mainly only dealt with other defenders. He spots Jaclyn among the other Valkyries and Tessa who he gives a formal nod to when she happens to look his way. Unsure she even noticed he makes his way through the tent greeting others simply and briefly as he worked his way towards where the Valkyries were seated and stopped a few feat away and bowed rather deeply before them. "A fine evening M'lady."

Off to one side are two men who are talking to Kreger and overall just observing the gaggle. Kreger's attention seems diverted between the women and a dark haired woman walking around the sisters with a serving tray. Every now and then she glances over toward Kreger and gives him a small smile.
The women are laughing at something likely at Jaclyn's expense considering how uncomfortable she looks.
Jaclyn, Tolfson would notice, has changed out of her traveling clothes and has taken up the peasant top and ankle length skirt common with the women of the caravan. They're obviously not borrowed as she fits in them quite well.
The women quiet down as Tolfson approaches.
"Tolfosn, please join us. It's indeed a fine evening" Tessa says, the sisters agreeing except Jaclyn who doesn't seem to respond to that. Tessa accepts a refill from a pot the black haired girl is carrying. "Thank you, Aliera."
"When will mother be joining us?" Vivian asks from beside Tessa.
"Shortly, malady," Aliera responds. "She wanted to make sure the hospital was set up correctly."
"You mean she wanted to make arrangements for some party tonight," Jaclyn says with a sigh.
Aliera just beams.
From beside Jaclyn Esme says jokingly, "It's not everyday now the prodigal daughter graces us with her presence." To which everyone but Jaclyn laughs.

With a nod and partial smile Tolfson finds himself a mug and gets a fill from Aliera before she moves off to others and finds a spot to sit, though you might not call it sitting. It was more of a crouch as he took a spot on an unclaimed pillow near Jacyln and Esme, though his body rested on the pillow a quick shift of his weight and he could spring to his feet. He seemed uncomfortable but didn't show it on his face, he let a smile beam on his face and listened to the joking and teasing going on.

Conversation turns to filling Jaclyn in on the latest gossip within the caravan as well as any news they might have heard from the various geopoloae they've passed through. Tolfson would gather Jaclyn has been away from the Caravan for nearly half a year. Whenever one of the sisters tries to get Jaclyn to reveal what she's been doing during her travels, she gracefully changes the subject to something else. The only information they get out of her is that she's been traveling to the north.
