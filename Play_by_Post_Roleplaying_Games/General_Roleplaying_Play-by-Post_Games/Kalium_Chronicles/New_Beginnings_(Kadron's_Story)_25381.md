# New Beginnings (Kadron's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2013-08-10 20:23:01)

The night weighs heavily on Ser'ath Kadron Murabsyn, his first ever not spent on the familiar desert sands of Kruydrolina. His sleep is light and broken, and every new sound brings a feeling of being watched. It's a moonless night; Kadron can see little beyond the small clearing he's made camp in - and that only because of the few dying embers left from a fire to bring warmth on this cool summer evening. The hours pass slowly until one sound in particular commands his attention. Despite all the new noises he's heard tonight, there's no mistaking the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps.
Someone, or something, is coming straight for Kadron...

*'Kra'shooq!'* Kadron spat out in fury upon hearing the footsteps racing towards him. He quickly stood and stamped out the fire that he had been idly nurturing, embers licking his worn leather boots as he did.

He remembered his father's words and the gravity of his task; The future of the tribe rested on his shoulders and he wasn't going to be branded a failure.
**"Qo to ser'iiq!"** The young man called out in his native tongue, as he adjusted his shoulder armour hidden beneath his cloak, backing slowly towards a tree for cover.

A large hooded figure charges through the underbrush, headed right for Kadron. With the coals stamped out, the area is in near-total darkness - but the sound of a blade being drawn is clear. A loud guttural growl and a lunge brings the attacker into range...

A couple things: **1)** Give me a *natural warrior* roll in a spoiler in your next post. It's usually a target of 6 or less but in the low-light I'm going to make that a 5 or less. That's if you're wanting to draw your... fist weapon?... and parry - if you want to dodge, that's *Agility*. If you have another idea, that's fine - but the target number is still going to be a 5. If you succeed, I'll take it from there. If you don't, do a *health* roll with a target of 6 to see if you're wounded, in which case your *health* dice steps down temporarily. I hope that makes sense. I don't care much, I'm in casual-GM mode for this game.**2)** Mythweavers recently added sheets for Eclipse Phase and Windows, so it might be nice to make a sheet for Kadron and put it in your signature. If you'd rather have a thread here for characters let me know. Alicia and ryder didn't set one up, and I'm not sure why. **3)** We're sort of jumping right into things I know, but Mythic is all about "scenes" and I figure this is what you'd see before the title or credits roll at the beginning of a movie. We'll do some backstory afterwards. Lovin' the language stuff. ![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)

The words of his father reverberated through his core and he felt the blood thump through his arteries as the adrenaline started to kick in. His reached out with his senses into the darkness as the footsteps thundered louder towards him. The distinctive *schlink* of a blade being unsheathed was all he needed, his leathered fist tightened around the hand-hold in his polished gauntlet, the metal encasing his hand and forearm in an ornately decorated golden tomb.

Second, the Suu&#39;Var, the symbol of the hard work and toil that you must undergo to gain the recognition of the Kruydroltor, and finally, the Suu&#39;Tal, the symbol of responsibility. Responsibility that you will guide the Kruydrol and the Kruydroltor to a better future.&quot;*

It had a good weight to it, not unlike a large hammer, heavy, but not meant to burden, and with enough training could be wielded without effort. In the ways he had been trained, he thrust his fist out across his body in an attempt to parry the lunge at the last second.
**"Naa'raqii'riikhii"** He bellowed, channeling his emotions into his riposte.

Suu'Var in pictures:
Hopefully this is what will give you a flavour of what I'm going on about
[The hand is like this](http://azmal.deviantart.com/art/Lion-Armor-Claw-Gauntlets-87092043:3o2qwdfx "http://azmal.deviantart.com/art/Lion-Armor-Claw-Gauntlets-87092043:3o2qwdfx") so when clenched it has viscious/rather sizeable set of knuckles to it
[Picture a metallic version of this](http://azmal.deviantart.com/art/Dragon-Armor-Preview-2-Gauntlets-376779078:3o2qwdfx "http://azmal.deviantart.com/art/Dragon-Armor-Preview-2-Gauntlets-376779078:3o2qwdfx") for the material. Bumpy/small individual segments/rivetted almost.
[For the colour](http://azmal.deviantart.com/art/Gryphon-Gauntlets-86242905:3o2qwdfx "http://azmal.deviantart.com/art/Gryphon-Gauntlets-86242905:3o2qwdfx") or maybe closer to the Dwarvern armour from Skyrim. [Example 1](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pgE3qp-qoAQ/UJAPfK36e9I/AAAAAAACHek/Re-To2cEYJI/s1600/million+%28133%29.jpg:3o2qwdfx "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pgE3qp-qoAQ/UJAPfK36e9I/AAAAAAACHek/Re-To2cEYJI/s1600/million+%28133%29.jpg:3o2qwdfx") or [Example 2](http://media-curse.cursecdn.com/attachments/60/680/8e9522ab3a45766bc5a6fc23f611933d.JPG:3o2qwdfx "http://media-curse.cursecdn.com/attachments/60/680/8e9522ab3a45766bc5a6fc23f611933d.JPG:3o2qwdfx")
The design is going to be similar to the Suu'Mat, birds, eagles, lions, or whatever beasties are found in the deserts of this world, mixed in with ancient scriptures, proverbs...etc.
It's fairly chunky, i was originally thinking like the [powerfists](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSG6TKXjtlhnM4iUHS3pTnYI5bqfhh-AP-m4dskqvWWhEGY_wFY9Q:3o2qwdfx "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSG6TKXjtlhnM4iUHS3pTnYI5bqfhh-AP-m4dskqvWWhEGY_wFY9Q:3o2qwdfx") (or [here](http://images.dakkadakka.com/gallery/2009/9/9/52396_md-Power%20Fist,%20Space%20Marines,%20Tactical%20Squad,%20Warhammer%2040,000.jpg:3o2qwdfx "http://images.dakkadakka.com/gallery/2009/9/9/52396_md-Power%20Fist,%20Space%20Marines,%20Tactical%20Squad,%20Warhammer%2040,000.jpg:3o2qwdfx")) in 40k, if you've ever played that ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif) But it was a bit to plain and a bit TOO big without technology to wield.

Kadron's combat experience proves superior, as the figure is deftly redirected, face-first, into a very sturdy tree trunk a few paces away. The resulting noise is a mixture of a blade being dropped and what is almost certainly a concussion. The figure staggers back, shaking his head to clear it, and then turns to square off, unarmed, against the Kruydrol youth.
"**Not bad for a pup, but you're still going to die…**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Hmm. I hadn't consider the language barrier, but let's go with it. My guy's speaking... Common?... so whether or not Kadron will understand is up to you. Alicia asked that we submit character sheets to the wiki, but if you want to put it in your blog and let me know, I can transfer it. There's a process involved and I honestly don't remember what it is. Or you can do it directly. Either way, just let me know so I don't have to keep going to my messages to see your stats. ![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)

Grunting with annoyance at the common tongue, Kadron was in two minds whether to reply. He decided that actions speak louder than words. Not allowing his attacker to finish his sentence, he strikes out with his unarmed hand, aiming for his assailant's throat. If there was going to be any chit-chat it would be on Kadron's terms. Catching the shady individual's gullet, he lifts him off his feet before driving his back into the tree that he had already become acquainted with.
**"Khoo. You. Arhh?"** Kadron roared, his grip ever tightening. He'd snapped feebler necks before with a twist of his wrist, his father encouraged - some might call it forced - him to go into battle unarmed and to kill a man with his bare hands. Only when he had seen the life drain from someone's eyes at his hand and not of that of a tool would he know what it's like to kill.

Ah yeah, I forgot to mention I put it up on the wiki a few days ago ![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif) and it's now in my sig.
As for combat do we roll for every action? If so would it be another Natural Warrior roll?

"**What're you-**"
The man's eyes go wide at Kadron's display of strength. His arms flail for help and find none, so he tries to understand the request: "**Yo-…askin-…myname?…**"
A choked laugh and then, under the tightening grip: "**Wait!…It's not what you-**"
His words are cut short as a dagger flies over Kadron's shoulder and sinks deep into the man's chest. Turning, Kadron can see another silohuette approaching calmly. It's hard to see details in the dark, but a raspy voice addresses him clearly: "**Bandits. Liars and thieves, all of them. It's better than he deserved. But now to business…**" The figure, smaller in stature than Kadron and with a curious accent, withdraws a piece of paper and holds it out in front of him. His hand is green and scaly, with short claws and elongated fingers, reminding Kadron more of a lizard than any man.
"**I bring a message from your mother.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I'm going to just say that unless it's really pivotal combat or something, we'll let to first roll determine the encounter. Also, if this was a movie, this would be about two seconds from the title being flashed across the screen. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

Shocked and slightly disappointed he didn't get to finish the kill, Kadron tosses the limp body to the floor before turning around to face the approaching figure, who was spouting more of the common tongue. He stoops down as he continues to approach to pick up his dead adversary's weapon, never knowing what these *Po'djina* might throw at him next.
*'Biz-niss?'* He thought to himself puzzled, before some parchment was presented to him. Warily, he snatched it out of the claws of the messenger, only to have his suspicions heighten at the mention of his mother.
**"I killed mi madda, siinz men-ni men-ni *lounaa*!"** He says flexing his chest, not knowing how to express that he "killed" her during childbirth.
**"I not no wat *loudaa* you play, *Zerqa*! Bat, I khwill plae fur nau!"**" He boomed as he unfolded the paper.

Sorry about the lack of posting, I was in Barcelona for the long weekend ![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)
If you need a Kruydrolmiil or even "Common Tongue" translation of the above, gimme a shout.

"**Glad to hear it.**" The stranger kneels and nonchalantly begins searching the bandit's body, unafraid of use a small lantern of his own. Kadron unfolds the parchment, its edges worn with the passage of time, and reads the native Kruydrol script:
*My dearest son,
I cannot tell you how my heart breaks at the news that I now hear from the midwives - that I will likely never be able to hold you, to sing to you, to watch you grow into a man and lead our people. My sleep has been troubled of late and while I suspected evil things might be on the horizon I never imagined it would mean this. You'll be here soon, within days, and there's not much time. Your father doesn't know, I think the burden would be too much - but preparations have been made. All will be explained in time. For now, know that you can trust the bearer of this message with your life. There are many dangers ahead, and many victories, but you shall have all that I can muster for you - and do not discount your heritage. You are Ser'ath, heir to the Kruydrol, son of the Qasiir and harbinger of the Ugezii. Your enemies may be as numerous as the sands of the Kruydrolina but you shall crush them underfoot like so much dust. Where you lead, others will follow. You have the strength of the tribe, the blessing of the gods, and a mother's love - what more could one need?*"
Kadron's family seal has been inscribed along the bottom, beneath his mother's full signature.

I can usually figure out what you mean, so that's cool. I hope that sounds like something a mother would write - I have to reach more for inspiration for some of my NPCs than others... ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)
