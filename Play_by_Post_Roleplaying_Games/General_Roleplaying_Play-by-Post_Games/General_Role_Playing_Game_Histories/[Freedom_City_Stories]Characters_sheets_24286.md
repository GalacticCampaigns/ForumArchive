<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Description**</span>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

At 6'3'' and 200 lbs, Adonis holds to his namesake as a picture of human perfection. Curly, raven-haired locks crown his head in a roguishly unruly mop, and obscure his light grey eyes when he's not brushing it out of the way. Olive complected and with a chiseled jaw, Adonis is a bit of a heart-throb on the Claremont Academy campus.
But if Adonis were aware of his exotic good looks, he does an excellent job of playing oblivious. Indeed, it seems that the few times that Adonis is truly within his element is within the heat of competition. He excels at everything athletic at Claremont Academy, and while it is rumored Freedom City University has thrown every possible offer in the book at him, the Claremont senior seems intent on attending Freedom College, much to the delight of FC alumni the world over.
A mysterious tattoo appears on Adonis's neck under ultra-violet light. It resembles a barcode, and beneath it is the designation "Perfection_001".

**Personality**</span>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Quiet, direct and decisive, Adonis is the quintessential soldier, even if he doesn't overtly know it. While his personality is still developing, Adonis has shown a great thirst for competition and proving himself. When not competing in some athletic competition or another, Adonis tends to sequester himself in the Claremont Academy mechanics bay to work on his motorcycle, or in his room at his parents house in the Theater District.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Background**</span>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Specimen designation Perfection_001 was found in a cryogenic stasis chamber during a raid on the SHADOW organization by the Freedom League. The specimen appeared to be in late adolescence, but exhibited a physiology far in advanced of most children of that age. While exceptionally functional in a cognitive fashion, the specimen had almost a pure blank slate for a personality, and no memory of a past beyond extremely intense training and experimentation at the hands of the Overshadow. Further investigation uncovered that Perfection_001 was the first successful test subject in an experiment meant to breed the perfect soldier for SHADOW's operations around the world, and possibly as a future host body for the Overshadow should the specimen prove worthy enough.
Lady Liberty, in her infinite compassion, decided to adopt the young man and took him home. The Wright family had been discussing having children for quite some time, but Adonis's addition to their household would prove a blessing and a curse. While the Wright's were spared many of the pitfalls of having to raise a child from birth to teenager, the emergence of Adonis's latent metahuman abilities, and his overtly aggressive and sometimes violent behavior threatened to separate Elizabeth Walton and Trevor Wright for good.
It was Adonis's enrollment at the Claremont Academy that saved the Wright's marriage, and their sanity. Under the steady hand and watchful eye of Duncan Summers and the Academy's superpowered faculty, Adonis has slowly been able to grow into being an actual teenager, even though the rough edge of his indoctrination remains. And while the brilliant student and faculty scientists of Claremont Academy have been unable to find a solution to Adonis's addiction to the Penumbral substance, they have been able to replicate it, helping to prevent the teenagers violent withdrawals.
Adonis goes by the alias "Perfection", in reference to the designation tattooed on his neck. While not overly altruistic, Perfection lives for the thrill of combat afforded by crime-fighting. Mostly keeping to himself, he has on occasion worked with Next-Gen, and very rarely his adopted mother Lady Liberty. Despite his incredible physique and superhuman abilities, Elizabeth and Trevor Wright still have an intense worry for their adopted son's future, and both remain ever vigilant for SHADOW's insidious hand.

</details>

Background
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Garrif was a normal child. He enjoyed all the joys and presuits that all other children his age enjoyed. He also had his chores to carry out for his single mother. He learned at a young age the results if these chores weren't completed. The family went cold for the night, or hungry. It varied. If Garrif didn't go out into the woods near his house and gather kindling and firewood, they might not survive the night's cold. If he didn't go and draw water from the stream, they might not have drinking water or cooking water (bathing was usually a summer time joy). If he didn't go and collect seeds during the fall and winter, then they wouldn't have enough crops the next season to see them through the year, not to mention paying off their debts to Lord Kager for the farm. And Garrif had seen enough times how Lord Kager extracted his debts when money was scarce.
So, Garrif worked hard as a child and all seemed to go well for the family. Then he turned twelve years old. On the twelfth day after his twelfth birthday, at the twelfth minute of the twelfth hour, it happened. Garrif was walking along in the woods, returning to his home from collecting kindling, and then he wasn't. He found himself in a large room, filled with more books than he'd seen in his entire life. Stunned at where he was, Garrif turned around and saw someone else in the room, next to the fireplace. The man was standing in a circle drawn on the floor. He seemed to have just finished chanting something. Garrif wondered who this man was, and if he had anything to do with the sudden movement, but he had a feeling in his gut that the old man had somehow pulled him from the woods and into this room.
As Garrif pondered all of these revelations, the old man opened his eyes and looked at the young boy. "Boy," he began. "My name is Zorozk. And, you are Garrif. I have waited quite some time for this moment, the moment when you were no longer protected. The moment when you were at your most vulnerable."
Garrif's eyes went wide in fear. This man was saying something about Garrif being vulnerable, easy to kill. Did he want to kill Garrif? Even with this fear, Garrif stood his ground to the old man. The old man must have liked that, because he smiled. "Good, boy. You do not yield, even though you are afraid that I will kill you." Garrif blinked for a moment. Did the old man just read his thoughts?
Zorozk smiled again. "Yes, I did read your thoughts, boy. They weren't hard for me to fathom from your head. But, that is not why I brought you hear." With this, the old man stepped over the circle on the floor and walked to a table near the fireplace and picked up a book. "I have watched you for a long time, Garrif. On the day of your birth, I cast a spell on you. A spell that would protect you for twelve years. And, for twelve years, your father hasn't been able to find you or touch you. But now, the spell has collapsed, and your father has begun looking for you again. He's probably begun by looking for your mother."
Garrif realized what that meant. Whoever his father was, he wanted bad things. He didn't know how he knew it, but he did. And that meant that his mother was in trouble. Without thinking, Garrif turned aside, intent on running for home. It was all he could think about, getting home. As he turned, he found himself in the clearing outside his house. Not sure how he got there, but intent on protecting his mother, Garrif made to run for the house, only to find his arms and legs bound together by an invisible force.
Falling on his face, Garrif rolled to the side and saw Zorozk standing over him, with a sad, apologetic look on his face. The old man helped Garrif to his feet, which still wouldn't move. Turning his head, he saw a fire break out in his house. He knew instinctively that his mother was still in there. That she would die in there. He made to scream, but found his voice wouldn't respond. He watched in horror as a tall figure with burning read eyes and golden skin, came walking out of the house, anger apparent in his stride. The boy began to cry as he realized that he was back in the book room again.
He was placed in a chair as he began crying over the death of his mother. Zorozk took care of Garrif for some time after that. He taught Garrif that he wasn't a normal boy with a normal heritage. Garrif was a half-breed. His mother, rest her soul, was human, through and through, but his father. That was a different story. His father was a demon. And, not just any demon. His father was The Ragetear, a demon general in charge of the Armies of Chaos. Apparently, Ragetear had seduced Garrif's mother with magic twelve years before, intent on producing a half-breed who could control the powers of the demons and yet exist in the world of the humans indefinitely. Demons, it turned out, could only exist in the human world in fits and spurts before they were forcibly yanked back to their own realm. Garrif was gifted or cursed (point of view) with the powers of his father. Ragetear had wanted to train the boy to be his second, to lead the Armies of Chaos in conquering the world.
Zorozk had taken it upon himself to protect the boy and train him in the ways of magic. To train him to protect himself. The castle where Garrif currently was located in was protected permanently. The demons would never enter here. Here, Garrif could learn in safety. And learn he did. He made it his mission to learn what he could and to destroy his father. He intended to avenge his sweet mother and to do what needed to be done.
Time passed, quite a bit of it, actually, and Garrif grew into a man. He grew confident in his abilities, too confident. He left the protection of the castle, one day, intent on tracking down his father and killing him. Well, his father found him, and the battle went poorly from the get go. Ragetear was killing his son, and didn't care. He even laughed at Garrif, telling him that another child was not that hard to come by way anyway. That within enough time, he would find another woman to seduce, and their demon spawn would conquer the world. And this time, no one would stop him.
As Garrif was drawing what he was sure would be his last breath, there was a flash of light, and then darkness. Unbeknowst to Garrif, Zorozk had arrived in time to place Garrif in suspended animation in an alternate dimension and had turned to face Ragetear himself.
Garrif awoke from the suspended animation in Freedom City around the 1930's. He realized that he'd failed in his quest, but could begin again. The demon had obviously not found his new lover yet, especially because the world was not destroyed yet. So, he set out to discover what he could about this new world, and to find and kill his father.
So Garrif began searching the world for traces of his demonic father, signs and clues as to where he was going to try again to seed a half-blood demon, but he never found any. Garrif began to wonder whether or not Zorozk had won that final battle nearly four-hundred years previous. Having no luck in tracking down The Ragetear, Garrif began trying to live and adapt to the new world he found himself in. He had a few adventures with the Freedom Society, but after the assault of Omega, Lord of the Terminus on Freedom City, and the death of The Centurion, not to mention the disbanding of the Freedom Society, Garrif found it easier to try and live a normal life.
He settled down in Freedom City, joined the Protestant Church, and became a pastor. He felt that this way, he could continue to help people in this new day, in their new way. He bought a small home on the outskirts of Freedom City, and settled down for a normal, pedestrian life. He fell in love for the first time in nearly four-hundred years. A member of his congregation caught his eye, and he began to court her. The year was 1942, and the girl's name was Cindy. Garrif had been using a glamor spell to hide his burning red eyes from people, so that they wouldn't be scared, but after months of dating Cindy, he decided to pop the question. However, he felt that she should know everything there was to know about him before having to consider the proposal.
So, one night after a date, the pair walked along the riverbank, holding hands, looking at the moon. Garrif looked into Cindy's eyes, "Cindy, I have something I want to ask you." Cindy's breath caught in her throat as she realized where this was going. "However," Garrif continued, "I want you to know everything there is about me before I ask you that question. It's right that you should know something I've hidden from the rest of the world now for nearly twenty years."
Cindy looked in confusion. "Twenty years? What are you talking about? You're twenty-seven years old. What horrible thing have you been hiding since you were seven?" Garrif took Cindy's hands and looked into her eyes. "I'm not twenty-seven years old. I'm actually three-hundred and eighty years old." Garrif saw the look of disbelief in Cindy's eyes. She had thought the whole thing a joke. Still, he pressed on. "Cindy, I want to tell you these things so that you know who you've fallen in love with. I am truthfully three-hundred and eighty years old. I'm not human. Well, at least not completely. My mother was human. She died nearly three-hundred and sixty-eight years ago at the hands of my father. My father was a demon."
As Cindy's look of disbelief began to show that she was now concerned to be around this man she loved who'd obviously gone insane, he held her hand tighter, ensuring that she didn't run away. He passed his free hand over his eyes, revealing their true color, blood red. Cindy gasped and backed away as fast as she could, but Garrif wouldn't let her go. "I won't harm you, Cindy. You should know that by now." Cindy, still speechless, simply nodded. Garrif continued. "I wanted you to know the truth. I want to marry you, have a family with you, but I can't do the last part that all couples do. I can't grow old with you. I never will. I've looked this way since I was in my mid-twenties. That was nearly three-hundred and fifty years ago. I haven't changed since then. As far as I know, I'll never grow old, and I'll never die. I don't even know if we can have kids, but I want to spend the next lifetime with you. However, I completely understand if you say no. It would be very weird for you, I know."
As Garrif backed away to give Cindy her space, she rushed into his arms and kissed him on the lips (a very bold move for a woman in those days). The wedding was done by another pastor from church, and the couple moved into Garrif's home on the outskirts of town. It was really surprising for Cindy when she was carried across the threshold for the first time. She was carried into a small townhouse, not too shabby, and actually entered a mansion the size of which she'd never seen before. Garrif set her down and she smiled at him. Of course her half-demon husband, who was a practicing mage as well as a Protestant Pastor, would have a mansion for a home.
The next twenty years were beautiful. Garrif and Cindy had a beautiful baby girl, named Laura, who grew up in the mansion with her family. At her birth, Garrif performed the ritual of protection, just in case, but later discovered a lack signs that would have indicated her being part-demon as well. It had seemed to skip the girl. As Laura grew, she came to understand the secret of her father, and also made certain to tell no one. Laura missed out on a few of the things of childhood. She never had sleepovers at her house, she never had friends over. After all, what would she tell them? *Welcome to my mansion crammed into a house.* No, that wouldn't do.
As Laura grew up and moved off to college during the 1960's, she determined that her children wouldn't have to put up with those problems of their lineage. She moved away from her parents, and met a wonderful man (Garrif would've killed anyone less worthy of his daughter) whom she married. They had a son, who Laura taught that her grandfather, a pastor named Garrif, had passed away years ago, leaving only Grandma Cindy to come for visits. The boy, Scott, grew up to be a fine boy, and also missing the lineage of his grandfather. Garrif breathed a sigh of relief. Maybe he would be the only one to draw a demon's notice.
However, in the 1980's, Scott's first born child, his daughter named Aurora (or Rory to her friends), gave Garrif pause to think. At the time of her birth, their was a huge electrical storm over the hospital. Garrif had been in the hospital, to cast the protection spell as he'd done for Laura and Scott. He felt the disturbances in the air. It seemed to crackle with power and raw energy. As Garrif stood away from the family that didn't know him anymore, he new what was happening. Aurora was receiving his heritage. She would be different. She would have the lineage that he himself carried. Garrif quickly cast the protection ritual in an empty room, scaring the janitors who cleaned it up later (nothing like finding red paintings of the pentagram and various other symbols on the floor of a Catholic hospital to scare the nuns). He knew that she would need protecting. He knew that she would one day need training.
After Rory's birth, Garrif began to look more seriously at any weather anomaly that cropped up. Any cattle mutilation that was passed off as the work of teenagers with too much time on their hands, every time a thief or murderer would claim "The devil made me do it", all of it was looked in earnest. Garrif knew what was coming. The Ragetear had survived, he was sure, and was trying to make a bid for young Rory. Garrif began to visit his family more and more with his wife, now in her 90th year and still kicking (after all, what's the point of having powers if you can't save your loved ones). Cindy simply told everyone who didn't know (meaning everyone except for Laura) that Garrif was her pastor from home who simply looked in on her and drove her around in her old age. A few magical words lent credence to the belief and no one questioned it or thought granny was getting frisky in her old age. None of that.
At Rory's twelfth birthday at Laura's house (a clever deception), Laura showed Garrif a private room where he could begin the protection ritual. On the twelfth hour at the twelfth minute, Garrif began casting, knowing that this would give Rory a little more time of protection and normalcy before she lost her life to training for her own protection. Problem was, a few scavenger demons had managed to track Garrif to the house and they attacked with ferocity. To everyone else, it seemed that a whirlwind had descended on the home with no mercy. Things were flying every which way, knocking people to the ground. Rory began to scream as she felt things grabbing at her hair and clothes, trying to carry her away. Cindy, in her mid nineties, stood to the demons she knew were there and swung her cane for all it was worth.
Naturally, the cane did no damage to the ethereal demons, but it distracted them long enough for Garrif to finish casting the ritual. At the final word, the whirlwind stopped instantly. Garrif exited the back room and saw the destruction. He hadn't expected them to show up so quickly and in such force. Garrif's musings were stopped, however, when he saw his own wife of seventy years, dead on the floor, with young Rory crying next to her. Garrif stood in disbelief as the anger welled up inside of him. He'd forgotten what this kind of rage felt like. He'd lived in peace for so long, he'd nearly forgotten what he was, and what his mission was. Had the demons waited another twenty, or maybe hundred years, Garrif would have dwindled in power and mental fortitude to the point where he wouldn't have been a threat any more.
But they didn't wait. And, that was their mistake. With his great-granddaughter protected, Garrif buried his wife, casting protection charms on the grave to ensure the demons didn't get to her corpse, and hid himself in his home. He summoned golems to keep it clean, and to make his meals. He buried himself in his library, re-learning lost truths, and discovering new ones. He continued to grow in power and strength, knowing that soon enough, Rory would need to learn how to defend herself, and he would have to be ready.
He also had one other thing to do. Find The Ragetear, ... and kill him. This time, he wouldn't fail. He wouldn't stop till he'd succeeded. Nothing would stop him. Nothing.

**Complications**:
Grey Area: Walking the line between Light and Shadow, stalking those who use the night as their cover - Nighthawk does not have the best of reputations. The Police do not even recognize that Nighthawk exists, even if some do work with her, while Nighthawk is the sort of 'superhero' that the Media loves to villainize because she will not stand and take pictures for them.
Responsibility: Being a college student, free-lance photographer, care-giver and crime-fighter takes up a lot of your time. Jennifer is often run ragged, and finds very little time to socialize, despite her desire to. It doesn't help that Poppops is the ONE running her ragged.
Not My Car!: Be it bad luck, bad parking, bad timing - Jennifer manages to park her car in JUST the wrong place at the wrong time. Insurance has refused to pay for any more repairs from criminal incidents and damages where Jennifer has been 'covering' a scene. It is not uncommon for Jennifer's paycheck to go to some repair, be it new tires after the old were shot out, or a window replaced after a brick fell through it, or the one time a man was knocked onto the hood of her car. Jennifer is really regretting kicking him so hard that time.
**Languages**: English
**Totals**: Abilities 48 + Skills 21 (84 ranks) + Feats 12 + Powers 24 + Combat 20 + Saves 0 - Drawbacks 5 = 120
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Contacts Info</span>**:
Jennifer has three areas of contacts. Two she 'inherited' from Requiter when he thought she was ready, and began slowly working with them. And one she has worked and developed completely on her own.
**Intelligence**:
In some careers, it is a family choice. The CIA and Military have a tendency, at times, to be the same way - Children and grandchildren making their career choices and following in the footsteps of their ancestors. After all, Jennifer is doing the same thing. Massaging the works, Jennifer was able to make a sort of rapport with an up and coming CIA analyst - James Bradley. The connection was first made pointing out Vindicator's work for the OSS and Requiter's work for the CIA, exposing the family heritage to the man, who then reciprocated it by giving Nighthawk some information on a minor home-grown terrorist cell - a group of young kids looking to lash out at the system. After Nighthawk was able to bring them down, and aide in their arrests, without even hinting at Bradley's involvement, a trust grew and has been growing - neither has let the other down ... yet.
**Military**:
Within the military there are a few people who see the necessary of dark operatives. Colonel LaVar Rasmussen, working as an Under Secretary for the Joint Chiefs is one of these men. Someone that Jennifer knows in her civilian identity, though she has tried not to let the man know. A friend of her grandfather's nearing retirement, Nighthawk came to the man with information she had uncovered during an operation against the same 'terrorists' that Bradley pointed her to. What Jennifer doesn't know, is the Rasmussen and Requiter worked together often, sharing information, and that the man knows very well who Jennifer is, but he humors her.
**Media**:
Now, Jennifer has been working since arriving at FCU as a freelance photographer. This has allowed her to make a few contacts within the Press. Especially one of the 'investigative' reports at a major paper in town. While Sandy McDiermot's openly one of the most anti-meta writers at the paper, secretly metahumans fascinate her. Jennifer was able to get Sandy some rather good shots of a meta-human battle during her Sophomore year, and now Sandy tries to use Jennifer's pictures as often as possible. And thinking she's being 'kind' to Jennifer, shares a few angles and leads she's uncovered in her own work. And since Jennifer hasn't shown an interest in scooping Sandy, or even actually writing at the paper, where's the harm, mmm?

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Nothing really marks out this man as different. Sure his looks are striking: with his well-built 6'2 frame he could easily be an athlete, and his white-blonde hair and blue eyes compliment his well-defined features in a way that is nothing less than attractive. But that's just "good looking", not "different".
There are probably logical reasons for the tiredness around his eyes. Sleep issues are pretty common. As for his clothes... well, most people don't walk around in tattered jackets, certainly, but maybe they're the only clean clothes he had to wear today. And the limp... Well, you've already pegged him as an athlete, right? Probably just a sports injury. Yeah, that'll be it.
Nothing unusual about this guy at all...

</details>

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Background:</span>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The hellfire blade lances through the daemon's flesh, bringing its mockery of life to a shrieking end. Ricky swings the scythe of dark energy around and fires a blast that consumes the monstrosities coming up behind him.
In the aftermath, Ricky stands alone in the dilapidated tenement, the remains of the unholy beasts crumbling into nothingness around him. The black hellfire scythe diminishes in his hands until it is gone together and there is nothing to mark him as anything more than a normal person—save his tattered clothing and the raking wounds across his torso and thighs.
No time to rest. Mastema has found him, it's no longer safe here.
He gathers up his meagre possessions and rushes out the door into a dark street lit only by a single flickering street lamp, the others having long since given up the ghost. A momentary pause outside of Luigi's café. Had that been a flicker of movement behind him reflected in the window? No. His senses would have told him by now.
*Do you trust them with your life?*
He takes a quick look back. There's nothing there but the sporadic bursts of light. As Ricky watches, the street lamp flickers off again,then hums back to momentary life. For the brief moment of illumination, he sees a dark figure.
*Run.*
His legs start moving; his abilities mean nothing right now. Sure he can fight them, but for how long? Survival is the name of this game, and he needs every edge he can get. By running he could be playing into their hands but he's not frightened, not truly, not yet. Ricky has felt the truest depths of terror before, and it will take a lot to send him back into those unfathomable waters again. Without fear, with reason, he can do this.
As he pounds a trail down the street in the direction of more civilised parts—*will they dare attack him there?*—he reflects on how he got into this sorry mess.
-------
*One day you're just a kid, late teen, good at school and good in life. Go to church, well, go to church as often as any kid can be expected to. Then all of a sudden your world is turned upside down while still staying right way round: Because there is a God, and one of angels decides to pay you a visit. Archangel Michael no less, what an honour! A short conversation about destiny later and you find yourself the wielder of holy powers, a champion of Michael against his eternal foe Lucifer.
Baby steps. You're practically a superhero now, though not an alien or mutant or anything like in the comics. Or any of the heroes on the news. No, you're different. You're nothing less than a holy crusader in a war against primal Evils. No pressure, right?
Baby steps. You've gotta take it slow. You've just gotta go out there and do it. How do you find Evil, you think? Turns out it's not as hard as all that, since Michael equipped you with more than weapons. You can sense the good and evil around you, and that person right there isn't right. Follow them. See what they're up to.
Baby steps. Damn, you're not a thief, what were you thinking trying to sneak after a daemon? He's coming for you, oh my God, look at those eyes ! Stay calm, stay calm! Time to test out the power—He told me it would come instinctively. It does. White, searing energy launches forth from my hand, forming a kind of blade. The daemon fears it, tries to run. You hold up your arm and flex the hand, and a blast of the holy power launches forth, incinerating the creature.
Don't ever think even for a minute that just getting powers is enough to make you a superhero. It's hard work making it all fall into place. Baby steps, that's the key. And getting over the fear. That's the hardest. I don't think it's possible to ever truly jump that particular hurdle. Each time you clear it, the bar just gets higher and the stakes greater.
It's those times, the sink or swim times, when baby steps just aren't enough.*
-------
A clattering from a nearby alley rouses Ricky from his thoughts—someone on the fire escape? He can't risk flinging hellfire into the alley in case it's someone in the wrong place at the wrong time. He puts on an extra turn of speed and runs left at the next intersection. As on the last road, all the lights here seem to be out. Wait, no—two lights, coming up the road. A car!
Ricky keeps running along the road. What are the chances of it being just some guy in a car right now? Slim. The car doesn't stop, confirming his suspicions. Though it's hard to tell through the glare of the headlights, there doesn't appear to be anyone behind the wheel.
He veers to the side almost at the last minute, his scythe of hellfire appearing from his hands and slashing through the vehicle's tyres. He doesn't stop to watch the carnage after he passes, though smiles with grim satisfaction as he hears the almighty crash of it smashing into a parked vehicle. An alarm pierces the night air.
-------
*It's one of those sink or swim times, and Ricky sinks.
He had met Laurie in a bar one night, and they'd got on like a house on fire. He'd bought her a drink, one thing had led to another, and they met up the next evening, then the following day. Before he really knew what was happening they were in a relationship and Ricky was falling in love with this wonderful woman. It all seemed too perfect, and it was.
She follows him tonight, and sees it all—his fight with a gang of daemon kind, the hidden truth of the world and the secret of his divinely gifted powers. Not only does she see it, but the daemons see her. Before Ricky even knows what's happening they are on top of her, tearing into her flesh with jagged tooth and vile claw.
By the time he fights them off, she is long dead. He falls to his knees beside her and weeps.
'Where is your God now?'
The speaker leans against a nearby wall, a beautiful being â€“ not quite man, though more so than woman—similar to the one he met before, the Archangel Michael. This is definitely not the same angel, though. He has darker skin, hair, and eyes, and an expression one wouldn't imagine ever being made by such a countenance. Try as he might, Ricky cannot get a sense of who this being is, whether he is angel or truly daemon. Whatever the case, their presence is calming—it may well prove to be deceptively so, but at least Ricky is no longer crying. His mind is numb, but he can reason.
'Who are you?' He asks, wiping the tears from his cheeks.
'I am known as Mastema,' the being replies, â€˜and I come here with an offer for you. I can bring this girl back.'
'And what do I have to do?' Ricky replies. He already knows he's willing to do anything to save the woman he loves.
'You will switch your allegiance, and serve me.'
'Fine.' Even though he knew he would, the rapidity of his own reply still comes as a surprise. 'I will serve you. Just bring her back to me.'
'Your allegiance is changed. Your powers stem from me now.'
As instinctively as Ricky uses his powers, he feels the change within himself and knows Mastema's words to be true—The Darkness always inside, always crushed by his conscience, seems to swell. Almost as strong is the sense of overwhelming disappointment that engulfs him.
'Yes Michael.' Mastema says with a grim smile. 'You've lost another one. The next time you see him, you'll be delivering him to his final judgement.'
Ricky doesn't care. Laurie is healed, and she is sitting up. She smiles.
'Laurie!' Ricky begins. She silences him with a finger to his lips.
'Save it, Ricky. What we had wasn't real.'
'What? Laurie…?'
Laurie laughs, cold and scathing. Her disguise is lifted and Ricky sees her for who she is; just another daemon bent on harming him, cunning enough to come in attractive form. How did she cloud his senses? Of course, Mastema can do the same. This is all his doing.
Rage bubbles up within Ricky but he is unable to act. His powers are those Mastema deems to give him now. They cannot be turned on him.
Mastema joins in Laurie's laughter. Ricky stands there, hands clenched, eyes downcast. With each harsh outburst, he feels as though he dies a little more inside.
When the laughter stops he looks up. They are gone.*
-------
He's near the edge of their power now, he can feel it. They'll attack in numbers, anything to stop him from reaching the Light. He heads right at the next intersection, and there they are, waiting for him. Dozens of horrific, unreal forms with bright hungry eyes, ready to tear him limb from limb.
Ricky brings forth the unholy energy from within. Each time he has to do so it feels like it costs him something more. Nothing tangible, nothing "real". But he feels it nonetheless.
The blade forms in his hand and he brings the arm up, palm towards the daemons.
Shrieking in anticipation of the kill, they rush along the abandoned road towards him.
Ricky unleashes his power upon them. If he weren't so damned concerned for his continuing life, so important for redeeming his soul, he'd find the whole thing cathartic.
-------
*Like Michael's visitation, the next occurs in his dreams. Again like the last, there's no doubt in Ricky's mind that it's real. It shares that indefinable quality of the waking world that ties us so closely to it that we know when we open our eyes each morning that we're no longer dreaming, that this, at this place and time, is where we're meant to be.
The figure that appears to him looks every bit as angelic as Michael, with sun-blonde hair and a radiant smile. His blue eyes seem to draw Ricky in, and it is impossible to hate him, even though there is no doubt in Ricky's mind of who this entity is. The smug, predatory nature of his smile is clue enough.
'Lucifer.' He says flatly.
'Some know me by that name.' The being acknowledges with an easy grin.
'What do you want from me?'
'I want to make you an offer, Ricky.' He begins, then pauses to laugh at the young man's expression. 'You will like it better than the last you were given, I promise. Mastema is no friend of mine, I would help you help me.'
'How? And why should that appeal to me?' Ricky asks, still suspicious.
'You cannot use your powers against Mastema and his kin.' Lucifer explains, smile growing wider. 'He owns you. I will grant you the ability to turn your powers on Mastema, no strings attached. It will be payment enough that you give him—if you'll excuse the expression Hell.'
Lucifer smirks, and stand there, waiting for Ricky's reply.
'No strings attached?' Ricky says slowly, uncertain.
'Mastema will be furious that you've escaped his influence, and you will forever be his enemy. He will hunt you. But at this stage you've betrayed the trust of God—how much more trouble can you really be in? For my part, I expect nothing more than for you to fight back. Face it Ricky, you're so steeped in Sin now that accepting my help to fight Mastema changes nothing, it just gives you an edge that you need if you want even the slightest chance to be free, and one day redeem your soul.'
What else can Ricky say to this?
'I accept.'*
-------
Ricky's chest heaves as he breathes heavily from exertion. His body glistens with sweat, and he sways woozily from the combined effects of blood loss and slowing down long enough for his adrenaline rush to fade. He staggers forward from the darkened street into the next, where the lamps work and light shines from some of the windows on either side of the road.
He is safe, for now. He stops long enough to roughly bind his wounds, then staggers to the nearest phone booth and rings for an ambulance.
Slumping against the glass, he rolls his head back.
A man walks past on the outside. He doesn't stop, but he does turn to give Ricky a smile—a smug, predatory smile.

</details>

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Significant NPCs:</span>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**"LAURIE"—**A Masteman daemon who tempted Ricky to sin. Though he would dearly love to destroy her, he has not had a chance since her unveiling.
**LUCIFER—**Lord of Flies and Prince of Daemons, Lucifer is the undisputed ruler of Hell. Once an Archangel, he was promoted to Cherubim thanks to his power, and subsequently led a rebellion of an angelic host against God and his loyal angels. In the aftermath they were banished to Hell, where Lucifer now rules, all except for Mastema and his minions. There is no love lost between the two, and when Ricky refused to honour his bargain with Mastema it was Lucifer arranged for Ricky to retain his dark powers to vex his long-time rival.
**MASTEMA—**Leader of Fallen Angels, a Seraphim who demanded and received the right to dwell in the realm of men rather than Hell. He kept roughly ten percent of the fallen angels with him, while the other ninety accompanied Lucifer to hell. As a Seraphim, Mastema is roughly on par with Lucifer in terms of personal power, if not more powerful. Mastema loves to kill, and is not picky about who his victims are.
He and his daemons ("Masteman Daemons") dwell on Earth and answer directly to God rather than being under the power of Lucifer, tasked as they are to tempt men to sin, testing the morality of mortals by any means they deem appropriate. They deem any means appropriate, though they do not usually initiate corruption, instead basing their tricks and tests on existing Sins, however small.
It is also Mastema's duty to catalogue the Sins of mortals before the gates of Heaven. He is, in essence, the offence lawyer to Michael's judge, and it is a role he enjoys immensely.
**MASTEMA, CULT OF—**Though not all mortals corrupted by Mastema belong to this cult, the most depraved, perverted sinners end up within its ranks. Some of its highest ranking members have even had visitations from Masteman daemons, though it is unlikely Mastema himself makes time for these most worthless and damned of his minions.
**MASTEMAN DAEMONS/MASTEMANS—**The agents of Mastema on Earth, these daemons are born from the couplings of fallen angels and mortal women. Masteman Daemons may well be the same entities as the Nephilim.
**MICHAEL, ARCHANGEL—**Appears as a man with a sword in his hand, captain of the Lord's Host. He cast Lucifer out of Heaven, and when judgement day comes it his duty to face the Devil in battle more. He provides spiritual and physical protection and is pivotal to the proper expression of power and leadership. His wings are conspicuous and grand, golden in colour.
His four charges are: Fight Satan in all guises; Rescue souls of the faithful; To be champion of God's people; To call souls to judgement
There is a day named in his honour, Michaelmas, the 29th of September.
**NEPHILIM—**A people created by the crossbreeding of angels and mortal women, said to be giants. Thanks to the creation of the Nephilim, God dictated that his Spirit would not abide in the flesh of Man forever, limiting our life spans to a maximum of 120 years.

</details>

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Complications:</span>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

* **Benefactor (Lucifer)—** for the time being, Lucifer is on Ricky's side. He has given Ricky some of his own power in order that he can fight Mastema. He is conscious, however, that by the same token the power of Mastema Ricky possesses can be turned on him. Still, his own personal safety is hardly in jeopardy, and if Ricky destroys a few of his minions in his zeal for redemption it can be seen as a small price to pay for the damage Ricky does to Mastema. Should Ricky not live up to his part of the bargain, Lucifer may wish to find ways to encourage him.
* **[Betrayed Benefactor (Michael)—** the Archangel Michael has not wholly given up on Ricky, though his disappointment has led him to cut off contact with his erstwhile agent. He watches still, however, and waits. He sees Ricky is attempting to atone, and may choose to test him.
* **Enemy (Mastema and his daemons)—** by making a second pact with Lucifer, Ricky exploited a loophole in his contract with Mastema. To add insult to injury, he still siphons at least part of his power from Mastema. This will only be undone when Ricky is dead.
* **Obsession (Redemption)—** Ricky knows there is a Heaven, and he knows that's he's currently destined to go to the *other place*. He is desperate to win back the right to step through Heaven's gates. He is only slightly less obsessed with foiling the machinations of Mastema, believing that if he saves enough souls from the Earth-bound daemon who orchestrated his own corruption, he will somehow prove himself to Archangel Michael.
* **Secret (Divine Powers)—** Ricky doesn't want to be carted off to the crazy house, and he doesn't want anyone hurt because of him (though Laurie turned out to be a daemon, watching her die still drove the potential dangers home). He doesn't make connections easily, and when he does is as careful as he can be not to reveal his powers if possible.[/list:u:qpjdn2gf]

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">History</span>**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Davis Brackis Mathom III was born with the name JS 3 and was the third in the Blessed Light community. Originally, the community was a isolationist offshoot of a Christian religion, willing living apart from the rest the 'decaying' society that was surely bound for the darker regions of the afterlife. But five years before Davis was born, the accepted Martin Lopez into the ranks, ignorant of his villainous title, Dark Mind. Within a year, the cult went from having basically good intentions to warped puppets that danced to the Dark Mind's melody. The rest of the world, kept at an arm's length from the cult, never knew what was brewing behind the walls of secrecy.
Dark Mind's multitude of plots and machinations were many, complex, layered, and only a few required the Blessed Light. One of those projects was forced breeding and genetic manipulation, possibly to create a prodigy fate would never grant the sinister telepath. JS 3 and his twenty-five brothers were the result of third attempt of five, and was the most successful. JS 3 was born hearing the thoughts of those around him and never knew a moment's peace. He and his brothers trained under Hard Drive, another telepath with technological based powers, excelling in most areas. But despite the combined ambitions of both evil mentalists, not a single psychic child had any physical powers, sure as flight, telekinesis, or flame projection. It was Hard Drive's idea that solved that problem.
Combining his super technology with the younglings' mental abilities gave Dark Mind the creations he wanted, if not nearly as subtle as he would have wished. With his small army nearly fully trained and brain washed, Dark Mind was on the verge of letting loose his master plan. This was thwarted by the intervention of the Centurion and fellow heroes, who tore through the enclave and shattered the mental army. While most of Dark Mind's army was brought into custody (and later, rehabilitation)- including Hard Drive, a full third escaped in the ensuing chaos. JS 3 and a small collection of his brothers found their way to Freedom City, and struggled to make their way. Most were too free with their powers and were picked up by the heroes (and sometimes villains) of the city. JS 3 was one of the few that reached adulthood without attracting the notice of the local law enforcement or criminal elements.
That was not to say he wasn't busy. JS 3 suffered through starvation and homelessness for the bulk of his teenage years. He and his remaining brothers living in constant fear of being discovered and dragged away, and hid their powers. They relied on each other like a real family, sharing shelter, food, and everything else, using their powers as sparingly as they could to get by. Nevertheless, one by one, the brothers were were taken away by the police, the Freedom League, various criminal gangs, and sometimes, death, until at the age of 15, JS 3 was alone. It wasn't until he turned sixteen and he had his first brush with the law did JS 3 took hold of his destiny and began to make his own way.
He spent three days in jail for shop lifting, and spent them next to Britney "Light Hands" Charlie. She shared a similar situation, and was spending time in jail because she was caught stealing food to feed her 'family'- a collection of street kids she had 'adopted' over the years. But where JS 3 went deeper and deeper into hiding as each brother was stolen form him, she had fought tooth and nail to keep her loved ones close to her and fed. When he walked out of the jail, JS 3 had made up his mind, and set about changing his fate. He would find his family, and take them home.
He began to use his powers, a little at first, and then more, to first improve his place in the world, and then to elevate himself to a place he could make his goals a reality. He already knew that money would be needed, so he began started there. Telepathy and telekinesis got him the start up cash to begin investing, and mind reading corporate heads encourage those stocks to soar. Now, in his late twenties, now with a new identity and a small fortune, Davis Brackis Mathom III was ready to turn fully into finding his family. He had plenty to go on; he has been hearing hints and rumors of his family as he climbed the social ladder, but always lacked the ability and time to pursue them. Now, he was ready.
Powers Concept: technology backed telepathy. I'm thinking of subtle, possibly innate, mind reading (not big into mind control) as his primary ability. His telekinesis will be technologically based, through a combination of cybernetics and 'drones' that can fly, shoot off energy beams or TK blasts, provide a force field, and levitate things for him. His telepathy will likely extend to machines, and coupled with a super fast mind, he can access the internet and his bank account when needed. He might have some very minor morphing powers, allowing him to change his looks. His wealth I plan on being high enough he doesn't do super heroics for money, and he definitely doesn't seek fame.
He will primarily be a information gatherer, and support unit. He won't go toe to toe with anyone on the physical plane, but will handle the mental battles when he isn't aiding other combatants in one way or another. He doesn't wear tights (jeans and a button shirt is fine to fight super villains in. He'll bring his jacket if he needs a dashing, bad boy look), and keeps to the sidelines when ever he can.
Personality: He's a social chameleon, adjusting his persona to whatever the watcher is wants to see. His favorite guise is that of the dashing rogue, an upstart millionaire unimpressed by his own wealth. He can pull off the serious business man, shrewd plotter, layman-made-good, and criminal-gone-straight with equal skill, but all of these are fake. They conceal a driven creature determined to find his family and create a home for them to stay, free of the world that would- and does- abuse them. He also seeks to punish those that have taken advantage of his family, and is always on the look out for Hard Drive (who has escape prison, yet again).
He tends to be distant with people, hiding behind layers of false personalities and adopted character traits. As a telepath, he can read people very quickly, completely bypassing the need to waste 'getting to know' anyone. Davis has read too much darkness in too many books to completely avoid a cynical view of humanity, but keeps a positive outlook. He found dark secrets in many people, but he has also seen bright stars, not all of which wear capes and fly around on TV. So, while he maintains his distance, he still maintains hope.
Due to his upbringing, Davis is a sociopath, and lacks any true remorse for his actions (being created to function as a spy, assassin, and mental weapons platform does that). But he has been greatly influenced on the 'proper' way to use his abilities by Centurion and other heroes of Freedom city, experiencing first hand the awe the normal citizens of the city react to the supers. Like his mundane counterparts, he is awestruck by the most power and heroic of the superheroes, and tries to model himself after them, at least in regards to wrongdoing. Still, he is a mind reader on a mission, so isn't above taking a walk through some one's brain to discover secrets he needs to know.
Still, some part of his mind, he wonders about Dark Mind and the purpose of the Blessed Light. The villainous mastermind has never been caught, and his plots can take years if not decades to unfold. What if the brain washing isn't gone? What if Davis is doing exactly what he is programed to do? Davis fears his own actions, and worries about he's every success, always wondering there are strings tied to his creator's fingertips.
