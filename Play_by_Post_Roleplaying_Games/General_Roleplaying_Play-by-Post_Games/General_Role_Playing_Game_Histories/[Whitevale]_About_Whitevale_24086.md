# [Whitevale] About Whitevale

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-28 00:01:53)

The village of **Whitevale** has stood for about five centuries, probably longer. It is unique in that it is completely isolated from the rest of the world: it's farmlands are caged in by a wilderness full of evil creatures who know only hatred for the civilized peoples. Little is known about Whitevale's creation, or the state of the rest of the world, for that matter. Like their forefathers, the farmers and citizens that make up the community plan to live and die therein.
Society is divided into two main parts: the **farmers** and the **citizens**. The village proper, lying at the heart of Whitevale, is surrounded by the farmlands, which are in turn surrounded by the Forest. The farmers, as you can expect, raise a variety of crops and livestock, and providing for the village. The citizens, in turn, help protect the farmlands by serving in the village militia and watch the borders for threats. Most everyone is happy to do their party; danger is very real to Whitevale, and everyone knows their duties are important to the whole.
Nothing stands out about the racial variety in the village, either. Humans are the vast majority, with halflings and dwarves having their own substantial communities. The elven families (which are comprised of both eladrin and elves from the PHB) are relatively few, but tight-knit in the Fey Commune. The number of dragonborn families can probably be counted on one hand. Tieflings are the sole PHB race not present in Whitevale.
The **player characters** are all members of the village militia, having seen some light action, probably more than just standard watch duty. The majority of militiamen have trained in the School, which is probably the largest single structure in Whitevale. The School hosts a variety of training, from weapons practice to battlefield tactics to arcane studies. It also works with the Fey Commune and Church to sponsor students in specialized primal and divine practice. Also, the Whitevale Library contains a variety of old tomes, many of them written in a ancient language unknown to the villagers. They are considered little more than myths and legends now, though.

This is the overview map. The names represent the farming communities (houses) in the village. I'll be posting another map of a closeup of the village later. Also, I'll give details on the farming communities below.
EDIT: This map follows your modern compass orientation, i.e. the top of the image is North.

## The Farming Houses

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-01 01:29:34)

Whitevale is divided into eight farming houses, which provide the townspeople (and each other) with a variety of crops. The houses are not strictly blood-related families; they are more like clans. They are organized more cleanly along lines of race: the dwarven families almost never take in humans, and no other race particularly cares to join the halflings.
These are the houses, with notes concerning major race and particular crops:
[*]Drothem - Human  
[*]Linuhe - Half-elven  
[*]Alsenth - Human - Mostly cattle  
[*]Shander - Halfling  
[*]Elbereth - Fey - Various fruits  
[*]Syromet - Half-elven - Livestock  
[*]Ferroxanth - Dwarven - Wheat, hops, brewing crops  
[*]Belmark - Dwarven - Brewing crops.  
The two Dwarven clans also brew their own ales; this is the closest Whitevale has to business competition, as they are always trying to "out-brew" each other. (I'm not going to go into detail about what each house focuses on, because I really don't think any of you care for that level of detail. I could, but don't consider it accurate based on real-world agriculture economics.)

Ok, I really won't bother posting a closeup of the village map, but I'll just describe some points of interest.
The city is divided into four quadrants thanks to the two major roads running through the village: the North-South Heaven Road, and East-West Earth Road. The northwest quadrant is the Dwarven district: the major dwarven families live here in both above- and below-ground houses. The village's smiths have shops here, although not all of them are dwarven; the stout folk are pretty tolerant of the other races doing business amongst them, as long as they stay out of clan affairs. The south-west quadrant is the Fey Commune, which contrasts sharply with the neighboring Dwarven district. More than a few trees make up the gardens here, and a few elven houses are nestled in the trees themselves. The fey peoples are more tight-knit than the dwarves: people who do not have immediate business with residents are frowned upon strolling through the Fey Commune. Once a year, however, this stigma is lifted as the fey celebrate the Bright Festival; suffusing energy from the Feywild, this festival is a celebration of life and nature, of which the fey openly invite all the residents to partake of.
The remaining half of the village is an assortment of shops and homes, although a few important places should be mentioned. The School is located in the south-east quadrant, right at the intersection of Heaven and Earth. Its grounds (including the Library and training halls) make up at least half of this quadrant as well. The Church is located directly next to the School. Coincidentally, across from these buildings is Whitevale's single tavern, the Broken Blade. The name comes from an old legend about a powerful sword being shattered (or reforged, who knows?) at this very site. The tavern itself is a bit odd: Whitevale gets no travellers, so the Blade has only two guest-rooms. However, it makes its share of gold from the dwarven brewing rivalry and the surplus of dwarves (and other humanoids) who partake of it. Much of the village's other residents live in this same northeast quadrant as the Blade, with the houses farther away from the tavern considered more valuable than the ones directly beside it (guess why that is <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->).
It should also be mentioned that the militia HQ is located on School grounds. Erytios, and eladrin, is the protector-general of Whitevale and leads the militia.
