# [Freedom City Stories]Rooftops by night : Nighthawk story

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-18 13:34:45)

A cool clear night, a blessing after the hot days of the fast approaching summer.
Perched high on the rooftops of Southside Nighthawks await. The district isn't as shady as lincoln and see far less gang activity, but rumour as it that the hold of organized crime here is getting stronger everyday.
If nothing else, the presence of many students from freedom college as attracted a number of dealers for various drugs.
If her informations are correct, a deal should be taking place nearby for a large quantity of Zoom, the drugs granting superspeed to it's user.

Nighthawk hated Zoom.
Well, Nighthawk hated illicit and illegal drugs as it was. But Zoom? That was a bad one. There were enough powered criminals running around the city as it was, making life troublesome for the authorities; for herself. However, Zoom granted ordinary people a momentary boost of speed so incredible, so blinding. Sure, it could be used for good things, that's how all these things start, isn't it? Starting as some herbal remedy or prescription medication, or passed off as something that can help with a minor problem like that 50-page term paper due in two days. But this Zoom ... it was annoying. It kept her too busy.
And Nighthawk hated speedsters.
More like she was faintly jealous of them, and annoyed she had to guess where they would be, rather than keeping up with them on /decent/ terms.
The hot evening only made Nighthawk's mood worse, her mind drifting to the fact that she really needed to find a more breathable protective fabric as soon as possible. Whose idea was it, anyway, for the full-body costume - hers or her grandfather's? It didn't matter, she needed to put her mind off the heat, so the woman shifted faintly, to crouch against the side of a building, watching the street below her - waiting.
Waiting for the inevitable - when things would go wrong.

About an hour after her stakeout starts, a car park in the alley below the building, quickly followed by another coming from the opposite direction.
Four men get out of each car, two of them carrying stainless steel suitcases. The two meet in the middle ground delimited by the cars with their respective thugs standing guard behind them.

Now this looked promising. Unfortunately, promising meant trouble. Stretching, Nighthawk glanced around for a way down from her elevated perch to something no quite so lofty. Perhaps a street lamp. Yes, a street lamp would be ideal, then if trouble really started should could leap onto the roof of one of the cars, staying behind the headlamps and somewhat obscured, at least for a little while, before rolling backwards into cover and drawing them to her.
Glancing around, Nighthawk's blue eyes looked for such an ideal perch to silently make her way towards, before announcing her arrival and breaking up the big party.

At the far end of the alley waited a street lamp, just what she needed to enact her plan.
The two men in the middle where now discussing and prepared to exchange the briefcases

Smiling to herself, Nighthawk made her way through the shadows. With a flip and a twist - head over heels, Nighthawk barely makes noise as she leaps for the top off the street lamp. Once in place, the woman strains for a moment, trying to listen in on the discussion if she can, but not for long. After all, she knows what is going down. Pulling out one of her balls, Nighthawk waits, waits for just the right moment, before pulling her hand back and letting fly with an attack, hoping to startle one of the men into dropping a briefcase.
Then Nighthawk is on the move again, straining with her legs, leaping as far as she can, tumbling through the air to try and land on the roof of one of the cars still with it's headlights on.
((OOC: Basically 2 rounds of actions. 1st round: Stealth +12, Acrobatics +16. Second round: Attack +5, Acrobatics +16))

The throwing ball fly true and hit one of the gangster with a briefcase in the hand, making him drop the briefcase wich opens on impact, the drugs it contain falling out and spreading out on the floor.
With a graceful jump and a tumble, Nighthawks land on one of the car, at wich points the thugs draw there pistols and surrounds their boss.
The gangaster still holding his briefcase retreat toward his car, the one on wich nighthawk isn't, screaming at his men to protect him.
((Combat start with a surprise round during wich you launch your ball. GM fiat to avoid my ganagster going unconscious directly, so that's 1 hero point for you. Then first round of normal combat start, you win initiative and act first, you jump and land on the car, that's a move action so you still have a standard action.))

Seeing that she has the surprise, Nighthawk pushes herself. With her quarterstaff in hand, she triggers the telescoping mechanism so it slides to full-length. Blue eyes glance over the gangsters, and Nighthawk begins running, off the roof of the car, to the hood, and then into the air - an acrobatic leap to get to the hood of the other car before the second gangster can flee. Tilting her head to the side the woman just smiles and with a deep alto voice drawls, "Leaving so soon? The fun is just about to begin."
((OOC: Acrobatics +16 again.)

The criminal voice squeek at dangerously high level as he screams to his men "shoot her ! shoot her !"
Immediatly afterthat, the night erupts in a furry of light and sounds as the various thugs open fire at nighthawk.
One of the thug gets lucky and his bullet slams into Nighthawk's shoulder.
((Well, how badly it isis up to you, if you don't use a HP you get a stunned and staggered result, I already rerolled suspecting you'd want to use a HP and this time you succeed so no injury at all. Your choice))

### **chibiamy** (2009-07-31 10:50:14)

((OOC: I'll take that reroll. I don't mind getting a little injured, but staggered in the first shot? Ow!))
Grunting as the bullet hits her in the shoulder, Nighthawk spins with it, shifting her stance to twirl down off the hood of the car, swinging the quarterstaff as she does so. As the woman brings the weapon around she uses it to attempt a strike against one armed assailant, the metal staff whistling through the air with the speed at which it slices. Then Nighthawk shifts her feet, to bring the end of the staff upwards in a wicked snap at another of the men on her other side, before those cold blue eyes turn upon the man issuing the orders.
((OOC: Trying to use Takedown Attack x1 here and go after two, if possible, of the Thugs.))

The two thugs fall down quickly, moaning on the concrete with blood issuing from a broken nose.
As Nighthawk turns toward the gangster giving the order, this one manages to climb into his car and quickly drives back into the open streets.
Nighthawks winces when the ganster car crash into her own car before driving away at top speed.
The four thugs left standing look down at their knocked out friend and one of them panics, fleeing. The other three open fire on her again while the second ganagster finish collecting the drugs and runing toward his car as well.
Nighthawks swirl and turns, avoiding the panicked fire easily.
((Two of the 6 thugs are down, one ran away, one of the gangster escaped, crashing into her car gaining you an HP and the second gangster is now ready to escape))

### **chibiamy** (2009-08-05 16:59:05)

((OOC: Sorry, RL exploded again!))
Grimacing, Nighthawk sighs and murmurs so only she, herself can hear, "Not my car again...." as the gangster pulls away, and runs into her own car down the street. Damn, that's going to cost a fortune. Blue eyes flick up towards where she has her camera stashed, before she pulls her mind back into focus on the situation, just in time to avoid fire from the thugs.
Noting that the second of the drug-dealing gangsters is ready to run, Nighthawk pushes herself, swinging the quarterstaff as she moves, attacking as she goes. She takes one step, then another, swiping at two of the thugs, before leaping into the air, in an attempt to get behind the man trying to flee. "Not tonight, pal," she offers, in a husky voice.
Drawing in a rough bit of air, the woman then brings the staff around, attempting to shove it into a kneecap to make escape more difficult.
((OOC: Takedown attack, then HP for an Extra attack))

The thugs cry out in pain and two more of them fall down on the floor unconscious, the ast one prepare to shoot Nighthawk when she jumps overhead and lands in front of his boss and hit him in the kneecap sending him down to a knee. The thug, not having a clear line of shooting, being alone and obviously outmatched decide to run away witha pathetic "sorry boss"
The crime lord then take out his gun and point it directly at you "stay away !, what do you want ?"

## Re: Rooftops by night : Nighthawk story

### **chibiamy** (2009-08-06 12:37:17)

Staring at the gun with obvious disinterest, Nighthawk sighs. "Really now, your hand is shaking too much to be able to shoot straight," she notes in her deep alto, before slowly trying to push the gun aside with the quarterstaff. "I want you to sit here until the cops arrive, is what I want you to do," notes the woman. The eyes behind the dark mask then narrow as she leans in just a bit and leans forward, her voice turning to the barest hint of a growl, "And then you are going to repeat to them, what you're going to tell me right now about all of your suppliers and distributors out on the street."
Nighthawk gives a faint pause as her head tilts to the side, "Capice?"
((OOC: HP to roll an Intimidate. I am going to need to take that skill, methinks.))

((so that would be extra effort to gain a +2 on intimidate with HP to counter the fatigue))
"Alright ! Alright ! I'll talk, just don't hurt me !"
The man cowers in fear and start babling about his contact and his suppliers, especially about an old warehouse not too far where the drug is stockpiled.

Nighthawk could stay behind, take a few pictures, but that would mean possibly missing what was in that warehouse. Sighing, the woman shook her head to herself. "I need a bigger damn belt," she grumbled. Glancing around, the woman began to search for anything that would keep the criminal in place while the authorities arrived, because surely they were coming now with the gunfire, after all. And she didn't really want to have to knock the man out. She really needed to pick up some handcuffs. This was getting ridiculous.

Nothing useful was lying around, it would have to be a belt, again. It was the third time this month that she would have to use a belt to restrain a suspect.

---

## Re: Rooftops by night : Nighthawk story

### **chibiamy** (2009-08-18 14:21:19)

With a sigh, Nighthawk slid the belt from the gangster's waist and started wrapping it around his wrists and through the handle of the door, leaving the man on the outside. "Now, be a good boy, stay here, and sing like a canary to the authorities when they arrive. You can, however, leave out the part about me. I wouldn't mind," notes the woman, once she was satisfied the restraint was the best she was going to do.
That done, Nighthawk offered a salute, before pulling out her swing-line and firing it up onto a building. Travelling over the rooftops to the warehouse was preferable, and it afforded her an exit that wasn't past her car. She'll have to make certain to come back out of the masks to take pictures as Jennifer. The woman paused, then grabbed her belongings, firing off a few shots from a rooftop with access, so Jennifer could say she WAS there and thus why her car was hit, before Nighthawk took off towards the warehouse - post haste.

Nighthawk manages to reach the warehous in under twenty minutes, long before the criminal would have started talking to the cops and certainly long before the cops would have started organizing a raid.
She stands on a rooftop in front of the warehouse.

## Re: Rooftops by night : Nighthawk story

### **chibiamy** (2009-08-25 11:19:53)

From the rooftop, Nighthawk waits and watches a few moments. It is important to observe a target for decent amount of time. Some people would call this 'casing a joint', such a crude term for actual amount of work involved. Blue eyes slip over the warehouse, looking for cameras, movement, hints of the depth of the security and how many people may, or may not be inside. Cars are looked for, vans, trucks - are they moving the goods, currently? Ideally, Nighthawk would have liked to have looked up who was renting the warehouse currently, but that will have to be done later - besides, anything to keep her mind off of the damage done to her car earlier.

The ware house is under surveillance from several camera, and two guards at each entrance, the place is well lit, the only possible entry point being on the roof with a non surveilled glass window.

## Re: Rooftops by night : Nighthawk story

### **chibiamy** (2009-08-30 16:44:07)

((OOC: GAH! I hate RL some days!))
Observing the warehouse, it seems Nighthawk's only entry point is from the roof, where there rest a window that someone decided not to put a camera on. Logic would dictate there might likely be some sort of movement sensor on the window - something she will have to check once she was safely on the roof. Glancing around, the woman's blue eyes narrow as she observes the buildings in the area. The preferable option would be to swing-line over to the roof, considering the distance between warehouses - and as quietly as possible, at that.
((OOC: Okay, option a) swing-line to the roof and observe the window for sensors. If that is not available option b) is to get a running start off the nearest roof to the warehouse and jump/tumble over to that roof. AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE. Etc. Acrobatics +16, Stealth +12, Search +12))

*Nighthawks jump and tumble on the roof of the warehouse, her silent and dark form barely visible against the night sky. SHe lands with a soft thud on the warehouse roof with barely a disturbance in the air.*

((OOC: Sorry about that, husband was ... demanding when he was down w/ back surgery. Along with some issues with my child and his school. BACK NOW!))
Slipping as sliently along as she can, Nighthawk makes her way carefully to the window in question. Adjusting her angle of view, the woman slowly seers into the opening, ready to duck out of sight should anyone, or thing, look in her direction. Observation is the key, surveying what you are about to get into, and that is what Nighthawk does, before she then begins to look over the window itself, making certain there are now alarms on the possible point of entry.
((OOC: Want to get a good look, see if I can slip in unnoticed, or if I'm going to have to make a grand entrance, etc. Stealth +12, Notice +10, Search +12))

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-10 15:25:23)

*The window itself appears to be free of any traps or sensor. Looking down trough it, nighthawk spies a group of gangsters filling small plastic bags with the drug. all around them were crates of what she guessed would be either more drugs, or a way to present a respectable front in case the police showed up.
The inside of the warehous is badly lit, most of it coming from overhead lamps hanging from the ceiling. This means the ceiling and various beams are always in the dark, and the crates themselves offer a good hidding place.*
