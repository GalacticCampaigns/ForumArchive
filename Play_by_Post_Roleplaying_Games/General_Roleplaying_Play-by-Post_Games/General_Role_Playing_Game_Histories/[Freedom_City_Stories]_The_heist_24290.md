# [Freedom City Stories] The heist

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-18 13:36:03)

It was a fairly ordinary afternoon in the eastern seaboard bank in downtown freedom.
-Ricky had come to the bank to get some money to pay the rent for his appartement, hunting demon was a noble activity but it didn't exactly pay the bills. He was waiting his turn in the line to use the ATM.
-Diamondback was in one of the offices along the north side of the bank, negotiating a loan with one of the managers and using her diplomatic ties as credentials
However, today would prove to be anything but ordinary.
A group of armed men suddenly burst through the front doors of the building and into the lobby. They order the bank patrons to lie on the floor and clear the way for a man and a woman to enter behind them. The pair is in their early 20’s; both are dressed in raver-style clothes. The woman hair is long and flowing and the man’s short and spiky. There’s a definite family resemblance.
“Rant and Rave are in da house!” the man says with a smirk. “Nobody messes with us, nobody gets hurt. Got it?” For emphasis he turns toward the bank guard edging toward the alarm and gives a loud shout. The man goes flying up against the wall and slumps to the floor, unconscious.

*What the hell?* Ricky thinks, going to the floor like everyone else in order to give himself time to think, though making sure he is facing the would-be robbers. *Definitely not daemons and definitely bad guys, so there doesn't seem need for an aura check.*
*Not really my responsibility though, is it?* He wonders, just as the security guard is lifted off his feet by some supernatural power and slammed against a wall.
*Crap. I guess it is.*
Ricky tries to gauge whether the alarm can be hit by a precise hellfire blast, considering that if he wants to thwart these robbers he should do so in a way that frightens them away and leaves the hostages safe.
((OOC: I would like to attempt to trigger the alarm through the force of a blast as an attack action. Hellfire Blast 10 (Vampiric; Affects Insubstantial Rank 2; Improved Range 1). Whatever the outcome of that attack, he uses his move action to stand up while pulling his hat brim down and his coat collar up around his face.))

Diamondback was just about to sign for the short term loan, Just some extra money to help the foreign supper to get settled in while she waited for her regular paychecks from the Embassy to start coming though.
She turned just in time to see Rant and Rave enter the room, and she ducked down behind the door. Slowly and carefully she drew her PAMAS pistol, and moved to behind the pair.

Ricky was about to let a blast fly before he realised that the alarm was a silent one and that activating it this way would defeat the purpose. Nearly at the same time Diamondback managed to slip unoticed by other Rant, Rave or their thugs, too busy handling the hostages, right behind the two robbers.

*Very well. If the crows can't be scared from the field, target the crows themselves,'* Ricky thinks, quickly reassessing the circumstances in which he finds himself. Instinctively, perhaps, he settles on the man as his first target. There is probably a deep and likely even sexist psychological reason behind that decision, but Ricky himself has no time to contemplate the potential ramifications of his choice.
With his mind he shapes a ball of hellfire and launches it toward the male robber, and for a brief moment enjoys the thought of the man having to suffer through the knowledge of his Sins as the supernatural fire envelops him.
As the energy flies from his fingertips Ricky is already getting to his feet while pulling his hat brim down and his collar up to conceal as much as he can of his face.

Diamond back silently cursed, as the ball of hellfire suddenly blasted out at the man. Forgetting her gun, her alien implants powered up, generating an energy shield to protect her, even as they covered her fists.
Since the attack was targeting the boy, Diamondback charged the girl, intending to take her down hard before things got out of hand.
( Strike 8, against the chick. And remember I have sneak attack feat. )

Ricky stand and unleash the hellfire on Rant, but misses him by an few inches, at the same time Diamondback tries to tackle the girl but alerted by the hellfire blast, Rave sidestep to avoid the flames, at the same time putting her out of the way of Diamondback's attack.
After locating the source of the attack Rant let a shout out, the sonic blast moving at great speed toward Ricky who dodges just in time to avoid getting knocked by it.

'We'll consider those warning shots, shall we,' Ricky says, lifting his flame-wreathed fist in Rant's direction. 'Look, I don't particularly need this, nor do I want it. And you should be smart enough to realise whatever happens now your plans are in ruins. What say you leave now, and I might even give you a head start before calling in someone who cares to deal with you?'
Part bluff and part honest truth, Ricky thinks his suggestion is compelling enough though even he doubts it will work. He's met enough scum elements to know they generally don't take well to advice. In any case, he is ready to attack again just as soon as any of the crooks makes a wrong move.
((OOC: Ready action to attack Rant again should Rant, Rave, or any of the gun-toting thugs even twitch the wrong way.))

### **Avarna** (2009-12-19 21:54:40)

Diamondback smiled, as she readied herself for what might come next. She was alittle suprised that it was the man shooting hellfire that first though to offer them an out. "Yes, I would suggest you listen to the pompier."

"You'll never catch us" say Rant in a venomous voice "In case you haven'ts noticed we aren't alone here, you wouldn't want to endanger all those peoples now would you ?" as he speak, rave unleash her powers, distorting the field of vision of Ricky and Diamondback, the image seems to spin and twist making everything confusing. Before being affected Ricky manages to unleash a blast of Hellfire toward Rant who dodges it.
At this point the group of thugs Open fire at Diamondback and Ricky, obviously unnafected by Rave powers. Diamondback and Ricky dodges the shots almost effortlessly until Rant shouts a sonic blast at Ricky that he manages to narrowly avoid.
Outside the bank Garrif approached until he heard gunshot coming from inside.

As Garrif walked down the street, looking like a blond haired teenager again, he began to pick up the stressed out thoughts pouring out of the bank up ahead. As he came closer to the bank, he even heard the gun shots confirming what his mind reading had already told him. Two supers, known as Rant and Rave, were robbing the bank with a group of thugs that worked with them.
It also seemed that there were two heroes in the bank, fighting off the robbers. One of them even seemed to possess some control over Hellfire.
*This should be interesting. Maybe another half-demon?*
Either way, Garrif knew that they needed help. The goons with guns had opened fire on them. No doubt this battle would go significantly easier if the super distorting their perceptions were no longer doing so. Stepping through the door of the bank and standing behind the robbers, Garrif allowed the Glamour to dissipate, revealing his true self. Standing there in his mage robes with his blood-red eyes, Garrif waved his hand in front of himself, pointed at Rave, and spoke the words,
**"Arrenpentiii os!"**
Arcane symbols appeared in a tight circle around Garrif's hand as the beam of eldritch energy shot out from the circle, aimed at Rave's back. As always, Garrif had no intention of killing the girl, simply knocking her out.

Ricky's eyes roll as he hears Rant's nonsensical reply to his suggestion.
'Idiot,' he says, 'don't forget I tried to give you an out later, and reflect on your stupidity. I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to do so.'
Then his world goes crazy, and he can no longer trust his sense of vision. Thankfully for him, Ricky has a whole array of other supernatural senses that still prove reliable, and as gunshots and even another sonic blast are directed his way, he somehow manages to predict them all and throw himself to safety.
He hears a new voice speaking in some arcane tongue, but Ricky feels no danger from that source and is simply relieved assistance seems to have appeared so rapidly.
While his sight is still addled, Ricky decides to target his foes the easiest way he knows how. He extends his hellish awareness, sure that it will detect the presence of all the villains, and mentally maps their locations. He then throws an blast in the direction of whichever Evil is nearest to where Rave had been standing before unleashing her illusory attack.

### **Avarna** (2009-12-22 19:18:16)

Diamondback hadn't forgotten about the thugs, even as bullets bounced off her energy shield. She simply recognized that the boy and girl were the leaders, and thus the most dangerous.
Even with her impaired sense of vision, Diamondback charged forward, trying to tackle the girl.

## Re: The heist

### **Anonymous** (2009-12-23 14:11:35)

Everyone attack rave at the same time but between the care to avoid hitting each other and her distorting field everybody misses, diamondback falling down on the floor after her missed charge.
Rave laughs at her pitiful effort and says to her brother "They will never be able to catch us, I think I'll have some fun with them"
The vision of the heroes reassume it's normalcy while the thugs turn toward garrif and Ricky, the two more obvious threat
Ricky once again manages to dodge their attack but Garrif isn't so lucky and one of their bullet catches him in the shoulder.
Rant watches Ricky dodge all the attack and says "enough, I'll show you how it's done" He then unleash a powerful sonic scream at Ricky wich ddamages the floor and wall all around him, Ricky is unable to avoid the attck but his incredible resistance allow him to avoid getting hurt
((Garrif is stunned and bruised, Ricky gain 1HP because Rant Aped an area attack but make his toughness save))

### **Anonymous** (2009-12-23 16:11:34)

Garrif grunts as the bullet tears into his shoulder. It's not that he hasn't felt pain, even gun shot wounds, before during his abnormally long life, but that didn't stop it from hurting. As his vision blurred for a second, he knew that not one moment could be spared if the other mortals were to be spared. Redoubling his will power, Garrif forced his vision to clear by sheer will power alone.
**"Agh! Cursed mortals! I come here looking for something simple for mine own purposes! I walk into this establishment and find the group of you in the process of stealing its contents, which I cannot tolerate. I intend to end this conflict *without* injuring any of you… <span style="font-size: 1.00em;">AND YOU SHOOT ME?</span>"**
Weaving his hands in an intricate pattern, Garrif began casting a spell to make sure that problems with vision would be shared. It was only fair, after all.
***"She Who is Three,
Upon Triformus we call.
Remove some sight,
And let darkness fall."***
As Garrif spoke the words and made the patterns with his hands, a circle of arcane symbols appeared on the floor around Garrif. As anyone who saw it watched, green flames appeared in Garrif's eyes, as well as the eyes of Diamondback and Ricky. Suddenly the circle of symbols on the floor at Garrif's feet expanded in all directions at once, filling the entirety of the bank. Dark mists flowed with the circle's growth, blanketing the entire bank in complete and utter darkness.
Diamondback and Ricky would have seen the darkness expand, but are still able to see perfectly, just with a slightly greenish tint.
As soon as the spell was cast, Garrif moved behind a pillar, continuing a slight motion with his hands to keep the Hood of Heshem running.
(Reaction - Spend HP to remove Stun Effect)
(Standard - Cast **Hood of Heshem (Obscure 12)** (Alternate; affects: one sense type - visual, Radius: 25000 ft.; Selective Attack), selectively not removing Ricky's and Diamondback's sight.) This creates Total Obscurity.

Ricky stands firm as Rant's sound-based attack tears up the floor tiles and causes the nearest wall to crack and crumble. And yet he himself stands upright, unharmed, and apparently unconcerned, smiling sinisterly in his attacker's direction.
'Thanks for showing me how it's done. My turn now.'
He shapes the hellfire around his hands into a scythe-like form, brandishing it menacingly. Rant has time to witness this before the supernatural darkness created by Garrif falls.
Ricky grins. He's not sure who the mysterious benefactor is or how he did what he just did, but it's clearly a positive thing from his point of view. He takes advantage of the fallen darkness to advance on Rant and strike at the super-criminal's chest with the torturous flames.

Diamondback got back up onto her feet, and turned to look towards. Holding her force shield ready, she carefully closed the distance between herself and the girl. And again took a swing at her with her protected fists.

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-06 15:42:06)

In the confusion following the sudden darkness, Ricky flaming scythe sears trough the space where Rant would have been if he hadn't ducked, the man then taunts ricky "I may not be able to see you but I still can hear a pin drop at a hundred pace."
Almost simultaneously, Diamondback punch at Rave and lands a blow directly accross her jaw, or so she thinks.
Ricky recoils as he takes a punch from Diamondback.
The thugs accompanying Rant and Rave are completely lost in the darkness and one of them run head first into a wall knocking himself out in his panic.
Rave is caught in the darkness and let fall her illusion in panic and grip her brother. "we have to get out of here!" Rant quickly agree and with an ear shattering sound the pair unleash a powerful attack on the support beam of the roof of the bank.
Rant taunts them again "now you'll have to chose, either let us go or save everyone from getting squished".

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-06 17:35:30)

Seeing the young boy shatter the roof support beam with his sonic scream, Garrif immediately stopped making the arcane gestures he had been doing and ran from behind the pillar to underneath the support beam.
Looking up at the crack in the beam, he began making new gestures.
**"Strength is needed,
More than we possess,
So here me, Heshem,
And ease our distress."**
As he uttered the final word, energy coalesced around Garrif's arms and stretched up towards the ceiling and the cracked beam. As the energy stretched, it shaped itself into hands and grabbed the beam, forcing it into place and holding it there.
Turning towards the others who'd been helping out, Garrif called out,
"Better hurry. I'm not too sure how long I can hold this thing up."
(Stopped casting Hood of Heshem and cast Hand of Heshem to hold up the beams.)

Ricky reels from Diamondback's punch, but is thankfully protected by his various supernatural gifts. He chooses not to reprimand her, assuming she fell victim to the illusions with no means of identifying the true enemy.
With the pillar now cracking, and Garrif expending considerable power to keep the roof up, Ricky roars:
'**Everybody out! NOW!**'
He strides across the room, extinguishing his fires as he does so. He reaches the knocked out robber and lifts him, carrying him toward the nearest exit.

### **Avarna** (2010-01-07 01:01:01)

"This way, Hurry!" Diamondback calls out, as she starts helping people get back onto they're feet, and moving towards the various exits. Using her shield to protect people from falling debris.
She'd worry about apologizing to the man she'd hit latter, once the danger had passed.

The roof's collapse is halted by Garrif while Rant, Rave and their remaining thugs escape trough the front door before any of the hostage can be evacuated, the heroes watch them climb into two vans and starting their escape.

## Re: The heist

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-08 10:10:56)

The sight of the criminals escaping leaves a bitter taste in Ricky's mouth. If they were going to flee anyway, why couldn't they have left when he'd given them the option, rather than endangering the lives of innocents? And his own, for that matter.
*If I ever meet those two a second time I won't give them an easy option again,* he decides, *they deserve jail time. You don't need to be a daemon to be daemonic.*
He steps across the rubble and drops the thug he is carrying unceremoniously on the road. He then returns to check everyone is escaping and assists anyone that needs it, if necessary protecting them from falling rubble with his supernaturally warded body and his hellfire shield.
As he helps one of the last victims out of the building, Ricky looks back at Gariff and wonders if the mage can extract himself without assistance.

As Garrif stands in the middle of the bank, ethereal hands stretching from his arms to the roof of the building, he notices the criminals escaping. A snarl escapes his lips until he notices the crook that the flame wielding mortal carried out of the building.
*Oh, I'll have to have a word with that one.*
As Garrif watches, relief does wash over as the mortals in the bank manage to make their way out of the bank. After the last one makes it out, Garrif releases his mystical grip on the bank's ceiling and makes a run for the door.

By the time the heroes evacuate the bank the thiefs are long gone, luckily whitout any money. The cops get to the bank just seconds before Garrif let the ceiling down and escape from the building. Quickly an ambulance is called to deal with peoples in shock.
Ricky is left with one of the thugs as prisoner.

Having escaped the collapse of the building, Garrif looked back at the rubble and decided it was time for answers. Walking over towards Ricky (though he doesn't know the name yet), Garrif nodded and stretched out his hand.
"Well done in there. You got everyone out. Now, how about we get some information from this fellow right here?"

## Re: The heist

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-11 22:43:40)

Ricky accepts Garrif's hand and shakes it firmly. At the same time, he is using his supernatural senses to judge the alignment of everyone within range, including both Garrif and Diamondback. He has trusted too easily before.
'I think most of the credit belongs to you, actually,' he replies fervently, 'things would have gone much worse without your intervention.'
He nods toward the unconscious criminal at his feet.
'I'd love to know what he has to say, but if its all the same to you I think I'll make myself scarce before the cops or the news get hold of me. I don't have a superheroic identity and I don't particularly fancy my private life, which is already a bit of a joke, becoming a media circus. Apart from making a difficult life more miserable, it would make it near-impossible to manage my responsibilities.'

## Re: The heist

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-12 05:49:58)

Looking the human over with a quick eye, Garrif knows he needs to make a decision. He needs to decide whether or not he could trust the human with his home. He did help the people out during the collapse of the bank, as did the woman. Maybe they could be trusted after all. Looking the man and the woman up and down for a second, Garrif nods, having made his choice.
**"If privacy would be more to your taste, then grab the fellow and follow me. As to you, madame, you're welcome to come along as well if you seek some privacy."**
Garrif nods towards Diamondback with that last statement as well.
Turning towards an empty alley way, Garrif ducks in and quickly begins making arcane gestures with the rhythm of the universe.
**"By the mists of Mordo,
By the power of Baralk,
Bridge the distance,
And let me walk."**
As the last word is spoken, arcane symbols appear in mid-air in a circle that quickly expands large enough to allow people to pass through them. As the portal finishes opening, those looking through it see an old-styled study with a fire burning in the hearth, arm chairs, and many books on the shelves to either side of the hearth.
Garrif nods towards Diamondback and Ricky and motions for them to follow him as he steps through himself.

## Re: The heist

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-13 09:50:17)

*Curious* Ricky thinks as his aura sense returns very confusing signals from Garrif, *could he be like me?*
Whatever the truth of the matter, he is sure to get to the bottom of it in due time. He has to, now that he knows there is some dark connection there.
At the least Ricky doesn't think a betrayal is likely, based on the larger aspect of the man's aura. Deciding that it might be safe to demonstrate a small amount of trust in this instance, he picks up the unconscious robber again and heads through the mage's portal.
'Nice place,' he comments with a glance around the study, 'looks not dissimilar to the home of another mage I know.'
'Where do you want him?' he then asks, indicating the limp man in his arms with a nod of the head.

"I'm used to dealing with the Media." Diamondback replies, with a smile in her french accent. "I'll stay here for now and handle the public, thank you for the offer though."
She does hand Garriff her business card, containing her cell phone number. "But you'll stay in touch, *qui*?"
Then the French super, Turns and walks over to the police. She'd abandoned her regular identity long ago, And even now signed legal documents under her super hero identity. In her mind she was already preparing a statement for the police and media concerning the foiled back robbery.

## Re: The heist

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-13 17:23:17)

Taking the offered card from the French girl, Garrif nodded and smiled.
**"Mais oui. I'll give you a call in half an hour or so. If you wish, I'll retrieve you then."**
Passing through the portal, Garrif inhaled the smells of home. Of course it had been a few years since another person had entered the estate, so Garrif noted the new smell in the house. As soon as Ricky had entered, Garrif closed down the portal and immediately opened his mind to the new visitors of the house. He sifted through any conscious thoughts that might be passing through both minds, but also made sure that he listened for waking thoughts from the thug.
Hearing Ricky's question, Garrif turned around and smiled.
**"Oh, I'm sure that we can offer some accommodations to our guest."**
Garrif clapped his hands once and golems entered the room and went to work. Two of them attended to Garrif, taking his robes from him and leaving the room to wash them. One of the golems entered carrying a tray of water and assorted snacks, mostly cheese and crackers. When they were done, Garrif looked at one of them and said, **"Thank you. Now, if you would go and prepare one of the cells for our unconscious friend here. He'll be needed bedding and some food, I imagine."**
Turning towards Ricky, Garrif motioned towards the exiting golem and started to follow the brute himself. Turning towards Ricky as they walked (assuming that Ricky follows, I can correct otherwise), Ricky smiles. **"So tell me, to what mage were you referring, my good man?"**

## Re: The heist

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-14 01:15:17)

Ricky walks alongside Gariff, but not before grabbing a class of water and a side plate of cheese and crackers from the mage's golem before it takes his charge from him and carries the criminal off toward a cell. He takes a sip and a bite to eat before answering the queries directed at him.
'A fellow named Eldritch,' he explained in reply to Gariff's question, 'Captain Thunder insisted I spoke to him when I first arrived in the city. He told me he'd help me get in contact with other people in the same field but it never really happened. I expect the man's busy though, hanging with the big boys... so I can't exactly blame him.'

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-14 08:04:09)

As Garrif and Ricky walked down the hall and down a few stair cases, their boots echoing off of the stone work floor, Garrif looked at the cheese plate in Ricky's hands and smiled.
**"You should really try the brillo de trevolis. We've been aging that batch for a while now. It's particularly excellent."**
Hearing Ricky's mental debate about trust, Garrif sighed and realized that if Ricky were to trust him, he'd have to tell the human everything. Stopping just outside one of the cells in the sub-basement, having been walking for about ten minutes at this point, Garrif motioned for the golem to gently place the unconscious thug inside the cell and shut the door. Turning towards Ricky, Garrif tried to smile a disarming smile, though it was probably offset by his blood-red eyes.
**"Well, as soon as he wakes up, we'll be able to get the information out of him, don't worry. By the way, as to the question your asking yourself about whether or not you could trust me, I hope that you feel that you can. Something I don't tell everyone, but I'll tell you so you know I'm not hiding anything, is that I can hear your thoughts. Just the surface ones. However, I will be able to do a deep probe of our thug friend in a minute here. I just don't want there to be secrets between us if we're to work together."**
Hoping to jump to a different subject, Garrif quickly adds;
**"So, you know Eldritch, eh?"**

## Re: The heist

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-14 09:06:23)

*Exactly how big is this house?* Ricky thinks as the two walk through its halls, then adds wryly to his inner monologue: *I should have gone into this mage gig and not supernatural vigilantism.*
*And why are there even cells here in the first place?* he reflects somewhat darkly as he watches Garrif's golem deposit its load in rather more gentle fashion than Ricky himself had been treating the man.
As the mage explains he has been tuned in to Ricky's thought processes the entire time, the daemon hunter sighs.
'Isn't almost everyone I know?' he mutters to himself, then quickly gestures for Garrif to continue and ignore the interruption. He looks into the man's red eyes and doesn't seem *particularly* disturbed by them. He's seen worse. He does worry about what they might mean.
As the mage attempts his conversational deflection, Ricky munches silently on his last piece of cheese. He swallows, washes the snack down with the remaining water in his glass, and declares his judgement:
'It was *all* rather excellent. And yes, I know Eldritch. Or I've met him at least, its not like we're bosom buddies. Especially since I was effectively threatened into seeing him in the first place.'
'I can't say the knowledge you can get inside my head makes me particularly happy,' he says after a moment, diverting the conversation inevitably back toward the uncomfortable, 'but I appreciate your being up-front about it. In which case you should know I already found out a few things from you, too, which is why I trusted you enough to eat your food. That and the fact that as amazing as your golems are, I doubt they'd make particularly effective poisoners. Its a bit of a finesse job. But no I don't trust you fully. There's something very strange about your soul. Its almost as though there are two and one has almost blocked off the other. I can't get a clear reading, but what I do get worries me a lot.'
'You know I'm a daemon hunter by supernatural trade?' he asks mildly as though simply making conversation, watching Garrif's eyes closely to see his reaction.

## Re: The heist

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-14 19:12:08)

Garrif nods at Ricky's comments about trust. At the mention of demon hunting, Ricky's eyes widen, just ever so slightly.
**"Hmm. Well I guess that that means that we're in similar professions. However, before we get into that, allow me to introduce myself since I gather that you're *not* a mind reader. My name's Garrif."**
Garrif sticks out his hand and motions for the demon hunter to follow him back up the stairs.
**"Now to the questions you haven't asked and the reason why you're having trouble reading my *aura*. I guess that's why you call it."**
Garrif continued to lead the way up winding stairs and through various halls. Ricky most likely has noticed that there are no windows, though the lighting is not a problem in the least.
**"My home has a little over 400,000 square feet in floor space, at least on the inside. I wouldn't suggest that you personally enter the profession of mage, though. Not all of us have such illustrious homes. I know quite a few who are barely able to make ends meet. Magic in and of itself does not pay much, if at all. It's a lot like being a full time student for the rest of your life. Most mages bounce from odd job to odd job while studying and trying to understand the universe.
"What makes me different from most mages isn't that I'm an inherently better mage, but that I'm quiet a bit older than them, and so have gained money through *very* long term investments. I made some investments during the Great Depression, and they've seen me through the present. However, this castle was not purchased, or even built during this millennium. It originally was located in Europe, though I'm not sure where exactly. During the mid-1930's, I used a fairly powerful ritual to bring it here. I'm sure that I'd not want to do that again, mind you. That ritual nearly killed me."**
Garrif paused for a moment in reflection.
*The ritual actually **did** kill me. That hurt for a while.*
Turning towards Ricky, Garrif stopped walking and looked seriously into the human's eyes.
**"As to why you have trouble reading me, Demon Hunter, that's simple. I'm not human. I'm part demon. My father is the Ragetear, leader of the Armies of Chaos. My mother was human. He seduced her quite some time ago. He had meant for me to be his scion her in the mortal realm. If it hadn't been for a certain mage, he'd have succeeded. However, the mage protected me and trained me to protect myself from my father.
"So, what I told you about being a demon hunter myself is partially true. I just don't hunt all demons. I only hunt one in particular. My father."**
Garrif let his words hang in the air, listening to Ricky's thoughts to gauge his reaction.

Ricky listens to the entire explanation, looking increasingly tense as his understanding is broadened. By the time Garrif concludes he seems to be waging an inner war with himself.
Turning eyes that honestly express the concern and fear raging in the grey-matter beyond them on the part-breed daemon, he says:
'I just don't know. Everything I ever learned about daemons tells me they're inevitably, irredeemably evil. My experience of humans tells me they're usually worth a chance. But where do you fit?'
The hunter expels a deep sigh.
'Look, I've seen your soul and I know there's some good in there. So I guess that means the Administration consider you on the fence. I'm not going to make an ill-informed choice here, so I'll put some trust in you. But if I'm honest, I don't like it. Its too hard to trust daemons.'
Ricky pauses, fingers of his left hand whitening as they tighten on his glass. He looks down at them and relaxes his grip.
'Most of the time I can't even trust myself.'

"I can understand that lack of trust," Garrif says. "I just hope that you'll judge me on my actions and not my bloodline."
Garrif resumes walking for a moment before stopping again.
"How long did we say we'd wait before contacting the French woman?"

'You gave her half an hour,' Ricky replies, glad of the chance to move on. 'I haven't been keeping track of time, but I think that'd give somewhere between five to ten minutes still on the clock.'
'Mind if I borrow your library?' he asks, 'I'd like to know what you have on an old associate of mine.'

"Please, All I can say to the Media at the moment, Is there was an attempted Bank Robbery. And that I intervened with the help of two other individuals who with to remain anonymous at the moment. And that it was the attempted Robbers who destroyed the bank as they tried to flee." Diamondback replied to the media. blowing a kiss to the cameras as she climbed into a police cruiser to be taken to the nearest station so she can give the police a more complete statement.
It was while giving her statement to the police, that she looked though a collection of mug shots. That's where she learned the names of the villians. Rant and Rave, a brother and Sister who went into crime after they gained powers.

Garrif nods and leads the way back towards the library, stopping one of the golems on the way.
"Make sure we're told the moment our guest downstairs wakes up."
Reaching the library, Garrif motions towards the books.
"Well, take all the time you want. Like you said, I gave her half an hour, so, we should still have 2 hours and five minutes left from your time. Time moves differently here than outside the estate."

'Somehow I'm not surprised,' Ricky comments with wry acknowledgement.
Determined to make the most of his time in Garrif's library, he begins searching the books for any information that might therein be found on the arch-daemon Mastema, plague on humanity and source of most of his current personal woes.

Two hours seems to pass in the rectory while Ricky searches for information. The extent of the library makes it very unlikely that Ricky would find anything usefull and in truth he doesn't, yet.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-22 14:24:40)

'Well,' Ricky comments as he closes a particularly thick grimoire after realising two hours are up, 'I don't know what I hoped to find but I haven't found it yet. And you're due to call on that woman.'
'Try not to surprise her,' he adds, 'she packs a mean punch.'

## Re: The heist

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-23 09:42:09)

Garrif smiles.
"Yes, I seem to remember that punch looked like it hurt. I'll stay behind her then."
Pulling out his cell phone, Garrif dialed the number that Diamondback gave him.
"Oui? Madomeselle? Where are you?"

Ricky stares, and has a private chuckle over the incongruity of the half-demon magus and his cell phone.

Diamondback smiled and spoke with the Police until her phone started to ring. She answered it and nodded. "Je suis au poste de police. Donnez-moi un peu de temps."
Assuming the cops were finished with her. She left the station continuing to speak on her cell phone, until she was able to fly up to the roof of a nearby building out of sight of those on the street below her. "Ainsi où sont vous? Avez-vous besoin d'ouvrir un portail ou devrais-je juste voler là?"

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-23 13:38:36)

Garrif nodded into his cellphone.
"Oui, certainment."
Hanging up the phone, Garrif noticed the smile on Ricky's lips and decided he'd ask in a minute. Making motions with his hands, Garrif the necessary words.
"By the mists of Mordo,
By the power of Baralk,
Bridge the distance,
And let me walk."
A portal appears in a circle of arcane symbols in mid air, expanding enough to fit a person through. Garrif steps through the portal and sees the French woman.
"Ah, madomoiselle. Souhaitez-vous s'il vous plaît venir avec moi?"

"Ah, madame. Would you please come with me."

With that, he motions back towards the portal.

"Qui." Diamondback replied with a smile, Holding out her hand, like a proper lady, for the magician to assist her though the portal.

After showing Diamondback around, the golem in charge of looking over the prisoner shows up to announce that the captive is awake.

"Comme vous pouvez voir, la Mme, nous avons chaque besoin..."

"As you can see, ms, we have every need..."

</details>

Garrif stopped his explanation mid sentence as the golem announced that the prisoner had awakened. Turning towards Diamondback and Ricky,...
"Ah, friends, it would appear that our guest downstairs has awakened. Shall we?"
He then extends his arm towards Diamondback in oldstyle chivalry.
*Some things should never have gone out of style.*

## Re: The heist

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-31 18:34:22)

'Uhuh,' Ricky replies, getting to his feet and waiting for either Garrif or the golem to lead the way.
*Like I could find my way back there in this house!*
He shows some bemusement at the other man's gesture: for him, chivalry usually only goes so far as holding open a door, and more often as not these days that somehow makes him a bad guy.

"Of course, Let me speak with the man first. I'm sure he'll respond more easily to myself then either of you gentlemen." Diamondback offered. She was fairly certain she had better people skills then either the Mage of demon hunter.
She took the offered arm, and let herself be lead down to where the prisoner was being kept.

'I really wouldn't be so sure,' Ricky murmurs to himself as he follows behind them at a short distance, 'its simply *amazing* what a man will do to run from his own sins...'
This time round being both more alert and less preoccupied with a cheese platter, he attempts to memorise the route.

Taking Diamondback's arms, Garrif lead the trio down the hallways, side corridors, and stairwells that lead to the dungeons. After about 10 minutes of walking, they come upon a large, bolted door with a golem standing guard outside.
Turning towards the others, Garrif cleared his throat.
"Ahem. As I understand it, madame would like first crack at our guest? If I might make a suggestion. Perhaps the Master Walker and myself could serve as imposing gentlemen in the background? If that should fail, I do tend to agree that a good jolt of guilt might come in handy. I would hate to have to ... *extract* the information myself. It tends to leave the person, ... well ... discomforted."
As soon as nods or counter suggestions were heard, Garrif opened the dungeon door and held it open for Diamondback and Ricky before closing it behind them. Leading them through the cellar dungeons, past various other empty cells, Garrif showed his new allies the cell that the criminal was being kept in. The cell had a fairly comfortable bed and a dinner tray set on the table for the prisoner to eat from. The food would be a fair meal, especially when compared to prison food in other cells. It would be obvious that the criminal was being well cared for.

The prisoner was lying down on the bed,chewing on a small chicken bone. The empty meal tray the only remnant of his meal.
His large round brutish face turn toward the three heroes as they approached his cell, his expression a scowl.

Garrif frowned at the brute's face.
"Now, now, good sir. I don't think that such a face is warrented under the circumstances. You've been well cared for and fed. Also, you're in the presences of a lady. Surely, sir, you have the decency to stand in her presence?"

"Really? That is a shame." Diamondback replies, stepping into the room. "However You really don't owe anything to Rant and Rave, After all They left you for dead. Yes, I know who you were working for, and I know they care nothing for the thugs such as yourself that they recruit."

As Diamondback stepped into the room, Garrif loosened his grip on her arm and let her get in front. At the same time, he reached out with his mind and began scanning the surface thoughts of the human prisoner.

'Waste of time,' Ricky says as he walks across the cell to a point where he remains somewhat distant from the prisoner, but still within the man's peripheral vision.
'People like Rant and Rave, they don't inspire followers. This one's a goon just in it for the money. Its not loyalty that stops him from talking, its his fear of what they might do to him if they find out he's snitched.'
'The important thing the gentleman has to realise,' he adds, 'is that there are scarier people than Rant and Rave out there. He might know what they're capable of, but he has *no idea* what ***I*** can do.'
As he says these last words, his right arm is surrounded by the terrible hellfire flames he commands, the flickering energy tapering to a point about a foot from the tips of his fingers. The light causes shadows to grow around Ricky in the already dim cell, and casts his face into darkness. In the centre of this eeriness Ricky holds the arm out straight and turns it slightly this way and that, much as a blacksmith might inspect a newly created sword. Or alternatively, rather like a torturer checking the glowing heat at the tip of his poker before getting down to business.
'Now I want you to understand that I am not trying to intimidate you. I am not bluffing, either. I am just helping you understand the facts, because I'm really a fair-minded guy. The important fact now is that I'm fully capable of causing you extreme distress, and I am also prepared to do it. Consider this fact a gift which you can add to your grasp of the situation, so that you can be in no doubt that there's an easy way and a hard way for us to do this. You should *carefully* consider the merits of answering the nice lady's questions. That way, you can avoid answering mine.'
