# [Whitevale] Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-14 01:31:41)

The city begins to awaken as you all approach the militia office in the center of the city. Shopkeepers are opening up their stores, a few people walk the streets, and the city watch is changing shifts. You probably recognize more than a few faces from these categories and respond with whatever greetings you will.
You enter the office, which is no less busy. Guards are mulling about their business: receiving new orders, checking the watch schedules, and reporting to their commanders. You know that Erytios' office is down the main hall, which serves as a makeshift waiting-room for people who need to see the Protector-General and the other officers who work from the building.
You arrive a few minutes early to the meeting, and the man posted at Erytios' door informs you of this fact.

Samm arrived at the meeting and looked around.
*What is this meeting about in the first place? My time could be better served studying in the archives.*
Sighing to himself, Samm looked around for anyone he knew.

Gasarmis yawns, having just been woken up a few minutes ago, just in time to rush over for the meeting. He leans on his staff, eyes half closed and a generally tired appearance about him. He turns to the man standing next to him, Samm, and asks, "Hey, what is this meeting for again?"

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-16 10:43:17)

Samm looks at the visibly exhausted wizard next to him.
"I haven't the foggiest idea. And, why are you so tired? The sun's been up for at least ten minutes."

---

## Re: Prologue

### **zenkatarn** (2009-05-16 10:47:43)

"I've only been up for five." the Eladrin explains. "Also, I probably only got a few hours of sleep last night. I was studying in the school's library for most of the night." With that, Gasarmis yawns again.

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-16 10:53:38)

Samm nods to Gasarmis.
"You should be careful with studying by candle light. What good would you be to the militia if you're too tired to help out?"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **zenkatarn** (2009-05-16 10:58:33)

"I would have a retort, but I can't seem to think of one at the moment." Gasarmis yawns one more time, before saying, "Ah, enough of this." He holds his staff in front of himself and lights the top of in up, shining a very bright light into his eyes. The light goes out as he shouts, "AUGH! Gods, that hurts!" Shaking he head, he says to Samm, "Woke me up though. Hello, how are you this morning?"

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-17 02:58:28)

**Samm does not see anyone he knows personally. The village is small enough that he recognizes more than a few of the people going about the office, although he can not place any names.**

A few of the passers-by notice your cantrip and look a bit annoyed by the flash of bright light so early in the morning. The guard by the door shares this reaction.

He wasnÂ´t sure if he was late or early, but assumed that he was somewhat on time, as he noticed the two others in front of the building. As he walked closer, he watched the wizardÂ´s staff flare up with a brilliant light, and just as quickly dim out again. Judging from the reactions of the people around him, the light had been quite annoying. It was hard to judge though, as he carried the mysterious cloak around his shoulders, and the cloak seemed to play tricks with any light that came near it.
He hadnÂ´t looked around much as he came, trying to stay somewhat low-profile as he walked through the village. Sure, time had done its part in restoring his life in the village to closely normal, but he always attracted sullen and annoyed looks whenever he walked around. Which was why he chose to reside in his cabin at the outskirts of the village, or in the militia areas, as he was generally met with greater enthusiasm in there.
As he reached the building he gave a quick nod to the guard, and looked at the others.
"So, fresh and rested I see. Has anyone heard anything what this is all about?"

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-17 17:38:30)

"Nope, not yet. We're still waiting."
Samm looked around again, hoping that this meeting would get started and ended so he could return to his studies. The more he studied the methods on destroying the undead, the more he realized he needed to know.

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-21 23:40:57)

A few more minutes pass, and the doors in front of you open. An aged eladrin male, who you recognize to be Erytios, walks out of the room beyond and nods at the posted guard quickly. Turning to you, he spreads his hands out and smiles. "Ah, Good morning to you all! Please come inside." He beckons you into his office.

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-22 20:19:08)

Samm looks exasperated as he follows Erytios into the other room.
*I'd rather be studying.*

---

## Re: Prologue

### **zenkatarn** (2009-05-23 22:51:45)

Gasarmis, now fully awake, allows his inquisitive nature to take over as he follows Erytios and Samm inside. "Hey, hey! What's this meeting thing about?"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-24 02:22:19)

Erytios allows the group inside his office and nods toward the guard to close the door behind them. Skipping a beat, he addresses you all.
"Firstly, I'd like to congratulate you on your new promotions." Observing your probably-confused reactions for a second, he continues, "You are simple guards no longer. Henceforth, you comprise a band of warriors, protecting Whitevale from the monstrosities of the wilderness. Again, congratulations.
"Are there any questions before I issue your first orders?"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-24 14:03:57)

Samm sighs to himself.
*This will take away from my studies, **again**.*
Obviously Samm doesn't understand that one can achieve more learning in the field than in books alone.
"Is that what this meeting is about? A mission?"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-25 20:34:42)

Standing in the corner of the room against the wall, with the light-absorbing cloak he carries probably playing tricks with anyone looking at him, Zihark listens to what Erytios says.
*So, another band huh? LetÂ´s just hope this one fares better than the Blades*
Upon hearing the clerics comment, he muses to himself. The man had probably spent most his days holed up in the church or archives, trying to learn everything about the world from the tomes in there. Maybe this would be a good experience for him.
"The Protector-General would most likely not have assembled this team unless he thought the mission was more important than our everyday duties. And I am surprised to see a member of the clergy who would rather stay and rot in the archives than see the wider world, the one they are supposed to pass out divine wisdom into"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-25 21:17:19)

Samm turned a glare on the human in the corner as he heard his comment.
*What would you know, little man? Without doubt, you spend your time in judgment of others based solely on their martial skills, like so many narrow-minded fighters I have met in the past. You do not know the wonders of the written word. How could you with your limited intelligence?*
However, knowing his verbalized thoughts would end badly for him, Samm simply commented, "There is much to be learned from the wisdom of those who came before us, **friend**. Much of that wisdom has been lost because those who **could** pass it along, do not know it. They would rather spend their time in the 'wide world', as you put it, without that knowledge. So, it goes to waste, and sometimes people die because of that waste. I'd rather gather the knowledge first, then spread it around. But, that's just me."
Samm obviously feels a certain way about the military.

---

## Re: Prologue

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-25 21:41:57)

Zihark was a little surprised to see a cleric who seemed so quick to judge, and who appeared to have quite a temper as well.
"I am not arguing with you, but a wise cleric once told me this: You should never forget the past, and you should study it well, but not at the expense of taking part of the present and trying to shape the future. ThereÂ´s a reason we write scrolls and books you know. Because they *stay put* so that you can read them when the time comes. And there is only so much you can learn from books, the most valuable knowledge is the one gained from experience"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **zenkatarn** (2009-05-25 22:25:01)

Gasarmis looks first at Samm, then at Zihark. He then repeats this twice before saying, "Ok, this is not a good way to start a mission or whatever we are here for. You should both calm down and be friends." Gasarmis, his words of wisdom delivered, feels the need to ruin the mood by saying something stupid. Which he does, "Besides, everyone needs some excitement in their life!"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-26 12:35:57)

Samm looks over at the Eladrin with a raised eyebrow.
"Excitement **indeed**. However, there is wisdom here, at least in part. If we are to work together on whatever assignment we are given, we must not fight amongst ourselves."
Extending his hand towards the human, Samm still showed little emotion in his face.
"Samm of the Order of Pelor. And you are?"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-27 16:52:15)

Taking the clerics hand and offering a quick grip before taking his own back, Zihark looks at him with a slightly surprised look and a crooked smile.
"IÂ´m Zihark. You really must have been holed up in the archives for too long. I didnÂ´t think anyone in this village didnÂ´t know me and the things IÂ´ve done"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **zenkatarn** (2009-05-27 20:56:42)

Gasarmis puts his arms around the necks of the two humans and says, "And I'm Gasarmis, your local wizard and mood-lightener! Pleased to meet you."

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-28 01:11:06)

Erytios smiles at the conversation in front of him. *Better to let them work out their own differences instead of forcing it one them*, he thinks to himself.
"Good, now that introductions are out of the way, I'd like to give you your orders," he continues, his face looking a bit more grim. "The goblin tribe in the northern woods has been massing recently. What do you know about goblins?"
(*Refer to the OOC board for skill challenge rolls.*)

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-28 10:53:47)

Samm furrows his brow as he considers the histories his read and what he's learned about the goblins.
([**History check**](http://invisiblecastle.com/roller/view/2089154/ "http://invisiblecastle.com/roller/view/2089154/") = 1d20+5 = 14)

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-29 07:18:16)

After thinking it over for a second, Samm spoke out.
"Well, trust the book worm to come up with this bit of information, but the goblins are a fractured people, forming small tribes that just as much at war with themselves as with Whitevale. The only tribe recorded in history is the Breimend-dyn. It mostly consists of hobgoblins that a bit more civilized than the rest of the tribes. However, attempts at peace with even these people have been futile.
That's what I know about the matter, but, what do the rest of you know?"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-29 08:08:24)

Zihark shakes his head disturbingly at the news of the goblin tribes massing.
"It is true as you say, but it is worse than that. Pretty much the only thing keeping them from posing a serious threat to our village is the fact that they are torn apart by inner fighting, and lacks cohesion. So if they have started to mass together, that canÂ´t lead to anything good"
Straightening up instead of leaning on the wall, he checked the dagger in his belt, and looks at Erytios.
"I am not sure if this has any connection, but it seems quite likely to me. I heard that Balthasar has been missing for a couple of weeks now, and I guess everyone knows what that means when you travel around the wilderness surrounding our village. I have looked around closely around the village, but I have found no trace, and it wouldnÂ´t surprise me the goblins massing have something to do with his disappearance, or that of other militia veterans"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **zenkatarn** (2009-05-29 10:36:24)

Gasarmis looks at Samm, then Zihark, an expression of awe on his face. "Wow. You two sure know a lot. I didn't know any of that about goblins."

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-29 14:29:09)

Samm cocked an eyebrow at Gasarmis for a second.
*A wizard who never bothered studying history?*
Looking at Zihark; "If you're right, then this massing of the goblin tribes will only be bad for the town. What do you think, Zihark? If we were to find the new leadership of the northern goblin tribe and remove it, would the power vacuum recreate the chaos that once held sway?"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-29 16:09:56)

"Possibly. But if we are unlucky, whatever has dragged them together has united them enough so that such a removal would only stir them into an attack. If the leader is the sole catalyst however, then yes, removing him will most likely return them to their normal state of chaos"
He casts an eye towards Erytios.
"And I have a feeling that it is something along those lines you had in mind for us, am I right?"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-30 02:10:56)

Erytios can't help but flash a quick smile again. "It seems my faith in your abilities is well-placed, Zihark.
"Indeed, the recent activities of the goblin tribes is odd; it's just not in their nature. Indeed, it is a dark time of Whitevale; many of our veterans have met misfortune recently. There is no pride in my voice when I say my son and his Blades were integral in keeping the village safe from larger threats. In the past few months, monster movements have grown, and we've lost many veterans, such as Heskan's Wolves last month and Balthasar two weeks ago. Either the goblins are getting braver and smarter, or they know something we don't.
"But that's where you come in. Your primary orders are to investigate the northern woods, looking for goblins and wherever they are gathering. Any questions?"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-30 02:35:03)

Samm cleared his throat. "Is that **all** we're being asked to do? Or, should the opportunity present itself, are we to engage the goblins?"
While he imagined that the others might enjoy a romp through the mountains, Samm just really wanted to get back to his books and study some more. He disagreed with Zihark's assessment that the best things are learned in the real world. Were it not for his learning, he would never have known so many rituals that would undoubtedly come in handy during the mission that was taking him away from his studies.

---

## Re: Prologue

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-30 07:13:48)

Zihark canÂ´t help but feel a weight clutch around his heart when Erytios mentions his son. Suddenly the huge blade on his back feels even heavier, and he closes his eyes for a moment and draws a deep breath to keep the wave of memories from rushing over him. There was a hint of weary resignation in his voice as he answered.
"Just doing my job sir"
He turned towards Samm again.
"Do they keep bardÂ´s tales in those archives as well? What chance do you think the three of us would have to challenge an entire goblin tribe? They might not be smart, but they are many"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-30 08:29:07)

"Exactly why I asked the question. I didn't personally feel that a book worm priest, a goofy wizard with no studies of history, and a single soldier would actually stand a chance. I was just clarifying."
Samm shook his head. *Must this one always be so negative of scholars? I wonder what's up with that.*

---

## Re: Prologue

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-30 10:29:47)

"Very well, then I apologize. It sounded like you were suggesting the opposite"
Zihark closed his eyes again for a few moments as he felt a sudden instinct that told him that he could take them. That he should embrace that which he had been given. That he should release the power within.
*No, never…stay out of my head*
Steeling his mind and forcing the intruder away, he looked at Erytios.
"Anything else before we leave? No sense to be wasting time"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **zenkatarn** (2009-05-30 14:38:22)

"Hey! I studied history! Just not GOBLIN history." Gasarmis doesn't look particularly annoyed. He just likes people to be as accurate as possible. He then turns to the other Eladrin in the room and says, "No relevant questions, no. I'm all set!"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-31 15:13:36)

Samm shook his head. "No more questions from me, other than when do we leave?"
*The sooner we leave, the sooner we finish, the sooner I get back to my studies.*

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Sketchpad** (2009-06-07 21:22:35)

Dutch bursts into the room, practically out of breath and on the verge of exhaustion. He clumsily shuts the door and turns, his frame slumped as he manages to spat out, "<huff>**S-sorry ah-I'm late …** <huff> **I was … I was out taking care of some … of some chores and lost track of** <huff> **time**."
***Last time I try and out drink my uncle***, he thinks, starting to gain an ounce of composure.

---

## Re: Prologue

### **zenkatarn** (2009-06-07 21:37:56)

Gasarmis suddenly bursts out laughing. As he begins to calm down, he says, "Sorry, sorry. I just thought that if anyone was going to be late, surely it would be me! Please, carry on as though I had never said anything."

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-13 21:43:18)

Erytios blinks quickly, a bit suprised at the youth. "I see, Dutch. Well, then you'll need to have these fellows brief you on your orders."
To the group, he says "That being said, you dismissed. Good luck, and remember to stop by my office here to give me updates."

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Sketchpad** (2009-06-14 14:28:23)

Dutch nods to Erytios and turns towards the others, raising a hand in greeting. "**Hey guys**," he said with a wobbly smile. "**So … uhh … what're we doin'?**" Those close to him could smell the tavern wafting off from him. Though not drunk anymore, he still reeks of the bar, with ale and pipe smoke being the strongest of smells. Clumsily, he reaches back trying to find a wall and then slowly leaning against it to stabilize himself. ***Ugh***, he thinks. ***Time for some water … or maybe another ale. What's that old saying? Something, something … the Troll that bit you?***

---

## Re: Prologue

### **zenkatarn** (2009-06-14 15:33:09)

"Er...something to do with goblins...or something...?" Gasarmis scratches his head, trying to remember their orders. Finally, with an embarrassed grin, he says, "I kind of zoned out a bit, so I have no clue what we're supposed to be doing."

---

## Re: Prologue

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-06-14 16:19:19)

Zihark shook his head. What was this, a military unit or a group of the worst misfits found?
*At least the cleric seems to have his head on straight…*
Not feeling like wasting more time, and deciding to let them keep up as best they can, he starts for the door.
"WeÂ´re heading north. So do whatever you need to do quick, because we leave in fifteen minutes from the north gate"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-14 16:48:36)

Samm walks over, grabbing a glass from the table as he walks. Pulling out a few herbs from his various pouches and pouring some water, Samm makes a concoction that would probably make an orc turn his nose up in disgust. Holding out the odiferous liquid to the boy that smelled like a tavern (in particular the latrine part), Samm simply smiled.
"Here. Have a drink. It'll clear up your head in no time flat. And, since we're kind of in a hurry, if you refuse to drink it, I can ask Zihark over there to hold you down while I pour it down your gullet. Your choice."
Samm just didn't tell him that Dutch wouldn't be able to hold down any ale for a day or so after drinking the liquid. It would probably make the mission go smoother, though.

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Sketchpad** (2009-06-16 12:36:53)

Dutch nodded to Gasarmis. "**Gobs, eh?**" he questioned. "**At least it isn't kobolds. I hate those little scale-lickers. Always chittering and barking like they're bigger than they are …**" He trailed off for a moment at the mention of kobolds, but quickly snapped out of it when Zihark spoke to him. "**What's that now? North?**" Dutch checked himself over. ***Sword?*** He thought. ***Check. Stickers? Check. Tools?*** His eyes went big for a moment, realizing quickly that his tools were in his pack with a sigh of relief. ***Whew, check.*** He gave Zihark the thumbs up. "**Ready.**"
Looking to Samm, he takes the glass with a smile, saying, "**Oh, thanks … much obliged**," he said with a smile ... that is till he raised it to his mouth. The smile quickly vanished as his face twisted in distaste. Before even drinking, he could smell the stink of the brew and moved it as far from him as possible. "**And here I thought we were supposed to work together, not poison one another.**" Dutch carefully placed the glass on a table, careful not to spill it for fear that it might eat the floor. "**Keep your concoctions to yourself …**"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **zenkatarn** (2009-06-16 18:13:07)

Gasarmis taps his staff against the floor a few times in impatience, sarcastically saying, "Whenever you two are ready." He does not, however, wait for them and immediately follows Zihark.

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-17 00:02:39)

Samm looked down at the concoction that Dutch had put back on the table and sighed.
*Why can't people just understand that medicine is **not** always, if ever, pleasant? Now he's forced my hand.*
Looking over at Dutch, Samm made one last plea.
"Oh quit your worrying, you big baby! It'll sober you up and it's **not** poison. It's just some herbs meant to clear your head. We don't need to be heading into goblin territory with a member of the party hung over."
Picking up the glass, Samm offered it back to Dutch.
*I really hope that Zihark'll help me out on this one if needed. I don't want to have to save this guy later in the mountains because he's hung over.*
Samm's inexperience is still showing. Anyone with experience in the world would have known that nothing clears the head like a goblin arrow in the shoulder or buttocks.

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Sketchpad** (2009-06-17 09:09:08)

Dutch looked at Samm and then to the "drink". "**I don't think so," he said, "it'll take more than some simple goading to get me to drink that witch's brew.**" Hearing Gasarmis' impatience, he cracks his neck a little and begins making his way to the door. "**Okay … okay … let's go kill some Goblins …**"

---

## Re: Prologue

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-17 09:27:05)

Sighing, Samm put the drink back down on the table.
*I'm going to have to save that man later on today.*
Following the others out of the room, Samm did a quick check to make sure everything was where it should be.
