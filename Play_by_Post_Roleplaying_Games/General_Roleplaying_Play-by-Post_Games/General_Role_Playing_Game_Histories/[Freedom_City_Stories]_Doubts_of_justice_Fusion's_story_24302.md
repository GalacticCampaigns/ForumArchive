# [Freedom City Stories] Doubts of justice : Fusion's story

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-31 09:31:35)

The time has come.
Money isn't an issue anymore. The time has come for Davis to get out in the world and seek his family.
His most solid lead was about a gang. One of his brother had been taken by the recluses, a gang a sociopathic murderers who ruled over part of greenbank. His informations don't give him any more details than this. But he is ready, time has come.

The merger was complete.All documents were signed, the board members were still shaking hands and smiling as he left the plush office. All in all, Davis was pleased with the purchase of the small auto company. He already knew what changes he would make to operations of the company, and though there would be some lay offs, he was confident that his employment agencies- carefully hidden behind multiple front companies- will find suitable jobs for those that were let go. He didn't expect much of a profit to come from this purchase, but it was a *good* thing. That was the important part.
His shoes clacked lightly on the brown stone tiles- buffed to a mirror shine, he noticed, and made a mental note to give the cleaning crew a raise- as he strode down the halls of his district office. He smiled pleasantly to those he passed, stopping to answer questions, and accepting praise for his newest acquisition, even as minor as it was. Some of it was subtle brown nosing, but most was honest happiness of his success. While he could care less about any praise, he did care about honesty. It was the cornerstone his business was based on. Absolute honesty. No stealing, no taking credit for some one else's work, no promotions based on personal friendships, no claiming more hours than you worked. Honest work, for an honest pay.
On that thought, he looked at his watch. Upon his desire to know the time, it was displayed in his vision, snatched from a nearby computer and projected by the retinal display. His watch was a few seconds off from the atomic clock in Greenwich, England, and showed he had several hours before the...meeting he had planned for later that evening. Plenty of time for one of his famous 'walkabouts'. He nodded to the security guard at the elevators, lifted his name from the security agent's mind. "Bert, Davis said with a pleasant grin. "Good to see you up and about. How is the little girl? The kidney took, I take it?"
"Sir?" the guard replied, caught halfway between a smile for being recognized, and shock from the details. "Oh, yes, she is doing well. Doctors said the operation was good, and she'll be right as rain in a few more days." Bert smile became full, and Davis felt the man's loyalty swell. Davis nodded, and probed the other man's mind for an appropriate response, and found a phrase Bert's father used.
"Good. Take care of that girl, now. Children, our future, and all that," Davis said, and walked into the elevator. Bert was pleased at the comment, and began to wonder where he had heard that term before. Davis left him wondering and selected floor filled with offices. Four floors down, he began his 'walkabout'. Floor by floor, room by room, Davis walked through the whole building, letting his mind touch each and every worker in the area. He sought out any attempt at fraud, theft, and lying. He stopped to make small talk with the section leaders, lifting personal information from their minds to create the illusion he kept tabs on them personally. Twice, he made suggestions on personnel arrangements, and both managers were pleased that he suggested the very thing they were considering. Only once did he find any wrong doing- dipping from the petty cash fund- and sought out the mind responsible for the act. Mary Tagget, a single mother of two and a wizard with personnel directories, had needed a few more dollars to make bills meet that month, he discovered, due to her ex-boyfriend ripping all four tires of her car. Frank Johnson, the floor manager and excellent boss, was covering for her. He had a short conversation with Frank, hinting at knowing about the missing funds, and then told Frank "Oh, yes, I will be flying to our French division. I'll be taking Silvie with me, let her run around in their records and see where that profit screw up is. Since she's in charge of division personnel records, and i just can't leave that area unattended, do you know know anyone good with records that wouldn't mind division level pay for a week?"
The rest fell into place easily. Business settled, Davis turned to a more serious business. Family.
Hours later, wearing the face of reckless Jack Smith (a far cry from the pleasant professional, Davis Mathom) and comforted by the presence of his drones, he climbed out of his Impala. Red, the crimson painted drone, followed him out of the car silently, projecting a protective field around it's master. Yellow, Blue, and Brown circled him, their electronic eyes scanning the area for threats, while Green drifted in the skies above, giving Davis the option for an overhead view, should he want it. All had their cloaking fields only, and were unseen by the naked eye, but Davis was still reassure by their presence. They were his only real link to his origins. A past he would reclaim, and forge into a future. *But, the key to that,* he thought, *is running late.* Not that he expected anything different. Britney Charlie was *always* late.
The woman who had helped him find his purpose in life had grown from a gawking street rat and adoptive mother of six to an expert thief and con artist mother of twenty four. In thanks for her unknown help, he kept in contact with her, and later, when he had money, insured her family was taken care of. Nothing directly, as Davis knew she would never accept kindness or pity, but in quiet ways, like keeping the soup kitchens in the area well stocked, and along with the free clinics of that neighborhoods. The publicity from Davis Mathom's support of the poor and homeless helped divert notice away from his Jack persona, the only one Light Fingers knew.
She had first told him of the gang, and further digging solidified the lead. The gang, this bloodthirsty group of thugs held one of his family in captivity, or knew where one was. Their movements were unpredictable, a behavior likely brought on by the numerous heroes that populated the city. Britney told him she could find out where the gang was currently calling home, and promised that information tonight. She didn't ask what he wanted the gang for, but made him promise to be careful when dealing with them. He, in turn, required the same promise. "I can take care of myself," she said with a grin. "Don't you worry about me."
'Jack' returned the smile. "I can take care of myself. Don't you worry about me."

The adress she gave him was a warehouse location over in greenbank, from what she told him there would be half a dozen member of the gang there tonight. All that was left was for him to get there.

Choosing stealth over brawn, Davis drove to the warehouse district, parking oat a convenience store some blocks distant. In his 'Jack' persona, he walked the streets, still protected by the drone he called Red. Green and Yellow were sent ahead, checking each cross street and alley for trouble, while Brown took over overhead-and-over-watch some distance above the streets. Blue he kept at the car, as the best anti-theft system he owned.
The gray and brown buildings were in stark contrast to the business district blues and whites, with the sparse, dead grass, broken pavement, and sweat strained air conflicting with the manicured lawns, smooth streets, and clean air he had grown accustomed to of late. He had come far, since his childhood days, he reflected, and soaked in the alien-yet-familiar sensations of the area. Well saturated in the upper class world his businesses provided and required, he wondered how often he would be drawn into the darker corners of the city.
As he closed with the appointed warehouse, he opened his mind feeling out the immediate area for creatures of thought. A few late night workers, several packs of rats, a student slipping through the darkness greeted in cerebral glance, matching the data he already sensed. He looked further out, seeking the gang he was expected to find, and, more importantly, a mind that felt like home.

Inside the warehouse Davis sensed a dozen different minds, none of them felt familiiar.
From aleys on each side of him, green and yellow warned him of the presence of two thugs per alley, trying to hide themselves.

*Guards? Odd,* he thought. *What are they doing that they need guards?* Keeping his head down and his walk steady, Davis continued toward the warehouse, haphazardly choosing a path that would bring him next to his intended target and then beyond it, creating the illusion it wasn't his goal. As for the guards...he dipped into their mind, confident only another telepath would sense his intrusion, and sought out their purpose. His own security forces rarely knew what they were guarding- an one rarely put on guard some one important enough secrets- but Davis felt it was better to check than not.
As he closed with the warehouse, he sought out his own image in the scattered minds, searching for anyone who could see him. *Invisibility*, he mused, *was easy when no one was looking*. He would find a place to secret himself- provide he made it by the guards- and use his senses and that of his drones to ferret out any hint of his family. From there...he would see.

Nothing of interest came from the warehouse, but the mind of the three of the guard resonated with his image and an intent to cause harm. Green and yellow briefly warned him that they had started moving in his direction.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-08-16 12:17:27)

*That settles it,* he thinks, sensing the thug's dark thoughts. *Time for preventive medicine.* Without looking toward the guards, Davis sends his mental orders his drones, putting them into action. Brown drops from it's overhead position to join to join Green and Yellow. Almost simultaneously, the three drones drop their visual cloak and release nearly invisible bolts of force, each one targeting a different thug.
As the soundless TK bolts shoot to their targets, Davis already worked out the rest of the plan: once the thugs were rendered unconscious, the drones will drop them into a dumpster, and over turn it. With a little luck, the guards be trapped for a bit, and stay out of sight for as long as he needed. With the drones attacking from concealment, from above, the guards might not even know what hit them. And that suited Davis just fine.

Overconfidence had caused Davis to msicalculate, there had been four guards, even if one had escaped his notice, the probe managed to drop down the three guard thet davis had noticed, but not the fourth. As soon as he saw his friends being taken down, the remaining guards started screaming for help, from the warehouse sounds of footseps sounded.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-08-18 03:43:01)

*Well…crap.* Davis cursed silently. Now what? This was not part of the plan. Still, all was not lost. The still conscious thug may see the drones, but there wasn't any evidence that they were linked to Davis. The telepath ordered Brown to take out the last thug, and then to gain altitude. As the drone complied, the man did a quick look for easy hiding spot. It had to be close- he only had seconds to find suitable cover- but the illumination didn't matter much- Green and Yellow would shatter two lights nearly as fast as Davis could think it. But he wasn't a brawler, and he wasn't about to go toe to toe with a gang, even if he was cloaked in Red's protective field.
*Speaking of which,* Davis thought as he dashed for cover, and instructed Red to cover him. *Better safe then in the hospital.* 
((Find a spot to hide, breaking lamps if necessary to let the night hide me, Brown nails last thug, the shoots straight up into the night- single move until ordered to do something else- while Green and Yellow try to gain altitude to disappear into the night sky but remain close enough to blast light bulbs- error on the side blasting light bulbs.))

Luckily Davis manages to hide in a dark corner behind some crates while a dozen more thugs get out of the warehouse, looking around them for signs of trouble. When they spot their friends down on the ground they rush toward them, away from the warehouse, leaving the door open behind them.

*Oh, goodie,* the business man thinks, slipping from his hiding place and slipping to the door while the thugs backs are turn. He ordered Brown to reengage it's cloak, and hover over the doorway. Red and Yellow, equally masked from sight, were pulled in close to protect their master while Green was sent ahead- inches from the ceciling, to spot any more guards. *Let's see, plan as we go…slip in, find a place to hide, read minds. Yep, that sounds like a plan to me.*
As he entered the building, Davis remembered a line he had heard in a movie: *A plan is a list of things that don't happen.*

*…seriously, I need to work on my plans.* He looked up, further down the street. Then he looked behind, as if looking for the person the gang was looking for. Then, as if suddenly aware the thugs were talking to him, he stopped and let the color drain from his face. Slowly, shaking, he raised his finger to point at himself. "M-m-me?"
Mentally, he doubled checked that Red was maintaining the force field. Yellow was brought close enough to yank him out of the way, should the worst happen. Brown and Green were sent through the door maneuvering through the building to reach the wall directly behind and above Davis. If it came to it, Davis would use shattered chunks of wall raining down as yet another distraction.

"Man, I just don't know. I was like, looking...looking for some *stuff*, ya know? And I heard some yelling, and- man, I just wanted to get outta here," Davis said, letting his own worry of getting into a brawl with these brutes leak into his voice. He knew his normal look was rough enough that he wouldn't look too out of place, especially in the dark. The telepath really wanted to take a look in the building, see what gathered the gang together in *this* location, but he wanted them to have a reason to remember his face even more. Time was on his side, and if it came to it, he would hunt them down tomorrow.
Quickly, he checked on the progress the drones were making in the building, and at the same time, delved into the surface thoughts of this gang. They believed him, he was sure, but further lies would need- or at least benefit from- knowing what they expected him to say. "Man, I never should have come down here. But I heard this place was a...ya know, cops don't come here. That kind of place. Um, safe, ya know?"

"Not, not...join," he replied, acting as if mulling the thought over. Which wasn't far from reality. He really was thinking about it. Joining, or even pretending to join, he could find out what he needed to know. If they took him in doors, anyhow. "Just, ya know, looking to score. I ain't trying to cause no trouble. If you ain't got it, you ain't got it, an' I'll just..." he let his hands shake a little as they waved away from the gathering crowd and toward the dark streets.
"But, hey, you guys, uh, you guys got an opening?" P*ortraying some one with a drug addled mind wasn't hard as a genius,* he thought. *But requires just as much focus and concentration.* "You need like a look-out, or a, ya know, carrier or something?"

"Uh...bait?" *This* wasn't what Davis had in mind, at all. However, it wasn't like he was in any danger. With Red maintaining the Force Field, and Yellow right close, there really wasn't anything the gang should be able to do to him. *The key word in that sentence is should,* Davis thought.
"Uh, yeah. Sure. I can do that," Davis said, trying to present an image of a druggie hoping for his next score, and delibrately not asking who and what he was baiting, as if the what didn't matter, on the reward did.
He did a quick check on other drones, and hoped they were getting close. "You think after, I could, I mean, you could hook me up?"

Adopting his best I'm-suppose-to-be-on-guard-but-I'm-really-just-this-side-of-panicking look, and went about directing those drones in the building to look around. If one of his brothers were there, Davis swore to find him.

"Oh, okay, sure," Davis replied, trying to act as dejected as he could despite the thrill of discovery coursing through him. A powerful mind...Davis knew he would have to get a stronger connection, perhaps even removing the drugs that riddled the mind's body, before he knew for sure it was one of his brothers. But that didn't matter. It was a lead, a chance, a hope. That's all that mattered.
Turning, he walked away, his mind a furious whirlwind of activity. His own mental senses locked on to the thugs closest to him, while he directed Brown to locate the most direct route between the rest of the gang and Davis, and prepared to close- and keep closed- that door. Green hunted out the powerful mind, and Red...*you keep that force field on me,* he thought to the drone. *Yellow, take this one-* he indicated the thug that was the most out of sight from the rest. *And then this one, then this one.* 
With enough luck, these four will be taken out quietly, and he can search the building with a few ounces of stealth. If not...*things will get broken*.

As Yellow drug the bodies out of the light, Davis stared down at one of the gang members. *Tall, dark, bald from a recent hair cut but with a chin bristling with fuzzy. Burly, too. Steroid use? The height, though. That'll hurt.* Slowly at first, then with increasing quickness, Davis's features warped and twisted, expanding and twisting, darkening and mutating. His arms bugled, his forehead sloped, and his face contorted, until he was the prefect imitation of the gang member before him. Even his clothes changed to match the intimidating style of the brute. Davis stopped to roll the unconscious body over and remove the man's jacket.
Smiling, Davis dug into the unconscious minds of the thugs Yellow was dumping into a nearby dumpster, seeking behavior cues and unseen tattoos. Once completed, he ordered Yellow to flip the dumpster- quietly as it could, on it's side, and against the wall.
Walking quickly- he didn't want to look like he was rushing somewhere, should he be watched, but he was too excited not to- he entered the building, proceeded by Yellow, and followed by Red, both cloaked for safety.
*I really ought to think about hooking up some sort of field to them, so they can cloak me,* Davis thought. He was hesitant to do any modifications, however. They were one- *well, five*- of a kind, and replacing them would be problematic at best.
Brown was ordered to leave the door, and began to map out the building, focusing on the route between Davis and the drugged mind. Green was still searching for the physical body that that mind. Davis cursed himself for his lack of planning, of preparation, and impulsiveness.
*I should have flown over head. I should have had some sort of concealing power built into the drones. I should stop, let the drones find the mind. I should lock onto that mind, scan it deep, and find out if it's even one of my brothers. I should wait until I got a good lock, then freakin' tele-view it. I* shouldn't *be rushing forward, without back up, personal security, and rolling head long into the lion's den on a stupid hunch!*
But he went anyway, throwing out his senses for that elusive collection of drunk thoughts, moving forward with purpose and without stealth, once more walking like he owned everything in sight. He was the scared druggie no more.
*After this is done, I'm buying this building. And renovating it.*

*That brain is weird,* he thought as he approached the door way. Quickly, he scanned the two thugs minds, and looked for what they expected of the form her was wearing. Using that information, he greeted them, and hunted up when the next shift was suppose to should up, planned radio checks, and checked where his drones were.
He also turned around and walked out. This wasn't his family, and wasn't his problem. He already had more than enough surprises in this trek, and the prize wouldn't be what he was after. *Do I just wants something to show for this?* he wondered. *Or do I want revenge for what happened to us? To my family? Or is it something else?*
As he prepared to in act, a grim thought tickled in, one he stomped out. *Could this be just another of Dark Mind's plans?*

Taking no chances, Davis summoned Yellow, Green, Red and Brown close to him. A quick set of commands linked the four into pairs, and each pair one of the thugs. As the charges built up in the drones, preparing to discharge, Davis thought about the strange alien mind.
*Are you human?* he wondered. *When I free you, will you attack? They caged you for a reason; is it a reason I would agree with? Will you be able to help me with my family? Are you worth the time I spent on this?*
Dark thought came and the telekinetic bolts were released toward the unsuspecting thugs. *You had better not have anything to do with Dark Mind.*

You had best be worth it, Davis thought to the unknown being, careful to keep those thoughts within his own mind. Still, despite his caution, he couldn't help by snarl at the captured man. With a viciousness rarely tapped, he ordered the drones to rip the tank apart, grabbing the man before he fell.
Using the mental map Green had built, Davis plotted his escape through the nearest window; no need for stealth, anymore. With one drone to carry each Davis and the unknown creature, and another to provide the force field, Davis headed out...

*Okay…now what?* Davis looked at the creature he carried in askance, as if the unconscious form could answer an of his questions. If the individual had been one of his brothers, he would had flown home. But he wasn't about to take this into his life. No, this was an outsider, a distraction, that had no place in his mission.
He left Yellow and Green with the powerful mind, floating several hundred feet in the night air. Brown and Red were instructed to carry him a few hundred yards away from his car, landing out of sight of any observers. Shifting to his 'Jack' form, he headed back to his car, his mind scanning for any watchers out of habit than care.
*Get my car, get Blue, get under the rest of the drones, get the creature, and then…*he stroked his chin. Hospital? He liked the idea, until he thought that perhaps the gang would look for his...what are you? Davis wondered briefly. Are you a threat? Are you anything? But that train of thought was pointless.
He had to consider, however, if this strange telepath could be a danger. The gang kept him drugged and in stasis. When he woke, he might be angry, and lash out. Powerful minds, like Davis's, could do terrible things to a lot of people. Davis himself could, with effort, drop everyone with several hundred yards. If he practiced, he knew could manipulate those minds in a more horrible fashion- erase memories, cause nightmare, even twist those minds to mirror the monstrosities of serial killers and psychopaths. *It's what Dark Mind had made us for,* he thought grimly. *It's what I could have become.*
*So, no hospital.* He might risk the local super hero head quarters. Contact them, tell them what he found and...*not right now. I have to talk to him. See what he knows. Made plunge the depths of his mind.* Sighing with resignation Davis climbed in his car, pulled the GPS system and punched in a request for motels. Something just out of town, and hopefully run down enough to he wouldn't have to worry about privacy.

After finding and getting to the shabby motel outside of freedom, Davis and his drones carried the unconscious man into one of the room.

*Who are you?*, Davis wondered, staring at the unconscious figure on the room's only bed. Since Davis had never needed any amount of sleep, the arrangement was only noted in passing. He had already changed his form once more, this time appearing as a sharply dressed executive, appearing exactly like someone who was sent to deal with problems that didn't fall in a 'business as usual' portfolio. *Are you one of Dark Mind's creations? Are you part of his plots? Do you know Hard Drive? What about my brothers? Where did you come from? Why were you in the tank?*
The three of the drones were hovering invisibly near the sleeping form, carefully monitoring him for signs of stirring, prepared to attack the unknown creature and protect their master, if necessary. Not for the first time, Davis wished he had more of the drones. But the control matrix implanted into his skull was limited, and any more drones would be unmanageable. *I'll just have to work on upgrading them*, Davis decided. As an afterthought, he checked on Yellow and Red, who were guarding his car and conducting low altitude over-watch on the building.
*I could wait until you wake up,* he thought to himself, staring at his subject, *or we can use the quick way. As I'm an anti-social prick, which way do you think we're gonna go with?* The sole chair in the room was spun around to face the bed. The telepath sat on the chair backward, crossing his arms on the back of the chair, and stared at the man. Delicately, slowly, he entered the sleeping mind to see what he could find.

Questions the Mind Probe:
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I don't know how long I can do the questions and answer bit, or even if Mind Probe works on unconscious people- or this creature- but I'm gonna try. Since the books describes Mind Probe as 'getting an answer to a single question, I'll just list the questions:
*Who are you?
What are you?
Do you know Dark Mind* (provide a visual and mental memory of Dark Mind, just in case this mind had mentally 'felt' the villain before)*? And what is he to you?
Do you know Hard Drive* (as above)*? And what is he to you?
Do you know my brothers? Have you heard any rumors about them?
Do you know Britney "Light Hands" Charlie? Are you a danger to her?*
And, if he can get through all of that, he continues with:
What do you need?
Where do you want to go?
Who do you trust?
