Freedom city ! The town of thousand wonders, and probably as many superheroes.
The boat diamondback took to get there finaly reaches it's destination, passing under the ever watchful gaze of the sentry, the giant statue of centurion, earth greatests hero, before finaly reaching pier two and beyond it, the bustling metropolis.
Once on shore Diamondback is left alone in the middle of the mass of peoples with nothing but a letter and a vague idea about her new lodging in the fens, wherever that may be.

"Bon Jour!" Diamondback called out to random people, as she hefted her military style duffel over her shoulder. Being former military, she'd learned to travel light, and everything she owned was in that rucksack, and was mostly clothing and a few photos of former squad mates. She was already wearing the snakeskin boots, daisy duke shorts, and snakeskin print corset she felt was proper attire for America. At least that's what the cowboy who gave her the nickname diamondback had told her.
Once again she pulled out the letter, and re-read it.

Diamondback re-read the letter again, the confirmation of her french citizenship and her release from the legion.
Peoples around her look at her with a suspicious glance, her attire is not at all common among the peoples of freedom and her enthusiasm seems out of place.
Soon however the gaze are averted and the crowd resume his wandering.

Diamondback shrugs, as the implants in her feet generates an energy disk, and she slowly raised up into the air, and heads in the direction of the Fens to find her apartment. The French Hero was used to more attention then this, and was slightly disappointed.

As diamondback rise and then flies trough the air, peoples starts looking up. Yet they don't express the same kind of attention or interest to wich she is used.
Whithin a minute of taking her flight, diamondback notices a column of smoke erupting from a building to the south.

### **Avarna** (2009-07-21 15:26:12)

Diamondback turns and heads towards the south and the smoke. There was little she could do in case of a fire, but she needed to do what she was able too. After all, this was as good a way to start building her reputation in Freedom City as any.

Reaching the building, Diamondback realize that the place is on fire.
If that wasn't enough, two peoples appears to be trapped in the highest level shooting for help by the window and various journalists crews are present.
The firemaen on the floor can't reach the highest level, as is often the case with tall building and whitout action, the couple is doomed to a certain death.

Diamondback guided her energy disk over to the window. "Bon Jour. You'd like some assistance, Qui?"
She hadn't tried to carry multiple people on the Energy Disk before, but held out her hand to help the man out the window, instructing him to put his feet on top of her feet. Then it was the woman's turn to simply cling to both Diamondback and the man, as she lowered the entire group to the ground.

Two peoples prove to be too heavy for Diamondback ability to remain afloat.
Instead of flying down slowly and gently as she planned, the three of them pummel to the ground at high speed.
She has only a few seconds to try and come up with a solution.

"Baiser!" Diamondback calls out when she realized she'd taken on more weight then her energy disk could support. Closing her eyes, she tries to focus as much energy as the implants had into simply support the weight of the two additional people, to get them safely to the ground.

((Don't try to translate fuck litteraly, it's not used that way in french. Say Putain or merde.))
The energy Diamondback use to supercharge her implants makes her energy disks glow brighter for a few seconds, long enough for her to reach the floor whitout any further problem.
As soon as she touches the ground a swarm of reporter surround her, questions erupting every wich way.
The firemen on the other seems rather unphazed by the occurence and focus on trying to keep the fire under control as much as possible.
The reporters swarms Diamondback while the couple she rescued thanks her profusly.
"Who are you ?" Where do you come from ?" Are you responsible for this fire ?" are among the hundreds of question being launched at diamondback by the journalists.

"No. I didn't set the Fire." Was Diamondback's immediate answer to what she felt was the most pressing question. "I'm Diamondback, I just arrived from France. I'm afraid I won't answer any more questions about my past at this time."
Diamondback then glances over at the couple, smiling at them. She's thankful that they weren't injured. She then turns her attention to the fire itself, and frowns. Short of leveling the building none of her powers would actually help to put it out. So turning to the reporters once more she says, "I'm afraid there is nothing I can do to help fight the fire. So, I will do the next best thing, and stay out of the way of those that can."
With that she reactivates the energy disk, and starts to fly up into the air, and returns to her original course of finding her new apartment.

The flashes of camera pursue her as she rise in the air again, with reporters still sprouting questions at Diamondback.
A few minutes later she finaly reaches her new appartement in the fens.
The fens is not by far the most pleasent place she has ever been to, nor is it the worse.
The landlord quickly show her to her appartement, warning her to not break anything and that the rent is to be paid weekly.
He also hand her a letter emanating from the French governement asking her to report to the embassy as soon as possible.

((What kind of apartment is it? A Studio? One Bedroom? Two Bedroom? Is it furnished? Does Diamondback need to purchase something to sleep on tonight?))
((Just a suggestions Berior, but Start to think more like a story writer. If you put more detail into a post, then I won't have to ask for that detail and thus speeds things along.))
Diamondback thanks the Landlord for the mail and showing her to her apartment. She smiles, before double checking that there was a good lock on the door, and making a mental note to get it changed anyway. She then checked her watch, to see what time of day it was, and see if there was still time to to to the consulate before nightfall.

The appartement is small but well cleaned and furnished, one bedroom with a small kitchen.
Upon looking at her watch, diamondback summerize that there is indeed more than enough time left to show up at the ambassy.
The trip is uneventful and diamondback lands on the small backyard of the embassy whitout trouble. However when she does she is quickly challenged by the guards. They stand down as soon as she show them her credentials and the letter asking her to show up.
A man who is so painfully part of the secret service show her inside and escort her trough the lavishly decorated embassy to the office of the ambassador.
The ambassador is a man in his late 50's, energetic and standing upright and proud, he turn toward diamondback and start talking to her in french.
"We caught signs of your exploits. You are already making yourself known. This is a good thing. You might be interested to learn that the building who caught fire was housing several of the peoples working in our embassy, it would seems someone is targeting us. We want you to take care of it"

Diamondback streched out an yawned as she lounged on a sofa in the Ambassador's office, taking polite sips of a red wine an aide had offered. She listened to what the man had to say. The woman knew she couldn't refuse, as that would lead to her diplomatic immunity being revoked, and that this sort of thing was exactly why the French Government wanted her here.
"Yes, of course." She replies swiftly and with a smile Replying in French. "I don't me to be discourteous, but one Fire doesn't mean much. Unless things are suspicious. Have there been other incidents? Is there anyone specific you think is connected?"

"We have received letters" The ambassador reaches into his desk and hands a file to diamondback inside wich are letter written with cut pieces of paper. Each of them menacing the ambassy and France.
The fourth letter in particular mention how the french are all going to burn.
"We have of course analysed these but we couldn't find any traces or fingerprints. However our surveillance camera have picked up this man." He then hands her a pictures of a middle aged man.
"Nicholas Rourke, he was called Nero a few years ago, a pyrokinetic arsonist, Centurion himself arrested him but he never stood trial. They said he was insane, he spent some time in an asylum and was released a few years ago, cured. We have to know if he was responsible for what happened or not."

"Nero," Diamondback repeated the name, as she took the photo and looked it over, committing the man's image to memory. She then tucked it into her pocket, and looked over the letters, she doubted she'd notice anything about them the investigators missed. (Search +7)
"You'll contact me right away if another letter arrives, or any suspicious occurs." Diamondback replies taking charge of the situation. "If there is nothing else, I'll take my leave."

Her examination of the letter produce no visible clue for her.
The ambassador quickly agrees to her demands and soon the guards come inside to escort her back out of the embassy.
The question was, what to do now.

## Re: Spotlight and rescues : Diamondback story

### **Avarna** (2009-08-05 09:53:02)

Diamondback knew exactly what to do. Once she was clear of the Embassy, the pulled out her cell phone and started to dial. "Hello? Yes, Its me. How have you been? Listen, I need to call in that favor you owe me..."
(Using my connected feat (diplomacy +7) to try to get as much information on Nero as she can)

Her contact ask her to wait and call him back half an hour later, when she does he tell her that he managed to secure parts of Nero psychiatric evaluation, apparently his powers are higly dependent on his mental state, by the time he had been cured from his pyromania and megalomania his powers had disapeared.

## Re: Spotlight and rescues : Diamondback story

### **Avarna** (2009-08-06 10:35:00)

"I see, Thank you very much." Diamond back replied to her contact. So far everything she's found says that he has been successfully treated for his mental illness. That doesn't completely clear Nero from the fire, and she'll still go though the effort to track him down.
She didn't waste the half hour she needed to wait to call her contact back. She returned to the Fire she saved people from earlier. Hoping that the fire was out, and that perhaps the fire investigator was on the scene.

When diamondback reach the scene of the fire she find the building smoldering, the fire having been put out an hour earlier.
The police is still on the scene as well as peoples from the insurance company.
She quickly locate the fire investigator inside the building who turn towards her as she approaches.
"so you're the one who pulled those two peoples outta the building ? Nice job."

### **Avarna** (2009-08-08 15:57:23)

"Qui, Merci." Diamondback replies with her best smile to the fire inspector. She comes to stand beside him, and looks at what he was recently looking at. "Several of the occupants of the building where employees at the French Consulate. I've been asked to investigate it upon they're behalf. Have you figured out how it started?"
(Diplomacy +11 assuming the inspector is male)

"Well" says the man "the fire was definitly criminal, it started nowhere near anything very flamable or that could have accidently caused a spark. What's strange though is that we find no trace of any accelerant and yet the fire spread faster than any normal fire could."

## Re: Spotlight and rescues : Diamondback story

### **Avarna** (2009-08-10 16:10:45)

"I see." Diamondback replied with a sigh. Truly she didn't want to deal with a pyrokinetic arsonist, Especially one that had just recently been "cured." She'd been hoping that the fire investigator would have been able to give her a more mundane suspect to chase.
"I'm afraid that information fits for the suspect that I have. Here is my cell number. Should you find anything else, please call me." She replied giving the inspector the number for her cell phone. "Have there been any other incidents like this that might form a pattern?"

"No, at least nothing recent, we do have unexplainable fire from time to time, but in a city with so many goddamn powered supervialin it's to be expected, there hasn't been a case recently."

## Re: Spotlight and rescues : Diamondback story

### **Avarna** (2009-08-12 15:30:17)

Diamondback nods slowly. Everything she had just been told points to Nero. But what did he have against the French Government? What had happened since his release that has caused him to relapse into these destructive patterns? Its it Nero or has someone else inherited his powers?
"Thank you for your time." She said to the Inspector, before walking away and around the corner. Her Energy disk taking her above the rooftops. Diamondback was deep in thought, as she started to make her way back to the Fens, and her apartment. She was going to have more calls to make.

The flight back to her appartements is uneventful, the night falling over the city who illuminates with countless star like point of ligth, from the sky, it is not unlike looking at the heavens. the illusion is spoiled only by the bustle of activity and the noises of the city life.

## Re: Spotlight and rescues : Diamondback story

### **Avarna** (2009-08-15 23:22:25)

When Diamondback returned to her apartment, she takes out her Video camera, and begins to make an entry in the video journal she'd kept since she'd purchased the device. She spoke in French, being more comfortable with that language then her true native language English.
"I reached Freedom City, and immediately was rushed into the rolls of a "Hero," There was a fire burning down an apartment building that housed a number of employees for the French Consulate in the city. I only found this out, after making my way to speak with the Ambassador. I saved two people from burning to death.
"I'm already earning my keep. There had been a number of threatening messages sent to the consulate. The last one they received clearly threatening the fire. The only suspect I have is Nicholas Rourke, also known as Nero. A pyrokinetic arsonist, recently released from psychological care. Security footage places him at the Embassy about the time the last message was delivered. After speaking to the fire investigator, I can safely say the fire was indeed Arson, And that it wasn't started by ordinary means.
"Several questions come to mind. What has caused him to relapse? How is the French involved? Where is he now? And most pressing, will I be able to find him before he sets another fire?"
Diamondback then shuts off the Camera, and cleans her handgun. She then goes up to the roof with a bottle of water to sip, and looks out over the city. "So, Were do you go, to get a lead on the location of a "Former" supervillian?"

The following morning Diamondback got up and stretched. She made a mental note to to talk to the Landlord about the mattress, it needed to be replaced. Since the Alien implants that granted her powers replaced a significant portion of her bone mass, She was careful to not become anemic. Which included having a diet high in iron and protein. Of course there was nothing in the refrigerator she felt safe eating. She was quickly getting the impression that the reason this apartment is "Furnished" is because the previous tenant left in a rush.
Making her way to a dinner, Diamondback ordered breakfast and asked to look at a phone book. If Nero had gone straight, its possible that he listed. She of course looked under his real name, Nicholas Rourke. The woman was more then mildly surprised when she found an address for him in down town Freedom City. She finished eating, and asked for them to fill her thermos with coffee, before taking off. Once more flying over the city on an energy disk as she made her way to pay the man a visit.

The streets around the building, a simple three story house, are crowded with peoples watching the fire, the building is going up like a torch, flames erupting from broken windows and dark smoke rising in the sky.
As diamonback come close, she catches a glimpse of a figure in a white toga sprinting away.

Diamondback curses as she gains altitude to avoid the clotheslines and other things that would slow down her pursuit of robe clad fire starter. She knew it would be harder to maintain line of site on the man, but she had to risk it. Still she poured more energy into the disk, making sure she was going as fast as she could manage in an effort to catch up with him.

Like a bird of Prey, Diamondback swoops down intending to slam the man between the energy disk and the ground. She wasn't going to let him get away.

Diamondback released the energy disk then, and help the old man to his feet. She took a deep breath before continuing. She really wasn't happy about the situation, Sure she'd caught the most likely suspect fleeing the scene, but she wanted to know why.
"I was actually on my way to see you Mr. Rourke." She replied. "I'm currently investigating several fires for the french embassy, and was going to ask you a few questions. I'm afraid I"m now going to have to place you under arrest for suspicion of arson. Do you understand?"
She took out a pair of handcuffs, and cuffed the man with his hands behind his back.

The room itself was small. A one way mirror ornating the wall with a simple table on wich handcuffs can be attached with two simple chairs represented the complete furnishing. In a corner of the ceiling a camera was present the feed of wich was doubtlessly being watched by cops right now.*

Diamondback took her time, Making sure she had everything she needed before going into see Mr. Rourke (She still didn't want to think of him as Nero, despite what she saw). She carried with her a small file folder, as well as a cup of water, with a single ice cube in it. She'd been forced to leave her handgun in a lock box when she entered the police station, but that was alright by her.
"I was hoping our first meeting would have been more social, Mr Rourke." She said placing the cup of water in front of him. She then set up her video camera, with a separate tape then the one she used for her video journal, "Do you mind if I record this interview? Its simply for my records."
(Diplomacy check, to improve his attitude)
"Mr. Nicholas Rourke, At one time you were referred to by the name "Nero" Correct?" She was saying this more to identify the man for the recordings. "I'm known as Diamondback, I'm a special investigator for the French Embassy here in Freedom City.
"My first question, is what were you doing at the Embassy three nights ago?" She asked, taking the picture from her folder of the man leaving the Embassy she'd first been shown when she'd been given the investigation. "And is there any reason you can think of, why an arsonist would be targeting members of the ambassador and his staff?"

"I'm sorry, I must have misspoke. That building wasn't the embassy." Diamondback replied trying to keep her voice soothing. then produced a copy of the original threat letter, and showing it to him. "The picture at the embassy is apparently from you delivering this letter, a few days ago."
Diamondback saw no need to question him about the most recent fire, at least not yet. "Is there anything that happened recently that might have been stressful?"

Nothing Diamonback could do about that
She took just a few minutes to reach Rourkes apartement, a small place in a bad quarter of the city, probably all he could afford, not many peoples are willing to employ an ex supervillain.

Quickly locating the interruptor, diamondback brought light to the appartement, seeing it, she wished she haden't.
The place was a two room kitchen affair, her own new appartement seeming pristine in comparaison.

Diamondback searched the two rooms thoroughly, not an easy job given the state of the place and by the end of it, she was covered in dust and grime. However, her search was not in vain.
Under the Bed of Rourke she found a strange grey device, blinking slowly with green and red lights and a single dial set up on maximum.
Diamondback had no idea what the device was, wich in itself was suspect since it ressembled nothing that a person would stick under his own bed.

Diamondback's initial reaction, is to reduce the power of the device to its minimum setting. Its true she had no idea what it did but she had some suspicions. She didn't touch it with her bare hands however, instead using her energy fields to shield her hands from possibly disturbing fingerprints on it.
Once again, she took out her cell phone and called one of her contacts. This time seeking the contact information of a trustworthy hero with a better understanding of technology then she did.

Later that night, Diamondback meets with her contact and show him her find. His reaction is one of puzzlement at first quickly followed by curiosity. After looking the device over for a few minutes he comes to a conclusion.
This device is used to induce Hypnothic trance in a subject after he got to sleep.

"Thank you." Diamondback replied to the information, passing the man some money, and making sure she had the man's number on her phone, in case she needed a tech person's help once more.
Taking the device, She goes directly to the police station, and turns the device over telling the detective in the case all about the device. Hopefully it would be enough to clear Rouke from arson charges as he was clearly under influence of someone else.
"The next question becomes, Who could build such a device? And what would they have to gain by engineering attacks like this? And have we found a connection between the second fire and the French Embassy?"

*the police officers nods* We found a connection alright, it seems one of the peoples living in the building works at the embassy. but he is no one important, just a guy hired to clean.

"That is grasping at straws, if someone is looking at striking at my country." Diamondback replied, passing in front of the officer for some time.
"I need a name. Who would have access to this level of technology, yet have a grudge against the French?" She asked, first the officer. And then one of her contacts over her cell phone.

The police officer couldn't help her, he is a simple cop and the world of superpowered individuals isn't his, however, her contact allowed her to learn that there is only one group with both the tech and motive to do something like this. SHADOW

SHADOW. You didn't work long in security without learning something about that organization. Diamondback couldn't see what was to be gained by setting fire to the homes of the cleaning crew.
Once more she walked into the room where Rouke waited. She expected there to be two other people with her, the layer and shrink he'd requested earlier. She brought the device with her, Safely turned off this time. "Mr Rouke. I found this device under your bed when searched your apartment. I'm told that it would put one in a hypnotic trance. Its my belief that this is what caused the revival of Nero. Do you recognize it?"

"I've never seen it in my life" Answer Rourke, relief plain on his face when he learn that he wasn't going crazy again.

"Good." Diamondback replied. examining the device for any marks that might help her identify where it came from. "Tell me, have you had any unusual visitor's lately? or any break ins?"

Rourke shakes his head
"I don't know, I wouldn't really be able to tell"
Suddenly, the device start emitting a strange light, turning on by itself, before Diamondback's eyes Rourke seems to relax completely and his hands are being envelloped into flame, the lawyer shrieks and back off against the wall while the shrink tries to wake up Rourke.

Diamondback's response was instant. Energy fields expanded and wrapped around her fist, as she brought it down on device smashing it completely.
"Hello Emperor Nero, What brings you to grace me with your presence?" She didn't want to antagonize this portion of Rouke's personality.

The instant the device is destroyed, Nero start twitching, the flames on his hands flickering as the two sides of his personality battles.
After a few seconds he collapses, unconscious but flame free, when he wake up he looks around confusedly.
"What happened ?"

"We've confirmed the device is the cause." Diamondback replied, sweeping the remains of it into the garbage can, then taking it out of the room with her. "Good day, hopefully we can meet again on more social terms Mr Rouke."
There were still many questions that needed to be answered. But At least she'd been able to help one reformed villain stay reformed. What did Shadow hope to accomplish by attacking the Embassy? As she left the Police station, she returned to the French Consulate to speak with the Ambassador as to what she's found.
