# [Freedom City Stories]Brimstone in the slums : Ricky story

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-18 13:33:39)

Almost there, just a few more hours of flight and Ricky would reach freedom.
The plane he took was perfectly ordinary, everything on it was perfectly normal. Except for one thing. He couldn't be sure who or why but he had felt a presence, and not a nice one.
A demon was on the plane, along with 200 normal passengers. This could get messy.

Ricky leans back in his seat, head turned upward toward the ceiling. He thinks about the skies beyond, and the heavenly realm that is meant to lie even further aboveâ€”though he personally suspects Heaven's geographical relationship with the Earth or indeed with space itself is rather more complex than that.
*No rest even this close,* he thinks, then chastises himself. *No complaining, Ricky, you lost any right to that if you ever had it.*
The youth ponders, tightly crossing his arms and continuing to stare blankly upward. The professional young brunette woman next to him casts him a look, her expression vaguely disapproving. It isn't the first time she has allowed her eyes to stray over his worn and tattered clothing and his somewhat scruffy appearance.
Ricky witnesses this at the very periphery of his own vision, but chooses to ignore it. It's not an unusual reaction to him. What exactly can he do about it? He is kept so busy by his personal crusade, and he only has a small selection of clothes which get more and more damaged by the day. His only cashflow comes from the oddjobs he takes to make ends meet, and the occasional "contribution" from the pockets of slain daemons that he discovers in mortal form.
*What to do? I can't kick up a fuss on the plane, and I can't risk the fight damaging it either. I can wait until we land before taking action, I'm not **that** hell-bent on killing them.*
His lips twitch slightly as he registers the unintentional pun within the internal monologue, prompting another suspicious look from the adjacent passenger.
*Actually,* he realises, humour gone as swiftly as it arose at the forefront of his mind, *if I manage to follow it, it might lead me to a nest. Wouldn't be a bad bit of work for my first day in the city. Best to work out who it is before I leave the plane, though.*
Gripping the headrest of the seat in front for support, Ricky gets to his feet. Thankfully he has the aisle seat, and he doesn't have to bother his unwilling neighbour unnecessarily. Nevertheless he smiles at her. Though his expression is as tired as his appearance, the attractive man Ricky's fate refuses to let him be briefly shines out from underneath and the woman's own expression softens somewhat.
The hunter turns and moves back along the plane toward the toilet, letting his supernatural senses spread outward to touch each and every passenger on his way. If the target is not there, he reasons, then they'll be closer to the front of the plane than his seat and he'll have a chance to pass by them upon landing if he's the first to his feet.
((OOC: Notice +6 to try and pinpoint the origin of the daemon's aura.))

Either the demon is very skilled at hidding himself or he is too far away for ricky to pinpoint him precisely. His aura permeates the whole plane but doesn't allow ricky to track him down.

### **simplyscribed** (2009-07-22 08:36:52)

Defeated by the sheer strength of the infernal being's aura, Ricky enters the toilet so as not to arouse any suspicion. While he's there...
As he answers nature's call, Ricky considers his next move.
*In the end, it comes down to which kind of daemon it is. If they belong to Mastema, they're far more dangerous. But of course, I've never managed to feel the difference between the two.*
Mildly frustrated, he punches the wall of the cubicle. Not at his hardest, but enough to regret it rather than feel any stress relief.
*Well,* he reasons as he examines his knuckles, *I'll be able to follow it better through a big place like the airport, since I'll sense if the aura starts fading and which direction it's heading in. So it's not the end, not yet.*
Ricky returns to his seat. He smiles again to the woman sitting next to him, and she no longer seems quite to disposed against him.
He waits patiently for the plane's arrival at its destinationâ€”and his own arrival at his new destiny.

A few minutes after Ricky sit down, one of the passenger at the other hand of the plane stand up and walks toward the cabin.
One of the flight attendant tries to gently stop him and send him back to his seat.
The man, in all appearance in his early 40s adjust his glasses and the attractive woman blocking his path crumble on the floor.
The passenger noticing this are obviously worried and upset but the man simply walk over the flight attendant and reach for the cabin.

Ricky is on his feet again even as the stewardess begins to collapse. He doesn't know exactly what he's going to do yet, and that worries him. All he knows is that he can't just watch as the daemon hurts people. And whatever business it has in the cockpit, it can't be good.
*But am I even sure that **is** the daemon?* Ricky thinks to himself, suddenly unsure whether a hellfire blast is appropriate against the target. But then, what other weapons does he have?
Finding a compromise with himself, he throws a supernatural blast of roiling orange and black flames at the man's leg, hoping to incapacitate rather than outright kill. Better to not disturb the other passengers by allowing them to see him reverting to true form after death in any case.

THe hellfire blast scorches the plane, the green mystical flame of power wrapping around the passenger.......to no effect at all.
The passenger turn toward you as the plane erupt in panic, the passenger scrambling to get away from you.
The mouth of the passenger distand horribly, it seems certain that it is not in fact human.
The demon rushes toward the cockpit and with a blast of hellfire of his own walks inside it.

'Face me, daemon!' Ricky bellows, rushing down the aisle toward the cockpit with hellfire energy beginning to coalesce around his hands.
He ignores the screams and terrified faces all around him, pushes aside worries about how he's going to get away once the plane lands. The plane has to land, first. And Ricky is rather certain that if the daemons has its way the last "landing" of this flight will be a violent and fatal one. What possible purpose could it have for a hijack, which seems the only real alternative?
As the creature steps through the ruined door to the cockpit beyond, Rickuy throws a second blast at its back.

'Damn it!'
Ricky sighs, the hellfire disappearing from his hands.
*Did I scare it off, or was this all a set up?* he wonders grimly.
*Still, no one was hurt… But from here on out, it gets awkward.*
'Remain calm please,' he calls, continuing forward along the aisle. He stops just short of the cockpit, crouching by the stewardess to check her pulse.
'Are you okay?' he asks the pilots even as he stoops to learn the woman's fate.

The woman is alive but unconscious. Put to sleep trougha form of magic.
The copilots nods wordlessly that he is fine, eyes wide at the display and looking around for what happened.
Meanwhile the passengers are panicked and backed at the end of the plane, afraid of Ricky.
Suddenly the pilot turn around, a malevolent grin on his face and his eyes blood red.
"You are so screwed"
Suddenly the plane take a dive as the pilot aims the plane for the ground.

'As if I'd let these people die this way!' Ricky roars, rushing the pilot while there is still floor beneath his feet and the plane is not yet in a vertical plummet.
'It's up to you,' he yells to the co-pilot, 'right this plane!'
Then he leaps upon the pilot, attempting to subdue him or at the least distract him. He is sensible of the fact this may be some form of possession, though he's never encountered it before, and is reluctant to use lethal force against the man (or is it daemon?) until he knows for sure or has no other choice. So instead he relies first on his somewhat uninspiring human power and punches the pilot clean on the jaw.

Just as Ricky tries to knock a good punch at the pilot, the plane lurches and propel him a few feet away, hitting his head against cockpit's door frame.
The pilot then turn toward the co pilot and talk to him in a demonic voice
"Stop"
To Ricky's surprise, the copilot actually stop trying to right the plane.

'No!' Ricky yells, terror in his voice but also rage, 'How dare you! I will *not* allow it!'
He is pumped full of adrenaline and righteous fury, and this time he doesn't dare to pull his true power. Lives are at stake! Too many lives. Though he is loathe to use hellfire on an innocent victim, if the pilot is truly a possessed human he should survive. The flames of hellfire do not burn as such, and leave mortal flesh intact. They sear the soul instead, imbued as they are with Sin. To a creature not wholly of Eden, to the divine or the profane such as the daemon, it will be that much more painful and unbearable. Just as a human has more to fear from stones, spears, and guns than an otherworldly creature ever could, that same creature naturally has more to fear from otherworldly energy.
Ricky staggers toward his foe, ignoring the sharp pain in his head and using the brief time it takes to make those few steps to gather his energies and focus his will. Still a short distance from the target, he lashes out with a whipping scythe of hellfire, putting everything he has into the attack.
((OOC: Hellfire Scythe +8 (**db** 8, reach 1, vampiric, penetrating, affects insubstantial 2).

The green burning scythe of mystical power slice clean trough the body of the pilot.
WIth a inhuman cry the the pilot collapse against his chair, visibly shacken and in pain as the mystic flames course trough his body, causing great pain to the demon possessing him.
As soon as the energy blade hit the pilot, the young copilot snap out of his trance and immediatly start righting the plane again.
All would be well but out of the pilot mouth, a great billowing shawdow escapes, twisting and slithering until the demon reappears less than a meter from ricky stunned by his attack.
((Well, that went well, the demon got a staggered and stunned result))

Never one to let go of an advantage when he has one, Ricky performs a half-turn and strikes again, his hellfire scythe leaving a trail of co-mingling void and light in the air on its way to impact with the daemon anew. There will be no punches pulled this time, and the daemon is without the shield of human flesh. The hellfire will be lethal.
((OOC: Hellfire Scythe +8 (db 8, reach 1, vampiric, penetrating, affects insubstantial 2)
PS. Is there some sort of rule that specifies supernatural energy has to be green? Only I described hellfire as "roiling orange and black flames" in my first post. ;p))

The flame scythe slash trough the air and impales the demon, however the wounds is shallow, drop of black ichors bleed from the creature shoulders as it hisses at Ricky.
It then extend his arm toward the cockpit and fire a blast of hellfire at the glass windows, luckily the glass is quite strong but still get dangerously cracked, it wouldn't take much more to destroy it completely.
((Demon take a bruised + injured conditions, is not stunned anymore so he is bruised 1, injured 1, staggered and the window of the cockpit is injured. And I blame spawn for my tendency to make magical hellish energy green :P))

'Infernal filth!,' Ricky roars, eyes flashing in the grim light of his hellfire.
He appraises the situation quickly - unstable glass in the cockpit, innocent bystanders back in the cabin. The daemon only partially injured, prepared to do its worst before it dies.
It must *not* be allowed to. Beyond defeating it, he perceives no other real options.
Boiling over with fury, Ricky brings his scythe back around, the seconds seeming to stretch out as he he focuses his wrathful gaze on his target and determines the best approach for his assault. The hellfire weapon seems to grow and burn hotter. Then he swings not once but twice. The blows must be decisive, so he pulls out all the stops and puts all of his effort into making them so.
((OOC:

I'm not sure if there is an applicable power feat that could improve my damage bonus - I wasn't able to find one in the core book. If there is I may want to change my action. Hopefully the two attacks will be enough to knock the damned thing down the track a few steps anyway.))

The scythe twirls in the air and slams into the demon twice, the first blow as little effect but the second leaves a gash on the creatures chest, who howls in pain and stumble back against the cockpit wall, visibly stunned.
((Didn't had to use the HP since you rolled high enough to hit both time, so I'd advise using it to avoid suffering from fatigue.

'Stronger than the usual fiendspawn your master sends after me, aren't you?' Ricky says through gritted teeth.
'But even you must be feeling despair', he continues, 'agony to feel the full weight of your Sin, isn't it? You've already lost. You lost the moment you Fell, and this is just a footnote.'
He smiles grimly, gazing upon his wretched foe with contempt burning in his eyes. Then he thrusts his hand forward, his hellfire weapon spearing the daemon in the chest.

Ricky kicks the body to make sure it is truly dead, then turns away in disgust. The hellfire disappears from his limbs, and he hangs his head.
*All this. Is it my fault?*
Remembering the stewardess the daemon had attacked earlier, Ricky steps out of the cockpit and kneels by her to check her pulse.
'Please, be alive...' he murmurs through gritted teeth.

'Is there a doctor on the plane?' Ricky calls, looking up and scanning the worried faces along the length of the vehicle.
'This woman needs to be looked after and I have no idea how to do it. Please?'
He sighs, sensing only terror as they look on with clear reluctance to speak with him.
'The trouble is over now. I promise I won't hurt you. It was never me that wanted to hurt you. It was the man I attacked, and he's been stopped.'
Without waiting to see the effect of his words, he returns to the cockpit.
'Please, reassure the passengers,' he asks the two pilots, 'they're still very afraid. I'm sure you are too, but you have to trust me that it's over now. We're safe.'
Ricky leans on the door frame, crossing his arms and marshalling his thoughts. The two men seem just as scared as the passengers, though they've at least kept their nerve and kept the plane upright.
'I'm not going to lie to you two, because you know what you've seen and experienced. You'll want to doubt it, you might even hate me for confirming it, but it's better that you know now. You'll never forget it, no matter how much you try and push it down, and it *will* haunt you, so it's healthier for you to at least accept it so you can move on. Like I had to.
'Here it is: that was a daemon. And I'm a daemon hunter. The beast wanted this plane to crash, but now it's dead and it's over. It's probably better that the passengers don't know though, you should tell them it was a terrorist attack or something.
'I don't mean to be a pain,' he continues with a wry smile, 'but I'd appreciate it if you could paint a picture of my role in this too. They're terrified of me and my powers, and we can't change that, but the remainder of my journey would be a lot less awkward if they thought I was the good guy. Tell them I stopped the terrorist. Actually, it's only a very small tweaking of the truth.'

He steels himself against the cold sucking vacuum that the cabin has become, privately amazed that even he is managing to withstand it, and continues to resolutely lower the plane.

*Crap, what now?*
Ricky tenses, lamenting his troubled life in his mind. Then he realises: help has arrived, in the form of one of those superheroes that are always on the news. He recalls that they're common in the Freedom City area.
*That settles it*, he thinks, *I really have to get away as soon as this plane lands. The last thing I need is some superstrong flying jock asking me questions.*
He stands and makes his way back through the plane, ignoring the eyes on him. *Mostly suspicious and fearful still*, he notes, *I guess I'm not glamorous enough to be put on a pedestal like a superstrong flying jock*.
'Don't worry,' he says to the woman in the seat next to his upon arrival, 'I'm just getting my things.'
She looks confused , probably unable to decide how she should react to Ricky. Her two conflicting preconceptions from earlier in the flight war in her mind no doubt, trying to decide how what she has seen Ricky do (and what she has been told he did) factor in.
Ricky smiles weakly. *Poor woman probably has no idea what to think. Still, I've given her a great story to tell her friends and co-workers. She'll be the centre of attention for months.*
He pulls his bag out from under the seat in front. Everything of value he owns is in the bag, which is convenient since he is now planning to abandon his suitcase and get away from the airport as quickly as possible.
Taking the bag in hand he returns to the cockpit, wanting to keep up to speed with events and reasoning he'll get off the plane fastest if he's already at the front.
Sitting down to rest against the wall again, he waits with closed eyes for the superheroic assistant outside to set the plane down.

Ricky mentally admits defeat. It had been foolish of him, he realises now, to ever think he could so easily escape the inevitable entanglements of this encounter's aftermath.
He is no doubt tough enough thanks to his supernatural enhancements to survive a jump from the plane, but with Captain Thunder hovering in the nearest exit and able to *fly*, he doubts he'd get very far.
Ricky sighs, and hopes the superhero is a reasonable man who will let him go quickly following his explanations.

Ricky disembarks and waits as patiently as possible for a man who doesn't want to be there. He suspects that if he'd absconded he might genuinely have been let go, but there is also the very real possibility of this hero or one of his friends then tracing him and keeping tabs.
*Of course, that might happen anyway now*, he reflects.
When Captain Thunder finally approaches him, Ricky cannot resist allowiing his extrasensory abilities free reign. Is the hero really as Good as his public image suggests. Or, like most humans, is there a little Evil in him?
Actually, what if the man suspects Ricky of being a guilty party? Might be best to see whether he can detect any danger too.
((OOC: Trying to use Ricky's super-senses to detectic evil/good, as well as potential danger. And danger-sense too, while I'm at it.))

*Lucky him*, Ricky thinks when he senses Captain Thunder's innate goodness. *Some of us aren't so clean…*
He nods in silent approval when the hero manages to prevent drawing media attention to Ricky. The consideration of his wishes is welcome.
'I'm not sure what foes you're used to dealing with in your line of work, Captain Thunder, but you're immersed in a very unusual world so it may come as little suprise to you when I say what I am about to say. Or if you're not a religious man you may think me mad, and I wouldn't blame you.'
Pausing for breath, Ricky looks away toward the plane. His eyes narrow slightly as he considers how much he really needs to say.
'Daemons exist. At least two types of them, actually. There are those who followed Lucifer to Hell, and there are those who dwell with Mastema among mortalkind. If you're a student of scriptures you might think that "Lucifer" and "Mastema" are both just other names for "Satan". I assure you, the two entities are seperate. Considered together though, perhaps they are very much Satan, the antithesis of God.'
'It is Lucifer's role to rule Hell and he is charged with responsibility over the souls of sinners. Sometimes his daemons seek to corrupt mortal souls to bolster their power. Mastema's task is a different one. He and his followers live on Earth, and are tasked to test the morality of mortals. They are not meant to create corruption where there was none before, but if there is even a shred of doubt in an otherwise devout heart, they will pounce on that opportunity and destroy lives. I am truly not sure which of the two types I encountered on the plane today, but I suspect it was a Luciferan daemon trying to bring a prized soul more quickly to Hell by causing it to crash.'
*But it may equally have been a Masteman daemon going after **my** soul*, his mind supplies. He declines to put the thought to words.
'Some years ago I was visited by the Archangel Michael and given powers to detect and fight daemonkind. To this day I haven't worked out why it was me. Perhaps it was a test all along. If it was, I've made a bit of a mess of it. I'm not as good a man as I perhaps should be, Captain, and I've made mistakes that may not be redeemable. But I still would like to think I'm on the same side as you, for all that I've become dirtied. That is why I hunt daemons and try to save souls. Perhaps it's a fitting responsibility for someone whose own soul has become lost.'
Ricky realises he has strayed from the point, perhaps too much. He smiles blandly and shrugs.
'That's about it. Just another terrorist attack except this time the terrorist was a supernatural one. If there's nothing else I would really like to be anywhere but here very fast. You might be able to imagine that a story like mine may be unbelievable to any government officials that get a chance to question me. I'd like to avoid an unhappy misunderstanding.'
Turning to walk away, Ricky has a thought and pauses midstride.
'I suppose there are lots of souls gone astray in a city like this one Captain?' he asks over his shoulder, 'to need so many "superheroes", after all...'
'Well, it looks like I may be stuck here for a little while. If you have a reason to suspect daemonic activity and think that I could help, I'm sure you'll be able to find me. Start in districts with low rent.'
He begins to walk away again (unless stopped), seeking to quickly leave the airport premises and get a taxi into the city proper.

*Captain thunder Stop Ricky as he starts to walk away, the man looks him up and down and then hands him a card with an adress.*
I can't really judge your story, I've fought many creatures over the years but Demons aren't my speciality.
However if you go to that adress you'll meet someone who will probably be very interested in your story. If you don't go, I'll have no choice but to consider that you've been lying to me, and you don't want to have the Freedom league after you.
*The captain smilled pleasently*
Don't take this the wrong way, this isn't a threat, I don't want to take any risks if peoples in freedom are in danger.

## Re: Brimstone in the slums : Ricky story

### **simplyscribed** (2009-10-26 11:34:30)

Ricky takes the card, a grim expression marring his features. When the Captain smiles at him and says his last piece, Ricky breaks into a lopsided grin—possibly the first true smile he's worn in a long time.
'Lying doesn't suit you Captain. If the potential enmity of an entire league of monstrously powered, larger than life figures in colourful costumes isn't a threat, I'm sure I don't know what else could qualify!'
'I'll go,' he adds in a genial tone, looking downward to read the address on the card, 'since I have very little else to do in any case. Who knows, it may even be a refreshing change to make the acquaintance of someone else in a similar field. It's been a pleasure to meet you, Captain. Oh, should we ever meet again, you can call me Ricky. I'm afraid I don't have an exciting codename: its never come up before.'
He turns again, and this time really does take his leave.
Before leaving the airport, Ricky finds a duty-free store in which he can purchase some clothes. He has only just realised that his earlier exertion caused him to sweat and the experience in the cockpit froze the sweat. He takes the clothes to the lavatory, where he gives himself as good a wash as he can manage and changes in the cubicle.
Feeling somewhat cleaner and a great deal less uncomfortable, Ricky moves as surreptitiously as possible through the airport to the taxi rank outside. He gives the nearest driver the address card given to him by Captain Thunder.
*No time like the present*, he thinks.

The taxi drops Ricky at 110 Ditko street in the riverside area of town.
The ride allowed him to observe part of Freedom, has he rode on Road 4 toward Riverside, Ricky could see the rich houses of Bayview on his right, and on his left the more middle state of the Southside.
Riverside itself has a distinct bohemian feels, throngs of students walking, riding on bikes or skateboards, all of them wearing clothes as different from one another as the mass of humanity are similar. Artists walk alongside shop owners, trees border the road and the house in front of which the cab drop him as a quaint Victorian style.

Ricky watches the carefree students with a twinge of jealousy. He himself had been unable to attend college. He had learned what he knew from the school of hard knocks and the night course of necessity.
As for the houses... Ricky chuckles. He supposes he could afford rent on such a place for a little while, but where he'd get the money to continue doing so from he can't imagine. No, it seems he'll be living poorly again in Freedom.
He thanks and pays the taxi driver and waits for the can to pull away before approaching the victorian-styled house. He looks for a bell button or pull to alert the homeowner to his presence. Failing that he knocks out a sharp tattoo on the wood.

## Re: Brimstone in the slums : Ricky story

### **simplyscribed** (2009-10-29 11:26:13)

Hesitating for a moment, Ricky wonders how much he should say. Is this man the one he's meant to speak to? In any case, how wise would it be to reveal the story while standing atop the porch?
'Ah... I'm sorry to disturb you,' he begins, eloquently enough but for the first small faltering, 'but I was sent to this address by a person who wanted the resident here to listen to my story. I think the Captain thought he wasn't equipped to judge the case with his own abilities, and he seemed to think he was sending me to speak to someone with a better understanding of the *unusual* field I work in. In any case, he was insistent that I come.'
'Am I speaking to the homeowner?' he adds after a thought, inwardly berating himself for not having asked such a logical question at the very outset.

*The old man bend over and set aside to let Ricky walk in*

He then leads ricky inside the house. Everywhere the same quaint victorian style can be found, but things are very far from normal. From the corner of his eyes Ricky catches movement, but when he turns around all he can see are portraits hangings on the wall, somehow they looked slightly different each time he looked, as if the occupants moved.
His suspicions are quickly confirmed when he see a teacup floating in the air coming froma salon and going toward the kitchen
Very soon however, Ricky and the egyptian reaches a library containing hundreds, if not thousands of tomes, in it a man is sitting in a comfortable looking chair, his main distinctive trait being a a frange of white on his otherwise Raven hair. He nods at Ricky.*

'Sure,' Ricky agrees, looking around at the multitude of books lined up on every wall with obvious interest.
'Though I'm not sure how you're going to ascertain the truth. Some sort of magic reading I suppose? This is without doubt going to rank among the most interesting and exhausting days I've ever experienced.'
'You have me at a disadvantage, however. You appear to know my name and why I'm here. I on the other hand know nothing. I'll tell my story in any case, but could you inform me to whom I'm speaking?'

'Yes,' Ricky agrees, 'it would. I've never been in a position to network before but I'd probably have an easier time of it if I weren't out in the cold.'
He smiles mirthlessly, lips going thin.
'I've always thought of my duty as a burden I have to carry alone, that I shouldn't involve anyone else. That's probably still true. I doubt it would hurt to have the support of others who are already part of the world I live in though.'
His smile becomes genuine at the thought.
'Well, Mr Eldritch, I'll take you up on the offer. So what happens now?'

Now ? Well you have to find out why this demon was on this plane, it may have escaped your notice but from what you said the creature was singularly bent on bringing the plane down, he could have fought you, he could have escaped but he chose to stay and try to bring down the plane, even at the cost of his life.
I find this comportement peculiar for a demon, don't you ?

---

## Re: Brimstone in the slums : Ricky story

### **simplyscribed** (2009-11-02 08:04:09)

'Actually, I have some ideas about that,' Ricky confesses.
'The world is bigger and crazier than I ever thought it was, so it's possible the daemon is of a kind unknown to me, but it's also possible it belongs to one of the two groups I know and fight. If that is true, there is a way to explain its behaviour in either case.'
'If it was a Luciferan daemon, the likely answer is that it wanted to kill one of the passengers and bring a particularly prized soul more quickly to Hell. It probably wouldn't be mine... Lucifer seems to find me entertaining. Yet if it was a Masteman daemon... then it probably was there to kill me and me alone. Unfortunately, unless its an ability I've not yet realised I have, I can't identify daemons, I can only detect their presence, so short of finding out whether anyone else on the plane has an exceedingly corrupt soul I'm not sure how I'd investigate matters.'

Of course you could always try to find another demon and interrogate it or simply do some research on the peoples of the plane. That would take an humongous amount of time for something that may not produce any results of course.
Whatever you decide to do it would seems that your first concern should be to find a place to stay.

Curious, and frankly worried, by the strange aura engulfing him as he stands at the entrance in the alley, Ricky decides that it is his duty to investigate. Trying to move without sound, he slowly walks further into the alley in search of the daemon, alert to any potential dangers.

As ricky ventures deeper in the alley, the presence becomes clearer, scarier, the aura of demonic power coming from it has been wrapped and twisted upon itself.
Suddenly, the demon is in front of him, not even trying to hide or masks his appearance.
The thing is 7 feet tall, horned and possessing black leather wings, fairly common for a demon, what is less than common is metalic arm replacing one of the original and the fact that half the demon skull has been replaced by a metalic attachement.

Ricky is shocked. He had encountered nothing like this ever before. *Daemons surely don't make use of robotics!*
*But then, these are human modifications?*
Rather than destroy the daemon immediately, Ricky decides that it might be best to wait and see if he can get any clues about who or what modified it. They may very well be more dangerous in the long run than their peculiar Frankenstein's Hellspawn.

He hurls a bolt of the diabolical energy at his foe while tensing, ready to dodge the beast's powerful charge.

Ricky could use this opportunity to threaten the daemon in hope of more information, but he knows his opponent as well as they claim to know him. Daemons don't go for that kind of thing - whatever else, they're not cowards. They don't know how to be.
He also strongly suspects that giving the creature an opening would be a colossal mistake, as it no doubt is not as stunned as all that.
So instead, he takes the opportunity to put more distance between him and the beast while firing another hellfire blast at his downed foe.

The bolt of energy slams into the demon's back, eliciting a groan but doing very little damage in and off itself. Th demon stand and seeing that Ricky has the advantage of being able to move back and attack from a distance looks at him hatefully.

'Idiot creature,' Ricky mutters to himself, looking at the dark energy sheathing his forelimbs, 'winning every fight isn't the same as *winning*.'
He allows the hellfire to dissipate and leaves the alley. It is even more important to find a place to stay now. Ricky has never visited Freedom City before, assuming that the superhero-ridden metropolis would be well-enough defended against daemonkind. He sees now he was wrong in the assumption. What help he can offer to the colourfully costumed crowd should be offered. Will be offered.
And so, while musing over what manner of daemon he just faced, Ricky returns to his housing search.
