# [Freedom City Stories] Lost lore of Eldritch : Garrif story

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-18 13:37:14)

Summer was fast approaching, and with it, the promise of great heat and danger, the potents had been there for anyone to see. A letter written on simple paper had come to the rectory some hours earlier,at dawn, it's content relativly banal, inviting garrif to meet the sender near St stephen's church in lantern hill.
The missive itself had a few odd details, for once, it was written in an old fashioned way, rarely used by anyone these days but quite prevalent during the 30's. But more importantly, the mark at the bottom of the letter was easy to recognise, the mark of the master mage, Adrian Eldritch.
Everyone know who Adrian Eldritch is, at least anyone with a inkling of magical knowledge does, an invitation from his part could be equaly dangerous and rewarding but always a rare thing.
The question now plaguing Garrif was simple, answer the master mage summon, or carry on his research for his demonic father alone.

Garrif sat in the library of the Rectory, reading up on the history of the demons and their various wars, looking for weaknesses in the Ragetear, but not really finding any, when one of the golem servants brought him a letter that had been left by the door. Taking the letter and opening it, Garrif was immediately aware of the writing style. An invitation to Lantern Hill, by Eldritch himself, no less.
Garrif quietly contemplated this turn of events. He knew that the master mage was not someone to lightly dismiss. Besides, Garrif had been hunting the Ragetear for centuries now, with little to no success. Maybe Eldritch would have some new information about his demonic father.
Sending the Golems to fetch his things, Garrif put on his travel cloak and locked the front door from the inside. Then, standing in the foyer, Garrif moved his hands in a pattern which, to the untrained eye, might look like a dance or a mental disability, but in actuality helped in the manipulation of the energies that permeate the entirety of reality. Words were uttered to help with the spell.
"By the mists of Mordo, by the power of Baralk, bridge the distance, and let me walk."
At the uttering of the last words, a round portal appeared in mid air in front of Garrif. It might have looked like a television set, since around the edges were still the Rectory, but inside the circle was a hill in another spot of Freedom City. The hill was Lantern Hill. Stepping through the portal, Garrif was instantly transported to the hill. Waving a hand behind himself, the portal shrunk down and disappeared.
Walking up towards St. Stephen's church, Garrif was reminded that he still needed to write this Sunday's sermon for his own church. He had to keep up pretenses, after all. And, being a clergyman allowed so much freedom in movement and asking questions later on. He had no problems allowing everyone to think that the miracles he himself produced were the acts of a divine being. He kind of enjoyed the notion for a while, until he'd glance in a mirror and see that he was far from divine in nature.
Still, work to be done. A master mage to meet. He needed to know why he'd been summoned. He knew that he was a powerful mage, but that Eldritch was more so.
As he walked along, his demonic sight helped him to track down the mage by simply tracking the magic.

Using his demonic sight, garrif's gaze is drawn along toward a side street toward a very thin line of magical energy, however the whole area is bathed in a supernatural glow making it hard to gauge the strength of the aura, it could be the master mage, or it could be a dabler with a modicum of gift to his calling.

Following the lead he could, Garrif heads down the side street. However, he kept his wits about him. He had no intention of being caught unawares.

Walking trough the alley, garrif soon come face to face with a man of medium build and long red hair in a long nondescript coat. The man is leaning against a wall, smoking.
As soon as he spot garrif he turn toward him and reaches into his coat.

As soon as Garrif spotted the long-haired man in the coat, he instinctively began to listen to the man's surface thoughts. He needed to know who he was dealing with and what was going on.
Stopping in his stride, he looked the man up and down for a moment and said, "Hello."

The man, walks towards garrif, taking a letter out of his coat pocket and hands it over to him.
Despite his best efforts, garrif doesn't manage to hear the thoughts of the stranger but his guts tell him that the man can be trusted.
"I'm Rimmer, eldritch couldn't make it. He's got trouble with malador again so he sent me to give you this letter."
After handing over the letter, Rimmer steps back toward the alley, clearly intending to leave.

Trusting his gut, Garrif took the letter from Rimmer and looked it over a second.
*Malador, huh? Well, he should be done in an hour or so.*
Looking back at Rimmer as he walked away, Garrif turned to the side and opened the letter to read it.
(By the way, is this Thomas Rhymer? From Book of Magic?)

The letter read as follow :
Garrif,
I regret that I can't be present to our meeting. My duties as master mage come first and I'm sure you understand.
Nevertheless, I managed to secure some informations that could prove useful in your search.
However, the documents in questions have been stolen from my care. I do not know who the responsible is but the magic used hold traces of powers from the Loa.
You should consider tracking the criminal down, I'm sure finding someone with ties to the Loa and researching demonic powers should not prove to difficult a task.
Eldritch

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-20 17:02:39)

Garrif raised an eyebrow at the Master Mage's letter.
*Information? Possibly about the Ragetear. This will indeed require some investigation.*
Turning back down the alley, Garrif made a few mystical gestures and uttered the same phrase as before;
"By the mists of Mordo,
By the power of Baralk,
Bridge the distance,
And let me walk."
As he finished the spell, a circle of energy appeared before him. Without breaking in stride, Garrif walked through the portal and stepped across the distances, stepping out into the foyer of the Rectory. Waving the portal closed behind himself, Garrif handed off his travel cloak to one of the golems, who immediately took it to hang it elsewhere. Walking down various halls and staircases, Garrif came to his library, on the second floor and towards the center of the Rectory. There, he spent several hours looking through his various tomes and scrolls.
*Loa, loa, where did I put that scroll on contacting the loa? I swear that one day I'm going to organize this place.*
Finally, after seven hours of search, he found it. Taking a quick look at the scroll to confirm what he thought he'd need for the spell, he sent on of the golems down into the kitchen to fetch a chicken and another to fetch a dog from the kennel. Taking a few minutes to draw the appropriate circles and symbols on the floor and wall, Garrif slit the chicken's neck and splattered some of the blood on the wall, and said the words, over and over again;
"By the blood, by the rites, grant me parley with [Papa Legaba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papa_Legba "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papa_Legba")."
As Garrif waited, the circle on the floor and the one on the wall began to glow. The entire ritual took some twenty minutes. As it began to work, Garrif saw the circle change into a hole in the wall, a hole in the world, though which was the home of the loa. Seeing an old man with a straw hat, Garrif smiled and nodded in deference.
"Papa Legaba. You're looking as magnificent as always. How are Loko and Ayizan?"
(I have more to say but don't know how you wanted to handle the formalities. I also assume the ritual worked as I'm using the **Communication** power; Rank 1 with the Dimensional Feat. This makes it worth 2 PP, meaning it took 8 hours of research and 20 minutes of casting to work. Also, since the checks were each of a DC 12 (10+PP cost), I just assumed that Garrif's +18 with taking 10 should do it. Let me know if I did wrong.)

"Garrif child, the Loa knows all, you are in search of informations aren't you ?"

"What is it that you wish ?"

Garrif smiled at the elderly spirit. He had met many spirits in his years upon the Earth. Papa Legaba had always been one of the nicer ones.
"As always, Papa Legaba, I'm looking for information on my father, the Ragetear. Eldritch recently wrote me telling me that he had some new information, but it was stolen from him. His initial investigation led him to believe that one of the Loa had stolen it. Is there anyone you can think of who would want to steal from Eldritch? Or perhaps anyone who was looking for information on the Ragetear? I'd hate to think that any of the Loa would want to contact the Demon General."

The old spirit inhaled more smoke from his pipe
"What does power do ? Mortal knows it, it is an old saying. Demonic power would do that even more efficiently. Find wich Loa has this at heart and you will have your answer"
The old man cracked a smile, enjoying the little mind game with Garrif

Garrif smiles at the old man, knowing that this was simply the way he spoke.
"Ah, Papa Legaba, true it be that mortal does know what power does. At least a few do. And we the Immortal know it too. Power corrupts. Demonic power is indeed much more efficient at it. This I would know better than most. It is the reason I work without magic for some time among the humans. I hope it helps me stay grounded and not aloof. Keeps me humble."
Turning his head a bit and smiling at the old man, Garrif continues. "So, would we be talking about your cousin Samedi? Would he be one to seek after that which corrupts?"

Garrif smiled and nodded his head.
"That much is enough to start, Papa Legaba. I thank you for your generosity with information. By the way, I noticed that you don't have one of your faithful companions with you."
Snapping his fingers at the clay golem standing at one side, Garrif motioned for the golem to bring him the dog he'd sent for earlier. Taking the animal into his hands he placed the animal on the floor in the circle of mystical symbols he'd been standing in.
"May I present this fine canine as a token of my appreciation for your help in this matter?"
Waving his farewell to the Loa, Garrif stepped out of the circle and waited for Legaba to take the dog before he closed the circle. Walking towards the golem, he motioned for his travel robes again before walking back towards the foyer of the Rectory.
"By the mists of Mordo,
By the power of Baralk,
Bridge the distance,
And let me walk."
As the portal appeared in front of him, Garrif stepped through and into a back alley in Freedom City proper. As he closed the portal behind him, he made a small motion with his hands and uttered other words.
"The light bends,
The gazes waver.
Let those who see me,
Not perceive my nature."
The air surrounding Garrif whirled around him for a second and suddenly, anyone who might look at him wouldn't see a man with glowing red eyes and various robes, but a young man with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing normal street kid clothes.
Confident in his disguise (which wouldn't fool a camera, but that was rarely a problem), he walked out onto the street and began to pund the pavement. He needed to find Kalsh, a dwarven purveyor of mystical objects (mostly cheap trinkets to milk money from the normal people). Kalsh always had his ear to the ground and always knew something important. Maybe he would know something about Samedi.
Garrif turned towards downtown and headed for Kalsh's shop.

Garrif manages to reach the shop easily, the city quiet in the late afternoon.
Upon entering the shop, Garrif is welcomed by the sight of dozen of trinkets, potions, herbs and books covering every wall. Of course, Garrif knew that none of it was the real deal. That part of the shop is only for the credule tourist.
*What in the blaze do ya want ?"
The voice of the obnoxious and bad tempered dwarf greets Garrif.

(Take your pick with dwarven attributes, but I like the idea of a cranky dwarf. ;D )
Walking into the store, Garrif smiled as he heard Kalsh's voice. He remembered the various times that he and Kalsh had gotten into arguments over theology, philosophy, and drinking.
The little man could drink a mountain giant under the table. Garrif had seen him do it.
Walking through the store, Garrif found the dwarf and smiled.
"Kalsh, old friend. How are you?"
As Kalsh turned to face the blond headed, blue eyed teenager in front of him, Garrif waved a hand in front of the dwarf's eyes, allowing the dwarf to see him in his true nature.

Garrif smiled down at his old friend's tirade. Understandable, of course. No one liked to be surprised like that.
"Sorry about the subterfuge, Kalsh, but you know I don't like to scare the *normal* people as I walk around. Their limited understanding of the universe around them leaves them rather vulnerable to mental disorders if they're exposed to too much at once. However, aside from that, I'm glad to see that you haven't lost one bit of the spark of that vicious nature of yours.

"The Fens, hmmm. Sad to think about how those people feel the need to resort to drugs to get away from their lives."
Hearing Kalsh's comments on buying something, Garrif smiles.
"Ever the salesman, eh? Well, I am a little short on a few supplies. Have you got any wolf's bane or a bezoar?"
After making his purchases, Garrif thanks Kalsh and teleports back to the Rectory to drop off his supplies before teleporting towards the Fens. Stepping out of the portal in an alleyway, Garrif quickly recast his Glamour so that no one would see him. This time, he chose a slightly less-well kept look. Greasy, ratted black hair. Sunken, yellow eyes. Garrif then went about the streets with a slight hunch, all the while, trying to keep an eye out for the typical drug dealers that ran the area. He needed to find Samedi. The best method for that was to find his dealers, and *convince* them to tell him where their supplier was.

After two hours of search, garrif comes up empty, he found dealers applenty, they weren't hard to track down once the promise of money had been made, but not one of them was willing to reveal his source.
They were afraid of garrif being either a cop or too afraid of whoever supply them to answer his question.

Realizing that the dealers were rather unwilling to give away the location of their supplier, Garrif headed back to one of the dealers again. Walking towards the dealer, the Glamour's greasy hair swinging with each step, Garrif walks up and looks the dealer in the eye. As the dealer most likely turns in disgust towards the strung out looking person approaching him, Garrif allows the Glamour to falter in one respect. He allows his blood-red eyes to show.
"Here's how this is going to go down, little man. You're going to tell me where your supplier is. You're going to tell me everything you know about his back up that might be with him. After that, you're going to go to church and repent of your sins. Because, otherwise, when the day comes that you die, it might be me who comes to collect you and take you home to Hell. Understood?"
As he said the words, he wasn't sure whether it would scare the dealer into revealing the information, or just scare him into running away. Either way, Garrif hoped the dealer would think about it. That would be enough.

Garrif looks around to see if the drug dealer had dropped any of his supply, not wanting it to be left laying around for others to find and hurt themselves with. He takes what he finds, intent on studying it's effects later. Stepping further into the alley, Garrif dispels the Glamour and summons another teleportation portal to Lantern Hill.
*Twice in one day. Let's see where this leads me next.*

After collected a few different small plastic bag containing various powders from the ground, Garrif steps trough the portal and emerge in lantern hill once more.
The adress that he obtained is easily located, after just a few minutes of walking garrif find himself in front of a typical house of this part of town, and old victorian style construct dating from the late 1870s.
However, unlike most of the house on lantern hill, this one is rotten and uncared for, shutters clanking in the wind.
All his dark inside, no light shine trough the window but Garrif senses pick up something cold, disturbing, ancient. AN sensation not unlike the breath of air from an unopened crypt, a vicied stanch.

Garrif wrinkles his nose at the stench coming from the rotted house.
*No doubt someone with a liking of tombs would stay here. Perhaps Samedi?*
Walking into the room, Garrif keeps his eyes open, as his demon heritage makes the dark as though it were broad daylight to him. After stepping through the door, Garrif stops, more out of a courtesy than anything else, and reaches out with his mind for as far as he can, trying to get a sense of the the thoughts of anyone in the building. At the same time, he decides the courtesy should be further used.

A great sense of hunger permeates the mind of garriff as he listen for thoughts and behind him the door quickly lock and latches. From the other rooms of the house, garriff can hear moaning sounds and before long he spots a dozen zombies shuffling toward him.

Sensing as well as seeing the zombie hordes moving towards him, Garrif sighs, his head drooping in dissatisfaction. His hands begin to move in an intricate pattern, weaving back and forth as the words flow from his mouth.
"By the Mists of Mordo,
By the Powers of Tyr,
Let the circle expand.
Protect me here."
A line of archaic symbols appeared in a circle at Garrif's feet. He had no intention of fighting beings who might very well be saved. He thought on what he remembered from his studies of the various methods for creating zombies. He looked over the zombies in the room as well as skimmed their thoughts, trying to determine what manner of zombies these were. Were they long dead, recently dead, or drug-induced zombies? Could they be saved still, or did Garrif simply need to fry them?
As he thought, he raised his voice again,
"Baron Samedi, I did not come here seeking battle with either you or your hordes. I came seeking information. Can we not work this out peaceably?"

The zombies are dead, recently dead but dead non the less.
As Garrif ponders the situation the zombies surrounds him, five on them attacking him at the same time backing him against the door. Their stench is nearly unbearable and their grotesque moans and shreds clothes adds to their disgusting appearance.
However, their slow moves are easily predicted and avoided by Garriff.

Garrif's head flinches back from the stench rolling off of the zombies.
"Whew! Definitely dead. **Samedi!** You're not leaving me good choices here! I'm going to have to kill some of your zombies!"
Realizing that the zombies had completely surrounded him, he knew that he had limited options. His normal Eldritch Blasts would be fairly slow, so he instead thought back for a second and remembered a passage in the Grimmoir that spoke about pulling more power from the aether, but that it was much more difficult to control. This spell would cause an explosive cone, most likely, possibly damaging the building, but it would probably take out most of the zombies in one fell swoop.
His hands made a quick flourish, and the circle of glowing arcane letters surrounding Garrif's feet disappeared, thus ending the Circle of Protection. More motions followed, and a short phrase sprung from Garrif's lips. The only difference between the spell Garrif wove and the normal spell for blasts was in the hands. Instead of holding his hands out, directed at his target, his hands stayed centered on his body, creating the explosive cone right next to himself, and aiming it at the largest cluster of zombies.

Nine out of the dozen zombies crumble on the floor, broken and unmoving. Three however were on the side of the room, avoiding the blast and move toward Garrif and attack again. Garrif manages to avoid the first one but get hit on the head by the second while the third manages to grip him and hold him firmly in place.
((That doesn't look good, you get a stunned and bruised condition and the second zombie manages to pin you down, since you're stuck with reaction for a round I think it's a good time for a little show))
THe second zombie quickly join the third in pining Garrif down with the first moaning at him but doing nothing.
Just a few seconds afterwards a figure in a Tall hat, a ragged coat whitout arms and face painted as a skull emerges from the shadows, twirling a cane.
Baron Samedi looks at Garrif with a smirk and make him lift his head by pushing his chin upward with a finger.
"Now now, what have we here ? A demon child coming in my house and destroying my servants. I have to wonder why it came ?"

Garrif felt a quick jolt of jubilation as the mystical blast took out quite a few zombies. That jolt was quickly expired, however, as the other three managed to pin him down and hold. As Garrif struggled rather uselessly, he looked up at the sound of footsteps approaching. Seeing the gaunt figure dressed to the nines (sort of), Garrif sighed and stopped struggling. Looking up at the monocle wearing figure, Garrif tried to smile diplomatically.
"Baron Samedi. So nice to see you. As to regarding your *servants*, I would like to point out that I did ask for an audience when I arrived. It was your servants who attacked me first. I was merely acting in self-defense. As to the purpose of my visit, I have come to have a talk with you. It has come to my attention that you might be possession of some information about the Ragetear, the Demon General of the Armies of Chaos. I've come to ask you to give me that information. Please."

Garrif, still held down by the zombies, smiled up at the Loa. Of course, he realized that he wasn't that diplomatic. It just wasn't how he dealt with people, so instead, he played to his strengths.
"Ok, Samedi. If that's how the game'll be played today, then so be it. What do you want as a payment? Oh, and I'd make sure to request something not too difficult to acquire, or too immoral. Understand, in my quest to find who had the information, I've already spoken with Papa Legaba. I'm sure that that's just a hop skip and a jump away from Siren being called in. As I recall, the last time you two danced, it didn't go so well for you, which may be the reasoning for your current *accommodations*.
"Also, remember the subject of the information that I'm looking for. The Ragetear has never really had a pleasant personality. If he were to find out that someone possessed information about him, I'm sure that that person would quickly find the Armies of Chaos descending upon him ... or her as the case may be. Would that person **really** want to be in possession of said information, and such a beautiful target for the demon general?
"Shudder to think. I'd hope that that person would have the brains needed to realize the danger of their current situation, and want to unload that information as quickly as possible."
(Intimidate +12 to scare Samedi into giving away the information for free or as little as possible.)

Samedi start to laugh, his zombies constricting their grip on Garrif.
"Menacing me won't avail you nothing, but I will tell you whetever you want to know, in exchange for wich, you will owe me a favour, you can either leave now and see your information elsewhere, or you can swear on your powers to repay me a favour whenever I ask you to"
((Well, obviously failed intimidation and mind reading, no fiat, he just made his save, but your sense motive works, so I'll tell you if he tell the truth once he actually start telling you the info.))

(Sorry it took me so long to respond. I was weighing the morale implications that a half-demon would face with this choice.)
No longer struggling against the zombies that were holding him still, and seeing that his efforts to read the Loa's mind were futile, as were his efforts to impress on the same's mind that he should just give up the information, Garrif stared the spirit-possessed body in the eye.
"Well, now, you present me with an interesting choice. I can either owe a favor to a Loa who has been known to do terrible things and would probably request a terrible thing, or I can simply leave here empty handed. You know what? If you had made me this offer some, oh I don't know, seventy years ago, I'd probably have agreed to the favor. However, time does things to a person, even if it doesn't do a whole lot. It changes him in little ways. It shows him that there are other things in life that are more important than revenge. Things that actually grant us some measure of peace and happiness in this life. And I don't think that my grand-daughter would approve of my owing you a favor, when the day came that she found out, and I have no doubt that she'd find out. However, I also don't think that she'd approve of my simply walking away.
"So, I'll do more for you than you did for me. I'll tell you the truth. You can give me the information now, and I will leave your drug dealers alone for a little while in Freedom City, or you can kill me. After that, I'll come right back to find you again and we can perform the exact same dance, if you so wish, probably ending with you killing me again. And I'll come back, again and again and again. I will harass your sellers, I will take down every last one of your operations, if need be, one by one, until you have nothing left. Each time you'll probably kill me again, and each time I will rise again to trouble you more. And one of those times, I might just end up sending you back to the place you came from.
"Do you understand me, Samedi? I will **never** leave you alone. Century after century, millennia after millennia, I will hunt you down and undo every last one of your works to undermine the nature of humanity.
"So, the choices is yours. I will allow you to take advantage of the stupidity of **some** humans for a time, or I will destroy every one of your operations for all time. Take your pick."

Baron samedi exploded in a good spirited laugh.
"you have guts little one, I like that" his eyes then grew cold and he looked down at garriff "But don't make the mistake of believing I'm afraid of you, I wonder how your so called immortality would serve you if you were to be....say....digested"
On clue the zombie holding garriff down moans, his stench erupting again from his mouth
"If not, I'm sure I will find a way to keep you from causing any trouble, but I will tell you what I know"
Samedi pauses for dramatic effect and then smile.
"Nothing, it's all I know, I know nothing of your demon, they are unrully and cannot be commanded, I have no interest in them when my servants prove to be able to do such a nice job. I do however know of someone growing desperate"
The zombies release garrif and leave the room, with samedi stepping back into the shadows, his voice coming from far away as he disappear.
"Look for a crossroad"

Garrif waved his hand in front of his face as the zombies left, trying to dissipate their stench from the area.
Hearing Samedi's comments, Garrif raises an eyebrow and turns and leaves the house.
"Don't worry, Baron. I'll you again, I'm sure."
As Garrif left the house, he thought about the words, *find a crossroad*. So, Samedi wanted him to summon a demon? Well that would be interesting to say the least.
Garrif quickly checked his watch to make sure that his appointments with the church weren't being forgotten. After that, he summoned a portal to The Rectory and began his research into locating the most powerful crossroads in the area. He compared leylines and omens, looking for the most secure sight to summon a demon.

The day comes to an end before Garrif ends his research, however on the next day he find the perfect spot, somewhere deep in the wharton state forest, at the crossroad of two very old forest tracks, the ritual itself would take a little over an hour to perform, significantly less if garrif manages to secure the blood of a virgin.

## Re: Lost lore of Eldritch : Garrif story

### **Anonymous** (2009-08-15 09:53:03)

Garrif grimaced and shook his head as he found the description of how to make the ritual go significantly faster.
*Blood of a virgin? Sheesh!*
Still, while the thought disgusted him now, he knew that a century ago, he would have done it without thinking twice. Having a family does things to a man, ... even a half-man half-demon.
Realizing that this would be even more complicated than usual, Garrif put aside his completed notes for the summoning ritual and headed into his library and began the research into a powerful artifact that would bind the demon. Finding the designs amongst the scrolls of the followers of Bal'Hemoth, Garrif thought that this might do the trick, especially if he added a little kick to it.
Garrif immediately sent his golems to get the necessary materials from his stores and set about to make the Chains of Bal'Hemoth, chains that could be anchored to the ground and spring the moment a demon appeared from the ritual, trapping the demon. The kick that he planned to add was that the chains would be made of iron, normally harmful to demons, but thanks to his mother not to him. This iron in the ore would hopefully make the demon summoned weak enough for Garrif to probe it's mind and find the information he wanted.
He would find the Ragetear. He had to, to protect Aurora.
(Starting the Research phase of artificing for the following artifact:
**Chains of Bal'Hemoth (Linked)**
**Snare 8** (Linked; DC 18; Entangle; Triggered (When a demon Appears))
**Drain 8** (Linked; drains: single trait - strength, DC 18)
Total cost of 17 PP. So, the research phase shouldn't take more than 17 hours with a DC 27 (taking 10 on the Knowledge (arcane lore) for a total of 28) and 68 hours to build with a DC of 27 (taking 10 on that one too). Total time for this one should be 85 standard hours, or 17 for the real world since time inside of the workshops moves 5 times faster than outside.)

As the morning came and the sun rose on the world, Garrif stood at the crossroads in the forest, having set his Chains of Bal'Hemoth trap and began casting the ritual needed to summon the demon. The Beast of Bal'Hemoth spell worked very well in this regard, though it took Garrif a while to cast it the first time through. As Garrif wove the words with the movements of his hands, arcane symbols appeared on the ground in the form of a circle surrounded by the chain trap. Garrif waited for the spell to do its work, knowing the dangers of summoning a demon to the physical realm. However, he needed the information, and Garrif wanted to meet any demon that might have a grudge against the Ragetear.

The light in the forest dimmed, the sky being covered by dark clouds as the final words of the incantation were being spoken. For a while nothing happens, no explosion of hellfire no curtain of darkness,, nothing. And then, when Garrif blinks he is suddenly there, a middle aged caucasian male dressed in a sharp italian suit looks at him, the chain of the spell holding him in place
"Now, I assure you, all this theatrics with those chains is completely unecessery, I believ you wanted to talk to a demon correct ?"

Garrif looked on the demon trapped in chains with a smile.
*Let's just hope those things hold.*
**"I must compliment you on your dress."** Garrif began. **"The suit really sells the businessman look. As to the chains, I'm sure that you can understand my caution when dealing with one of you."**
Garrif weighed his words carefully before continuing.
**"I'm sure you know who I am. I'm also sure that you know what I personally would be looking for. I'm looking for information on the Ragetear. I've been all over the city this morning, including a rather unpleasant meeting with Baron Samedi.

Now, were was I ? Ah yes, you tried to summon a demon but instead you have me. Well I felt the need to intervene since you have been chasing your tail for quite some time now, you miight want to work a little on your understanding of hidden meanings.
"The man smile pleasently, moving close to Garrif"
This time I will give a little bit of help, no price attached. They told you it had to do with the Loa and then they told you to seek a crossroad. You're not supposed to hunt down a demon, you're supposed to find the namesake of the crossroad
"He waits patiently for Garrif to draw a conclusion from this"
Well, in any case, you're looking for Maitre Carrefour.
As for information about the Ragetear, I could provide them to you and I could even grant you enough power to get permanently rid of this thorn at your side. No string attached. Call me if you decide it might be worth your while.

Garrif stood looking rather dumbfounded as the sharp dressed man disappeared.
*Well, don't I feel like an idiot.*
Pocketing the business card, Garrif quickly realized that with this bit of free information, he needed an address to go with it. Well, it was time to pay a visit to Jon Wilson, a police officer that Garrif had helped out a few months ago. Pulling out his cell phone, he pulled out the number and called up Officer Wilson.
**"Officer Wilson? This is Garrif. Yes, *that* Garrif. I need an address. Where are you at the moment?"**
As soon as Garrif had the address, he opened a portal to a more private location near there (bathroom, broom closet, etc.) and threw over his usual glamour of a greasy street kid and went looking for Officer Wilson.

The greasy haired kid smiled as he sat down opposite Officer Wilson.
"Officer Wilson, are you saying you're not happy to be visiting with an old friend. One who's helped you out from time to time?"
Without waiting for a comment, Garrif took a napkin and wrote a name on it before sliding it over to the cop.
Maitre Carrefour

the officer sighed and looked down at the name
"not to make a bad pun here but that one is bad mojo, some voodoo freak that even other voodoo freak don't like, he was called a bokkor when I was investigating him, not sure what that means. He had his hands in various scheme but nothing could ever be proven, he was smart enough to stay out of sight for a while, he is an old man now. I'm not exactly sure where he is but I heard a rumour that he was going to after a jpiece of jewelry, the ring of ages that's all I know really."

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-08 13:38:43)

Garrif listened to Wilson's description of the man in question, nodding at the mention of the title bokor.
*That makes some sense, then. I just went too high up the food chain. Also, since most bokurs work for Samedi, that explains why Papa Legaba thought I should ask him. I might need to apologize to Samedi.*
That last thought made Garrif's stomach turn, just a bit.
When Wilson mentioned the Ring of Ages, though, Garrif's head stopped nodding. He froze completely still and forgot for a second where he was, letting his glamor waver just a bit. Just enough for the officer to see Garrif's red eyes.
"Did you just say, 'Ring of Ages'? Jon," using the officer's first name was a rare occasion in Garrif's dealings with him, "if this Maitre Carrefour gets his hands on that ring, things will go **very** badly for a great many people in the city. I need to know everything you know about Carrefour, address, hang outs, friends, rap sheet, everything."
Garrif began listening in on Jon's mind, something he normally wouldn't do to a friend, but he needed to make sure that the officer wasn't leaving out even the tiniest detail.
"And just to be clear, Jon. I don't want you going after Carrefour yourself. If he's gotten his hands on that ring, you will **not** be able to do anything about it except to get yourself killed. If this is THE Ring of Ages, you'd be better off leaving this up to me."

The officer gasped softly when he saw Garrif eyes but gave him all that he knew about Carrefour. Sadly most of the information is dated and useless. Past contacts : dead, ancient holding places: deserted.

Garrif nods as Officer Wilson gives him the mostly useless information, just to be polite. When he comes across the stray thought that Officer Wilson thought useless, but actually was valuable, Garrif said nothing, not wanting the officer to worry about a mind reader along with whatever else he had on his plate.
When it was all said and done, he thanked the policeman and promptly got up from the table and headed for the street. Walking down the street and turning down the first empty alley he finds, Garrif summons a portal straight to Lincoln.
*Time to find this Carrefour and make sure he doesn't do something profoundly stupid.*

As garrif walk trough Lincoln he can't sense anything amiss, but then he step into a back alley and his immediatly assaulted by the feeling of extremely powerful magic, whatever caused this managed to limit to aura to just a few hundreds yard, explaining why no one picked up on it since Lincoln isn't readily pattroled by mages.
Garrif is quick to identify the point of origin of the magical aura and walks toward a deserted building.

Garrif enter an unfirnished room whose sole distinctiveness is the bald man of apparent indian origin (as in India, not American indian) wrapped in a toga. He is meditating, floating a few inches in the air, a ring floating in front of him with tendrils of energy passing from the rings to him. A closer inspection quickly reveal that this is the ring of ages, and the man is obviously maitre carrefour. It seems like the ring is slowly being drained of it's powers.

Realizing that the ritual had to be stopped, Garrif immediately reached into his pouch and pulled out some ground rat bone and threw it into the air. Chanting in a language that is now old and forgotten to most mortals, he began to trace symbols in the air and on the floor. This was going to take time, he knew, but so be it. This needed to stop. The Ring of Ages could not fall into the wrong hands. The ritual's movements eventually had Garrif make his way to the ring, which he would grab at the right moment to seal it. This would hopefully cut off Carrefour's connection with the Ring, and end the draining of its power.

Maitre Carrefour cries out in anguish, the backlash of energy he suffers aging him greatly as the effect of his ritual are reversed.
He is now no more than a frail old man, barely able to move on his own.

Garrif breathed heavy, having finished the ritual, but just barely in time. Holding the Ring of Ages in his hand, Garrif shook from effort as the adrenaline ebbed from his muscles. Pulling his trembling hand back on himself, he held the fabled ring in his hand for a moment, pondering the powers that he could wield with it, before shaking his head and tucking the ancient artifact into a pouch on his hip.
*I'll have to leave this with Eldritch. He's probably the only one that could keep it safe for the long run.*
Looking down at the now old man, Garrif shook his head in sorrow.
"Maitre Carrefore, this is what happens when you try to mess with the powers of the universe. However, there are worse things in existence besides being aged beyond your years. There is, for example, the eternal punishment that demons usually bring with them. I'm told that you possess some information on a particular demon. One Ragetear, General of the Armies of Chaos."
Leaning in on the frail old man, the half-demon smiled, flashing his blood-red eyes.
"So, do you tell me what I want to know, allowing me to take you to a hospital, or do I summon one of the servants of the Pit to come collect you? After, of course, **forcibly** taking what information I seek."
