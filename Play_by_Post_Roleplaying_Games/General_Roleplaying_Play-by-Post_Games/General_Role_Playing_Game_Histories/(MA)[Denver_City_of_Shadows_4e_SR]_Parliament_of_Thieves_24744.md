[4th Edition Shadowrun. This thread is rated MA for mature content.]
**Pueblo Corporate Council Sector - Johnny's Place, 2 PM**
Not having had the strength to make it all the way to the bedroom Johnny is lying on his couch recovering from last night's debauchery. A sudden screeching pierces his ears; he'd been unable to mute his commlink last night in his inebriated state. Wondering who could be calling him at this hour (didn't they know it was 2 in the afternoon and he had a hangover?!) Johnny manages to answer the commlink without breaking it. The familiar face of Marcus appears on the commlink's screen.
**"Johnny!"**
It appears distance really does make the heart grow fonder, though the dwarf's enthusiasm fades when he see's Johnny's miserable expression.
**"You look like hell,"** he quips. **"What happe-"** he starts to ask before thinking better of it, **"Nevermind don't answer that."**
**"Look I know the transition hasn't been easy for you but I found ya some work. There's a Johnson looking for new faces in town. He's holding a meeting at a nightclub called Denim, 4:30 sharp. I've taken the liberty of transferring a map to your commlink. It's in the Pueblo Sector so even you shouldn't have too much trouble finding it,"** he concludes with a smile.
==============================================================
**Pueblo Corporate Council Sector - Fade's Place, 2 PM**
The rhythmic *thump* of fists hitting a punching bag fills the air as Maeda practices. She's still getting used to the thin mountain air and feeling slightly out of breath. A slight sheen of sweat has begun to cover her when Maeda feels the mental tingling of a commlink call. The call is from her fixer, Kazakami Johnny, so the assassin ends her routine early with a vicious kick that threatens to remove the bag from its mounting. An AR window pops up revealing Johnny's visage.
**"Hello Fade. There's a Johnson looking for fresh blood in Denver. The meet's scheduled for 4:30 PM at Denim, a club in the PCC sector. Any questions?"**
The half-Asian seems all business and awaits Fade's response with a stoic expression.
==============================================================
**United Canadian and American States Sector - Frost's Place, 2 PM**
A spectacular vista of clear skies and snow-capped peaks stretches before Frost. He can see his own breath as he slowly trudges up the side of a mountain. With considerable effort Frost reaches the summit to reveal an ancient, crumbling temple of Buddhist design. Flickering candlelight from within beckons him onward. Frost enters the temple's sanctum to be greeted by a rack of fragile scrolls. This is what he had made the arduous journey for. As he moves toward the first scroll with hand outstretched the familiar sensation of a commlink call stops him in midstride. The call is from Red Tag and his bank account says he can't afford to blow the fixer off. Frost sighs, oh well, he'd gotten here once, he could do so again. The world goes black for an instant and he opens his eyes to the much less spectacular scene of a low-rent apartment. He shakes his head to clear the cobwebs of VR from his mind and answers the call.
**"Hoi, what's up chummer?"** Red Tag asks with a smile, though it's clearly more of a greeting than a question.
**"Listen, there's a Johnson trying to get a run together with some shiny new faces. The meet n' greet's at some Amerind club called Denim in the Pueblo Sector. Ya got 2 and half hours to grab your kit and get the hell over there. Any questions *omae*?"**
==============================================================
**United Canadian and American States Sector - Jackson's Place, 2:05 PM**
With a sigh Jackson heaves himself unto the sofa and cracks a beer. He'd been out for hours working the local runner hot spots with no success. Fortunately it would be awhile before rent was due but his finances weren't looking so hot right now. The chime of a commlink call intrudes on his thoughts, grabbing the 'link Jackson sets down his beer. It's from Red Tag, Jackson had called him earlier and he was finally calling back. Hoping for good news Jackson answers and Red Tag's face appears on his image link.
**"Jackson, my man, you're in luck. There's a Johnson looking for fresh faces in the Denver underground. He's puttin' a team together for a run today. 4:30 at Denim, some Amerind club in the Pueblo Sector. Ya interested *omae*?"**
==============================================================
**Pueblo Corporate Council Sector - Jin's Place, 2 PM**
A wailing guitar and some killer lyrics marked Jin as being home. The staccato thumps on the wall meant his neighbor was home as well and that Jin was, as usual, being too loud. Also as usual, Jin ignored them. However, a different song reached his ears during a rest, the ringtone of his commlink. Jin hates to stop in the middle of a song but he could use a job and it's unlikely this is just a social call. He simply hasn't been in Denver long enough to have many friends. Granting his neighbor temporary relief Jin stops and answers the call. The familiar face of Hideo Kumigawa, the man who was quickly becoming Jin's new best friend, shows up on his screen.
**"Hey Jin, for a minute there I didn't think you were gonna answer. Are you ever *not* practicing?"** he asks rhetorically.
**"Anyways, it looks like I found some work for you…and not the musical variety. The Johnson wants new faces for a run today and you're the very definition of a new face. The meet's at Denim, some club in the Pueblo Sector, at 4:30. I don't know much else but ask away if you have any questions."**

Frost gets up and starts gathering his gear as he talks. While he does he mentally triggers a matrix search on the Club Denim
<<[Moto] Data search: Club Denim Pueblo sector Denver >>
"Did he give an idea of what he wants? Has he ever worked with you before?"

**UCAS Sector - Frost's Place**
Red Tag shakes his head, **"No I've never worked with the guy before. All he would say is that it's courier work. Sorry chummer, I don't know much else, but you should probably be ready to run when you get there."**
An AR window pops open in the corner of your vision. You've connected to Denim's node, which is sculpted to resemble a normal building. Probably what the club looks like in real life. From the node you are able to determine the club is located at 10151 W. 26th Ave, the drink specials, and that a Tribal Rock band is booked for tonight.
((You may continue searching if you wish.))

## Re: Parliament of Thieves

### **Frost** (2010-07-11 00:58:28)

Frost starts cleaning his weapons and prepping his gear. His hands break down the weapons almost on their own while his mind continues with other important items.
**"Thanks Red Tag, I'll check in with you when it's over and give ya your cut chummer."**
He cuts the comm connection and finishes his work in almost a zen like manner. Weapons cleaned, gear checked and stored. He has a quick sanisteam to clean off the grime and make himself presentable. He checks his map softs and familiarizes himself with the area around the club making notes of escape routes on his gps. He also charts several routes to the club finding the quickest he heads down to his bike and starts checking it over. About an hour before the meet he gears up and heads towards the club. He feels his connection with the bike as the sim rig takes control. He feels the harsh road under his wheels as he heads down the street towards his next potential job.

**UCAS Sector**
Frost's mapsoft calculates two routes. He can take the interstate and cross directly into the Pueblo Sector or he can take city streets and cross through the CAS Sector. The interstate is slightly faster and has only one border crossing, but that border will have heavy security. The city streets will require two border crossings but should have lighter security.

Jackson replies “**Red Tag. My personal bearer of good news. Good afternoon, sir. Yes, I am interested. Although, having said that, do you have any details on the Johnson? Are they reputable? I don’t want to know where he went to college at or where she buys her pumps, but rather, I want to know personally, if you got a good feeling about it?**”
Jackson was told that Red Tag was a decent guy and he’d never purposely put a runner in harm’s way, but he figured there’s no harm in asking. As he’s talking, a flashback comes to mind; Jackson can hear Frost talking to the squad before they went over the wall that day, Frost shouting over the whacking of the chopper on the tarmac.
“**Remember! The Corps, The Unit, then God, you got me? When we’re out there, I want a 100% of your attention, and 110% of your effort, you copy?**” To which the squad replied in unison “**UURRAAH!**”
Jackson snaps back “**Whatta ya say, Red? Does the Johnson check out?**”

*"KIAAAAI!"* the young assassin exclaims as she punches the bag one final time, before accepting the call. As Johnny appears Fade shows no expressions and simply listens to him telling about the possible future job. As he finishes, she instantly follows up, her voice cold and not betraying how she feels, if she feels anything.
*"Can you tell me more about this Denim? Is there a particular dress code? Can you tell me about their security? And send me a map of the area if you can find one. And do you know whether or not Mr. Johnson can be trusted?"* She wasn't going to take the front door if they would be scanning her for cyberware. And the map would simply give her a knowledge of the area, so that she could set up a few escape routes, just in case it turned out to be a trap, rather than an actual job.
As she was saying and thinking this, she also was using the matrix to access road maps, so that she could set up the fastest way to Denim and a route away which would perhaps not be the fastest, but which also gave her plenty of opportunity to detect anyone following, so that she could get rid of anyone in pursuit.
Some might call her paranoid, but Fade saw it as perfectly logical, figuring that you never know when people stab you in the back, so best to prepare for contingencies for when it happens.

Red Tag nods in understanding.
**"I scan you chummer but I'm afraid I don't have a lot to go on. I've never worked with the Johnson before but I wouldn't call you if I had bad vibes."**
He smiles reassuringly, **"However, you can take some solace in the fact that he asked for new faces, not anyone in particular."**
==============================================================
**PCC Sector - Fade's Place**
If Johnny is surprised by Fade's icy demeanor he doesn't show it.
**"It's an Amerind club. You'll have trouble fitting in no matter what you wear. As for the security I don't know, but it's a nightclub not a corporate headquarters."**
Johnny does seem surprised, or perhaps amused, when she asks about maps.
**"Maps aren't my area of expertise, you're on your own there. The Johnson seems as reliable as any other. This isn't the business for money-back guarantees."**
As he's speaking an AR window pops open in Maeda's field of vision. A street map of the Edgewater neighborhood appears with Denim's location marked.

**"Hmmmm? Patty you dirty dwarf you… yes do that again…."** Johnny says before he comes fully awake. **"Hold on a moment! You aren't Patricia! Where is Patricia you miscreant!! I'll…"** he begins to rant from the floor of he apartment disheveled and hungover. After deciding he didn't want the details, Marcus simply continued speaking, telling Johnny of the job.
**"Oh Marcus! How are you? When did you call?"** Johnny continues rambling after coming mostly to his senses and realizing who he was speaking to. He looks at the time on his rather old pocket watch and his voice climbs to a pitch rarely heard, **"Why in the bloody *blue BLAZES* have you called me at such an ungodly hour?"** Then his addled brain registers what Marcus had just finished telling him and he continues: **"But Marcus, four thirty tomorrow? Don't you think that's a bit short notice? I don't even know the man! And besides, this club, 'Denim,' sounds rather plain, if not downright tacky, don't you agree?"**

**UCAS Sector - Jackson's Place**
Jackson takes a moment to consider this information and decides he needs the work.
“**Red, sir, I’m your man. Count me in and that’s 430, @ the Denim, Amerind Sector. Got it. Thanks again. I appreciate it, Red**.”
Jackson signs off. He starts to a net search of the club, and then plots an optimal course to that physical location. After the course has been plotted, he calculates the time it will take to get there, allowing himself a good 30 minute window so that he will arrive at 1600.
((**OOC: Val, not really familiar with Denver. Are there several checkpoints in which runners will be frisked for weapons enroute to this club? I would like to know, because IF the information is common sense [i.e. most folks know not to try cross borders while rolling heavy b/c they tend to arrested or shot] then that will determine whether or not Jackson will pack a little heat and alot of heat.**))

**PCC Sector - Johnny's Place**
Marcus merely shakes his head with a rueful expression at Johnny's antics.
**"Tomorrow? No Johnny I'm afraid it's even shorter notice than that. The meeting is today. I'd have contacted you earlier but this is the first I've heard about it."**
The dwarf pauses for a moment to let that sink in.
**"And yes, I doubt the club will suit your…distinguishing tastes, but a job's a job."**
==============================================================
**UCAS Sector - Jackson's Place**
Jackson's search reveals that Denim is indeed an Amerind club and actually quite popular. Many top notch Tribal Rock bands from all around the NAN have performed there. He calculates it will take anywhere from forty minutes to an hour to get to the club, counting border crossings. The interstate will be slightly faster and only require one border crossing. Taking city streets will require two border crossings but those checkpoints should be less secure. Either way will require passing through a scanner. Licensed pistols are generally accepted but trying to cross the border with an assault rifle could prove difficult.

"I see..." is the comment from the assassin to the fixer. "Very well, I will go to this Denim club and meet up with the Johnson." With that said the connection to Johnny is cut off and the assassin quickly cleans up and puts on her expensive looking suit, checks her weaponsa nd fastens them in their appropriate positions, before she heads out to her bike, rhe lightning fast Suzuki Mirage.
With a single mental command the agent in the bike's computer starts up the bike with a loud wroom and then Fade heads off, the direction towards Pueblo and this Denim. It is with a very high pace that the assassin proceeds towards her possibly future employer, waving in and out amongst the cars that she passes on the way.

**PCC Sector - 2:45 PM**
Fade artfully threads through other vehicles and poor road conditions alike. Her driving elicits a couple of rude gestures but otherwise she reaches the club without incident. The parking lot is mostly deserted at this time of day. Denim is a fairly nondescript building from the outside though a neon sign clearly marks this is the place. Maeda's rapid pace as left her with plenty of time before the meet.
==============================================================
**Interstate 70 Exit 281, Pueblo Corporate Council, Sector Demarcator - 3:50 PM**
Frost feels every hum and vibration of the bike through his control rig and handles it like an extension of his own body. Traffic is still relatively light and he is able to make good time. Soon he reaches the exit and approaches the Pueblo Sector border. A bunker that looks like it might be able to withstand a direct hit from anything short of a nuclear bomb marks the border. Traffic splits into multiple lanes funneled through sensor stations and guard booths.
A Native American male in a border patrol uniform, complete with armored jacket and an AK-97, waves Frost to a halt. The patrolman directs Frost to a smaller lane, clearly designed for motorcycles. A sign reads 'To facilitate procedures have SINs ready for scanning'.
Frost pulls up to the designated lane to be stopped by a female officer, also clearly of Native American descent. She holds a commlink ready to scan SINs and licenses.
**"State your reasons for entering the sector and declare any restricted goods now,"** she says in what is obviously a well rehearsed speech.

**"Marcus dear, today is simply out of the question,"** Johnny replies, **"I have three dates scheduled for *reasonable* hours tonight and …"** he drifts off, absentmindedly patting around his clothing and digging out his credstick to check the state of his revelry funds.
**"Four thirty you say? I can be there, though fashionably late of course. I assume it pays well?"** he continues with a rueful look after seeing the state of his finances.
As he waits he sets the comlink down and begins hurrying around the apartment gathering his running equipment, stripping out of his soiled clothing and digging out a fresh tuxedo. *Let's see, rubber chicken? Check. Playing cards? Check. Cane? Check. Top hat? Check. Glasses? Check. That damned paperwork Marcus insisted I carry? Check. Am I missing anything?* he pauses, caught in the middle of pulling on his pants, wondering what he was forgetting. **"Ah ha!"** he exclaims, *My pistols. Nearly forgot them again.*

Frost stops the bike and dials back the control rig so he can distinguish between his own heartbeat and bikes engine. Frost pulls up a transfer window in AR and transmits his SIN and License information. He hopes the fake SIN and licenses that RedTag set up for him with stand the scrutiny. Here goes nothing.
**<<[Moto] Begin SIN & license transfer>>**
He pulls up the face shield on his helmet and smiles at the officer.
**"I'm just hear for a little music and drinks."**

**PCC Sector - Johnny's Place, 2:02 PM**
Marcus smiles at Johnny's sudden change of opinion; he knew his friend needed work whether Johnny would admit it or not.
**"I don't know the specifics on payment Johnny, you'll have to discuss that with the Johnson."**
The hacker sighs, knowing his next statement might not go over so well.
**"But while we're on the subject of payment…do try to remember that you're a newcomer to Denver. You can't expect to pull down big figures without the rep to back it up."**
==============================================================
**PCC, Sector Demarcator**
The officer consults her commlink and seems satisfied with the results. She transmits a small file back and looks up.
**"Alright you've been issued a two day travel pass. If you need to extend your stay please consult the Pueblo Corporate Council Department of Immigration. Drive slowly through the scanner and enjoy your stay."**
Frost pulls forward while the scanner searches for any contraband. Fortunately he has nothing to hide and is cleared through the border. He's made it into the Sector without any trouble...this time.

**"Don't worry darling, I'll be sure to wow them suitably before long,"** Johnny says with a wink and a grin, **"Ta for now dear. I must find a cab if I'm to make this intolerably early meeting,"** he finishes as he walks out the door, heading for the street to hail a cab while straightening his tie and glasses.

### **Frost** (2010-07-13 05:17:07)

Once he clears the scanners Frost speeds down the highway following the Augmented Reality GPS software glowing line down the road. He also sets his comm link code to private mode. He makes sure to stick to around the speed limit. No point in attracting any unwanted attention. When he reaches the club he scouts around for a few minutes and finds a safe place to park his bike. He gets off the bike and straightens out his clothes. He checks the scout hidden in a concealable holster on his back.
**"Well time to go to work devil dog."**
He starts walking towards the club

Fade climbs off the Mirage, commanding the pilot to shut down manually, since she keeps her commlink running hidden. Though she has arrived, she doesn't enter the club yet. Instead she's quickly scouting the surroundings, taking note of the club and all openings that can serve as a quick exit if it is necessary. Also she's quickly checking over those entering and leaving the club, whether or not they are carrying concealed weaponry or has obvious parts, anything that may indicate that this meeting is more dangerous than Johnny made it sound.

**UCAS Sector** 
Jackson decides he doesn’t need to get nabbed by the locals for carrying illegal heavies into NAN territory. He thinks the better of it, and saddles up his concealable holster, packs the Colt 2066 and 1 clip of normal ammo, leaving the clip unloaded. He uploads his pistol license (Rating 1), don’s his armored jacket, Gargoyle “Specs” sunglasses, his ear bud and sets his commlink to monitor any local traffic feeds, so he can make adjustments if needs to. He leave his apartment at about 1530, deciding to take the surface streets, planning to blend in with the local rush hour.
He thinks he made the right decision in going with the Mirage; the Kamikaze detail package was a nice added bonus. He straddles the bike, starts the engine, adjusts his glasses, gooses the throttle a couple of times, and then he is a dot in the distance. ‘**Surface streets, you really get know a city when you know how to navigate its underbelly’** he thinks to himself as cruises down the boulevard, gently weaving passed slower traffic.
As the first checkpoint comes into view, he slows down, and falls in behind a family van, waiting his turn in line.

**PCC Sector - 2:50 PM**
Johnny takes in the thin air of Denver as he waits for a cab. Soon a surly looking troll pulls up in a clearly marked cab. After a moment's hesitation Johnny gets in, it's not that troll but ever since then he's been a bit jumpy.
The cab passes through the residential area known as Edgewater and arrives at Denim.
**"20 nuyen,"** barks the troll, the first words he's spoken since asking for a destination.
==============================================================
**PCC Sector - Denim, 2:50 PM**
Maeda takes a quick reconnoiter around the building and discovers there are four entrances total. The main entrance is on the north side. There are two emergency exits, one on the east side and one on the west side. Finally a back door on the south side is marked for deliveries. There are no windows.
No one has entered or left the club since Fade's arrival. However, as she comes back around to the parking lot a cab pulls up. In it is a short latino wearing a purple tuxedo, complete with matching top hat and glasses.
==============================================================
**UCAS/CAS Sector Demarcator - 3:30 PM**
Jackson pulls up to the boundary which is marked by a 30 meter stretch of no-man's-land bounded by six meter high concrete walls. The UCAS wall is topped with vicious looking razorwire. A small patrol station rests on each side of the border. This checkpoint is only setup for pedestrian and bike traffic.
Jackson is waved through the UCAS border and drives through the no-man's land. A small fence of purely symbolic value marks the actual border halfway through. At the CAS side he is met by an officer who was watching a small trid-viewer before Jackson's arrival.
**"ID and licenses,"** he says gruffly.

Jackson plays it cool. ‘**I come here all the time. I'm a regular**’ he thinks to himself.
Jackson offers up the Fake Sin (R:2) and Pistol license (R:1). Jackson keeps his hands in plain sight, and his movements are slow and deliberate. He’s heard about the ‘border patrols’ in this part of the world; nothing to be trifled with.

As the officer scans your information his eyes light up so suddenly Jackson almost doesn't notice it. The man looks up with a normal expression though he seems more interested in his job than he did just a few seconds ago.
**"You've been selected for a random search. Follow me."**
The officer starts towards the patrol building while waving another patrolman over to take his place. He looks back to make sure Jackson is following him. In his eyes Jackson can see a familiar gleam, it looks like greed.
((What's the name on your fake SIN? I can pick one at random if you don't want to come up with one. I just need to know what the officer will call you.))

**CAS Border Patrol Building**
The guard, his name tag reads Hawkins, leads Jackson to a small room inside the patrol building. The room is spartanly furnished, featuring plain white walls, a small desk, and two chairs.
The second guard, Calder, enter behind Jackson and closes the door. Hawkins produces a handheld Magnetic Anomaly Detection scanner and runs it over Jackson. Seemingly satisfied he puts the device away. He looks at Jackson with a sleazy smile.
**"Right, Mr…Boudreaux,"** he gives just enough inflection on the fake name to indicate he doubts its legitimacy.
**"It seems your pistol license has…expired. Now I would be happy to file the appropriate renewal forms for you. There's just the small matter of the…license renewal fee. That will cost you 300 nuyen."**

Jin grinned at his manager. **"'New faces', huh? That some kinda joke, busu?"** He chuckled out the last part as he put the guitar down gently. **"So, we got anymore intel on this? Or am I walking blind like that job with … what was that chinchin's name … Miroko? Man, that was a bad scene, Hideo.

Or a Jitsugyō-ka no ana?"** Again, the rocker chuckled, while changing into more appropriate clothes. **"You know, just want to make sure I'm dressing right for the occasion … and whether there's a chance of me spending some nuyen on something besides the usual ushi, eh?"**

Johnny pays the Troll, tipping him five nuyen. He gives the building and the area a once-over, astrally speaking, before heading inside. He's curious about hidden threats and the general 'vibe' of the club. He lowers his glasses and sweeps his eyes from one side to the other while adjusting his white gloves and the cape over his shoulders.

Hideo laughs, **"No sutorippu kurabu for you my friend. This is supposed to make you money, not provide you with an opportunity to blow it all on cheap women and even cheaper booze!"**
The manager gets slightly more serious as they begin discussing the job.
**"Denim's a pretty happening Amerind bar. Lots of killer Tribal Rock bands play there. I doubt anyone will be playing at 4:30 though,"** he sounds truly apologetic, thinking Jin would enjoy the music even if it isn't exactly his own style.
**"I don't know who else is being recruited for the job but, well, it's hard to get work in this town without some street cred. If you don't like the look of the team you can always back out."**

The cab driver grunts in what passes for appreciation at the tip before driving off. Johnny takes a look at his surroundings before shifting his perception to the astral realm. The first thing he notices is a woman coming around the corner. It is immediately obvious to the magician that she has as much chrome in her as flesh. Her aura radiates a tight focus but it is otherwise devoid of emotion. Sweeping his gaze over the club reveals a handful of metahumans. Most of them seem bored, a few of them appear to be in various states of intoxication. Johnny picks up two magically active astral forms, a magician and the magician's focus. The magician does not seem bored or intoxicated.

Jackson continues on and manages to pass through the Pueblo border with only a minimal hassle. He arrives at the club at 4:10, slightly later than he'd intended.

In the distant and steadily growing louder Jackson hears the sound of another motorcycle.

Frost gets off the interstate and passes by the gigantic Lakeside Amusement Park and Casino on his way into Edgewater.

Jackson! No way it couldn't be, but there he was clear as day. He rolls the bike up next to him and pops open his face plate.
"Hey there Devil Dog! What's a fine upstanding member of society doing in this Drek hole? I thought I trained you to avoid places like these or was that to frequent them."
He parks the bike next to Jackson's and gives his old friend a hug. He eyes his friends bike.
"Nice choice. So how the hell are ya?"
He thinks back to the last time he saw Jackson. He was leading the men towards the back up rendezvous while he kept Col. Tagg's humanis friends busy giving them time to get away.

Jackson looks back at the approaching bike, noting the parked ones. He smiles with confidence ‘**Great minds think alike’**. He watches the rider pull up, park his bike, and he pauses for a moment before he takes off his helmet. As he removes it, Jackson turns to walk away when the rider speaks. At first, Jackson pauses, like he’s just heard a ghostly whisper. Not surprising in these parts, it is Amerind territory after all. He turns on his heel to face the rider, as he looks at him, his mind races, like a trid on extreme fast-forward. ‘**It can’t be’** he says to himself.
Jackson stands there with an expression of pure incredulous disbelief and then he speaks in slow audible tones **“No … Frakkin’ … Way … SGT. FRAKKIN’ FROST! YOU BASTARD YOU!!**” Jackson walks over to the man in long strides grabbing him on both shoulders. He looks him over, patting him on his deltoids, shaking his hand. Sgt. Richard Frost, the only marine that Jackson would have taken a bullet for, has just suddenly been resurrected.
“H**oly drek, I knew it had to be you! I knew it! You had to be the one that took a pot-shot at Tagg! You sly bastard! It’s damn good to see you, Frost, damn good. How in the hell have you been?? Where you been hiding? How’d you make it out of the corridor? Holy drek, I’m rambling here! Wait … what ARE you doing here, in Denver?**” Jackson pauses for a moment, looks around and then quickly takes stock of everything. “**You aren’t … are you here to ‘meet’ someone?**” Jackson points to the club behind him.

Frost is glad to see a face he knows he can trust. In the shadows that was something very important. Frost glances around as Cpl Jackson starts talking about Tagg. Frost realizes that Tagg probably knows it was him and will be coming for him sooner or later but he will deal with that bridge when he has to cross it.
**"Keep your voice down Cpl. I don't know what your talking about."**
At the are you here to 'meet' someone comment he gives a smile and a wink.
**"Yea I've been doing a little grey work since my military career is shot. I doubt I'm eligible for my benefits. Got bills to pay and mouths to feeds they say.

Jackson picks up on Frost’s visual and vocal cues and takes the hint. He smiles and nods and leans within whispering distance of Frost.
“**Right. Lost myself there for a moment. Red Tag. Yeah I got a similar message. I heard there was nuyen to be made in Denver, so I made my way out here. I was recommended to him by a merc named Blackthorne. We worked together out in Chicago. He moved out here a few months ago, so I decided to check it out. Frost, I never thought in a million years I’d see you alive and here of all places. You gotta know, someone up there still likes you.**”

Jackson waits till Frost has entered the club and as if by reflex, takes one last look at outside and double checks the parking lot before closing the door behind him. Jackson adjusts his ‘specs’ to process ambient light, illuminating the darker, more shadowy areas of this place. His walks behind and to the right of Frost, slowly pivoting his head to see and take in the patrons, making note of any entrances or exits the place has. He looks for obvious EXIT signs, where the bathrooms are, where the entrance to the kitchen is. He starts to make mental notes about how fast and how quickly he could cover the distance with people in the way. Jackson follows Frost to the bar.

After finishing checking all exits and entrances, she takes note of the newcomer, in particular the security procedures he will go through when he enters. If there's strict security she will find another way in, but if security is a bit lax, she's just going to walk in through the front door. So the well dressed assassin is stalking around just outside the club, trying to make it appear that she's busy talking (Japanese) on her commlink, but keeping an eye out.

Frost enters with Jackson close behind him. The pair is immediately hit by the blast of tribal beats booming from the club’s sound system; though considering the early hour the music is merely loud instead of eardrum shattering. Inside they see a few wageslaves seated around the bar, trying to relax after the day’s grind. The bartender, a tired and worn looking middle-aged human woman dressed in traditional Hopi garb, gives them a hard stare as they walk in.
The bar has synthetic dark wood paneling, and the walls are covered in Hopi artwork and memorabilia. A small stage and dance floor are set off to one side of the bar. Several trids are showing various sportscasts and local news.
((Whether you see the other players depends on what they’re doing…))
**PCC Sector – Denim, 2:50 PM**
Johnny is still holding the door open so Fade can see inside. She sees no security present. Common sense says there’s probably at least one bouncer but one is not at the door at this early time of the day.

Johnny nods politely to the two men he let in while standing there holding the door for the lady who simply wandered the parking lot, *Maybe she's not the club type,* he thinks before giving up and going on inside. *Mustn't look like part of the staff after all.*
Not enjoying the decor he looks around for the Johnson while he debates trying to call Marcus back. In the meantime he wanders towards the bar intent on discovering what peasants like these drink to forget their miserable little lives, **"Madam? What have you on the menu?"** he asks the bartender.

Taking a quick look around, he noted any points of entrance or exit, including windows, doors, and exhaust areas. *Never can be too careful,* he considered to himself. As he caught up to the door, Jin attempted to examine the man a bit, wondering if he was a doorman, or some businessman out on a leash.

<<[Jackson]What do you think the odds are that these people we came in with are here for the job also? Place is kinda dead for this many people to just show up at the same time.

I’m the bar, followed by some overturned. The door should fall fairly easily. Tactical fallback? God, I haven’t used that term in awhile.** >>
Upon receiving the shot, Jackson offers a up a brief and almost non-existent toast to Frost, nods and says a low grumble ‘Semper Fi’. Jackson recalls a tidbit of training back when he was in AIT. He can recall the instructor shouting to the class during a live fire exercise; the sounds of gun fire and artillery shells bombing the landscape are coming back to him in 3D sound.
“**Listen up! Marines do not retreat! Marines fall back to a tactical position. If you use the word ‘retreat’ on my training course, I will shoot you myself, just to put your pathetic existence out of my misery! Do you pick up what I am putting down?!?”** A chorus of young marines shout back “**Sir, yes, sir!**”

Those inside the bar can see two emergency exits on opposite sides of the building. A sign indicates an alarm will activate if the emergency doors are opened. On the opposite side of the room from the front door there are two exits. A set of swinging double doors with small windows probably leads to a kitchen while another door is unmarked and offers no real clues as to what lies on the other side. The few other patrons seem like typical working stiffs and don’t appear particularly threatening.
The bartender pours two shots of top shelf, real tequila and sets them down in front of Frost.
**“Courtesy of Mr. Johnson,”** she says simply. **“He’s waiting for you in the backroom.”**
She indicates the unmarked door before turning to Johnny.
**“What would you like? We have most forms of liquor, several beers, and a red or a white wine.”**

**<<[Jackson] Semper Fidelis my friend. That's what Tagg never learned and that's what will make him pay.>>**
He upends the tequila shot into his mouth and slams glass on the table. The real tequila burns all the way down but its a good burn. He savors the tingle and the taste in his mouth. He has only had real tequila once and that was with Jackson when they went on liberty together in Milwaukee.

Any other night I would encourage such behavior, but a man has to earn yen sometime. Oh, another newcomer who doesn't fit the decor at all. At least he has some taste,* he thinks as his gaze passes over the Asian man coming through the door. *Ah, a mage's work is never done,* he thinks before gazing into the aether again to observe the patrons and newcomers.

Ah, that burn, reminds Jackson of that night when they started that bar fight in Milwaukee. ‘**Good times**’ he thinks to himself. Then he remembers what he had to do to get them released and he shudders, he’s tempted to take another shot, but he’ll wait for this one to kick in first.

Then with only a few minutes left before the deadline of the meeting she finally enters the club, quickly glancing around, checking whether or not 'guests' are carrying weapons, anything to indicate this is a well-thought out trap, rather than a job.
After spending a few seconds running such an analysis, the young girl walks up to the bar and looks at the nearest bartender.
*"Hello, I'm looking for a Johnson. Mr. Johnson. Do you know where I can find him?"* Her expressionless eyes focus on her 'victim', making sure that the attention is more on her than on the rest of the visitors.

**Denim - Main Room**
**"Don't worry about a tab,"** the bartender says to Johnny as she pours his Scotch. It's a moderate brand, nothing high-end in terms of Scotch, but it is *real* Scotch which makes it quite expensive all the same. She also hands him a box of cigarettes, which advertises that the product within is all natural.
**"These are provided by Mr. Johnson. You may find him in the back room when you're ready,"** she concludes.
Drink and cigarettes in hand Johnny scans the bar as his perception slips into the astral. The place becomes bright with astral signatures, a sharp contrast to the smoky shadows that fill the bar in the physical world. Studying the patrons he has assensed before reveals little new information though Johnny notices the bartender seems annoyed as she looks at the two departing military men. The magician appears to be in the back room, where the bartender said you could find Mr. Johnson. Johnny can tell the magician is stronger than him and that two mundane metahuman auras heavy with chrome are also present in the back room. Scanning the military men reveals their cyberware and that they seem happy and nostalgic. The Asian man coming through the door is a powerful Adept projecting a slight feeling of annoyance.
((4 hits on Johnny's Assensing test! He knows the location of everyone's implants, including bioware, though not their exact function. The unknown magician has Magic 6 and a Power Focus 2. Jin has Magic 6.))
Fade enters the club to see the purple clad man who held the door for her and the Japanese man who rushed in after him standing at the bar. Of the two Caucasian men she saw enter there is no sign. The various other patrons do not seem threatening, most likely simple wageslaves.
The bartender studies Maeda and seems slightly surprised when she mentions the "name" Johnson.
**"Uh, he's in the back room,"** the middle-aged woman manages after a moment's pause.
**"Do you…want something to drink? It's on him."** It seems she was about to ask something else but then changed her mind.

Frost and Jackson enter the back room of the club. It is set up like a medicine lodge. The floor is covered in what appear to be authentic skins. Several cushions surround a fire pit in the center of the room, where a small brazier currently burns. The atmosphere is aromatic and smoky, but a metal chimney above the brazier seems to be pulling most of the smoke out of the room.
Directly across from the door, behind the brazier, a man dressed in traditional Hopi garb, including a mask emblazoned with a stylized raven, sits. Beside him are two Amerinds that, judging from their weapons and wary gaze, are obviously bodyguards. He silently gestures for the two men to enter and take a seat.

Watching the bartender eye the departing military men he says, **"Uncouth aren't they? Some never learn proper manners,"** he winks and tips her 20 yen before tucking his cane under one arm and hefting glass and cigarettes and making for the door with an obvious limp.

The bartender seems annoyed that Jin can speak English after all but the tip certainly improves her attitude.
Drink in hand Jin enters the back room. Again the Johnson silently gestures for the newcomer to sit.

Johnny eyes the room before tipping his hat to their host and raising his glass in thanks. At the gesture to sit he replies, **"Many thanks, but my leg makes such seating uncomfortable,"** he says while patting his 'bum' leg where he hides the three and a half foot revolver, **"I'll stand if you don't mind."**
Johnny moves to the wall not far from the door before leaning up against it and taking a sip of his scotch.

**"Konbanwa yoi,"** Jin said as he stepped into the room, drink in hand. **"If you don't mind, I prefer to stand as well."** Looking over the others, he took a place against one of the other walls and drank from his virgin screwdriver. Jin payed special attention to Johnson's body language and movements, possibly trying to gauge more about the person ...

### **Valheru** (2010-07-20 02:05:50)

The only response Mr. Johnson offers to Johnny or Jin is an almost imperceptible nod. The time passes in silence as the assembled group waits on, judging by the number of cushions, one more person. A minute after the appointed meeting time Mr. Johnson finally speaks.
**"Well, it seems our final attendee has been detained,"** he says with obvious displeasure.
**"My name is Mr. Johnson and I would first like to thank-"**
At that moment he is interrupted by the door bursting open. The bodyguards, reacting with preternatural speed, have their machine pistols drawn before an ork barrels into the room. Apparently recognizing the intruder they relax and return their weapons to their holsters. For his part the ork freezes, realizing how close he just came to taking a face full of bullets.
**"Uh…sorry I'm late,"** the ork apologizes while looking suitably contrite.
Impatiently Mr. Johnson motions for the ork to take a seat. Once he does Mr. Johnson continues.
**"As I was saying,"** he begins with a slight sigh of annoyance, **"thank you all for coming. Now, to the matter at hand. The job is a simple courier run. I have a small package that needs to be delivered to a friend. The package must be delivered in the strictest confidence. Unfortunately I have reason to believe that some people would prefer not to see the package arrive safely. Thus, suitable precautions will need to be taken. The delivery point is in the UCAS sector. The package must arrive no later than seven o'clock tonight. Compensation for the job is 4,000 nuyen apiece. Half will be paid up front, the other half by the recipient."**
The Johnson pauses briefly to let his audience digest this information.
**"Before we continue I require your verbal agreement. Questions are, of course, welcome but I will not provide any specific details until you are committed."**

**"Very generous for a courier run. May we have information on *who* is after your package? Besides that they are dangerous enough to warrant such a payment, of course,"** Johnny says whilst eyeing the newcomer. *I'll wait till later to eye him in detail. I wouldn't wish to insult a mage of our host's caliber by doing so in front of him,* he thinks as he takes in the Ork's mundane appearance.

## Re: Parliament of Thieves

### **Valheru** (2010-07-20 02:42:21)

Mr. Johnson nods as if he had expected the question.
**"Several organizations, both governmental and private, might seek to intercept the package. I'm afraid I cannot be more specific as this juncture."**
The ork, who is sitting quietly now, appears to have the musculature typical for a member of his race. His head is bald and his arms are bare so as to better display the various tattoos that adorn him. Currently his eyes glow an eerie red, indicating they are probably cybernetic. His clothing follows the latest trends in Goblin Rock and a Steyer TMP rests in a shoulder holster.

He knew that if Johnson was offering 4000¥, there was definitely some danger with the job ... and danger meant 'hazard pay'. **"Honestly, Ōmono, we going to start talking serious, or should we just go back out and enjoy your arukōru inryō to taiki?"**

Jackson absorbs this information and interjects.
His voice is calm and smooth, he is in his 'zone'.
<< **@Frost: Amateurs** >>
“**Mr. Johnson, I believe what we are all wondering is this: will there be room for reasonable compensation? After examining this group and that’s a cursory glance of course, we are a fairly ‘heavy’ group; it’s safe to say we are not delivering groceries or a pizza to this client. As you have stated, many people have an interest in this item. We are only curious; will the recipient be willing to cover reasonable expenses? If you are not able to assist us, then ensuring that you receive quality service, may come into question. Perhaps, we start at 4,000 nuyen per person, and if need be, would it be possible to have your ‘associate’ cover our expenses up to 5,000 per person? If we encounter no troubles, then I believe 4,000 is a fair price for an expedited and discreet delivery. If we suffer losses; life, limb and personal property, then I feel that 5,000, per person is reasonable compensation, do you not agree?**”

## Re: Parliament of Thieves

### **Valheru** (2010-07-20 17:15:58)

Mr. Johnson speaks slowly and methodically with a slight southwestern twang. While there is a certain arrogance in his voice Jackson can detect no falsehoods from him. So far it seems the Johnson is vague but honest. Despite his earlier movements Mr. Johnson does not gesticulate during the conversation. Instead his arms are kept folded on top of his knees (he's sitting Indian or lotus style).
Mr. Johnson's masked face turns towards Frost.
**"Ah yes, I can see how that might be a concern. Very well, I see little harm in revealing that the package is…information. You have nothing to fear from the package itself, merely those who might wish to intercept it."**
The Johnson chuckles at Jin's outburst. His tone takes on a mocking quality.
**"Ah the impetuousness of youth. As I said, the exact nature of your potential opposition must remain confidential until you agree to the job. As for the price of your services I am *talking seriously*."**
His voice is dripping with sarcasm by the end. However, Jackson's interjection gives him pause. He appears to study the ex-Marine for a moment before responding in a much more civil tone.
**"What you suggest is reasonable but I have an alternative offer. I am willing to raise your fee to a flat 4,500¥, with no variable for encountered expenses. In addition I have several resources at my disposal which can aide you in delivering the package. You may use these resources free of charge, which is of considerable value I assure you. How does that sound?"**
((Jin and Jackson did a teamwork test. Jin rolled poorly but still aided Jackson, mostly by making him look so professional in comparison :P))

Frost listens to the counter offer and then turns to Jackson and nods his head.
***<<[@Jackson] That sounds like a good deal to me.>>***
He looks back towards the man in the Raven mask.
"Well I think you can count my friend and I in at this point. I won't presume to answer for anyone else though."
***<<[@Jackson] Raven is a joker and a trickster in most Indian cultures. I hope we are the tools of the trickster not his target]>>***

Behind the mask it's impossible to tell his facial expression but Mr. Johnson sounds pleased.
**"Excellent. And the rest of you?"**
As the Johnson looks around the room at the others the ork grins, bearing his tusks.
**"I'm game,"** he says simply.

**"My services are yours as well, honored host,"** Johnny says stepping forward and sweeping off his hat and bowing to the room. **"I am Johnathon Miguel Sanchez Vila-lobos Ramirez Marleon, mage extraordinare. You may all call me Gentleman Johnny,"** he says, over emphasizing each syllable, with a grin and a flash of showmanship before stepping back to the wall.

Jackson turns to Frost, giving him a non-verbal signal that he agrees. Jackson turns and addresses the Johnson respectfully.
“**I feel that is… reasonable.**”
Jackson briefly examines each one of the “runners” in the room. He’s looking at facial expressions and body language.

((Hmm...I think it would be best for the others to post their own body language. Jackson scored two hits so give him a little information but it's not as though he has a window into your soul.))
The ork, who has yet to identify himself, seems to be a bit bored as he waits for the others to make up their minds. From the way he zones out every so often Jackson suspects he's manipulating a neural-linked commlink.

Fade has listened to the rest and their negotiations, but has yet to say something. And now is not the time to do so anyway, so instead the assassin gives a nod to show her approval. She folds her arms over her chest, waiting for the rest to either accept or refuse the offer, waiting for the opportunity to ask further questions about the job, questions normally only asked after accepting.

Jin gives the 'whatever' look and says, **"Yeah, whatever, Ōmono … just hope our asses are covered.

It's fairly obvious that Jin wanted more info, but also knew he wasn't going to get it without agreeing to the terms.

## Re: Parliament of Thieves

### **Valheru** (2010-07-20 22:56:57)

Mr. Johnson nods slowly, **"Alright then, now that all have agreed…"**
He holds up a plain manila envelope for the group to see.
**"This, is a letter from the Koshari. It is to be delivered to the sottocapo of the Chavez family at 4923 Billings St. in the Montbello District of the UCAS sector. The exact contents of the letter shall remain confidential. If the seal is broken you will forfeit the remainder of your pay. As you may have surmised already the opposition I spoke of consists of other underworld groups as well as law enforcement. The resources I spoke of include a van if any of you need transportation or would prefer to travel in one vehicle, and two coyotes that can assist you in crossing into the UCAS should you wish. What other questions do you have?"**

“**Mr. Johnson, if I may. How will these opposing forces know that we are couriers and that we are coming unless someone has already notified them? I believe if you can keep a secret so can we. Having said that, is there any special communication we need to use to verify who we are and who they are? This is to avoid any confusion at the drop point and of course any other clever individuals who may seek to relieve us of this information. As far as tactics go, it may be our best interest for us to decide what course of action we should take before assuming full ownership of the envelope. Before we depart your company and come to any final decisions on what resources will need to access, would you humbly permit us a moment to talk in private about the matter?**”

## Re: Parliament of Thieves

### **Valheru** (2010-07-21 00:52:12)

Mr. Johnson laughs softly at Jackson's question.
"**Quite simply? They shouldn't. But news travels fast in the shadows."** He indicates the bodyguards on either side of him, **"I trust these men implicitly. Else they wouldn't be here. Unfortunately every organization of this size has leaks. I cannot say how extensive an information network our competitors have but I suspect at least some of them know the delivery is today. We can hope they do not know you specifically are the couriers, but they will be watching."**
**"As for your request for privacy, that can be arranged. I can busy myself making sure the staff hasn't forgotten how to do their jobs!"** he says with a cackle. Mr. Johnson gets up slowly and begins moving towards the door with a somewhat stiff gait. **"Just don't take too long…you're on the clock."**
((If anyone wants to ask him a question before your strategy meeting you can. Otherwise he and the bodyguards will leave the room.))

**"A moment, honored host. The incredibly clean young man voiced a concern you haven't answered. Information we need to complete the job: the 'Sottocapo of the Chavez family at 4923 Billings St. in the Montbello District of the UCAS sector' could be easily confused with the nefarious villain's Butler named Bob for all we know of the person. It would be a shame to lose the other half of our modest pay due to ignorance. I would also like to know how a dog, wild or any other variety, will help in crossing the border. I find myself quite curious about that, I do love animals so,"** Johnny asks before the Johnson leaves, a slightly disappointed look to the way he stands, and a grin on his face.

## Re: Parliament of Thieves

### **Valheru** (2010-07-21 04:56:49)

At the door Mr. Johnson turns back to Johnny and studies him for a moment. Suddenly he bursts out laughing.
**"At first I thought you were joking but now I believe you're serious. You *are* new to Denver aren't you?"**
He composes himself and explains, **"A coyote is someone who specializes in crossing borders illegally. You will find their services quite useful in Denver, though expensive. As I said earlier the Koshari will take care of the coyotes' fees if you choose to use them."**
**"I understand your other concern but allow me to explain that it is unnecessary. I suppose I should have mentioned that 4923 Billings St. is the sottocapo's home. If anyone could pull off impersonating Omar Chavez in his own home, surrounded by mafia enforcers…well this little envelope would be the least of our worries."**

After the Johnson leaves Johnny turns to the group, **"My suggestion is to split the parties.

Meanwhile you lot leave here with much fanfare and hullabaloo and make your way there by another, more open route whilst drawing plenty of attention. Sounds simply marvelous, don't you agree?"**
Once done with his pitch he draws another of the natural cigarettes and murmurs mostly to himself, **"I wonder if they would throw in a bottle of that Scotch on successful completion?"** as he eyes the bottom of his glass.
**"Either way, we must decide soon. The sands of time wait for no mundane being, and only some magicians. And Time and I aren't on speaking terms currently."**

Frost doesn't let the sarcasm in his voice become insulting he keeps it sounding friendly.
**"I think we should all stick together and do a quick inventory of our assets since we are forced to work with strangers for the most part. My name is Frost this is Jackson."**
He points to the man sitting next to him.
**"I specialize in tactics and close combat. I have a Suzuki Mirage outside and I'm armed with only pistols at the moment. I like Combat Bike and teammates who can pull their weight. Oh yea and I'm an Leo. Jackson would you care to tell them what you do?"**

“**I’m an experienced combat field medic. My job is to keep runners alive and make sure they get paid. I’m the life saver and the heart breaker.

In particular she gives one of her colder looks to the mage who appears to have called her a Silicon Maid. Then finally she opens her mouth to speak. She speaks slowly, as if she's not fully familiar with the language, yet there's only little accent.
*"The name is Fade, I am a dealer of death,"* she then simply states, waiting for the reactions, if any, from the rest of the group, ready to move and fight at the first sign of trouble.

He says with genuine sincerity.

I suggest we stay off main highways and thru ways. Everyone have up to date navsofts? We meet up with Johnson's coyotes and have them take us across to avoid being spotted at checkpoints and followed. Everyone update each others commlinks with you code. Reth can you set us up with a quick secure tacnet? Johnnny can you summon a spirit or a watcher for astral security? Anyone think of anything I missed or anything to add?"**

He connects his PAN to Frost's and any other team member who provides their commcode. Once linked an AR window pops up that displays each member's location.

As for the route we don't know where we are going yet. Jackson or Reth contact the coyote and find out where they want to meet.

Jackson follows Frost’s cue; he walks to the door and pokes his head out of the room making contact with one of the Johnson’s bodyguards.
“**Excuse me, sir, please let Mr. Johnson know, we are ready to conclude our business here. Inform him if you will, that we need to gather some information and resources before going on our way**.”

### **Valheru** (2010-07-26 02:15:40)

The guard is waiting a discreet distance from the door. At Jackson's request the man simply nods and moves off in the direction of Mr. Johnson. The Johnson is seated at the bar enjoying a drink and giving the bartender a hard time. When the guard whispers in his ear Mr. Johnson finishes his drink and sets his glass on the counter.
Mr. Johnson enters the back room with his bodyguards a step behind him.
**"So,"** he says pleasantly, **"I hear you're ready. What can I assist you with?"**

Frost looks at the Johnson in the Raven mask.
**"Looks like we will need to use that van and those coyote contacts. We will be ready to leave as soon as the van is ready. Well there is the small matter of your half of the payment. I can't speak for the others but a simple account transfer will suffice for me."**
He turns and looks towards the team giving them the floor for any questions or payment options.

**"Of course,"** Mr. Johnson says simply. He hands Frost the package then withdraws a commlink from the folds of his ceremonial garb. He transfers 2250 nuyen to all members of the team that have their commlink ready. The passcode for the van and the coyotes' commcodes are also sent to the team.
((If you would prefer a certified credstick over an account transfer you may ask for one now.))

Once complete, he double checked his gear and said, **"Can't think of a thing, Ōotoko."** Turning to Frost, he grinned and said, **"Okay, Nē, let's do this thing."**

Then after some time she finally speaks, *"I assume that I too will have to place my vehicle in the back of this van, am I correct? Can I receive further information about the van? Are there windows, is it bulletproof, how easily defendable is it against attacks?

Jin and Reth in front on their bikes me and Johnny in the middle in the van and Jackson and yourself riding behind the van. As far as how defend-able it is I'm not sure we haven't seen it yet. My guess is it is probably just a normal cargo style van not some armored out death wagon. Jin and yourself seem the most combat heavy of the bunch, No offense Reth, so I wanted one of you in front and one in the back. I don't care who goes where if you guys wanna switch it cool by me.

Reth hops on his bike and revs the engine. An excited grin lights up his face and he laughs at Jin's ancient pop culture references. It seems he's able to catch most of the man's Japanese.
**"Let's ride!"** he says in agreement.
**"Oh Jackson, you want to call the coyote or should I? It might be a good idea to know where we're heading."**
**<<@Frost/Jackson: Slitches, what can you expect?>>**
==============================================================
Inside the van Johnny begins summoning. An apparition appears before him, resembling a miniature butler complete with monocle.
"What is it now, master magician?" the obviously annoyed Wadsworth asks.
Shortly thereafter a second spirit appears, looking much like the first.
"Wadsworth! You're being rude. Show the master some respect!" Wellington chides.
"I don't care who he is! He has no right to just snatch us out of the astral without even so much as a by-your-leave."
"Why I'm appalled at your behavior. You should-"
"¿Qué es todo este alboroto?" the third spirit, Hernando, interrupts as it materializes.
"Well, let me tell you…"
Johnny has his spirits though he's starting to develop a headache. Whether it's from the effort required in summoning or just the spirits' chattering is hard to say.

**"Hope your ready Johnny boy."**

The vans engine purrs to life and Frost feels the power flow through all his systems. He does a sensor sweep testing the limits of the van's sensor.

Jackson takes notices of the all riders on Mirages. ‘**Like I said, it’s a popular bike**’ he thinks to himself. He assists Frost getting his bike into the van. After the bike is loaded into the van, he gives him an affirmative nod and then looks back at Fade as he straddles his bike; he gives her an affirming nod.

Wadsworth gives a petulant "hmmfpt" and disappears in a huff. However, Johnny can sense the spirit is carrying out his orders.
"Excellent sir, and yourself? I do apologize for Wadsworth behavior, I can't imagine what has gotten into him…" Wellington's voice slowly fades from existence as he dematerializes to keep watch from the astral.

The silicon maid as some called her kept quiet, simply letting her gaze follow her team mates for this job. She was quite a bit out of her usual turf, since she's used to being told who to kill and then she simply does so, the footwork handled by others. Fortunately for her it seems that others here are more used to handle all the details by themselves. She does join in on the team channel, though she remains quiet, she has no real need to spill her life story to these people.
So as the others starts moving, so does she. She quietly and quickly gets on her bike, yet another Suzuki Mirage, obviously one of many parked outside Club Denim. She starts it manually, not possessing much trust in the technology behind the built-in pilot. Also those who are familiar with the Matrix, who gives her a few pokes just for fun, will find that they need to put some effort into getting through the custom designed firewall.
Finally after what might seem like a long time to some, but not long for Fade, she finally speaks over the team channel to the others. The voice of her avatar is not much different from her actual voice, still as monotone and non-emotional as ever. And what she says simply prove that she's not one to waste words for no reason.

Reth laughs, **"Well with that attitude you probably will. Still, I know what you mean. Most runners don't have to worry about a retirement plan."**
Not to be out done he races off after Jin, though the two soon slow down for the van to catch up.
==============================================================
During the drive begins a data search. After a few minutes he is able to discover the following.
The Koshari are a sect of the traditional Zuni and Hopi Kachina society. They tend to specialize in less than legal dealings. The Koshari control most of the chip and narcotic sales in the Pueblo sector. The Denver subgroup is run by a tribal council, all of whom go by totemic names.
On the sottocapo he finds frustratingly little. However, he does find that the Chavez family is one of two major mafia players in the city. The other is the Casquilho family.
==============================================================
The trip passes uneventfully and the team arrives at Sloan Lake Park. The park is a pleasant public recreational area with a natural, untouched look to it. An Amerind man sitting in a beat up truck appears to be waiting. As the team pulls up he steps out of the truck with a scowl on his face.
**"Jackson?"** he asks.
The man appears to be in early middle-age. He wears a simple lined coat that appears well made but a little on the worn side. He does not make any effort to conceal the katana on his back or the Ares Predator at his side.

He mutters, barely audible, **“Or that you’re all a bunch of kids.”**

The spirits obey though Wadsworth is still being testy.
Johnny extends his senses into the astral and studies Reth. The ork is mundane and appears to be in good health. He is heavily cybered though it is mostly headware. Reth is currently in a relaxed state with no particularly strong emotions.
Then Johnny trains his gaze on Stalker. An impressive, or disturbing, depending on your perspective, amount of chrome has been jammed into the coyote’s body. Stalker is a heavy smoker but thanks to modern medicine is still in good health for a middle-aged man. He is annoyed, though perhaps not as much as he pretends to be.

Reth chuckles at Jackson’s speech.
**<<@Team: Sounds like you’ve had some practice Jackson. You got a day job as a flight attendant?>>**
==============================================================
Stalker starts his truck and leads the team through the park. The convoy reaches the entrance to a large tunnel that leads underground. It’s unclear what the original purpose of the tunnel was and it soon gives way to a seemingly natural passage. The tight space and uneven ground make for slow going but fortunately the vehicles can handle the rough terrain. Fungus lines the rock walls giving off a musty scent. The faint drip of water is the only sound other than the low roar of the engines.
Abruptly the course cavern turns into smooth concrete. Stalker threads through a maze of passageways marked with Aztec style artwork.
**<<These tunnels were built by the Aztlan Sector government before they got kicked out. Some holdouts still live down here but they won’t give us any trouble.>>**
His truck stops suddenly and goes silent.

He adjusts his lenses to process ambient light for better visuals. He perks up his ear buds to max, listening for vehicles or footsteps not a part of his caravan. He keeps a close watch behind him.

As the order to shut off the engines was given, Fade shuts off her bike. Quickly she casts a look around, switching to thermographic vision as she checks for any heat sources, while at the same time the protective covers makes her eyes all metallic, to protect her against sudden bursts of light/heat sources. As she does this her spurs start extracting themselves and she does a quick check to make sure she can call forth her Ingram from her hidden sleeve, while mentally engaging the smartlink system in the semi-automatic machine gun. She also mentally switches to receiving oxygen from her internal air tank, since you can never know if anyone is trying to use some airborne poisons.

At first no one hears a thing. It's as if the stifling air smothers all sound as well. After a few tense moments of silence a scrabbling noise becomes audible. It sounds like clawed feet clambering over broken pavement. All at once a pack of ghouls bursts from the surrounding tunnels. Four ghouls are in front of the convoy, two are on one side, and a single ghoul is on the opposite side. They stare at the group with blind eyes as drool begins to run down their mouths. An inhuman screech rips from their throats in a deafening cacophony and the ghouls begin to charge.
((Initiative

Just distract them as best you can,* he tells them telepathically as he struggles with the window of the van. Once he figures out how to lower it, he pulls his glasses down and looks to the closest pair of ghouls. He waits, hoping to time it perfectly, and when one steps clear of Reth lightning bolts streak from his eyes towards the gibbering ghoul...

"Great, just what I needed," Fade mutters in her native tongue of Japanese. Before she finishes this sentence her Ingram Smartgun is in her hand coming from her hidden gun slide up her sleeve. As her gun is in her hand the smartgun system is activated and the target indicator pops up in her HUD. With her inhuman reflexes, courtesy of her cyber-enhancements, she quickly targets the closest ghoul and as she leaps off her bike and starts moving towards the one she's opening fire against.

Fade leaps off her bike and unleashes a quick burst at one of the oncoming ghouls. The bullets tear through the ghoul's skull and eject flecks of brain matter; dropping the creature in a heap.
((Short narrow burst: Firearms 4 + Agility 8 + Smartgun 2 - 1 uncompensated recoil = 14. 7 hits! Ghoul gets 2 hits to dodge. Damage: 5 base + 2 Burst + 5 Net Hits = 12 Physical. Damage Resistance Test: 0 hits!))

Reacting with chrome enhanced speed Fade twists at just the right moment and the ghoul's claws narrowly miss her.
Jackson's eyes grow wide as a ghoul's claws swing towards his throat. He tries to dodge but somehow he knows he just isn't fast enough. At the last fraction of a second the ghoul stumbles on a patch of broken pavement and the its attack goes wide.

Jin swings his Black Blade of the Demon at the ghoul that charged him. Unfortunately the ghoul jumps out the way at just the right moment and Jin misses.
Johnny struggles with the window but manages to open it. He flings a lightning bolt at the ghoul on Reth. The blast catches the creature full on and chars the flesh. Combined with the sucking chest wounds its already suffering the ghoul collapses as spasm wrack its unconscious form.

Jackson fires at the ghoul that rushed him but is unable to hit.

After dropping the first ghoul, the assassin lands in a crouch, only to get up and start moving towards the nearest. As she does she quickly finds the next target, releasing another burst of bullets at the ghoul that is now nearest to her. She tries to stay aware of her surroundings at all times, prepared to dodge any ghouls trying to engage her in melee.

Fade tries to maneuver her Ingram around and pump the ghoul attacking her full of lead. Unfortunately the creature manages to push her gun out of the way and the bullets pound uselessly into the pavement.
((Agility 8 + Firearms 4 + Smartlink 2 - 3 for being in melee = 11, 2 hits. Ghoul Reaction ?, 3 hits.))
Stalker snarls in anger and pain at the scratch on his arm. He brings his katana down in a vicious slash at the offending ghoul's torso. However the ghoul's thick hide proves difficult to penetrate and instead of slicing the beast in two he merely creates a nasty gash from shoulder to hip.
((5 Physical damage to the previously wounded Ghoul))
Reth jerks back in surprise as a lightning bolt flashes by his face but recovers swiftly. Moving with obviously enhanced speed the ork rushes forward to get a clear line of fire on the ghouls attacking Stalker. He unleashes a torrent of bullets at both ghouls. The first, intent on Stalker and slowed by its already grievous wounds doesn't even stand a chance. The hail of fire rips the ghoul apart leaving little more than a gory mess on the pavement. The second ghoul manages to duck and narrowly avoids the spray which has climbed ever higher from the recoil.
((9 damage))
Frost takes aim at the ghoul menacing his old buddy and lets loose with a vengeance. The Ruger Thunderbolt lives up to its namesake and roars in his hand as it spews bullets. The ghoul is so focused on the tasty meal in front of it that it barely even registers the danger. Bullets pound into the monster's back and it goes down in a spray of fine red mist.
((1st burst: Agility 7 + Pistols 5 + Smartlink 2 = 14, 5 hits. Ghoul Reaction ? - 3 for being in melee, 1 hit.
Damage: 5 Base + 2 Burst + 4 Net Hits = 11. Ghoul Body ?, 2 hits. Net Damage = 9!

Damage: 5 Base +2 Burst + 3 Net Hits = 10. Ghoul Body ?, 4 Hits. Net Damage = 6, Total Damage = 15!))
Jin focuses his rage on the ghoul attacking him and lashes out. This time his blade finds flesh to sink its teeth into but the ghouls scabrous skin is resilient. The twisted humanoid hisses in pain but its wound is relatively minor.
((Agility 4 + Blades 4 + 1 Reach = 8, 3 hits. Ghoul Reaction ? + Unarmed Combat ? - 1 for second Defense, 2 hits. Damage: Base 5 + 1 Net Hit = 6. Ghoul Body ?, 4 hits. Net Damage = 2))
Out of thin air three small spectral butlers appear. The spirits streak towards the remaining ghouls and begin doing their best to distract the monsters. The ghouls snap at the irritating pests but a quick sniff reveals them to be inedible so the ghouls focus on the physical opponents as best they can.
((Don't see anything in the rules to cover this but I think it's a clever idea so I'll give the ghouls a -1 penalty.))
((Summary: 4 Ghouls Down, 1 Uninjured Ghoul on Stalker, 1 Uninjured Ghoul on Fade, 1 Injured Ghoul on Jin (2 Physical Damage)

Frost doesn't break stride as he moves over to Jackson. His smartlink locks onto the Ghoul facing off against Stalker. <<[MOTO] Designet target 2>>He waits for a nano-second then squezzes the trigger. Without waiting to see the effect, confident in his abilities the turns towards Jin and locks onto his Ghoul <<[MOTO] Designate target 3>>and pauses for another nano-second letting his reticue pause long enough to turn red then he fires again. His smartlink pops up in an AR window telling him he is out of ammo.
<<1st burst vs Stalker's Ghoul: Agility 7 + Pistols 5 + Smartlink 2 = 14>>

Fade evades the incoming ghoul, by far being its superior when it comes to reflexes. There's some advantage to being more metal than flesh after all. She follows her evasion up with a quick knee in the gut and then uppercut with her spurs, trying to put them through the skull of the infected critter.

Spurs erupt from Fade's hand with that distinctive snikt as her first rams into the ghoul's jaw. The blades thrust up through the monster's skull yet impossibly it is still alive. The ghoul shutters from the impact and collapses, snarling weakly at her.
((Agility 8 + Spurs 2 = 10, 6 hits! Ghoul's Reaction ? + Unarmed Combat ? - 1 for second defense - 1 distracted, 2 hits. Damage: 7 base + 4 Net Hits = 11. Ghoul's Body ?, 0 hits! Net Damage = 11 Physical!))
Stalker whips his katana back towards the second ghoul and focuses his strength to cut through the creature's tough hide. The blade slices into its target and knocks it down, drawing forth a howl of pain.
((8 Physical Damage))
Reth unleashes two more bursts, first at the ghoul on Fade and then at the ghoul attacking stalker. Once again the first burst tears apart its target while the second misses.
((12 Physical Damage))
Frost calmly fires at his first target. The ghoul's head bursts like a melon and Frost is already tracking to the next target. He pauses for just an instant to draw a bead on the ghoul. Frost pulls the trigger when the perfect opportunity arises as Jin draws back for a lunge. The bullets thud into the beat's chest, dropping it to the ground, but it still draws breath.
((Agility 7 + Pistols 5 + Smartlink 2 = 14, 10 hits! Ghoul's Reaction ? - 2 Wound Penalty - 1 second defense - 1 distracted, 1 hit. Damage: 5 Base + 2 Burst + 9 Net Hits = 16. Ghoul's Body ?, 3 hits. Net damage = 13!

Jin is about to lunge when the ghoul collapses at his feet. Without missing a beat the adept reverses his sword grip and plunges the blade straight into the creature's heart. It gives a final shutter before growing permanently still.
((Agility 4 + Blades 4 + Reach 1 = 9, 2 hits. Ghoul's Reaction ? + Unarmed Combat ? - 3 forth defense - 3 Wound Penalty - 2 Prone - 1 Distraction, 0 hits. Damage: 5 base + 2 Net Hits = 7. Ghoul's Body ?, 3 hits. Net damage = 4))

Stalker remains stoic during Jackson's examination. Jackson realizes the wound is not that worrisome, a few stitches and a bandage will fix Stalker right up. Unfortunately Jackson suddenly realizes he doesn't have any medical supplies. Stalker notices the hesitation and produces his Medkit with a sardonic smile. Jackson goes to work and soon as Stalker as good as new. The coyote inspects Jackson's work before testing to see how his arm feels. He gives a satisfied nod.
"Thank you, nice work," he says aloud.
Stalker glances around at the rest of the group as he heads to his truck.
**<<@Team: Come on, let's roll out.>>**
**<<@Frost: I've been making this run for some time now. I've fought off ghouls before but never with this many clients. These ghouls all seemed to be zombie-brained though.>>**
((First Aid 5 + Intuition 3 - 2 Poor Conditions + 1 Assistant + 1 Medkit= 8, 5 hits. Stalker recovers all 3 boxes of damage.))
==============================================================
Stalker starts on down the tunnels. After only five more minutes the group exits the tunnels into another park area. In contrast to Sloan Lake Park this place is very, very green. Unnaturally so in the dry Denver climate, the park must go through an inordinate amount of water. The vegetation is well manicured and paved paths snake through the park.
Stalker stops once everyone is clear of the tunnel.

Nodding, Jin mounted the bike and said **"Eieikyaputen…"** before gunning the vehicle and racing into the lead.
***<@Team: Anyone know any good traveling tunes to keep us busy?>***
Even over the comm, it was pretty obvious that Jin was joking, hoping that levity would release some of the tension between everyone. He knew that while they were on the job, he'd do what he could to fulfill his end of the contract.

**"Oh, the usual. I was disowned and pronounced dead by my multi-trillionaire family. They didn't appreciate my… discriminating tastes,"** Johnny says as he opens his third eye, looking for a source for all the green in the park.
**"I don't think the scandal involving an Ork prostitute, three disreputable dwarves, and the daughter of one of my father’s strongest corporate allies helped matters all that much. Not after my Master exiled me from his home for bedding his wife and daughter, not to mention most of his staff, anyway. Knowing what I do know, I'm thankful he just threw me out.

As the last ghoul drops, the asian assassin fires another burst of bullets into its skull, 'just to make sure'. With much efficiency, making it obvious that it is not the first time she has used her spurs to kill something or someone, Fade cleans her spurs of ghoul goo, before they slide back into her hands, hidden away from curious eyes once more. Another few seconds and her SMG has been reloaded with yet another clip, the half-empty clip going into her pocket for a refill at a later time. And then that weapon is gone from view too, as it is returned to the hidden slide, ready for the next fight.
She looks at the rest of her team, spending a couple of replaying their actions mentally, before she finally speaks.

Reth begins dutifully plotting a course for the team. Before long he sends rough directions over the tacnet.
At Jin's request, even though it is a joke, Reth grins.
**"Here ya go omae."**
He blares some obnoxious heavy metal ork rock over a secondary channel that any of the team can access on their commlinks.
==============================================================
Jackson calls Peaches, who answers promptly. The image of a middle-aged ork woman with fiery orange hair appears in an A.R. window.
**"This is Peaches. Whut can I do fo yea?"**
She speaks with a thick Deep South accent and smiles politely.
==============================================================
Just as the group is about to head out Wadsworth contacts Johnny through their telepathic link. The irritable watcher intones in a flat voice,
**"I would be remiss if I neglected to inform you there is an angry spirit up ahead. Perhaps you should avoid it…sir."**

**"An angry spirit you say? Any kin of yours, dear Wadsworth? Why is it angry, hmmmm? How far ahead is it? Why is it angry with me? Have you been talking about me again Wadsworth? Well?! Have you informed your colleagues? Out with it man!"** Johnny replies after getting Frost's attention with a gesture.
*Wellington, Hernando, your third has reported a large angry spirit ahead of us, if you would be so kind as to assist?* He thinks to the watchers as he questions Wadsworth. While waiting for his response he remarks to Frost, **"We may have trouble. You may wish to route us around. We'll know more shortly."** Johnny then folds his hands over the head of his cane and leans forward intent on Wadsworth.

### **Valheru** (2010-08-28 17:34:42)

**"Yes. No. I don't know, would you like me to ask it? Not far. I don't think it's specifically angry at you, unless…did you botch any summons lately? No. No."**
Johnny senses smug satisfaction coming off the annoying little spirit in waves.
Wellington and Hernando join Wadsworth almost instantly.
**"Oh do get over yourself Wadsworth. You're stuck here for another 45 minutes so you might as well make the best-"**
The prim little watcher cuts off as he comes within assenssing range of the angry spirit.
**"Oh my yes. Master, it is a spirit of man that appears to be haunting the place. It hasn't noticed us yet, mostly just wandering around moaning and doing, well, ghostly things. If you exit the park by some other route I imagine you could avoid it all together."**

He thought back to his time in Chicago and dealing with toxic spirits and Insect shamans. He had seen plenty of magical carnage in his time in the Marines. He knew this was Johnny's area of expertise and was prepared to follow his advice.

Johnny turns to Frost, **"Haven't you been listening? There's a spirit ahead, rather pissy one too. Apparently it is simply haunting the place. If there is no alternate route I may be able to handle it, but I'd rather not if it's all the same,"** he tells him, waiting to hear what else Wadsworth and Wellington have to say before sending them back to there duties.

He really didn't want to engage a spirit especially on its own turf, plus it would just slow them down. He looks the route over and is satisfied that they wouldn't lose to much time. Frost quickly relays the route to his team.
<<@Team: Here is an updated route out of Cheeseman. If no one objects we will detour around the ghost. *File attached*>>
"Johnny are you the only magical asset we have? I know Jackson isn't unless you count his ability to talk women out of their clothes. I am pretty sure Fade and Reth aren't due to the amount of chrome they have. So I guess I'm really just asking about Jin."

Jackson replies in a fresh voice, using a vid transmission.
“**Evening, Peaches, My name is Jackson. A ‘mutual friend’ we have in common said you’d be able to assist my associates and I cross from the CAS into the UCAS. I'd like to know if you are you available and how soon you could meet us?** ”
Jackson flashes a friendly, professional smile.

The team manages to exit the park and avoid any ghostly encounters. Unfortunately, despite Reth's best efforts to find the route less traveled, traffic is starting to get heavy. It seems very few roads aren't busy during Denver's rush hour.
==============================================================
Peaches smile widens in response to Jackson.
**"And good evenin' to you, Mista Jackson. It would be my pleasure to assist such a handsome gentleman as yourself. Howeva I'm afraid I must ascertain the identity of this 'mutual friend'. Yea see my services have already been…requested for this evenin'."**
Her smile fades, as if she would truly regret not being able to help.

He takes a moment to check in with the spirits, before asking, with a tiny amount of whine, **"Are we there yet? By the gods this is the longest trip I've been on since leaving New York.

He waits for the lead bikes to make the proper course corrections and follows behind weaving through the growing traffic. He glances over and checks on Johnny.

Frost rest his elbow out the window and opens an AR window pulling up a local traffic feed trying to figure whats slowing everything down.

### **Valheru** (2010-09-12 19:35:50)

The caravan sets out on the new course provided by Frost. This seems to be a busy commercial area of the CAS Sector. Numerous bars, restaurants, and stores are visible along the way. Traffic begins to get heavier and heavier until finally the van is forced to come to almost a complete stop. The music of the sprawl fills the air: horns bleeting, engines rumbling, and the incoherent blend of voices spewing from the masses of metahumanity. Welcome to the Denver rush hour.
Frost rolls down the window and begins trying to find a less congested route. After all time is still ticking down and they are only half way to the next rendezvous. Suddenly a flash of black in the side view mirror catches his attention. A Mitsubishi Nightsky pulls out of a side street close to the van. The back doors open simultaneously and four Asian men exit the limo. The four humans are wearing tres chic suits and sunglasses, despite the fact that it's not that bright out. They begin walking directly towards the van.
Up the street, at almost the same moment, the door to The Pearl Buffet opens. Four Asians - a human
woman, an ork woman, a male troll, and a human male sporting a long goatee - exit the restaurant. They also begin walking towards the van. It appears the two groups will reach the van within seconds of each other.
As soon as the two groups appear Johnny's spirits pipe up.
"That troll is a magician Master Marleon," Wellington informs.
"Este-" Hernando pauses before switching to heavily accented English, "This one es an Adept señor." The watcher flies towards the lead Asian emerging from the limo.

Members of both groups notice Jackson draw his weapon and respond in kind. The leaders of each group, who do not have weapons drawn, raise their hands in the near universal signal for 'stop'. After several tense moments with no shots being fired the groups resume marching towards the van. It's obvious to anyone who looks that the two groups are watching each other as closely as they watch Jackson and the van.
Finally all eight of them arrive at the van. Three from each group hang back eyeing each other while the leaders jostle for position at Frost's open window. The well-dressed human sneers at his counterpart, which requires more balls than brains when said counterpart is a troll, before turning his attention to Frost.
**"I will make this short. I am Jonny Ono and I represent someone who is very interested in acquiring the package you carry. Hand it over to me and we can all go about our business. I will of course compensate you for your trouble."**
He is soft-spoken and speaks with a mild Japanese accent. It seems Ono is about to say more when the troll interrupts.
**"I am An Peng and I represent others interested in the package,"** he snarls with no trace of an accent.
**"You will give the package to me for the generous sum of 3,500 nuyen."**
Ono clearly does not like to be interrupted and if looks could kill Peng would be a corpse right now.
**"I will match his offer,"** he says through gritted teeth.
==============================================================
Johnny's spirits fan out as he focuses his astral sight upon the two Awakened men. Studying the troll first Johnny is able to determine An Peng is healthy, impatient, and appears to lack any cyberware. Gazing at Jonny Ono reveals precious little information as well. The adept is hale, full of disdain, and also free of cyberware.
((No love from the dice I'm afraid, only two hits on each. Also, as near as I can tell Assensing falls under the purview of Observe in Detail and thus takes a simple action. Therefore Johnny can't call on his bound spirit just yet.))

The goons relax, slightly, when Jackson puts his weapon away. However, neither side is willing to holster first so they begin staring each other down.
Peng and Ono watch Johnny's antics with a hint of confusion before returning their gaze to Frost.
The troll slams his fist on the van door, denting it slightly.
**"No stalling!"** Peng shouts.
The suited Asians point their weapons at the troll and even Jonny Ono displays a moment's hesitation. An Peng draws a deep breath and exhales gutturally, calming slightly since his outburst nearly drew fire from his competitors. The impatient troll repeats his demand.
**"I have offered you a fair price now hand over the package so I can be done with you!"**
Jonny Ono opens his mouth to say something when one of his underlings catches his attention. Ono swirls to face the interruption with a snarl on his lips. Undeterred, though perhaps inwardly terrified, the minion explains himself.
**"Jōshi wa, kanojo no kotode wa nai?"**
Ono's expression immediately becomes thoughtful when his head shifts towards Fade. He turns back to Frost with a smile.
**"The deal has changed. You can keep the package, or give it to Peng, I don't care. Just leave the girl for us," he indicates Fade just so there is no confusion, "and my boys and I will leave you to your business."**

Meanwhile Johnny concentrates on the troll and his sensitive parts.

However Peng, having seen Fluffy appear first in astral space, is ready for the ‘attack’. At the same moment he lifts up his hand and a great gout of fire rushes past Frost’s face to hit Johnny square in the chest! Amazingly Johnny’s magical defenses combined with his trusty Mortimer Greatcoat reduce the blast to almost nothing and he easily pats out the smattering of flames that remain. After the attack Peng lets loose a grunt from the effort that morphs into an “Oh” of shocked pleasure. Looking down he sees a growing wet spot around his crouch.

Jackson receives the message loud and clear. He sticks his hand under his coat and un-holsters the Colt 2066. He takes aim on the poor unfortunate An Peng.
‘No hard feelings, chummer. The sarge says you gotta die, well then, you gotta die.’ He thinks to himself.

Fade dismounts and crouches behind her bike in a blur a motion. Before her shoes even hit the pavement the Ingram Smartgun X has slid out into her hand. As soon as her feet are set she releases two quick bursts that rip into one of the suited Asians. With a half dozen holes in his chest the target drops.
**((Draw Ingram with gun slide as Free Action

Fluffy lunges at Jonny Ono with its razor sharp teeth but the adept's supernatural abilities enable him to avoid the attack. The beast spirit snarls in frustration.
**((Bite as Complex Action: Unarmed Combat 5 + Agility 6 = 11, 3 hits. Ono Defends: Reaction ? + Unarmed ? = 4 hits.))**
Jonny Ono sneers at the beast spirit in contempt. With a quick draw that would be the envy of even the best Old West cowboy he draws both of the Ares Sliverguns from under his jacket and fires in one smooth motion. Bursts of shrapnel tear into Fluffy's hide leaving gaping wounds. The creature, unused to such grievous injuries on the physical plane, drops to the ground and let's out a shocked cry of pain. On the other hand Jonny Ono seems equally surprised to find his target still alive.
**((Quick Draw and Fire Narrow Burst: Firearms + Reaction (3), success. Firearms ? + Agility ? + Smartlink 2 - 3 Attacker in Melee - 2 Recoil = 3 hits. Fluffy Defends: Reaction 7, 1 hit. Fluffy resists DV 12: Body 7 + Armor 10 + AP 2 = 19, 10 hits, Fluffy suffers 2 Physical Damage.

Frost triggers the gun slide and his Ruger Thunderbolt appears in his hand almost instantly. He snaps off a burst at the troll magician but by sheer dumb luck An Peng jerks out of the way at the last second. The bullets smash through the storefront window behind Peng but the gel rounds shouldn't cause any life-threatening injuries to the shoppers. Peng's luck seems to run out as the next volley strikes him
**((1st Burst: Agility 7 + Pistols 7 + Smartlink 2 - 1 Attacker in Melee = 14, 3 hits. Peng Defends: Reaction ? + Edge ? - 1 Orgasm = 5 hits.

Reth hops off his bike and drops behind it for cover. The orc draws his Steyr TMP and unleashes a hail of bullets at the only target he has a good angle on. The burst catches the human male accompanying An Peng and the man goes down with a gurgling thud.
**((Draw TMP as Simple Action

Peng's accomplices focus their fire on Frost after watching him nearly knock out their leader. The two unleash a hail of bullets into the vehicle (and into some of the surrounding vehicles with their lousy aim) but Frost wisely ducks down behind the door and the bullets sail over his head, past Johnny's face, and out the opposite window.

Ono's suited thugs are content to let their boss deal with the beast spirit. Instead they attempt to bring down Fade due to their obvious interest in her. The pair fire short bursts from their Ceska Black Scorpions but only one manages to wound the agile street samurai.

**"And you call yourself a practitioner?"** Johnny's voice climbs with in pitch equal to his outrage at the Troll's poor performance.
As Ono shoots Fluffy his voice reaches an almost glass shattering pitch as he screams, **"FLUFFY!!!"**
After Peng's thugs fill the van with holes Johnny finds he's had enough. He begins to mumble under his breath, but in contrast to his earlier outbursts it isn't high pitched and ear hurting- its so deep it forms an ache in the chest. His voice rises, taking the form of a chant, deepening with every repetition until he sounds inhuman, like some beast from the very depths of hell. The entire time words can be picked out his chant in dozens of different languages, but each word is easily translated to English: Burn. He grasps the grip of his pistol with one hand and snaps the fingers of the other. With the snap a bright white, almost clear sphere of heat blossoms behind the thugs and grows with disturbing speed shifting through the color scheme as it looses heat. First it is white, the fading to blue, then light to dark orange, and finally to the myriad reds that make up the weakest flames...

Jin draws his sword as he leaps off the Suzuki Mirage. However the adept thinks better of charging into the fray and stops behind one of the myriad vehicles stuck in traffic. He rapidly draws the Colt Manhunter at his side and snaps off a shot from the hip at one of the thugs. The target tries to dodge but trips; ending up on the ground with a bullet in his arm for his trouble.
**((Draw Sword as Simple Action

Jackson loses sight of his intended target when the big troll drops to the ground. Cursing under his breath he quickly switches targets and fires at the closest member of Jonny Ono's gang. Unfortunately the crowded street makes things difficult and Jackson's shot glances off the back of the van.
**((Agility 5 + Pistols 3 + Smartlink 2 = 10, 2 hits. Y2 Defends: Reaction ? + Cover 2 = 3 hits.))**
Johnny dismisses the spell on Peng to focus his full attention on his next spell. With a snap of his fingers the Chaos Mage creates a ball of fire that shoots out of the van and explodes along the sidewalk, setting fire to the shops unfortunate enough to be located in the vicinity.
Ono tumbles away from the blast with uncanny speed but even he isn't quick enough to avoid the conflagration. However as the flames overtake him they sputter out and die, leaving Jonny Ono miraculously unharmed. His companion, however, is not so fortunate. The blast slams him to ground and scorches him horribly. The man lies screaming in agony as the flames continue to burn.
An Peng tries to roll out of the way but still has the wind knocked out of him from the gel rounds. While his own magical abilities manage to protect him some the fireball still sets his jacket on fire and elicits a cry of injured rage. The troll is one tough son of a bitch however and still has a lot of fight left in him. The human woman behind Peng shrieks in horror as the inferno ignites around her and knocks her to the ground. The prone ork woman is unable to get out of the way of the blast and clearly didn't survive it.
Johnny's head swims from the effort of channeling so much mana and a copious amount of blood begins running from his nose.

Fade hops over her bike and closes some of the distance between her and the van. Taking cover behind a car she leans out and fires at the uninjured Yakuza enforcer. The razorgirl's lethal aim is more than a match for the man's armored suit and he goes down in a spray of blood. Fade squeezes the trigger for another burst, this time directed at Jonny Ono. However between the rising recoil of the weapon and the adept's enhanced reaction time she is unable to hit her second target.
**((Fire Narrow Burst at Y2 as Simple Action: Firearms 4 + Agility 8 + Smartlink 2 - 2 Attacker firing from cover = 12, 6 hits. Y2 Defends: Reaction ? + Cover 2 = 1 hit. Y2 resists DV 12: Body ? + Armor ? = 1 hit, Y2 suffers 11 Physical Damage and dies.

Fluffy snaps at Jonny Ono's ankle from the ground but he nimbly avoids the weakened beast's attack. With a whimper of pain the spirit remembers Johnny's instructions to avoid injury and slips back into the astral plane.
**((Fluffy bites as a Complex Action: Agility 6 + Unarmed 5 - 3 Wound - 2 Prone = 6, 3 hits. Ono Defends: Reaction ? + Unarmed ? - 2 Third Defense = 4 hits.

Now that the annoying beast spirit appears to have left Jonny is free to focus his attention on Fade. While a proud smirk seems permanently etched into his face the adept's expression somehow manages to become even more arrogant.
**"Maede, mōichido anata no kao o shimeshite iru koto wa arimasen."**
Jonny laughs as he squeezes the triggers of his sliverguns. Time seems to slow as the flechette bursts forth, progressing inexorably towards the young street samurai. Fade tries to duck back behind the car but is too slow. The first salvo impacts with her armored abdomen making her knees buckle while the second strikes her head. Her full-body suite was worth every nuyen though and holds strong against the shrapnel. Fade collapses into blissful unconscious rather than the cold arms of death.
Ono grins in triumph and rushes over to the downed woman.

Reth spies the troll magician seeking cover and chases after him, abandoning his own defensive position. Weaving between the amassed vehicles slows him down however and he unleashes a barrage of bullets before quite reaching the troll. Peng ducks behind a car and the deadly spray tears into the trunk, thankfully avoiding the panicked driver.
**((Narrow Full Burst as Complex Action: Agility ? + Pistols ? + 2 Smartlink - 3 Recoil = 2 hits. Peng Defends: Reaction ? + Cover 4 = 3 hits.))**
Jin charges forward and skewers the burning human woman. She is in such agony that she barely even attempts to avoid the strike and Jin's blade slides through her unarmored throat. All things considered it may be an act of mercy as her shrill screams finally fade.
**((Agility 4 + Blades 4 + 2 Charge + 3 Opponent Prone + 1 Reach= 14, 4 hits. T1 Defends: Reaction ? + Unarmed ? - 2 Prone - 2 Wound = Critical Glitch! T1 resists DV 9: Body ? (no Armor as a result of glitch) = 1 hit, T1 suffers 8 Physical Damage and dies.))**

Reth joins Frost in threatening An Peng. Between the machine pistol in his hand and the snarl on his face the ork is an intimidating sight.
<<[@Frost]Naturally omae. But these buildings are bound to have land lines. We need to get moving, fast.>>
Jin moves forward to cover the burning ork woman on the ground. However, there proves little need as she is unable to put out the flames consuming her and finally stops moving.
**((OOC: End of Combat))**
An Peng throws off his burning coat and pats himself down to smother the fading flames, though not without suffering some nasty burns. Between the guns pointed at him and the death of his entire crew even the stubborn Peng can see the wisdom of Jackson's words. The fire in his eyes goes out just like the smoldering embers of his ruined jacket. He holds his hands up in surrender with a sigh of defeat.
**"Fine, go. I won't try to stop you,"** the troll grumbles.

His soul merges into the machine fully as he feels the curb bump under his wheels and the heat from the fire on his panels. He guns it down the sidewalk trying to find a clear side street.

**<<Loading…Overlay Complete…Highlighting Alternate Routes>>**
Frosts connects to the van and his natural senses are replaced by the vehicle's. With traffic thinning out to a degree he is able to maneuver the van out from the cars wedged all around it. In his mind's eye a green arrow appears on the road guiding him in the proper direction. However it's sudden appearance distracts him momentarily and he scrapes the side of the van against an abandoned vehicle. Of course compared to the bullet holes and fire damage the state of the van's paint job should be the least of anyone's concerns.
The van, along with its retinue of bikes, continues along towards the rendezvous point. A few minutes out Frost notices a sign that reads 'Used Car Emporium'. The dealership appears closed for the evening.

Jackson pulls his bike in behind the van. He gets off his bike and walks over to the passenger side of the van. He regards the mage in the back seat, who looks like he’s seen better days.
“**Johnny, Johnny, Johnny. As your personal combat physician, I’m going to recommend you cut back on the drinking, smoking, drug use and potentially you will need to cut back on your sugar and salt intake. Did I miss anything? Oh yeah. Magic is also bad for your health, m’kay?**”
Jackson lets out a tension releasing chuckle. He holds his hands up in front of him.
“**Okay, all kidding aside. Where does it hurt?**”
Jackson takes a few moments to listen to Johnny and looks over his ills. He’s checking blood pressure, whether or not Johnny is coherent, his pupils, whether or not their dilated, and he’s checking for a possible concussion. ‘*You can never be too careful with these mage types*’ he thinks to himself. Jackson takes stock of the first aid kit in the van and determines what resources are available to help Johnny out.

Jackson assesses Johnny's wounds. He quickly realizes most of the trauma is the result of magical drain and beyond his skill to help out on the street. However the second degree burn on Johnny's chest is another matter; it lying much more within his area of expertise. Jackson cleans the wound, dresses it, and finally bandages it. He manages to find a pain killer that shouldn't react too badly to all the other chemicals swirling around the mage's system and Johnny actually begins to feel a little better.

Jackson gives Johnny a manly pat on the shoulder, but not hard enough to worsen his condition.
“**Sarge, the mage is going to pull through. He’s not combat worthy and I don’t suggest pushing him unless you have no other choice. Other than that, he’ll live to get paid.**”

*Very good work gentlemen, should anything else arise, for the love of God, let it kill me, eh?* he thinks at the watchers and then quickly recants his order. *Before you start, Wadsworth, that was rhetorical and not to be followed. You are of course to report anything untoward immediately.*

Johnny can sense Wadsworth's disappointment that the mage corrected himself before the troublesome spirit had a chance to interject. However the feeling is quickly replaced with elation.
**"Thank heavens, my tiresome tribulations are at an end. I bid you adieu."**
The smug spirit fades back from whence it came now that it's time of servitude had ended. The two remaining spirits assure Johnny they are at the ready.
**"Once again, I do apologize for his behavior master. We shall of course remain ever vigilant."**
==============================================================
The whine of sirens rings out in the distance and steadily grows louder as the cavalry approaches.
**"Every runner's favorite sound,"** Reth grumbles.
Wasting no time he and Jin rev their bikes and take the lead. The truck, a red Ford that could stand a new paintjob, runs fairly well for an older model. Unfortunately the vehicle lacks any rigging adaptation and Johnny's complaints about the truck's shocks are not entirely baseless.
==============================================================
***CAS Sector - 5:50 PM***
The team has finally managed to escape the traffic snarl and makes the rendezvous in only a few minutes. Arriving at the corner of 6th and Havana the team finds a dilapidated parking garage. It seems to be empty but within moments the disembodied head of Peaches appears as if from thin air. She smiles that surprisingly genuine looking smile she displayed over the commlink. With a flicker the rest of her body materializes and she waves the team over. Upon closer inspection it becomes obvious she is wearing a now deactivated chameleon suit.
**"Why Mista Jackson, has no one eva informed you that it is rude to keep a lady waiting?"**
Her smile turns into a pout, though she seems more playful than irritated.

Jackson parks and dismounts his bike. He walks over to Peaches, straightens up, assumes an ‘attention stance’, performs a sweeping bow, and takes her left hand in his right hand.
“**Ms. Peaches, please allow me to extend my most humble and most sincerest apologies; you are correct. A gentleman must never keep a lady waiting and as such, I do throw my self upon your tender mercies and ask for your forgiveness, just this one time.**”
He flashes a smile that belongs on a trid billboard advertising some type of new whitening toothpaste. He gently plants a kiss on her left hand and straightens up.
“**Ms. Peaches, allow me to introduce you to your cargo. Gentlemen, Ms. Peaches; Ms. Peaches, gentlemen. Ms. Peaches, on to business. Tell me, what’s the plan? We are all ears, except for Johnny…he’s all hands.**”

**"Tis quite rude indeed. Had I known a creature of such beauty as this was our destination I'd have burned the block faster. Why the hell did no one tell me she was waiting for us? Why is Jackson handling this part of the job? Damn him,"** Johnny whines and rambles through the open window of the truck, not caring who can or can't hear him. His injured state keeps him in the truck though, and from chasing along behind Jackson and Peaches.
**"Peaches eh? I bet she's sweet with just the right amount of bite to match the name, what do you say, Sir Frost?"** he asks with an appreciative leer.

## Re: Parliament of Thieves

### **Valheru** (2010-11-19 11:06:52)

Peaches smiles coyly at Jackson and curtsies, at least as well as one can in a chameleon suit.
**“With such a gracious apology it would be remiss of me not to furgive you.”**
In response to Johnny's comments the orkish belle raises an eyebrow. Her lips purse slightly in disapproval though her emerald eyes sparkle with amusement.
**“I do believe I see what you mean, Mista Jackson."**
Peaches curtsies to the rest of the team with a **"Pleasure to meet you gentlemen”** before turning back to Jackson. With her pleasant, nearly omnipresent, smile she indicates his parked bike.
**“If I could trouble you fur a lift we need to descend to the lowest level of the garage in orda to begin our journey.”**

## Re: Parliament of Thieves

### **Snowkrash** (2010-11-19 11:34:14)

Jackson extends his hand towards his Mirage.
“**This way, your chariot a-waits, Ms. Peaches**.” Jackson smiles broadly.
<<*@Frost: Why don’t we have Jin drop to the back; Peaches can ride with me up in front until we get to her vehicle and then I’ll resume my post after we get it up and running, er- I mean, after we get her up and running. Right. That’s what I meant, get her up and running*. >>
Jackson escorts Ms. Peaches to his bike; he gets on first and then waits until she mounts and is seated comfortably in place.
"**Ready?**" Jackson says to Ms. Peaches.

<<@Jackson Sounds fine to me>>
<<@Team: Ok Jin you take the rear with Reth. Jackson and Peaches will lead.>>
He waits for them to take off and then pulls out after them. He was missing the rigger control mod already. Just one more check point to bypass and they should be home free with a nice chunk of change.

## Re: Parliament of Thieves

Peaches links arms with Jackson as he escorts her to his vehicle.
**"What a nice ride you have here Mista Jackson."**
Even mounting a bike she manages to look graceful. Once seated she grabs Jackson tightly by the waist, though not uncomfortably so.
**"Ready,"** she affirms with a smile.
==============================================================
Jin grumbles under his breath about being sent to the rear but doesn't argue. Reth must have said something to him over the matrix because the two share a laugh.
The team reaches the bottom level of the garage swiftly. There they are momentarily halted by a rusty chain link fence, easily wide enough to allow even the truck passage. Signs proclaim a maintenance area lies beyond the fence and also warn against trespassing. However, Peaches slides off the bike and opens an equally rusted padlock before ushering the team through and relocking the gate. Entering the gate reveals several large antiquated plumbing systems. The smell, though hardly pleasant, is faint, suggesting the devices haven't been used in some time. There is no sign of Peaches' vehicle and she returns to her seat behind Jackson.
**"I do apologize for the smell. Sadly, in the name of discretion certain indignities must be tolerated. Let us continue on around the pumps and into the tunnels."**
**<<Reth@Team: Ugh, why didn't I get that cybersnout when I had the chance.>>**

**"Gods! If I get sick one of you is paying the bill. I never agreed to sewers!"** Johnny rants and fumes as he watches Peaches' mounting, dismounting and remounting of Jackson's bike. He starts to make a joke when the truck bounces over into the sewer proper, causing him a great deal of pain. He grits his teeth and stares daggers at Frost and Jackson in turn, not sure which he is more inclined to make the target of his petulance at traveling whilst injured through pestilent sewage pipes. *Go on damn you! Scout! Sing! Do something! My gods this hurts!* he thinks to his watchers.

## Re: Parliament of Thieves

### **Snowkrash** (2010-11-24 14:16:03)

Jackson takes note of Peaches' actions, performs an assessment of the situation and then asks his question.
“**Ms. Peaches, I have a question if I may? What type of…environmental hazards can we expect down here? Ghouls? Devil rats? Toxic shamans? UCAS politicians trying to get that last 1/10 of 1 percent demographic? What’s been your experience?**”
<<*@Frost: Sarge, your ‘wares suite wouldn’t include one of them really handy ultra-sonic/radar packages, would it? It just occurred to me, that we might need something more than just thermal IR and low light amplification down here. Not that I don’t trust our voluptuous guide, just wanna make sure we got all of our bases covered, ya know? Call me paranoid, but I never really got over the colonel screwing us over and leaving us in the zone. Just thought I’d throw that out there. You can never be too careful.* >>

### **Frost** (2010-11-28 04:02:03)

Frost frowns at the memories. His anger at the situation Jackson refers to starts to rise but Frost pushes it back down. He had to keep his cool and finish the mission, time enough for vengeance later.
<<@Jackson: Sorry no ultrasound sensors just the standard low light/thermo package. Might be worth investing in if we make this kinda border crossing a habit.>>
<<@Team: Status Check every one ready?>>

Jackson does an all group reply.

**"Oh my, you do have an active imagination don't you Mista Jackson?"** Peaches laughs charmingly.
**"Truth be told there have been reports of ghouls in the tunnels but I don't anticipate any trouble. Afta all it is my job to make sure you and your companions reach your destination safely. Still, ain't nothing wrong with being prepared."**
She grips the Colt at her side and smiles at Jackson.
Reth and Jin check in and the team heads off. Rounding the pumps leads to a large sewer pipe that, while hardly smooth, is still easily traversed by the caravan. The tunnels are lit only by the team's headlights, which reveal the occasional patch of graffiti. Fortunately the stench fades as the journey progresses, giving way to a more tolerable musty smell.
**"These tunnels are a mix of an abandoned sewer expansion project and old emergency shelter construction. Some say they date back to the Cold War, if you can believe that,"** the ork guide explains.
The trip passes in relative silence until the stillness is broken by a soft moaning.

## Re: Parliament of Thieves

### **Snowkrash** (2010-12-07 14:06:06)

Jackson smiles confidently at Peaches.
“**Oh my imagination stretches far beyond its professional capacity**.” He smirks coyly.
“**Ghouls? Right. We’ll keep an eye out**.”
Jackson slowly makes the journey through the tunnel system, enjoying the simple things about this assignment, like his passenger’s firm, but gentle touch around his….Jackson snaps back to reality and catches something in the background, something that seemed to be blending in with the rumbling of vehicles. Jackson looks back at Frost and gives him the ‘Slow to Stop’ hand sign.
<<*@Team: Did any of you hear that?* >>

Johnny slumps in the truck, miserable, his hands shaking quite a bit as he struggles to light one of the cigarettes from the bar. As the moaning noise drifts in at first he ignores it, thinking it's Wadsworth's whining again, then maybe a pain sound he himself made. The second time he hears it he stops moving, cigarette dangling from his lips, and looks around slowly, *Wait wait, Wadsworth is gone. I didn't make that noise. I haven't made a noise like that since the night with those dominatrix trans-gendered elves. So if it isn't Wadsworth, and it isn't me, it must be something else. Shit! It's something else! Wellington! Hernando!* he thinks as he sits up quickly and draws his primary pistol from its shoulder harness. **"Sir Frost, I just realized that wasn't me. What in the bloody blue hells was it?"** he asks in a slightly fearful tone.

## Re: Parliament of Thieves

### **Frost** (2010-12-08 16:22:48)

Things were going so well too, he thinks to himself. That didn't sound like a ghoul. He draws his pistol and gets prepped for battle. Hopefully this wasn't a spirit, their magical asset wasn't doing so at the moment. He scans through his optics switching to thermographic. Spirits could some times be spotted by cold spots, something about the link to the astral plain draining energy from ours. Should have payed more attention in magical theory.

Jackson leaves his left hand on the bike and with his free right hand, draws the Colt 2066 from his left shoulder holster. Though, if it is a spirit Jackson isn’t sure if bullets are going to do anything. '*Well, they seem to work in the trid movies anyway, you never can tell*' he thinks to himself.
“**Ms. Peaches, is that sound coming from our exit direction? And if so, how will this impact us reaching our destination? Do you have an alternate route in mind? And are you busy next Friday evening? Despite the smell of these tunnels, your perfume is intoxicating!**”
((OOC – *Jackson is actively looking for whatever is out there. High awareness level: Anxious, cautious and turned on by Peaches*.))
