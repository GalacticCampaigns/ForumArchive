The evening settles near the river stir and the only noise for miles is coming from a simple inn.
The STruting Cock is quite typical of the region, finding itself close to the river the inn present a small wooden dock to wich a few boats are attached, the main building house the common room, stable and living quarter of the innkeeper while a privy is located behind the inn. Next to the privy is an pit covered by an iron gate used to house prisoner while waiting for the roadwarden to show up and pass judgement.
The whole place is enclosed in by a wooden pallisade used to defend the inn from the various creature of the wild.
The Struting Cockis a lively place, Farmers, woodsmen, herdsmen and the like from a mile around has congregated on this evening and form groups in the smoked common room.
Some are drinking the stale ale served here, others are playing dice for pennies and shilling, other yet are discussing recent events, all are seemingly excited about something.

Quite a few people were gathered around the gambling tables, and at the end of one of them sat a gruff-looking dwarf with the dice in hand, and and tankard next to him. He had short, black hair, and a beard in the same color that was short by all dwarf standards, merely reaching the top of his chest. The face was that of a seasoned warrior, and across the left side of the face ran a vicious scar, crossing over his eye. An eye that was dark brown in color, in contrast to the blue one on the right side of his face. He was wearing a black leather jack and matching pants, and over that hung a ragged and worn uniform that was hard to identify, but a good guess would indicate that it belonged to the Imperial army. On the floor next to him was slumped a bad containing various goods, a shield bearing the symbols of dwarven gods, and a nasty-looking axe, a larger version of the two smaller axes fitted at his belt.
Coin on the table, he waited for his opponent to throw the dice.
"Come on ye snail, throw the dice already or hand yer coin over!"
It would seem obvious to anyone watching that the dwarf is slightly intoxicated.

The woodman in front of Garil bellowed a heavy laugh as the dice favoured him, quickly he dragged the pile of coins in front of him
"Seems you were a little short on luck this time Dwarf"

## Re: Pretty things

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-11-03 06:18:39)

Upon seeing the dice not going his way, the Dwarfs expression sours a bit, but at the others comment, he merely return with an even more thundering laugh.
"If ye opened yer eyes for a moment, ye´d see that dwarfs are short by nature, except where it counts"
Slamming his fist down on the table, he releases a collection of random coins and grabs the dice. Which is kind of hard to do when you are wearing a pair of armored gloves, and is sufficiently inebriated. But he still managed, with only a copper rolling of the table.
"But I figure we can raise the stakes, since it's all going to a good cause. Winner buys a round fer all, right?"
((Let´s get at it again, raising the stakes to 1gc, 8s, 3p))

The woodman eyes grow large at the appearance of gold, a sums of money rarely seen by anyone who doesn't live in one of the great city.
He rubbed his hairs anxiously, greed battling fear of losing what he had already won
The man threw all the money he had to match the bet of the dwarf, drawing his last pennies out of the recess of his stinking beast skin in wich he was wrapped
The dice rolled on the table and when the last of them fell, the dwarf had won.
The woodsman looked on the result with anger.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-11-03 07:05:14)

Upon seeing the dice fall in his favor, Garil lets out another thundering laugh.
"HAH, it seems Ranald smiles upon this dwarf today. Now, since it seems yer out of coin my friend, what do ye say we even out the balance over at the bar?"
Smiling, the Dwarf warrior scrapes up his winnings into his pouch.

### **Anonymous** (2009-11-03 07:13:47)

The woodsman grumble but decide against making a scene, the dwarf is obviously too well armed and trained.
He stand up dejectedly and move toward the bar, where the rotund inkeeper is busy cleaning some mugs.

### **Tempeste** (2009-11-03 08:35:49)

Dieter sat at the bar with a tankard of the local ale, it was strong but certainly no Bugman's Ale. Nonetheless, his mentor had impressioned upon him the joys of alcohol back in Talabheim, he'd mentioned something about how they should take a lesson from the Dwarfs. Being the devout of Sigmar this made perfect sense, there had to be some upsides to being a priest anyway. Dieter looked over as the stout dwarf approached the bar following another man, he raised his wooden tankard and let out a toast, "To Sigmar!"

Sitting in a corner of the Inn, looking at all the patrons and activities, Eldred could not make up his mind on which direction to take home North or South. His attention had been drawn to the boisterous laughter of a gambling Dwarf. He could hear enough of the conversation between the Dwarf and the Woodsman to understand what was at stake. Being a woods dweller most of his life, he decided to pick the woodsman as his favorite and decided his current delima would be decided on the outcome of the dice roll. If the woodsman won he would head north, staright to his family and home. If the Dwarf won he would head south towards Marienburg and an Archery tournament he had heard rumor of.
The Dwarf won, so south it was. Pleased that he had finally come to a resolution, he picks up his one and only tankard of ale for the night and silently toasts the Dwarf with a slight nod. He would stay here a little longer before heading up to his room to sleep before heading out in the morning.

On his way to the bar, Garil spots a human male, raising his tankard and offering a toast in the name of the highest Imperial god, Sigmar. Slamming enough coppers down on the bar for a drink to him and the woodsman, he turned towards the other human.
"Sorry to disappoint ye lad, but me drinks go to the Fearless one, to keep him warm as he watches over his kin"

## Re: Pretty things

### **Tempeste** (2009-11-03 17:41:41)

"Sigmar watches over us all brother. But Grimnir isn't a half bad choice," replies Dieter after wiping his lips from another swig. It seems he noticed the dwarfs uniform, "What brings you here Dwarf? Should I be reaching for my weapon to beat off invaders? haha."

## Re: Pretty things

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-11-03 18:01:58)

"If ye think ye can reach yer weapon before me fist reaches yer nose, then be me guest"
He slammed his armored fist down on the bar, both as a demonstration and a signal to the barkeep to hurry of with the drink.
"That is kind of how I ended here, by the way. Blasted human who thought higher rank meant more brains. I failed to convince the bastard otherwise, and so I was sent here to join the border patrol. At least the taverns are decent enough..."

### **Tempeste** (2009-11-03 20:05:31)

"You misunderstand, my friend. I was mearly asking why a soldier such as yourself would be here, but you just answered that question." Dieter nodded before finishing his tankard and slamming it onto the bar, "What say you use your winnings there to buy us all a round? The name's Dieter."

## Re: Pretty things

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-11-03 20:12:03)

At the mans suggestion, Garil lets out a roaring laugh.
"HAH, you´ve got some spirits for a human. But I'm afraid me winnings must be used to even out the balance between winner and loser, and then severely punish me alone for the sin of gambling"
With that he slammed his fist once again into the bar.
"That is of course if one can ever get some service here. Where´s my mead ye dolt?"

After rendering his silent salute to the Dwarf, Eldred continues to sip on his warm Ale and looking at the other patrons of the Inn. He was practicing his detail gathering abilities. Looking around the room he was making mental notes on all the people in here, trying to gather clues as to what they did for a living and if they were from this area. Simple things really, he just liked to keep his mind sharp. Maybe tomorrow morning he would practice his bow before leaving.

The rotund innkeeper serve some of his brew to the woodsman and the to the Garil. He then turns to Dieter with an inquisitional stare.
"I've never seen you around these parts before, are you simply passing trought ?"
Meanwhile, from the back of the inn, an inebriated herdsman catches Eldred starring at him and stand up drunkenly before approaching, wavering on the verge of failing on his arse.
"I don't...I don't like your face"

"Yes, here on business. I'll be gone soon but I may need a bed for the night." Dieter looked down at his red trimmed robe emblazened with Sigmarite insignia. "You haven't heard of anything unusual have you? Anything that'd i'd be duty bound to kill?"

If he hadn't been sitting in a corner, Eldred would have looked behind himself to see who the slob was talking to. As he speaks his next sentence, he visually searches the man for any signs of a ruse. "I'm sorry my face offends you, but there isn't much I can do about that." Standing up and moving closer so he was within arms reach, he offers his 'left' hand in a jesture of greeting and a big warm smile. "Let me buy you a drink to help you forget the ugly I have insulted you with." Fellow woods wanderer or not, he hated men who couldn't hold their drink. Two possible outcomes were running through the annoyed Hunter's head. One, the man would take the oddly offered 'left' hand, which would leave Eldred's right hand free to land a nice solid punch to the drunk's jaw. Two, the man wouldn't take his hand and Eldred would punch the slog in the jaw.
((Fellowship +39 to convence the Man to relax and take Eldred's offered hand. 'IF' the situation goes where Eldred wants it to, and I am not jumping too far ahead, +36 Strenght for an unarmed punch. I think I got it right.))

The innkeeper smiles and Reply to Dieter while washing the counter of his bar
"Just the usual, a few bandits on the road to the west, but I don't expect them to cause many troubles anymore."
He then grins proudly
"We have Heinz Gerbber locked up out back. A bounty hunter caught the scoundrel and brought him here. He'll ba back with the wardens in two days, and then they'll take care of that outlaw for good.
Otherwise, you might want to ask around, I don't go out much but I doubt the road would be particularly safe these days."
Meanwhile the Woodsman who is now busy drinking with Glaril wipe the foam on his mouth from the ale with his dirty and patched up sleeve.
"You should avoid leaving the road, there are goblins out there. You shouldn't travel alone. Nasty little buggers, even worse than dwarves, at least dwarves leave you alive after taking your money."
He then claps his hand hard against the Glaril's back, laughing loudly.
Farther back the drunken herdsman refuse to shake the hand of Eldred. The hunter shrugged and suddenly punched the drunken man in the jaw, sending him sprawling down on the floor.
At that point the innkeeper scream at them.
"Oy ! you lot, if you want to fight you'll have to take it outside!"

Tempted to folow up on his sucessful attack, Eldred decides to heed the Inn keepers warning and backs off. He steps back to his table and takes a sip of his Ale, keeping an eye open for any help the herdsman might have. He was also going to inform the now prone man about proper Bar ettiqute, but decided it would be a waste of time.

"Goblins don't deserve to live. If they are troubling travelers then it is my duty to remove them." Dieter brushed his hand against the hammer secured to his belt instinctively to ensure it was near, "As for the outlaw, I hope he gets what he deserves. And that you have him securely tied.."

Garil joins in the woodsmans roaring laughter, and clears his tankard in a single sweep.

"You like drinking don't you Dwarf? What say you about a little wager," Dieter chuckled at the thought of challenging a Dwarf to a drinking contest, it'd surely be fun. The Initiate of Sigmar looked towards his tankard, "Think you can drink more than I!?"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-11-05 17:19:40)

"Why of course I be thinkin that! Ye're a priest, and a skinny one at that. But since I've been building up a solid handicap for ye, I´d be feelin no shame fer losing"
The Dwarf looked at his empty tankard.
"But then it should not be this weak brew, but real fluids. Dwarven fluids!"

### **Anonymous** (2009-11-05 20:53:07)

The herdsman hadn't gotten up and there didn't seem to be any danger from the rest of the patrons so Eldred raised his tankard to his lips for another sip... nothing. Usually he didn't drink more than one at a sitting, but this drunken louse had unquenched his alcoholic thirst! Stepping over the unconcious body of the Hersman he takes his empty cup to the bar and asks for a re-fill. "Barkeep! Another of your finest!" He deposits his cup on the bara nd turns to face the direction of the Dwarf and his male companion. He listens to their conversation but also the ones being conducted by the locals, the difference being obvious.

The innkeeper answer Dieter before turning to the Glaril and then to Eldred.
"Don't worry Herr priest, Heinz Grebber isn't going anywhere, we threw him in the pit. Can you believe he tried to convince us that he wasn't who the bounty hunter said he was ?"
When Glaril Ask for something Better than is ale the Innkeeper turn towards him.
"Alas, we don't have anything else, the war made reapprovisioning hard, I hear there is even a famine farther north."
He then Refil the cup of Eldred.
In the back of the inn a couple of friends from the herdsman prop him up back against a chair, looking sullen.

"I'd hope it isn't a case of mistaken identity, but this is not my concern." Dieter looked at his still empty Tankard. "Barkeep, if you'd be so kind as to fill our Tankards with your strongest Beer I'd like to forget about all of these troubles!" He laughed a little.

Nodding to the Barkeep after he filled his cup, Eldred takes a quick look at the Herdsman's friends. He knew he needed to keep an eye on them in case they have an issue with his 'ugliness' as well.
Taking a sip of his refilled Ale cup, then setting it down on the bar he asks the Barkeep. "Excuse me Sir...I keep hearing about raiders and the like taking livestock from the Herdsman. Where is the law in this province?" Too late, he realizes that he talked over the Priest of Sigmar. "Oh! My apologies Priest. Please...ask your question, I will wait my turn as a civilized man should."

The innkeeper poured his strongest brew into the tankard of Dieter while answering Eldred's question.
"There isn't much law around here, I suppose the men of Count Von Liebig would help us in case we were attacked by an army of greenskin or things worse, but mostly it's the roadwarden who deal with keeping us safe. Still, you should be wary of them, the worst of them are little better than outlwas themselves."

At the mention of the lack of stronger brews, Garil's face darkens a little.
"Well then, luckily a good soldier keeps himself prepared, don´t ye think?"
Leaving the bar, the dwarf moves back over to his bag, where he keeps a few bottles of some stronger stuff.

"Umm...good to know. Thank you Barkeep." Sipping again on his Ale, he looks around the room and remembers something he had wanted to ask Sigmar's priest. Offering his hand to the Human. "Priest, I am Eldred of the Nordlands. I wish to put a question to you. Hwre would I find an acceptable place to worship the Great Unifyer? I have been lax of late and do not wish to incur the rath of a mighty god." His statement is said with a bit of light-heartedness, but there is an underlying stress to his voice.

Eldred gives the priest a half-smile, not sure what to make of this man. In his experience, Priests of Sigmar were usually humorless and illtempered. "Well, I'll keep that in mind until I can find a proper shrine to donate at. Thanks for the advice though."

After the first drink from the spirits in his bottle, the dwarf start going a little tipsy.

After a few sips from the bottle of dwarven spirits, Garil starts to feel a little dizzy. Not unused to this state of mind, the dwarf does feel like nature is demanding to have its course with him. Putting the plug back in the bottle, he lets out a loud burp.
"Excuse me gentlemen, but me body be calling out with signals that cannot be ignored. I´ll be back in a minute to continue this conversation"
Somewhat less than perfectly balanced, he starts to move towards the door. Stopping for a few seconds to catch his bearings, he continues (still as unbalanced as before) out the door to find a good spot to deposit some of natures gifts back to it.

"Thirty," Dieter mutters to himself a few times. "Thirty you say! I'm sure we could take them out if we gathered a few able men. The goblinoids are stupid and disorganised, we'd likely take them out a few at a time." Dieter quickly finished hus drink and wiped his mouth with the back of his bare hand, "It's best to destroy these creatures before they attract more. Lest we find our throats slit in the morning and our bodies left to decay."

Eldred had become interested in conversation between the Barkeep and the Sigmarite. "I'd be interested in helping destroy a goblin camp. Would you be willing to have me along Priest? I have a fair skill at hunting animals and killing them quickly. I'm sure the same would go for Goblins."

"I'd be glad to fight alongside you friend," replied Dieter after making eye contact with the man. "Have you fought the greenskins before?"

"They are little more than savage animals but you mustn't underestimate them too much, they're cowards when alone though and Sigmar will guide our weapons."

Returning the Priest' s stare evenly, Eldred answers with a sufficent amount of confidence. "I have never encountered Goblins, but I have hunted many kinds of animals, from the western coast to the mountains east. I have hunted Drakwald BEars and small rabbits, each has it's own kind of difficulties to deal with. So yes, I know I can kill a few unorganized animals."

Garil halted for a moment, and tried to focus. Was someone talking to him? Why yes, someone was. Stumbling a few steps to the left, he saw a pit. And there was a prisoner in it. He could make out enough of what was being said, to understand that the prisoner pleaded not to be Heinz Grebber, and that he was going to be wrongfully executed. Going down on one knee next to the pit (mostly not to fall in), he leaned closer.
"Aye lad, me be hearing what yer saying. Seems like ye´ve been imprisoned on pretty loose basis. But then again, ye don´t have much ground fer yer own story. But let me see what I can do. Who was it that brought ye here lad?"

Dieter nodded as the Huntsman finished speaking and then stood up. He eyed the patrons of the tavern one by one, trying to discern if any were perhaps in the military. He then asked for silence in a loud, somewhat commanding voice, "Brothers, today I ask of you all to serve the great Sigmar who forged these lands long ago. You surely know of the greenskins who infest these forests, preying on the weak and defenseless. Praying on our wives and our children, but no longer. It is time that we eradicated this infestation, and tought the blighters a lesson they'll not soon forget. Who of you will stand by my side and serve the Heldenhammer in completing his work? I will not be paying you, but with the goblins gone, trade will flourish and this area will be the better for it. Any farmers or merchants here will surely be better for it. So I ask of you to fulfill your duty!"

The patrons of the small inn look at DIeter as if he were completely crazy, a silence setled over the inn as a few embarrassed cough can be heard after his declaration.
The peoples of the inn look down at their drink, feeling ashamed but too cowardly to actually do anything.
One of them then speak softly, as if afraid of being heard.
"well" starting hesitantly "It's not that bad is it ?, I mean, it's just goblins, they don't exactly threaten us. they don't bother us on the river and no one is actually using the road so...."
The burly faced man then goes back to his drink, a few peoples murmuring their ascent.

"The road isn't used because it isn't safe!" Dieter had honestly expected more from the patrons, perhaps not all had the same devotion to the empire as himself. "Those beasts are abominations who would slit all our throats if given the chance. if we don't deal with them then you'll all live to regret it."

"Barkeep! Who´s the young lad ye got trapped in yer pit in the back?"
The innkeeper turns toward Glaril, glad for the distraction from Dieter sermon, he look down at the dwarf and speak in hushed tone, trying to avoid focusing dieter attention back on him.
It's the famous criminal hans grebber of course. Lars, the bounty hunter, brought him here, he should be back with the roadwardens in two days" He then start speaking a little louder "and the road will be much safer once that bandits swing at the end of a rope of course"
Meanwhile the peoples in the pub mutters their assent at the last word of the innkeeper. One of them even speak up
"The roadwarden can take care of the goblins, it's their job, we are just peasents"

The Dwarf and the Priest had more words in them than Eldred typically did. He continued to watch and contemplate the words being passed around the Inn. "Dieter, why not just go to the Gobo camp and se what we can see? I'm sure if they are the dumb lot most people speak about, then it shouldn't be too hard to get close." Throwing a glance at the man he had punched earlier. "Besides, I don't really want to be in a fight with men who are only brave when they have had more grog than they can handle." Nodding towards the swaying Dwarf. "I'd rather fight alongside one of him, than 20 of these any day or night." He finishes his sentence with a sweep of his cup hand across the whole of the Inn, indicating the cowardly patrons.

"You don't know the roadwarden, once they are here they will hang that man, they won't bother searching for new evidence. If you don't have proof that the man is innocent by the time they get here, he will be hanged. Unless you're willing to take on the roadwarden."

"You are right Dwarf. The guilty often claim innocence, and that is what the courts are for. Let the Wardens take him to the judge for proper judgement." He tilts his cup towards the Dwarf, using the motion to emphasize his next point. "Besides, if he really is innocent and it is just a case of mistaken identity, then there should be no evidence that he is the one the Wardens seek. True?" Waiting for a reply, Eldred looks over the lip of his mug at the Dwarf while taking another sip, which is difficult because the Dwarf is short and he has to tilt his head back to get at the remainder of his drink.

Eldred turns to the Inn keeper. "Has anyone bothered to find out if this man speaks the truth? He may be the accused criminal, but is he the real criminal?" He tilts the mug he was holding so he could see what he had left. Still mostly full, he was doing well.Getting drunk was not the way Eldred enjyed drinking. A nice warm feeling was all he ever wanted from his alcohol. "Besides, what proof do you have he is this Hans Gruber? Is is it just the word of a Bounty Hunter?" He stares at the Inn keeper, checking for any signs of doubt or deception.

Tracking the Gobos wasn't hard. There tracks were distinct and the goblins themselves didn't seem to be trying to hide their tracks much. Standing up from a crouch near the most recently found foot print, Eldred turns to answer Garil's question. "The tracks are fresh within the day. The ground here is too hard to know exactly when they passed through here. But they seem to be too stupid or too confident to care about covering there tracks. We shouldn't have a hard time following them. Pausing for a moment, Eldred scans the route ahead, looking for any signs of traps or alternate roots that the goblins might have left behind. "Did anyone bother to get a map for this area of the forest/ Might help pinpoint the exact location of the goblin camp."

Eldred follows the trail easily, ever going westward, farther and farther inside the forest, no traps or ambushes surprise the group and were it not for the prospect of violence in the end it would be no different than tracking a large slow and stupid rabbit. As time passes subtle clues give the number of goblins as 7, if they move quickly the group will be able to catch up with them in less than two hours.

Raising his hand as a sign to stop, Eldred steps close to the other two so he can speak in a whisper. "I think you should wait here while I go scout around the perimeter of the camp." Removing his 2 wineskins and any other excess equipment (Rations, Blanket, Tankard, Cutlery set, Common clothing), the Norland Hunter slips into the shadows of the forest surroundings. One step forward however and he looks back, waiting a moment for any advice or blessings the others might give.
Knowing he knows little about the goblins, Eldred decides to take his investigations slow and at a reasonable distance from the camp.

Realizing that he is too far from the camp to see anything, Eldred begins to move forward at a still slow pace. The last thing he wants now is to be swarmed by thirty Goblins, if that in fact was the true number.
A few feet past the point where he turns toward the camp, Eldred stops long enough to lay down one of his animal traps. This could buy him some time if he has to retreat from a horde of Goblins.

Eldred is as of yet undetected and seeing the goblins and the priests charging toward each other decide that it might be best to help in the fight rather than finish placing his traps and ready his bow and aim at the nearest goblin.
Meanwhile Dieter and 4 of the quickest goblins meet up in a thunderous crash. Dieter catches the nearest Goblin squarely in the face with his armor, sending blood and teeth flying. The goblins tries to attck Dieter but their blow are harmlessly turned aside by a sweep of his shield or parried by his hammer.

Dieter catches the goblin he had previously charged with a mighty swing of his hammer, crushing it's skull and spraying his brain against his kin. The other goblins aren't happy about this and one of them ducks under the shield of Dieter, leaving a long gash from his blade Dieter's leg.
Caught by surprise the priest fails to parry the blow of the second goblin and is felled by his blade.

The goblin that just felled Dieter gulps as he turn around to face the dwarf and scream "dwurfie ! halp !" Before taking a major blow to the sternum that open a deep wound.
At that point another arrow from Eldred is shot and fly into the hand of the goblin that was already injured in the leg with such force that it nearly cut it off at the wrist spurting blood. The goblin fall to his knees holding the stump of his hand and howling in pain.
The other spear throwers pick up shields and small but vicious looking swords and rushes into the bushes toward Eldred while the two remaining goblins face the dwarf. The one bleeding from the sternum is too weak and slow to pose any threat to Glaril but the other manages to land a blow on Glaril unprotected head.

"Down ye go yer stinkin greenskin!"
With his head bleeding, Garil was far from in his best shape, but he had been in this business long enough to know that once you were in the fray, you just needed to keep swinging. The only advantage he saw of the priest being low was that now he could swing his axe more freely. Holding the weapon by the shaft, he swung it in wild and vicious circles, simply seeking to find something to hit.

The circling slash of tGlaril takes the wounded goblin by surprise and he just stand there blinking for a few seconds. Just when he open his mouth to exclaim his disbelief at surviving the attack his head slide diagonaly, cut right in the middle and he falls down, blood erupting from where his face used to be. The other Goblins flails widely in terror at Garil but fails to connect
In the bushes Eldred see the two goblins approaching and unsheate his sword, ludging at the closest one only to have his thrust meet the shield of his enemy.

A little farther the goblin that lost an hand agonize, slowly bleeding to death.

The following day the group is woken up at dawn by the innkeeper and Dieter, after the quiet night, manages to clean and close the worst of the wounds of his companions and himself.
An hour later a coach pulled by a team of two horses approach the strutting cock from the north, escorted by 7 men. The peoples in the Inn are curious, watching from the windows and talk to each other excitedly. A man dressed in a well kept uniform enter the strutting cock followed by the seven men, one of wich is dressed very differently, from the whispering the group gather that it must be the roadwarden captain Leonhard Kurtz and his men, the last one should be Lars, the bounty hunter.
The Captain call on Josef, the innkeeper, to clear away the tables and order two of his men to go to the lock up and gather the prisoner.
When he is brought in, the captain turn toward him and declare:
"You are accused of being Heinz Greber, a notorious outlaw chief who led other scum to commit foul thieving, assaults and other crimes upon the honest folks of this region during the past four months. What have you to say for yourself ?"
"I-I plead innocence mylord" say the prisoner, "for I AM NOT THE MAN YOU CLAIM I AM! My name is Emmerich Handler, not Heinz Greber. Please spare my life, milord, and I shall leave these lands."
From the look on the captain face it is clear he doesn't believe Handler. He says, "What proof do you have of your innocence ? Who will come forth and support your claims ?"
((okay so here are how things stand: Glaril is back to 13 wounds, down to 5gc 17s and 10p, and down to one healing poultice. Dieter is up to 4 wounds and down to 7gc, 19s and 7p. And Eldred is up to 10 wounds down to 3gc, 3s and 7p and 28 arrows.))

And by Sigmar i've heard of no such evidence fit enough to send this man to hang."

He didn't care if the man was innocent or not. The justice in the wilds was flexible at best and Eldred knew of a few people who were found innocent after their deaths. So this was nothing new to him. Getting up from his table and walking over to stand next to the Dwarf, Eldred speaks to the Warden. "Sir, I do not defend this man as strongly as my friend here, but I do ask that a little justice is attempted when a man proclaims his innocence so strongly. He claims to have family near by that will clear his name. Maybe a short trip to his home will allow you to free the innocent and continue looking for the guilty." His piece said, Eldred stands in place, with his hands resting on his belt and sword hilt.

I am the law here and in these times I'd rather not lose time dealing with this when I have more important things to do. If you're so keen on saving him and if what you say about a family of his nearby I wonder why you haven't gotten there and brought them. I'm inclined to think that you're part of his band."

"Are you accusing a priest of sigmar? By the grand theogonist I'll see you burn for heresy if you pursue such a course of action." Dieter stepped towards the so-called captain as if to afford him a better view of his robe, which clearly marked him as belonging to the church of Sigmar. "Maybe if you didn't waste your time hanging innocent men and took care of the bandits and greenskins that plague the area, these men wouldn't have to resort to crime in the first place. The only guilty man here is you."

Clearing his throat of something and spitting it out on the floor, Garil lifted his arms away from his axe, and grabbed it near the hilt, but let it hang, head down at his side.

With the Warden's last dimissive words, Eldred steps forward. "Sir Warden, I have two requests, although you are under no obligation to grant them. The requests will be beneficial to us all by hurrying this investigation along." Raising his hand up in front of his face to show his fingers. "One, can the man you send with us be one from this area, if you have such a henchman? Two, can you provide us with as much information you have regarding the bandit's doings, such as dates and places?" Droping his hand, he waits for a possitive response.

"So far you haven't given the 'mpression you're so trustworthy, I think that men will be dead by the time we're back. You just want us out of the way." Dieter really disliked being messed around, especially by those in a position of power who seemed to misuse it, "You'll let that man into our custody and leave with no more hassle, understand?"

"Bah, don´t ye bother lads. These fellows ain´t interested in justice, they just want to hang someone so they can show how good they are to their masters. It doesn´t matter to them who they put in the gallows, as long as someone goes there. An' the bastards are just too lazy to make sure they actually have the right person"
Garil took a pause to look around the tavern. He didn´t care if they beleived the man to be guilty or not, but he had hoped that at least someone would care enough to not let them hang him on such loose grounds. Personally, he had little problem sending a man to the gallows, but not before he had been proven guilty.
"Sadly enough, they don´t seem to be the only ones..."

the captain turn to Dieter
"Thread carefuly, I am the law here, and you have little to prove your identity, that robe could have been taken on a real priest in a raid.
I do not like being called a liar, you had ample time to go and gather witness to this man innocence, but you're bloodthirsty and decided to go kill goblins instead. I'm being very generous and giving you one chance to go and prove his innocence. If you don't like it leave. But if you keep insulting me and my men you will hang too."

Taking the man's warning seriously, Eldred decides to relax his aggressive stance and try to speak some sense to his comrades. "I have an idea. Why don't Garil and me head to the man's home and find family while Dieter stays here?" Presenting the question to the whole group, he decides to push his luck a little and ask for something from the Warden. "Having a strong sense of justice I know you have, I would like to ask for the use of two of your horses. This could allow mw ample time to find a witness and get back here quickly. What do you say?"

The Captain snarled at Eldred "horses are more valuable than you are right now, if you're in a hurry I suggest you take the boat"

"Alright, I get it. No horses."Ledred didn't like this man, but he understood his apprehension to help the three strangers. In this world, strangers offering to help anyone usually expected more than the help was worth.
"Dieter. I still think keeping you here to watch over this man is a good choice. What do you say? Garil?

Dieter nods at the dwarf and Eldred and reply while looking at the captain
"I will stay behind to assure that they don't kill this poor man, and if they try, by Sigmar they shall feel the steel of my hammer"
Soon afterward, Eldred, Garil and one of the Roadwarden embark aboard a boat setting sail for the small village of Gersdorf.
The journey is slow and the Roadwarden ignores the two adventurers.
In half a day time they reach the village and the boat anchor at the small docks.
The village is small and quite typical of the region, extending from the docks are two walls of wooden post circling the cluster of house, pierced by three gate, one for each of the dirt roads leading to other nearby village. Outside the walls, small farmlands are being tended to and a few hundred feet farther begins the forest to the west and the Kolsa hills to the north. The river delimiting the south and east border of the village.

Stepping off the boat first, Eldred glances back at Garil. "What was the guys name again? Did he say he had a mother here or was it a wife? I honestly can't remember."
Waiting for the other two to leave the boat, Eldred takes a large drink of his mead. "Nothing like a long boat ride to make ya thirsty aye?"
