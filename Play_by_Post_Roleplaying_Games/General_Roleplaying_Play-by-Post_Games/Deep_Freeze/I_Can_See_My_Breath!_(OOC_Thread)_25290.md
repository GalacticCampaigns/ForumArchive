# I Can See My Breath! (OOC Thread)

### **BWS2K** (2012-11-16 11:39:30)

Welcome, one and all, to *Deep Freeze*! The game is scheduled to start on November 19th if all goes according to plan, and here is where players can chat freely with the GM and each other, and spectators can chime in as well! Enjoy!

How familiar are you guys with [Roll20](http://roll20.net/ "http://roll20.net/")? I recently discovered it and it looks pretty cool. Live chat (and mic if you have it), dice rolling, map and token movement, etc. Could be really cool to schedule a session at some point if possible, maybe for a battle or something. I've never actually used this system and it might be easier to have a chat where we can tackle any questions/problems as they arise, and cover lengthy actions or conversations. There's also the Galactic Campaigns chat channel which we can try to use as well, though it's just for chatting (but I can handle rolling if you like).
Just figured I'd get a feel for it, lemme know what you think. Happy posting!

I am fine with Roll20. I use it with another game that I am in with Alicia.

Forgot already the [chat room](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=25007 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=25007")has dice rolling? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

...no.
Obviously I was, um, referring to the... other... chat room... The one that doesn't have that. But we could use yours too, if people wanted. 'Cause it's easier that way. You know, whatever seems best. <!-- s:red: -->![:red:](https://i.ibb.co/xStHX79F/icon-redface.gif)<!-- s:red: -->

I was wondering why no one had posted yet, and I realized you might not have noticed because I only edited over what was already there. The intro post has been up since Monday early morning, fyi. No pressure, just making sure ya'll know. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

LOL! You got it right. I had no idea the intro was up. Will post in a while. Thanks for he heads up! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Come to think of it.... an elf, a dwarf and a human. I think I've read and seen this before... <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

### **Duggs** (2012-11-22 10:33:30)

I wasn't sure if my character should have a small dislike of the elf, since they are usually against each other. Have we met before or is this our first time meeting?

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-11-22 10:52:32)

> Have we met before or is this our first time meeting?

A valid question - talk amongst yourselves while we wait on DA!

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2012-11-22 20:32:02)

> Have we met before or is this our first time meeting?

Also my concern. It's quite hard to post with very little to work with.
More details please...
How did we meet? How long have we been companions? Why are we at the Smiling Cat? Some info that would eliminate the guess works.
Thanks! <!-- s:)) -->![:))](https://i.ibb.co/ZRrbtNtj/icon-razz.gif)<!-- s:)) -->

### **BWS2K** (2012-11-22 21:19:43)

Apologies - I think I'm being misunderstood.
You're in the *Smiling Cat* because I'm the GM and I put you there. How your characters got to be there, and whether or not they know each other (did they arrange to meet there? are they some of the many passers-by that sought shelter from the storm? are they frequent visitors? etc.) is entirely up to *you* - hence the "talk amongst yourselves" comment. This is just an opportunity to roleplay and chat, which will end soon enough. I'm totally posting tomorrow even if DA doesn't show up though, and he'll regret that in some minor way which will be inconvenient for him and amusing for all of us. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
Happy Thanksgiving!

### **Duggs** (2012-11-23 10:12:11)

I think that with how busy this tavern is it would be quite feasible that we have never met before and we all just happened to sit at the same table. That will eliminate us trying to come up with back stories and reasons we know each other and are traveling together, since this is kind of a random group of people. Also it will be more enjoyable to make things up as we go and try and make this group work together.
That is just my opinion.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2012-11-23 10:24:11)

Sounds good to me Duggs.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-11-25 07:12:26)

Just to let you guys know, next weekend is going to be tricky for me. My eldest daughter is having surgery on Friday morning and we're moving the rest of the weekend. Is everyone able and willing to do a chat at some point the *following* week or weekend (7th/8th/9th)? We can keep posting for now but I anticipate some semblance of combat by then and it may be easier to do live. I'm on the East Coast of the US (it's 7:11am right now).

This might not be possible on my end since we're practically on opposite sides of the globe and 13 hours apart. If this would slow things down, please feel free to take control of my character.
I hope your daughter quickly recovers from her upcoming surgery. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **BWS2K** (2012-11-26 07:27:12)

Thanks!
And I work third shift, so you and I are probably on a closer schedule than me and my neighbors! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> I'll let you know if/when it happens anyway, and we'll figure it all out then.

### **Duggs** (2012-11-26 19:59:09)

Sorry that I have not been active the last few days. I am on leave and visiting my family, so I haven't been able to get on here as much. I will be back home on the 4th and should be free the weekend after.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-12-06 12:44:43)

Hey guys! I haven't forgotten about the game but things are proving to be a little more challenging than we thought. My daughter is doing alright under the circumstances (the surgery went well), it's just more touch-and-go than we thought it would be. I definitely want to keep this going but it may be a little longer than I anticipated. Thanks for any thoughts and prayers you want to send our way - we can totally use them! <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

My prayers for your daughter`s speedy recovery.

Good question... The wolfman is definitely something unique, it's not like a widespread phenomenon or anything. But then again strange things happen in the land more often now than before, what with the Radiant Queen and all that. I always encourage creativity but I know this is a new system and I'm still learning things too. Solkanus can try a Difficult *Lore* check to see if any of this rings a bell, and don't forget you can use a hero point to grant a +6 to that result (RAW say you declare it first, before you roll - I'm cool with you deciding after the roll though) because a Difficult is at least a *16* (if I remember correctly). Your *Lore* skill defaults to *Wit*, so roll that.
Daegin is welcome to try this as well, btw, but a success for him would mean something slightly different (though still useful). A success for both of you would obviously be awesome... and would make me feel better about having the inn attacked by snow goblins. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->
You guys are sort of in the middle of talking to each other - WHICH IS AWESOME FOR ME AS A GM - so I won't interrupt until it's clear you're ready to move on.

Cool! I'll make my roll on my next post.

### **BWS2K** (2012-12-25 11:29:46)

Merry Christmas guys! As if the surgery and the move weren't exciting enough, I've accepted a position at a new job and am looking for part-time work to fill in the gaps - so not much posting anywhere for me really lately. I hope you all have a great day and a Happy New Years!!!

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2012-12-29 14:08:08)

No worries BW.
Happy New Year!

### **Alicia** (2013-03-16 22:55:42)

Long time coming, but I'll be closing up this forum here on Tuesday the 26. Please remove anything out of this OOC.
I'll be sending over character sheets shortly.
