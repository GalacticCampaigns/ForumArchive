[![itsln.jpg](http://www.freeimagehosting.net/t/itsln.jpg)](http://www.freeimagehosting.net/itsln "http://www.freeimagehosting.net/itsln")
**Quote:** For your own good, leave me be.
**Appearance:** Lithe in stature and moves with unearthly grace. He exudes an aura of menace which makes most people jittery in his presence. An air of mystery in his person further accentuated by the cloak which hides his features. The only notable feature is a tattoo of an ornate compass on the dorsum of his right hand.
**Personality:** Having survived an abduction with no recollection of what was done to him, Solkanus is distrustful of others. He is always wary bordering paranoia, keeping an eye for the crimson cloaked enemies. Detached, always wants to be left alone, it will be very hard for him to earn friends. However, he has a soft spot to those he sees as victims of circumstances beyond their control and he will lend assistance to those he deems truly in need.
Though quiet most of the time and surly when he have to speak, he has a habit of blurting out a cynical comment here and there.

**Background:**
Solkanus was born and raised in a sizable elven community between Lorna Elon and Devmorra. He was a jovial person and quick to make friends.
When he reached adulthood, his talent for sorcery surfaced and was immediately apprenticed to the well-known wizard Tranar. It was during his tutelage when he discovered that he could not harm anyone with his magic. He could not establish if this is a psychological limitation wherein he subconsciously fails his spell when trying to harm others or if his magic is just simply different. Even his master is at a loss. Nonetheless, he continued his study in the arcane arts and concentrated on spells affecting himself.
A life changing event occurred when he was abducted by crimson cloaked adversaries during one of his adventures with his master. He woke up a year later in the wilderness near Kauleshan with no recollection on what happened to him after his abduction. His only remembrance was the ornate compass tattoo which seemed to emanate a crimson glow when he works his magic.
Henceforth, he’d become distrustful of others. This attitude is somehow intensified by the feeling that he’s being watched and the rare occasion that he catches a glimpse of a crimson blur in the corner of his eyes.
