*When the Radiant Queen conquered all off Castia decades ago, she began with the Northern territory known as Kauleshan - a place already filled to the brim with cold brooding evils hidden in deep dark places. The people were considered savages and left alone, which suited them just fine. Contact with those "over the mountains" was tense and infrequent. Time changes many things though, and unlikely alliances are born of adversity. Those from the North that shunned the Queen's enlistment before her power grew managed to avoid her attention - allowing life to continue much as it had before. Refugees began appearing from all over the Southern regions of the continent and were increasingly accepted for their friendship, skills, or gold. The skalds who once told legends of hope were few in number now, but no less active in encouraging the notion that while the Queen's evil started from the lands of Kauleshan, deliverance would come from within as well. A dangerous hope, but one that has been growing as of late…
A small tavern nestled in the woods just North of Kauleshan proper called The Smiling Cat is having an unusually busy night. Travelers from all over have been streaming in for the last few hours and the owner and his wife are finding it challenging to keep up with the cooking, lodging, and drink orders. The first two can be forgiven, the third perhaps less so. The atmosphere is far from gloomy though - everyone knows this is due to be the coldest night of the season and the picture is typical of almost every inn and pub for miles. Most folks are content to simply be in out of the weather. Snow is a constant companion in these lands but tonight is particularly bad, and light from the tavern and its upstairs rooms spill out onto the growing snow drifts and are easily spotted in the dark outside - perhaps this more than anything has lead to the influx of patrons.
Among them are three strangers: an elven wizard, an ale-loving dwarf, and a well-traveled young man with tattooed forearms. Crowded at a small table towards the back of the tavern, the three are enjoying themselves as much as possible in such circumstances. Next to the table is a window through which can be seen the falling snow and the dark forest beyond. The serving woman makes a quick stop to top off the drinks and continues on her rounds, leaving the party to themselves…*

That's good for now. Go ahead and move your characters to the Cooler and keep OOC chat in the I Can See My Breath! thread ((or in double parenthesis if short)). Take a post or two to introduce your characters and maybe have some RP chat or whatnot. Adventure awaits - welcome to *Deep Freeze!*

The Smiling Cat is exceptionally busy today. In this desolate, cold place, the tavern acts like a beacon in the vast white sea, people coming in like moths attracted to fire.
*"Where are these people coming from? Are they refugees or just travellers seeking safe passage?"* he can't help asking himself, the inquistive mind of a mage at work.
This train of thougths leads him to ponder on his current predicament.
In a sense, he's also a refugee. A victim.
It's been almost a year since his abduction. Solkanus was hoping that somehow, time would bring back his lost memories. Alas, still nothing! Not a sliver of recollection. *Who were they? Why was I taken? What did they do to me?* For almost a year, the same questions have been gnawing at him. Questions that may never find answers. Everytime, he relives the experience of his abduction. The crimson cloaks, the chase, the fight, his takedown and the darkness that followed.
His musings is cut short when the serving girl approached to fill up his tankard as well as those of his companion. He nods slightly to the girl as a gesture of appreciation.

He spends his time looking around the tavern in slight disgust.
*Blasted full tavern. A dwarf can't even drink in peace here.*
**"Too many people in here. I can't even get a good flow of ale going."** He looks around the table at the guys with him. **"A tavern this crowded is only good for a bit of fighting."**
As the serving girl passes to refill their cups he grabs her attention. **"I need a second cup so I don't have to wait so long to get a refill."**
He goes back to looking around the table waiting for the guys that he is with to say anything.

The girl, probably in her late teens and likely the owner's daughter, makes a face and replies to the dwarf in a matter-of-fact voice:
"**And I could use a second set of hands to-**" ...but her retort is cut off suddenly as the tray of ale tips a bit too much to one side and spills its contents onto the quiet young man seated at the table. The girl's entire demeanor changes and she's all apologies as she sets down the tray and begins to work at cleaning the mess with her apron - an futile gesture no matter how sincere her words. The drenched patron remains silent for the time being, though whether from shock or something else is anyone's guess. The non-humans at the table manage to stay dry and the unguarded half-empty steins could prove to be a fortunate turn of events for those wishing to capitalize on the "disaster".
The owner appears moments later, even more apologetic than the girl, and offers a free round for the whole table on the house. The scene is repeated throughout the night in various other pubs throughout the region no doubt, and in any case a free drink usually makes things better, no matter the damage done. The commotion lasts for a few minutes until all returns to normal and the *'Cat* returns to its jovial self.

Solkanus barely avoided the splashes of ale which drenched the tatooed human.
**Hey watch it missy! I came here for a drink, not a bath!**,he rasped, standing up to check his cloak for traces of ale. Convinced that he's completely dry, he sat back back in his chair which he movedd a bit farther from his dripping companion.
**I doubt the extra hands would do you good…** he croaked, then consumed the rest of his drink.
The Smiling Cat's owner's offer for a round of free drinks seemed to lighten his mood a bit. After all, something good came out of something bad.
*Good for me, bad for the human*. He smirked at the situation.

He watches as the drinks spill all over the tattooed human and he slowly moves a few of the unguarded steins closer in front of him as he laughs at the now soaked man.
**"I would have to say that I have gotten baths from worse looking women."** he says as he looks himself over and sees that he is completely dry and laughs at his own joke as he chugs down what is left from the steins that he had just acquired.
When the owner comes over and offers a free round on the house he makes sure to point at his extra mugs. **"Don't forget to fill up my friends mugs."**
*There is no way that I could pass up some free drinks.* He laughs again at the whole situation.

The drinking continues well into the night and features various artisans and performers - also seeking refuge from the cold - entertaining everyone present. It's during a lull in the festivities that Solkanus happens to glance out of the window and see two large eyes glaring at from the shadows. Daegin doesn't notice the strange observer - likely because of all the ale he's consumed in the last few hours. As the eyes advance into the light from the window, the wizard can see that they belong to a very large white wolf. It's at least as large as a man and that's exactly what it begins to transform into - a tall, burly man wearing pelts below the waist and nothing above. His bald head and long beard give the look of a noble savage, though he appears unarmed.
The man walks around the side of the inn and enters through the main door. Perhaps it's because of his size, or his heavily tattooed chest, or maybe just the late hour, but everyone turns to look at him for a moment before resuming their conversations. The owner approaches jovially and begins to speak:
"**Good evening sir! Can I-**"
The man waves him away and, spotting Solkanus and Daegin, walks steadily in their direction.

Same old Daegin - drink drink drink! ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)
I wanted to give you guys a chance to act first, since a wolf-man has just walked up to your table and you might have something to say. I'll try and get another post or two in before this weekend but then I'll be occupied with moving and my daughter's surgery for a while. Happy Tuesday!

Noticing the pair of large eyes staring at him from the darkness nearly startled Solkanus off his seat. Nonetheless, he remained composed. When the glowing pair of eyes advanced towards the light, revealing itself as a man-sized wolf, he quickly unsheathes his knife for a possible attack. However, when it transformed into a an unarmed well built man, Solkanus re-sheathes back his weapon.
*"He's not here to fight,"* he thought to himself. *"otherwise, he would have maintained his wolf form."*
When, the half naked man entered the tavern then looked towards their table, the wizard figured he's here to talk.
Talking is not really Solkanus' strong points. His unassuming form and surly demeanor never really got him in good terms with anyone. Good thing he has a spell to alleviate that shortcoming.
While the wolfman is distracted by the tavern owner, Solkanus worked his magick to enhance his mediocre form & personality.

He watches the entertainers as he enjoys his mugs of ale. He is just drinking and laughing and talking with those around him.
*Maybe this night isn't as bad as I had thought.*
He takes notice to the burly man that walks into the tavern and is surprised that he waves off the keep as he start moving straight for him and his elven companion.
*Of course, I might have spoken too soon.*
As the man gets to his table he just looks up at him and slides over an untouched mug of ale, though it seems surprising that the dwarf hasn't drank it yet.
**"Have a drink and pull up a chair friend."** He says as he is still eying the newcomer.

The burly man looks first at Solkanus, then at Daegin, without uttering a word. He merely grunts at the dwarf's offer and reaches into the folds of his furs, only to retrieve a small package no larger than a man's closed fist. It's wrapped in simple brown parchment paper and falls to the table with a clanging sound, perhaps indicating its contents. The wolf-man then turns and leaves as suddenly as he appeared. A blast of cold air makes it in before the innkeeper manages to shut the door behind him.
"**Well, it takes all sorts I suppose,**" mutters the innkeeper, "**but the rude ones'd just as well stay away from here, thank you very much!**"
A couple nervous laughs later and things return to normal for most in the room. Being as it's late however, some choose this time to make their way to bed upstairs or in the adjoining building, or to head back to camp nearby. The strange visitor is not entirely forgotten though, and not a few adventurers turn their eyes back to the package, wondering what the wizard and the dwarf plan to do with it. The innkeeper's daughter seems to take a special interest as well, though whether it's for the mysterious parcel or the wizard who has somehow become more appealing in her sight isn't exactly clear.
"**Aren'tchya gonna *open* it?**" she says, moving in close to Solkanus with a curious and not altogether unfriendly look.

Okay, sorry for the delay - I'll try to keep this moving as best I can now. I think DA is simply out, and that's my call as GM - it's just the Kupa and Duggs for now. I like Wolfman, but he's not ready to talk just yet. Maybe when he's had some wolf coffee and Pop-tarts or something. Be that as it may, you now have the opportunity to see if I'm the kind of GM that lets you get plot devices easily because he's had a rough couple weeks and wants to get this show on the road or if he's the kind that likes to give you crazy trinkets from wolf-people that may or may not blow up in your faces. Your spell didn't really work on Wolfy btw Kupa, so I gave you a lovely young innkeeper's daughter instead. Be nice. Game on!

Uncertain whether his spell worked or not, Solkanus assumed it did. Why would the wolfman hand them a parcel if it didn't work? Still, the risk is there. He could be leaving with them something nasty.
Hearing the comment of the innkeepers's daughter, Solkanus is tempted to open the parcel right then and there. Unexpecting her sudden interest in him and the parcel, Solkanus just gave her a wry smile.
Thinking that the mysterious parcel wasn't given only to him, he consulted his dwarf companion, **"So Daegin, do we open this now?"**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

LOL! Much as I would like to take on your innkeeper's daughter offer, I think Solkanus being the surly type that he is wouldn't be much interested. Besides, the wench is well guarded by the old coot. ![:))](https://i.ibb.co/ZRrbtNtj/icon-razz.gif)

**"I don't see why we wouldn't. Hell, what's the worst that could happen?"** Maybe it was his slight inebriation, or just his lack of cares in the world, but he seemed like having random parcels, from random people, being dropped in front of him was quite normal.
He reaches over and takes the parcel and then opens it and sets it on the table in front of them. (That is if he can set it down.)
**"How hard was that?"** He says with a smirk and a wink towards the Keep's daughter, who has been bringing him ale most of the night.

The girl smiles politely at Daegin, an expression she has practiced countless times on drunk or unruly patrons, but still seems to favor the wizard. The package lays open, its contents easy for any and all to see - a small gilded key and a handwritten note. Solkanus can identify the inked characters only as having some sort of magical meaning while Daegin recognizes a Dwarven style to them. Neither, however, can actually translate the glyphs themselves. The author has also drawn a small schematic or map that could describe some sort of large dwelling, cavern, or some such facility - there seem to be hallways, rooms, and doors represented with easy-to-read symbols, though some have glyphs next to them as well. Perhaps these describe traps or mark important locations. The top of the schematic has a door with a scribbled picture of what is most likely the key that was included with the note.
"**Wow…**" says the girl, "**What d'ya suppose it says?**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Eventually we should give the girl a name I guess. Also - take your time about how you want to proceed. You've got time, and I'll point out the most obvious part... namely, that you don't have a map to wherever that facility might be located yet. Feel free to use the OOC thread to chat about it, or ask me for clarification.

**“Honestly, I have no idea.”** Solkanus addressed the maiden, feeling a bit of discomfort in her extra friendliness.
**“How about you Daegin? Does any of this ring a bell?”** veering his gaze towards the dwarf.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I've written in my background that I have been in Kauleshan for a year. Is there any chance I've somehow acquired useful info on the wolfmen in the area during my stay there. If not, perhaps a village elder I happen to know who might have the said info? ![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)

He grabs the note and looks it over as he speaks. **"They look almost dwarven, but I can't make out what any of it says. I guess we had better find someone that can read them, or at least tell us where this place is."** He sets the note back on the table once he is done inspecting it.
He takes a look out the window at the darkness and snow. **"Perhaps we should sleep on it and try to figure it out when it isn't so dark outside."**

**"You are absolutely right. We're not getting answers while its still dark. We'll ask around tomorrow for someone who could give us answers."** nodding at the dwarf in agreement.
**"So miss, do you hapen to have a name?"** Solkanus now shifting back his attention towards the innkeeper's daughter.
**"Perhaps you or your father could refer to us someone around here who have knowledge on obscure languages?"**, the wizard asked while beaming his best smile.

### **BWS2K** (2012-12-18 19:14:23)

The girl returns the smile and replies: "**I'm Kelyn, but you can call me *Kel*. And I don't know of anyone myself but let me go ask Daddy. Don't go anywhere!**"
Kel leaves the table for a while in search of her father as the crowd begins to thin out. Anyone still around at this point is probably lodging at the inn - it's too late to be traveling out in such harsh weather. Someone by the hearth begins tuning a lute in preparation for some late night atmosphere but then seems to decide against it, whether because of the odd goings-on of the evening or too much drink is hard to tell. Likely both. The owner of the inn approaches the table a short while later and addresses the pair:
"**Aerallo Aelara at yer service gentlemen, m'daughter tells me you're lookin' for someone with a knack for languages. The man you want is named Radanash, down in the town 'bout two miles North of here. Everfrost, it's called. Not a very creative name but descriptive enough and full'a helpful folks. Well, mostly. No use tryin' ta make there tonight - why don't you take the last room in the inn? You've the look of adventure about'chya, and I wouldn't want to stand in th'way!**"
He pulls a ring of keys from his belt and places one beside the package on the table.
"**Hmm,**" he mutters, noticing the open package for the first time, "**Adventure *indeed*…!**"

I love random name generators almost as much as perceptive innkeepers. Especially the ones who don't like their daughter flirting with strangers... lol!

**"Thank you very much for the valuable referral Aerallo!"** Solkanus, slightly bowing to express his gratitude. **"Thanks also Kelyn for bringing your father over."**
Looking back at the innkeeper, **"We'll take your last room before someone else beats us to it."**, the elf said with a smile while picking up the keys set on the table.
Directing his attention to his dwarf companion, **"Ei! I hope you have no qualms sharing a room with an elf Daegin."**  he said in a slight jest.

He looks as though he is taking a whiff of air from Solkanus' direction. **"Well, you don't smell like a wood elf."** He says and then chuckles some. **"I will let you know though, I don't cuddle."** He laughs at his joke.
**"Of course, that is unless you wanted to cuddle."** He says looking at Kel, with a big smile. He laughs again for no apparent reason.

Solkanus could barely contain his laughter at the dwarf's joke. He never realized dwarves could have such sense of humor.
When Daegin directed his joke on Kel, Solkanus observed closely how Aerallo and Kel would react.
