**Bio:** Zeisan was the oldest son of his family and always protected his brothers from everything he could. His Father was a brilliant, high ranking, tactics officer for a privet army. Zeisan quickly picked up on his fathers tactics and spent a lot of his time studding armor weak points and weapon weaknesses. However during one of his parents trips the Mando's invaded his home world and easily took over. During the attack Zeisan tried to defend his home however during the cross fire his youngest brother was killed. After that Zeisan lost it and started killing any solider he could see. He managed to take out two soldiers before he knocked out. They quickly noticed his quick mind and sharp eyes and put him through their training to break him. After the training the higher up quickly picked up on his sharp eyes and combat skills. That all it took to get him out in battlefield and in charge of his own men. It took him no time to make his way up the ranks and became a commando at the age of 25. By this time he had forgotten why he even join there ranks and just saw each mission as it was and nothing more.
All of that changed when he was ordered to help take over a planet by taking out a military base before the main force landed. While on the mission his team easily took out any resistance that was in his way, but when he made it to the command center and killed everyone he noticed the bodies that were at his feet. He looked at what was left of his family and everything came back to him. He quickly killed the rest of his team and made sure he was no where to be found.
