**Name:** Trae
**Race:** Near-Human (Prandian)
**World:** Prandia
**Age:** 19
**Gender:** Male
**Appearance:** Tall, tan, and blonde with warm hazel eyes, Trae seems to have the looks and bearing of a somebody rather than a nobody, but it seems that a nobody is what he is. He usually wears the overalls and trappings of a mechanic. Still, he is no scruffy nerfherder, and barring a few smudges he may have missed Trae usually looks presentable enough, with clean nails and skin and his hair tied neatly back.
**Personality:** Trae is handsome, confident, eloquent, and charming; most who meet him can hardly believe he is a person of such non-importance. But he seems happy enough, at least outwardly. In more private moments he can be maudlin, but the company of friends always seems to revitalise his flagging spirits.
**Abilities:** Trae is a charming and skilful speaker, and has competitive abilities as a marksman and a fencer. He is capable as a mechanic.
**Weapons:** heavy blaster pistol, vibrofoil, archaic foil (which he never removes from its sheath).
**Bio:** Trae is like many in the *Star Wars* galaxy - he has a past that haunts him. His, it has to be said, is probably up there among the top few reasons to run from your past. He is in fact the exiled Prince of Prandia, Amrahil Elessin, wanted for the murder of his father by poisoning. In fact, he did no such thing, framed (not that he knows it) by his younger brother and the now Crown Prince's accomplices.
Fortunately for Amrahil, he had many friends in the Capital who believed in his innocence and his escape was arranged and implemented before he could be executed. He is now on the run, and goes by whatever name and made up background strike his fancy. Currently he is Trae, a charming warrior who occasionally fights on duelling circuits, but spends most of his time as a mechanic's assistant.
