<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Undiscovered Path</span>
**Name:** Jace Cloudspinner
**Race:** Human
**World:** Iruju - Outer Rim
**Age:** 23
**Gender:** Female
**Appearance:** Sporting shoulder length blonde hair, Jace is slim at her 5'7" stature. When she looks at you with her green eyes. you get the sense she can knows what you are thinking. Wearing a black tanktop and pants, a blaster rifle is usually found slung across her back.
**Abilities:** Jace is an excellent pilot, with her Force enhanced reflexes and quick wit she could probably out do some of the most seasoned pilots. A natural telepath, she has yet to find a way to completely control her abilities.
**Flaws:** Due to her telepathic tendencies, when overwhelmed or placed in a situation with a vast amount of sentients Jace may find herself lacking the control she needs to keep a sense of herself and has a mental breakdown. Jace also can have a bit of a temper. Being quick to anger she often takes awhile to cool, but when she does the event is generally forgotten.
**Weapons:** Assualt rifle
**Bio:**
Jace has always been a wanderer. Ever since she was young she could never stay in one place for too long. Some believed it was because she was driven by a wanderlust. Those she actually allowed close realized it was because she had a remarkable gift. One that usually isolated her from those around her.
Growing up on an Outer Rim world called Iruiji (Republic colonized world) she escaped the Jedi's notice. The Mandolorians left her world practically desolate during the war. A conflict which killed both her parents in the end. Her mother, Francesca was killed during the Mandalorian's bombardment of Iruji when Jace was about six. Her father, Jorus Dravvad was killed during a cargo run for Republic forces. Not knowing why she had these abilities and disdaining the growing apathy and distrust those around her exhibited, she left her home. Using the ship she had inherited from her father she set out on her own. Purchasing a disgruntled repair droid, Crash, they go from port to port, trading goods and on Jace's part staying away from the bulk of habitations.<div style="text-align: right;">

Once belonging to Jace's father,Jorus Dravvad, the ship has obviously seen better days. The once brilliant silver and blue paint scheme has been chipped away over the last few years of use and disrepair. When Jorus had died, the ship had fallen under control of the Republic who had used it for their purposes till one day Jace arrived to claim her inheritance from her father. Not having the heart to just sell the ship, she fixed it up as best she could, buying the droid Crash to assist. Though more often than not, the both feel like there's always more to be done.
Jorus had modified the ship. No longer having the med bay, it was converted into a private cabin for the captain and the two crew dormitories now contain more living space holding two crew per dorm.
An ad-hoc medical bed was inserted into the wall of the communications room, to be folded out when needed. Medical supplies are kept in cabinets spread out along the opposite wall.
**Weapons:**
Double Laser Cannon (pilot)
Quad Laser Cannon, heavy (gunner)
Blaster Cannon Docking Gun (co-pilot)
