The purpose of this section is to provide each a player a place to post their character profile. This is highly recommended as like keeping a character sheet for a game, it will give you something to come back and reflect on when you post. When writing up a profile be as detailed as possible.
Please limit one thread per player, any mulitple threads by a single player will be combined. Please don't cause extra hassle for the moderators.
Keep in mind the following is a basic character profile. Some fields may be ommited depending on the game and the GM/creator of the game may request more.
**Name:**
**Race:**
**World:**
**Age:**
**Gender:**
**Appearance:**
**Personality:**
**Abilities:**
**Flaws:**
**Weapons:**
**Bio:**
