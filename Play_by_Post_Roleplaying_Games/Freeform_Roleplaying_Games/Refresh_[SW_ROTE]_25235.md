# Refresh [SW: ROTE]

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-09 15:24:56)

The first few moments of seeing Andy's new appearance are filled with silence - not even the droid Jason Drexler, usually quick with sarcasm, can find words. Sera, Jason's mechanic and love interest (such as it is), just stares with mouth open wide.
"**…Right. Well then. What's the plan?**"
Eventually the party is able work out a satisfactory arrangement where Andy will accompany Jason and Sera to the Jawa sandcrawler in hopes of obtaining more information about Jason's past - and most probably his future - after dropping Jedi Marina Cloudspinner close to her friends' location. Andy bids her farewell and, being aware of her connection to the Force adds: "**I believe the Force has big things in store for you before the end, Marina Numa. We *will* meet again!**" She hears quick burst of Binary as the blue-eyed "Celestial Ambassador to Humanity" winks at B3, Marina's recently-acquired drone companion, and the ship's ramp retracts. It's silent engines are more felt than heard as its alien silhouette drops below the Tatooine horizon.
Marina stands within sight of Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi's hideaway, where her friends Joran Nor and Kitkatta await her. Twin suns glare down from high overhead but a gentle breeze blows across the hot desert sands, beckoning a mixture of memories and thoughts of the future.

This is the start of a closing session for Marina Numa (Alicia) and for now is only open to her, despite what the "rules" say about this thread. As time progresses I may allow other players to chime in.
Alicia - if you could include a link in a spoiler to Marina's old sheet so I can refresh my memory that'd be great. Feel free to add/edit as you like. I'm not holding you to it per se, I just need to jog my memory about the character. All the stuff on Iruji would be nice too. I didn't want to get too far ahead of you but you're welcome to write as little or as much as you like.

The dry heat washes over the young Jedi as she shades her eyes against the blaring suns, watching as the strange ships disappears into the distance. Turning her face to the hideout she sighs. It seemed it was becoming habit to watch ships leave without her. At least this time she knows she has a way off and has friends waiting for her. Shrugging of her jacket she uses it to shade her head as she walks toward the entrance. From the pocket, B3 pops out and after a childish sounding coo, returns to its hiding spot. With a sigh she trudges onward toward her friends' camp.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-12 05:57:56)

The sand crunches with every step, a lonely sound somehow, despite the ample daylight and B3's presence. Marina approaches to within a few meters of the cliffside hideout when the hatch suddenly slides open and a familiar Wookie youngling comes running out to greet her. The initial words are left untranslated thanks to B3's late arrival from the jacket pocket but the intent is clear: Kitkatta is glad to see her friend.
"**Mr. Jax…I mean… *Joran*,**" Kit says solemnly, obviously now aware of her rescuer's true identity, "**He told me all about what happened. I'm not sure I understand it but it sounded exciting and since you're alright - I knew you *would* be - now we can finally tell you what *we* found!**"
Behind Kit stands Jedi Knight Joran Nor, leaning against the rock face and clearly amused by the Wookie's behavior. Being cramped up in underground tunnels and hidden compartments was pretty routine for Kitkatta these last few years but it didn't mean she had to like it. Her curious mind and restless youth hated the confines and, truth be told, Joran was glad to get outside too. He'd spent the time since Marina left for Mos Eisley scouring the Holonet for any leads on Commander Chayse's whereabouts and hadn't turned up much. Given the decidedly biased reports glorifying Imperial victories in "capturing" Jedi since Palpatine's come to power, silence on the issue at hand was not very comforting - namely whether Chayse had any idea where the *Nova* and its crew were.

### **Alicia** (2012-05-17 16:47:45)

Mairna can't help but smile at the exuberance of the young Wookie. "**I'm eager to hear it,**" the young woman says, squeezing the Wookie's shoulder. Turning the child around, she starts them toward the cave eager to get in the shelter and out of the twin suns. Drawing closer to the cave she gives Joran a nod in greeting before moving past him. After getting a cup of water, Marina takes a seat and relaxes in the cooler air. "**I did fine out one thing. My bounty hunter friend is planetside, or at least was a couple days ago which makes me think he didn't follow us here.**" she pauses her report, knowing Kitkatta was probably eager to share what the learned. "**So what'd you find out about Chayse?**"

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-18 06:43:31)

"**He got *fired!***" exclaims Kit, eyes wide and arms gesticulating wildly.
"**Well, that's not *exactly* true…**" interrupts Joran, chuckling. "**He was demoted - there's a difference. Whether it's in our favor or not remains to be seen. He was reassigned to survey duty somewhere here in the Outer Rim. If what you say is true about the Whiphid then it's unlikely they know we're here, and Master Kenobi has remained undetected for sometime anyway. No, I think we're safe for the moment. The real question is what to do next - while Chayse may not be breathing down our necks, the Emperor isn't sitting still. Cries can be heard in the Force daily and Jedi will soon be all but extinct. It's not very safe out there for *any* of us.**"
Joran's speech keeps level but Marina picks up the nuance. The Empire had been steadily killing or capturing Wookies for a while now and operations had extended beyond just their homeworld of Kashyyyk. While the two Humans could probably disguise themselves and blend into a crowd, Kitkatta was far less likely to go unnoticed.
"**I thought we were going to your secret world…?**" asks Kit, her words less pleading and more disappointed. For all the show and big talk she was still a youngling and secret adventures appealed to her, even if danger was certain. She was, after all, in the company of two Jedi and practically one herself.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I think that's about right - did we say a year after Order 66? So like 18-17BBY?

</details>

Joran waits patiently for Marina's response, wanting to make sure she was still committed to traveling to Iruji. There were plenty of other things for outlaw Jedi with an invisible ship to do - not the least of which is to consult with Master Kenobi about others in need of help. Joran had done some other research on the side while Marina was in Mos Eisley and if pressed he'd admit a desire to return to *The Cleft* just to check on his people but that was as equally as dangerous as bringing the Empire to an undefended world. The Antarian Rangers could probably use some help too, if there were any left. He preferred to leave it up to Marina if only because he wanted to avoid making her feel like a tag-along.

### **Alicia** (2012-09-02 10:00:17)

Marina can't help but smile at Kit's child-like enthusiasm. "**We will be,**" she says, looking over at Joran. Dragging a youngling across the galaxy, especially a Wookie youngling on the cusp of learning her powers, wasn't an optimal situation. While she didn't mind using the dessert planet as a base of operations for whatever plans they decided to implement, a planet which had managed to keep its existence a secret for many generations had a certain appeal. There was also her own personal reasons for wishing to return, a promise to keep.
"**I think Iruji should be our next stop and then after that, see who else we can bring back.**"

### **BWS2K** (2012-09-02 23:57:31)

"***Yay!***" is all Kit can manage, her excitement about the journey so obvious that B3 doesn't even bother with a translation. He merely logs the expression for later reference. Kit throws her hairy little arms around Marina with a display of surprising strength.
Joran, however, remains cautiously optimistic. He'd worked with a lot of Imperials in the last few years at the *Cleft* and Chayse didn't strike him as a danger to be easily dismissed. The Empire seemed to be fueled by equal parts hate and secrets, and seeking refuge on a "secret" planet presented an irony that wasn't lost on him. Still - the combined pressures of being a businessman and hiding his Force sensitivity had begun to take its toll on Joran. He rather enjoyed being in the company of another Jedi and not having to be so enigmatic about his true self. The last few weeks had been a welcome change of pace.
"**Never argue with a Wookie, I guess - no matter how small! We'll get to packing right away. We can be ready in…**" Joran considers what in the hideaway actually belongs to them, "**…a couple minutes?**" he chuckles. There's a little tidying up to be done for sure but Master Kenobi would understand a quick departure and the *Nova* had been kept ready. Kit finally releases Marina and runs past Joran to finish the cleaning as quickly as possible. Her enthusiasm doesn't seem to fade as she moves quickly about the small space rearranging pillows and equipment, storing a few dishes, and generally straightening things up.
Jedi Knight Joran Nor watches from the doorway, amused and encouraged about the future. He sends Marina a simple impression that might be worded as "*Must be nice…*" that begins with a light-hearted emotion but ends with a genuine sense of camaraderie and gladness. It's accompanied by a knowing glance and a warm smile.
Marina sees Kit stop suddenly, looking confused for a moment, then pointing at the pair of Jedi with narrowed eyes: "**Hey! You're doing it again, aren't you? I can tell…**" For a single moment she seems to have a more mature air about her, something both Joran and Marina can sense through years of listening to the Force. They catch a brief glimpse of an older Kit, powerful and experienced in both battle and the grasp of her Force abilities. It's gone just as quickly though, lost in the enthusiasm of youth.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I had a thought - we're headed to Iruji, did you want to plan something for then? I can have something happen in transit or whatever but I feel like you should be the one to lead the story once we get there. I don't mind using Joran and Kit at all but I think I may introduce a third character whenever it seems appropriate - or maybe when we switch leading, depending on what you had in mind - so I can have someone a little more concrete than ***Joran Nor, GM-created Jedi Knight who doesn't have a character sheet!*** I never had it in mind to really, he's just sort of the catch-all narrative guy.

### **Alicia** (2012-09-03 14:07:56)

Returning Joran's smile she watches the Wookie as she straightens up the cavern, putting it to rights as if they had never been. Marina knew how her fellow Jedi felt, though he had needed to hide far longer than she. It was nice, however, to not have to hide who she really was, and soon nearly all her secrets would be revealed. A tightness begins to form in her chest at the thought, but she quickly pushes away the anxiety. Too long she had lived with the fear of discovery and she knew it had begun to unbalance her. There was only so long one could live like that before they snapped and that was no way to live.
Marina meets Joran's gaze as his directed emotions washes over her. The touch serves to empty her of the rest of her reservations. If anyone were to find a home on Iruji, it should be these two.
Kit's admonishments bring her out of her reverie and she tosses a laugh as she moves toward the young Wookie. "**Don't worry, Kit. I think our reveries would just bore you.**" Picking up a blanket from pile the youngling had yet to fold, she makes quick work of straightening it. "**I think that's it.**" Taking a look around she makes sure they haven't left anything, not that they had brought much to begin with.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ya, I'll take control once we get to Iruji, so till then... Do what comes to mind :P

"**The one good thing about traveling lightly - it doesn't take long to pack…**" says Joran, making light of the forced-nomadic lifestyle they've all been living as of late. His estimate wasn't that far off though, and they're all aboard the *Nova* and running through the prep stages within the hour. Sensors pick up an inbound craft and a glance out of the starboard viewports confirms a single speeder bike on approach. Before anyone has a chance to get to upset, however, it turns out to be Obi-Wan Kenobi.
"**Master Kenobi! Come to see us of, have you?**"
"**I do try to see my guests more than *once* before they leave, Joran. It's part of being a good host you know - something you won't find many of around here I'm afraid.**"
Kit is happy to see the Jedi Master as well and is visibly trying to restrain herself from another trademark Wookie hug. That sort of behavior probably wouldn't be proper for a Jedi, so she settles with taking her place on the ramp and giving deliberate bow. It's returned with as much solemnity as it was given and Obi-Wan manages to hide his grin from the youngling - but both Joran and Marina notice it all the same.
"**And something told me you might need these…** he says, reaching into the back of the bike. He retrieves a small unmarked parcel and hands it to Joran. The gift is clearly unexpected, judging by the look on his face, but Joran accepts the package with gratitude. "**Thank you, Master, very much.**"
"**Yes, well, you better be off then! Safe travels!**" Kenobi replies, mounting the speeder bike once more. "**And may the Force be with you!**" And with that final comment, he waves to them all and heads off across the sands once more.<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

A few hours later the *Nova* stops to recalculate its next set of jump coordinates. Traveling in a series of short micro-jumps is the best way to make sure no one is following and it's a valid precaution to take even if your ship can turn invisible. Joran, Marina, and even Kit have been somewhat preoccupied with checking the ship's systems since leaving Tatooine and now finally have time to open Jedi Master Kenobi's strange gift...
"**Well let's see what we've got here! Kit - do the honors?**"
Joran's words have barely left his lips when Kit's Wookie claws make short work of the simple parchment wrapping. There's a tiny silver box, only a few centimeters across with an odd symbol on it. Joran seems to recognize it and picks it up but doesn't open it, choosing rather to tuck it away for later. The bulk of the package was obviously some sort of fabric - that much anyone would have guessed even before it was opened. It was in fact, however, some Jedi robes elegantly tailored for a certain Wookie youngling. The same Wookie who, despite her earlier success at self-control, lets fly with a display of emotion accompanied by ecstatic vocalizations that not even B3 is able to catch all of. Suffice it to say that she is quite pleased.
As Kit lifts up the robes and runs to get changed, Marina sees a small data card lying in the center of the wrappings.
"**Looks like we all got something…?**" says Joran, as if the other two items were all he had guessed at.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, I think that's right. I thought about it all night at work and I do have a plan for the next bit but, well, you know how it is. I get to typing and end up with something entirely different. I was originally going to give the robes to Joran because I don't think he's worn them yet but that just didn't sit well. Obviously Kit would go bonkers over them and so it worked out that way. I have an idea for the data card's contents but if you have anything *you'd* like it to be instead, that's fine. Enjoy your day! ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

Marina is no stranger to the nomadic life. Her time with the Jedi since she was a young girl consisting of traveling from planet to planet for her Master's next lesson. With Silas it had continued as he performed his duties in the service of the ExploCorps. Traveling had never bothered her - particularly with all the wonders each place revealed - till she had spent a large amount of time on Iruji and learned the potential of belonging in one place. Iruji had become her home; one she had leave for a time.
Saying good-bye to Master Kenobi with a traditional bow and then informally waves to him as he disappears into the distance, briefly she wonders why the Jedi master had chosen this dust bowl as his refuge. She, however, doesn't dwell on it as she boards the ship, tossing her rucksack from her brief trips onto her bed before making her way to the cockpit to help with the ascent through the atmosphere and the subsequent micro jump. The series of micro jumps were going to be hard on the engines and she begins to formulate a checklist of required maintenance checks she will have to have Kit and BeeDee help her with.
Now taking a break from maintenance on the hyperdrive, she watches with amusement watches as the Wookie makes her hasty exit to put on the new robes. While she looks curiously at the symbol she catches a glance of, she leaves it be seeing as it has some meaning to Joran. The datachip, however, she takes and moves over to one of the computer consoles to access it's contents. "**Maybe he'found out something about our Imperials or the bounty hunter,**" she supplies, not really sure what the Master would have found they hadn't already learned. Something from his contacts perhaps.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-09-05 06:46:07)

The ship's computer accesses the data chip easily and displays its simple contents. It's just an address on Nar Shaddaa, with an accompanying text - a quote from the Jedi code:
*There is no emotion; there is peace.*
Obi-Wan Kenobi is many things but most of all he is a Jedi Master. It wasn't his tendency to give up the role of teacher so easily and Marina can only guess what the message could mean. Certainly the robes were meant for Kit, and Joran knew the box was his - this information must have some significance to Marina specifically. At least Obi-Wan thought so. Something in the Force confirms this to her, though any further details remain elusive for the present.
Joran wasn't about to be nosy, and either way a chirp came from the navicomp signaling they were ready to resume hyper-travel. He left for the cockpit to initiate the next jump.

How does combat work in this style - do we just type it out as we like? It may be important in the near future... ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

### **Alicia** (2012-09-05 10:22:19)

*There is no emotion; there is peace.* Marina reads again. It was the only clue to what the address would lead her to. Something personal, something that would evoke an emotional response. Putting the address to memory, she removes the chip from the console and stores it away on her bracer. The only way to know for sure was to head to the hive, however, she wasn't eager to drag a young Wookiee along even though she had a feeling Kit wouldn't want to be left behind. *It's going to be safer where we're going by far. And she'll have children her age and the freedom to develop her abilities without the Empire looming over her shoulder.* With a soft laugh she realizes those were similar reasons for a prior resolution. Heading toward the engine room for a final inspection her thoughts shift to what Kenobi was trying to tell her.
While she'd been on Nar Shaddaa a few times over the last couple years it had mainly been for business. Her work during the war would technically count as espionage and the Hutt controlled planet was a mine for information if a Jedi knew how to keep her head down, her ears open and knew how to ask the right questions. It had also often served as a drop zone for couriers on numerous occasions when communication channels were too dangerous to use. One such courier she had found rather intriguing and, well, one thing led to another. The young Jedi was of like-minded agreement with the circumstances and they soon parted ways. Being just a few short weeks before the end of the war, the young man's well being had often come into her thoughts. It was likely he had been at the temple at the time, and now, like many of her Jedi kin, was dead.
Her thoughts distracting her from her work, she's brought back in full when a spark from an exposed conduit singes her fingers. Cursing loudly, she leaves the confines for the medical kit in the main room and a salve to ease the burn. As she administrates to the small, yet painful wound, she can feel the hyperdrive engines kick in toward the destination of their next micro jump. *Won't be too much longer now*, she thinks.

For combat we can continue to use saga rules since that's how this game started. Otherwise we can just leave it up to description and logic.

### **BWS2K** (2012-09-05 16:36:00)

A few restful hours later the *Nova* drops out of its last micro-jump. The likelihood that anyone could have managed to follow them here from Tatooine was quite remote. All that remained was the final jump to the Iru system and to make planetfall.
That - and navigating through the violent space battle that they seem to have emerged in the middle of.
"**Marina! Kit! We've got trouble!**" Joran shouts over the ship's speakers. Cloaking would need to wait a few minutes after a hyperjump to engage and until then that made them vulnerable. The *Nova* wasn't designed for combat.
*This could be bad…*
A quick glance at the sensor displays confirmed what he was seeing outside - at least a dozen small to medium-size vessels engaged in fierce fighting. Most likely it would be pirates - the Empire avoided using such tactics and few others even bothered to be this far out. Even as he watched, though, Joran saw a number of the ships disabled or destroyed in seconds. The fighters were well-coordinated and the transports too outgunned. The battle had probably only begun a few minutes earlier, meaning there was plenty of fight left to bring to the *Nova* as soon as it was spotted.
The target ship seems to have been an L4000 transport, currently in the process of being disabled and boarded. A pair of the M3-A Scyk fighters broke off and made for the *Nova* as others made short work of the transports escorts.

### **Alicia** (2012-09-05 17:16:34)

At Joran’s announcement of trouble she forsakes her usual position in engineering and jumps into the gunnery controls calling out to the rest of the ship as she straps in. “**BeeDee, Kit, keep the shields up!**”
The shields on the *Nova* she knows are vast and between BeeDee and Kit she trusts to keep the shields up long enough for Joran to pilot them out of the crossfire. Until then she hopes to dissuade the fighters that they weren’t an easy target. They certainly couldn’t outgun them, but maybe they could outlast them long enough to get away.
Flipping the controls of the station into a ready position she takes a look at the targeting sensors and the fighters closing in. Never having been an expert gunner, she knew she was a bit out of her element. Who was she kidding? She’d probably be able to hit her target thanks to the advanced computer systems Joran had the foresight to install. Setting her scope for the closest of the fighters she lets her senses guide her.
The shot glances off the shields of one of the fighters, doing little to deter the slower vessel from continuing its pursuit

Staying around to engage the enemy was simply not an option, but Joran was thankful to have Marina on the guns all the same. The displays showed an estimated time until cloaking could be engaged of nearly a minute - a long time when you're dodging fire.
"**Keep doing what you're doing - we should be able to cloak in about sixty seconds!**" he shouts to Marina over the sound of the engines. In the back, Kit was staying busy monitoring outputs from several different systems. She was a youngling and not a whole lot of help but every bit counted and she knew more than she looked.
The *Nova* twisted to avoid another volley of shots and Joran tried his best to keep his distance.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Have fun - I'm not going with actual rounds here so if you want to take more than one shot that's fine, but then maybe give the bad guys a shot or two as well? We'll play this out until they're dead or we're bored - either way, I'm not interested in rescuing anyone anymore really. Only the two fighters are interested in us for the time being, and we'll be cloaked before others would join. Just getting away will be good enough. We'll figure that all out on Iruji.

</details>

### **Alicia** (2012-09-07 14:43:05)

Strapped into the gunnery seat, Marina doesn't have to worry about losing her balance as Joran dodges the two fighters' shots; the distance slowly widening between them. Her jaw clenches with determination when Joran gives the countdown till they can cloak and be free and clear of pursuit from anymore pirates.
Firing at every chance she can her second shot glances off her target's shields as it dodges out of the way once more. As she re-calibrates and the groan of the engines grows louder as Joran pushes more out of the engines to increase the speed, the fighters fire back. Joran's Jedi instincts are however sharp as ever and he manages to angle the ship just enough for the fighters' joined shots to miss.
Before they pull away completely from the pursuing fighters, Marina takes her time setting up a final shot. Her patience is rewarded as she hits the engine ports of one of the fighters. It sparks in flame-less mutiny as the damaged engines slows the fighter to a crawl and its companion sticks with his wingman.
Marina smiles as she watches the two fighters get out paced by the faster Nova. Before she gets into her self congratulations she hollers toward Joran in the cockpit, "**Nice flying. Anymore pursuit?**"

### **BWS2K** (2012-09-07 20:57:39)

Marina's question is answered as the stars outside blur and the ship lurches into hyperspace. The adrenaline wears off in a few moments and she makes her way back down from the gunnery position where Joran passes her briskly with a concerned look on his face. Suddenly she feels it - the fear. *Kit*.
That sort of maneuvering wouldn't have ordinarily put such an audible strain on engines but Joran was trying to lose their pursuers while having the navicomp calculate the jump coordinates on the fly. The departure point could be reached quicker than waiting on the cloaking and so he didn't mind taking a few hits if it meant a faster getaway, but Kitkatta was in the back without any knowledge of the enemies or the tactic. For her, the situation had seemed much worse and even very brave younglings are still younglings. Marina respects their privacy and after a few long moments the feelings subside somewhat and Kit heads to her room while Joran returns to the cockpit.
"***That*… I wasn't expecting. We should be on Iruji in an hour or so.**" he replies with a sigh. "**The ship looks alright though - thanks. Can't say I've ever had the chance to use the shields - or the *guns* - like that…**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Tag! You're it! I figure a Wookie youngling Force sensitive would have a breaking point and being attacked in space would probably be a good guess. I think I like Kit better than Joran as far as writing. ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

It's with a sigh of relief she leans back in her restraints as the stars stretch around the ship and it enters hyperspace. The relief turns into concern as Joran hastens past her and the reason becomes clear. While the young Wookie's bravery was unusual in one so young, it was easy to forget in such circumstances. The times were already causing the young girl to grow up far faster than was needed and, while she seemed eager, it took times like these to remind her elders.
The experience brought back the first time she had been in such a confrontation. After her initial years of training with Firith Ven on his remote world where Yoda had brought her too be taken as his Padawan they took to the stars. The clunker of a ship barely managed its first jump after years of unuse. Breaking down mid-way to their destination the Force had been with them in that they were in range of a trading world. Unfortunately for them, their first encounter with the traders ended up badly resulting in the two Jedi having to make a hasty retreat under fire.
Being just twelve the experience had left her shaken, but not irresolute.
Sitting in the cockpit, Marina's mind starts to wander; her thoughts already reaching the planet. Brought back to the here and now she looks over at Joran as he takes the pilot's seat. She nods as he speaks, having already looked over his calculations. "**I think you'd be surprised how much the Nova could take.**" For a moment Marina smiles with pride at how well the ship handled, but then she frowns as she glances back toward the cabinets for a moment. "**How is she?**" she asks, concerned.

"**She'll be okay I think. It's been a rough life for her so far. The slavery, the hiding - I don't think being shot at by fighter craft was anywhere on her 'to-do' list. She bounces back pretty quickly though.**"
*Of course that was just two of them… any more and I might have been a little upset myself…*
"**We're lucky raiders like that aren't interested in anything but easy pickings. I doubt they would have strayed too far from the others even if we hadn't jumped. I would've liked to have helped out but, well, we're not in the best of shape to take on a full raiding crew ourselves.**"
Joran does feel some remorse but what he says is true - it's unlikely they would have done anything but stir up more trouble for themselves. Discretion is the better part of valor, if not always the most popular.

"**It's likely we would have found ourselves in the same situation as them. Not to mention we're not equipped to be fighting pirates.**" she let's the thought trail out into silence as she turns to watch the stars streak by. If fighting the two fighters had rattled their young Wookie, who knew what a full onslaught with the pirates would do to her. "**Things could have gotten real bad**," she finishes and then she sighs deeply, the sound apparent that she didn't like it anymore than Joran did. Their days of helping people against the odds was pretty much over. There wouldn't be back up from Coruscant to help get them out, there was only each other.
Leaning on the armrest of her chair, her thoughts start to drift again and for once in a long while she starts thinking about the future. The possibilities were vast and her head starts to spin as she realizes that she has many choices to make. With a glance over at Joran, she idly wonders what plans he had already set into motion. It was all too soon to tell and it was his choice whether he stayed, but they seemed to have agreed Kit was better off on the peaceful world they were heading. At least until she was older and had been given the chance to have a childhood. Sitting up, she realizes she had been caressing the small coral pearl between her fingers, the pulsing from within drawing her attention to it finally. Lately she had been wearing the cord around her wrist so the pearl rested next to her pulse. Now the pulses were coming faster than usual and she sensed fear and pain.
Taking a deep breath, Marina has to force herself from not overreacting. "**Somethings wrong…**" is all she can say, but she's already taking a look at the navicomputer to check the countdown till they drop into realspace.

### **BWS2K** (2012-09-08 23:52:37)

Joran, too, sat deep in thought. He knew what Obi-Wan had given him without even opening the little box - it was probably something new to meditate on. Seeing each other so rarely meant that Jedi who had extensive experience with other cultures, or had learned something new in the ways of the Force, often did what they could to share it with others they met. Someday the Order would be restored and preservation of its accumulated knowledge would have been worth it. His folded his arms across his chest and lay back, staring at the ceiling of the cockpit with half-open eyes.
*Always the teacher…*
Time passed, though he wasn't sure how much, when Marina's comment roused him from his thoughts. Joran eyed her with cautious curiousity: "**…Wrong like what - with the ship?**"

---

### **Alicia** (2012-09-09 16:13:29)

Marina shakes her head, dispelling Joran's concerns the problem was with the ship. "**On Iruji,**" she explains, her fingers anxiously rubbing the small pearl. Once she found the gem, a Life Stone connected to a child's - her child's- essence, a boon. But now as she sensed the terror, Marina felt helpless. The worst part was not knowing whether it was just a childhood calamity or something much worse. *If it was an incident I wouldn't be sensing fear. Not for this long, at least.* A child with people around to soothe her wouldn't be afraid for long, particularly not one as young with the blessing to bounce back from anything.
"**Something has happened to my daughter,**" she reveals levelly, finding a calm only possible thanks to the training as a Jedi. Freaking out, she knows, won't help anyone, especially not her little girl. It doesn't, however, prevent her from watching the countdown with a hawk's gaze.
As the moments count down and the engine prepares to release them into realspace, Marina glances over at Joran. "**There will be a small fleet protecting the fourth planet and snubs patrolling the system. If all is well, the fleet should be holding position in Iruji's shadow.**"
Having set the comm channels to the frequency she knew would be in use, Marina immediately picks up the chatter between the bored pilots on patrol. Bored up until the Nova drops in between the fifth and sixth planets of the system. The sensors at work, and knowing what to look for, she points out the two fighters using the planets' shadow as cover. "**Head for the fourth planet… Don't stop,**" she directs and as the Nova passes the fighters to begin to follow at a safe distance.

Joran angles the *Nova* on the most direct approach vector to Iruji and follows Marina's instructions on where to land. So far so good...
"**I don't sense anything out of the ordinary… still expecting trouble?**"
He knew the Force could be fickle at such times. Not having ever been to Iruji, much less ever met Marina's family, Joran wouldn't necessarily detect a disturbance so specific. If there was a situation, however small, it would almost certainly require some extra finesse - even with Marina on board he and Kit were still outsiders. They would need to tread lightly until they had a feel for things locally.

### **Alicia** (2012-09-11 00:57:09)

"**Nothing seems to be out of place up here,**" Marina says, watching as the fighters continued to follow at a distance. They wouldn't show any hostile action unless provoked and the young Jedi intended on announcing her intentions soon enough. Drawing closer to the planet, Marina opens a channel to the planet below in a wide spectrum transmission the orbiting fleet would even pick up on. The channel crackled static for a long while as Marina waits impatiently for the recipient to answer.
Finally a gruff, male voice answers, an expression on Marina's face indication recognition and sudden displeasure. "**Who is this? Who bothers the Elder?**" Of course she should have known *he* would answer. It was unfortunate perhaps she didn't have the patience for dealing with his hostility toward her.
"**This is Marina, I would speak to *my grandmother*.**" She could him drawing breath for a dissmissal, but before he could give it, the comm changes hands. A younger, feminine voice speaks out, her tone full of grief "**Marina… Rina, you should come quickly. The children… they were taken.**"
For a moment Marina's heart feels like it's stopped beating and she forces herself to speak. "**Jacqueline… was Nadia…. was she…?**" A sob is given as a response and then it quietens as she moves away. "**The landing platform is open,**" the gruff voice says curtly and ends the transmission.
Sent some signal the fighters which had been following at a safe distance close in, taking an escort position on the Nova as it approaches the planet's atmosphere. In the long moments it takes from them to reach orbit, Marina stares out at the planet fighting to control the worry that was now threatening to consume her. Still needing to direct Joran on where to go, she pulls herself together and points out the landing platform at the base of the mountain boundary separating the northern and southern continents.

### **BWS2K** (2012-09-11 07:41:45)

Joran hears the brief exchange and guesses at what isn't said. He focuses on the landing sequence in silence however, respectful - and cautious - of circumstances.
Kit makes her way solemnly to the cockpit, her first appearance outside of her room since the narrow escape from the fighters. She has shed her new padawan robes and is holding a small blanket around her shoulders. Her growing sensitivity to the Force and fledgling friendship with Marina both give her a vague insight to the situation at hand - or at least the emotions of the moment. "**…What's going on?**" she asks quietly.
Joran answers in like tone: "**We're landing, Kit. This is Iruji.**" He leaves the rest to Marina, if she so chooses, to fill in.

### **Alicia** (2012-09-11 22:57:21)

Closing her eyes, Marina attempts to push away all the thoughts that begin to overwhelm her brought on by countless possibilities and no real answers. Her maternal instincts wage war with her years of Jedi training, but finally the latter wins out and once again a calm washes over her. Though as Kit comes up front she realizes it has probably come to late.
Schooling her expression, Marina turns to give Kit a reassuring smile, though she's not quite sure how well it comes across. "**Why don't you go strap in? The ride down is going to be a bit rough.**" Marina suggests turning back to the console in front of her. The young woman didn't see the need to worry the youngling more than she was already thanks to the growing rapport between them. Besides, once they got to the surface, Kit would quickly learn what was happening.
After her initial direction and coordinates in hand, Joran would have little trouble locating the landing pad sheltered by the mountain's cliff face. Already two ships make use of it - an older Dynamic-class freighter and a two person starfighter of an unfamiliar design. Beginning to gather around the landing site at a safe distance, a group of people huddle together against the winds the ship kicks up.

"**…okay…**" replies Kit, obviously not convinced by Marina's false calm but unwilling to push the issue further. She settles into one of the fold-out seats near the front of the ship and secures her harness, blanket folded beside her.
The *Nova* bucks in stereotypical fashion as it sets down on the pad with a thud. All landing systems were at optimum and the cooldown cycle was under way. Joran holds off on initiating stealth mode though, for obvious reasons.
"**And that's it. We're here!**" he says, with a half-hearted attempt at cheer. He's not even buying it himself but the journey had felt rather long.

### **Alicia** (2012-09-17 20:10:55)

On any normal visit, Marina knows she would be ecstatic to have finally arrived home at last, but knowing a trial lay before her dampened the feeling. The crowd she noticed had gotten larger and they huddled together watching the ship. Unhooking the restraints, she comments, "**Looks like you're about to meet my extended family. Most of them anyways.**" A woman with graying blonde hair was meandering toward the ship trailed by a man who had his an arm wrapped protectively around a young woman.
Brushing past Kit, she motions for the youngling to follow along. After lowering the ramp, Marina steps out into the midday sun. The warm air hits her as she walks down the ramp, her breath drawing in the sweet, fresh air untouched by industrialization. With a glance behind her to see if Kit and Joran were coming she steps off the ramp and heads towards the small group now just several paces from the bottom.
The woman standing in front appears to be in her late 60s, her long blonde hair, which hangs freely, is streaked with gray. She gives Marina a kind smile and then watches with curiosity as a Wookie youngling and Joran follow behind. Behind the woman, a middle-aged man glares at the new arrivals all the while holding the weeping young woman who is no older than Marina. Farther away a small crowd of people stand gathered, some still holding the farm tools they had been using before being drawn to the gathering.
The mountain looms above them, and in the distance Marina can see the tall trees which grow quickly here on the other side of the valley maintained as farmland. The landing pad had been placed on an elevated portion of the valley, high enough that the winter flood waters wouldn't impede the use of the pad. Further up the plateau Marina knows the estate resided, overlooking all.

### **BWS2K** (2012-09-19 08:23:59)

Joran and Kit aren't quite shoulder to shoulder, but they stand together at the top of the ramp and allow Marina to meet the natives first. Aside from the fact that neither of them know official protocol, at least some of these faces are familiar to her. Joran had chosen from among his more casual clothes to indicate nothing about his true identity as a Jedi or successful businessman - the uncertainty of just how far the Empire may have broadcast his status as a fugitive still not worth risking just yet. His eyes roamed the crowd nonchalantly as he gave his best performance as just another pilot with fast ship.
The air was tense with emotion and Kit was still trying to grapple with how to process it all. The events of the last few months had certainly matured her beyond her age and while still a youngling, she had experienced many things that, under other circumstances, any one of which would have been traumatic. She wore her simple utility belt and let her hands hang free at her sides. The trees in the distance brought back distant memories, just stills and emotions really, of more pleasant times. Her earliest, in fact. Of course that didn't last long once Wookies became prime slaves throughout the galaxy, but she couldn't help but wonder if she'd have the chance to explore the forest much.

I removed the part with Karn because it didn't really flow like I wanted but I don't want to hold you up any. I'll keep up with Joran and Kit. I'm going on the premise that Karn is a witness to this scene, though exactly how it plays out we'll just have to see. I wouldn't put him forward as a main character yet but you're welcome to mention him as a prompt if you like.

### **Alicia** (2012-10-18 14:45:51)

Marina's lightsaber swings from her belt as she bows respectfully to the older woman - there was no need for her to hide who she was here. Turning back to motion to her companions she provides a quick introduction - telling their welcoming party Kit and Joran were *friends* of hers - before turning back to the woman.
"**Elder Jaya Cloudspinner**," Marina provides for her friends' benefit. "**Isaac Cloudspinner and Jacqueline Tenson.**"
At the sound of her name, Jacqueline breaks away from her father and surprises Marina as she embraces her in search of comfort. Taken back only a moment, Marina does her best. She also attempts to ignore the disapproval evident on Isaac's face, but in the end can't help but to send him a look in return.
"**Rina, can you forgive me?**" Jacqueline balls between gasps, shoving bits of her long strawberry blonde hair behind her ears as she pulls away.
"**Course I can, but somebody better tell me soon what's going on.**" Marina's gaze goes to Jaya, but it's Jacqueline who chimes in first.
"**The mountain has betrayed us!**" she says hysterically. Isaac and Jaya are quickly at her side with Isaac easily catching the girl when Jaya places her finger on Jacqueline's forehead and urges her to sleep with the Force.
"**Her rest will be dreamless, your daughter will recover,**" Jaya reassures Isaac. "**I'll be in later.**"
Isaac nods, "**Thank you, Mother**," he responds before he carries the sleeping form down the hill past the others who had gathered with the arrival of the ship. Marina moves to stand next to the elder as they both watch the two retreating forms.
"**What happened on the mountain, Nana?**" Marina asks slowly.
The woman doesn't respond at first, looking back toward Marina's companions before looking down the hill again. "**Not here, child.**" Beckoning for them all to follow, she leads them toward the tree line and subsequently away from the mountain and the crowd of people gathered there.

Finally right? I actually didn't rewrite anything and I don't think it came out too silly. I wanted to leave room for reactions and such and leave an opportunity to land the ship to bring Karth in if you still want to use him.

Not a few pairs of eyes follow Joran and Kit as they descend the ramp behind Marina, but the two take it in stride. Joran knows how to conduct himself among new acquaintances well enough and Kit follows along, confident that Marina's word is sufficient to explain the presence of a hunted race. They bow politely in turn to Isaac, Jaya, and the young Jacqueline as they introduced. There's little time for any conversation, formal or otherwise, as the trio are beckoned away. As they walk to the treeline Joran reaches out cautiously with the Force to get a feel for any thoughts or emotions beyond the general alarm and concern, and to calm Kit as best he can manage. The two exchange a glance and he smiles to reassure her, as if to say "**Secrets, danger, and hysterics? You know the drill!**"
The Wookie youngling has less training in how to control her Force sensitivity and as such struggles with how to process all the raw emotion washing over her. Marina and Joran are of tremendous comfort to her but even they seem unaware of just how gifted she really is. The time spent on Tatooine and aboard the *Nova* wasn't wasted though, and she's able to maintain composure and grin back at Joran.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

No worries, that was great. I'm still trying to get a good feel for what's going through JnK's minds right now and I imagine it's probably somewhere between caution and curiosity - hence the lack of any substantial dialogue. Do me a favor and clue me in to some of the stuff they might be picking up, especially for Joran who is actively trying to get a sense of it, by way of Force sensitivity. Once conversation opens up in earnest however, they'll be fine. Have fun at the 'con!
P.S. Totally building up Kit to be crazy gifted. Not really sure exactly of the consequences. ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

### **Alicia** (2012-11-18 05:51:33)

The emotions on the hill are tense, and through the Force the worry laced fear is palpable. An imposing sense of dread has started to settle on the members of the group and hope is thin. Marina isn’t blind to the rampaging emotions but she bides her time in asking questions as the older woman takes them further from the cleared valley toward the looming forrest. Her destination because obvious as they draw closer to a small log built structure jutting out, yet still hidden among the tall trees. It’s not hard for the trained senses of the Jedi to determine the structure is empty.
With little flourish, Jaya opens the door and allows the others to proceed her. The structure inside consists of one large room, simply designed to be a waystation. A set of disheveled bunks and dishes with cooked food bear evidence whoever was residing here had left at a moments notice, and the still warm cup of caf an indicator it hadn’t been too long ago.
Taking a seat in one of the chairs at the table,Jaya indicates the others should join her. “**The Rangers left to search the Reaches,**” she explains at Marina’s questioning look.”**Only a few have remained on their current tasks. We’ll be undisturbed here for a time.**” For a long moment she turns to scrutinize Marina’s companions and the two have the sense the woman’s azure gaze, not so different from Marina’s, sees more than even the trained observer.
Finally she turns back to Marina apparently satisfied with what she’s seen. “**I trust with your timely arrival, you were already on your way home?**”
Marina nods.
The woman smiles, “**Even in this time of darkness, the Force still acts to balance itself. You all came when you were needed most.**”

### **BWS2K** (2012-11-19 10:13:43)

Kitkatta was content to follow the conversation quietly, leaving the big decisions to the adults. Joran listened intently however, picking up details in what was said - and unsaid.
"**If the Force has guided us here Elder Cloudspinner,**" Joran errs on the side of politeness in addressing Jaya, "**…and I, too, believe it has - it hasn't shown us our role. Perhaps you could tell us what exactly it is you would ask of us?**"
It seems odd at first, that he would be so willing to enter into a potentially dangerous situation with having had only a brief respite since what occurred on Tyrena. It was, however, more akin to what he was used to as a Jedi Knight and much more preferable to simply fleeing from the Empire. Here was a chance to really help, to really make a difference, and it felt good. Kit - ever a lover of adventure - was also excited, though she was exerting her maximum self-control to appear calm. She wasn't sure that it would be appropriate for a Padawan to act so emotional.

I'm fine with posting for now, considering your work schedule, but if we have the chance to chat stuff out at some point that'd be cool. I also think I'll just stick to Joran and Kit for now. Afterwards maybe I'll make a switch to a real character with stats and stuff, but this is good for now. I'll use the Jedi Knight template for Joran, with maybe some different powers. Kit will just be a nerfed version of that I think.

"Why, go after the children, of course. And to find this darkness which has taken hold. I can't think of anyone more capable for the task than two who have been Jedi trained." She gives Joran a mild smile. "Marina's connection with her daughter will serve as a compass."

### **Alicia** (2012-11-19 21:24:41)

Joran looks to Marina for a moment and nods in agreement. The Force connects all living beings and the strength of that connection only increases between loved ones, and the mother-daughter relationship was a powerful one indeed. Returning his gaze to Jaya, he continues: "**How many children were taken?**"
"Nine. Ranging from 1 to 12 years of age."
"I see. And the Reaches...that's a mountain range?"
"Whoever took them put Jacqueline and the other two caretakers to sleep." Jaya nods to Joran's question.
Marina speaks up "Specifically a clearing by a waterfall which the Cloudpinners find sacred."
"It is said it's where our first ancestor drew up the Accord which brought peace to our world," Jaya explains further. She couldn't resist giving a history lesson.
"Let's hope we can manage to settle things peacefully then." He looks back and forth between the to women, "You know the place well then, but they probably do too - are there any subtle approaches or should we just be direct? I wouldn't want a botched attempt at stealth to be misread..." Already Joran is considering options less like a businessman and more like a Knight of the Order.
Kit, for her part, wonders whether she'll be included in the task in some way. Jaya seemed to indicate she'd remain behind, which was fine by her, though what else she might do to help she couldn't begin to guess. Wookie younglings were especially good at some things, less so at many others.
"Well enough," Marina says. "I've been up there only a couple times. From this side of the mountain there's only one path to get there."
"That makes things a little easier. The Force has brought us this far, perhaps we can settle this peacefully after all. Has there been any contact with these people at all - a ransom demand or anything, and do we have any idea of who they are or where they might be from?" A Jedi wields knowledge as well as a lightsaber, and any information that might give an upper hand to Marina and Joran could prove crucial. Obviously they have some control over the Force, having put the children to sleep before taking them.
"We've reached out to the other families, specifically the Tensons who reside in the mountains, to see if any others have been taken, but thus far it has only been Cloudspinner children." Shaking her head to Joran's questions Jaya continues. "Thus far no demands have been made. And unless it is someone in the Families gone rogue, we don't know who might be doing this."
"Looks like you'll be taking lead then," he says to Marina, "You probably have a better chance of settling things if it's someone local. If it's not, then it won't make a difference."
Marina nods and then turns to Kit "All things considered, Kit. It would probably be best if you stay behind."
Expecting this, the Wookie simply nods. "Okay."
"Not to worry, there's plenty to get into around the estate."
"Don't worry Kit, I'm sure you'd just get bored with all the talking. I promise we won't have too much fun..." Joran gives her a wink of encouragement.
"Take whatever supplies you think you might need. I'm sure the Rangers won't mind."
Joran stands, ready to get started right away... "Well that's it then. Best we get going sooner rather than later. I might also have a couple things back at the Nova..."

His sentence trails off as he turns back and lets a hand rest on Kit's shoulder. They exchange a glance not fully understood by the women present and then Joran looks around the shelves assessing available supplies. His mental list complete he excuses himself and heads to the *Nova* to change and gather a few other things not already in the station.
"**See you soon Marina… and may the Force be with you.**" Kit adds solemnly. She waits patiently for instructions from Jaya about what to do next.

So that's pretty much how I wanted it to end, with Joran and Kit separated and ready to go. I'll have Joran change into some Jedi-ish robes and grab his lightsaber, as well as a light and... I dunno.

### **Alicia** (2012-11-20 11:02:37)

Marina takes a few moments as well to take stock of the supplies the Rangers had left behind. Finally she grabs a spare survival kit and after retrieving spare glow rods and extra food slings in on her back. Stopping in front of Kit, the young Jedi gives the Wookie youngling a hug. "**See you soon, Kit,**" Marina says with as much reassurance in her tone as she can muster. Bee-dee pops out of the carrier-like pouch and flies around the two young women's heads chirping and whooping its untranslatable, fast Binary. "**I think I'll leave Bee-dee here to keep you company.**" There's a hint of amusement in Marina's tone as she takes a step away from the small group. Goodbyes had never really been her thing, and to her they didn't feel entirely necessary. It wasn't like she wasn't planning on coming back, after all.
There's little else Marina needs from the Nova so she waits at the bottom of the ramp, though her attention has already started to focus on the path they are about to take. Glancing over at Joran when he finally joins her, she nods approvingly. Adjusting the straps of her pack she turns back to the path and then glances up at the sky. "**It will likely be dark in three hours here in the valley which gives us a couple more once we get up there. We can make it to the Reaches in the hour if we put in some speed.**" With a glance over at Joran once more her gaze asks whether he's ready.

### **Alicia** (2012-11-21 11:56:42)

Joran returns a short while later dressed in his Jedi robes and wearing a small brown pack carrying all the features of a survival kit and length of synthrope with a grapple. Hanging conspicuously at his side is his lightsaber. He has all the look of a true Jedi Knight, unafraid of a galaxy ready to extinguish his life at a moment's notice. Whether his appearance will help or hinder negotiations remains to be seen.
"You got it boss." Joran replies with a smile.
Marina shakes her head and then sets her sights on the path. With Force imbued speed she takes to the path, setting a quick but manageable pace that any other with the same skill could keep up.
Joran has no problem matching Marina's speed and the landscape passes by in a blur of browns and greens.
The trail has been worn by the hundreds of generations of foot traffic and the erosion of time itself. In places where the trail meets a sheer drop down a railing has been placed for the unwary traveler. About midway up a small pavillion has been carved out of the cliff-side providing the traveler a respite.
The trip does indeed only take a short time and the sun is just starting to go down as the two exit between two towering ridges into a leveled plateau. A field of flowers carpet the ground and in the distance on the other side, a waterfall turns into a stream running through the field and ending as it cascades down the mountain once more.
Marina steps into the field and with her trained gaze takes in the sight of the Reaches. Resting just by the stream is the remains to a picnic left haphazardly. She moves closer to investigate
Joran follows cautiously, reaching out to detect any nearby sentients...
With the tall grasses and stalks of flora, the crevacases in the surrounding cliff side, anyone could easily be hiding in wait, but as Joran takes a look around, he's unable to discern if such would be the case.
He does, however, sense an impending doom on this peaceful place.
"Careful Marina, I have a bad feeling about this place."
Marina has started to circle the picnic site.
Joran , trying to plan an appropriate action under the circumstances, instinctively turns his back to Marina so as to be on guard against any surprises.
"I know... this place has never felt like this. Jaya calls this place a Nexus, it must be reflecting what's happened." Marina continues moving carefully out and away from the site from where the children where. Finally she gives up. "I can't tell which one might be the children being taken away," she says in defeat.
"Don't think about the children as a whole then - just try and focus on your daughter, that may be a clearer path...?" Joran's tone is less commanding and more inquisitive. He's seen too many setups to help regarding this as anything but an ambush, but every effort must be made to retain a peaceful conclusion. His hand hovers near his saber hilt as he ponders options...
:The Force seems ambivalent to this matter, though you do get the feeling you are being watched by something.
Marina glances over at Joran and then closing her eyes obviously starts to concentrate. Her fingers go to caress the coral pearl on her bracelet. She stands like this for a long while.
Joran leaves his weapon be for the moment. Not wanting to interrupt Marina's concentration, he continues to focus on just being alert for any sign of change. They are almost certainly being watched - but that's not quite the same as an ambush,,, yet.
After a long few moments, Marina's eyes snap open and she moves toward the south side of the plateau. When she reaches the edge she peers down, a frown of concentration creasing her features. "She's this way somewhere."
Joran , glad he brought some rope, begins to uncoil it and look for a good anchor spot.
As Joran moves to anchor the rope, she stops him by grabbing his arm. "It looks like there's stairs hidden in the rock."
As she points them out Joran can start to faintly make them out too. The start several meters away and would only be visible to someone looking for them. The further they get the harder it is to see where they go. You have to be almost on top of it to see it.
"You first, or shall I?" Joran recoils the rope and fastens it back to the pack.
"I'll go fist," she says before taking to the first stair. One at a time she starts to head down the dliff face, the stairs taking them under the waterfall before curving back around on itself
Joran follows behind carefully, making sure a mis-step wouldn't cause them both to tumble...
Joran slips for a moment but is able to stabilize himself.
Marina looks behind her in concern. "Are you alright?"
"I think I would've preferred the rope..." replies Joran sheepishly. Considering the circumstances, both known and unknown, a fall could be disastrous. "At least this way anyone following us has an equal chance of taking a tumble, though how one would carry children down here is beyond guessing."
Marina shrugs lightly at the thought,her concentration going into finding the next stair and not following. About half way down the steep cliff face, Marina stops and begins to look around, cautious not to lean over to far. "There's no more stairs," she explains.
It's starting to grow dark on this side of the mountain as the sun meets the horizon. As the darkness looms on the two Jedi it becomes harder to miss the potent Force emanations from nearby.
Joran secures his handhold and searches for any sort of landing or opening, perhaps a hidden door even. In the growing darkness, however, it's difficult to see much of anything. "Can you see anything else? Hidden stairs usually lead somewhere - what about your daughter, is she nearby?"
Peering around both Marina and Joran nearly miss the outline of a door in the cliff face. The rock hewn door, a stone plug, marks the entrance into the mountain itself.
"She's nearby," she affirms. "We could probably move this together," she says, finding her own handholds to brace herself. Marina reaches out with the Force, manipulating the door to move.
Joran concentrates on the boulder, it's weightlessness in the Force, and, together with Marina, attempts to move it aside...
Together the pair of Jedi manage to shift the stone plug to the side. Almost hidden among the features of the stone wall, a dark opening beckons. Inside, the ground slopes sharply downward into blackness.
This close to the entrance, a sort of chill can be felt in the air, as though a cold breath were passing over the two Jedi's skin. It is definitely coming from the entrance, but further down the passage there's also a sense of strength, a power neither light nor dark, waiting patiently to return to active use.

### **Alicia** (2012-11-22 11:29:19)

Marina pulls out the glow-rod from her pack and she holds the light up into the darkness.
Joran retrieves a light of his own and drops lightly to the ground at the entrance to have a better look around. Joran peers into the darkness beyond...
Taking a look down the hallway Joran and Marina look up and the light from the glow rod casts just enough to reveal the half a dozen distinct square blocks of solid stones about 2 meters across, covering the length of the corridor and held up by stout chains.
If they were to fall they would block the passage
**Joran:** "Not sure I like the looks of those, though obviously someone must have put them there."
Marina nods in agreement. "Someone either wanted to keep someone out, or left the trap to keep them in." she says the last as an after thought.
**Marina:** ""Get ready to run," she says and readies herself for a burst of speed as she takes the first step into the corridor
**Joran:** ((There's one above my head?!))
Joran doesn't bother with a reply and simply follows Marina's lead. **Marina:** "Reaching the start of the blocks, she check behind her to make sure Joran is ready before putting on a burst of speed and runs underneath them.
**Joran:** ((Just let me know what you're looking for in terms of rolls, if any))
**Marina:** "As she steps under the first nothing happens, and neither do they fall when Joran gets under them either. In fact nothing happens and the young woman is stopped by another stone plug.
**Joran:** ((At least, for the first time in my Star Wars gaming history, I'm playing a character with a flashlight!! lol))
**Joran:** "We could probably manage to move this one like before... but where would we put it? There must be a switch or something..."
**Joran:** ((You can obviously cut out all this OOC when you move the game log, I hope, because I'm quite chatty this evening))
Marina and Joran take their time in attempting to find a switch in the wall; even going so far as to run their fingers over the stone for a hidden switch, but none can be found. Apparently, the architects intended for the plugs to be moved with sheer strength... or the use in the Force.,
It does look like though the plug can be slid into the wall.
**Joran:** "Hmm. We could try cutting through it, but that seems hasty... and without being certain what's behind it, we don't want to risk a cave-in or worse."
Joran spots the recess and motions to Marina:
**Joran:** "Maybe we can slide it this way?"
Marina nods and prepares herself to assist Joran in moving the heavy stone plug out of the way.
Once more, working in tandum the two Jedi manage to move the plug out of the way revealing the next room
Marina glances behing her and motions inside. With a mischevious grin she says, "After you."
Joran catches the sarcasm and remembers the precarious stairs only moments ago...
**Joran:** "Just keep an eye on those, k?" he says, pointing to the suspended stones.
This small, square chamber seems to be a crypt. A large sarcophagus, crudely carved with the image of an impressive humanoid figure, rests near the far wall, below a roughly-painted mural depicting the same figure pulling starships down from the sky. Scattered around the base of the sarcophagus are baskets of withered fruit, odd bits of metal fashioned into crude jewelry, and an old blaster pistol, its power pack long drained and dead. Most noticeable is the young man who lies very still on the earthen floor.
Marina follows cautiously behind keeping an eye not only on the blocks but the door they are walking through.
Marina upon seeing the young man, goes over to his side.
**Marina:** ""I think he's from the Tenson family. I remember seeing him when I visited the mines at Tenson's Reach."
Marina checks to see if he's alive.
**Joran:** "Any of this look familiar?" asks Joran, "Seems like maybe it has some sort of significance to the first landing..."
**Joran:** "Be careful - anyone who would go through the trouble to use two stone doors and a falling stone ceiling as backup probably has other ways to discourage curious adventurers. Any sense of where the children might be from here?"
Marina looks up from the dead Tenson. "No, most of the history from the first landing has been mostly lost. It got destroyed thousands of years ago from what I understand."
Marina takes a moment to concentrate and then points to the south. "That way further into the mountain. We're drawing closer. To Nadia at least. We can only hope the others are with her."
**Joran:** "Of course another interpretation might be that this gentlemen pulled starships from orbit for fun, which isn't a very comforting thought."
**Marina:** ""There weren't many Dark Force users who found their home here, and they weren't here for the original landing."
Joran circles the sarcophagus, giving it some distance, to better examine the wall behind it... Marina starts looking around touching the walls in places. Overall she's trying not to go near the motiff. "There has to be another door here somewhere."
**Joran:** "Wanna check that side? Could be another hidden door - I'm not crazy about opening that thing just yet..."
Marina finds the door on the east wall, the cracking paint managing to hide the edges of the stone door. Joran has no trouble seeing it once Marina has lit the wall from his side of the room.
**Joran:** "You seem to have found something..." says Joran, moving to Marina's side. "Your turn," he adds, smiling and motioning for her to enter first.
"We have to open it first."
**Marina:** ""We have to open it first."
As the door sets into the slot in the wall, there's a loud crashing sound of stone falling coming from the corridor they had vacated not too long ago.
The darkness grows thicker around the two Jedi, and a noise like cracking bones rises out of the open doorway. There is a brief sensation of someone staring at you intently.
The feeling of being scrutinized is particularly intense for Joran. There is a kind of pressure on his mind for a moment u2026 then an impression of dark satisfaction, as though someone horrible has been waiting here for him for a very long time.
Marina shivers beside him. The same impressions distracting her from the fact they are now trapped within the tomb.
Joran shakes his head to clear away the confusion...
**Joran:** "I think our peaceful negotiations are on hold for the moment..."
**Marina:** ""Let's find the children and get out of here... I don;t think anyone was ever meant to find this place."
Joran shines his light directly at the stranger, and draws his saber with his free hand. He stops just short of igniting the blade for the moment.
**Joran:** "Agreed."
Marina takes a cautious step into the next room; After all what else was there to do but to move forward.
Larger than the last room, this chamber is shrouded in darkness, as though it clings to every surface. Shapes of pillars can just be discerned running around the room. Filling the right hand wall is a large, shadowy bas-relief of a robed manu2014the same one on the sarcophagus outsideu2014wearing a foreboding masked helmet.
Joran would feel foolish under different circumstances. Instead, he stows his saber once more and follows Marina into the room beyond.
Marina inspects the end of the room before moving toward the bas-relief, looking at it from one end to another.
**Marina:** "The figure of the man takes up the majority of the center of the room.
**Joran:** "I don't like being trapped in general," mutters Joran, in a darker tone than he intended, "...but I don't like being trapped with company more. What do you suppose this is all about?" He makes a sweeping motion across the relief.
As if on cue, the helmeted figure suddenly movesu2014it is not a bas-relief at all, but some dark specter. u201cWelcome,u201d it rasps, in a gravelly voice. u201cWelcome to the home of Saalo Mornu2014the Dark Lord of the Sith. What offering have you brought me?u201d
Marina jumps back, startled.
Marina glances over at Joran. She's never had to deal with Sith before.
Joran considers his options in a fleeting instant, deciding on a conservative approach - they were, after all, trapped and with no clear direction of how to proceed.
**Marina:** ""Uh.." the young woman stumbles. "We.. didn't bring any offerings."
**Joran:** "Greetings, Lord Saalo. What would one such as you desire?" replies Joran, in his best negotiating voice.
Saalo obviously isn't hostile to you to begin with. He takes Marina's words with a shrug, but turns his attention to focus on Joran. "There is much I once desired, but now my existence has been to wander these halls."
**Joran:** "Ah, then allow me to begin by offering you some knowledge that may have not yet reached your ears -something to meditate upon in your time hereafter." Joran takes a bargaining pose, hoping Marina will play along passably - or at least not miss his cues - and folds his hands into his robes...
Marina follows Joran's lead and takes a further step back to allow the older Jedi to keep the specter's undivided attention while she keeps watch.
**Joran:** "The galaxy is in turmoil, my lord, and many evil deeds have been done. Surely you've sensed the grander events even here through the Force - those events haven't escaped the notice of very many - but even here, on Iruji itself, there is trouble enough."
Morn dismisses what Joran has to say, "What you speak of is a never ending cycle. I have existed for at least two, though I have lost count at that."
**Joran:** "Indeed you are right, my lord. Such is the way of things I suppose." At this Joran shrugs and nods, conceding the point. He begins to work his charm in earnest though, and hopes to do more than just chit-chat with ghosts."Yes, it's all too true. My companion and I, for instance, were in search of some missing children before you arrived and... Forgive me, I needn't bother about that now. You asked for an offering..."
Joran removes his pack, setting it down on the stone floor, and begins rummaging through it... Joran stops abruptly:
**Joran:** "M'Lord - do you have guests often? We noticed someone in the other room who seems to have taken up a more permanent residence..."
**Saalo Morn:** "Not often no. That particular young man wished to prove himself to me. Unfortunately, he didn't have what it took," this comes out with honest chagrin, as if he actually had hoped the man would have succeeded. "As for the children, I have actually welcomed several into my sanctuary."
Joran looks up, feigning a mixture of epiphany and disbelief...
**Joran:** "Ah! Well perhaps there -is- something we can do for you then m'lord, something far better than a useless trinket - surely we will succeed where he failed, and afterwards perhaps you could point us in the direction of the children!" Joran stands with palms upward and head cocked, waiting for Saalo's reply to the implied offer. His thoughts continue to race for a way to gain an upper hand though, should the need arise.
**Saalo Morn:** "Indeed, perhaps you can succeed, but sadly only one of you will do so." He glances behind Joran at Marina, until then ignored. The Specter considers her for a long moment. "No matter. The key to resetting the ancient trapsu2014and thus, reopening the way outu2014lies interred with my bones deep beneath here. But The dark side is strong thereu2014stronger than any of you. You would do far better to lie down here and die of starvation, than to face the horrors that await you below.u201d
Joran would know that the first Sarcophagus is likely just an effigy. Not really where Saalo has found his final rest.
The specter of Saalo Morn fades away, revealing a larger hall beyond him. From the darkness, skeletal figures rise up and surge forward, wielding old blaster pistols and primitive hand weapons.
Marina spotting the skeletons draws her lightsaber and charges forward. Finally able to do something she's good at!
Joran calls upon the Force and attempts to throw the second assailant to the ground...
Joran then, satisfied with the results, ignites his own lightsaber and prepares for further battle...
**Alicia G (GM):**The skeleton goes flying through the air at Joran's command and crashes into the other in a resounding mess of bones.
The remaining skeleton manages to extricate from the pile of bones of its partner. With its vibroblade in hand it retaliates against its closet target, Marina.
Marina manages to dodge to the side as she takes her own swing!
**Alicia G (GM):**As her lightsaber pierces the Skeletal figure they both vanish leaving no trace of their existance.
Marina hardly out of breath, the young woman is left stunned for a moment as she straightens from her finishing blow. "What the?"
Joran is relieved for the battle to be over, but is nowhere close to convinced this is what Saalo was talking about...
**Joran:**"Well that was fun..." he replies, giving Marina a sideways glance. Joran continues down the passage. "I suppose it's my turn this time."
Reaching a larger room, he pauses and waits for Marina to catch up.
**Alicia G (GM):**This great room has the aspect of an ancient throne room, complete with an elaborately worked golden chair on a dais near the right-hand wall. Arranged around the room are standing sarcophagi, bearing likenesses of Humans and a strange Humanoid Joran has never seen before. They all appear to be in tremendous agony. Behind the golden throne, a stone door is quickly gliding shut the sound of it can be heard from the entrance to the room, and Saalo Morn’s raspy voice whispers, “Hurry! This way …”
Joran surges forward, hoping Marina keeps pace...
**Alicia G (GM):**With a low, grinding noise, you hear as sarcophagi open painfully. From the darkness within there is a quick snap-hiss noise, and the unmistakable pale glow of a lightsaber illuminates the skeletal figures inside. They step toward you, and Saalo Morn’s voice cries: “Too late! Why didn’t you hurry when I told you to?”
**Joran:**"Not for lack of trying m'lord!" shouts Joran into the surrounding darkness, before rushing the nearest enemy...
**Alicia G (GM):**The skeleton takes the blow and while there's a glowing streak where Joran's lightsaber cauterized where hit it doesn't seem the least deterred in its goal.
Marina surges forward toward the northern adversary. Charging forward she takes a slash.at the lightsaber wielding skeleton as it emerges.
**Alicia G (GM):**THe skeletons converge on Marina, flanking her from the front and back before combining their attacks against the nimble young woman.
The remaining turns his attention toward Joran returning his blow.
Joran winces as the skeleton finds his mark, wondering what this has to do with any of the children...
Joran turns with the blow however, and attempts to return another of his own...
Joran and draws a deep breath to cope with the wound already received...
**Alicia G (GM):**THe skeleton continues to take the damage dealt by the Jedi's lightsaber unphased.
**Joran:**((2/3 Swift Actions to recover))
Marina tries to retreat from the position she's found herself in being flanked by the two skeletons. Her steps are blocked however and she continues to fight the best she can. Drawing on the Force she attempts the same stunt Joran pulled earlier making them collide with each other (and stepping out of the way in the process).
**Alicia G (GM):**The skeleton flies over Marina's head as she nimbly moves out its way colliding with the skeleton in a jarring of bones. The two fall into piles as Marina starts to back away from them.
The skeletons collect their respective parts and miraculously reconstitute into their original forms. They move forward following the Jedi that tossed them about.
The one facing Joran does attack, but its lightsaber subsequently turns off.
Frustration and anger surge through Joran and suddenly Joran fears as the skeleton's keep coming that Morn's claims the task is impossible comes to the surface. The raspy voice whispers in Joran's ear, “This could be over easily if you draw on the great Dark power of the Force. This creature will have to fall before you.” (spend a FP to add 2d6 to your next damage roll if you choose to draw on the Dark Side)
Joran is distracted, albeit momentarily, by Morn's words. Recovering quickly, he responds:
**Joran:**"True enough m'lord, but would that really be a suitable offering for one such as you? It is not -our- ease in this task that we seek but -your- approval in our success!"
((3/3 Swift Action to recover...))
**Alicia G (GM):**Distracted my Morn's words and the raging doubts Joran's swing goes wide, the skeleton able to dodge beneath the blade at the last minute.
Marina let's out a howl of frustration has the two skeletons continue to harass her. Bringing her lightsaber around on one she let's her anger get the better of her.
But as she goes to connect with the skeleton her full force placed into the attack she topples over right into her adversary.
The one attacking Joran manages to get its lightsaber active to attack him
**Alicia G (GM):**THe other take advantage of Marina's unbalanced state and combine their forces against her. (coordinate)
The blow hits her in the side and she lets out a gasp of pain as the wound is immediately cauterized. The blow continues to destabilize her
Saalo Morn continues to whisper. "What good would my approval be, if you and your companion are dead before you can receive it? Draw on the power and save yourself. Save her!"
**Joran:**"You underestimate my need for approval, m'lord..." Joran responds, picking up his opponent and attempting to hurl him at one of the others.
Joran then moves to Marina's side...
Marina spends what seems a long moment after she finds her balance to adjust the energy cell in her lightsaber to reignite it. After what seems like an eternity to the young woman, she manages to get it working again.
**Marina:**Not even the reassuring presence of her friend beside her though can keep the despairing thoughts being whispered to her away as she fights to finish it.
**Joran:**"Nevermind the fear Marina," he whispers, "That's not a path you want to tread..."
**Alicia G (GM):**The two remaining turn into dust with Marina's final act before disappearing completely into oblivion.
Marina looks over at Joran. "How can you remain so calm....?"
Marina is trembling from the mental and physical exertion.
Joran rests a gentle hand on Marina's shoulder:
**Joran:**"There is no emotion, only peace - even in dark caves with ghosts and skeletons. Maybe -especially- in dark caves with ghosts and skeletons." He helps her up and then speaks addresses the Sith Lord: "Anything else m'lord? We still have to find those children..."
Marina hangs her head for a long moment as she tries to find that center which had been drilled into her. Finally she looks up with a resolve.

### **BWS2K** (2012-11-23 20:45:05)

The brief reprieve from the attacks gives room for Joran's thoughts to settle. Marina is a lot tougher than she looks and he knows that, but they *were* in a pretty tight spot. Things had been fairly straightforward so far - cause for concern in and of itself, and Joran didn't want to count on the curiosity of a Sith Lord any longer than was necessary. He hoped there weren't any more surprises before they had a better idea of exactly where the children were.
*I'm glad Jaya kept Kit behind…*

### **Alicia** (2012-11-24 23:40:51)

**Alicia (GM):** Last Time:
**Alicia (GM):** Joran and Marina have encountered the entity of Saalo Morn which has admitted to have the children cloistered further into the crypt. Having overcome the skeletal wraiths with minimal wounds, they pair take in the Dark Hall and consider their next step. Saalo has gone quiet, his attempts for the Jedi to fall to the Dark Side thus far evaded.
**Alicia (GM):** While the ordeal has left Marina shaken, Joran's words have left her with a resolute calm. Now more than ever, she's determined to find her daughter, but not to lose herself to do so.
Marina starts to look around. After all they know there's a door, but there has to be some way to open it
**Joran:** "The lack of a prompt answer from Morn doesn't surprise Joran much - they had probably beat him at his own game. Finding a way to the children was no less important though...
**Joran:** "There's got to be a way further in..." he says to Marina, beginning to search the room.
Marina starts searching the wall around the door.
Joran This is the door that closed on us, and ghosts can't be the only ones to use it..."
Joran searches the wall as well for any trigger mechanisms or levers...
**Alicia (GM):** Joran realizes quickly that the catch for the door isn't on the wall, but manages to spot the release on the throne itself. Pressing it, the door opens revealing the landing and stairway beyond.
**Saalo Morn** "Congratulations. You have defeated my former student. You have only a little farther to go to retrieve the key which will set you free!"
Joran steps through the opening, following Marina into the area beyond...
**Joran:** "More stairs?"
Marina simply nods. "Nadia is still below us."
**Joran:** "You have a lovely home, m'lord Morn, but these visits do tend to involve an unexpected amount of exercise!"
Marina follows diligently behind.
**Alicia (GM):** The ghostly figure of Saalo Morn stands beside the large sarcophagus that bears his image; more finely wrought than the one in the entry chamber. "Here I lie waiting," says Saalo Morn, his voice filled with a kind of pride. "And also here lies the key to your freedom. Remove the lid, and take up my ancient helm. With it, you can unlock the barriers and be free at last." Joran bows low, and replies:
**Joran:** "We are honored for the privilege, m'lord, and we will be sure to retell this visit with great attention to detail."
Joran approaches the sarcophagus and retrieves the helm...
Saalo Morn moves to the side so that Joran doesn't pass through him or anything **Alicia (GM):** The lid gives way and reveals beneath the husk of what once was Saalo Morn, wearing a dusty helmet and gorget of dark metal. "There!" Saalo Morn says eagerly. "Take the helmet for your own, and it will amplify your powers enough so that moving the stone blocks in the entrance will be childu's play!"
Joran Joran ceremoniously uses the Force to remove the lid as gently and reverently as possible - still aware of great danger present if the Sith should go back on his word...
Joran pulls the helm to himself...
**Joran:** "Many thanks, m'lord - but several parents would be heartbroken if we left now. You'll remember I mentioned some children...?"
**Saalo Morn** "Indeed you did, however how do you intend on getting them out?"
Joran tucks the helm under his arm
**Joran:** "I see. I suppose even your generosity has its limits. Very well Lord Morn, we shall continue our search and then leave as you suggest."
Joran continues to look for hidden doors and passages within the chamber...
**Alicia (GM):** (nice.)
**Alicia (GM):** While you go about your search, Morn's ghostly entity disappears. But his presence can still be felt, more like an oppressive gaze now that you're deep within his domain.
**Saalo Morn** "During the search, as Marina joins you, she doubles over gasping for air. "See what your delay has caused. The air here has become too thin! You can only save her by donning the helmet and opening the way out!"
Joran rushes to Marina's side...
**Joran:** "Relax Marina, he's lying - I can breathe just fine and I'm not wearing his trinket. He must be doing this to you!" he says, hoping to encourage her and not resort to giving in to the Sith's demands.
Marina continues to gasp for air, and the supposed lack of it has cause her to fall to her knees.
**Alicia (GM):** Joran can definitely tell she's being influenced by the Force somehow. Whether through her air pipe being closed up or by illusion he can't tell by just looking at her.
Joran decides it's best to play Morn's game for the moment...
**Joran:** "You seem to have us at quite the disadvantage. Now if you'll be so kind...?" he replies, pulling on the helm and feeling more than trapped.
**Alicia (GM):** Putting on the helmet Joran can feel a surge of energy coming form it. Saalo wasn't wrong about how it would amplify the Force.
**Alicia (GM):** But the longer he wears the more prevalent he can feel Saalo. It's not long after putting it on that Joran can hear Saalo's voice whispering to him, louder than what it was back in the Dark Hall. Closer akin to a telepathic tough, but far more intimate.
**Alicia (GM):** The longer Joran keeps the helmet on the more Marina is able to start breathing again.
Marina leans against the wall, her eyes closed as she takes one deep breath after another.

---

### **Alicia** (2012-11-27 08:28:42)

Alicia G (GM):This whispering in Joran's mind starts to become louder, more prevalent than the rest of his own thoughts before after only a few short moments he's having a hard time unable deciphering his own from those of Saalo Morn.
Joran fights to maintain concentration, but Morn's voice is pressing against his Jedi defenses...
Alicia G (GM):The whispering continues unabated. Thoughts of how Marina comes from a line of betrayers - ask her about her father! - and how it won't be long till she finds no use for him any longer now that she's found her way safely back.
Joran begins to see Marina's motives in a warped way - perhaps she was just faking trouble breathing to shirk responsibilities in finding the children...
Alicia G (GM):And even if she's not, she's using Joran to find them in the first place. What's to stop her from discarding him once they're found. Already she's come very close to succumbing to her emotions. What's to stop her from falling into Saalo's to get what she wants?
Joran realizes women usually end up a liability in combat, their reactions far too emotional to make effective Jedi...
Alicia G (GM):She should be taken care of before she has the opportunity. Why set things up for her future indiscretion when it could all be taken care of so easily now? She's already weakened, it won't be much of a fight. Use your new found power and finish her off!
Joran:"You!" mutters Joran at Marina, "This is all your fault!" He extends a hand in her direction, drawing deep from the Dark Side of the Force to attack her before she can fully recover.
Marina is still crouched on the ground her breath nearly fully returned. Saalo's hold on her had all but vanished when Joran's possession had begun. She looks up at Joran with surprise and then a dawning suspicion as he converges on her, his hand rising to focus his power.
Marina feels her throat closing once more as Joran falls pray to Saalo Morn's wishes. "Joran?" she manages to sputter out, her body growing weaker with each passing moment of the onslaught.
A dark sense of gratification fills Joran as he sees his young companion becoming physically weaker. His internal voice urges him to continue.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-12-12 19:46:46)

"**Silence!**" shouts Joran, Marina's feeble cry for reason lost in futility against Saalo's grip on the former Jedi Knight. "**I *know* why you brought me here now, I finally understand *everything*! You would have taken the helm, taken my ship, my apprentice - you want it all for *yourself*!**"
Some part of Joran Nor knew these weren't his words, or at least not his true thoughts on the matter, but the Sith Lord's hold on his mind had muddled everything. After suppressing his passions for so long and hiding under a false identity, it felt indescribably fulfilling to give himself over to the power he was now wielding. In a way he was right - Marina *had* wanted his help to find the children and the two had formed a friendship not to be easily broken over the last several months. Still... Saalo Morn was no Jedi outlaw, and he had lived in the darkness longer than Joran could guess. The moment of lucidity vanishes as soon as it came, and Joran decides to test the depths of this new found power.
"**Pathetic girl! You know nothing of the Force, nothing of its true power! Even *without* the Order I was able to build myself an empire, but you wandered the galaxy like a lost pup!**" The words sound foreign to Joran, and he knows they aren't true - not exactly true anyway - but the temptation is too powerful for even his Jedi Knight defenses. His countenance darkens as he strengthens his grip on Marina...
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I'm assuming I can just maintain the Force Grip, so I'll roll the 6d6 damage (I think that's what it was?)
***18*** <- [4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4] 6d6
At this point I can go either way with Joran, I just wanted to make sure I didn't get too far ahead. At first I wanted to keep him around but it might be cool to have he and Marina fight, or she breaks free and convinces him to resist long enough to open the doors and she can escape with the children while he sacrifices himself to stay behind and destroy the tomb - which would be kind of cool since that's not the first time that's happened to someone she knows. Kit was more my focus in the next chapter anyway, and maybe this means cameos from a Force Spirit! All that to say - Joran is kinda disposable here. Sorry it took so long, things are still tricky. This evening's challenge was trying to remove a piece of gauze string that has managed to heal inside my daughter's wound. Sterile for the win!

Held up by the Force, the young Jedi’s eyes grow wide as the assault continues and the full depth of Joran’s sudden insanity becomes apparent. Having not fully recovered from Saalo Morn’s suffocating attempt, she succumbs more quickly to the lack of air. She tries to reach out to Joran’s own thoughts, but her attempts are waylaid by the more powerful presence of Saalo Morn.
A sense of hopelessness falls upon her and as her vision darkens she looks on her friend pleadingly. With the last breath she has remaining to her, she makes a final attempt to focus on Joran. “**Ppplease… he… Nad… Nadia…,**” she stops as the attempt becomes too much. As Joran maintains his grip her eyes quickly roll back as she begins to lose consciousness, her fight becoming a losing battle. Finding a sudden surge of strength she reaches out with her own ingrained ability in the Force, manipulating the helmet to fly free from where it sits on Joran’s head. The effort exhausts her and she succumbs completely, her body growing limp as it remains suspended by Joran’s will.

Joran's UtF
***31*** <- [11] 1d20 + 20
I redid your rolls for Force Grip since a new UTF roll is made for each round you maintain it, but since this round he did the 6d6 we'll stick with that! At this point I think he's taken a few Dark Side points ![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)
I think I've given you a couple outs, but go with what makes sense to you, even if that means you end up finishing Marina off. I rolled a 27 for the Move Object, but depending on how you want to handle it will determine whether the last ditch effort will succeed.
Have fun!

It takes a moment for Joran to come to his senses, during which Marina gently sinks to the ground as his power wanes.
"**Marina - no!**" he shouts, seeing instantly through Morn's lies. Of course *he* had made the decision to attack Marina - something that hurt more than he'd ever admit - but the Sith had certainly influenced him a great deal. Here below ground, so far from light, it seemed somehow the right thing to do. He rushes to her side and checks her vitals, ensuring that she'll be alright. He stabilizes her into a Force trance and drapes his robe over her unconscious form before turning back to address Saalo Morn.
"**Well, *Saalo Morn*, I trust you are satisfied,**" he says, purposely neglecting any use of proper title and walking over to retrieve the lost helm."**Now perhaps you and I can discuss the location of the children so we can be on our way?**"
Joran sets the helm deliberately in the Sith Lord's sarcophagus and awaits a response.

Taking 10 or 20 on the UtF check for putting Marina in a trance - it's only a DC15 anyway. Joran is *not* amused. ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

**Alicia G (GM):**As the helm is thrown clear, ending Morn's reign over Joran's thoughts, he releases a howl of frustrated rage. Checking over Marina, Joran finds that the young woman is near dead, her body holding on to a slim thread of life and worst yet she's not able to breath on her own. The trance will only delay the inevitable but will at least provide time which is very much of the essence.
Morn appears before Joran once more, fury radiating off of his ghostly visage.
**Saalo Morn:**"There will be no escape for you now," he says and then with a chilling laugh he disappears again.
**Joran Nor:**"Indeed," mutters Joran, "Not an entirely unexpected turn of events..."
Joran Nor looks about the empty chamber for any way to proceed from here, not anxious about the prospect over carrying Marina all the way back out and leaving the children behind...
**Alicia G (GM):**Off to the side you spot the hidden seams of the door, Made more noticeable perhaps by the fact that the dust has been disturbed in that vicinity.
With some effort Joran is able to move the door aside and beyond he can see more stairs leading down
Joran Nor picks up Marina gently and proceeds down the stairway cautiously...
**Alicia G (GM):**Well apparently he's not able to carry her more accurately
**Joran Nor:**(Well I suppose I'll UtF to have her follow along behind me then)
As you reach the bottom of the stairs, it's as if a heaviness is lifted from your chests. The Darkness that permeated the levels above is less acute here.
There is a little light in the room beyond given off by a glowing brazier. You can see the outline of a few crates and an old computer panel. Looking to the right you are surprised by another ghostly image. The pale blue form of a woman hovers on a small cushioned dias surrounded by the varying forms of children. The older children look toward the door in alarm and sudden fear, which diminishes only slightly when they get a good look at you.
Joran Nor sets Marina down by the doorway and approaches the children slowly...
**Alicia G (GM):**At last the woman glances up, there's a weariness on her face as if she's been fighting a long mental battle.
**Joran Nor:**"Greetings. I am Jedi Knight Joran Nor - I was sent by Jaya Cloudspinner."
**Jacelyn:**The figure nods in acceptance of his greeting. "I am Jacelyn. I am glad you have come." With a glance over at Marina she adds. "But i doubt it was just Jaya who has sent you."
Jacelyn shifts into a standing position, her feet not touching the ground as she moves toward Joran. The children around her move out of the way so that she moves unobstructed.
Jacelyn examines Marina's unconscious form. "I was a healer once, but I'm afraid there's little I can do. It's taking all my effort to keep Saalo from this place."
**Joran Nor:**Joran gives a low bow to Jacelyn. "True, there were others. Many feared for the children and we arrived in time to be of service."
"Yes, he's quite powerful. How did you come to be here then?"
**Jacelyn:**"This is my penance.. to watch and prevent Saalo from ever leaving this place. Unfortunately when the young man woke him from his young slumber, I was too slow to act to prevent the capture of these children," she looks behind her, an expression shared by any concerned mother. "I think he meant to torment me and gain his vengeance this way."
Joran Nor ponders her words carefully, then asks a necessary question:
**Joran Nor:**"I don't suppose there's any other way out of here...?"
Jacelyn shakes her head. "Only the one way, but Saalo's will is what is holding the blocks in place."
**Joran Nor:**"I know a way to move them, but I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to help guide the children out - are you bound to this chamber only, or can you see them safely outside?"
Jacelyn considers it a moment. "I should be able to protect them from Saalo's influence long enough to get the children out. But her.. I have no way to bear her." she indicates Marina's unconscious form. "May I suggest another way?" she asks rhetorically before continuing.
**Joran Nor:**"Your advice is most appreciated."
**Jacelyn:**"If you could somehow destroy the helm it's quite possible Saalo will lose his link."
"Even before he came into the possession of it it was already a very powerful artifact. When Saalo died he might have attached his spirit to it."
**Joran Nor:**"I see," replies Joran, turning to look back at the stairs. "Then I'll be right back, Jacelyn."
Joran Nor sets off for the burial chamber with a look of determination...
Jacelyn nods and heads back to the platform
"Morn!" shouts Joran, his lightsaber flickering to life, "This ends now!"
**Alicia G (GM):**When you come back to the sarcophagus you see that it's been emptied.
You sense that there's something off about what you're seeing.. or lack of what you're seeing inside it
**Joran Nor:**"Nothing to say, m'lord?" Joran asks sarcastically, "Then I'll just have to figure things out on my own..."
Joran Nor begins slicing through the sarcophagus in small increments from top to bottom, working his way along the side...
**Joran Nor:**"Where could you be..."
**Alicia G (GM):**He appears not far away, looking more enraged as you desecrate his resting place. "You doom yourself, and that betrayer's spawn," he spits out. "You think you can leave here without me?"
**Joran Nor:**Still continuing to cut the sarcophagus into neat pieces, Joran responds: "Well we don't seem to be able to leave -with- you, and this certainly does feel better. Now normally a Jedi wouldn't overreact this way, but recent experiences have left me... emotional."
**Alicia G (GM):**As you cut away, the illusion hiding the content falters and the mummified remains appear as well as the helmet where Joran had left it. In a final effort to thwart Joran's intentions he is suddenly overcome by overwhelming pain in his head and finds himself blind.
This causes Joran to stumble backwards and lose his close proximity to his final goal.
Joran Nor tries to resist the attack, remembering Marina and the children...
**Alicia G (GM):**Joran manages to break through the pain of the onslaught and while his vision is cloudy he can make out the outline of the sarcophagus not far from him.
**Joran Nor:**Joran reaches out with the Force, pulling the helm to his free hand and hovering his blade just inches from its center. "It's over, Sith."
Joran Nor cuts the helm in two, letting it fall to the floor at his feet.
**Alicia G (GM):**Joran can feel the release of stored Force power as the helm is broken. There isn't another word from Saalo, but from the lightening of the Dark energy previous present Joran gets the sense that the Dark Spirit is gone. However, whatever Morn's final vidictive act was on Joran's vision persists..
Joran Nor stows his weapon and feels his way along the wall and down the stairs once more to Jacelyn.
**Joran Nor:**"Morn is gone, the way should be safe now but I can't see anything just yet."
**Alicia G (GM):**There's a small child, a toddler really, who is resting her head on Marina's chest. She looks up at Joran with the same eyes as the wounded woman's.
**Jacelyn Cloudspinner:**"It is done then," she says with hint of sadness,
**Joran Nor:**"Are you able to lead the way? These children don't know me, and they've been through enough already..."
Jacelyn Cloudspinner nods, and motions for the oldest to come to her and she whispers something to him. With a hesitant nod he approaches Marina, taking her glowrod and then picking up the toddler. Gathering the children around her, she has the oldest lead the way with Marina's glowrod and the others follow demurely around Jacelyn.
**Jacelyn Cloudspinner:**Upon reaching the blocked entranceway, Jacelyn moves ahead. "This is where we say farewell."

Joran emerges last from the tomb complex and bows to Jacelyn a final time. "**Thank you for your help, and your sacrifice, Jacelyn Cloudspinner. May the Force be with you.**"
The Jedi Knight reaches for his comlink and calls for a pickup from the Rangers, grateful to get back to Kit and his ship.

### **Alicia** (2012-12-16 11:52:52)

Jacelyn smiles at Joran, "May the Force be with you, Joran Nor. And thank you." Turning to the still lowered blocks she holds her arms out in front of her and as she starts to pass though them they rise and she starts to fade until finally when she reaches the final block disappears completely. THe door Joran finds has been closed, but with only a little effort he's able to use the Force to open it. Sunlight is beginning to peak behind the surrounding mountains and brighten the dreary cliff side. the light has the added benefit of revealing the stairway heading upward toward the valley of the Reaches.
It's there that the Rangers meet Joran and the rescued children. Having brought a transport carefully into the valley, the men and women consisting of the local peacekeepers load everyone inside. A medic affer looking over the children for hurts, takes Marina from Joran and loads her onto a stretcher.
The children area soon strapped in and it's from their chatter Joran learns such trips are very rare; their transports used only when the need is dire. The Ranger Joran quickly realizes is their leader makes his way over as the transport begins to lift off. "Elder Cloudspinner is eagerly waiting at the estate to hear what transpired."
