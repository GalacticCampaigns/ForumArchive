# Burst Transfer [SW: ROTE]

"**I have saved you from your fate for one reason only,**" he started in his contralto voice, "**You are to serve the Empire. I know nothing of your current training but am interested to see what one of your caliber will do in gratitude for he whom has saved his life…**"
The moments dragged on while the Umbaran inquisitor watched Grimm quietly, waiting to see what sort of response his Zabrak captive would give. The shackles on his hands made movement almost impossible but sitting cross-legged on the deck wasn't the most uncomfortable he'd ever been. The inquisitor stood calmly just outside the perimeter of Grimm's reach, observing... and watching.

Pretty short but I didn't want to get too bogged down at one time. This is an opportunity for you Grimm to speak or have an inner monologue or just have a staring contest - whatever you like. The shackles are on his hands and bolted to the floor, btw. Don't feel rushed, I'll be focusing on Alicia's post next which might take a little bit of writing. I figure you're still in the shuttle, headed to a ship that *isn't* the *Vendetta* right now, literally picking up right where you left off with your background. Do me a favor and put your character sheet in your signature block? Cheers!

To look at, the Umbaran seemed quite pitifull to Grimm, he had grown in an environment that bread conflict, but the air around the skinny alien seemed to radiate an oily malevolence. It seemed with Garms death he had opened Grimms senses to a deeper understanding.
He could not help but think that this new understanding of existence was what his Grandmaster had tried to beat into him and his brothers, but altogether different. To Grimm it was like seeing the other side of a moon he had been looking at his whole life, still so far out of reach however. Realising the strange Umbaran was still leering and unable to ascertain a way to fight his way out of this situation, Grimm lowered his eyes, hopefully it would be taken as submissive.

"**Hmmm… nothing to say, eh? Very well.**"
The Umbaran circles Grimm slowly, hands folded behind his back, crimson robes dragging across the deck in his wake.
"**Before we begin, I should inform you that there is no escape.**" The voice was coming from behind Grimm now, confident and calm, "**You are neither the first nor the last to be in those shackles. Some have accepted freedom in his majesty service, the others perished slowly and painfully. Very painfully.**"
Having come back around to where he began, the inquisitor now reached for a panel on the wall of the cell that lifted and revealed an array of tools of his trade. He paused in dissatisfaction.
"**These are for… lesser men. For you, I think, we shall skip ahead a few sessions. You may want to take a deep breath now…**"
The inquisitor raised a single hand towards Grimm and suddenly seemed less vulnerable than he had a few moments ago...

**Force Grip**
***21*** <- [8] 1d20 + 13
That beats the DC20 for 4d6 damage...
***13*** <- [2, 2, 3, 6] 4d6
So that's the damage to Grimm (-13 hp) but it doesn't break his Fortitude Defense so despite the loss of hp, he's no worse for the wear. You're welcome to mutter a few things if you like. ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

Although physical pain was something Grimm had grown accustomed to, was something he had learned from, had dwelled on from time to time, had used as fuel for survival, and had ultimately made his ally, the ability to inflict said pain with a mere gesture was well beyond him. He believed that this was the power his Grand Master had promised, the power he had craved for the first decade and a half of his life. He also had believed he had found something else to live for, however, he desperately wanted to cling to the idea that he could live for something larger, something that was in itself a reward. But considering his position, and his options, he believed he had little choice.
**"Incredible,"**he grated through clenched teeth, **"This power, this is what was promised me…"** He was not sure if the Umbaran would take him earnestly, he was not even sure if he wasn't. But he had fought for so long, had fought almost everyone and everything, the only one that had ever helped him had just died a slave. No matter what the one known as Garn had once been, he would be forgotten among the filth and refuse of a spice mining colony. And Grimm was now shackled to the floor of a ship being transported to the force knew where and being strangled by dark magic. **"Teach me…"**

The inquisitor's eyes narrow at Grimm's words and the pain stops as suddenly as it began.
"**…you are weak, but you may learn… in time.**"
The hatch behind him opened and a pair of stormtroopers entered the room, flanking another prisoner.
"**This man was taken from the mines as you were. One meal will be delivered to this cell every twenty-four hours. I will return in a week to begin your training.**" With those curt instructions, the inquisitor leaves the room. The soldiers toss the prisoner - a Rodian in dirty tattered clothes - on the floor in front of Grimm and leave the room. As the hatch closes, the shackles on Grimm's hands are opened and fall harmlessly to the deck.
The Rodian scrambles back on his hands and knees, putting as much distance as possible - which isn't a lot - between the physically superior Zabrak and himself. He watches Grimm nervously.

Make sure to adjust your hp on your character sheet to reflect the damage from the last post. My post about "*tools of his trade*" was to imply torture tools of various sorts like little blades and other pointy painful things, FYI. Any other questions, let me know. Cheers!

*Weak…?* Grimm shook his head slowly as he massaged his wrists, *So strength is torturing a man who cannot fight back?* Still, obeying the Umbaran had stopped the pain, if that all there was to serving the empire perhaps he should consider it more carefully. He eyed the Rodian dangerously, one meal a day? He could kill the pitiful cringing being in seconds, as he believed he was supposed to. Perhaps this would please the Umbaran, then just do as you're told and serve the Empire and live well? Along side those who had enslaved his friends and slaughtered his people?
A whimpering shudder from his cell mate snapped Grimm back to present, his horns, facial tattoes and intense green eyes were usually enough to make people leave him alone. Coupled with the snarl he wore, it was probably unsettliing to be in such a close and enclosed proximity. His own visage had a modicome of malevolency normally, but when violence was on his mind...
**"You know he expects me to kill you,"** he affirmed the creature **"any reason why I shouldn't?"** he rose to his feet, if the Rodian turned out to be useless he would try to make it quick, he could see no other way.

The words clearly rattle the already frightened Rodian.
"**Helping you, please…! No hurting us…!** he replies in broken Basic. He points to the bruises on Koda's wrists from the shackles and then to his own, unbruised wrists. "**We're…**", he pauses here, searching for the right words, "**Jedi doctor…!**"
A Force-sensitive Rodian healer makes about as much sense as anything else that's happened to Grimm recently, though it could easily be some sort of trap - he's probably hungry too. His physique and torn clothing would seem to indicate that he is indeed from Kessel, or at least spent some time there, but - true to his word - there don't appear to be any wounds on him to match the small spots of blood on his clothing.

Sorry it took such a long time to post. It's freeform, so if you choose to attack this guy you can describe in detail (or not) how it goes down. He hasn't been named yet, and so falls under my "*if you don't have a name you are at risk of being ruthlessly slaughtered by my players*" rule.

*Jedi…* the word echoed in Grimms head, guardians of peace, upholders of the law, symbols of good and ritiousness, stories of the famed Jedi were popular among slaves in the mines. Especially around Garn, he had spoken of them often, sometimes fondly, sometimes with deep regret. Maybe he had deeper connections than he had let on.
In years past Grimm would have torn the Rodian apart with his bare hands at the claim, but would he have attacked his only friend, the resentful old preacher who'd taught Grimm to behave above his base bestial urges? Probably not, and this pitiful being could not possibly be one. It could barely speak basic, it quaked at the mere sight of Grimm. And they had all been eradicated anyway, had been bested by the Empire. Work for the Empire? For those that had enslaved his friends and slaughtered his people? Grimm would rather see it dissolved, enflamed, utterly destroyed and the force would be the key. That which the knowledge of he had next to nothing, just that it was there. In fact the only thing he really knew about the force was that he was almost completely ignorant. Maybe the Rodian had the link Grimm needed to understand, to embrace and use the Force. If it could truly heal its own wounds that would be an enourmous advantage in the battles to come. And maybe he was just stalling for time.
Grimm suddenly exploded into motion, then stopped, his tattoed face mere inches from the Rodians quivering snout as it tried to crawl back into the wall. **"If you're lying to me,"** Grimms voice was quiet, dispassionate and threatening **"I will take it personally, and your death will be much slower. So you'd best start being helpful, Jedi."**

The Rodian gets the message, and immediately points to Koda's wrists. He places his hands on them gently and closes his eyes, concentrating - a difficult task, given the circumstances. Nevertheless, Koda can feel a power course through his body that seemed somehow familiar and foreign at the same time. The sensation lasted for only a few moments but he had the distinct feeling that if it had lasted any longer... something. The thought was gone - as was the pain from the Umbaran and the shackles. His wrists showed no signs of injury at all.
"**…We being friends now, yes?**"

You're back at full hp now, for whatever it means in free-form... lol! Your move! As an aside, if you haven't picked it up yet, you pretty much determine what happens in a sandbox style. I have a loose idea of a goal and you'll get there no matter what, just have fun. Cheers!

For long moments Grim sat staring, first at his wrists then the Rodian then back breathless and overwhelmed. **"Friends?"** he asked weakly. This creature whom he had threatened with pain and death had shown him a compassion he had only seen a few times in his life, and a power he had not thought possible. And he had come from the mines? Were there others? He remembered dimly his whispered promise to Garn *'I can only try…'* He had to try, he had to try to right the wrongs that had been committed against himsellf and so many others. But he was only one man against how many? What could possibly be accomplished from attacking them besides his own demise? He needed power, he needed the power to destroy his enemies, and perhaps the Umbarans power was the key to this. After all the overseer of that sector had been afraid, afraid of the Empire. No, he had been afraid of cosequences.
A vision of Garn flashed through his head again, ***"Beware the methods you use do not turn you into what you are fighting."*** Those that the overseer feared were exactly those Grim wanted to destroy, because of the atrocities they were committing to others like himself and the Rodian.
Something occured to Grim at that moment, it was a far shot and he'd be walking a razors edge but he could not become what he fought, perhaps with the Rodians teachings he might keep his own mind. **"Friend?"** he repeated **"I am honoured. My name is Koda Grim,"** he helped the Rodian to his feet and offered his hand, **"Could you teach me how you do that?"** He would take his vengeance; on the slavers who had taken him and so many others from their homes, on the Overseer of the mines and those like him, on the whole *Kriffing* Empire with teachings from their own agents. But he had to keep his mind. A razors edge.

His cellmate looks puzzled at first, then responds with a shrug: "**Maybe…**" He doesn't give the impression of someone who knows what he's doing - perhaps just another gifted Force-user without any formal training. The term "Jedi" means many things to many people these days.
The days pass slowly but after the week of meals is soon up and both the Rodian and Koda are still quite healthy. Sharing the meals wasn't as bad as it was intended to be when there's no real physical labor during the day. While it becomes clear that the Rodian, whose name is Heelo, isn't a fully-trained Jedi he does manage to help Koda understand some very basic tenets of using the Force. Compared to the time in the mines, it was actually fairly relaxing - all things considered. Soon, though, the Umbaran returns:
"**Hmm,**" he mutters, looking down at Heelo. "**…disappointing.**" He ignites a lightsaber and, in a rapid flash of red light, decapitates him. Stowing the weapon on his belt, he turns calmly to Koda.
"**Peace is a lie, there is only passion. Meditate on this.**"
He turns to leave once more, stepping around the Rodian's crumpled body.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

He hasn't left yet, so if you want to talk to him you can. Like the name Heelo? Because he heals? That's trademark BW right there. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)
Also, I'm going to give you a +2 modifier to UtF checks for a while to represent what transpired between you and Heelo. *Use the Force* is actually a class skill for anyone with Force Sensitivity, like Koda, but you're not trained in it and I want to do some sort of bonus... so that's what you get. Lemme know if you have questions.

Really love the name, it even sounds Rodian

Grim looks down at his fallen companion *Arazors edge,* he concedes. His plans shattered, he reverts to the only thing that will let him survive: compliance.
Concentration was one thing that Grim excelled at within his training, his intuitiveness his dedication all were part of his ability to apply himself whole-heartedly to a current situation, and apply himself he does now.
Reaching out his hand like the claw of an eagle Grim grips the Rodians head through the force in an attempt to carry it to himself, then looking at the severed head he sighs, **"Well, at least he got me started…"**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

UTF check here but I still don't quite understand how to roll. Just assume if he rolls well, he picks up the head and telekinetically floats it toward him intill he can catch it, otherwise he looks dishevelled concentrating so hard and nothing coming of it.
