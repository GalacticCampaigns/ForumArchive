<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Zeitgeist of Rebellion [Star Wars – Rebellion Era]</span>
Over half a year has passed since the Battle of Hoth. The Rebel Alliance continue to plague the Empire with their daring ploys, albeit at great cost in resources and lives. Many heroes are doing their part to topple the corrupt regime. The actions of some of these heroes are already documented. Others are not yet the subject of such focus. But soon, they will be.
The story opens on the terrestrial planet Faa, in the Kamino system, where the Imperial forces aboard the Star Destroyer *Unswerving* have discovered the existence of a small Rebel base. In the midst of a pitched battle on the ground and amidst the stars, all manner of Rebel operatives have their lots thrown together in the mad dash to reach a transport and escape.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">The Role of the Guide</span>
A Guide is someone who currently has narrative control over the story. Other players still have power to affect outcomes, particularly when it comes to dictating events involving their own character, but it is the Guide who decides the overall plot direction for the chapter and ensures the players are working together to further the story, not against each other. To aid story cohesion and in case of rules disputes, I will always act as a Guide, and for the first chapter I will be the only Guide. At each break in the narrative other players will get a chance to become a partner Guide and help steer the story for the next chapter.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Treatment of Other Characters</span>
Not only can you not auto-kill another player's character without permission, you also cannot simply assume you beat them. If a player does not agree that your success should be automatic in any competition, dice will be rolled to determine the victor.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Special Rules for Non-PCs</span>

* All NPCs have either Major, Minor, or Minion status. Typically, if an NPC is named they are assumed to have Major or Minor status, while a member of the faceless masses is precisely what they appear to be: an extra, or in other words a Minion. Note that an NPC’s status is not an indication of how often they are involved in the game but rather their significance to it – a Major NPC may only be met as part of one adventure, while a particularly lucky (or just forgotten) Minion could associate with the group for the entire campaign (and possibly be promoted to a new status as a consequence!).
* A Major NPC is treated like a PC in many respects. They cannot be used or killed without permission.
* A Minor NPC has some protection from the whims of the players. They cannot be used without permission, but they can be killed. However, attacking a Minor NPC is not guaranteed and the player cannot simply say the attack succeeds as with a Minion. Dice are rolled.
* A Minion is there simply for set-dressing, and can be controlled by any player. In combat situations they might be killed in droves simply to add to the coolness of a scene.
* New Minor and Minion NPCs can be added by any player if the sense of the scene allows it, though it is courteous to check with other players to make sure they’re okay with the scene being extended. Before adding a new Major NPC, check with the current Guides.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Conflict Resolution</span>
In any contest between PCs and NPCs where a victor cannot simply be decided, or when a single character attempts something that the rest of the group agree is improbable, a method is required to resolve the issue. For this game, we will make use of the lovely new dice-rolling code.
If a character is considered to have Average ability at whatever they are attempting, they would roll d6. The result is compared to that of the opponent or an agreed upon target number.
If on a character's sheet their ability is marked as being greater or lesser than Average, the adjective used to describe their skill is compared to the most equivalent adjective on the following list to determine what they roll. If an ability is not on a character's sheet, the player must get agreement from the group that it is a suitable addition to their sheet. The Guide has final say on how good the character is with their new skill, and decides after factoring in the opinions of the group.

<span style="font-size: 1.10em;">Ability Levels</span>* **Terrible** ability: roll a d3 and deduct 2.
* **Very Poor** ability: roll a d4 and deduct 2.
* **Poor** ability: roll a d4 and deduct 1.
* **Below Average** ability: roll a d6 and deduct 1.
* **Average** ability: roll a d6.
* **Above Average** ability: roll a d6 and add 1.
* **Good** ability: roll a d8 and add 1.
* **Very Good** ability: roll a d8 and add 2.
* **Exceptional** ability: roll a d10 and add 2.
* **Extraordinary** ability: roll a d10 and add 3.

Captain Gelbin Krosse of the *Imperial-class* Star Destroyer *Unswerving* watched from the bridge as his close range fighters engaged the Rebel scum above Faa. Against the backdrop of the terrestrial planet and the surrounding stars, he observed a ballet-like quality to the spiralling of the fighter squadrons, and was almost hypnotised by the sudden appreciation of beauty found even in this pitched battle. The romantic thought was short-lived, brought to a cruel end by the destruction before his eyes of nearly an entire wing of TIE-fighters at the hands of those blasted X-wings. Superior craft in all ways other than speed and numerical superiority he had to admit (though only to himself), the fighters fielded by the Rebels these days were becoming more and more troublesome. In darker moments he had thought that they may well be the key—*dread the thought!*—to a Rebel victory.
But not today. The power aboard his vessel could crush anything the Rebels on Faa were fielding many times over.
‘Captain, the ground troops have breached the Rebel base!’
Krosse smiled. It was almost over.
‘Relay this order: No survivors.’

With explosions rocking the tunnels, Eric Nahl did the very best he could to keep his balance as he fought against both tremors and the flow of fleeing base operatives. He would leave on one of the last transports, but first he had to ensure the folks he had grown to know on Faa had a fighting chance to make it off-planet alive.
The flow of organic traffic cleared as the dark-skinned young Jedi-to-be turned a corner that would lead him toward one of the base entrances. There were doors all along the passage, some open and others closed. He wasn’t sure, but he thought they were quarters. And wasn’t one of the rooms at the far end a secondary operations room? Before he could check any of the chambers, a group of white-clad stormtroopers rounded the far corner, their armour stark against the dark grey stone of the tunnel walls.
Apparently instantaneously Eric’s green lightsaber was in hand, thrumming and flashing, and two of the stormtroopers were cut down by their own deflected blaster bolts.
