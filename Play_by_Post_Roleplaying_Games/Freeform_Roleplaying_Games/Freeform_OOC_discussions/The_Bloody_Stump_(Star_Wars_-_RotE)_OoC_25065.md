<strong>Owner and Patron</strong>

**Galak Creosote:** The gruff and tough owner of Corellia's most prominent den of thieves. Don't let his mouth and "shoot first" methods fool you, Galak may come off harsh, but he means well and typically keeps the best of intentions. Honestly, he's quite nice, once you get to know him...
Really.<div style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Employees</strong>
Just Galak runs things at the moment, but helping hands are always welcome. There are no official position titles as of yet, but if you&#39;re interested in working here be sure you can meet the requirements, fill out the application below and PM it to me.

**Job Requirements**
</div>

-Be literate.
-Present yourself to the thread or log in at least once a week, or prove otherwise that you're an active member of the site. After two weeks if you're a no-show the position will be opened for someone else. (This can be amended if for emergencies or hiatus)
-Be able to perform the job you've applied for easily and well. Prerequisites are good but not required.
-Do not harass the guests; take all issues to the owner - working for me will not give you any rule-making abilities unless I state otherwise.
-Uphold the cantina reputation.
-Be prepared to promote the business elsewhere, when appropriate. (This is optional, but it is worth a bonus.)

I want to take this next post to explain the "BSS" I have posted in the main IC thread's title. In order to establish a working circuit of threads once whatever plot picks up in our beloved Stump, the BSS mark will signify a handful of constants. Standing for "Bloody Stump Standard" any thread marked with this tag follows a specific outline and sticks to a certain collection of setting rules to prove that it is connected within a continuity.
Any and all BSS threads exist in the Old Republic somewhere in the timeline around 800 BBY.
I assure you more restrictions and setting laws will follow, give us time to build a story.
