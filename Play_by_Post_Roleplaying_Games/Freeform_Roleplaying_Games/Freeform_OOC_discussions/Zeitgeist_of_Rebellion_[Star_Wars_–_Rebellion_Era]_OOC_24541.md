<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">The Role of the Guide</span>
A Guide is someone who currently has narrative control over the story. Other players still have power to affect outcomes, particularly when it comes to dictating events involving their own character, but it is the Guide who decides the overall plot direction for the chapter and ensures the players are working together to further the story, not against each other. To aid story cohesion and in case of rules disputes, I will always act as a Guide, and for the first chapter I will be the only Guide. At each break in the narrative other players will get a chance to become a partner Guide and help steer the story for the next chapter.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Treatment of Other Characters</span>
Not only can you not auto-kill another player's character without permission, you also cannot simply assume you beat them. If a player does not agree that your success should be automatic in any competition, dice will be rolled to determine the victor.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Special Rules for Non-PCs</span>

* All NPCs have either Major, Minor, or Minion status. Typically, if an NPC is named they are assumed to have Major or Minor status, while a member of the faceless masses is precisely what they appear to be: an extra, or in other words a Minion. Note that an NPC’s status is not an indication of how often they are involved in the game but rather their significance to it – a Major NPC may only be met as part of one adventure, while a particularly lucky (or just forgotten) Minion could associate with the group for the entire campaign (and possibly be promoted to a new status as a consequence!).
* A Major NPC is treated like a PC in many respects. They cannot be used or killed without permission.
* A Minor NPC has some protection from the whims of the players. They cannot be used without permission, but they can be killed. However, attacking a Minor NPC is not guaranteed and the player cannot simply say the attack succeeds as with a Minion. Dice are rolled.
* A Minion is there simply for set-dressing, and can be controlled by any player. In combat situations they might be killed in droves simply to add to the coolness of a scene.
* New Minor and Minion NPCs can be added by any player if the sense of the scene allows it, though it is courteous to check with other players to make sure they’re okay with the scene being extended. Before adding a new Major NPC, check with the current Guides.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Conflict Resolution</span>
In any contest between PCs and NPCs where a victor cannot simply be decided, or when a single character attempts something that the rest of the group agree is improbable, a method is required to resolve the issue. For this game, we will make use of the lovely new dice-rolling code.
If a character is considered to have Average ability at whatever they are attempting, they would roll d6. The result is compared to that of the opponent or an agreed upon target number.
If on a character's sheet their ability is marked as being greater or lesser than Average, the adjective used to describe their skill is compared to the most equivalent adjective on the following list to determine what they roll. If an ability is not on a character's sheet, the player must get agreement from the group that it is a suitable addition to their sheet. The Guide has final say on how good the character is with their new skill, and decides after factoring in the opinions of the group.

<span style="font-size: 1.10em;">Ability Levels</span>* **Terrible** ability: roll a d3 and deduct 2.
* **Very Poor** ability: roll a d4 and deduct 2.
* **Poor** ability: roll a d4 and deduct 1.
* **Below Average** ability: roll a d6 and deduct 1.
* **Average** ability: roll a d6.
* **Above Average** ability: roll a d6 and add 1.
* **Good** ability: roll a d8 and add 1.
* **Very Good** ability: roll a d8 and add 2.
* **Exceptional** ability: roll a d10 and add 2.
* **Extraordinary** ability: roll a d10 and add 3.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Eric Nahl</span>
**Species:** human.
**Homeworld:** born aboard a space transport.
**Age:** eighteen.
**Gender:** male.
**Appearance:**
**Personality:**
**Notable Abilities:** moderate Force control; skilful lightsaber duellist; talented pilot; adequate mechanic; good shot; terrible cook
**Flaws:** too honourable for own good; puts others before self; has only imperfect control over his emotions.
**Weapons:** green lightsaber, left to him by his mother; heavy blaster pistol.
**Significant Equipment:** none of note.
**Bio:** Eric is the only child of Quixis Kolle and Andren Nahl. Quixis was a Jedi, while Andren is a trader. Quixis survived the Jedi purge due to her discovery of a primitive race of Force-sensitives on the planet Solsis VII. She spent many years studying the Hobben's traditions and teaching them of the Jedi way. She thought they could be a great asset to the Jedi Order if converted, particularly during such volatile times as the Clone Wars. She abandoned the attempt only when the Hobben tired of her attempts to convert them and demanded she leave their world. It was on her return to Coruscant that Quixis intercepted Obi-Wan Kenobi's signal, and was able to successfully evade capture.
Quixis eventually fell in with the trade Andren Nahl, finding a lifestyle of constant movement helpful in staying under the radar. The two married, and Eric was conceived and born in 15 BBY. Tragically, Quixis died in childbirth.
Consequently, Eric was raised solely by his father, and was groomed for the trader's lifestyle. Only when his latent Force powers began to manifest did Andren decide to tell his son of his mother's legacy, and bequeath to him two important items. Firstly, Quixis' lightsaber. Secondly, the diaries she had begun during her time in exile, in which she recorded everything she could of Jedi lore and training methods to help her unborn son.
With his new power, and the realisation of new responsibilities, Eric decided to throw in his lot with the Rebellion. Andren decided to follow his son. The two of them began to pick up and deliver valuable cargoes for the Rebellion, while all the while Eric slowly developed the skills of a Jedi.
While briefly station on Hoth, Eric met Luke Skywalker and another potential Jedi, a Zabrak named Reba. The three shared some knowledge. Though Skywalker had other responsibilities, Eric and Reba decided to follow up a lead from Quixis' diaries, and travelled to Solsis VII to learn Force techniques from the Hobben's Ali'la Shamans. They trained there for several months, but were captured during a raid on their hosts by a rival tribe. When they were finally rescued just after the Battle of Hoth, both were too weak to even stand.
While the two were recuperating Reba fell victim to assassination at the hands of a Seyugi Dervish, and for his safety Eric was immediately moved to a small, secret Rebel base on Faa.
