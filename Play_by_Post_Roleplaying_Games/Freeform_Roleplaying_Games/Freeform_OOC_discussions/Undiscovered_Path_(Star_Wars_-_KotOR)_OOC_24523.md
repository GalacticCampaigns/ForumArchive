The Mandalorian Wars are over leaving the Republic in apparent ruins. With their greatest champion, Revan, gone with his apprentice and their followers the Jedi are left to bolster the Republic. A year passes and all believe that Revan has died, abandoning the Republic for some idealistic crusade in the Unknown Regions. Rumors are spreading, however, that Revan has returned with a massive fleet. For what purpose is yet to be determined.

**Name:** Jace Cloudspinner
**Race:** Human
**Age:** 23
**Gender:** Female
**Appearance:** Sporting shoulder length blonde hair, Jace is slim at her 5'7" stature. When she looks at you with her green eyes. you get the sense she can knows what you are thinking. Wearing a black tanktop and pants, a blaster rifle is usually found slung across her back.

Once belonging to Jace's father,Jorus Dravvad, the ship has obviously seen better days. The once brilliant silver and blue paint scheme has been chipped away over the last few years of use and disrepair. When Jorus had died, the ship had fallen under control of the Republic who had used it for their purposes till one day Jace arrived to claim her inheritance from her father. Not having the heart to just sell the ship, she fixed it up as best she could, buying the droid Crash to assist. Though more often than not, the both feel like there's always more to be done.
Jorus had modified the ship. No longer having the med bay, it was converted into a private cabin for the captain and the two crew dormitories now contain more living space holding two crew per dorm.
An ad-hoc medical bed was inserted into the wall of the communications room, to be folded out when needed. Medical supplies are kept in cabinets spread out along the opposite wall.
**Weapons:**
Double Laser Cannon (pilot)
Quad Laser Cannon, heavy (gunner)
Blaster Cannon Docking Gun (co-pilot)

I´m interested in trying out a freeform game, but if it´ll be run a lot in the chat rooms, or other real-time environments, I´m feeling like I won´t be able to participate a lot, given time differences etc...
But if it´s PbP, then I am surely interested.

**Name:**Zeisan Sumisu
**Race:**Human
**World:**
**Age:**28
**Gender:**Male
**Appearance:**Zeisan is 6'2" and about 190 lb. Normally he wears his dark gray armor and keeps it on until he thinks he can trust someone enough to show them his face. The face plate of his armor is a blueish-green and he always has a heavy pistol strapped to his right thigh. When going into combat, or just a new area that he does not trust, he carries his heavy rifle with him as well. Under the armor he has bright green eyes and short, black, messy hair and a scar that starts at his right temple and runs down the side of his face to his jaw bone.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-02 12:51:34)

**Name:** Trae
**Race:** Near-Human (Prandian)
**World:** Prandia
**Age:** 19
**Gender:** Male
**Appearance:** Tall, tan, and blonde with warm hazel eyes, Trae seems to have the looks and bearing of a somebody rather than a nobody, but it seems that a nobody is what he is. He usually wears the overalls and trappings of a mechanic. Still, he is no scruffy nerfherder, and barring a few smudges he may have missed Trae usually looks presentable enough, with clean nails and skin and his hair tied neatly back.
**Personality:** Trae is handsome, confident, eloquent, and charming; most who meet him can hardly believe he is a person of such non-importance. But he seems happy enough, at least outwardly. In more private moments he can be maudlin, but the company of friends always seems to revitalise his flagging spirits.
**Abilities:** Trae is a charming and skilful speaker, and has competitive abilities as a marksman and a fencer. He is capable as a mechanic.
Weapons: heavy blaster pistol, vibrofoil, archaic foil (which he never removes from its sheath).
**Bio:** Trae is like many in the *Star Wars* galaxy - he has a past that haunts him. His, it has to be said, is probably up there among the top few reasons to run from your past. He is in fact the exiled Prince of Prandia, Amrahil Elessin, wanted for the murder of his father by poisoning. In fact, he did no such thing, framed (not that he knows it) by his younger brother and the now Crown Prince's accomplices.
Fortunately for Amrahil, he had many friends in the Capital who believed in his innocence and his escape was arranged and implemented before he could be executed. He is now on the run, and goes by whatever name and made up background strike his fancy. Currently he is Trae, a charming warrior who occasionally fights on duelling circuits, but spends most of his time as a mechanic's assistant.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-01-02 19:10:35)

**Name:** Jason Ranchett
**Race:** Human
**World:** Originally from Corellia, but arrived on Dantooine at age 2
**Age:** 27
**Gender:** Male
**Appearance:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

![Jedi_Shadow.jpg](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v713/WigginsTheBurninator/Jedi_Shadow.jpg)

</details>

**Personality:** A very open person, Jason can sometimes be seen as almost carefree or oblivious. While he usually don´t trouble himself too much with smaller details of the everyday life, he is quite responisible when it comes to his assignment at hand. Whether it´s Corellian blood, or just lack of control, Jason can be quite impulsive and reckless, often acting far before he thinks. He is confident to a fault, and luckily he has been gifted with enough skills to see himself through the things he gets himself into.
**Abilities:** Jason has shown great promise as a Jedi Knight, and great potential in the Force, especially when it comes to telekinetic abilities, and the more sensory aspects of the Force. He has also proven to be a very gifted swordsman, besting many more experienced knights in lightsaber combat.
**Weapons:** Twin Lightsabers that can be joined together to form a double-bladed saber. Blades are Viridian and Aqua in color.
**Bio:** Delivered by parents who wished a better life for their son than they could offer, Jason came to the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine at the age of 1. Already from the start, he showed great promise, and the masters were amazed by the potential of the youth. Something else they were amazed by was his impulsive and reckless nature. To remedy this, they assigned his as the padawan of one of the most patient masters in the order, Gavin Hassar. And slowly but steadily, Gavin started to mold some sense of restraint and control into the young padawan.
By the time the Mandalorian Wars broke out, Jason´s training was nearly complete. When he heard about the Jedi joining Revan's cause and fighting the invaders, his first instinct was to join them and fight the fight for those that could not defend themselves. But Gavin halted him, and confessed to him that this was the Council's final trial for him. To prove worthy of the rank of Jedi Knight, he had to control himself, and realize the reason behind the Council's inaction. Still not convinced, Jason remained on Dantooine. At the war's end, he was knighted, and shortly after, Gavin vanished without a trace. No one seemed to know where he had gone to, and Jason was worried. His worries were subdued however, when he received his first assignment from the Council. To find out what had become of Revan and his followers, and investigate the rumors of their return.
*I was thinking a character possessing similar Force Potential as Starkiller, although far from as skilled and adept at using it, but developing over time, and sometimes exploding in bursts of extreme powers, like blasting an opponent through a wall, or crushing huge vehicles or objects to dust. Only when it makes necessary sense of course*

This would only be possible if and only when you rolled for an exceptional yes and it was a nearly impossible task. MEaning it would happen few and far between if ever. If you want to play a super powered JEdi, find another game none of us are going to put up with it. It was mentioned as one of the game rules that there were to be no extremely powerful characters.
I'm afraid the character as you have written him is not the type we're looking for in this game. Feel free to submit a more realistic character.

### **Alicia** (2010-01-02 23:06:20)

I added a description and some basic information concerning the Angel to my character post. Let me know if you think more needs to be provided.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-01-06 10:14:59)

hehe Simply, you called Jace Marina. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-06 11:15:04)

I have a character concept to run by y'all, with a profile to follow if you're good with the basic idea.
Soren Constant is a human Padawan who is close to finishing his training and undergoing the trials. He is a naturally friendly sort with a wry sense of humor and a quick mind. His manner matches his last name very well; he is so serene he makes some masters look excitable. As far as the mechanical stuff goes, I'm thinking he'd be more of a saber combatant than a force power user, but in any case he won't be a powerhouse because of the nature of the freeform game.
He and his master have spent much of the past several years (including all of the Mandalorian Wars) on the Outer Rim breaking up pirate fleets and other criminal syndicates that have tried to take advantage of the Republic's weakness. He is currently separated from his master (they were running down leads in separate systems) and needs to get off the planet to rejoin him. This could give him a reason to board the *Reluctant Angel,* he presumably has access to some Republic funds to pay for passage, and should chaos ensue because of Revan, he'll probably need to stick with the ship for a while.
What do you think?

### **Alicia** (2010-01-06 13:15:49)

I like what you have up so far. Can't wait to see a profile. Please be aware the party is currently on tattooine. Anchorhead I believe specifically

### **Vash** (2010-01-06 13:37:24)

Hey we need a Jedi in the group, nothing like a Jedi finding out that he's sharing a room with a former mando <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: --> Now be quick and get a profile up.

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-06 13:52:00)

Will try to get a profile posted ASAP...mired in a couple of projects right now, won't get to it until the evening at the earliest.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-06 13:57:47)

Jedi apprentices, unwitting Force-sensitives, ex-Mandalorians, and princes on the run.
I smell a sitcooom!

---

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-14 13:44:59)

OK...sorry for the delay. Let me know what you think:
**Name:** Soren Constant
**Race:** Human
**Age:** 20
**Gender:** Male
**Appearance:** Soren is perhaps a centimeter or two above average height, with a medium build, medium brown hair and dark brown eyes. He wears his hair somewhat long and has a full beard. He dresses in the simple tunics and robes favored by the Jedi, and he blends in well on the Rim worlds where he has spent most of his training years.
**Personality:** He is a naturally friendly sort with a wry sense of humor and a quick mind. His manner matches his last name very well; he is so serene he makes some Jedi masters look excitable. However, he's also too dependent on Master Loro, not intellectual and too cautious both in his tactics and in his interpersonal relationships. He has no real friends, and his only companions have been his master and one woman he is trying to forget.
**Abilities:**  Though strong in the Force, Soren stands out as an excellent pilot, tactician and investigator and is a lethal lightsaber combatant. He tends to be a bit overspecialized toward his crime-busting duties and is trying to become more well-rounded and intellectually curious.
**Weapons and equipment:** Two blue lightsabers, utility belt, datapad, short range comlink, personal holoprojector, 2 rolls of mesh tape
**Bio:** Soren was a promising student of the Force, and was chosen as a padawan by the human master Sing Loro. He will soon be ready to face the trials and become a full-fledged knight.
Soren and his master have spent much of the past several years (including all of the Mandalorian Wars) on the Outer Rim breaking up pirate fleets and other criminal syndicates that have tried to take advantage of the Republic's weakness. He is currently separated from his master (they were running down leads in separate systems) and needs to get off Tatooine to rejoin him.

### **Vash** (2010-01-14 15:02:36)

I think it looks good, I only have one question. How involved was your guy in the mando wars?

---

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-14 18:34:07)

Good question. He wasn't involved at all, his master was one of the Jedi who agreed with the council that the Jedi should sit the war out. Plus, the war gave a lot of scum opportunities to expand their territory while the Republic and the Jedi were distracted, so Soren and Sing Loro were needed more than ever.
If you're asking how he'll feel about your mando character, I think he'll feel conflicted but his self-control will win out.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-01-14 18:35:39)

Character looks good to me as well, feel free to introduce him when you feel the opportunity presents itself.
Please include the listing for your character's flaws and everything should be set.

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-14 19:08:14)

OK...made some edits to the personality and ability section to add flaws. Hope y'all don't think I was trying to bring Mr. Perfect into the party. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->
I'm writing up an entrance and will post it tonight.

IF anyone was still interested in participating, now would be the time to introduce your character in the game to become a passenger.

### **Anonymous** (2010-02-03 18:08:38)

Name: Kumiko Sanagi
Race: Human
World: None (?)
Age: 18
Gender: female
Appearance: Her skin is a light tan, which seems to never gets any darker or lighter, no matter how much or how little time she spends in the sun. Her eyes are a soft, light blue, and her hair is a dark, rich brown. She often keeps it tied up into a loose bun or ponytail, with the bangs loose and choppy about her face. She is rather short at just barely 5' 2", and is rarely found without wearing her trademark black boots. She usually is found wearing a grey tanktop, with black pants, and a dark green jacket. She wears a silver chain about her neck, from which dangles a small metal charm in the shape of a wing.
Personality: She is somewhat quiet, and gets embarrassed easily. She tends to be nervous, and shy, with this only being shown further when in groups. She can get somewhat hyper and silly, when she is in a good mood. Generally friendly, she often will strike up conversations out of curiousity, or ask alot of questions.
Abilities: She's been trained as a mechanic, and is very good with her hands.
Weapons: one custom blaster, that she keeps locked in her toolbox; a pair of daggers.
Flaws: She can be very stubborn at times, and also can become overly shy, especially in groups. Tends to act on her emotions, and not think things through. Also, she lacks fighting experience. Her curiousity sometimes comes across as prying, or being intrusive.
Bio:
Her family worked with a company with manufactured ship parts. They specialized in fixing, and repairing the ships that delivered the parts to wherever was needed. Her father had been killed in a nasty accident, but she'd been too little to remember, and her mother never spoke of him since. In fact, when she turned two years old, she was given away to an uncle. Her mother only telling him, that having the daughter, brought up too many painful memories, and she couldn't raise a child on a ship.
The Uncle, though not trusted, was the only family they had, and so the child's custody fell to him. He resented it at first, not being very good with kids. But she was very quiet, and curious about his work. You see, he tried to keep it hidden from her, and never brought it home. This went on for about two years of awkwardness, before she snuck aboard his ship, stead of staying in port with the man who was supposed to watch her. It was that day she found out his real occupation. Her uncle was a parts dealer. He was part of a close - knit ring of bandits, nicknamed the the Falcons. They specialized in collecting scraps from battle and repairs, and were known near the port, they usually hung around. Though a mostly unknown group, they didn't care about fame, or lots of money, and instead took care of each other.
When she snuck aboard, she was caught by one of the bandits, and brought before the rest of the group. Her uncle claimed her upon seeing who she was, and asked her what she was doing here. "I want to know more about you." she told him simply at the time, and with wide eyes. The bandits teased him a little, at first about his new apprentice, but she was allowed to go with him on the regular, less serious missions from then on.
She found her niche as a mechanic. Being quiet, she was polite enough, but didn't talk much, not having much to say. Her uncle refused to let her be a female escort, and so she took to learning how things were put together instead. It gave her a sort of gentle pride when she got things right, and the other mechanics were happy for the curious company. They taught her all they knew, and let her figure out more for herself. She spends alot of time reading manuals when not working, and can repair ships fairly easily.
Though she's happy with her adopted family, and uncle, she has an urge to go on an adventure. She wants to go somewhat unfamiliar, see new ships, and worlds. Though she doubts she ever will, and tries to be content with what she's got. She's licensed, having been tested, and can work just about anywhere.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-02-03 21:21:32)

She seems like a good character and I don't have a particular objection to another mechanic joining the group. If Alicia and Vash are for it then she can be directed toward Trae in the cantina. It'll give the poor bored soul something to do. :]

### **Alicia** (2010-02-03 21:36:32)

Same here Kara. You have my go ahead to write up your intro post.

### **Anonymous** (2010-02-17 17:04:12)

Hey guys! My hard drive blew up, so I'll be gone until this weekend.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-09-04 18:32:03)

Simply, Vash and I will be looking to getting this started again from the port of Nar Shadaa. Should anyone be interested go ahead and start putting through character profiles.
