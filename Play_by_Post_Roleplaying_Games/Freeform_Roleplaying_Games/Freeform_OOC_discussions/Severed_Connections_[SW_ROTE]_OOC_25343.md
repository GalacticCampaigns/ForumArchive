I really hate playing PM tag, especially when more than one person needs to be involved in replies. Hense why I FINALLY made an OOC chat for the game. Wasn't needed before as BW and I conversed mostly over gTalk and Steam behind the scenes, making this unnecessary.
Darth, feel free to make use of the Character Profile section or your blog to post your character information. It really doesn't matter to us. I just advise one of those two places as things tend to get lost or forgotten in OOC chats.

Good call Alicia. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->
The only thing I would add is that it might behoove you to read [Marina&#39;s Story](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=25091 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=25091"), [Marina&#39;s other story](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=25175 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=25175") (but we sort of both agreed that this didn't really go well and probably ought to be forgotten almost entirely... lol), [Marina&#39;s other other story](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=173&t=25235 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=173&t=25235"), and, of course, [the current thread](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=173&t=25336 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=173&t=25336").
You don't have to read *all* of those things obviously, except maybe the current one which isn't that long yet, but it just might help in terms of thinking up a character. Currently, Nadia is dining with Commander Chayse aboard *Vendetta* which, among other things, contains a rather large and varied assortment of prisoners that he will be returning to Imperial authorities soon - so maybe making a character that, for whatever reason, was captured and is currently imprisoned within the ship would be easier to introduce - but do whatever you like, we'll work it out. And yes, it's true, I don't bother with stat sheets for my NPCs really, and even calling this "freeform" simply allows for us to say "**Okay, there's eleven Stormtroopers and Mr. Critical, the bounty hunter. No rolling required for beating down the stormies but please roll for Mr. Critical.**"
I'm usually reachable via PM - I'm less technologically available than Alicia. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

Hope you don't mind BW, but I moved the PM you sent me to be on here as it was mainly directed to Darth and he wasn't listed as a recipient.
I've also linked quite a bit of resources in the fist post of this thread, including the threads you mentioned in the PM/post.

Fair enough - and maybe Darth will get to meet Captain Steel! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
My mom will be leaving today when I head to work early, but my eldest *may* have caught the Plague that we've all been passing around for the last couple weeks and my brother decided to visit later this week. I have Friday off but then I'm working Saturday morning. What this means, for those of you new to **BW Syndrome**, is that I probably won't have much of a post up for a while yet. I tried to get something done last night but we visited until my mom literally *fell asleep in the middle of a conversation*... so I took that cue to catch some sleep as well. It won't happen today but I may be able to work a post in tomorrow before work. All that to say - you've got plenty of time to come up with a character and ask questions and stuff. My experience with play-by-post, and RP in general, began when Amazon suggested I check out **Star Wars Saga Edition** a couple years ago. I don't have much of a life and while the idea appealed to me I wasn't sure that I had anyone to play with. I looked around online and found **sagaedition.com** (closed now), lurked a couple days, picked up the core book, and joined a game. I posted that my character leaned against a wall and then the others left the game. I looked for another game on the site and got in trouble for copying a portion of the rules and citing it in discussion about hp. By "trouble" I mean I was warned by one of the admins, which wasn't a big deal but I was sort of miffed and wandered the 'Net until I found **GalacticCampaigns**. I joined one of DA's solo games, then skirmish-y solo game, and then one of Alicia's games, and then GM'd my own game where they all joined as players - so we've all got a decent feel enough for how each other plays. Marina's game started two years ago so we have a pretty decent story all worked out too, despite this being really the first game I've ever GM'd and definitely the longest.
The community here is wicked awesome for helping out new folks (to pbp or RP/SWSE in general) and the site is pretty much the best out there honestly. We've got a dice roller code, statblock calculator thing that works decently, and an Artoo smilie. What else could you want?

### **Darthsaibot** (2013-03-27 03:33:57)

I'm so sorry about the late response, not only have i been very busy with work, I've been milling over my first pbp character cause I want it to be memorable. Between Nadia and BeeDee most skills are taken care of except perhaps treat injury, got a few ideas for field medics or doctors. Any restrictions on force sensitivity? Can I make a Dathomiri night brother trained Zabrak force sensitive scout/soldier or Jedi/bounty hunter? But I'm very flexible, maybe a Trandoshan field medic turned surgeon? Or a Mon-Calomari scientist/survivor on his way to becoming a bounty hunter?

### **Darthsaibot** (2013-03-27 08:51:28)

Breathing deeply, Sang shifted his weight from his bruised shoulder to his less bruised hip, easing himself into a semblance of comfort. Not an easy task with only a few feet to stretch out, his current cell was not meant to hold anyone for extended periods. He believed it was meant as some kind of torture chamber "Or an execution chamber," he muttered darkly to the ventilation panels in the wall.
He cursed himself for a fool for what seemed the hundredth time for the path of idiocy he had walked to get himself beaten by his captors. His anger had not served him as his teachers had said it would, they had preached the power that would come. Power to vanquish his enemies, power to take what was his due. And he had watched them all die screaming. His masters, his friends, his family. Anger and striking out against your captors was not the way to survive, his flying emotions had not served him well, had not given him strength, or power or broken his chains. Just a few more scars to add to his collection. His instincts had kept him alive since the empires ships had rained fire from the sky onto his home in Dathomir, the rage and anger that had been his life bread and lessons as a child had done naught for those who embraced it. Only led them to their demise, that was what had shaken his beliefs. After three years surviving on his own in the jungle, the silence and tranquility along with the purity of existence that time had helped to heal his damaged psyche.
He had never really had a friend since coming to the spice mines. As strange place as any to get acquainted with anyone, but many came, and kept coming and if you we're not accepting of many discomforts you were a danger to everyone.
A vision of Garn, his first friend flashed in his head, hands slightly raised as if to tell Sang to be ready, His balding head shining in the dim light. It was strange for Sang to have befriended a human, they were the key race of the empire, held all the power and were symbols of oppression. But in the spice mines of Kessle, the slaves were all the same. Any race, gender, colour, creed or history, everyone starved, suffered and died. Humans included.
He did not think he had killed the Rodian, which mean't that he would probably try to kill Sang. "So be it," he thought, living was overrated. Still, the group of 'friends' he had attracted in the mines seemed to look up to him, even care about him. The slaves in the Kessle mines had very little to lose but a lot in common. And he would gladly do it again, not just because it was good to feel bones and cartilage crack beneath your blows, because children, slave or not, should not be treated as whores. Thinking of the two-lek girl Nima bought a slight smile to his lips, he had managed to keep her fed well enough that that she was attracting attention. Maybe this attention would get her out of here, whatever awaited her on the outside had to be better than this.
Foot steps in the hall brought him back to the present. His sat up painfully, ready for what was to come.

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-27 10:34:42)

A few things for reference, I'm not sure if you've picked them up from Alicia or around the site or whatnot:
**1)** The year is 4BBY. I'm not sure if we mentioned that explicitly in *Severed Connections*.
**2)** General site guidelines for consistency are **bold** for speaking, *italics* for thoughts/interior monologue, and normal text for everything else. Use a spoiler for any OOC (well, aside from this thread I guess, it's just easier to have it with the post I think) or rolling. If you need help with the bbcode just ask, it's pretty easy to get the hang of.
**3)** [This](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/faq.php "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/faq.php") is also a good page to check out if you haven't already.
**4)** There's a instant template you can use for character sheets from the pull-down tab thing when you make a post. Since this is a little different for a freeform, it might be better to post it on your blog (yeah, you get one of those here too... I told you this site rocks). We can help with that once you have a sheet.
> Between Nadia and BeeDee most skills are taken care of except perhaps treat injury, got a few ideas for field medics or doctors&#8230;Or a Mon-Calomari scientist/survivor on his way to becoming a bounty hunter?

My first inclination is to just tell you to make what you want. It's your first pbp character so it *will* be memorable, no matter what I'm sure. I still remember my guy that only got one post on that other site. It's 4BBY and that means there's still lots of possibilities anyway.
> Any restrictions on force sensitivity?

I think we've pretty much just been following RAW (Rules As Written) for this. Dark Side points are allowed at your discretion I believe, since we're not going to *force* you to take them... pun intended... but you should definitely get them for obvious things (killing an innocent, etc.).
So let me make this recommendation: Let's see your character sheet first, with a decent background and level breakdown (take a look at Marina or Nadia or [Modo](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/blog.php?u=2810&b=80 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/blog.php?u=2810&b=80") for formatting options), and then you can edit this post or write a new one after we kick around some ideas. If you need to make a couple, or at least write up a couple background ideas, that's fine - post them and we can work stuff out. I'm on Steam - same username - if you find yourself there often. I'll put up gChat as well... username i.am.bws2k (I think I probably had my original name but forgot the password, to be honest). Alicia and I sometimes chat about these things for weeks before making a big post, so don't feel rushed.
I don't know what you're past experience is with RPing but we all approach it differently and what works for one might not work for another. Play-by-posting is a nice opportunity to craft some nice responses to situations and really get into character - to tell a collaborative story in true, as opposed to needing to have a more instant response to events in-person and have someone keeping track of notes. It means things go by slowly sometimes, like combat might take a few days, but we can usually catch each other in chat if we really need to, otherwise whoever's GMing can just fudge things and fast forward unless it's ultra-critical to roll or whatever. That's why we have that pseudo-rule about NPC fodder: you'll notice that right now in the story Karn has just been escorted out by "a trio of stormtroopers" while Nadia is finishing up with Commander Chayse and RA-5. These guys, if she chose to attack them, would result in a little more drawn out combat than if she said "BW, I wanted to do a flying jumpkick into that first stormie!" I'd just be like "Okay, go nuts!" because we're playing characters that should have little problem taking out minions, and because combats should be meaningful and not redundant and she's on a Star Destroyer where that could get tedious (despite her knack for *avoiding* combat...).
I think I'm talking too much, so I'll go for now. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

That's my first Skyrim character's name, he's Argonian and I played him for about 53 hours before losing interest and wanting to try a different build. I do that a lot, start things over. Like... a lot.
You can also just type [*dice]1d20+4[*/dice] without the *'s and this site will roll for you, but you won't see it until you submit the post (it's not in the previews). My phone is about seven years old, so it doesn't really roll dice. Or play videos. Or recognize the internet.

I think we did forty-point buys actually, and you'd have to separate those out into individual rolls: [*dice]4d6[*/dice] would be one, then do it again on another line for another, etc.
Was it forty points, Alicia? Or thirty-eight?

### **Darthsaibot** (2013-03-28 08:43:34)

Alright here goes, I still think there's a couple of things I need to touch up, the skills for instance. Also, with this build Grim will have the opportunity to reroll perception twice but having to take the second (or third) result due to his racial ability and the pre-requisite for the awareness talent tree, which is just lame. So I took the liberty of a rule supliment I read in 'Shadow Warriors' house rules. Therefore Uncanny dodge I would be available to Zabraks and Cereans at level 3. Please advise BeeDub if this is unexceptable. Also I concentrated alot on the 'Survival' side of statistics. Hopefully he can meet someone whom can teach him to utilise his inner strengths in order to fight back.

Background <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

To have seen him as a child, one would have said that Grimm was robbed of child-hood. A skinny, snarling violent little creature was the orange skinned, tattoo-less Zabrak, destined for murder and violence. Having been brought up in the dark jungles of Dathomir, brainwashed into believing himself to be the next dark prodigy to wreak havoc on the Jedi, and that the only way to become this was through self-discipline, merciless conflict with his 'brothers', masichism to overcome your boundries and dark magic, one could also say he had the right start.
He had not even reached double digits though when the bombs fell. His Grandmaster Ar'Chook had said it was that the Empire feared the Night Brothers, that their time was coming to rule. He had stood high on the masters stand, the place used to address the students, had raised his Zhaboka and screamed his defiance to the skies and the descending tie bombers. His brothers had done the same, and they had all burned. Burned screaming.
And Zur Grimm had run, he had run for hours before he collapsed of exhaustion, and then he awoke and he ran again. He ran for days to get away from the glassed remains of his home, living on what food and water he could scavange all the time a burning hatred of the empire beat in his breast.
But a half-decade on your own can change a man, or a boy in this case, and in the spring of his fifteenth year he was encountered by explorers. They had come in search of a new home. Hungry and frightened were they all, Twi-leks, Sullustans, Bothans and others - even some humans - had landed nearby and started building. Having always been taught that strangers brought weakness and disease, that they should be mercilessly slaughtered, Grimm surprised even himself by his curiosity. Offering food to a hunter that had gotten himself lost, a curing poultice to a curious scientist that had strayed too closely to a nasty pollen, then he had saved two lovers that had been set-upon by the local wlild-life injuring himself in the process. Tales of his exploits been spread through the settlement and he was taken back without delay. Although quite extensive, his wounds were far from crippling or fatal and so he stayed some weeks with the settlers making aquaintances and even friends with some.
When the Trandoshan slave ship attacked he fought as brutally as he knew how, but his and everyone elses enslavement was inevitable. And so he was shipped to the Spice mines of Kessle.

### **Darthsaibot** (2013-03-28 10:00:19)

Oh yeah I changed his name too sorry, which do you like best Alicia? Sang or Grimm? Sang means Shaman, Grimm is archaic for farmer but stems from 'futility'.
Also I'm not really sure how to save my characters, little help?

---

### **Alicia** (2013-03-28 10:14:10)

Save it?
If you mean put it somewhere else, either click to Scott your post or quote it.
Copy (Ctrl+c on your keyboard) and then open up either the blog from the site's nav menu or go to the character profiles section of the free form forum.
There you can post it and keep it from being lost.
Could you please link to any house rules you might have implemented. It's general courtesy to discuss such things rather than just taking it into your own hands. Especially for the sake of consistency if would effect everyone, including NPCs.

Just read the background. When I hear Grimm I think of the fairy tales and his history reminds me a bit of that.
It won't stop me from being reminiscent of them though... Lol. A name is a personal choice. If it works for the character then by all means.
Nadia for example means hope.

Nice I like that.
I've sent you a pdf of shadowarriors house rules to your gmail account, but I wasn't trying to be pushy, is was just a suggestion. Actually there are a few good ones in there.

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-28 11:24:02)

At my very first glance I think your **Ranged** modifier should be at least a **+2** because it includes your Dexterity (p.144, *Core Book*) modifier, and for a 15 that's **+2** (p.18, *Core Book*). Right now if I look at your ability scores, the point values I come up with exactly forty - but at level four you get two +1's to put on any ability scores you like, so don't sell yourself short there. I'll take a better look at the numbers and such later on tonight but I really like the background. I like both names and since the examples of Zabrak names in the Core Book have two names together, you might use both? Grimm Sang? No worries.
One thing I want to make sure of though - you're wanting to start in Kessel? It might be easier to have spent some time in Kessel and are currently being transported, or have just been captured and are now being transported to Kessel, since we can have you on the ship right away. If that's not your preference, that's fine, but it'll be tricky to get us all together.
Cool cool, I'll be back later. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

So what rules did you use out of this exactly?
HP should be max.
Credits I don't think we're really tracking at start as long as you don't go overboard.
The only ones I'm concerned about are under the species category.

### **Darthsaibot** (2013-03-28 12:20:43)

The only rule i suggested was the cross over for racial abilities and feats that do the same thing.
Chapter II – Species
Page 22: If a species possesses a trait that is functionally the same as a class talent, such as the Sullustan
Heightened Awareness and the Scout class Acute Senses, the species trait can substitute for the
class talent wherever the talent is needed as a prerequisite for gaining other class talents.
But as I said there are a few in there that I like, Gm's word is final though.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-03-28 12:55:13)

Thing is all three of us are technically GMs as at any given time we'll be leading the story.
I'm not sure I'm keen on that rule in particular. Let me think on it after I've done some research.

### **Alicia** (2013-03-28 15:19:03)

OK... Here's my thoughts concerning using racial abilities in the place of feats/talents.
I'm against it for the simple reason that is unbalanced. While there are instances where a character during the course of leveling has taken a talent or feat which allows them to meet the prerequisites for others, for example, taking Force Pilot and being able to then meet the prerequisite for Vehicular combat. But in the end all these instances are abilities the character has earned, rather than given.
In the example of the house rule, that's a talent level ability that's being skipped over. Most Talents are tiered like that for a reason.
Rerolls are powerful things by themselves. Yeah you have to take the second one, but generally you're rolling again for a reason. I wouldn't re roll for example if the dice was over a 10...
Anyways, I wouldn't allow it, but it's not just my decision alone.
BTW, I just realized there was more than one page to that doc you sent me... Over 10 pages?! He rewrite the rules or something?! <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

BW. Writing this post I so want to say when she parts ways with Chayse 'for good':
"I'll give my mother your regards."
Makes me giggle thinking about it.

Well then it looks like Grim is going to be very perceptive.
But don't you think think that is what you have done with the Armored Defense and Improved Armored Defense rules? That way you can dip into Soldier for one level and suddenly be wearing stormy armor like you had spent the last 12 months training in it. That's taking out two levels of Sodier or Jedi knight.
Those re-rolls are really not that powerfull when other races get Skill Focus or Force Sensitivity as a bonus, but hey, I'm a Noob.
I also think that having those two re-rolls is just plane boring, obviously i've wanted to play a force sensitive Zabrak Bounty Hunter for some time. Concerning the pre-requisites for the Prestige classes, that is unchanged.

In my opinion you're not comparing apples to apples. While the racial ability is the same bonuses as a talent it however is not.
As for armor defense, wotc technically made the first move in combining the talents by making the imperial knight in the Legacy SB. Many people just took what they thought was a logical next step and combined the soldier armor talents.

**I.** So you're basically saying that, per page one of SW's House Rules, you've allowed the Zabrak species bonus "*Heightened Awareness*" to serve as the "*Acute Senses*" talent.
Hmm.
Well here's my thought on that one: I think it's a cop out, and I wouldn't say that lightly about something Shado compiled. I had the opportunity to read through some of his games and he's a *fantastic* GM and, I believe, actually helped contribute to one of the source books. He's a really good guy and I understand why this would be a logical thing to do, but I've always understood these sorts of re-rolls to be rolled *after* discovering if you've failed. So if the GM asks you to roll and you get a 7 and he says, "Nope." you can re-roll. Maybe you get a 2, which of course is still a failure and counts but it's unlikely that accepting something lower is going to hurt you much more than your first failure, so it's a safe gamble to take. You could roll higher though, and that's the perk. With allowing them to stack (Heightened Awareness *and* Acute Senses), you're getting *three* chances to get the roll. If you roll twice and the GM says, "You did it!" then you wouldn't really want to roll again, unless you had some sort of specific goal in mind beyond acing the DC. I don't know if that makes sense or not, it's just the only way I've understood those abilities/talents to be of any use. All that to say I don't think it's a good House Rule for us for two reasons: 1) What I just said, 2) We're freeforming anyway - it's unlikely that you'll fail a Perception check that leads to catastrophe unless you want it to. I can't speak for Alicia, but I don't really like killing my players. I like scaring them a little maybe, to make things fun, but GMing in a game like this isn't so much about rules as it is telling the story and using the rules to keep things interesting.
**II.** Can you give me a heads up on where the Conditioning feat comes from?
**III.** "I'll give my mother your regards." - I'll see what I can do Nadia... <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
**IV.** "T*hose re-rolls are really not that powerfull when other races get Skill Focus or Force Sensitivity as a bonus, but hey, I'm a Noob.*" - I agree that some races are superior to others in terms of perks and whatnot, but there's more to be taken into consideration. We're playing during the height of the Empire, for instance, and humanoids are going to be much better at hiding/disguising than someone like a Wookie, even though a Wookie gets that awesome rage mode. Stuff like that just depends on the story more than anything else.
V. "*Concerning the pre-requisites for the Prestige classes, that is unchanged.*" - I disagree, but only because of what I said above about my disdain of that House Rule. Obvious Solution is obvious: Just take some time to tweak your build a little bit and go to CL6 instead. My PC, being introduced shortly, is CL6 - I think Nadia is CL5 only because she's so young. An extra level doesn't make a tremendous difference in what we're doing (which should sound frighteningly ominous to you, not childishly flippant) and it could easily allow you to grab your three Awareness talents. Since you look to be just about Nadia's age at present however, I might add a few more years to represent the experience. I think Modo is about thirty-years-old. Somewhere in the mid-twenties would probably suffice for a character like Grimm to have those skills/talents/etc. Just don't forget to add in your extra ability bonuses and double-check those attack modifiers. A level breakdown is supremely helpful in this endeavor.
**VI.** I like your background but I'm interested in a couple things: 1) You're shooting for a bounty hunter - what kind? The loner, brooding and scheming and such, or someone a little more noble in his contracts? Something says he might only take contracts on slavers or Trandoshans or something since that's how he got caught. Just something I was curious about. 2) You've got him on Kessel, which I think I mentioned before, but it isn't really anywhere close to where we are currently. It might be best to have him on his way to Kessel, or perhaps in transit from Kessel to be interrogated elsewhere, or maybe he escaped Kessel and just got re-captured... actually, that might be cool. Keep your story that he got captured by slavers and sent to Kessel but then add your extra Character Level and up his age a bit to represent years spent in the mines. Write up a little something about how he managed to escape and was only recently recovered...? Could be cool. I dunno, your call.
Okay, it's late and I spent about an hour reading and writing this all up. Apologies if it's unclear - let me know your thoughts on that stuff. I totally appreciate being new to this and there are still some little things I don't completely understand about SWSE at times. Similar to your observation about Heightened Awareness being the same as Acute Senses, it irks me that it takes, like, three feats just to successfully pin someone in combat. Seems excessive to me, but my screename is all caps so... <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: -->

Okay there's some good arguments there against SWs substitution house rule, and i think I'll do some tweaking when I get home.
BeeDub, you and me are on the same page about Grims age though, and that was the plan, for him to have been in the mines for a couple o years and then transported, maybe because someone found out about his force sensitivity?

Thanks. You're basically making a re-roller, eh? <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
After I turned off my computer last night, I was thinking about that House Rule. I'm not saying this is what we should do now. I will say that if I was GMing my own game and someone wanted to stack Heightened Awareness and Acute Senses in an alternate way, I think I'd allow the option to just have a modifier to Perception rather than a re-roll. A consistent +2 to the roll, without any chance to re-roll, I feel, would accomplish the same thing while still following the pre-requisites and such. Just a thought, but not one I would say applies to us here without unanimous agreement.

### **Darthsaibot** (2013-03-29 16:37:26)

Nah, that's not needed. You were both very convincing. And yeah he has turned out to be a bit of a re-roller, but I think these stats suit his character

Background
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

To have seen him as a child, one would have said that Grimm was robbed of child-hood. A skinny, snarling violent little creature was the orange skinned, tattoo-less Zabrak, destined for murder and violence. Having been brought up in the dark jungles of Dathomir, brainwashed into believing himself to be the next dark prodigy to wreak havoc on the Jedi, and that the only way to become this was through self-discipline, merciless conflict with his 'brothers', masichism to overcome your boundries and dark magic, one could also say he had the right start.
He had not even reached double digits though when the bombs fell. His Grandmaster Ar'Chook had said it was that the Empire feared the Night Brothers, that their time was coming to rule. He had stood high on the masters stand, the place used to address the students, had raised his Zhaboka and screamed his defiance to the skies and the descending tie bombers. His brothers had done the same, and they had all burned. Burned screaming.
And Zur Grimm had run, he had run for hours before he collapsed of exhaustion, and then he awoke and he ran again. He ran for days to get away from the glassed remains of his home, living on what food and water he could scavange all the time a burning hatred of the empire beat in his breast.
But a half-decade on your own can change a man, or a boy in this case, and in the spring of his fifteenth year he was encountered by explorers. They had come in search of a new home. Hungry and frightened were they all, Twi-leks, Sullustans, Bothans and others - even some humans - had landed nearby and started building. Having always been taught that strangers brought weakness and disease, that they should be mercilessly slaughtered, Grimm surprised even himself by his curiosity. Offering food to a hunter that had gotten himself lost, a curing poultice to a curious scientist that had strayed too closely to a nasty pollen, then he had saved two lovers that had been set-upon by the local wlild-life injuring himself in the process. Tales of his exploits been spread through the settlement and he was taken back without delay. Although quite extensive, his wounds were far from crippling or fatal and so he stayed some weeks with the settlers making aquaintances and even friends with some.
When the Trandoshan slave ship attacked he fought as brutally as he knew how, but his and everyone elses enslavement was inevitable. And so he was shipped to the Spice mines of Kessle.
His fellow slaves learned to respect him, and it was only the truly fool-hardy of the guards that took a hand to him, he was a strong worker after all - and many had ended up with broken arms and legs tustling with the dangerous Zabrak.
He made few friends in the mines, learning quickly how cheap life could really be, the guards used to try to scare the new 'recruits' with recapping tales of how Kessel had the highest mortality rate in any place in the galaxy, and indeed many of the workers dies within weeks of their arrival. Many tried to escape, but if they made it to freedom Grim never heard about it. He was sure to note the failures heads that decorated the walls, though. Garn - that was the only name he gave - was Grims first and best friend, a human of venerable years who seemed to be able to always know what you were thinking. He also met the first Zabrak who had not tried to beat him to a pulp - an old man who volunteered to tattoo Grims Body. And so the designs Grim wears are from a forgotten family of Zabrak Nobility, whose lives were destroyed by the empires Tyrany.
Days turned to weeks, the weeks to months and soon the years were passing by quite regularly and so Kota Grimm grew from a wiry adolescent into a hard eyed man, cut from the stone he had mined for the last nine years. Garn, his friend and mentor, had fallen sick and had become dilerious, muttering that he "can not go, not ready yet..." Grimm was advised that Garn was old and dying, he could not expect him to be show complete sanity.
"Ifnye caaarnt gedth' faaarg up?" the abusive gamorreans voice was not unexpected, he was one of the few who could speak basic, he threatened a twi-lek woman who had fallen and was trying in vein to rise, "I'is gonna zplitt ye!" he brandished a rust spotted vibro-axe.
The woman tried to rise again and fell back weakly. A younger woman, maybe her daughter from the look, ran to her aid pleading to the Guard in Ryl. At the expression on the guards face looking at the young tender female he had no intention of making her go back to work.
He looked around, and motioned a Rodian over, conversing in a language Grim thought must have been Huttese. Grimm knew this was not going to end well. The Rodians eagerness was plain on his face, he had to keep wiping his muzzle from excess drool, and cupping the young girls chin in long greasy fingers he started speaking what he took for soothingly in a squeeky buzz.
An image of Garn with his hands raised telling Koda to wait flashed through his head "Be still, don't be bothered by one girl, this happens all the time and will keep happening and you know it." Garn had always had wise things to say, had always kept Grimm out of the worst of trouble. It did not even occur to him that he might be disappointed when Grimm suddenly found himself face to face with the oily Rodian.
It had happened so fast that, out of sheer startlement, the Rodian let go of the girl and stumbled backwards, his hands coming up as if to ward off a blow that was descending. Grimm stood expressonless, tattooed face and torso, carved and glistening with sweat in the dim light like an orange demon. Realising his fault in demeanor the Rodian straitened angrily snatching the stun baton from his belt, he yelled at Grimm to get back to work. Again the image of Garn "Step back, the girl is nothing, there are thousands of her! Do you mean to save them all?"
But Grimm stood motionless, just staring into the Rodians eyes, the Rodian faultered his mouth quivered and he shouted again, and again. By now they had attracted quite the croud, "I can only try," he answered Garn quietly, and was infused with and incredible feeling of relief, of loss, of hope of adulation and anguish. It filled him from his toe-nails and his crown of horns to the tip of his dark hair for just an instant, and even as it faded, a throb of it stayed. An essence of something more. The last he heard before blacking out was not the screams of the guards or the gasps of the slaves around them, it was the fading voice of his first friend "Now I can go..."
Grimm awoke to pain, his head and neck ached like he had been stomped upon, possibly he had been, but his surroundings were strange unfamiliar. He lay in a bed, of all things, it's sheets clean, white and smelling slightly of citrous. The room he was in was pristine and looked as if was reserved for only the very rich, it's walls draped in colourful holoportraits and complex mosaics, its shelvs lined with expensive decor. "Maybe I'm dead..." He tried to raise a hand to rub his aching skull and realised that he was strapped to the bed, a quick strength test of the straps told him that whoever had put huim there wanted him to stay.
A DD-13 medical droid hovered to the bedside examining him, and a short time later the pasteel door slid open, the man whom entered in long deliberate steps was one whom Grimm had only ever heard about.
Quinar Tagind was the head and Overseer of this whole section of the Kessle spice mines, anyone for a thousand miles jumped when he said 'Toad', it was said he was rich enough to buy planets, he was tall and heavily built - the armor and cloak he wore were not needed to make him intimidating. The vibro-sword he wore at his side swayed in step with his stride, as if an extention of his body. He was a powerful man and the back-hand he delivered Grimm rattled his teeth more than just a little.
"You are the one they call the 'Demon'? You will answer my questions, trash, or you will not see another dawn!" His snarl in so close a proximity to Grimms face caused more than a touch of spittle to spatter on him, "What is your name? From what region do you hale, and what is it about you that has an Imperial Star Destroyer, baring down on us!" the latter was less of a question and more of an accusation.
"Well!?" At Grimms silence another deafening backhand was delivered. "Answer me!"
"I haven't seen the dawn in nine years you pitiful weakling, what difference does it make to me if you burn in Imperial flame? The thought of it makes me smile. Unstrap me and see if you have the stones to make demands."
Taginds hand cocked to deliver another jaw-jarrer when a womans voice hailed over the intercom: "My Lord, a foreighn vessel, a Lambda Class baring an Imperial signature is seeking landing permission, less cordially than a request." Without another word Quinar Tagind spun on his heel and left.
It was an hour or so later when the DD-13 droid started tending to Grimms wounds. Bandages and bacta spay were applied in what Grimm would have taken for haste in a sentient, and shortly after the door slid open and Overseer Tagind strode in once again, if less aggressively this time, still with the air of needing to have been there an hour ago. As if the walls would fall and oceans would part for him. This time he was followed by somethign of a procession, however.
Striding after the Overseer were two ...men? Grimm considered them human, he had never seen the likes though, Draped completely in red robes and armor carrying electrostaffs vertically, they walked in unison. *Well trained whatever they are*, thought Grimm, and after a single being so very much like a human. Most likely male, of average height, with a bald and powdered head and dark make-up around it's striking milky eyes, it studied Grimm as you would something you'd just stepped in and found particularly foul. "Clean it, dress it and bring it aboard, you will be well compinsated for." Without another word it motioned the two red armored men to lead it outside, and followed with it's nose in the air.
Calling for some guards to see to the unshackling of Grimm Tagind once again strode out of the room. The shower in the fresher was very different from the weekly communal hose-down that the slaves usually recieved and it wasn't long before Grimm was clothed, fed and on his way to mending.
Once aboard the Lambda class shuttle Grimm was stowed in a make-shift cell, an old storage room of some description, shackled to the floor and confronted by the Umbarian. "I have saved you from your fate for one reason only," he started in his contralto voice "you are to serve the Empire. I know nothing of your current training but am interested to see what one of your Callibre will do in gratitude for he whom has saved his life..."
I was hoping that here, the ship can rendevou with the Vendetta? If not give me a heads up, and I'll give it a bit more. Does Grimm need to kill the Umbaran? that would be fun, I've modelled him after Sly Moore, force sensitive noble turned Force Disciple. He's a couple of levels above Grimm, but once the Zabrak gets a hold of him, the Umbaran is dead.

I confess my brain is pudding from work this morning, so I'll have a more constructive response for you later tonight hopefully. Just one question at the moment: Did you use the forty points to buy his abilities at Child level, and then have them fade? Because the forty points are for an adult. I don't know how the math works out though, and like I said... pudding... <!-- s8/ -->![8/](https://i.ibb.co/kVxpy8vX/icon-eek.gif)<!-- s8/ -->

### **Darthsaibot** (2013-03-30 17:54:14)

The forty points I calculated for an adult, took one point off each for young adult, and a further three points off both strength and con for his time as a child. Those penalties faded as he grew though, so his stats at lvl one are: str-15, dex-15, con-16, int-11, wis-14, cha-13

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-31 22:28:31)

Okay. I just read the background and I need to think on it a bit. I like it, I just have to consider how to mesh the stories in a way that flows.

Another possibility would be to just have you solo for a bit, then eventually get caught and brought aboard, though syncing up the two stories would defeat a lesser GM.

### **Alicia** (2013-04-01 10:29:37)

Ok.. so I had a thought last night before I went to sleep to get things moving a bit faster. You could still technically do a side thread if it would be easier, but at least this way things are set up for the characters to get together.
Before I get into that though I did have a comment about the last portion of your background. Realistically, I don't see a red guard and a member of Palpatine's court coming to the space mines to pick up a potential recruit. Not unless you did something very spectacular to get the Emperor's personal interest. So unless you really want the Emperor and Vader after you personally, I suggest you change that particular portion to an Inquisitor (who could potentially become like a Chayse to your character: someone with a grudge who wants pay back because you got away) and maybe a few stormtroopers. The Umbarian could be the Inquisitor as a Force Sensitive is a Force Sensitive if that's what you had in mind. The Red Guards were an issue with me as they are Palpatine's personal guards, which mean he is somehow pushing the strings to get you rather than the Inquisitors who actually helped Vader track down other Force Sensitves either to kill or recruit.
Here's a wiki page about them for further reading: <!-- m -->[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Inquisitorius](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Inquisitorius "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Inquisitorius")<!-- m -->
and the Red Guard: <!-- m -->[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Guard](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Guard "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Guard")<!-- m -->
My idea was essentially this.. The Lamba shuttle carrying Grimm encounters an engine malfunction (surprise) as they head back to their main base. The Vendetta picks them up, but as the [Inquisitor] begins to take over, Chayse may not like this a bit. Especially as the Inquisitor may then detect Nadia as well and want to take his glory away by not only bringing Grimm back but Nadia as well.
That's the basic idea. I have a lot more thought up in my head, but don't want to make it too specific as I know how you like to run things, BW. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

### **Darthsaibot** (2013-04-03 02:20:30)

Nice one Alicia, that's essentially what i was shooting for as well.
I did not, however realise the significance of the red robed guys, I just thought they were an elite unit of some description. Did you want a re-write? Because the last thing I want is to have the Emperor or Vader taking an interest. I did skip over quite a few details - I was gonna tie them up with a dream or an explanantion from Garn's spirit - the fallen Jedi he learned from in the spice mines. The reason for the bad guys suddenly becoming 'aware' was that Garn had sent a message through the force to them, in order to get Grimm out.
I was just leaving it open for BeeDub; he is, as you say Alicia, running the show.
Just another small inquisition, do you guys think that Grimm should have the 'Primitive' slot from his background, like a Gammorian? If so I could give him 'Improved Damage Threshold' as a replacement fro the lost weapon proficiencies. It wuold suit him, having a disdain - even contempt - for the use of blaster weapons because he views them as a weak substitute for a strong arm.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-04-03 04:45:48)

You don't have to go as far as rewriting it. Just change some details like making the Umbarian an Inquisitor and the Red Guard normal stormtroopers. Add whatever details you feel makes your character unique because it's the story that is important not your stats.
I could see many possibilities as to why they have become aware of Grimm, not limited to see them receiving reports from the mines or having detected him themselves.
Also, keep in mind that I've had Marina since 2009 so I've had a great deal of time to work on her back story and by extension Nadia's as well.
I don't see it as necessary for you to be considered primitive, but if you don't want a particular weapon proficiency BW and I have agreed in the past to replace it with a skill training instead. You're definitely want to keep your proficiency in simple weapons as unarmed combat is covered in that category if you go that route.

Eh... it's more like the show runs me. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
Sorry for the waiting guys, I haven't forgotten. I've had to make some diet/lifestyle changes because of some bloodwork I had done last week and I've been tired a lot. I think we'll have Grimm start in his own thread, just for ease of viewing, but then hook up with *Vendetta* somehow. I'll be introducing Modo in the next post most likely and then we'll all be in play, albeit in separate locations. I'll write out a way that the two ships meet up and then, depending on what has transpired, go from there.
As an aside for DSB, I don't usually plan out details of my games too much. Part of what I enjoy about GMing is the challenge of responding to creative player choices that I hadn't anticipated. As such, I have at least three different possibilities for how things could go for the two of you by the time the in-game forty-eight hours is up but I'd rather see what you come up with. I always thought that's what every GM did but I learned we all have different styles. Mine tends to be more sandbox-y, which, like all the other styles, has strengths and weaknesses. I can't promise anything but I'll try to get a post up on Friday night/Saturday morning if not sooner for both of you.
Now I need to think up a proper computer-ish title for Grimm's thread... <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

DSB - Alicia offered to jump in and GM your thread which I thought rocked, so I hope you don't mind. I'd offer advice if I thought it would help... <!-- s8/ -->![8/](https://i.ibb.co/kVxpy8vX/icon-eek.gif)<!-- s8/ -->

All set DSB. It's freeform so don't expect this sort of thing often (the rolling bit) but I thought about a couple scenarios and this seems the most likely. Post at your leisure. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

DB, rolls aren't set to work in all forums, like this one. Guess I could enable it, just never anticipated needing it here. dice will work in the game thread, however.

I've had two notifications of a post in this thread that turned out to be nothing... is everything okay?

### **Alicia** (2013-04-14 13:45:12)

I know at least one post has been deleted from this thread.

Sorry I was trying out the dice roller, still don't know what I'm doing wrong.

You're not doing anything wrong other than trying it in the wrong thread. Permission for rolling is forum based. Try rolling in the actual game thread.

Thanks Alicia, that makes me feel kinda stupid, prolly cos I was being stupid

Happens to the best of us.
There's only a few forums which don't actually have the permissions set to enable dice rolls and this apparently is one of them.
Suppose I *could* change it.
BW and I have been conspiring through PMs on the trouble Grimm could be getting into. Stay tuned.

Hey guys, bear with me my usual posting times (Friday/Saturday) are mostly going to be working overtime and traveling to New York to visit family. I'll do what I can when I can though.

### **Alicia** (2013-04-25 11:32:45)

Have fun! Though the overtime sounds dismal.

Meh. It was training really, and then a regular shift. It's been a while since I did a twelve-hour day though. I stayed home to do some housework but your posts are up. Lemme know if you've got any questions and I'll try to answer in a timely fashion. Cheers!

### **BWS2K** (2013-05-04 08:20:10)

Hey guys - I haven't forgotten about you, just been busy with life lately. No guarantees but I might have a couple hours tonight to get a round up. Thanks!

I'm in VA right now. Playing tourist has been pretty exhausting.
