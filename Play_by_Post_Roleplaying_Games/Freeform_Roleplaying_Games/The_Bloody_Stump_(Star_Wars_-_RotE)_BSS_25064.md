-The Bloody Stump is a house of literacy. Any good player knows that it's not necessarily quantity, but quality that makes fun RP. That means no asterisks, chat speak, or any other form of ugly expression. Use your words and you will be welcomed warmly.
-Do *not* post profiles. If you stick around long enough, I'll put something on the front page or if you like, send me a PM and you will be added to the list.
-Keep OoC to a minimum. If at all possible, take it to the [OoC thread](http://www.galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=174&t=25065 "http://www.galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=174&t=25065"), thank you.
-I am no stranger to trouble or rabble rousers. A good fight is always bound to happen, just take it outside.<div style="text-align: center;">

**Regarding the Cantina**
~&mdash;~
</div>

-Keep your kids under watch. There are too many sharp, pointy, poisonous, and adulterous things about to let youngins' run about willy nilly. Put 'em on a leash if you have to.
-If you and a partner want to rub up on each other, take it up into one of the rooms. Nobody wants to see that.

Old and rusted metal made rough from the colorful citizens of Coronet make the stalwart walls of Bloody Stump. Perfectly at home in the middle of the Corellia's Wild Sector, the multi-tiered building sits square on the end of Blue Sky Boulevard. The main doors open from the southern corner, a stout pair of heavy doors swing into an entry room.
Once inside, the soft decor lulls tired ramblers into a relaxed trance. Be it the transpara-steel, the soffit lighting, or the entrancing smell of freshly wiped up cleaning compounds, the atmosphere greets both rowdy and exhausted with comfort. The small mudroom gives guests a place to knock the mud from their boots and remove their coats. From the vestibule, exquisite blue and yellow panelled doors open into the bar. Elaborate chairs and tables are scattered about, set in no particular pattern as a row of booths run along the far wall, and opposite the room of them is the bar. The shiny counter is spotless, even the delicate grooves of the bar's top are surprisingly clean. At the end of the booth row an always open pair of doors lead into the lounge. Classical high back chairs, lounging couches and even a wooden table center the room, their plush cushions a deep red. Opposite the entrance is a grand fireplace, always burning bright for the comfort of guests.
Just past the lounge doors is a staircase leading up to the second floor landing that wraps around and looks down to the cantina. It is split down the middle on the far side, parting into a hallway for more rooms. Each a different size and variety. The doors are numbered and are available to rent for any one who has either walked, quested, climbed, fought, or simply drank too much to get through the night.
On the far side of the hallway, a centered door houses a stairwell that leads strictly to the roof. Past the handfull of flights, the steps open into a rooftop garden. Covered in soft clover instead of laid tar, the vibrant green offers a welcome contrast to the browns and grays of the cityscape. A single set of table and chairs is set up in the middle and a matching bench rests under the boughs of a willow, casting it's shade across the entirety of the garden.
Behind the bar, a set of cellar doors swing open to the lower levels of the Stump. It is down here that Galak practices his less "legitimate" business affairs. Priding himself on illicit trading and smuggling goods past Republic forces, Galak offers his services and his ship for any odd job to any willing to pay the price. If you have an item that needs procurement or a body that needs disposing of, Galak's name is whispered in all the right circles as the proper, dependable scoundrel for the job. Inquire within...

'I'm telling you Galak,' the man tells the barkeep in morose tones while staring down into the dregs of his beer, 'that girl will be the death of me.'
Sitting at the right end of the bar in what has become his usual spot, the alabaster skinned near-human goes through a time honoured ritual known to all cantinas throughout the Galaxy: he is telling the guy behind the bar all about his troubles. Young, handsome, tall and muscular, dressed smartly and well-groomed, the man may not at first appear to be someone who has a lot of troubles in his life. Looks can be deceiving. Currently he is explaining about the latest antics of his ward.
'She's refusing to let me send her to school, can you believe that? And let me tell you she needs it, she's like a damned animal.'
Taking a deep swig which finishes his drink, the man known to the locals simply as "the Stranger" glances meaningfully along the bar to the taps with his fathomless obsidian eyes, indicating his readiness for another.
It is not that he has no name. He has never offered it and no one has ever asked. One night someone started jokingly calling him Stranger and it stuck, to the point that now he even responds to it. Not that it's necessarily a true moniker at this point, since he first came into the Bloody Stump over a lunar month ago and has been in semi-regularly since, showing no sign of moving on from Coronet in the near future.
The ward Stranger refers to, if his story is to be believed, is a girl he rescued from a primitive life in one of Coruscant's forgotten under-sectors. A girl that shows no sign of making the transition easy for either of them.
