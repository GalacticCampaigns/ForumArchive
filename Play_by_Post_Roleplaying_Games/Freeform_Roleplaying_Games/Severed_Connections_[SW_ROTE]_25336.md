<div style="text-align: center;">
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">It&amp;#39;s been nearly fifteen years since Marina Cloudspinner and Joran Nor narrowly escaped Imperial authorities on Corellia, eventually reaching the uncharted planet of Marina&amp;#39;s ancestors, Iruji. The Outer Rim was safe enough from the Empire for a while, but in time Palpatine&amp;#39;s New Order reached to even the farthest corners of the known universe. Rumors of an underground resistance spread from planet to planet, system to system, fueling anti-Imperial sentiment and landing many in the spice mines on Kessel for just making mention of a rebellion.
Nadia Cloudspinner, Marina&amp;#39;s teenage daughter on Iruji, grows restless with life in obscurity and longs to be a part of something bigger. Dangers abound even without Stormtroopers and Imperial agents at every turn, but this does little to stop her insatiable wanderlust&amp;#8230;</span>**

**It's been three months since I've left Iruji. Karn is still apprehensive about having deceived my mother concerning my whereabouts, at least he hasn't turned the ship around and taken me back. He's gotten over his anger over my stowing aboard, but there was no way he would have taken me with him without putting it past mom. I think he understands my need to get away for a bit, though I have no idea when I'm going to return. I just… Feel like there's something I need to be doing. Something I need to learn which I can't in the isolation of Iruji. I want to find out what happened to my father as well. There's a story there which not even mom seems to know.
Anywyays, Karn has me piloting his ship, which has been a nice change. Its definitely different from the transports the Rangers use, and I seem to have a knack for plotting astrogation routes into the computer. I think at the next port I might see what other ships are docked, and whether they need a good pilot. Karn will be heading back to Iruji soon and its not like I'll be able to avoid going back staying here. Best to just jump ship before if becomes an issue.**

The ship drops out of hyperspace just in time for Nadia to watch a beautiful cloud of cosmic dust and gas envelop them completely. The engines suddenly give a high-pitched whine and then fall silent. A glance at the displays reveals to Nadia that they are, in fact, adrift in the nebula with sensors going crazy and propulsion systems offline.
"**What in the world was *that!?***" Karn shouts over the comms...

"**Uh…**" The young girl starts trying to bring some life to the engines which insist on remaing offline for the time being. Unable to coax them to life she brings her attention to the sensors. **"Somethings wrong with the engines. We dropped out in a nebula,**" she responds. She hoped he wasn't going to have her try to fix them. While she'd picked up some tricks from her mother, Marina, the fixit stuff wasn't really her thing.
Flicking the metal chassis with a light ping, the red eye of the old, reprogrammed marksman droid lights up. "**Wake up, Beedee. There's work to be done.**"
The remote beeps excitedly as it lifts off from the dash where it had gone into standby mode. Nadia is only able to catch what the little remote says thanks to the earpiece communicator her mother had long ago installed into her droid assistant. <**B3 = Ready**> It swoops over the panel for a moment before coming to hover by her head. <**Master = orders?**>
"**Go check out the engines. We need to get moving again,**" she tells the little remote. Glad not for the first time she had managed to sequester the remote when she had left.

Karn Okin appears in the cabin, still pulling on his jacket and looking older and scruffier than usual.
"**Blasted navicomp, worth less than scrap. Lemme see here…**"
He slides into a seat next to Nadia and begins making adjustments and reading displays that are beyond the scope of her familiarity with the vessel. After mumbling for a few moments, he sits back and announces his findings: "**Yep. We're dead in the water. Hope you know your way 'round an engine 'cause that's where we're gonna be for awhile.**" Karn rises, grabs an emergency extinguisher, and leaves the cabin in a hurry.
Before Nadia can respond, B3 chirps in her earpiece: <**Engines = burning**>

“**But that’s droid’s work,**” Nadia complains to no avail to Karn’s back as he rushes with the extinguisher towards the engine compartment. Taking a moment to reset the sensors for any proximity reading, though she doubted it would of be of much use anyways with the nebula playing havoc with them.. If someone were to attack them in their state, there was probably very little they could do about it anyways. Rather reluctantly, she makes her way to the compartment. The sooner the engines were fixed the better off they’d be.
Catching up, she crosses her arms as she looks over the still smoking engines. “**Alright, Cap’n. Where would you like to start?**” Karn obviously knew the ship, more specifically the engines, better than she did.

"**Well,**" comes a voice from beneath a series of conduits on the bulkhead, "**Step one'd be to uncross those arms and grab a spare set of tools. Step two would be to find something that looks broke and fix it. Try and get your little pet to take a trip down the length of the corridor and look for anymore obvious damage too. I think it can be salvaged but it'll take time.**" Karn was never crazy about Nadia's presence onboard - now he's torn between regretting letting her help pilot and grateful for the extra pair of hands.<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

A very long hour passes, in which the ship continues to drift aimlessly through space while Karn and Nadia work hard at getting the engines up and running. The occasional sound of success, and failure, punctuate the otherwise eerie silence. B3 earns his keep by helping to spot damage in the more confined areas of the engine systems but progress is slow. Status lights suddenly flash green, indicating they've succeeded, only to cut out a moment later - along with all the lights in the ship.
"**Uh oh.**"
Karn switches a few connections with his handheld computer into the main panel and confirms the worst: "**Okay, we're on emergency power reserves… that's about six hours 'fore life support gives out.**" The words have a serious, matter-of-fact tone. There's not much left to be said, so he gets back to work.
<**Master = orders?**>

Close, but no cigar. There's a small flashlight in the toolkit, and I assume B3 has one mounted. You're welcome to try anything else that might work, or just keep rolling that **Mechanics** skill.

### **Alicia** (2013-03-10 15:44:01)

There’s a moment of elation when the indicators go green, but then the moment is quickly over as the lights suddenly go out. Hovering nearby with the newly lit glowrod from the toolkit, Nadia waits to hear Karn’s prognosis. It wasn’t what she wanted to hear. “**Six hours before we’re breathing old air? Shouldn’t we put out a distress call or something?**” She broaches the question as she looks over a power relay. Fingering one wire than another, she tries to figure out what she’s supposed to be doing.
As the little remote comes to hover near her, she doesn’t bother to glance over at it. “**Beedee, see if you can track down the problem. We need to get main power back on.**” The remote had been modified to be her mother’s assistant after all. It had more technical knowledge of anyone she knew except its creator.

"**A distress call in this junk?**" replies Karn from beneath a series of conduits, "**Anyone that'd hear us is probably in worse shape than we are but knock yourself out - after we get the engines back up.**"
Another hour goes by, during which which B3 chatters almost constantly - both instructing and aiding Nadia alternately. They fare better this time and power is successfully restored to the engines.
<**Engines = happy!**>
With sensors out, navigation is going to have to be manual though and any jump to lightspeed is going to more guesswork than anything. Karn moves almost instantly from one panel to another, switching his focus to life support without so much as a cheer. The nebula outside is a beautiful sight and its bright reds and blues filter the starlight through the portholes, giving a ghostly ambiance throughout the ship's interior.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

So we'll say the engines work now, but sensors continue to be wonky and a successful distress call will be a **Use Computer** check.

### **Alicia** (2013-03-10 16:57:04)

With power to engines restored, Nadia wipes off her hands on a rag in a vain attempt to get the grease off of it. "**I'm going to power up these engines,**" she says. Not waiting for permission. It was time they figured out where they were and that wasn't going to happen while the nebula *fubar*ed the sensors. Taking her seat in the pilot's seat she takes her time in starting up the engines. Last thing she wanted was to overload them after they'd spent the last two hours fixing them. Bringing up maneuvering thrusters, she turns the freighter in a likely direction and then gradually increases the power to impulse. Since she was going to have to manually control the ship slow seemed best.

The ship lurches slowly in the direction Nadia aims for - an opening in the gas and dust not too far from their current location. Fortunately, sensors seem to calm down once they're in the clear. Unfortunately, they pickup a signal coming from only a few hundred meters above them. It's an Imperial ship. A very large one. The comms chirp to notify that Nadia is being hailed.
"**You mean there's actually someone *else* out here too…?**" says Karn, hearing the chirp from the back.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

...but at least the engines are fixed!

### **Alicia** (2013-03-10 18:20:50)

"**Sithspit,**" Nadia mutters, using an old curse she might have picked up somewhere. "**And not just anyone, Cap'n. It's Imperial…**" Looking at the comm board she watches the indicator blink for a moment wondering if she should go ahead and answer it. Well... It wasn't her ship, but what the heck. Karn was busy for the moment and he probably would have told her to wait if he'd wanted to answer it himself. Using the most grown up sounding voice she can manage, she flips the comm on. "***This is the* Moment's Notice**," she responds sinply, leaving it in the other ship's court to identify itself and see what it wanted. While she was glad to see another ship, from what she grew up hearing about the Empire she wasn't sure she wanted their help. Course again, that was Karn's decision.

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-10 20:27:46)

The unmistakable voice of an Imperial officer replies over the comm channel: "**How kind of you to introduce yourself. This is Imperial Star Destroyer *Vendetta* and you are obviously lost. Please allow us to help.**"
The channel goes dead just as Nadia hears the distinct sound of a tractor beam locking onto the ship.
"**Who is blazes was *that* and why do I have the feelin' I already know the answer?**" demands a weary and angered Karn Okin from the hatch.

Karn is a pretty grumpy guy in general, so don't take it personal. ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

### **Alicia** (2013-03-10 21:03:06)

Putting her hands up in a defensive gesture. "**I told you… an Imperial ship. A Star Destroyer to be more accurate. They seem to be taking it upon themselves to 'help' us.**" The last bit she says with sarcasm, not believing that they might actually go out of their way to help a tramp freighter. She looks over the engine status for a moment, wondering if they could manage to break free of the tractor beam and make it back into the nebula in time. This idea is quickly nixed knowing that the newly fixed engines were fickle enough and they were probably no match for the Star Destroyer's weapons.
Crossing her arms over her chest, she swivels the chair to face Karn. "**Well Cap'n, should we get ready to have company?**"

---

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-10 22:00:40)

"**So you *didn't* stutter. Well that's just great. I don't know if we can survive their idea of 'help'.**"
In response to Nadia's question, Karn simply breathes a deep sigh: "**You make it sound like fun - believe me, it *won't* be. The bes' thing'd be to behave ourselves…**" he says grimly, reaching into his hip holster and checking the heavy blaster pistol's power pack before giving Nadia the first grin she's seen from him in a long time, "**…but there's always hopin'.**"
He throws a few switches on the pilot controls overhead and the ship's engines gently whine to a stop once more and the weapons systems are taken offline.
"**Seriously though - the two of us'r no match for all them. Be polite and they might let us go, if we don't have anythin' of interest. So don'be interestin'.**"
The *Moment's Notice* glides silently into the main hangar bay of the star destroyer before its forcefields are powered up against he vacuum of space once more. A voice can be heard from outside the main hatch: "**Crew of the *Moment's Notice*, you are requested to surrender your ship to inspection by Imperial authorities at once.**"

### **Alicia** (2013-03-10 22:15:43)

Returning the grisly, older captain's grin, she follows suit to check over her own blaster. It's then deep in one of her pockets she remembers her mother's lightsaber. Pulling it out she sticks it in the small toolkit attached to her utility belt. At least it might seem less interesting there. "**Right.. be uninteresting. I'll be so dull I'll put 'em to sleep,**" she quips following Karn to the off ramp. While the quip might not be humorous, Karn would know that's how she would try to deal with a stressful situation like this.
"**Maybe you should do the talking from here on….**" she remarks knowing her attempt at conversing with the Imperials might get them into even more trouble. As BD comes to hover by her head, she has an idea. "**Beedee, I want you to slip off the ship unnoticed and stay out of sight. We might need you if they decide not to let us go.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

This is I suppose when that Heuristics processor would come in handy. I had this thought this morning to add in a plan b.

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-15 23:42:22)

Karn presses the keycode to the main hatch and it slides open, extending the landing ramp at the same time. Hey holds his empty hands to his sides in answer to the squad of stormtroopers currently aiming their weapons at he and Nadia.
"**Did we do something wrong-**" begins Karn, cut short by the ensign already walking briskly up the ramp with a pair of the soldiers: "**Stand aside please.**"
The guards stop directly in front of Nadia and Karn while the officer turns and motions for an inspection crew to start their work. As they travel up the ramp, scanners already active, there's time to get a better view of *Vendetta*'s interior:
The hangar deck has been patched in more than a few areas and a couple panels seem to have been left permanently open, revealing the power lines and piping beneath. The bulkheads are no different - a mainenance team is in the process of repairing some electrical damage in one of the far corners, if the sparks and burn markings are any indication. No other ships can be seen from where Nadia stands, though it's possible some smaller vessels might simply be outside her view. The two troopers guarding them and the squad at the bottom of the ramp wear battle armor that looks in need of repairing as well - one even has a series of holes running across his chestpiece with the burn marks still there. The damage to the *ship* might be accounted to prolonged stay in the nebula but *that* certainly wasn't. The ensign's uniform was spotless however. He gives a quick glance at the inside of the ship before addressing Karn in an equally crisp and professional tone: "**Your vessel's transponder code doesn't match anything in the Imperial registration database. These things do still happen occasionally but you understand our reservations, I'm sure. As hard as it is to believe, the Empire is not without its enemies.**"
"**Really?**" replies Karn, "**Now that *is* hard to believe. Some folks just dunno when t'give up I suppose…**"
The ensign's eyes narrow slightly at the obvious sarcasm, but he remains calm. "**Indeed.**"
"**Sir? You may want to take a look at this…**"
A summons from the inspection team draws the officer away momentarily. He studies a datapad intently for a few seconds, looking back and forth between it and Nadia and Karn. A brief exchange occurs between him and the technician before he returns.
"**You have astrogation data for a planet not currently on our charts. Rest assured it will be transmitted to the Imperial records as soon as we make our next scheduled breach of the nebula. You will remain with us until that time.**"
The guards motion for the two to disembark - not that they have much choice. Karn and Nadia are escorted by the ensign and the entire squad of stormtroopers to a sparse but acceptably clean holding cell. The trip confirms what had been observed earlier - theirs was the only vessel in the main hangar and *Vendetta* seems to be in a constant state of repairs. Patchwork paneling, open displays, wayward wiring - the nebula certainly takes it's toll on the Imperial ship. The hatch closes behind them without a word from anyone. The room is empty and featureless except a number of shallow indentations in the wall opposite the hatch - presumably "bunks", though there's no bedding at all - and a fresher set in the wall to the right. So much for privacy.

Okay, hope that wasn't too much. Your move.

### **Alicia** (2013-03-16 11:37:51)

Once in the confines of the holding cell, Nadia slumps down into the crevasse of a bunk and allows herself to brood. “**So much for not having anything interestin,**” Nadia says sorely. Of all the things for them to find, it had to be the astrogation data. Up until now she had kept her mouth shut, letting Karn do the talking while she made observations.
The ship was under heavy disrepair and from the looks of the Troopers who either prided themselves in battle scared armor or had been in a confrontation lately. The clean officer was a stark contrast, probably so clean because he wanted to make a good impression to his higher ups or make an imposing impression. Her thoughts were all supposition of course, but it was better to practice it then to start freaking out.
“**Three millennia,**” she starts, but leaves the sentence hanging, who knew if the Imperials were listening to their captives. She felt it likely that Karn would know of what she spoke. *We have to do something. The ship can’t transmit the coordinates.* There was BD, who could hack into the mainframe and erase the record. The problem with that was if he was caught or something unexpected happened. The little droid was an exceptional assistant, but a free thinker it was not. Once unexpected event in her orders would throw the droid through a loop and risk its safety. Of course, just being on this ship was a safety risk.
It was perhaps fortunate the Imperials hadn’t bothered to take their equipment. She could always cut herself out using the lightsaber, but she didn’t exactly want to leave evidence if it wasn’t necessary. That left BD to attempt to let them out or some other form of foul play.
Looking up at Karn, a plan begins to form, but without putting it past the captain wasn’t sure how viable it was. Keeping up the pretense of brooding, she reaches out with the Force in an attempt to discern any surveillance equipment and maybe figure out how many Imperials were actually nearby. After all, information was key in any escape attempt.

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-16 16:59:19)

Karn keeps mostly to himself, as wary as Nadia about giving away too much information. He walks the perimeter of the small room before laying down on one of the bunks: "**Not much use in worrying - we've got nothin' t'hide and I'm sure they'd rather fry bigger fish anyhow…**" Of course it was a lie, Nadia knew he was just as concerned as she was about the Imperials learning about Iruji. Her attempt to locate any surveillance equipment in the cell comes up empty, though whether it's because it's too well hidden or because it's non-existant, she's not sure.
What Nadia *does* sense though, and something which is hard to believe at first, is how few lifeforms she's able to detect throughout the ship. Either it sports a hefty droid supplement - which is unlikely, given standard Imperial practices - or the *Vendetta* is running at near skeleton crew levels. A rough estimate would put a full complement at around two thousand, including security personnel and pilots - Nadia can sense less than half that, and there are several non-Humans aboard as well.<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

The inspection crew continues their sweep of *Moment's Notice*, careful to search for any smugglers' compartments or military-grade weaponry or modifications. They find none, and since a diminuitive droid remote on standby resting among the ship's spare parts warrants little attention, B3-D3 waits until they leave and then makes his way down through the landing struts and out into the hangar bay.
<**"…slip off the ship unnoticed…" = Success!**> he broadcasts to Nadia's earpiece, using her own voice to replay his orders, <**…and stay out of sight." = Pending…**>
The remote hovers low to the ground, searching for a good spot to hide. He finds one of the many open panels in the deck and decides to duck in - and, his curiousity getting the better of him, begins following the small maintenance passageway wherever it may lead.

### **Alicia** (2013-03-16 21:17:44)

Her mind distracted by the update from BeeDee. She was glad the little remote had managed to find its way off the *Moment’s Notice* without being detected. She had a feeling the droid was about to provide some interesting recon.
“**Fishy,**” Nadia says suddenly. Dropping all pretenses as her Force exploration finishes. By all appearances she had laid back into the bunk covering her eyes as if she were about to take a nap. Having not sensed any detection devices she decides to take the risk they were non existent. “**Karn…. Why would a Star Destroyer be about with less than half a crew? And not be making a high-tail back to be replenished**” She had an idea at the answer, but Karn was a more experience spaceman. Pair the state of the ship and the stormtroopers and some things weren’t adding up.

---

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-16 21:34:55)

Karn hears Nadia's question, pauses before replying, then decides answering wouldn't really matter if they were being spied on. He rolls to a sitting position and thinks it over a moment, then: "**I assume you're talking about a particular Star Destroyer that also seems to have a buncha missing pieces inside - I've been wonderin' the same thing. It could be that they're as lost as we are, but that friendly gentlemen seemed to indicate that this is a usual patrol. That bein' the case, ya hafta wonder why all the repair crews and such. My guess would be they're either lying to us, or they were waiting for someone here before returning - probably not *us*. Or, for whatever reason, it's acceptable losses. You know as well as I do what the nebula did to us, and that was after only a little while. It's gotta wreak *havoc* on a ship this size.**"
The logic is pretty straightforward, such as it is, but only one conclusion can be reached by Karn Okin:
"**Call it intuition, but somethin' tells me this ain't an ordinary Imperial rig.**"

---

### **Alicia** (2013-03-16 22:53:34)

Even though Karn can’t see it, the girl nods in agreement. “**Not ordinary at all…**” Nadia agrees. It was becoming increasingly difficult to just lay in the bunk waiting for something to happen. A part of her itches to draw out her lightsaber and carve a nice big hole in the wall to escape through. Escaping of course posed it’s own set of troubles.
Aside from needing to erase Iruji’s coordinates from the system, they would have to sabotage the tractor beam and hope they could get to their ship in one piece. Then they’d have to avoid the Star Destroyer’s turbolasers, which probably wouldn’t be too big a problem. More than likely the *Moment’s Notice* could hold out in the nebula at least up until their life support gave.
Heaving a sigh, Nadia covers her face to hide the fact she’s talking. She speaks quietly into her earpiece. “**Beedee, report? Where are you?**”

---

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-17 00:03:03)

<**B3 = out of sight // Orders?**>
Just as the transmission finishes, the hatch opens and protocol droid - an RA-7 model, with its distinctive insectoid appearance - steps through, followed by some smaller droids of assorted makes and models. They're carrying some bedding and refreshments and begin placing them about the cell casually while the protocol droid, in a very whiny machine voice, addresses Karn and Nadia:
"**Greetings, crew of the *Moment's Notice*. I am RA-5, Imperial protocol droid in charge of hospitality aboard Star Destrory *Vendetta*. My orders are to see to your comfort as much as possible until we leave the Sulu Nebulae in approximately forty-point-seven hours. Commander Chayse requests your presence in three hours for dinner in his private mess. You'll find appropriate attire there,**" he points to a pile of clothes placed on an empty bunk, "**…should you desire it.**"
He turns to a small MSE droid and a brief exchange in Binary ensues. The smaller droid wheels over to the fresher station and drops a privacy screen remotely. Should either Karn or Nadia wish to use it, discretion is assured - as much as can be expected under the circumstances.
"**Apologies, our last guests did not require the use of a fresher. I understand your ship currently occupies a spot in our main hangar. Be certain it will be carefully watched for you until such a time as you are able and allowed to leave. We also ask that you please not discharge your firearms while aboard this vessel.**"
The droids, having dropped off their cargo and performed their assigned duties, file out the hatch behind RA-5.
"**I shall return in three hours. Do you require anything further?**"

---

### **Alicia** (2013-03-17 16:02:14)

Nadia nearly jumps out of the bunk when the door to their cell opens. The girl had been concentrating on her earbud communicator and contemplating the droid's next set of orders. Standing up, she moves out of the droid workers' way letting them go about their task.
An eyebrow rises as she considers the 'hospitality' droid. As the last of the items is deposited, the privacy screen, she's nearly completely confused by the going ons. "**Oh… maybe some holovids or a deck of cards or something? Gets rather dull with nothing to do.**" Pausing for a moment she feigns contemplating the next thought. "**Though if your commander would let us back on our ship we would be happy to sleep in our own beds and keep ourselves entertained.**" She offers the last knowing full well the last bit of the request would not be happening any time soon.
Going over to the tray of food, she pops in a slice of the cut fruit. At least they were getting some of the good stuff, even if it was plain fare. Guess this Commander Chayse didn't want their appetite spoiled for dinner. Chayse... now where had she heard that name before? Sorting through the pile of clothes they'd been supplied with she takes out what was obviously meant for Karn. At least it would be nice to wash up and be in clean clothes.
Turning back to the droid she says, "**Getting to a proper shower would be nice.**" That was probably a more reasonable request then getting back to the ship.

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-18 17:03:27)

RA-5 considers Nadia's request for a moment before responding with finality: "**I'm afraid our supply of holovids is authorized access only. Perhaps you'll find this more suitable though…**" He motions to the wall next to the fresher and a panel lifts to reveal a full-size recessed shower. "**We have few guests but do try our *best* to anticipate their needs.**"
Karn lets out a snort at this but the droid ignores it.
"**I'll return in three hours.**" he bows slightly and leaves, the hatch closing and locking behind him. Clearly, the prospects of returning to their ship is nil.<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

The time passes slowly but without further interruption. Karn doesn't bother to change and mostly naps - or pretends to. RA-5 escorts the two to a small room several levels away from where the cells are located. It's very clean, in contrast to nearly everywhere else in the ship, and lavishly but simply decorated in comparison to the spartan "guestroom".
The lights are dimmed slightly, creating an ambience reminiscent of candlelight, and there are small bits of tapestry and abstract art running the lengths of the walls. The greel wood table in the center could easily seat eight but is only set for three - one spot at the head and one to either side. The food is arranged so as to be within reach but is currently covered to keep warm. Nadia and Karn are both seated and their drinks poured before the hatch at the opposite end of the rectangular room slides silently open to reveal an imposing Imperial figure in full regalia. He proceeds to his chair with as much pomp as the short distance will allow.
"**Greetings, friends, and please allow me to welcome you once more to my ship, *Vendetta*. I am, of course, Commander Byron Chayse - his majesty's Imperial representative to Sulu sector.**"
Chayse, a man not much older that Karn though with a more youthful appearance, raises his glass in toast to the Emperor. His eyes meet Nadia's and for a brief moment a look of recognition seems to cross his face. It vanishes just as quickly however, and he begins to help himself to some of the roast. Karn, having neither raised his glass nor made any move to eat at all, looks at Nadia with a single eyebrow raised.
RA-5 and his assistants begin to uncover the rest of the dishes and move the food onto everyone's plates in silent servitude.

Getting over her disappointment at not getting the opportunity to get another look around the ship, she settles in for the wait. At least the droid had given them something, if was to be believed. They had about 40 hours before they would be leaving the nebula and the coordinates for Iruji would be transmitted.
After looking over the clothing, particularly for anything nefarious, she shrugs and decides that they weren’t too bad. Unlike her counterpart, Nadia takes the time to get cleaned up especially after the menial and greasy labor of repairing the freighter. Lacking a comb, she had used her fingers to get the tangles out of her dark auburn hair. Lacking much else to do, she plays various games on the bracer computer and had been starting to doze when the protocol droid returned.
Following along in step with Karn, she again keeps a sharp eye on what’s going on around them as they move to the commander’s mess. Her first impression of the rooms was that this man had obviously done well for himself, or at least liked to give that impression.While simply decorated, she still managed to find the decor ostentatious.
She was glad they didn’t have to wait long as she takes her seat across from Karn at the table and RA-5 and the other droids see to their drinks. Showing up in full regalia, she’s struck once again at his show of power and is hardly impressed. Something clicks in her head as he introduces himself fully and she remembers where she had heard the name. Growing up, Nadia had pestered her mother into retelling the stories of her adventures. One of them had included how she and Joran had managed to escape from some planet right under this Imperial commander’s nose. The fact in fifteen years he had never been promoted past the rank of Commander didn’t escape the young girl’s notice.
As he looks at her, the flicker of recognition gives her a moment of worry and she decides to tread very carefully. Glancing over at Karn, she gives a slight shrug of one shoulder in response to his unspoken query. At first following in Karn’s lead, she keeps her hands in her lap. That was until the droids starting serving the delicious smelling food and the sudden growl of her stomach erased any semblance of self control. Having dealt with ship rations for the better part of three months, this was going to be the best meal she had since she left home, and likely the last one she’d have for awhile. Let Karn be self-righteous in his strike against the Imperials. However, she doesn’t break down and start conversing with the commander. Purposefully or not, he had divulged another piece of a puzzle; they are in the Suhr sector. *Where ever that is.* Taking the moments of silence for granted, she contemplates this bit of information.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

This whole meal is likely to be awkward.
I'll go ahead and try an untrained Know Physical Science check to see if she recognizes the Suhr system

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-20 21:48:19)

The meal continues in silence for several minutes with only the sounds of eating - mostly coming from the Commander. Eventually he sits back, wipes his hands and face, and chuckles.
"**Hungry enough to eat but defiant enough to refuse conversation, eh?**" he states, looking at Nadia. "**Understandable. I'm afraid not everyone agrees with Imperial policy but…**" he shrugs, not needing to point out the obvious. "**…here we are.**"
The droids begin to file out silently, leaving the three alone in the room. Perhaps a coincidence, or perhaps Chayse has this encounter more scripted than it appears.
"**I've been stationed here in the Sulu Nebulae for over a decade now, and I've had a lot of… interesting guests. I don't question his majesty's assignments you understand, but I can't help but wonder that I should have been put here when so many other, more *qualified* officers were in line. Do you believe in fate, captain?**"
"**No.**" replies Karn simply. His food lays on its plate, untouched.
"**Of course not! You've seen too many years, too many battles, to subscribe to such nonsense! Ah, I envy you, Karn Okin.**"
Karn's eyes narrow slightly at the use of his full name but Chayse continues his musings.
"**Oh yes, I know your name. You're well-known to the Empire, though you may not be flattered. We keep detailed records of everyone with such an… *adventurous* past as yourself. How far you've come from the days of a simple fisherman - on Naboo was it? Yes,**" he chuckles again, clearly enjoying himself with this theatrical display, "**We have detailed files, but I suspect one of my lieutenants will want to dialogue with you further about that shortly. You may not believe in fate but you may want to choose your alliances with a little more care.**"
Chayse turns his attention now from the venomous silence of Karn Okin to Nadia.
"**And I'm afraid I must confess we know almost nothing about you, my dear. Not yet anyway… though I've a few ideas of my own.**" His speech is interrupted by a small explosion in the distance and a subtle rocking of the ship. "**Apologies! This cursed nebula wreaks havoc on my lovely ship. Fortunately, I look forward to reassignment very soon.**"
Chayse's stare makes Nadia somewhat uncomfortable and his words clearly contain some hidden meaning, though it's uncertain exactly what that could be. The *Vendetta*, it would seem, is rife with secrets, not the least of which may be its eccentric commander.

### **Alicia** (2013-03-20 23:23:02)

Nadia shifts uncomfortably under the Imperial Commander’s scrutiny and definitely didn’t like where his veiled threats were leading in her mind. Her thoughts all led down to the exiled commander turning them in as a prize to the Empire, most likely after a thorough investigation. If Chayse was already guessing as to her relations then she’d have to tread lightly. She could only pretend to be ignorant of so much, and it would only take a trip to her homeworld for nearly anything he might ask her to be verified.
“**I’m less interestin’ then a dormouse,**” she says, her uneasiness under his gaze causing her to blurt the first thing that comes to mind.

---

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-25 23:55:05)

Chayse regards the girl with an intense stare that seems to last much longer than it really does before replying: "**Indeed? I think you're being modest, my dear…**"
His gaze lingers a moment longer and then, as if nothing sinister had transpired, the commander suddenly laughs and scoops the last few bites into his mouth.
"**Now I must apologize. Captain - if you'll just follow these gentlemen,**" Chayse says as a trio of stormtroopers enters from the hatch behind nearest Karn, "**I wasn't jesting when I mentioned my lieutenant wanting a few words, though I confess he might not put it quite that way…**"
It comes as no surprise to anyone in the room, but Karn stands slowly, seriously considering drawing his sidearm and taking his chances. There's nothing to be gained just yet, even if Nadia and he *are* able to take the soldiers and Chayse down though - and that's not exactly *guaranteed*. He nods to Nadia and follows the troopers through the hatch, which closes silently behind them.
"**As for you, my little *doormouse*, my droid will show you back to your quarters while I attend to business. We'll have another chance to talk again soon enough I'm sure…**"
Chayse stands and leaves the room, while RA-5 enters in through the hatch that Karn just left from.
"**If you'll just follow me, miss…**"

Ugh. So that's mah post, apologies for anything that seems funky - I'm just not kicking this virus or whatever it is. Rough night at work.

### **Alicia** (2013-03-28 22:05:05)

Glad for the moment the Commander’s sinister gaze was no longer focused on her. The relief turns to anguish as Karn is forced to go with the troopers. She’d heard stories from the traders over the last few months, and even in hushed tones from the Rangers concerning the Imperial’s treatment of prisoners. What Karn had done to earn their attention she didn’t know. She did know him as a kind person, even under his surliness, and she trusted him.
Seeing the flash of his contemplations to draw his blaster then, she would back him up without another thought. Instead she catches his eyes and can’t help but frown with worry as he’s lead away.
Brought back to her own situation with the Commande, she tries to look anywhere but at him. When he leaves the room, she can’t help but to utter a stifled sigh in relief. Mutely she follows the droid back the way they had come to the cell.

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-31 12:09:17)

RA-5 doesn't even attempt small talk on the way back to the cell, the futility of feigning hospitality - despite any good intentions on his part - is now abundantly clear. He simply leaves Nadia to pass the time in the cell alone. The fact that Karn wasn't disarmed speaks to Chayse's confidence in the security personnel aboard, spread thin as they may be, as much as Karn's unwillingness to draw his sidearm speaks to the veteran spacer's supreme self-control under pressure. Whatever else may be happening in the ship, things were not looking good for Nadia... or Iruji.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, wicked short post to transition Nadia back to the cell alone. Now might be a good time to take a nap and have a dream or contact B3 or do anything you like with relative privacy (attempt escape, etc.). I'm hoping to introduce my character in the next post or two. No rush. Happy Easter!

### **Alicia** (2013-03-31 22:54:35)

Nadia finds the silence fits her mood, though it has the unfortunate result of leaving everything to her imagination and little in the way of answers. Now back in her cell, she finds herself pacing. It isn’t too long before she nearly falls into the cot. Pulling one of the blankets over her head, she tries to focus into calming her tormented mind. Pulling herself together, she retrieves the earbud commlink and slips it on. In quiet tones she speaks into the comm, “**Report, Beedee…**” Wanting some good news, she hopes the little droid has found something that might be of use.

### **BWS2K** (2013-04-06 00:55:51)

An Imperial Star Destroyer vessel is a miniaturized world where more than a few soldiers and officers spend the majority of their lives. To a diminuitive droid with equal parts excessive curiosity and staunch loyalty like B3-D3, however, the endless ducts, shafts, and ventillation systems spread throughout the ship like capillaries encased in a hulking metal skin prove to be an irresistable adventure. The opportunity to explore the inner workings of such a massive work of technology could not be passed over lightly.
But even under the strict leadership of Commander Byron Chayse, it takes much more than the Empire's finest to keep things running smoothly aboard *Vendetta*. A virtual army of tiny automatons crawl among the ship's hidden systems like mechanical antibodies, constantly repairing the damage from the electrical storms that streak across the Sulu Nebulae. B3 navigates the crowded corridors deftly and easily avoids detection. Not that there was any serious threat of being reported by any of the droids he'd encountered thus far - most were equipped with remote processors and completely uninterested in anything beyond the narrow scope of their present task.
Nadia's query for a report breaks across his digital senses and brings him from out of his reverie to a more immediate recollection of cicumstances: Things were not going very well for his master.
<**…stay out of sight." = Success!**> he replies, again quoting Nadia's own instructions. He then begins a list of what he determines to be the most important data discovered thus far:
<**Imperial Ship = Big… Lots of damage…**>
B3 proceeds to list, in detail, the systems that he's seen and to what extent they appear to be damaged. He hasn't explored to whole ship but it's enough for Nadia to surmise the original impression that *Vendetta* wasn't faring well in the nebula was spot on. The report is quite technical and surprisingly complicated, even for someone who knows her way around a ship. Thankfully, B3 provides a comprehensive summary at the end in a monotonous Basic:
<**Summary = Effectiveness of ship *Vendetta* in its primary role (space-based warfare) is severely limited in almost every respect. Capture of ship *Moment's Notice* is most probably a coincidence, as much of the main sensor array is either offline or crippled. Communications are in a similar state. Several tractor beam stations and main weapons are disabled. Preliminary observations of internal computer network suggest a very low level of security. Conclusion = This vessel is lost, has deserted, or is in some other way not being supported by local Imperial resources and, without intervention, will be derelict in no more than twenty days if it continues to sustain damage at present rates.**>
B3 pauses for a moment, certain in Nadia's ability to reach her own, more useful conclusions based on his simple data.
<**Master = orders?**>

### **Alicia** (2013-04-06 14:35:58)

Nadia is silent for a long moment as she processes the implications of the little remote's report. One thing was clear however. Her little droid friend had one important task.
"Beedee, I want you to hack into their system and erase any mention of Iruji... Coordinates, name, everything. I don't want them able to locate it. While you're in there see too if you can unlock this cell door and find out where they've taken Karn." For a moment she hoped she wasn't overloading the little droid's processor with commands. "It's time we got out of here."
Though she had a list of things for the remote to accomplish in the system the most important thing was to get rid of all trace of Iruji. If he couldn't get her out, well, she did have a universal key.

### **BWS2K** (2013-04-06 21:00:05)

B3 chirps an affirmative tone into the earpiece and sets about his work. All in all, it wasn't terribly difficult. *Vendetta* wasn't exactly in prime condition to begin with, and locating recently-entered data was never too difficult - at least not for a hacker like Bee. All references to Iruji were deleted, per Marina's orders, then he placed a small blind spot in the ship's solar sensor program. Despite what might actually ever happen, *Vendetta* would never register Iruji's star. Ever. The likelihood that it would ever be tripped was remote but in the event that a hyperjump took them through the system, the calculations wouldn't try to avoid the presence of the solar body or any of the planets and would almost certainly spell instant disaster for all aboard.
Unlocking Nadia's cell door was easy but locating Karn was not. There were, in fact, no references to the name *Karn Okin* at all in the ship's database.
Bee reported his successes after a long hour had passed for Nadia, along with the part about Karn's name - she would know better what to make of that than he would anyway.

### **Alicia** (2013-04-14 21:34:12)

It’s with a start that Nadia wakes from the nap she had dozed into, woken by the droning translation of Beedee’s binary into basic from the earpiece. Pleased with the little remote’s results and emboldened by the seemingly easy possibility of escape it’s soon superseded by her confusion over the lack of information on Karn.
“**Beedee… are there any records of them taking in the Moment’s Notice? Maybe they have Karn registered under an alias.**” She was grasping at straws but she found it hard to believe that a man who seemed as meticulous as the commander wouldn’t have recorded their arrival in some manner.
The girl did know one thing: before she attempted to leave the cell she needed to know where she needed to go, and she wasn’t going anywhere without Karn. However, it’s hard for the girl not to move toward the door. Placing her ear to the door, she reaches out with her Force enhanced senses. It would foolhardy after all to walk out the door with guards watching the hallways nearby.

### **BWS2K** (2013-04-14 23:00:17)

B3 chirps that he's started the search as Nadia approaches the door.
The Force is strong with her, as it is with her mother, and Nadia has a surprisingly clear mental picture of the passageway outside: it's empty of any guards that she can tell, though it's almost certainly under surveillance of some sort. Suddenly, without any warning and quite against her will, Nadia finds herself in the middle of a meticulously detailed vision:
She floats free in space, some distance from *Vendetta* and with a clear view of the entire ship. It seems to have sustained significantly more damage than Nadia remembers seeing earlier, though she couldn't be certain. Another vessel has pulled alongside it and begun firing gigantic grappling hooks through its hull. It's smaller in size but there's very little return fire. Jets flare as dozens of troopers exit the second ship and start cutting into *Vendetta*'s side. Nadia's vision now shifts to include an array of various scenes of battle taking place throughout the Star Destroyer. The stormtroopers are clearly identifiable but the attackers are all blurred, as if obscured in the Force - or intentionally hidden from her. The small compliment of soldiers remaining onboard *Vendetta* are soon overwhelmed. Her view shifts once more, this time to include the whole of the Sulu Nebula, pulsing in silence almost like a living being. There's an overpowering sense of impending significance - as if something important on a *galactic scale* was about to occur... and then it's over.
Nadia is brought back to the present as B3 notifies her of his findings:
<**"…are there any records of them taking in the Moment’s Notice?" = Affirmative! // "Maybe they have Karn registered under an alias." = Possible // Files = Very encrypted…**> is his reply, accompanied with a suitably sorrowful whine at his inability to break the encryption. The timestamp indicates it's been a full three hours since she asked for the information.
*Vendetta* suddenly rocks with a series of distant, and then not-so-distant, loud noises... the unmistakeable sound of the ship taking fire. Nadia's skin crawls with the telltale signs of ion weapons.

### **Alicia** (2013-04-14 23:56:08)

Picking herself up from the awkward position she fell into as the vision took over Nadia leans against the wall and shakes her head, clearing it of the residual traces of the vision and bringing her back to the present. Never before had she experienced such a vivid vision as evident by the goosebumps prevalent on her skln. Most of the time they were faint impressions of what was to be; enough to keep her out of the most dire of situations.
The impressions left on her mind leave her chilled accentuated by the sounds of ion fire. *It’s happening already?* Closing her eyes, she quickly forms a plan of action. Whatever they had done with Karn, she wasn’t going to find him if she remained here. While she hadn’t liked finding herself an Imperial prisoner, she wasn’t sure who was now attacking the Vendetta. The old saying: *the enemy of my enemy is my friend*, but who was to say that would be the case here? Better to meet the assailants on her terms than on theirs.
Opening the door she peeks out into the hallway, already knowing that she would find the hallway empty. In light of the attack, she doubts the commander would pay much heed to an escaped prisoner. Starting down the hallway, she tries to best gauge where she needs to go.
“**You’ve done great, Beedee. I’m heading to the ship, come meet up with me.**” Loosening the blaster in her holster she keeps her hand on it ready to draw it in an instant. Moving out of the cell block, she looks around for a terminal where she could get a map to make it easier to reach her destination.

### **BWS2K** (2013-04-15 11:54:23)

The sounds of battle now echo throughout the ship as Nadia makes her way to the nearest terminal at the end of the cell block passageway. It's looks active but the ship rocks once more with what must have been another direct hit from the attacking ship and it erupts into a shower of sparks - as do most of the lights in the area. Emergency lighting takes over, for what it's worth. A volley of blaster fire comes from her right: a pair of stormtroopers are are running towards Nadia, weapons raised.
"**You there! Freeze!**"
Opposite the terminal, all the way back through the cell block, is a turbolift. She can hear the sounds of some of the other prisoners shouting and banging on their doors in the passage behind her in various languages.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, real quick: you're in low-light conditions thanks to the emergency lighting (some of it's damaged as well, naturally) and at a T-intersection. Behind you are the cells, where you came from, to your right and left are passages that curve out of view, wrapping behind the cell block. If we were using a map I'd say you're a full action run from the soldiers and it's three times that to get to the other end of the block behind you - where there would be a matching terminal, symmetrically-placed, but its's a lift. There's ten cells on either side, yours is number four on what would be your left should you choose to turn and run towards the lift - we'll call it a Run and a Move to get inside the open door. Picture lots of sparks shooting from the walls, lots of sounds of battle, some slow motion, etc. Any other questions, let me know.

A curse escapes her lips as the computer sparks around her and the power goes out on the level. Singed from the cascade of sparks talking around her she jumps as the blaster volley finds its mark next to her. *Great… Was going to happen eventually I suppose.* Turning slowly towards the two stormtroopers she raises her hands in the universal sign of surrender.
"**Hello, gents…**" she says saiting for them to get just a little closer. "**Wish we had time to chat, but I'd rather not stay.**" In a twist in the troopers' fate, she reaches out with the Force, latching onto the body of one of the troopers and hurling him towards his companion. With a wince as they fall into a pile nearby, she looks over their gear, reaching into the helmert of one to retrieve his com link. With their grenades, any code cylinders and keys in hand she makes for the turbo lift.
So far it seemed she would have to find her own way.

### **BWS2K** (2013-04-20 12:19:00)

The sensation of being under attack intensifies as the adrenaline courses through Nadia's body. Her sprint down the hallway only took a few seconds, during which dozens of shots and smaller explosions - likely grenades or explosives of some kind - echoed throughout the halls. As she nears the turbolift, however, the doors open to reveal none other than Commander Byron Chayse, escorted by a trio of Stormtroopers with rifles at the ready. Chayse raises his sidearm quickly and smiles.
"**You see? I told you we'd talk again soon. I just had to look through some older files… *Take her alive!***"
Nadia finds herself once more in the crosshairs of multiple weapons when, suddenly, B3 bursts through a ceiling vent beside her. It's a momentary distraction for the soldiers, who aren't sure what to make of the little droid, but Chayse shouts incoherently and begins shooting and they follow suit.

Nadia comes to a dead stop as the lift doors open and the ship’s commander with his escort aim their weapons at her. Taking a couple steps backwards she’s glad when the little remote pops out of the nearby vent.
“**This ain’t talkin…**” she calls over the din of their blaster fire. With quick reflexes she swipes the little remote out of the air and with it tucked under her arm makes a break for the empty cell. At least it would provide her some opportunity to escape the blaster fire not yet directed her way.
Her heavy breath concealed by the sounds of nearby explosions she can't help but to ask yelling down the corridor, “**Don’t ya have a ship to worry about, Commander?**”
Not waiting to hear what the commander has to say to that Nadia holds up the little remote to let it’s own antigrav unti take control. “**We need a way out… pronto.**”

### **BWS2K** (2013-04-21 19:40:54)

B3 lets out an excited whistle as Nadia bolts for the door and dodges the blaster fire with reflexes worthy of any Jedi. Any response to her taunting is drown out by the bustle of troopers in the passage. B3 responds to her concerns about escape:
<"**…a way out… pronto." = processing…**>
In his defense, the situation did seem rather dire.
Nadia begins to hear a change in the sounds outside the closed hatch though, indicating a firefight has broken out. The shooting seems to be coming from both ends of the hall, and a smattering of it strafes across her own wall leaving little dents along the length of the plating. Screams can be heard from the end of the passage where Chayse and his soldiers were.

It can’t be said the girl lacks curiosity as the direness of the situation seems to completely escape her in the intense moment and she pops the hatch open enough to take a look into the hallway. The screams from the Commander’s direction was the catalyst in the decision and since BD’s escape plan was at the moment lacking, the Star Destroyer’s commanding officer was blocking two known means of escape. The vent and the turbolift. The former looking the most promising for the time being since BD seemed to have a working knowledge of how to get around them.
“**Change of plans, little guy,**” she says grabbing the remote again with a free hand and putting it in a free pouch for that purpose. When the moment is right, she decides she’s going to make a run for the vent shaft.

A quick glance outside reveals a lot of charred paneling and a full-on firefight in progress. The soldiers by the lift have been joined by several others, though some are clearly injured and a few lay motionless. Chayse's absence is noted. To Nadia's right, advancing on the stormtroopers, is large droid of indeterminate make and model surrounding by a myriad of smaller ones - all attacking in whatever way possible. There's no time for a thorough inspection but these are definitely *not* Imperial droids. The modifications they sport, and the the tenacity with which they fight, indicate some serious tactics at use here. If all the attackers were droids like these, it might explain why their appearance was blurred in Nadia's vision.
As if to drive the point home, the larger droid fires a pair of missiles that scream past Nadia's head and hit home near the lift. The explosion rocks the deck and a loose panel crashes to the floor inside her cell. There's only a slight pause in the blaster fire before the soldiers that somehow managed to survive the volley begin firing out of the smoke once more. The vent lays open ahead and, dancing through the blaster bolts, rockets, and small arms fire like only a true Jedi could do, Nadia leaps up into relative safety above the fray.
<**"…a way out… pronto." = This way!**>
B3 emerges from his pouch to lead his master through the twisting shafts and duct-work.

### **Alicia** (2013-04-27 13:08:24)

Nadia scrambles into the vent shaft, glad to escape the immediate firing range of the unusual squad of droids. However, she doesn’t allow herself to stop. While she was out of immediate danger the fact that the ship was being overrun by droids and that Chayse was nowhere to be seen made it even more important to get out, and fast. There was the probably of how she was going to get off the Star Destroyer. Even heavily damaged, a Star Destroyer wasn’t something to trifle with, which mean that the ship that had attacked better equipped to deal with this part of space. Where did that leave the *Moment’s Notice*?
*I’ll cross that bridge when I get there.*
“**Beedee, do you know where these droids are boarding from?**” she asks in a hushed tone into her earbud, knowing the vent would likely echo anything she might say and give away her position within the shaft.

Unless you have another fleet of droids hiding somewhere, you’re using Capt Steel!
And what’s this about Dex checks? Acrobatics work?
Don’t have either, but at least one would use the half level bonus. Here’s a few rolls
**Acrobatics** +5
***21*** <- [16] 1d20 + 5
***13*** <- [8] 1d20 + 5
***11*** <- [6] 1d20 + 5

<**Droid entrance points = lots of hull breaches // vents = all clear… probably…**>
Beedee is significantly smaller in size than Nadia and they couldn't exactly follow his path directly back to *Moment's Notice* without a few detours. There were several close calls when stray blaster fire perforated the thin paneling just as the pair had passed through a section but it was mostly safe travels. The Imperials were putting up a valiant fight - if they had been at full strength instead of running with such a low compliment they may even have prevailed. As it was, however, their pockets of resistance were crumbling fast. Views from vents and open hatches along the way told Nadia that much at least.
Minutes seemed to pass like hours but eventually they arrived at the main hangar bay, beneath its patchwork deck. Opposite them lay *Moment's Notice*, a very exposed jog away. Another ship, larger than Karn's, suddenly pulled into the bay. It had a spotless chrome finish with orange and gold trim. A giant gold cog painted on its side was the only identifying marks. There was no way this was the vessel that had attacked - it was most likely a shuttle of some sort. Droids began entering the bay from all the adjoining passageways, some escorting stormtroopers with hands above their heads. It wasn't like the Empire to surrender for any reason but nothing about *Vendetta* - or Commander Chayse for that matter - was typical.
"**Crew of Imperial Star-Destroyer *Vendetta*: lay down your weapons and surrender,**" came a mechanical voice over the ship's all-comm system, "**…or perish.**"

So if you want to go somewhere else that's fine, you're still in the passages and hidden. It's impossible for me to type this the way it's looked in my head since we began. This scene, more than anything else that has happened for three pages, has been my goal. Enjoy!

Not out of the woods yet, so to speak, Nadia looks over the tableau in the hanger bay. Biting her lip she considers her few options. With the arrival of the new ship it was doubtful she’d be using the *Moment’s Notice* to be making her escape. Of course, she could always try and appeal to the captain of whoever was in charge of the operation. Maybe he would agree, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. It was also just as likely the captain would throw her in with the other Imperials and she’d be met with the same fate.
Watching as the captured stormtroopers were escorted toward the newly arrived ship, she makes her decision. “**Come on, Beedee. Let’s see if we can’t make ourselves some friends?**” Motioning him back into the pouch out of sight, she cautiously hauls herself out from the narrow vent, glad to at last find herself out of the tight space. Moving slowly as she exposes herself, she holds her hands out to show she didn’t have any intention of drawing the blaster at her hip.
“**I wish to speak to your captain,**” she declares loudly.

A number of the closest droids turn to watch Nadia emerge from hiding but few seem interested in her and continue about their business of assembling the Imperial captives into a circle off to one side of the hangar. One though, a protocol droid by the looks of her very feminine features, approaches calmly. She wears a simple sidearm holstered at the hip and is mostly a matte black finish with dark pink highlights.
"**You'll have your chance to meet with the Captain soon enough, youngling. For now, please wait with the others…**"
The droid motions to another crowd being corraled into a clear area - the other prisoners, no doubt. Some are being attended by white medical droids, others appear to be unconscious and are being carried gently and set up on stretchers. Among the awake and alert is Karn. He spots Nadia and shrugs his shoulders, as confused as anyone else about the current situation.
Suddenly breaking through the din is the very loud and agitated Commander Byron Chayse: "**I am an Imperial officer and this is *my* ship! I *demand* to know who is responsible for this!**" He enters from the main bay doors escorted by squad of the mis-matched droids, including one of the larger ones that Nadia remembers firing missiles. His uniform is dirty and torn in places but he walks with his usual pomp nonetheless. The rant continues as he marches unimpeded right up to the bottom of the ramp extended from the newly-arrived ship. Commander Chayse is not one to be ignored - even if it means making an embarassing show of Imperial ignorance and pride.
It's quite a sight to see but it all happens at a fairly quick pace. The droid army, those not guarding the stormtroopers or attending the wounded prisoners, assemble in ranks a short distance from the bottom of the ramp to the left. To the right is a smaller number of them formed in a single squad. Nadia notes the droid that spoke to her wore a small gold cog over her breast, as do all the rest with the exception of the half dozen gathered together to the right of the ramp. Some things are the same no matter where you are in the galaxy - these are most likely "new" recruits. The term seems dubious since droids are manufactured and not born, but that's clearly the intent of this ceremonial arrangement.
The shuttle's doors open slowly, revealing only darkness within. The sound of someone walking - no, more like marching - grows and grows until a figure appears at the top of the ramp. At first glance one might mistake it for a human, or at least a humanoid, given the posture and clothing worn - a long dark blue coat, unbuttoned at the front, an ancient black triangular hat with gold trim, and large brown boots. An archaic sword hangs around the leather belt at its waist, almost certainly ornamental rather than functional, mirrored by an over-sized pistol tucked into the other side. He pauses a moment to survey the scene and continues stomping down the ramp.
"***What's going on here?!* Do you mean to tell me-**"
Chayse's scathing remarks are cut short as the droid reaches the bottom of the ramp and calmly, deliberately, punches him square in the jaw. His body falls to the floor in a rather unflattering manner. The droid then turns to the right, answering the salutes of those there, and proceeds towards the smaller squad on his left. The female droid then approaches and salutes solemnly.
"**Captain Steel, sir, the ship is ours.**"
The Captain nods in acknowledgement and reaches deep into one of his big pockets, withdrawing a handful of little golden cog emblems. The pair then proceed down the line, "pinning" one on each of the droids. Despite its size and the presence of all manner of battle damage, wounded soldiers, and half-broken ship systems the hangar seems somehow still and quiet for the duration of the ceremony, odd though it may appear to some. Once the last droid is decorated, however, Captain Steel turns to face everyone else and, very unexpectedly, draws his sizeable blaster from its place and fires several very loud blasts into the air:
"***The ship's ours, lads!***"
What follows is best described as a cacophony of vocabulators and rattling appendages indiscernible to all present.

Whew. I think that's good for now. You're in the crowd with Karn and the other non-Imperials. I'm out of breath over here...

Nadia tried not to be galled from being called ‘youngling’, and she quickly forgave the droid its error upon spotting Karn. Happy to make her way over to the group of released prisoners, she surprises herself by giving the gruff captain a hug in relief.
Speaking quickly, she rambles almost incoherently relating everything that had happened since they separated. “**And when Beedee couldn’t even find a record of you in the computer I was even more confused.**” She pauses allowing herself to take a breath. “**It was very weird, but I’m glad you’re here now. Are you alright?**”
Anything Karn might have to say is interrupted by Commander Chayse’s entrance into the bay. Who could miss his outraged debacle? The seriousness of the situation prevents Nadia from being amused by the sudden turn of the tables, but as the droid captain decks the arrogant commander of the now captured Star Destroyer Nadia feels a tingle of perverse satisfaction.
It’s replaced by curiosity as the droid crew performs their ritual. The whole crew was a curiosity consisting entirely of droids. She’d never heard of such a thing. At least not since the Clone Wars when the Separatists had ships full of droids. She tried not to seem too curious as she turns her attention to helping the freed prisoners. Or at least she hoped they all would soon be freed.
Voicing the thought, she quietly asks Karn, “**Do you think they’ll let us go?**”

"**Well, they probably won't punch us in the face at any rate. I suppose we'll have to wait and see. Could be pirates with no love for the Empire - they might just leave us to ourselves…**"
His neglect in addressing his absence in the Imperial database can hardly go unnoticed but the droids begin to disperse once more throughout the ship. Their mission isn't immediately clear. Their leader, Captain Steel, motions to the black and pink protocol droid who begins to speak to the gathered prisoners:
"**Attention former Imperial prisoners - you are now free. The future is yours, as this vessel will be, as soon as we finish our operations. Those who serve the Empire will be *escorted* to the remaining holding cells to await your judgement. Any who wish to enlist and serve aboard the *Clockwork Pheonix*,**" at this she looks at the newly-freed droids in the crowd,"**…are welcome to do so momentarily.**"
Another droid, displaying his golden cog emblem proudly, rolls forward to accept and process new recruits. The protocol droid turns away with a short bow and sets off to follow the Captain out of the hangar.
Chayse is still unconscious at the foot of the ramp, apparently not worth the effort to move.

So that's a good place to stop I think. At least you have some closure and a couple options about how Nadia proceeds. She could go with Steel's crew, or fly around in her own Star Destroyer, or get out of there with B3 - whatever she likes. Sorry for the long wait. ![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)
