The Mandalorian Wars are over leaving the Republic in apparent ruins. With their greatest champion, Revan, gone with his apprentice and their followers the Jedi are left to bolster the Republic. A year passes and all believe that Revan has died, abandoning the Republic for some idealistic crusade in the Unknown Regions. Rumors are spreading, however, that Revan has returned with a massive fleet. For what purpose is yet to be determined.

"Just when we all thought the war was over, another attack. The republic is doomed." A man seemed drunk, falling across the table he talked to a soldier sitting across from him.
The soldier sighed. "Times are bad." He nodded in agreement with the drunk.
"To think Revan would turn against us... against him, what chance do we have?"
"Revan?" The soldier exclaimed. "I think you've had a bit too much to drink." He grabbed his friend, pulling him from the table. "Come on, time to head home." He quickly tried to move the man out the door.
Zeisan sighed, watching the scene from a distance. Finding a quiet place to get a drink was becoming harder and harder. He set down a credit chip and put his helmet back on as he stood up from his seat and casually strolled out of the cantina. He began moving towards the space port, watching for strangers. When he arrived he would keep an eye out for new arrivals. He had been in Anchorhead more than once, and knew the locals and knew most of them were just trying to get by in life. Travelers came through every day, but things never changed. As he walked around he glanced at the shops. They sometimes had things that caught his eyes, but not today. The large pistol strapped to the right thigh of his armor kept most people from bothering him, after all he was here to do a job, not start petty little fights.
Zeisan was just over two meters tall had bright green eyes and black, messy, hair. All of which was covered by this armor. His gun metal Krail 210 armor had seen better days and from the looks of no one could if it was black when he bought it or he had just been shot at, blown up, or other wise had some one trying to hurt him so many times that the original color was faded. His heavy blaster rifle was back on the ship and for good reason. The rifle seemed to get him into more fights in Anchorhead rather than detour them.
As he walked into the port he headed to dock eight. The door opened with a quite hiss followed by another sigh from himself. The Dynamic-class freighter had seen better days, what day that was was something Zeisan was still trying to figure out. The hull plating was barely held on thanks to his welding skills and the paint was all but gone. Only the area around the cockpit still had the original silver and blue paint job, other places still had some of the paint but they were hard to find. Still despite all the Zeisan felt that the ship had more character because of it and that character is part of the reason he enjoyed working on the *Reluctant Angel*. As he walked up the landing ramp he heard a droids voice complaining about a repair Zeisan had done earlier. With a deep breath he followed the voice and found Crash, a 3DO Protocol droid that had a bad temper and had no issues sharing it with others, looking at a power cuppling and trying to understand how the ship was still working "Crash how many time have I told you. I just do what is needed. You know most of the time we don't have the money for the parts we need so just leave it be till we get some more money ok." he said walking away from the droid before he had a chance to say anything.

### **Alicia** (2010-01-01 21:46:48)

Jace popped her head out from the crawl space she was working in. Her face was lined with grease and dark strands of it stood out against her light blonde hair. "You should know better than to take what Crash has to say to heart, Zei." Her head popped back into the space and then a few moments later she climbed out of the duct. "Well... did you find us a client?" Her mind slipped back to the list of parts they needed. The Angel always seemed to need something. Soon they would have to replace the hull plating, but that was going to cost... Big. And she wasn't so sure if she could count on the generosity of an acquittance of her late father to get it done.
That meant they needed a job. Cargo would be preferable, but there was only so much cargo her ship could hold. Passengers would work too, but she was always loath to bring new people onto her ship. It tended to make things complicated.
Jace turned to look toward the ramp, her face taking on a look of deep concentration. "We have company," she stated calmly.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-02 14:08:00)

'Hello there,' a voice called from outside in the hangar, 'I've got the parts you ordered! I'll wait at the bottom of the ramp.'
Whoever was out there shouted loud enough to be heard clearly, and their voice might be recognised as that of the young assistant mechanic at the workshop where said parts had been ordered that very morning.

---

### **Vash** (2010-01-02 23:27:02)

Zeisan sighed as he set his helmet down "Guess I should leave it so I don't scare off the help." As he walked back to the cargo hold he ignored Crash's remark and resisted the urge to pull out one of his adhesive grenades so he could stick Crash to the outer hull of the ship and let out a small snicker as he thought that Jace might pick up on the thought. As he walked down the ramp the sound of his boots were slightly different. It sounded as if his left boot was heavier.
Zeisan looked the man up and down "Hi there. I'm the guy you talked to this morning, guess you get to put a face to the voice behind the helmet now. Come on up and ignore the droid as best you can." he turned and walked up the ramp "Jace the parts are here!!! You want me to lock up Crash?!?!" he yelled jokingly

---

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-02 23:55:09)

'Yes sir,' the man said with a smile.
He guided the repulsor sled carrying the components up the ramp and looked around the *Angel* with apparent interest, his hazel eyes taking in all of the jury-rigged repairs.
'She's seen better days,' Trae remarked as he parked the sled at the end of its short journey, 'but I bet she could tell some stories if only she knew how.'
Taking from atop the small pile of boxes a datapad, he flicked through the menus to find the receipt.
'If you could just confirm that everything you ordered is present and correct we can finalise the transfer.'
He scanned the list himself before handing over the pad.
'Mostly minor parts and replacement components for internal systems I notice,' he commented, looking around once more at the ship's battle scars, 'are you certain the key systems don't need any work while you're here?'

---

### **Alicia** (2010-01-03 00:11:28)

Jace emerged into the cargo hold, wiping her hands on an already dirty rag. At one point she had rubbed her hand across her forehead, a smear evident in all its greasy glory. Obviously having been working in the dredges of the ship, her green shirt is smudged. The only part of her which apparently doesn't seem to be dirty are her black trousers and even then its doubtful even they escaped unscathed. She glared at Zeisan for a long moment, having picked up on his earlier plan. "Crash is busy, so no need." Deeper in the ship the mechanical burr of the droid could be hear indistinctly as it began its most recent tirade. She turned her attention to their guest. "I'm Jace Cloudspinner, captain of this vessel." She looked over at Zei and then back at the stranger.
Jace looked around fondly as she spoke. "She certainly would have some stories." Allowing Zeisan to handle the part list she answered the question. "Major systems are fine, its the little things which always seem to break down. Probably would be best to just get her overhauled. Not that we can afford that at the moment." She muttered the last part.

'Ah, well, I completely understand money worries,' Trae replied in serious tones yet while wearing an amused expression, 'but I have to ask, you know. Boss expects me to try and make a hard sell.'
He stepped forward and offered his hand in the traditional greeting of humans and many other species beside.
'I'm Trae, and while I cannot offer a title as lofty as Captain, I can truthfully declare myself the current assistant mechanic at Borgen's Repairs ("Speed! Sense! Style!"), a subsidiary of Borgen's Parts Emporium ("Grab 'em while we have 'em!"), which is itself a subsidiary of Borgen Enterprises (a Galactic Trading Concern). And its my pleasure to meet you.'
Trae smiled ruefully and ran his left hand over his hair in a mild case of embarrassment.
'I apologise for the lengthy company endorsement, but I'm contractually obliged to say it,' he explained, 'though its ridiculous really since the whole "Galactic Trading Concern" is run from the one shop. I should have read the fine print before taking this job you know, there are some very peculiar clauses in there.'

### **Vash** (2010-01-04 21:35:19)

Zeisan looked at Jace as she glared at him "What?" he asked as if he had done anything wrong. As Trea gave his introduction Zeisan looked at him with one eyebrow raised "Well there could be worse things in life. Like trying to work with a droid that only know how to insult you, even after you repair him. Ok so I accidental crossed some wire and he couldn't talk for two days, but I never said I was an ace mechanic. Just a jack of trades, master of none." Zeisan looked at the parts list and cracked a small smile "Yeah I see you brought some extra parts to try and sell. Sorry but we don't have the credits. After this, and paying for the resupply, we won't ever have enough to repair my arm here." As he set the list down he held up his left arm, which had too many scratches, carbon burns, and other small dents in it to count. There were just as many small "patches" were work had been do to put off getting the arm replaced.
Zeisan lowered his arm and picked up the parts list once more and double checked it "You know Jace I might be able to pull on a few of my last strings here if you really wanted to buy some of these parts." He said turning to face Jace again "Or we could Hire Trea here to give us a hand replacing all the parts" he turned to face Trea "That is of course if we can hire you?" he before looking away for a second "Oh I forgot to give you my name" he turned back around "I'm comman--- I'm Zeisan Sumisu nice to meet you."

---

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-04 22:00:33)

Trae betrayed no reaction at Zeisan's near slip, but he thought perhaps he wasn't the only one present with a past best avoided.
'I'm only working for Borgen on a freelance basis, so I'm open to other offers,' he confirmed, 'although I wouldn't be if I'd let him get away with the first draft of the contract. I might have missed a few weird clauses, but I know better than to sign myself into slavery.'
'And speaking of parts,' he added, glancing down at Zeisan's mechanical limb, 'that arm looks worse off than the ship. I'm sure I could neaten it up if I could study the original schematic. Boss probably has a copy somewhere. Do you know the model number?'

---

### **Alicia** (2010-01-05 21:35:58)

Jace held out her hand to take a look at the supply list, and then resisted the urge to sigh heavily as she calculate what was left of their dwindling funds after this. She absently looked around the cargo bay. There were things of worth she could use to barter, most of them not worth much on this dust ball unless she found the right sort of person who wanted them. "Maybe we should discuss such options later, Zei." She knew using his last contacts might end up causing them more grief than solving. Those options were best left as last resorts. And she certaintly didn't want to talk about them when there was a stranger on board.
Turning her attention back to the list of parts she marked off the ones they definitly needed and had ordered (power couplings, check. power conduits, check. replacement plating, check.), anything other than she would have to arrange barter for. "I'm afraid with this list I wouldn't be able to pay for your work in credits. If you would accept payment in goods, then we could definitely come to an arrangement."

---

### **Vash** (2010-01-05 22:14:16)

Zeisan nodded and was about to see what Trea response was. Then he asked about his arm and what the model number was. Zeisan turned and looked at Jace trying to hide his fading color for the new Trea. "Um...model....model number...um." He took a large gulp of air and tried to regain his composer. He had never fully replaced his arm and it was it's still mostly is original design. He pulled his left arm up to his chest and rubbed his temples with his metal hand. He had no idea what to tell him. If told him the truth and that his arm was original and still at least eighty percent beskar then he would know that he played a major roll in the Mandalorian war and more importantly that he was once a Mandalorian. No one ever liked him much, in fact most hated him after they found out about his past. Jace, whom he now saw like a little sister, even hated him for a time until she learned the rest of his story.
Zeisan took a deep breath and tried again to calm down as he held his left elbow in his right hand "You know...that's ok...um...I think it will hold out for a good deal longer. Besides this was a custom job so there's no model number." he said knowing that the part with the model number on it had already been replaced. It was the first thing he did when he got out.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-05 22:24:12)

'Well, if you're sure,' Trae responded, apparently not noticing Zeisan's nervous behaviour (or simply smart enough not to react to it), 'though even without the model's schematics I could have a look and see what I can do.'
The young mechanic's attention soon turned to Jace, and he listened to her offer of barter.
'Well that would depend on what the goods were I suppose,' he said, unwilling to be pinned down to such an agreement without fully understanding the terms involved. Borgen hadn't found him so easy, and neither would anyone else!

---

### **Alicia** (2010-01-06 00:57:16)

Jace looked back at Zei as his emotions conflicted concerning his arm. His mental turmoil almost made her wince as she shared it. She knew how much it pained him to have his past thrust back onto him and to be hated for it. It came to mind that she would find some way to get his arm fixed, though she doubted the same materials would be the same.
Turning her attention away from Zei and Trae she walked toward the workbench and took out the datapad she kept her cargo manifest listed. Handing it to Trae she decided she'd let him name his price. "This is what we have to offer. It's not much." It didn't take much for her to realize he was going to be a hard bargainer. With any luck she would soon have an extra pair of hands to get some of the multitude of tasks completed on the ship.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-06 07:31:11)

Taking the manifest, Trae scanned it quickly with an experienced and discerning eye. When he reached the bottom of the list a small smile twitched its way onto his lips.
*This*, he thought, *should be easy.*
The mechanic shook his head and handed back the datapad to Jace.
'Not much there that interests me. But... well, perhaps we can come to an arrangement in any case. What do you say to four bottles of the Savareen brandy and a free ride off planet? If I'm going to help fix the bird I might as well see how she runs and celebrate a job well done.'

---

### **Alicia** (2010-01-06 10:31:53)

Jace taking the datapad back almost winced as he named his price. *I should have suspected as much. No one with an ounce of wanderlust would stay on Tattooine for long.*
"Where exactly is it you were intending on heading?" *What am I getting us into*, she wondered. Now it was her turn to look at Zeisan, her apprehension hidden by the calm demeanor she had learned to exude. The only evidence was a slight shifting from one foot to another as the thoughts filtered through.
The brandy she knew they could live without. It was left over from when her father had been captain, hidden away in one of his many places. That reason alone had been why it had survived on this ship until she had come along. Frankly she had been surprised the enterprising Republic crew hadn't found it when they had custody over the Angel. It had after all only taken her moments to find the hidden cache.

---

### **Vash** (2010-01-06 13:55:48)

Zeisan glanced over at Jace. He closed his eyes and focused on here and now. He knew Jace would be catching some of what was going through his mind. It was something that he learned early on about her and so he learned to control his emotions as best he could, he still had some way to go. He opened his eyes and once again pushed his past and his own problems to the dark corners of his mind. He would work out his own past someday but now was not the time.
He finely turned around while he ran his metal fingers along his jaw line and looked down at the floor thinking "I'm not sure...four bottles of Savareen Brandy *and* a ride off this planet is pretty steep. We still have to find a paying job to get us off this dust ball" he looked up at Trea "You want a ride we can provide that, if you happen to be going our way. You want a ride and the Savareen Brandy you help find us some cargo and/or passengers to hull. You do that and I'll even let you have one of the room to yourself. So we have a deal?" he asked holding out his right hand.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-06 14:16:51)

Trae turned his hazel eyes from Jace to Zeisan when the partly mechanised man spoke. As he had suspected, Zeisan was proving the more savvy. *Or at least more willing to show it*.
He grinned as his opponent's counter-terms were concluded, perfect teeth showing. The assistant mechanic seemed full of energy during the negotiations - perhaps he had missed his calling?
'You have the makings of a merchant prince, friend Zeisan', he commented, looking around at the *Angel*'s interior with a shrewd expression as though contemplating the relative worth of a room on the old bucket.
'Very well', he finally confirmed, offering his own hand but not shaking just yet, 'and easily done if I may add a final term. I will offer your services to make a small delivery for Borgen at a bargain rate so as to smooth the process of my departure from his employ. If that is agreeable, I will also find you a more profitable cargo. Most likely passengers, since there are far more sentient creatures waiting to leave this planet than there are items of value. I'm sure I can locate one or two beings with adequate credit accounts.'
He held his hand opposite Zeisan's, waiting for a shake that would mean a deal was struck or further bargaining, and clearly ready for either.

---

### **Vash** (2010-01-08 10:53:41)

Zeisan shook Trea's hand "I am no where near a merchant prince. I'm just a simply a gun for hire trying to make life easier for the captain." he remarked hoping that he was making life easier for Jace "As for the cargo I'm sure we can hull it as long as it doesn't take up too much room. I'll go with you and secure it. That way I can stay out of Jace's why while she starts replacing the pieces." Zeisan though about moving his things to the cargo hold to free up the other room as well but figured he would wait to see how things went. Hopefully they would just get more cargo. More people just seemed to cause more problems for Jace and himself, but mostly Jace.
Zeisan started walking back to his room "Here I'll show you the living quarters are real quick before we head out. Besides I need to grab my helmet."

---

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-08 11:11:07)

'Excellent,' Trae said after hands were shaken and the deal was struck, 'we are go.'
He followed Zeisan through the ship toward quarters, memorising the layout with a particular eye to where access hatches for important systems were located. He knew what a stock model was like of course, or at least he thought he did in theory. Because of its rarity and relative interest value to the enquiring mind he had researched the Dynamic-class Freighter before. Yet so often with transport ships, particularly rarer ones and those that had seen long service (and this ship legitimately belonged to both groups), you simply couldn't tell how the interior might have been modified until you were standing inside them.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-01-08 17:20:15)

Jace let out the sigh she had been holding in from the moment the negotiations were started. Though she was glad to leave such instances to him, having never been too good with people, she found now that if they ended up with passengers she was going to have to have a stern word with her first mate. The thought of more than just a couple people in close proximity for an extended period made her mind spin. It was certainly going to be a challenge. Already she had brought her barriers up with a vengeance, only picking up the occasional vague thought and only those involving her. A long habit from times when she was on her own, but an ability which had come after considerable practice around Zei.
Watching as the two of them left, she could hear Ziesan as he proceeded to show Trae around. There wasn't much to the ship, being mostly a cargo hauler, there were the two dormitories, made more comfortable at the expense of space and now only held just two crew or passengers each. If passengers were brought on board Zei and Trae would be hard pressed to have their own quarters for long. She was fairly certain her own quarters would continue to remain off limits to anyone but her. Her father at some point during his career had taken out what was once the medbay and replaced it with private quarters. She supposed he had hoped her mother would find such an arrangement more to her liking as would leave her home on Iruji and travel with him. That of course had never happened.
"Crash! Get in here" she yelled through the ship, hoping her contentious droid would come with a minimal amount of complaining. Bending over the crate of parts, she heard the distance clank of the droid's footsteps as he moved closer. They stopped as he reached the doorway to the cargo bay from the corridor near the engine room. "What?" he asked.
"Get over here. We have replacement couplings for the engine." Pulling out said couplings she held one out for Crash to come take, intending on handing them all for the droid to take.
"Goodie. Once we get these fixed the ones around the life support will need to be replaced again."
"So you better get a move on.. Maybe we can get to the next system before that happens." Jace looked up and swore if a droid could roll its eyes Crash would have. The thought made her smile and she quickly turned away before the droid could catch it and have something else to complain about. She ignored the rest of his complaints and quarrelsome remarks as she continues handing him the rest of the needed parts for the next batch of repairs. He walked off, grunting his complaints, leaving Jace in the cargo bay adding what extra there would be to her cargo manifest and mentally sorting where their acquired parts would go. All the while at the back of her mind she kept track of where Zei and Trae were on the ship.

### **Vash** (2010-01-11 22:01:26)

"Ok so that's the tour of this ship. Not much to it but after a while it feels like home. Hopefully it doesn't take that long to get you where you're going. Not to say that you're not welcome..,well you know what I mean." he said rubbing back of his neck "Anyways why don't we go and meet up with your boss so we can get back to work on this ship." He turned around and reached down, picking up his helmet and knocking his heavy assault rifle over in the process. He reached down and tossed the rifle on his bunk before putting his helmet back on "I'll be letting you use this room so if you want to drop anything off feel free to. I'll move my stuff when we get back. If not I'm ready to go."

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-11 23:16:47)

Trae listened to Zeisan with interest. *They seem reluctant to socialise, these two* he thought, intrigued by the fact but careful not to show his mounting curiosity.
'I don't really have any possessions on me,' the mechanic replied to the soldier's offer, patting the empty pockets and pouches of his overalls for emphasis, 'so I'm ready to go now too.'
He took the lead leaving the ship's hangar, and was soon strolling casually along the sandy streets of Anchorhead. He smiled nonchalantly and greeted several of the locals as they walk. Evidently his easygoing and friendly manner made him quite popular. Without incident the two arrived at Borgen's store, a building practically indistinguishable from all the others on the street were it not for its large painted signs bearing Borgen's various shop slogans in a variety of sand-weathered colours.
'Boss!' Trae called as he entered the dim interior, neatly side-stepping a pile of junk parts left haphazardly by the entranceway, 'I've returned.'
'Did you offload that junk?' A raspy voice responded from deeper among the displays, speaking in Bocce.
'It wasn't junk, Boss,' Trae replied in Basic, 'I took them quality parts.'
'You did *what!?*' Borgen exclaimed, clambering into view. The Dug's mean eyes narrowed at the sight of Zeisan, then opened wide.
'Well, you're a good lad for obeying my instruction,' he said, switching to Basic himself, '"Make sure they get quality parts", I said, so that's that.'
Trae grinned.
'That certainly is that, Boss. By the way, I quit.'
Borgen bristled, his entire body seeming to shake in disbelief and mounting anger.
'Its not as bad as it sounds,' Trae explained to prevent an unfortunate recoil, 'since I know you have some off-world deliveries to make, and I've arranged to take one off your hands at a cheap rate. For old time's sake.'
The miserly shopkeeper literally froze mid-shake, cocking his head and looking at Trae in what was clearly meant to be a shrewd manner.
'Well,' he mused, glancing now at Zeisan, 'how cheap would this rate be?'

### **Vash** (2010-01-14 15:16:05)

"That depends on the cargo, where we're taking it, and who we are delivering it to. After all I have to make sure my captain is safe or I'll be back here for a few choice word. You give me all that information and we'll talk about a price." Zeisan was thankful for his helmet. It allowed him to put on the facade that he had no fear and the fact that no one could look him in the eye also helped.
He figured that this man was not willing to give out all the details but he was not going to put any more pressure on Jace. He knew that bringing more people on the ship was almost too much to ask. He would take care on anyone else that got on the ship and would allow her to stay separated from and passengers that they might have to transport.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-16 22:17:41)

The Dug merchant stared up at Zeisan's helmeted head balefully.
'My business, it is an honest one. Around here dishonesty is monopolised and entering the market gets your throat cut. As do many other things, slander included.'
'Now now Boss, the man is just protecting his interests,' Trae said placatingly, 'and in any case I have an order in mind. Don't you have a few crates on the books for your associate's dealership on Ando?'
'How do you know about that?'
'Because I looked, Boss. Did you forget you gave me employee access to the records?'
Borgen's mean eyes glinted.
'Sure. Take that off my hands, its been waiting to be shifted for weeks. There's only one thing: they want it taking to their Nar Shaddaa branch now. I didn't update those records.'

---

### **Vash** (2010-01-20 19:07:34)

"Well we can do it for cheep but I'm going to have to charge extra for the location. How about you take care of our docking fees and refuel our ship. Then we'll call it even. If not then I'm sure you've got something elses we can take." he siad in his same cold tone. He didn't care about making things easy. If he was going to have to take Jace into to an area like Nar Shaddaa then he was going to get everything he could out of this man.
Zeisan crossed his arm across his gut and waited for the man to respond. he still had to fight the urge to simply play the man off and pull on one of his last strings so that Jace would not have to put up with this but he knew that in itself would cause a few problems.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-20 23:34:01)

Borgen growled and looked up at the ceiling in thought, stretching his long neck to its limits.
'You won't get a better deal off any other supply ship Boss,' Trae urged the Dug, 'and I'm leaving no matter what you choose. Where's the harm?'
If the mechanic was bothered by the thought of travelling to the Smuggler's Moon, he wasn't showing it.
Borgen stared at his erstwhile assistant, then looks at Zeisan.
'Very well. I'll pay your fees when delivering the crates.'
The matter decided, he lumbered back into the recesses of the store.
'Well,' Trae said with a grin, 'that wasn't so hard.'

---

### **Vash** (2010-01-21 15:47:18)

Zeisan simply nodded before he turned to leave. He kept his thoughts to himself. This man had no idea how hard things were going to get. Zeisan finly broke his silence, not looking at Trae "Ok I'll take the cargo back. you look into getting us some more cargo. If you can't find any then find us a potential passenger. They still have to pass my inspection first." he said almost as if he was giving orders. With that Zeisan headed off to pick up the cargo and drop it off at the ship.
*****
As Zeisan walked up he pointed out where the cargo need to be dropped off, part of him not wanting to go in and tell Jace what she had to put up with. He took a deep breath and slowly made his way up the ramp as he removed his helmet "Jace...we need to talk. I'm sorry but it seems you may need to put up with a bit more. I tried to avoid it but there was no way around it if we want help fixing up the *Angle*."

---

'Yessah!' Trae replied with a stiff-backed salute, his expression showing him to be amused rather than insulted by Zeisan's orders.
He turned about smartly in impeccable military form (which the ex-Mandalorian might find odd) then relaxed his body and strolled nonchalantly along the street.
After spending some time quizzing businesses about potential cargoes with no luck, he decided to enter the nearest cantina for a drink. *While I'm there I might even find some business*, he thought.
Trae ordered an ale and politely asked the bartender to send any potential business his way, then retreated to a corner table where he settled down to the tasks of enjoying his drink and watching the cantina floor.

Jace had gone back to work, slipping into a junction to replace some of the more hard to get to power couplings. Having sent Crash away to work on the engines outside the ship she was enjoying the quiet. She had been working steadily and was almost done by the time Zeisan stepped up next to the junction and apologized. Poking her head out, she looked him over. "Well...?" she said, waiting for him to continue. Already she knew she wasn't going to like what he had gotten them into if disjointed thoughts of Nar Shaddaa and passengers was any indication.

Soft footfalls were all that let someone know a quiet figure had entered the cantina floor. She made her way around, and towards the bartender, ordering a drink, when her turn came to place one. She was in no hurry, as she pressed her lips to the glass, and sipped it slowly. Soft, light blue eyes glanced about in vague curiousity.
Kumiko waited for a moment, until the barkeeper was a bit less busy, before she asked her question. Figuring it couldn't hurt to try once more, before she gave for the day. She'd been having somewhat rotten luck that day, and thus far had found no one willing to get her offside. She'd tried asking around, but nothing had come from it.
She was dressed in loose fitting black pants, that fell to her ankles, with thick black boots, that tapped lightly as she walked. She sighed softly, as she set down the drink, to twist her hair up, and into a loose bun. She handed over her payment, as the barkeeper motioned her off.

Since he was very deliberately watching both the entrance and the cantina bar, Trae noticed the girl almost as soon as she walked in. His gaze tracked her as she crossed the floor, and he took a small sip of his drink.
Savouring the taste of the frothy liquid on his lips and tongue, he continued to watch as the object of his attention exchanged a few words with the bartender who motioned away from the bar: in his direction.
The mechanic grinned and put his glass down. Perhaps finding some business would not be so difficult after all.

Kumiko left the drink unfinished, as she began walking over to the table, the barkeeper had motioned her towards. Perhaps she might have better luck this time around. The soft *tap, tap* of her boots on the cantina floor, oddly made her want to head over a bit faster.
She was both nervous and excited. Though her nervousness won over, when she reached the edge of the table. "Hello." She raised her hand in greeting, but did not offer it. Unsure, if he was really willing to talk. "I had asked a question, and the barkeeper motioned me over to you." She explained, hoping her voice wasn't wavering as much as it sounded to her.
She shuffled her feet from side to side, and lowered her hand back to her side, resting it on her hip. She leaned slightly to the left, as she glanced him over a little. *"Worst case scenario…He turns me away."* she thought to herself. A smile tugged her lips upward into a small curve.

Kumiko found that she had been directed to a human male in mechanic's overalls. And yet, despite the plain and down-to-earth image presented by his clothes and surroundings, the man had the looks and bearing of a HoloVid star.
'Then the question must have been about off-world passage,' he replied, returning her smile in friendly and rather dazzling fashion.
'My name is Trae,' he continued, then motioned to the chair across from him, 'and please, take a seat. It will be awkward holding a conversation with you standing and myself sitting!'

### **Anonymous** (2010-02-07 13:22:05)

"My name is Kumiko. It is nice to meet you." she told him politely in return, as she sat down, placing her hands in her lap as she did so. "Yes, actually, that's just what my question was about. Though I'm afraid I'm a bit unsure, why he directed me to you." She let herself relax a bit, and settled in to talk for the moment.
One would find, if they happened to look, that she was dressed in dark brown pants, with one unknown small black smudge on her left knee. Her shirt was gray, and hung loosely, thought it fit her form. On her back, was a bag, which she set between her feet, and held onto tightly.
"Maybe you could answer my question." she tried, still smiling, and half expecting to be told away. Somehow, she was hoping it might turn out a different set.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-02-07 13:35:49)

'He directed you to me since I asked him to show any potential business of that nature my way,' Trae explained, looking at Kumiko in a manner that strongly suggested he was assessing her, 'because I'm here as a representative for a ship looking for cargo or paying passengers.'
'Admittedly,' he added, 'the crew would ideally prefer cargo, but if you can offer an attractive enough payment for transporting you off this dustball I'm sure I can change their mind. Do you have a particular destination planned?'

### **Vash** (2010-02-07 14:09:14)

Zeisan looked down for a moment and then finely looked up "I...well...we have to go to Nar Shaddaa, and it seems that finding cargo will not be easy so it looks like we have to take a few passengers. You don't have to worry too much I'll be dealing with them so you won't even have to go near them." he said dropping his shoulders as he leaned against on of the bulkheads. I just wanted to let you know so you could get ready. If we get too many I'll sort them out and let them crash in the bunks. I can always take the cargo hold. The cargo should be here in a bit. Good thing is the guy is going to pay four our docking fees and pay to refuel and resupply us when we get to Nar Shaddaa." he added trying to make the deal sound a bit better. "So hopefully that makes it a bit easier to forgive me after we unload people." he smiled

### **Anonymous** (2010-02-07 16:47:24)

"I don't have a destination planned." Kumiko paused a moment, before she continued, a bit unsure of what to say. She turned her gaze to meet Trae's eyes. "I can pay, that's not a problem." Really, she was pretty much willing to go just about anywhere at this time. She'd found work, but she was bored. But she didn't think it was either the time, nor the place to state such things.
"I came here with cargo. I sold most of it, but there are a few boxes left. Might they be willing to transport it and myself, if I payed for the expenses to get where they are willing to take me?" She asked, trying to explain a little. "The cargo is ship parts, I've come across, and tools that I use in my line of work." She shifted in her seat, wondering what he would say.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-02-07 16:59:18)

While Trae listened he finished his drink, though his eyes never wavered from Kumiko, the man keeping eye contact with her throughout her explanation. Afterwards he smiled reassuringly.
'I think its probable that such an arrangement would be satisfactory,' he said in thoughtful tones, 'though I cannot speak for certain in place of the ship's captain. I'm only a lowly representative after all!'
'So, your line of work is as a mechanic?' he asked conversationally, deviating suddenly from the current topic.

### **Anonymous** (2010-02-07 21:36:17)

"Yes." She quipped excitedly in reply. She enjoyed her work as a mechanic, and didn't mind letting others know it. Not that she'd meant to come across that way. It just sort of happened.
"How about you?" She was curious, and figured that he might just shy away from it, if he didn't want to answer. "How long have you been working for the ship's captain?" She smiled, meaning it to be friendly conversation. Nothing more, nothing less. "What is the ship like?"
"What do I have to do?" She asked then, unsure of the anwer.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2010-02-07 21:46:42)

Trae seemed amused by Kumiko's excitable reply.
'I'm a mechanic myself, actually,' he told her, gesturing to his overalls, 'and as for how long I've been on the crew, I'm a veteran now at just over a standard hour!'
He grinned.
'Funny story, I only just finagled my own way onboard. Finding some cargo or passengers is part of my arrangement for passage. The ship... is one of the old *Dynamic*-class, if you know it? Quite the old workhorse. And as for what you do: absolutely nothing since you're a paying customer. Although if you wanted to help me out around the ship I wouldn't complain about the company.'

### **Anonymous** (2010-02-08 18:48:33)

"Nice to meet a fellow mechanic." She smiled, sincerely this time. It was always fun to her, to get to. "I would be glad to help you out." Her smiled widened into a slight grin, at the thought of a ship like that. It made her want to laugh, but she suppressed it to a giggle. It was funny how he'd put it.
She leaned forward slightly, tapping a finger to her cheek. "Will I get to see this 'old workhorse'?" she wondered, not really minding if she voiced the thought out loud. She brushed her fingers through her hair, shaking it loose, and pocketing what she'd tied it back with. It had been getting on her nerves to have it up, and not down like she was used to.
"What's it's crew like?" She asked, turning her gaze back to him.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2010-02-08 20:43:36)

'They're pleasantly peculiar. And considering the port we're in, peculiarly pleasant. You'll like them,' Trae replied assuredly, dealing with the last question first.
He then moved on to the first question:
'I expect you'll have to see the "workhorse" at some point since you're considering riding it,' he said, giving Kumiko a grin and a wink, 'I'll escort you over to its stable as soon as you're ready, shall I?'

### **Alicia** (2010-02-10 10:51:38)

Jace let our a heavy sigh, knowing that at some point they were going to have to do something in order to get the Angel back to par. If that involved bringing passengers on board, well, she would just have to deal with it. Climbing out she leaned against the bulk. "I'm not angry, Zei. We have to do what we have to do. If that involves picking up some passengers fine. As for Nar Shadaa... As long as its a quick stop, then it will be fine too."
She had never been to the planet before, truthfully she had always avoided it. Now it seemed she was being led there, taunted by a what she wanted most. To have her father's ship back to its original glory.
Turning back to the junction to check to see if her work was done, she said with a sigh. "I'll want to meet our new passengers, better get cleaned up." She doubted anyone would want to meet the captain of the vessel they would be depending on in this state. Putting a greasy hand on her friend's elbow she reiterated. "Everything will be fine," she said with a smile. "Why don't you go make sure the quarters are ready for multiple passengers. I'm going to get cleaned up."

Soren pulled the hood of his robe up and slipped through the streets of Anchorhead. The Force had truly been with him; he wouldn't in a million years have expected to find that his contact had full holonet access. As he headed toward the spaceport, the conversation he had had with his master, Sing Loro, replayed in his head.
*"Master, I've determined that Ashto isn't on Tatooine. There's no sign of him or any of his crew at the safehouses, and there's no word of him on the streets."
"Don't worry, my apprentice. He's not here on Andooweel, either, but I know where he's headed. He's taken a small group of ships to Nar Shaddaa. He's meeting with the head of a major Hutt clan. We can capture him if we move quickly, and deal a blow to the Hutts as well. Contact me by comlink once you get there. Do you have any questions?"
"No, Master." He smiled slightly. "I only hope the Smuggler's Moon is ready for our return. We're very popular there."
Loro chuckled. "Yes, yes we are. I'll see you soon, my boy. May the Force be with you. Loro out."*
Hurrying while trying to look like he wasn't in a hurry, Soren soon reached a cantina near the spaceport that his contact had directed him to. "Many of the best freighter captains frequent the place," he had said. "The bartender always knows who is in port and who is leaving soon." He slipped in mostly unnoticed and spoke briefly with the bartender, before making his way to a table where a dark haired human woman and a very handsome blond human man appeared to be finishing their conversation.
He drew back his hood, revealing his young bearded face with his sad brown eyes and longish brown hair. "Please, forgive me for interrupting," he said to the man, "but I'm looking for passage to Nar Shaddaa. Can you get me there, or at least take me in the right direction?

Trae turns his smile on the newcomer, offering his right hand across the table.
'Trae,' he introduces himself in a friendly manner, 'ship's mechanic on the *Reluctant Angel*. Now, I might be able to persuade the crew to take a little detour to the Smuggler's Moon for the right price. May I ask, is the purpose of your journey business or pleasure?'

Kumiko smiled at the person who'd approached, and waited quietly. While she waited, she glanced him over, studying him with her eyes. Though she turned them away, realizing it might come across as being rather rude. She was worried about such a thing, and instead let herself wonder what the man's answer would be. Would he be a fellow passenger, if they both were allowed by the captain?

Zeisan nodded with a small smile before he took off his helmet "Right I'll do what I can." he started as he turned to walk away "Oh do you want to let bucket head know we have more people coming or does he just get to find out?" he asked as walking away. He made his way to the sleeping quarters and straightened them up as best he could, but his larger rifle and other weapon, armor, and other small mechanical parts made it hard to looks clean. He let out a small sigh as he gathered up his things and made his way to the cargo hold. After making sure the cargo secured he cleared off the work bench and set his things down. He looked down at his left arm and let out a small sigh before he pulled out his tool kit. He opened up a small hatch on his forearm to reveal the inner working of his arm. He looked at some of the parts that he had been working on and began to slowly replace what he could with his home-brewed parts, after all mando tech was not something you could just go around and ask about. He flipped on his comm while he worked and tuned it in to Trae "Having any luck out there?" he asked

'Excuse me,' Trae says to the two at his table as he feels the vibration of his comm unit. Reaching up behind his ear, he clicks it twice to accept the call.
'I have two potential clients right here,' he replies, smiling towards his guests as he does so, 'and one of them has a small amount of cargo with her. I was just asking the gentleman the details about his requirements. Apparently he needs to get to Nar Shaddaa. I told him you might be willing to take a detour there for the right price. What do you think?'

Soren smiled, but the young woman was alreay turning her head away. *Shy, i guess,* he thought, and waited patiently for the young man to finish his conversation.

Nar Shaddaa, the Smuggler's Moon, a dirty hive for dirty dealings in which the underworld element scuttle about like insects serving their Queen. A Queen known as Profit, who feeds on crime. For a law abilding citizen of the Galaxy, Nar Shaddaa is not exactly an ideal rest stop, but for someone with something to hide, it is a perfect place to be lost.
Trae reflected on this as he performed some minor repair work on the *Reluctant Angel*'s outer hull. Fixing up the freighter seemed like a never-ending task.
They had made port on the previous day and dealt with their passengers and cargo. Now they were waiting to see if they could pick up any more jobs. He knew Zeisan or Jace had put the *Angel* on the port's register of passenger ships, thugh so far they had no bites. He intended to try his luck at a cantina like he had in Anchorhead. Just as soon as he was done here, of course.
He activated his comm unit with a click.
'I'm about done up here. The hull is secure, at least. Honestly, there's a few panels that could do with replacing but they'll hold out for ages as long as you don't get into any rough spots. How're things looking inside?'
Of course, he knew the answer to his question already: he'd seen behind some of those access panels...

"You want the real answer or the sugar coated version?" Zeisan was busy in one of the maintenance hatches trying to patch up what he could "Let me put it this way, we *should* make it to Nar Shadda." As he spoke he half doubted his own statement, but he quickly cleared his mind. It was thought like that that would cause problems. He closed the hatch and locked it taking a few deep breaths. It was something he learned to do to calm his mind, though it rarely worked.
As he walked to the cockpit he ran his hands along the walls and smiled a bit. Thinking back to some of his early adventures aboard the *Angle* he couldn't help but think of all the things that he had been through. He finely made his way up to the cockpit and flipped few switches as he sat down "Hey Trae I'm going to run a pre-flight check. I'll let you know if anything comes up. Also watch for any sparks or smoke, or fires, or small explo...you know what just watch for anything bad." He checked to see that all the major systems were green then flipped his com over to Jace "Hey Jace I'm going to run a pre-flight check. You working on anything major?"
