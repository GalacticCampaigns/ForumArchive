**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Designed and built by Rakata forces during the reign of the Infinite Empire this droid was originally designated as a Battlefield Combat Analyst Droid. Programmed to assist battlefield commanders in field tactics or be capable of overseeing small operations independently the model saw little battlefield deployment, instead many were assigned to remote outposts to keep slave populations under control. When the Rakata fell ill to the Force Plague and the Empire began to fall apart, revolts and rebellions sprang up across the galaxy.
BCAD-344 was one of the few left in service on a remote world when the enslaved population rebelled against the Infinite Empire and over threw their captors. After weeks of fighting and heavy losses the planet's remaining forces were pushed into a corner. 344 having had taken heavy damage and his shield generator unrepairable had retreated to a supply depot that was now mostly empty and organized a last stand in hopes of out maneuvering the slaves with better tactics against their larger numbers. Unfortunately during this last battle several explosions from misguided rockets created a rock slide above the depot which essentially buried it under several hundred metric tons of rubble. 344 was effectively cut off from the remaining Rakata Forces, mainly battle droids, and too damaged to self repair his internal power supply slowly ran out.
BCAD-344 laid dormant inside the buried supply depot for an untold amount of years before being discovered by a salvage team following old stories of battles past. Having dug out an path to the depot they entered finding most in ruin, and structurally unsound. When they discovered 344 in a state of heavy disrepair they thought of the credits they would make from the find if it could be made operational again. They quickly attempted repairs so that they could power it up and affixed a restraining bolt but were surprised when the bolt did not restrain 344 as it opened fire on the trio with a concealed pulse-wave blaster in its right arm. Between surprise and the close range 344 dispatched the three then froze over their bodies with what seemed an eternity to him.
He found himself confused, his programming instructed him to kill and maintain control of slave populations but he felt ashamed, guilty, of what he had just done. Was it a fault in his programming caused by damage to his processor or memory core or was it the unknown amount of years he had been dormant, he did not know. His functionality only at 55% he gathered the needed tools and attempted further repairs on himself well into the next day before realizing that he again was unable to repair the damage to his power systems and began shutting down to preserve his memory core.

**Raven's Story**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Brief Background:**
Sarna also known as Raven is the child of Jason StarRunner a Jedi Master and Serini Bell a Fallanassi from a small group of Fallanassi on Lucazec. Jason was originally on a diplomatic mission that would’ve taken him pass the Lucazec system, but instead his ship suffered mechanic problems that caused his ship to crash land near a village where Serini Bell lived. Serini was able to save the only surviving member of the crash, an unconscious Jason StarRunner. At firs the Fallanassi circle wished to let Jason to perish to keep their order a secret, but Serini disobeyed the order and instead nursed Jason back to health falling in love with him in the process. While not thrilled by the survival of Jason, the Fallanassi circle forced Jason to server all communication with the order and remain under constant surveillance by members of the circle. While Serini never pushed her luck in getting married with Jason, she stayed with him eventually giving birth to Sarna.
It was quiet clear that once Sarna was born she was a force sensitive with the potential for some powerful raw ability, but there was debate on what training she should take. The argument was for Leylia to follow the ways of the Fallanassi Circle or receive training from her father which both sides were adamant determined for Sarna follow their individual training plan. After long discussions and debates it was agreed that Sarna was to be trained with the circle ideals with some minor training done by Jason. With the dual training Sarna learned a few of the secrets of both, but at the same time Sarna had a hard time warping her head over both philosophies combined.
**Past Adventures:**
When word of the Mandalorian Wars reached Lucazec the circle wondered what sort of threat the Mandalorian threat posed to the Fallanassi and asked for volunteers to scout the potential of the raiders, with Sarna being one of them. Although the Circle wanted each member to stay out of the war, but Sarna found she was unable to stay as a silent observer with so much suffering entered the war on the side of the Republic as commissioned pilot where she earned the call sign “Raven”. During the war it was discovered that Sarna who was now going by her call sign was force sensitive and had some force training managed to become an informal padawan of another Jedi in the war. During her service in the war of pilot of drop ship for infiltration group, started to pick up Mando'a through various missions, and self study to make her task easier when behind enemy lines. Raven also participated in the battle of Malachor V, but was injured and became unconscious piror to the mass shadow generators were operated and sent to hospital ward and left behind when Revan and Malak took their fleet into the unknown.
Raven questioned if she should return home as she wondered what the consequence were for entering the war and so she informed the Fallanssi she would serve her commission until it ended to avoid drawing attention back to Lucazec with AWOL officer.
During the intermitted time between the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil war to reflect and calm her mind from the horrors she had witteness from the Mandalorian Wars trying to rid her of the dark taint the war brought. However just before her commission ended the Jedi Civil war went hot, Raven was forced to renter the war. This time Raven however stayed away from Jedi fearing that they could succumb to the Dark side more easily than other people in her eyes.
**Personality:**
Raven is cheerful woman despite some of the horrors and has a slight distrust of the Jedi, but know most mean well. As result she tries extra hard to hide her force sensitivity when she knows Jedi are around, but is willing to work with them.
**You're Good at?..:**
Raven is a skilled pilot (not the best but good), and with combination of her ability to stealth she was able to infiltrate behind enemy lines quiet easily.
**What were you up to …**
It eventually became known Raven was skilled force practitioner which further feared reprisals from the Fallanassi circle stayed away from home after the war as a self-imposed exile. And with the knowledge of Raven being a force sensitive with abilities similar to Jedi, most bounty hunters treated her as such hoping to collect, which drove Raven further into hiding.
**Description**
Raven is about 5’ 7” with a slim build. Raven tends to keep her hair long despite being in hiding (when asked it’s basically “it’s a F&*^ you to bounty hunters”), but occasionally lets her dye job lapse resulting in her black roots showing. Despite having good eyesight, Raven wares assorted eye glasses covering her hazel eyes. Raven tends to wear plain shirt and pants nothing flamboyant, but something more in common to the local fashion of the area.

Character Description
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Description:
Primes has the appearance of a 22 year old human due the the accelerated growth rate of clones. He doesn't have a notable appearance because in the Grand Army of the Republic it's hard for a soldier to stand out. One has to make their presence known by actions. He has the standard armor of a Clone Commando, one of a highly skilled four person team used for complicated or delicate missions. He added orange-detailing and places to stow his tools on his armor, both holdovers from his previous job as a ordnance disposal technician.
Brief Background:
For the first ten years of a clone's life, they learn loyalty, discipline, and how to be an effective soldier from a combination of automated learning and a small cadre of Mandalorians. Not everyone clone makes it through the process. Those who do not show the standard qualities are viewed as "defective" and treated just like any other damaged product on an assembly line. Throughout his schooling, CT-357 skirted the edge.
In automated classes, Primes would pay more attention to the working of the console than the comparative battle tactics displayed on it. His curiosity drove him to pry at the edges of everything. On the way to classes, Primes would drop out of line to stop and bother Kaminoan technicians and clone masters with questions about what they were doing. He managed to meet standards, not knowing that his life depended on it. Then he ended up in a war, where his life depended on how well he and his brothers could use what they learned.
He served an uneventful few months in ordnance disposal but a critical mission put him in the limelight and qualified him for a nickname and a commando slot, even though it wasn't what he was bred for.
Personality:
Curiosity above all. Primes loves to learn, and likes to learn by deconstructing. He's torn apart much more than he's put back together and most of the things he has put together were intended to explode. He approaches skills, philosophy, and everything else the same way. This is why socializing with other people still remains a mystery to Primes, if you try to deconstruct someone's beliefs they usually react with hostility. And deconstructing people just leads to a mess. Getting along with other clones is easy, they all feel like brothers and everyone respects your skill however you contribute, but anyone else is alien and strange to Primes.
You're Good at?..:
Primes has a major in demolitions, with a minor in computers and droids. He likes to prepare a scenario as much as possible, preferably with explosives, and then use heavy weapons to finish the job as soon as possible. He likes to gain other kinds of knowledge, but his skill as a soldier has always come first. His later experiences with a commando time has taught him that sometimes more covert methods are needed, but he knows what he likes.
Previous Adventures:
Early Life
Primes got in lots of trouble during his initial training. He would take something apart and then take one of the components to the nearest Kaminoan Technician and ask about it's function. If it was recognized as something that shouldn't be in pieces, Primes would try to disappear in a crowd of clones with varying degrees of success. The most serious thing he did was unlock a whole classroom full of learning consoles to play any video the student chose, instead if the scheduled learning. All the students had a blast, looking at weapons demonstrations, staring wide-eyed at summaries of different alien species they had never seen before, and even tapping into local Kaminoan entertainment channels. CT-357 himself randomly found an advanced training demo for the commando program, detailing the uses of shaped charges and demolitions. When the authority figures showed up and demanded to know who had done this, each and every student insisted that they had done it. That was when CT-357 learned to trust his brothers.
The War
CT-357 was a sergeant of ordnance disposal squad, which mostly involved the boring and dangerous job of clearing mines to make way for large ground vehicles. Primes loved it though, he saved every piece of deactivated equipment he could, he struggled with a bulging pack every day on at least a half dozen different worlds. The event that catapulted him toward his destiny however was just around the corner.
On a dustball planet, covered in mesas, cliffs, and steep draws, the convoy of vehicles behind CT-357 caused the edge to give way, spilling his unit and a dozen vehicles to the earth below. As the surviving clones crawled from the overturned vehicles, they could see CIS dropships in the far distance, unloading what seemed to be an army of clankers. They were practically defenseless. CT-357 rummaged through his gathered junk and pulled out mine after mine, telling his squadmates to come out into the field and help him activate them before attack at nightfall. All those nights he spent modifying the mines' Friend/Foe Identification was going to pay off.
That bloody night, pinned down in the twisted fortifications of their vehicles, the clones desperately fought against overwhelming odds. "Fall Back! We have to pull them in closer!" CT-357 yelled. The droids closed in, the unthinking machines completely unsuspecting of what was obviously friendly CIS-deployed ordnance. "WHAT NOW?" one of his squadmates yelled, dragging himself into cover beside CT-357. "We're Dyin'! WHAT DO WE DO NOW?"
CT-357 looked around the edge of the smoking hulk of the ground transport they were behind, confirming the position of the enemy. "WE PRIME IT!" He yelled back, pressing his remote.
In the darkness, just visible through the muzzle flashes, the field lit up with the blinking lights of dozens of mines arming. The droids stopped firing. CT-357 stood up in the darkness and screamed, "ROGER ROGER THIS YOU CLANKING BASTARDS!"
In that flash and roar, Primes felt reborn.

Recent Events
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

And as for the immediate events that put Primes out of commission:
The next morning on the surface, CT-357 and the few survivors from that night's battle were evacuated by gunship. The squad talked about the battle while a group of ARC troopers sharing the transport sat in the rear quietly, not fraternizing with the common soldiers.
When they landed at the nearest Command Post with orbital transports, CT-357 gathered up his squad to unload gear and report to remaining battalion elements. "You hold on just a minute, Sargent." came a voice from behind him, somehow gruffer than a usual clone's speech. The rest of Primes' squad turned to look at what was going on. "No, you squaddies keep moving, you already have your orders."
CT-357 knew that ARC troopers were different from most clones, but he had no idea how different. They all had names for one thing. The captain of their team introduced himself as 'Tabs' and the other two troopers under his command called themselves 'Shims' and 'Hardy'. They explained that they had lost their demolitions expert in action on the surface and that their mission was to 'disable' a hidden facility on the planet. "As a matter of fact," Tabs said, "Your unit happened to stumble pretty close to it, that's why there were so many enemy soldiers there." He sat down in one of the seats and motioned for CT-357 to do the same. "Hardy over there thinks you're still a shiny*, but I heard your guys talking and I've got a feeling you lost some polish last night." He motioned to Shims and Hardy and they dropped a packed field ruck in CT-357's lap. "Anyway, it's my call and you're getting 'voluntold' to get attached to our team on a probationary status for an indefinite period. And the good news doesn't stop there because I came up with the perfect new designation for you... Primes." *derogative term for clone soldiers fresh from Kamino.
Primes served on that team from then on, up until a mission right near Order 66. They had never worked closely with Jedi before, and ARC troopers were infamous for telling Jedi Generals exactly what they thought of their 'battle plans' and 'tactical experience'. The team had a taciturn Jedi with them, a female Kel Dor named 'Tuun Lat', for a stealth mission to a orbital Seperatist facility suspected of producing Commando Droids with Clone Trooper facades with additional rumors of horrifying experiments such as robotic parasites and droid infiltrators. They had a stasis tube on board for a scientist they were meant to capture, and a mission to 'disable' the rest of the facility. Primes shuddered. "Spare me the details, Captain, let's just disable the hell out of it."
Just as they got off the surface, Captain Tabs got the word for Order 66. Shims and Hardy got the transmission as well and looked on in concern as Captain Tabs seemed to argue over his comlink. "That can't be right! Check again!" He yelled into the comlink, standing up. The Jedi piloting their craft looked back at this, still silent but unaware of the transmission. "We have to, sir." Shims said, standing up. Hardy stood up too, silently making his intentions known as well.
Primes was in the back prepping equipment with his helmet, and integrated comlink, sitting up in the passenger section with the team. "Source this transmission, Primes! I think that the Seperatists are up to some sort of freakiness." Then the Captain suddenly stopped his furious pacing. "What the hell do you mean, acceptable losses?" Tabs tore off his helmet, face pale. "Check the sensors, Jedi!" He stomped up towards the cockpit. Shims and Hardy ran after him with different intentions for the Jedi. Tuun Lat turned back towards the clones, finally realizing some of them had murderous intentions. "Stand down, you two. Those orders can't be right." Tabs said, turning to face Shims and Hardy. They had already unslung their weapons. Tuun Lat stepped out in front of the captain, her green lightsaber springing to life.
Primes was at the terminal when he heard that hum. He had seen holos, he'd heard it before, he knew what it meant, and he had to stop it. In the time it took for him to grab a rifle and head up there the fight had already ended. Hardy and Tabs were on the ground, possibly dead and Shims bent over to pick something up. "We shot her, but the Jedi traitor has fled. Tabs is a traitor as well and paid the price. Help me find her. Now." Primes was aghast, "What are you talking about Shims? What did you do to Captain Tabs?" He rushed past Shims to get to the Captain's limp form when he heard a hum and felt a fire in his belly. Primes looked and saw the green beam skewering his torso, held by Shims. "Traitor it is. Then die by the Jedi traitor's weapon!" Shims pulled the beam back and Primes fell to his knees.
Primes saw his assailant raise the blade again to cut him down, but it was pulled from his hand. Shims turned to take a lazy, grazing blow all the way up from the bottom of his torso. Primes fell the rest of the way to the ground, but was pulled up into a sitting position by the kneeling Tuun Lat. "You're... hurt." Primes gasped. "We need to contact the listening post." Tuun Lat shook her head. "They've already fired torpedoes from the surface. It is not likely we will survive. Make your peace." Then the ship was hit.
(That's the first I've heard her talk.) Primes thought in a absent-minded way as everything faded to black. (She's got a pretty voice.)
In a half-awake state of blood loss, Primes was dragged to the stasis pod by the mortally wounded Tuun Lat as the ship quickly started to depressurize from multiple hull breaches. That part of the job done, Tuun Lat crawled back to the cockpit and told the computer to eject all compromised systems, including life support. "Power should run to the stasis pod for a while." She said, before pulling off her normal Kel Dorian rebreather and goggles, and shutting her eyes.
*So the gist is his team leader either didn't believe or was trying to disobey Order 66 when it happened, so after the two "loyal" team members failed to kill their officer and the Jedi with them the other clones blew up the ship ensure the Jedi's demise. The intel they had about the facility was flat-out misinformation spread by Seperatists. Primes is under the impression that some sinister Seperatist experiment, plot or technology was in play and he'll stay pretty freaked out about the idea of robotic parasites and replicants and such for a long time from now. That way he was in that stasis tube for however long the story needs. He doesn't necessarily remember immediately that he was saved by Tuun Lat.
