### **Alicia** (2014-03-29 22:43:11)

Welcome to Forgotten Ones! This thread will be used to carry on any Out of Character conversations.

---

### **Alicia** (2014-04-06 19:54:26)

Just wanted to throw a couple notes out there:
1. I will try to post every couple days regardless of whether everyone has posted or not. This will keep things moving but will mean that you, as a player will have to catch up on reactions, etc. If you miss three posts then you will get a verbal strike indicating your activity has not been up to par and you will have a couple days to catch up.
2. Since this story is about your characters anything you want to throw in is fair game just as long as it's not "out there". If you have an idea I don't like in your post, I'll discuss it with you to allow for changes.
3. Subscribe to the forum. This will give you email notifications for anything that happens in Forgotten Ones, not just the game thread.
If you ever have any questions about what I write up, please feel free to ask here in the OOC. More than likely you're not sure then the others may be as well. Usually I may even go back into the post and edit for clarification.

OH... I forgot to mention. Your posts may be updated/edited up until the point I submit my next post.
So if you aren't happy about it, then go ahead and change it. It's not going to be set in stone till I submit mine.
I will generally do an initial read when it's posted and reread it when I go to write my post. Just make sure you check the box at near the submit which indicates the post was edited. You don't even really need to give a reason I just need to know it was changed so I don't overlook anything.

Dude, the rules for Scavenger say you can only roll once per item you're building, but it doesn't say someone *else* can't *also* roll to help with that item. We could each roll our **Perception** and then trick out BCAD with rocket launchers and stuff. Make him into a battle tank. I *think* I get to use my +15 modifier from *Use the Force* for the roll even. You have *Tech Specialist* even, so this is *absolutely possible*. Raven has *Force Pilot* so we should let her drive.

### **Jake** (2014-04-07 23:43:10)

I'm definitely not in the know. I'm just seeing that "persistent conditions do not prevent you from moving up the condition track by means other than the recover action or resting for 8 hours." I don't know if my feat qualifies. On the other hand, It says persistent conditions are caused by things like poison and hunger though and I don't see "Shaking it Off" making anyone less hungry.
Either way, Primes is commencing the panic-flail.

### **Jake** (2014-04-07 23:48:42)

However! Do we roll our own dice? I'm not sure between the two actions (raw strength or unarmed) but I could roll 'em both and if the feat's no good, subtract 2 afterward.
Strength

***13*** <- [12] 1d20 + 1

Unarmed

***13*** <- [9] 1d20 + 4

dmg

***8*** <- [4] 1d4 + 4

### **Ryder2101** (2014-04-07 23:50:18)

Yes we roll our own, I just had an issue when I first posted that Alicia had to check, ended up being the app I'm using didn't parse correctly

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-08 06:42:57)

So the thing about the Condition Track/Hibernation Sickness is that while I believe you can still move up the track in some ways, it doesn't erase your actual *affliction*. In this case, my guess would be that you're going to suffer that -10 to Perception until someone actually treats you but you might move yourself up the CT slowly on your own, by doing kind of what you did. The important part in that section (p.149, Core) is that "*…by satisfying the requirements stated in its descriptor…*" line. The GM said "*…suffer a persistent -2 on the CT **until treated** and a -10 total on Perception checks when it comes to vision (won’t be counting the penalty from CT).*"
Think about Han - "I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur." He says that when he's no longer sweaty or panic-y, standing on his own. He's getting better, but still afflicted by the blindness.

### **Alicia** (2014-04-08 10:41:47)

OK... Here's the thing all Shake It Off does is allow you to spend less time *naturally Recovering* (2 swift instead of the normal 3). With a persistent condition you cannot naturally recover and as such cannot Shake it Off is not a viable way to remove the Persistent Condition. Ways to remove the Persistent Condition penalty? Abilities like Equilibrium.. Well I think that's the only one off the top of my head.
Only time or proper treatment will remove the Persistent Condition brought on by hibernation sickness.

### **Alicia** (2014-04-08 12:08:58)

I'm amending what I said about the blindness as I remember that Saga actually has rules for it:
A blinded creature can't see and takes a -2 penalty to Reflex Defense, loses its Dexterity bonus to Reflex Defense (if any), moves at half speed, and takes a -5 penalty on Perception checks. All opponents are considered to have total concealment (page 156) to the blinded creature. All checks and actions that rely on vision (such as reading) fail automatically.
Because of the additional effects of hibernation you'll still be Persistent -2 CT, but with the added penalties for blindness. So -4 to Reflex, -2 to everything else, -5 to Perception (instead of -10), etc.

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-08 19:16:27)

I could be wrong, but I think Preview with dice tags messes things up. I usually do the preview of the text, then add in the dice tags once I'm all done editing. I might be wrong about that though.

---

### **Alicia** (2014-04-08 19:27:07)

You can preview with the dice tags but it will just say something like "Invalid dice string" or something to that effect until it's actually posted.

**Tari** is the name of the character I'm playing, he's a Shard - Shard is the species, Tari is the name. Unless we want to just adopt that sort of nomenclature, in which case I think Droid should try and rescue me and then we'll get Clone and Fallanassi. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

So does anyone have an opinion on whether a clone trooper would know about the conflicts Raven is talking about? It's military history but still a couple millenia ago. On the other hand, clones were raised somewhat in the Mandolorian tradition. I'm feeling like it's 50/50.

I knew nothing about the game till you pointed it out... Funny how people get the same ideas without knowing.
If you read the last book in the Saga, BW, I think you'd quickly see why it's not a stretch for me to combine SHODAN and Jane.

Heh...you're right not to trust the droid's programming just yet...he's confused enough with internal conflicts, memory leaks, and apparent time displacement.
Good news is, he didn't fire on you yet, which is already a conflict of his base programming.
Survival, repair, and understanding are his priorities at the moment. Cooperation with unknown organics at this point, logically, makes sense to him.

In the event that any of you wanted a better visual than what Google Image Search could give me for "*red crystal*", I imagine Tari as having been broken a bit when he was ripped out of his droid body. Not severely, just sort of like the last couple centimeters of his crystal shattered. Parts of the socket he was installed into sort of stuck with him and during the time when he was unconscious his mind sort of used the Force to graft and refit the pieces into his crystal body, making him a kind of cyborg. I picture the makeshift vocabulator as being little more than a speaker and some wires - hence the monotone voice. The wires/filaments, I think, sort of run up through the crystal just a bit, where the hairline fractures may have run.
In essence, imagine someone dropping the speaker out of one side of a pair of headphones (with a few inches of its wiring) into a bowl of red Jell-O in the shape of a foot-long crystal, only the Jell-O hardens like glass afterward, and the speaker was floating with the wire dangling down (so it's not totally encapsulated).
If that helps at all. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

Q? Regarding your force abilities. Do you require tools to *force repair* or does the droid *magically* heal when its used and how long does it take?
Sent from my DROID RAZR using Tapatalk

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-12 17:51:11)

Interestingly, I don't require tools. I'm able to use *vital transfer* on droids just like on a person, I heal naturally and can enter a Force Trance just like a person, and can spend a swift action to appear as nothing more than a droid to a Force-user. It's pretty rad actually. Magic is awesome! <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

### **Ryder2101** (2014-04-12 18:22:35)

So its only HP transfer. OK. Was wondering if it worked like the repair skill. Guess we'll have to wait till we find tools before 344 looses his persistent CTs

Q? Alicia, the lockers I take it are secured until the correct person attempts access. Do they unlock when they attempt to open it or do they have to touch the screen with the matching image next to each locker? Or maybe voice coded?
Though if we were taken while unconscious voice printing would probably be out...

Hey Jake, I'm having a hard time determining what is thought and spoken for Primes in some of your posts
Well we *could* possibly use one of those sabers to cut into the lockers but 344, never have seeing one before, wouldn't know to suggest it. Sabers didn't exist until some time after the Infinite Empire collapse. But time is if the essence, maybe we can come back after the *threat* has been assessed or neutralized.

There's no true standard since people have their own way of reflecting speech, thoughts and actions in writing.
How I tend to distinguish is "**speech**", *thought*, action. I avoid colors as there's two differently colored themes our members use regularly (Jedi Knight [beige/brown background] and our default [boring white]. Tapatalk will use either white or black background ). If you use the color chart linked in the post above to find a color you like that works universally, power to you.

BW sounds good, I decided for 344 to stay on the defensive. The whole out of time thing has his logic circuits tied up, sticking with the known until fully repaired seemed best.
Good news is 344 is at full HP just suffering the +4CT (-10) persistent on all rolls from malfunctioning systems. One successful 1hr repair would make him 100% or I think a jury-rig could get him semi functional

A couple things: a) *Vital Transfer* (the Force Power that heals) **won't** cure the blindness but it **will** bring you up the Condition Track (if I use a Destiny Point, which I'm cool with - it's my function on the team), b) Even blind people can shoot blasters and throw grenades down a narrow hallway with some hope of success... I think. I guess *mechanically* the blindness is a hefty penalty but maybe some Force Points and/or fancy Persuasion rolls could bluff our way out of a confrontation...? Just spitballin'. I could even try *aiding another* on the grenade throws with *move object*.
I could even float one of the mummies down the hall and try and freak out whoever might be arriving... <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Alright... had to make some edits to my post after discovering there were more I didn't see.
Now's its up and I hope you enjoy.
Also, if you haven't looked at the map on Roll20 yet within the last hour or so, you might want to. It's now been edited for LOS, so you will only see what has been revealed. Feel free to move your tokens around to represent where it is you're going.
In the case of Raven: she hasn't taken the serum yet, or declared to be actively using the force to aid in perceptions. I'll allow 1 UTF check per game minute for the purpose of Sense Surroundings to see. However, when she moves to a new area, a new UTF and Perception check will need to be made for her to notice what is in her surroundings.

And I see what you were talking about Alicia. The map isn't adjusted and matching up with the grid on R20. That is a pain sometimes to get it to line up right.

I believe Jake was referencing the 4 way intersection.
I was earlier in the game trying to get the grid to match but now that dynamic lighting is set up I said screw it and did my best to get the ruler to match up to the measurements. Maybe instead of meters I'll do square lengths

Well after two GM posts with no interaction the game is over.
This would count as one and the one on weds as 2... so not very long.

Eeep. Looking back I realize I made an assumption about the turrets. Are they listed as "offline" meaning they can be turned on, or Offline as in inoperative?

either way it still spices things up a bit

You guys never investigated their status. So I guess you're about to find out. <!-- s:evil: -->![:icon_evil:](https://i.ibb.co/C5wQfzF6/icon-evil.gif)<!-- s:evil: -->

Rolling the dice, literally, digitally and figuratively. Not digging the devil horns though. They bode not so well.

Doesn't BCAD have a blaster for an arm or something anyway? He's basically a turret, right? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
I'm game with whatever. I'll try and get a post up later but no guarantees - it's my ten-year anniversary tonight. My Secret Plans are all over but there's no accounting for *me* being whisked away to somewhere awesome, though I wouldn't argue if she just wanted to play LEGO games on the XBox all night either... <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->
**Edit:** I should totally try and have Tari be a ventriloquist and make the ship/station respond threateningly...

### **Ryder2101** (2014-07-24 19:45:52)

he does, just not as powerful as the rifle he's holding except at point blank range

### **BWS2K** (2014-07-29 10:52:49)

I don't have **Persuasion** as a trained skill so I don't think I can *aid another*, or even try the ventriloquism shtick. <!-- s:/ -->![:/](https://i.ibb.co/1fht9Fjq/icon-mad.gif)<!-- s:/ -->
I confess, though, that I'm at a bit of a loss about what to do. I feel like we're in trouble if Primes' bluff doesn't work and we might be able to muscle on the captain - although we did "trap" the ship by locking the docking clamps, and remember that the station seems to be sentient. I'm still around, so let's figure this out friend-o's!

### **Jake** (2014-07-29 18:21:44)

Yeah, I just had the feeling we were getting marched into a cell before we had a chance to fight it out. (Like if they got that Tech into the cockpit and wrested control of the station from... uh... the nice, station-voice computer-lady.)
Until I realized the security turrets in the bay may or may not be able to activate I figured it was the most strategic place to fight it out.
I think 'aid another' is fine for skills you can use untrained. I know you can't aid another for 'trained only' actions if you are not trained.

### **Jake** (2014-07-29 18:28:56)

I hope we caught the captain at his 'plan' to just delay us until he controls the station and now we'll get the chance to actually meet him and negotiate instead of his goons continuing to arrogantly lead us around. If he's likeable, then we might get passage off the station without a fight. Otherwise we lay waste! And destroy the station as we leave! No evidence!
Although I would want to ask the station more questions before we go. Like it's designation, it's purpose, what time it is. But now isn't the time and I'm figuring my hibernation sickness waiting to recur is a bomb waiting to go off.
(All of this is out of character though and may not be acted on in-game)

Wanted to throw this out there.. I'm going to be rebooting the game on Roll20, so if you would like to reapply or restart with your characters feel free to put up your application. I haven't decided yet if it's going to be another hybrid game, that will be up to the group that gets put together.

Sticking with the Saturday timeslot or more than once a week or it just depends on what folks want?

To explain more: I'm still thinking every other week but the game day/time will be determined by the majority.
