**Posting Guidelines**
* At minimum, players should expect to post 2 or 3 times a week.
* I will try to post every couple days regardless of whether everyone has posted or not. This will keep things moving but will mean that you, as a player will have to catch up on reactions, etc. [list]

[*]Make sure to read ALL posts, not just the ones you believe relevant to you. 
[*]I understand allowances must be made for real life. If you feel that you are unable to hold up the minimum posts, please let me know and some arrangements will be made.
[*]No one-liners, or two-liners. Posts should be, at minimum, about four lines (or a paragraph) long. If you can't think of enough to write I respectfully submit you're not thinking hard enough. How does your character say what they're saying? What expressions do they wear? How do they move? How do they act? This is a roleplaying game, so succeeds or fails based on how well you portray your characters and how well the audience—me, the other players, PCs and NPCs, and anyone reading—come to understand them. Also, by being descriptive you leave less to the audiences imagination of what you're doing and informs them precisely of what you are doing. This will lead to less misunderstandings down the line.
[*]Please, **please** use correct grammar and spelling. We're all adults and went to school. We should be able to write grammatically correct sentences and spell correctly most of the time. Some advice: use a word processor and spell check. (This will also prevent your browser from losing your nice long post.) Then reread aloud to yourself what you wrote. If it doesn't sound right when read aloud it will most likely sound awkward when read by someone else. Reading aloud will also force you to concentrate on the words and catch corrections far easier than just reading it to yourself.
[*]The IC thread is for IC. It sounds obvious I know, but what I mean by this is that out-of-character questions and chatter should be kept to the OOC thread. The only OOC allowed in the IC thread is the breakdown of actions you wish to take during a round, which should be listed after any in-character writing and placed in double parentheses to indentify it. Please don't break up the flow of your narrative by including any OOC in the middle of the text.[/list]
**Character Creation**
* 32 point buy for stats before racial modifiers and ability increases
* Max HP for level
* We will be using a combination of Backgrounds and Destiny. Please see Rule Changes.
* **credits **= max starting of first level + ((level -1) x 2,000); If you take wealth please remember that the credits may not be in just the form of equipment or currency.
* **Books to use** any, I ask when writing out the stat block you make a list somewhere of where the non-core references are coming from. This includes equipment.
* **Races **Era specific. Make sure to look in the Wookiepedia to see if they were actually around your desired time frame. If I see they aren't then the character will be denied.

Also required will be a level breakdown to be included on the sheets (at the bottom of the sheet or in notes section).

```
[b][size=125]Level 1:[/size] class 1;[/b] Str 8, Dex 8, Con 8, Int 8, Wis 8, Cha 8
[list][b]Talents[/b] *
[b]Feats[/b] *
[b]Skills[/b] *
[b]Force Powers Known[/b] *[/list]
```

<summary>Example Level </summary>

Example:
**Level 1:  Jedi 1;** Str 10, Dex 17, Con 10, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 14

* **Talents** Battle Meditation
**Feats** Force Sensitive, Force Training, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Proficiency (lightsaber, simple)
**Skills** Acrobatics, Initiative, Perception, Use the Force
**Force Powers Known** Move Object, Saber Swarm [lightsaber form]

**Level 2: Jedi 2;**

* **Feats **Skill Focus (Use the Force)

**Level 3:   Jedi 3;**

* **Talents **Force Persuasion
**Feats** Force Training
**Force Powers Known** Surge, Force Stun

**Level 4: Jedi 4;** Str 10, Dex 18, Con 10, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 14

* **Feats **Melee Defense
**Force Powers Known** Negate Energy (2)

</details>
This technique may seem like a nuisance but is actually very efficient in making sure you don't miss out on class/level abilities when you level as well as allows the GM (me) a level by level looks of your progress. In the end actually saves time in error checking.

**House Rules**
* Block/Deflect can be used against a critical to take normal damage. The Use the Force check must meet or beat the total attack roll.

[*]Since ammo is not being kept track of, use the following rule instead: When a natural 1 is rolled on an attack roll when using a weapon which contains a power cell or pack, then the weapon has become jammed or shorts out and the power source must be replaced as a move action next round. This also includes any melee weapon, only lightsabers do not need a replacement. Instead it takes two swift actions next round to readjust the power settings and turn it back on.
It is thus assumed that during down time a character has recharged his power pack or energy cell, or replaced a used one.
[*]**Retraining:**(Notify GM when retraining and my be subject to scrutiny; in character reason for Retraining will be needed/requested)
Sometimes you make decisions when you create or advance your character that you later regret. Perhaps a talent you chose isn't working with your character concept, or a feat never comes into play the way you anticipated. 
Every time you gain a level, you can retrain your character: change one feat, talent, or skill selection you made previously. You can make only one change at each level.
* **Feat:** You can replace a feat with another feat. You must meet the prerequisites of the new feat. You can’t replace a feat if it’s a prerequisite for any other attribute you have. If you choose to replace a feat you gained as a class bonus, you must replace it with a feat from the bonus feat list for that class.
* **Talent:** You can replace a talent with another talent from the same class. You must meet any prerequisites for that talent and you can't replace the talent of it is a prerequisite for another attribute.

[*]**Destiny Unleashed** Destiny Points may be spent as normal, but they may also be used to attempt things that the character would otherwise be incapable of or that might not be permissible within the constraints of the rules.
The player states their proposed action, then declares a number of Destiny Points they are willing to stake to make the action happen. They may also suggest one or more serious consequences that the action will have on the character in an attempt to reduce the amount of Destiny Points required.
The GM then either accepts the offer or makes a counter offer which the player can in turn accept or refuse.
If negotiation is successful the action occurs, the agreed amount of Destiny Points are spent, and any consequences agreed on are suffered by the character.
*Example uses of Destiny:*

* Natural 20, or negate a critical hit: 1 Destiny Point
Use an Unleashed ability (FU p35 & 37): 1 Destiny Point, and move 1 persistent step down the Condition Track (this consequence is not suffered by anyone who possesses the Unleashed Feat)
Unique effects: 1 or more Destiny Points, variable consequences.
[/list]

**Rules Changes**:
(These rules will be changed if they become an issue)
* When multiclassing, if going from one class to another that uses the 3/4th BAB scale, you do not have to start over. BAB for such levels is treated as total character levels with 3/4th BAB.
* **Climb, Swim and Jump** now fall under the *Athletics (Str)* skill. Athletics is a class skill for: Jedi, Soldiers, and Scouts
* **Armored Defense and Improved Armored Defense** Soldier talents are now under one talent of *Armored Defense Mastery* and is accessible to Soldiers as normal. The Imperial Knight Talent Armor Mastery is now null.
* **Battle Meditation and Improved Meditation** Jedi talents are combined under the name *Battle Medititation*.
* **Block and Deflect** Jedi talents are now combined into one talent called *Defend*. Take cumulative for each block and deflect action. Talents such as Riposte and Redirect Shot are still taken individually.
* **Riposte** Jedi talent (KotOR p25) - As a reaction once per round instead of once per encounter.
* **Improved Riposte and Improved Redirect** Jedi talents (KotOR p39) - Once per encounter not once per turn
* **Improved Skill Focus** feat - *Prerequisite level 6, Skill Focus in desired skill. Cannot be taken as a bonus feat.* Can be taken multiple times, choosing the skill to be improved in. To symbolize continuing studies in an area of expertise, Improved Skill Focus replaces the bonus from Skill Focus granting either +5 skill bonus or 2 + 1/2 level skill bonus, whichever is higher.
* **Followers** (CW p33) - If these rules become to unbalancing for the game play experience they will be modified.[list]
* **Force Points:** 1 per level (similar to Destiny points) they are not lost when the follower is leveled. They can only be used by the follower.
* **Hit Points:** (10 + con) x heroic level
* **Ability Scores:** Start at 10 as normal and spend an additional 5 points to increase on abilities in addition to the template bonus. A follower will then gain 1 ability increase at levels 4, 8, 12, etc.
* **Talents and Feats**: Followers do no gain talents unless specified by the follower's template or from talents taken by the hero. They do not gain bonus feats from their species, even if they would normally gain one. They go however gain feats as normal at levels 1, 3, 6, etc. All followers gain the Weapon Proficiency (simple weapons) feat.

[*]**Follower Actions** - 
* Followers continue to follow orders rather than constantly require them (For instance, your guards are ordered to combine fire with you, they continue to do so when you attack until ordered to do something else or the target is downed). Also, unless otherwise specified, orders effect all of your followers. Orders can also be allowed to come from other players if the character orders it.

[*]**Backgrounds and Destiny** will be used in combination. While no Destiny template will be chosen, the character will receive 1 Destiny Point for every odd level. Meaning a level 6 character will have 3 Destiny Points. In addition, the player will choose a Background from the Rebellion Era Source book (p16) with the following changes:
* Add all skills from the Background to your Class Skill list
*Origin * backgrounds will gain a Skill Training for one of the Background Skills for free (mark on sheet as a Skill Training with a footnote indicating Background Skill
*Occupation *background's competency bonus may be stacked with Skill Training.
Receive all additional benefits from background as described
[/list]

The Dark Side and Transgressions 
Everyone will be treated the same when it comes to the Dark Side whether you are Force Sensitive or not. 
This check list will be used to determine what transgression category an act falls under: 
Jedi Counseling 111

<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Atonement Ain't Easy
**Q: Atonement seems too easy. It's common to have Force Points left over upon gaining a level. Since they would be lost anyway, couldn't you spend them on atonement, effectively reducing your Dark Side Score for no real cost?**
A: Atonement isn't quite that simple. It requires "a period of meditation, reflection, and absolution" on the part of the character, so it isn't a quick or instantaneous process. First, the player declares that his character is attempting to atone, spending 1 Force Point as a swift action; this represents the character pausing as she realizes that she is walking down the wrong path.
Next, the Gamemaster decides how to adjudicate the attempt to atone, such as how long it will take, whether any special acts of contrition will be required, and so forth. If performed "on stage," it should span at least the length of an adventure (during which the hero is essentially a total saint). If performed between adventures, it will normally require at least a week and possibly as long as months (even years!) of sincere reflection. The precise time and effort required should usually reflect the character's transgressions, so someone with a very high Dark Side Score may have to meet a higher standard to prove that the atonement is sincere. 
The GM also adjudicates when the attempt is successful. If the hero's actions don't reflect a sincere desire to atone, her Dark Side Score won't be reduced. Still, the details are up to the GM, and atonement should never interfere with the needs of the campaign. 
One last detail here: You can atone only 1 point at a time. This means that you can't spend all your leftover Force Points just before you gain a level. You could start a period of atonement, certainly, but it wouldn't end for quite some time (as described above). 
________________________________________
**Q: If you have Force Point Recovery and you atone to reduce your Dark Side Score, do you get the Force Point back? **
A: No. Force Points that you sacrifice for atonement are permanently lost and cannot be recovered by any means. 
________________________________________
**Q: I'm having some problems deciding what type of transgression some actions should be. How can you tell when something is blatantly evil (a major transgression), questionably evil (a moderate transgression), or dubiously evil (a minor transgression)? **
A: While the precise divisions are ultimately up to the GM, enforcing them as loosely or tightly as appropriate for the campaign, here are some guidelines to help you decide on corner cases. To decide if an action is "blatantly evil," ask yourself the following questions: 
•	Did the action harm a sentient, living character?
•	Did the action harm a character that was at your mercy (helpless, unable to meaningfully defend itself, or something similar)? 
•	Did the action cause serious harm to a character (physically, mentally, or emotionally)? 
•	Was the action unnecessary to protect yourself or another character from an immediate, obvious threat? 
•	Was the action deliberate and the result intended? 
If the answer to all of these questions is "Yes," then the action is almost certainly "blatantly evil" (a major transgression) and deserves increasing the character's Dark Side Score. Examples include murder, torture (including acts such as intentional mutilation or maiming), slavery, rape, and any similar act considered reprehensible by most civilizations. 
If exactly one question can be answered "No," then the action is probably "questionably evil" (a moderate transgression), which might be worth increasing the character's Dark Side Score. Examples include assassinating an Imperial warlord who is about to give orders to exterminate the population of a planet (it's in defense of others, but he's still at your mercy), tormenting a droid to extract information, or starting an unnecessary fight that results in serious injury. 
If exactly two of the questions can be answered "No," then the action is probably "dubiously evil" (a minor transgression) and likely doesn't deserve increasing the character's Dark Side Score. Examples include killing in self-defense or recklessly (but accidentally) causing injury to others. 
If three or more questions can be answered "No," then the action probably is not a dark side transgression at all. For example, destroying an object is not a transgression unless doing so also causes some sort of substantial harm to a character. Similarly, hunting an animal (not sentient) in the wilderness (not helpless) for sustenance (protecting yourself from starvation) is perfectly acceptable in all but the most unusual circumstances. 
Obviously, you'll still need to interpret the situation accordingly. How strictly do you want to define "harm"? For example, is a rich character harmed in a significant way by having a minor treasure stolen? Is a threat imminent and real, or is the character merely trying to justify unnecessary aggression? The purpose of these questions isn't to give you a never-fail method but to help you evaluate an action. When in doubt, go with your gut instinct. The more you have to parse and explain an action to make it acceptable, the more likely it is to be a transgression. 
________________________________________
**Q: Would Severing Strike be a major transgression? It seems that you'd never learn this talent unless you intended to maim others. **
A: No, Severing Strike, in itself, is not a transgression because it is designed to protect your target from an otherwise lethal blow. The same would be true for a doctor who has to perform a medical amputation. Although the act is "maiming" in the strictest sense, it is only to protect the target from a more dangerous medical problem. 
This doesn't mean that Severing Strike can't be used in a blatantly evil way, of course. Cutting off the limbs of an enemy who is at your mercy would still be tantamount to torture no matter how you do it (by lightsaber, scalpel, or angry Wookiee). 
________________________________________
**Q: What happens if you use move object against a door? How about Force thrust? **
A: If you use move object against a door, you deal normal damage to it as the door strains against its frame. (Don't forget to apply the effects of the door's damage reduction.) If the damage is sufficient to reduce the door to 0 hit points, it becomes disabled and the door is pulled free, making the doorway passable. 
If you use Force thrust against a door, compare your Use the Force check result to the door's break DC. If successful, you have forced the door open. If not, the door remains intact and functional. 
For those who are interested, an object's break DC is calculated as if it were a character resisting a bantha rush or Force thrust. Take its Strength bonus, add 10 (the average result on a roll of 1d20, rounded down), and -- in most cases -- add 5 more for being exceptionally stable. (Some particularly fragile objects may deviate on this last detail, but that is fairly rare.)

Major Trangressions DSP Guaranteed
**Performing a blatantly evil act** such as deliberately killing or injuring another creature who hasn't done anything wrong or who honestly seeks redemption for evil acts performed in the past. 
**Using a Force Power with the [dark side] descriptor **
**Using the Force in anger **

Moderate Transgressions DSP based on action and at the GM's discretion. 
**Using the Force to cause undue harm **
**Performing a questionably evil act** such as killing (or allowing) a helpless opponent, even if the opponent has committed evil acts without remorse. 

Minor Transgressions These probably will not increase your DSS unless the GM feels there is good reason to make an exception. 
**Performing a dubiously evil act** such as killing an opponent in combat while ignoring opportunities to end the situation without the loss of lige, though a specific situation might not be so clear cut.

Skill Challenges (borrowed from DarthAnthrax)
Skill Challenges are in a way similar to Combat Encounters, but also quite different. All participants will take turns making various actions, just as in combat. However, unlike combat you don´t need to act in Initiative order (unless I say so). Instead, the only rule is that a character cannot act again until all other characters have taken an action. 

The actions you take will primarily consist of using skills, or possibly aiding another on skill checks. However, in order to aid another character in a Skill Challenge, you need to be trained in the skill in question. 

The goal of a skill challenge is to acquire a certain number of successes before acquiring 3 failures. Successes are earned by succeeding on skill checks, but can also be earned by clever application of talents, feats or Force powers. Combat actions can also be allowed, but the purpose is to provide an alternative to normal Combat Encounters. Bottom line, if you think something sounds reasonable try it, and I will tell you if it´s ok. 

Important to remember is also that this is not a substitute for roleplaying. A Skill Challenge is not supposed to be you taking turns saying what skills you want to try, and me resolving them. You are supposed to describe the actions you´re taking, and then just add what ability you want to use. Fortunately, I´ve got some NPCs that can demonstrate if you don´t quite get it. 

Finally, sometimes the Challenge will have certain special effects working, in which case I will tell you only if they would create a new opportunity for you. For example, one effect allows you to trade one recently earned success for removing a failure, while another one makes you earn a failure only if you fail by 5 or more. In the first case I would tell you that the effect is in play, but not in the second case.
