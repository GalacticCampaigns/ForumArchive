*There has been one undeniable truth since the beginning of time: Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. While the names change; players, events and places alike, history has continually repeated itself.
In ancient times the Celestials ruled the galaxy, spreading their technological advances to the races they enslaved. The Rakata tiring of their master’s whip, overthrew the Celestials, running them out of the galaxy, and brought their own order. When disease weakened the Rakata, their own downfall was imminent. Those once considered slaves rallied together, defeating their oppressors and formed the first Galactic Republic. Their borders never delving further than the Unknown Regions.
Since its founding the Republic has been threatened by the might of the Sith and their allies, the democratic peace thwarted by the tyrannical order. Sentients rising up once again to bring the galaxy to an age of peace.
The cycle repeats, and history is written to suit each new order. The castaway history forgotten to time, their stories lost. The truths learned from the lessons of history, forgotten.
If the other side could tell their story, new truths could be discovered. A new history could be written. Things once forgotten would be remembered….*

**Raven**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Raven couldn’t remember the last time she had felt so tired and her limbs heavy from inactivity. The air around her is thin and musty. The sounds of a generator elsewhere coming to life and the sounds of her own breathing dominate the young woman’s existence.
When Raven tries to open her eyes, she finds only blackness. Whether it’s because the room itself is pitch black or there’s something wrong with her vision she doesn’t know. Feeling around she finds she’s enclosed in some sort of tube. While her muscles ache almost painfully she discovers one more thing: her gear is missing.

</details>

**Tari**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Floating. If Tari could sense anything of his surroundings it was the absence of anything containing him. This fact alone is strange enough for the Shard who had lived most of his sentient existence contained within the confines of a droid host. Now however, there was nothing. Not even the presence of the Shard hives to keep him company.
Something was changing, his thoughts were becoming clearer, rather than the dream filled state he’d been in for… how long? Through the Force he can sense the presence of two other lifeforms, their signs faint but growing stronger.

</details>

**BCAD-344**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

A surge of power, and then another brings the dilapidated combat droid to life. Nestled into an alcove deep enough to see nothing else other than the other wall, BCAD is hooked up to a panel of some sort. Another pulse, like a defibrillator, sends more power into the droids reserves.
The pulses seem to have been precisely calculated to bring him to full power quickly without damaging his battery. However, as BCAD runs a diagnostics of his other systems he finds himself woefully damaged and a portion of his memory banks damaged.

</details>

**Primes**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Primes’ haggard breathing is the first thing he hears as he wakes. In the distance the gentle thrumming of a generator draws his attention. As his eyes blink open he finds his vision is pitch black. However it’s hard for him to tell whether this is because there’s something wrong with his eyes or it’s dark he can’t tell.
Relying on touch, Primes reaches around feeling the rounded wall of an enclosure; a tube of some sort. Drawing breaths he quickly realizes the circulated air from his armor has been replaced by stale, musty air. The fact he’s been stripped of his armor is confirmed by more aching movements, discovering he’s been left in the undersuit. Signs of any of his other equipment is also lacking.

</details>

**For Everyone**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Welcome to the Forgotten Ones! You will awaken to find your gear is missing and our human heroes are suffering from the unfortunate side effect of hibernation sickness. Because of this, Raven and Primes will suffer a persistent -2 on the CT until treated and a -10 total on Perception checks when it comes to vision (won’t be counting the penalty from CT).
BCAD is suffering the -4 on CT as per our earlier discussions until someone begins repairs.
Players may reply to their respective opening statement once their sheet has been approved and submitted to the Cast List. Happy posting!

His first thoughts as the diagnostics complete is where he is and how he got there. The limited field of view and his heavily damaged systems create a new sensation he is not sure to how to describe, but the closest description he can determine would be fear or anxiety. *'Odd. Perplexing. This is not correct. Programming malfunction. Where am I. How did I get here? Who repaired my power core?'* Unsure how to cope with the emotion overriding his logic circuits he lurches forward, his mobility control evidently still well out of calibration.
With what would appear as drunkenness he fumbles with the charging cables connected to him attempting to free himself and steps away from the alcove to get a better sense of his surroundings, his actuators whining in protest as his internal gyro attempts to recalibrate to balance himself. **”Hello? BCAD-344 report-t-t-t-ting."**

Pain. Shock. Trauma. *Death*.
For a Shard like Tari, these things meant something very different from the biological implications usually associated with them. To begin with, he wasn't made of flesh and bone. His crystalline form could only experience the galaxy at large by being installed in a droid shell. As an Iron Knight, a sect of Force-sensitive Shard raised under the tutelage of ex-Jedi Master Aquinos, Tari was capable of using his mechanical body in amazing ways - but he was still susceptible to damage. His talents were in the healing aspects of the Force and it was no difficult task to recover from even serious battle damage, or to aid his kin in similar condition, but having been ambushed and forcibly *ripped* from his surrogate body very nearly killed him. As it was, he had actually been shattered, losing a small portion of his fragile Shard crystal in the process. The debris fields of Raxus Prime were somewhat familiar to Tari, serving as his home-in-exile for the several decades, but the primitive junk droids that roamed the wilds there were not always benevolent. It was really only a matter of time before he was caught unawares. His last memories before everything went dark were of watching his droid companions being smashed to pieces. After that, Tari drifted into oblivion.
Time passed.
To say he dreamed would be a stretch; that was just another biological function that took on a very different meaning for a Shard. Still, *something* happened to Tari whereby he experienced a sense of weightless drifting. He was literally *senseless*. Even the century or so on Orax, his homeworld, had been spent in the company of others like him all clustered together on the natural rock formations there. Like something between falling and flying, it lasted for an indeterminate amount of time and was only punctuated by occasional flickers in the Force. There was no clarity, only impressions of... something.
Eventually things do seem to clear up though, the sensations all fading into the background of more immediate awareness. Tari could detect two living beings nearby. There was something else too, something familiar but unexpected... out of place. It takes a few moments for Tari to come fully conscious and realize what it was: he had a mouth. A vocabulator of sorts actually, his latent Force abilities having been hard at work for self-preservation. The bits of his mechanical housing that had been torn out with his Shard body had been remade into a small voicebox. It looked like little more than a metal band wrapped around the his lower half, but it would do for now. Tentatively, cautiously, he sends the electromagnetic pulses through its conduits and makes an attempt to speak:
"**H-hello?,**" the monotone words come into being shakily, "**Is anyone else here?**"
Just in case, and because he needs more information about his surroundings, Tari reaches out with the Force and tries to get an impression of his vicinity...

Raven blinked for a moment as she was in disbelief what was happening. Was she captured by bounty hunters who were hoping claim her for prize money thought Raven as placed her hands on the tube. Raven than quickly reached to her side hoping to break free using her father’s lightsaber, but not finding it by her side was no surprise to find it missing. Raven had hoped that they overlook her weapon, as this was the first time she was without her father’s Lightsaber at side whom she has perfected in concealing.
However what shocked her more was there were more voices in the room that seemed to be in the same situation as her. Raven was about to call out but hesitated in doing so as she did not know who these people were. Instead Raven first closes her eyes trying to search out those who are in touch with the white current also known as force sensitive on a hunch that the others around her were in fact Jedi.
**“Ummm no…”** Raven responded to Tari’s question if anyone else was here in a somewhat joking manner. **"I take it I'm not the only one trapped here"** Raven responded back

Primes struggled to remember recent events. Even though his mind was slow his hands seemed really busy, checking for his weapons, noticing his lack of armor, and even making a futile attempt to remove whatever was over his eyes. (There's nothing over my eyes. I'm blind or it's dark.)
He hit his elbow on the wall of the tube when it back to his side causing a low resonation and a little pain. Primes suddenly remembered the pain he was in before he passed out. A green beam, a lightsaber, piercing his side. (I'm dead, I must be dead.) His hand went to his torso and felt scar tissue. **Ghosts don't get scars.** He said, quietly. He heard voices, but not what they were saying. **I'm not dead!** He pressed on the walls surrounding him. **Let me out!** He started lashing out against the tube imprisoning him.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Not 100% on the CT esp. persistent conditions, but I think it said methods other than the recover action were kosher. So Primes would Shake it Off for 2 swf. (likely keeping the blindness until I get treated) and then lash out with an unarmed strike or a strength check.

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Stumbling forward, BCAD gets a clear view of his surrounds even with the dim emergency lighting. He finds himself in a narrow room, his alcove surrounded on either side by tube like chambers. There’s four total in this room, with his alcove and another he can’t see into breaking up the placement of the chambers. 344 surmises there might have once been six of these chambers here, or perhaps they had never been installed in the first place.The outer shell of the containers are made of metal, with a window at the top to reveal to occupant. Currently two appear to be lit from the inside, and from the muted sounds coming from within they are certainly occupied.
Moving further down into the hall 344 spots a red crystal the size of his fist in the recess of the final alcove hovering over a pedestal. The soft glow of a shield of some sort keeps the crystal confined within, or is it keeping something out?
There’s a door to the left of 344’s alcove, however it is currently closed.

</details>

**Tari**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The Force presents the Shard with a hazy view of his surroundings, the shapes of the mechanisms themselves black blobs. However, he can see the life force of the two living beings sharing his room, and the Force flowing through the metal chassis of a droid.
He can sense their shared confusion and the near hysteria of one. And then he can sense one of them reaching out tentatively in the Force, searching for another Force user. Masking his presence is easy enough for the Shard from his long practice hiding from anyone who may not understand his nature.

</details>

**Primes**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The wall of the chamber is an easy target for Primes. Even in his vulnerable state his fists make contact. The result is a painful jab up his arms as his unprotected fists meets the hard metal, and a ringing in his ears as the sound reverberates in the chamber. The chamber itself is unrelenting as it refuses to open. As is senses adjust he realizes the bed he’s laying on is angled slightly. Not enough at first for him to notice that he’s not laying flat as the platform has been indented to support him.

</details>

**Raven**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Reaching out with the Force, Raven finds… nothing. If there are other Force users in her area, it’s nothing she can detect. From not so far away she can hear the muted pounding and curses from what she can guess is from another trapped sentient. Adjusting more to her surroundings, she realizes the surface has been contoured with her shape, supporting her weight and preventing her from shifting about. This realization also draws her attention to the fact she’s laying at an angle.

**Everyone**

Assume you can hear each other talking, however those in the chambers it will be muffled (Primes with his pounding may not hear it all).

### **Jake** (2014-04-08 19:00:21)

Primes stopped pounding, not because of the pain, but due to the obvious futility. He stifled the ringing of his tube with his forearms and then began frantically feeling in front of himself for a panel or handle, the table he was on, even contorting as much as he was able to check down by his feet. He also tried to slow his panicked breathing, so as try and confirm if he was hearing voices or not. (If this was a Republic hospital, I'm sure an orderly would've come as soon as I began struggling.) He thought to himself. (Maybe I'm in that Seperatist orbital station, the one with the experimentation.)
It took almost no time to feel everything he could reach so Primes straightened up on the table and tried to look straight ahead with a stony glare. (I just won't say anything, they've prolly had their jollies just watching me struggle, the bastards.)
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

If there's anything of interest I can feel, I don't expect it to take a skill check, but if anyone speaks, I make a Perception check to discern as much as I can about the person speaking.

*An interesting mix of neighbors*, thinks Tari, *I do hope one of us finds the doorknob…*
The sarcasm somes almost unbidden into his thoughts - he was not known for dark humor. At least, he hadn't ever really tried it. Maybe now was the time to start?
"**Yes, well, now that we've all *introduced* ourselves, perhaps someone can manage to break free? I would, but my distinct lack of appendages prevents me from doing little more than make enlightened suggestions.**"
*Curious… I think I should be dead.*
Those thoughts, too, stir up odd emotions in the bodiless Shard. As more awareness of the present comes into focus, so do memories of the past. Tari's most recent memories are of being attacked and left for dead on Raxus Prime... had he been rescued? Captured? Perhaps his companions held the key.
*Figuratively, of course.*

### **Ryder2101** (2014-04-09 13:00:27)

As 344 stabilizes outside of the alcove he takes in his immediate surroundings. Muffled pounding from the cylindrical pod to his left draws him closer, curiosity pushing him to inspect the container.
**Scanning** Design...unfamiliar...intended use probability...80% chance hibernation chamber.
*'Is the occupant a prisoner or passenger or something else?'* He steps closer and looks through the viewport, the interior lighting revealing the human form of Primes stoically staring out, seemingly unaware of 344 looking in on him.
***Error…Memory Leak** 344 stands frozen looking down on the human crumpled at his feet. He had been awakened with minimal power and repairs and opened fire immediately. He didn't understand why his programing was conflicted with the outcome. He was programmed to keep the slaves in line and punish any who attempted unauthorized maintenance, yet here he was unable to move, his pulse-wave rifle still smouldering slightly as it cooled from the repeated close range auto-fire. Was there corruption in his data? He needed repairs and he may have just removed the chance he had to get fully operational again.
**Memory Bank Resequenced***
He stepped back stunned from the memory flash, feeling anxious and slightly panicked. He took a moment to began looking for the release to open the pod when he heard another synthetic voice and immediately turned and headed to search it out. Passing the other occupied pod he turned to look into the alcove and sees the crystal floating behind an energy shield. *'A crystal? Is this what I heard? Is that possible?'* He stepped closer and inspected the alcove with more scrutiny. He could see the crystal was chipped and a small monofilament was wrapped partially around it. *'Is it living or mechanical?'*
Deciding the crystal may have more immediate useful information to the situation 344 decided to attempt communication and release of it first. **”Are you living or mechanical. Can you hear me? Can you see? Do you know where we are?"** The questions flow from 344 in rapid succession in his male timbered mechanical voice, a hint of excitement accentuating each question. As he asked the questions 344 looked for a way to shutoff the energy field and began contemplating just reaching through and grabbing the crystal and pulling it out manually.

Raven started to rub her eyes in hopes she could remove whatever was blocking her vision but to no avail. Unable to rub out the blindness, Raven focused on hearing what was happening around her looking for any clues as to where she is and let alone why she was here. *‘So whoever is catching us doesn’t care much if we’re living, let alone in touch with the White Current’* thought Raven as she heard mixture of both mechanical and organic voices outside the tubes.
**“Since we’re not going anywhere, mind if try figure out why we are here? There has to be something in common with all of us. Any of you guys participated in the Mandalorian War by any chance, if not Jedi Civil War?”** yelled Raven so she be more easily heard through the muffling sound barrier of the tubes. The tone of Raven's voice seem to be a mixture of uneasiness, curiosity and a hint of annoyance as she didn't know why she and everyone else was awaken from these hibernation tubes. Were they captured prisoners? Were they patients recovering from some injury or illness that Raven has forgotten about due to the treatment? The suspense was both killing her and annoyed her. Surely whoever was in charge wouldn’t leave them waiting long.
Raven than quickly closed her eyes as tried to calm her mind in perpetration of sensing her surroundings not through her eyes, but by the White Current.

Primes strained his ears to hear a muffled female voice. And sat quiet for a minute while he parsed the full meaning of the question. (In common?)
(She's crazy, but at least she sounds organic) **Ha ha ha.** Primes said sardonically. **Sorry, Granny, but I'm a little bit too young to have served in the Mandolorian Wars**. He paused and mulled it over for a bit. **I'm just blind!** He said speaking loudly to any orderlies who might be listening. **Not crazy. You guys low on room in the hospital or something?**
Primes felt a bit more at ease, and relaxed on his table to wait for the inevitable doctor or medical droid to make the rounds and see he was awake.

### **Alicia** (2014-04-10 21:52:24)

While Raven’s earlier attempts to use the Force to detect other Force users had failed her, she is able to get a brief grasp of what’s around her. Like a brief look at a holo image she can see a droid standing to her right, sense the presence of another living being off to her left and something else not quite alive, but radiant in the Force in front of the droid.
From his enclosure, Primes unfortunately doesn't learn much other than two of the voices sound mechanical and the other is female. It doesn't help, either, his ears are still ringing from his attempt to break out of the chamber with brute force. Contorting about in his tube seems just as futile as his earlier attempt at force as he finds no signs of a release from within.
As 344 fumbles about the control panel on the pedestal over which the crystal hovers, there’s an audible hiss as the air inside the chambers and the room mix. The air is definitely fresher than the stale, musty air within the chambers and the two humans take in gasping breaths. The doors on the chambers lift up from the bottom and slide partially into the top of the unit leaving the occupants plenty of room to step out. The ‘bed’ Primes and Raven rest on angles slowly into a better standing position, aiding the two as they slowly slide to rest on their feet.
On either side of the room, the previously dormant chambers power on and the doors open revealing a macabre sight of mummified remains. Apparently, they hadn't been as lucky.
Having found the controls, 344 is able to deactivate the shield surrounding the crystal, however it continues to hover in place. On closer inspection the Shard has managed to attach itself to what looks like a vocabulator and a small power cell. Scrapped remnants of something much larger: a droid? He seems to be clutching to the parts with the filaments like a life line allowing him to communicate using the vocabulator.
“***Resuscitation complete.***” A mechanically female voice announces over the intercom. ***Proximity Alert: Foreign incursion impending.*** ”

*(This isn't the first time Seps have hit one of our hospital stations, but usually there's at least a technician for evacuation. Maybe we're not priority patients?)* Primes shook that thought out of his head angrily as he slid to the ground. *(Think like that and you're already dead.)*
**So what's the evacuation plan?** Primes yells to the intercom. He was obviously frustrated but really was hoping for an answer. He straightens his undersuit with his hands and turns towards where he heard the voices. **How many people do we have in this wing anyway? Sound off!**
*(Just got to keep things under control, don't want any of these patients getting out of hand while this place is evacuating. Especially the crazies)* Primes crosses his arms expectantly. **Well?**

### **Ryder2101** (2014-04-11 20:27:57)

As 344 finally released the shielding around the Shard he responded to Raven's muffled question. **"My memory has no record of either conflict you speak of or any reference to who the *Jee'dai* are."** He attempts to mimic the phrase 'Jedi' as she had said it, a term he had never heard before. **"Are they another slave species of the Infinite Empire?"**
His thoughts and actions are interrupted as the atmosphere in the compartment changes with the hiss of air mixing as the pods open and a feminine synthetic voice emits over the internal communication system. *'So we are on a ship but what is the purpose? Unknown design, hibernation chambers. Occupant of one has knowledge of events after my shut down, the other speaks of it as if not during his generation. How long have I been powered down?"*
**Chronometer Error…Synchronization Required
Error…Memory Leak…'*incursion impending*'…**
*344 pushed aside a chunk of duracrete that had fallen from the ceiling during the last attack. **"Commander D'laang?"** he called out as he surveyed the damage to himself and the contents of the room, quickly finding what appeared to be the feet of his Rakata master, and the only one in the room, sticking out from a larger slab of the ceiling in pieces on the floor only a few meters from him. Grabbing the datapad from the crushed table in front of him he began making his way out of the crumbling dust filled room while opening an encrypted channel to the Infinite Empire forces in the city. **"Sector 26 is compromised, move to secondary positions. All sectors Fire at Will, no prisoners, no survivors. Prepare for bombardment of sectors 20 through 29."** He knew the order would be a massacre to the unarmed slaves in the city but control could not be lost to a few rebellious groups. Reinforcements would arrive soon, they just needed to hold at all costs. The city could be rebuilt and the bombardment would be a demoralizing blow and turn the battles back into the Empire's favor.*
**Memory Resequenced**
344 found himself in a low battle ready stance, his concealed mounted pulse rifle primed and at the high ready, though aimed at nothing in particular. *'Another memory error. How much time passed? Seconds? Minutes? Chronometer is malfunctioning, unknown.'* Confused but understanding the possible danger he leaves his weapon engaged and at the low ready while responding to Primes' question.
**"There are 3 sentients in this compartment plus myself. The other hibernation pods contain the mummified remains of their occupants. I am Battlefield Combat Analysis Droid, unit 344 or BCAD for short. You both appear functional, are you?”**

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-11 21:24:11)

"**I am called Tari,**" drones the Shard, "**And I'm currently having a, um, out of body experience of sorts. I may be of more use if someone could manage to find a computer terminal…?**"
It's a longshot, but Tari may be able to glean some information from whatever passes for memory banks aboard the ship.
*Just how **did** we all get here - and where **are** we? We need some answers…*
The red crystal body begins to pulse with a dim glow as Tari once more reaches out in the Force and tries to find a station he can work at with his Force abilities, which include accessing digitally-stored data.

**Use the Force** to *Sense Surroundings* again, this time with a specific goal of finding a place for Tari to use his *Technometry* power. I imagine his own control panel might even do the trick, but this isn't freeform. I'll sustain the *Sense Surroundings* roll too, if that's alright, so I can see things like Neo. ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

**“I’m not a granny, aside for my callsign people called me kid in the Republic military. As for where we are, hell if I know”** said Raven just before the pod doors opened.
With the openings of the pods and leveling off for Raven for Raven to step off, Raven decides to feel the edges of the pods before moving her hands in front of her to make sure nothing was in the way. Once Raven had determined it was safe to step off the pod, she slowly shuffled her feet so she could walk off the pod and make sure she wouldn’t trip over anything.
**“Well I’m resigned Captain for Republic Air Wing, I flew drop ships for Space or Air Assaults.”** Said Raven replying towards Primes.
Raven sighed as the Droid seemed to believe this Infinite Empire still existed. **“Well, the Jedi like myself weren’t slaves. Although I do think all the Jedi are dead”** Raven replied. However once the Droid continued talking Raven slowly reached behind her to feel the pod so she can make her away around the pod to take cover incase the Droid began firing at everyone.
**“Just remember the keepers of this facility seem to want us to live, so if Infinite Empire runs this place they would want us to live. And you don’t want to upset them do you?”** said Raven hoping to convince whatever programing the droid still have would not continue to malfunction and fire upon her.

Lowering his weapon arm more as he turned towards Raven he stood straighter, his servos whining in protest, and spoke with an even monotone. **"I do not believe this to be an Infinite Empire facility. The technology is not entirely familiar nor the design layout. Additionally, if it was I would have received more than base line repairs."** 344 pauses a moment before continuing, obviously processing more data, **"With the evidence at hand,"** he gestures with his damaged arm towards the other open pods and the mummified remains of the unknown organics, **"and the lack of personnel present when we all were awak-k-k-kened coupled with the quality of air in this chamber I would state with 90% certaint-t-t-ty that this facility, be it in space or planet side is automated or has been unmanned for a number of years."**
He then turns to face Tari, still floating above the pedestal. **"This chamber is mostly bare. I suggest we move to another location, possibly locating any equipment we can use."** He then turns back to the two Humans. **"A soldier and a resigned Captain of the *Republic*. I am conflicted who to take orders from. BCAD-344 report-t-t-ting for duty. Systems operating at 70% functionality."** He bows slightly in front of them, his servos whining slightly as he moves.

Tari hears the conversation as if at a distance - the bulk of his energies being spent reaching out through the Force. Even his own thoughts form slowly:
*That… doesn't explain… much,* he thinks, *Even with… two dead… this is… clearly more… than a… chance meeting…*
The stasis pods didn't open by themselves however, and the automated voice had a source. There's still a working computer system somewhere...

As if on cue, the door BCAD spotted upon leaving his alcove open with a “whoosh”. The room beyond is lit dimly, but brighter than the low ambience which greeted the group upon awakening.
Moving into the room, it’s smaller with another door, a blast door this time, directly in front.
On the left wall is a row of storage lockers, a panel on the right of each locker and is set with a dusty, unlit display above the panel.
To the right of the door is a desk with a thick layer of desk obscuring the controls beneath. A large display above it shows six views and matching readouts. The latter of which has red text in basic overlaying the readouts indicating the resuscitation process had completed.
As each person enters the room the displays next a lockers light up, except for the one next to both of the doors. Cleaning off the display reveals the name and an image of each of you , and the lockers are set up in the same order as the previous room.

Spotting the console immediately, Tari tries to make it across the room. He gently lifts himself up with the Force and slowly begins to drift freely through the doors. It's awkward, trying to maintain his awareness of the environment around him while levitating his body at the same time, weaving over and around the others, but he does manage to eventually set down on the dusty terminal.
*And now for some answers…*
Now in full contact with the computer station, Tari begins to search through its databanks to determine just exactly what's going on.
"**BCAD-344,**" he adds, "**You seem to be the only one with unimpaired vision at the moment. Perhaps you could help the others over here. I believe you may find something useful in these lockers, although it might be more skeletons, so be careful.**" The bad attempt at humor is likely lost among the gravity of the situation and his second-rate voice box.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Use the Force** to use *Technometry* (p.52, CW) on the computer console. Tari's looking for the following information, if it's necessary to state: *What* is the nature of the incursion (time left, where is it safe, etc.), *when* and *where* are we, and *who* are/were the mummies. The nearest location of a medpac might be useful too... However you want to tackle that.

344 watches as the Shard rises from the pedestal slowly and floats through the door that just opened in both confusion and amazement. He had seem similar unexplainable feats performed by his Rakata masters, though usually it was in a form that caused pain or trauma to organics or the occasional droid being tossed across a room. Hearing Tari's monotone instruction as he floated past he nodded, an odd movement for him since his *head* was mostly built into the upper portion of his *chest*, then turned to assist both the Humans into the room. He paused as he entered the room to get his bearings and spotted the lockers and could faintly see the view screen for each with an image obscured by dust. Even with his impaired systems he was able to extrapolate enough of each image before approaching the locker to guide Primes and Raven to theirs before going and attempting to open his.
Standing in front of the locker with his image he reached up and wiped away the dust on the screen then reached down and pulled on the handle to open the locker. He wondered if his missing equipment was located inside or if it contained something else to confound his logic circuits.

### **Alicia** (2014-04-14 10:26:11)

Tari touches lightly down on the computer console with a barely audible thud. As he tries to get some information out of the console it comes to life almost immediately. There’s something there, he notices, preventing him from accessing the complete system and most of the information he wants slips out of his grasp before he can fully recognize it. He does get an answer to one of his questions as the visual on the wall display changes to a map of the ship. From a look at the computer panel, there’s options to view various security feeds from all over the ship.
The locker consoles require identity verification from their respective owners. For Tari, there’s a small slot that his crystalline structure would fit in. BCAD’s has a wired link which would connect to his systems. Primes, Raven, and the remaining two apparently requires a blood sample (the console has a small place where their thumb would be pressed and it would take the sample, much like a finger print scanner).

Raven gulped as Tari suggested 344 to lead both Primes and her to the locker. *I hope that droid doesn’t get it into his head to off us.* Thought Raven as 344 approached her to lead her to the locker room area. *I wonder what creature who was speaking with a vocabulator, what kind of creature is she.* Raven thought as she was led by the 344 Droid.
Once 344 has finished leading to what Raven assumed was her locker with her equipment, Raven began to feel around on some way to open the locker. Raven would also accept any help in aiding to open the locker if need be. Once Raven found she opened the locker, she began to search for her stuff making careful care to locate her father’s lightsaber. Once she located her heirloom, Raven decided the best course of action was to conceal the lightsaber like she did before.

Primes listened as the room and lockers were described to him. **This definitely isn't a Republic hospital station.** He said after some thought. **They wouldn't use a biosecurity lock, because I know a lot of soldiers who could open this locker.** His thoughts darkened as he realized that everything was now an unknown.
He opened the locker and set about securing his gear. (I never thought that field stripping my weapons with a blindfold on would ever be this useful.) He does a functions check on each of his weapons as he removes them checking to make sure they are still working and loaded.
**We're going to have to work together to get out of here, but after that I need to get back to the Republic. I have to tell them what happened to my team members.**
*What I really hope is that someone in the Republic can tell me why my team members started killing each other. It has to be a conspiracy.*
**If we are on a ship we need to know what going on outside. If we're near an inhabited system we might be able to contact some help.**

If we have the time, I put on my armor and all my equipment. Otherwise I rig most of my equipment for carrying and have my grenade bandolier and rifle with underslung grenade launcher available for me to draw. If possible I take extra time to ensure I know which kind of grenades are which.

Tari switches through the external feeds in hopes of finding more information about the incursion mentioned by the ship's computer earlier, and, if it's safe, tries to open the blast doors just ahead. Spotting the medical area, he hopes to unlock that hatch as well.
"**The Medical Bay isn't too far away - just through these doors and to the right. I'll try and unlock the path there momentarily. Keep on *not* bumping into things, you're doing *really* well so far!**"
The Shard works as fast as he can before lifting himself up and attempting to open his personalized locker. Whether the path ahead was cleared or not, he doesn't want to waste too much time interfacing with the computer. The added weight of his second-rate cybernetics makes things difficult but not impossible and he drifts slowly across the passage once more. He slips into the lock and hopes to find something he can use to get around in.
*Floating around probably isn't exactly the best idea right now, though thankfully no one but a damaged droid has seen me…*
Tari recalls his day with the Paladins - the combat medics of the Iron Knights. If he had one talent, it was healing... and it looked as if he'd have his chance to shine soon enough.
"**Your words ring true, Clone, if not a little misplaced,**" the Shard manages with a muffled voice from within the customized socket,"**Chronologically-speaking anyway.**"

That's a lot in a post time-wise, so if I'm attempting too much, that's alright - I can split it up.

As 344 inventories the equipment in his locker he listens to the statements of the unlikely group around him. *'Hibernation pods. Mummified remains. Unknown government,* Republic. Jee'dai*, unknown species? Organization? Unknown time lapse.* He obviously determined he was no longer when he remembered, but when is now? **"Tari, where you able d-d-determine the current d-d-date when you accessed the comput-t-t-ter?**
He changed his focus to the security feeds still up on the screen as they continued cycling, watching for any signs of other occupants on the ship as he performed a series of functions checks on his heavy blaster rifle. He extrapolated and committed to his memory the layout of the ship and the contents of each room the security feeds provided and attempted a tactical analysis¹ of their present location and possible paths the *impending intrusion* would or could take. The need for more options and possible equipment came to mind and he turned to face the nearest unopened locker, the unlucky owner no longer requiring the contents he decided to attempt to open it².

"**Sadly,**" comes Tari's voice from the locker socket, "**I was not. Unless we have traveled *backward* in time, BCAD-344, I can say with certainty that we are thousands of years ahead of your last memories - although I imagine some hyperspace accident or other temporal-spatial anomaly could have hurtled us into the past as well as the future.**"
*Hey… that sounds like I know what I'm talking about…*
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I think I'll be making a **Knowledge(galactic lore)** check soon, once Tari gathers a little more information, to see who might have done this to us (who has this tech, etc.). Also - how do characters measure time *within* the SW universe? I remember reading, and I agree with this, that it's odd to measure time from an event in the future. No one who was born a hundred years before the Battle of Yavin would have written *95 BBY* on his First Grade homework papers, right?

### **Alicia** (2014-04-15 13:20:19)

Tari flips easily through the various video feeds for the ship, most of them dark using only the infrared spectrum to show the visuals with any accuracy. One noticeable thing is how empty the ship is. While every part of the ship has a feed to, there’s no sign of anyone controlling the processes of this ship. A quick look into what is a droid storage bay shows a line of broken astromechs which must have worked to keep the ship operational. At least for a time.
Finally, Tari finds what he’s looking for as the external feed reaches the external dock. From the different angles of the feed, Tari can see the easily recognizable YT-1300 coming in to dock. A timer appears below the live image, giving a countdown of ten minutes.
After the locker control panels confirm the owner’s identity (a sharp prick of Prime’s and Raven’s fingers drawing several drops of blood), the locker door opens smoothly and the contents are revealed. When the locker door opens a rack extends out and the contents fold out. Sorted and laid out with great care in their own foam-like slots, each piece of equipment is accounted for and in pristine condition. In place of any sort of credit chip is a small bag of smooth gems.
Feeling around Primes finds his armor held up by some sort of mannequin and has been repaired from his last battle. Grabbing each piece of equipment in turn, he’s pleased to discover it’s been kept in good working order and after finding a power pack finds it’s fully charged. After everything is in place, he notices there’s something extra in his locker. A long cylindrical object, which after a moment of confusion, he realizes is a lightsaber hilt. The weight feels odd in his hand, but it’s clear that whoever set aside his equipment wanted him to have it.
Raven has no problem finding her father’s lightsaber, her hand immediately going to the familiar, and sentimental weapon. Added to her equipment is a round band of some sort. A perfect size to put on her head allowing it to rest on level with her forehead. It almost reminds her of the aural amplifiers she had seen used during the war. It’s true purpose, however, is unknown, at least until she decides to put it on.
BCAD-344 is greeted with an assortment of parts kept in a bin at the top of the locker, enough for him to at least get back to normal operations but not enough to repair his more specialized systems. All his loose equipment has also been replaced with what he can only assume are more modern versions of what he carried with him.
Tari’s rack folds out revealing the chassis for a BLX labor droid. As if in preparation a spot has been made within the internal storage compartment providing the Shard a more protected place to merge with his droid host. Added to the chassis is a utility belt with a few spare med pacs to fill up the remaining slots.
As the last of the lockers is opened, the blast door leading into the hallway opens.

### **Akisa** (2014-04-15 16:51:46)

Raven quickly hid away her lightsaber when she gets the feeling no one was looking in hopes no one could claim she is a Jedi or even a White current Adept. *’I don’t know how people perceive white current adepts, are they treated like Jedi much like the Sith who are nothing alike. Would they think I’m a Jedi? Well I guess I did have Jedi training from Pops, and the Jedi in Mandolorian wars’.* Thought Raven as she put on her gear the best she can, almost like she was getting dressed in the dark in a manner of speaking.
**“So this is new, I don’t remember having anything like this”** said Raven holding out to show what she thought was an aural amplifier, somewhat forgetting she wasn’t the only blinded. **“Maybe while we’re still blind I can hear someone coming or at least tell how far someone is standing”** Raven added. **“Perhaps, shouldn’t try it until I can see better”** Raven continued as she tucked the device away.

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-15 21:55:37)

*Finally!*
Tari's final efforts move him delicately into the customized droid shell and he begins to power up the systems. Like a combination of being born again and coming home, the experience of putting on a new body is a mix of the familiar and the unknown. It will take some time to get used to - it always does - but the model seems simple enough. No specialized systems to speak of.
*Not yet anyway…*
It was a far cry from the chassis he'd had on Raxus, or even the one Tari had used in the Paladins. Some internal storage, bulky armor (*That will take some getting used to…*), magnetic pads - always handy for spacewalks or crash landings. He lurches forward awkwardly, catching himself on the locker hatch to prevent falling to the deck. He stands slowly, testing his joints and flexing his hands once or twice each. Tari swivels his head from side to side, taking in the passageway in full-spectrum color. Sensing a place through the Force was one thing - seeing it with your own eyes was another. The optics blinked as final adjustments took place.
"***Ahhh…!***" As close to a sigh as any machine could manage, the expression warbles through several audio bands before settling in a lower register: "**I suggest we all grab our gear and head to the medical bay down the hall,**" the bass voice rumbles through his vocabulator, "**It's not far at all and we may find something there to help restore your sight. I seem to have some medpacs as well, and a toolkit. I don't know how much we can hope to accomplish in ten minutes,**" Tari checks the display again, "**But we probably shouldn't stay here. The security feed shows a ship making docking maneuvers with our large and rather empty station.**"
Tari steps towards both Raven and Primes, ready to help guide them down the hall when they're ready, even as his recollections of Raxus Prime begin to flood back. While he's no frontline soldier, Tari *does* have some experience in combat and in small unit leadership. He may have to take point until Primes is in better condition, or even BCAD-344.
*Of course, the woman might even be a better choice than me but they've all got to have a chance to recover. That's something I can **definitely** help with…*

### **Jake** (2014-04-16 00:27:46)

Primes nearly drops the lightsaber out of surprise. (*This has to be some kind of mix-up. Unless…*) Primes memory flashes back to the last things he can remember, being stabbed, being told quietly to make his peace before the explosion. (*I'd recognize the hilt on that saber anywhere.*) He thought, while putting his hand absentmindedly over where his scar was covered by his inexplicably repaired armor. He puts the hilt in his bandolier, making no attempt to conceal it. (*This needs to go back to the Jedi. She deserved a decent… whatever it is Jedi do.*)
At this point he heard something strange from Tari's direction followed by his recounting of information. **And now he has some bass in his voice.** Primes says, slightly uncomfortable. **Not sure if I want to know what was in your locker.** He had finished getting his gear ready pretty quickly and started feeling around the room, trying to find the blast doors leading to the medical bay. **Medbay is the best plan though, I need to see what's going on so we can get out of this… ship, station, whatever and back to the Republic. Easiest would be to hitch a ride on that ship that is docking. Was it beat-up looking? Salvage crews are cowards and will take a trade over a fight any day.**
He spoke out to Tari as he shuffled along the wall, probably bumping into someone if they weren't done with their gear yet. **Why are you; umm, Tari, correct?; talking all cryptic, anyway?** He keeps shuffling. **I'm not following everything you guys are saying about time travel and all, but come on. Sure ancient droids are possible, with maintenance, the Jedi have one. But humanoids are something else. It's obvious I was put on ice, but I got briefed on OUR stasis tubes before the mission, and they were only rated for 300 years tops IF your power didn't run out first.** He finally stopped and crossed his arms in front of his chest, facing completely the wrong direction. **I have no idea where the medbay is.**

### **Ryder2101** (2014-04-16 13:35:36)

BCAD-344 turned towards the blast door as it began opening and moved to step through, bringing his weapon to the high ready. As he moved his servos whined in protest, the damage coupled with extended storage had taken its toll on his chassis. When he entered the next section he visually swept it and held position with his weapon trained on the corridor/blast door leading to docking bay until the rest of the group was ready to follow. *'Ship empty. Unknown ship docking. High probability of combat. Systems below standard performance levels…'*
**Error…Memory Leak…**
*344 attempted to stand, the air around him was filled with dust. His internal systems were failing, power levels rapidly dropping.* 'What happened? Flank attack? Severe damage to core systems. Need to retreat to tertiary base for repairs.' *Moments before he and a team of light duty battle droids were attempting a flanking maneuver on an entrenched rebelling slave force when they were hit from their own flank with heavy weapons fire at near point blank range. He was the only one attempting to get up now after the attack, the other droids were laid out in pieces around him.*
**Memory Resequenced**
*'Another memory error. How much time loss this time?'* 344 looks around and sees both Raven and Primes being lead to the room behind him which he understood to be the facility's medical bay. He decided to hold his position here, between the docking bay and the med bay. Unsure how long they would be he would rather be ready for anything that might come at them from the ship of a design he was unfamiliar with.

### **Alicia** (2014-04-16 22:06:37)

Moving out into the hallway the door to the left, the one leading further into the ship, is closed. The door for the medbay, however is open and the lights are just starting to come to life as the unlikely team move into the vicinity.
The medbay is what anyone might expect on a moderately sized ship or station. Kept sterile during the time of apparent neglect by the sealed door and other protocols, there’s a lack of any sort of dust on any surface including the three medical beds laid out around the room.
From their look at the map, Tari and BCAD easily identify the purpose of the two closed doors in the medbay. The on the right a heavier door, but not quite as thick as a blast door.
In a small nook in front of the storage room is another large display on the wall and a computer terminal. While slightly hidden by a partial wall and darkened glass, the display is already active with a chemical readout rotating on an invisible axis.

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-17 20:19:01)

Tari ponders Prime's comments: "**…perhaps it would be best to focus on one thing at a time. We can talk about whose refrigeration units are superior later on.**" He doesn't bother tugging the Clone or the woman, unsure of how they would perceive this. Instead, he walks slowly into the passage and towards the medbay doors and let's them follow the sounds of his footsteps and voice, careful to watch for a fall.
*Now to have a look around…*
Tari's stiff joints moan and creak - obvious signs of having been stored for quite some time. The labor droid chassis isn't ideal for any one task but, and he confirms this through minor discoveries every moment, it seems designed to perform adequately at a large range of tasks. Navigating derelict ships, then, is probably well within its capabilities. Fighting off invaders... perhaps less so.
He steps into the medbay cautiously, already aware of the rough layout thanks to the earlier console's revelations. "**Over there,**" he points, "**That's the Medical Storage.**" Remembering that that two of the others can't yet see, he adds: "**Um, on the left, I mean. I'm going to check and see if there's anything we can use to help restore your sight. There are some beds here as well - you can't really miss them. On either side of the room. Stand if you wish, I'll return in a moment.**"
Realizing BCAD has automatically assumed a defensive position in the hall, Tari chirps a burst transmission in Binary: "**Don't worry - I've got a tool kit and a few tricks up my sleeve. Nothing like what's up your sleeve, but I think we can fix you up too. Continue to keep watch, if you don't mind.**"
He spots the display on the wall: *And what's this…?*

**As a note to rest of you** - I'm wanting to focus on the blindness right now just because a) Tari's no good in a fight, and b) I can cure up condition track and hit points but I can't cure blindness. Again - the moment you guys get patched up, Tari's going to move back into a support roll of some sort. Always open to suggestions!

With her equipment quickly stored away, although perhaps a little disorganized for the time being due to her blindness Raven began to nod at the suggestion of following Tari to the med bay. At first Raven expected to be lead, but once she heard the clear audible footsteps. **“Do we have plenty of time get healed”**  asked Raven rhetorically once she heard Tari’s droid body stopped walking. Raven than began to search with hands out in front of her looking for the bed that was mentioned. Once Raven located the bed she quickly jumped onto the bed. **”I would love to SEE you find the cure for this blindness effect before our guest arrives”**  Raven added jokingly emphasizing the word see for an obvious pun.

### **Ryder2101** (2014-04-18 22:26:14)

344 listened as the two organics moved out of the stasis compartment into the Med Bay behind him. The sounds of hesitant feet shuffling and their voices filled his audio receptors as he kept his visual receptors on the blast door in front of him, preparing for the different possible entities that could come through it. *'Friend or Foe? Automated system states incursion, likely a foe.'* His thoughts and focus is interrupted when he received a burst transmission on his internal comlink. Unexpected it startled him and took him an extra nano second to translate the binary burst from Tari and send one back. **"That would be appreciated. With my current state I am unable to attempt self repair successfully. I must admit I am not familiar with the design of the droid chassis that you now control. Is it a combat model?"**

### **Jake** (2014-04-19 00:12:14)

Primes follows along, but does not search for the beds, preferring to stand.
**"Yeah, we really need to know what time table we're working with here. And maybe get eyes, erm… ocular receptors, on these boarders. There's no reason to assume they're hostile. And until we know they're not hostile I could definitely rig up some of my grenades to a tripwire of sorts, even if I can't see. Maybe even stun grenades if you guys have a preference."** He started checking his bandolier, pouches, and tool belt as he was talking, checking to make sure he had everything he needed. **"It's just like defusing land mines in the dark, except backwards. What could go wrong?"**
*(I think now I'm just rambling.)*
**"And we get on their ship so then I can get back to the Republic. And things will be O-kay."** He finally finished, talking to no one in particular.

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-19 10:20:23)

Tari pauses at the display, thinking through what he *may* have just read.
"**We certainly have plenty of time to wait and see who's coming to visit, if that helps any.**" he replies to Raven, adding "**…and I'm not convinced you'll be happy with the cure once you *do* see it.**"
Tari finds himself much more comfortable now. Whether it's the new chassis, the more familiar role of medic, or just that his own side affects from stasis are beginning to wear off, he notes the tendency toward sarcasm and snarkiness is leaving him.
"**That's not a bad idea, Clone. Explosives do have a tendency to make up for poor aim, though I would suggest something more on the *don't-forget-we're-in-a-space-station* side of things.**"
*Okay, so I'm **mostly** back to myself…*
Tari finishes studying the display, grabs a half dozen vials from the storage locker and puts them in his internal storage compartment, and walks back through the room to where BCAD is standing in the passage. He spots a white lab coat hanging on the wall, the kind with lots of pockets, and decides to grab one for himself.
*Why not?*
"**Not exactly a combat model, no, though I was something of a combat medic. Once upon a time… however long ago that may have been. I'm going to try something - you may feel an odd sensation or have unintelligible readouts for a moment, but I think it should patch you up a bit. I hope so, any way…**" The Binary burst, again, takes only a fraction of a second.
Tari places his hand on BCAD's shoulder and then stands still, concentrating his focus in the way he'd done so many times before. His crystal body glows from within his droid shell, and even the chassis and integrated armor seems to take on a very subtle red glow. He channels the Force through his arm and into BCAD-344's sentient being. It was something a Jedi would look down upon, he knew, but Master Aquinos had been right to recognize droids as living beings in the Force. Not like the Clone or the woman, but more than a piece of metal and servos. Tari could picture the internal components of BCAD beginning to heal, severed connections being repaired, and knew this was *actually* happening in the moment. Most of the damage was to the droid's memory banks and software though - there was very little in the way of physical scarring. He knew how to take that upon himself, too, but luckily that didn't seem to be the case here.
After a few moments of concentration, the Shard finishes his "surgery". He knew the others would have to be treated somehow, but at least maybe now, with another able-bodied ally, they might be able to stand a chance against whatever else this station had to throw at them.
*Hopefully…*
"**And how are you feeling now, BCAD-344?**" Tari asks aloud in Basic, "**Are your systems operating at something closer to optimal?**"
Yes, the healer role was indeed fitting Tari much better than the floating talking crystal one.

So I'm not sure that I need to roll **UtF** since my modifier is +15, but I'll use the Destiny Point option to bring BCAD all the way up the Condition Track. Also, just as an aside, Raven and Primes have yet to introduce themselves by name.

344 *feels* an unexplainable sensation as Tari's droid hand sets down on his shoulder. *'Warmth, Peace, Serenity.'* He could not fully describe the sensation as it filled every corner of his chassis but he could sense that his systems were becoming more functional then his primary processor rebooted.
**System Error detected…Rebooting**
**Power Core** 98% functional. 99.4 hours of power available.
**Mobility** Checking. . .94% overall functionality.
**Sensory** Calibrating. . .Audio Receptors 98%. . .Visual Receptors 97%.
**Weapon Systems** ReInitializing. . .Targeting System at 97%.
**Memory Core** Verifying. . .Error. . .Data corruption detected. . .Resequencing. . .Error. . .Core Programing corruption present. . .
He felt almost new again, aside from the fact of a much needed oil bath, he was fully operational. His memory core was still badly fragmented but his processors were fully functional again. He turned his head slightly to give the impression of looking at the droid host's face of Tari and spoke in his monotone mechanical voice, **"Systems fully operational. Memory core d-d-damage present. How did you do that without t-t-t-ools?"**

"**Well,**" Tari responds cryptically, "**We all have our talents.**"
He wonders at the hibernation sickness plaguing the others. There were options, of course, but...
"**Believe it or not, BCAD, that was the *easy* part. You just keep a sharp eye out for unwanted visitors, eh?**" Tari nods down the passageway and then re-enters the medical suite, shaking off the remaining effects of the Force ability he had just used. He turns so as best to address both Raven and Primes: "**Now for you two. I have good news and bad news. There's a lot of stuff in that storage closet over there but none of it is really going to help you - except these.**" He retrieves two of the syringes from his chest storage, even though they can't see what he's talking about. "**If I understand that display correctly, a shot of this will temporarily cure you of the hibernation sickness. After an undetermined amount of time, the effects will return… approximately twice as severe. A good sleep may seem like an odd solution to your problem considering what you've been doing for the last… well, however long we were in there… but I'm sure it would be best. Of course, I'm not sure we *have* eight hours for you to do that either.**"
Tari pauses to let his words sink in. It's been sometime since he's had a patient proper - an organic one anyway - and he knows to be delicate with the bad news.
*Brains can be so much more fragile than a good processor…*
"**I won't force it on you, you've got the make the decision for yourself. As I said, there's plenty of medpacs and equipment here that we can use but, again, *none* of it's really going to help you recover. That just happens naturally. Or you could roll up your sleeve and we could try these out. It's your call.**"
Tari leans back against the bulkhead and crosses his arms, mindful of the time factor. Of all the places to make a stand, if it comes to it, the medical bay is probably best.

The clone cocked his head to one side as he listened, and seemed to think for a moment. **"Twice as bad? You mean twice as blind? I can sleep it off later, we need to get going now.** Primes stopped for a second. **"It would be worse, but not PERMANENT, right? I've learned to deal with hangovers. What is it? A shot? A really big needle?**
**"How about you, Officer Whats-her-name? Do you want to take a nap? I don't think I'd be able to even if I tried."** He said to the side of the room where Raven was.

Raven quickly blinked at the mentioning the temporarily cure, and its side effects.  **“Dam we if you and dam if you don’t”** said Raven as she continued blinking despite not being able to see. Raven pauses for a moment before she spoke out. **“How fast does it work, are they auto injectors? We may need it to face the unknown.”** Raven added after her short pause.
Raven than rolled over towards Primes as she assumed officer what’s her name was her.  **“My name is Sarna ‘Raven’ Bell. Raven is my call sign. As for sleeping in a way I can force myself into a sleep like state. How about you guys?”** Raven replied towards Primes questions.

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-21 22:36:20)

"**Well, it's not terribly big, no,**" responds Tari. "**And I'm not sure exactly how blind you'll be - only one way to find out, I suppose!**" Without waiting for another prompt, he sticks Primes with the auto-injector and lets the vaccine do its work. His droid shell was incapable of smiling but he was inwardly quite amused with himself.
*Organics…*
Tari approaches Raven: "**A pleasure, Raven. I can rest when I need to but I'm also not blind at the moment. Feeling adventurous?**" He holds the auto-injector up, ready to administer the vaccine if she agrees.

Once Tari has gone into the storage room and retrieves the serum he notices the large display which was showing the rotating compound has switched to the feed of the docking airlock, the countdown showing two minutes remaining. The ship likewise is much closer, an umbilical extending to connect from the top of the YT-1300. While not a trained mechanic it’s obvious to Tari the ship is old and under repair. Patchwork strips of hull plating dot the top of the ship indicating the numerous repairs effected on it.
Touching the hypoinjector to a bare patch of Primes’ skin with a sharp hiss. At first it seems the substance doesn’t do anything. Primes is left staring blankly around, much as he’s had to endure since waking up. Then suddenly the pain he had been tolerating subsides, disappearing completely. For a long moment his limbs feel dull, but when he lifts his arm up experimentally is pleased to find the constant aching he’d been experiencing is completely gone.
Then his vision begins to clear. Slowly at first and then it takes on a sudden sharpness causing him to shield his eyes to allow them time to adjust. For the first time since he’s awoken, Primes feels great!
The hallway door enclosing the cyrogenic chamber and medical bay from the rest of the facility remains closed in front of the Rakata combat droid. With no change in his surroundings BCAD is left to stare between the proceedings in the medical bay and the metal surface of the obstructing door.
The intercom comes to life, the same mechanical female voice reporting: “***One minute till impending incursion.***”

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-23 19:22:08)

Tari hears the announcement but steadies his hand just inches from Raven's neck. "**I wonder if someone shouldn't go and *greet* our guests actually. It may help to know the condition of the rest of the ship, and I'm sure there's at least one bottleneck between here and there…?**" It's mostly just small talk - Tari is more focused on his patients. Raven seems hesitant but Primes looks to be almost completely restored.
*Restored… for now,* he reminds himself.

Raven paused as she tried to consider the ramification about the situation she was in. *’Does she really need the injection now, are the people friendly or at least neutral.’*  Thought Raven as she tried to look for the answers within herself and wondering what the repercussions were. **“With all these unknowns can you just hand me the auto injector, and if need be I’ll poke myself”** said Raven still wondering what the best course of action was. *’perhaps it’s best to immerse myself into the current’* thought Raven as she closed her eyes. Raven than closed her eyes remembering her teachings about seeing possible outcomes by immersing herself into the current. With Raven mind seemingly floating in the white current, she searched to see if she would need her vision and thus find out if can get away without using the injection.

**"I feel a lot better, but I still can't… Oh."** Primes said, straightening his helmet and flipping up the blast visor. **"Oh yeah!** Primes looked down at his hands and flexed his fingers. **"CT-357, back in action!"** He unslings his rifle, drops the power cell and slaps it back in. He puts it at the low ready and steps over to the monitor and tries to get it to display details on the structure they're in.

**"Mmmmhmmmm"** Primes looks at the map display. **"Points of interest, weapons locker, computer core, cockpit and escape pods. If we control that four way corridor just past the Computer Core then we have access to everything but the cockpit AND we can fall back to the escape pods if we have to.**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

</details>

**"I don't know how you want to meet these guys, but I recommend we have someone out in the corridor to "welcome" them and get a feeling for their intentions, while the rest of us take up a defensive position on the way to the escape pods. If… Raven,**  He says, remembering the name. **"wants to fly this mission blind, then she should hole up in there. Someone could aid us from the computer core, unless we can score something really nice in the weapons locker on the way.** 
He leaves the map up onscreen and turns around to take his first look at the other two people in the Medbay. **"It's nice to see you two, but I'm going to move out to secure that area I mentioned."**  Primes then taps on the side of his helmet. **"If you see anything on the feeds, let me know."**
Primes walks out into the corridor where BCAD took up position. He almost jerks his rifle up into position when he sees the warlike droid. **"AAAAhh… BCAD? Good to see you."** He walks by, giving BCAD a large berth. **"I'm going to secure our position, with a small stop at the weapons locker. Would you like to join me?"**
Primes stops, and feels the hilt in his bandolier. *(I'll look at it later, I just can't deal with that now. Unless…)* Primes strides purposefully up to the two "extra" lockers and wipes the dust off of the panels next to them that had the pictures of the occupants half-hoping and half-dreading seeing someone from his not-so-recent past. After a thorough inspection, he steps back from the lockers with a steely look in his eye and jogs the corridor to take his postion. *(That's a weird-looking data port.)* He thinks as an aside when he passes Tari's locker.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

SO! Primes will move toward the spot he picked out, making a quick stop at the weapons locker. If it's secured then he will quickly move onto the four way corridor. When he gets there, if he has time before meeting boarders, he will check if the north, west, and south doors are locked.

344 doesn't move at first, stuck in his own thoughts of the situation while going over the layout of the facility in his *head*. It takes a breath of a second for him to realize he was being spoken too as Primes steps around him. He gives him an awkward nod from his *head* without lowering the heavy blaster rifle then moves towards the door. **"I was having a similar thought-t-t-t, this position, although secure also traps us. Seeking bet-t-t-ter positioning against the arrivals what ever their intentions would be prud-d-dent. Shall I take point?"**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

If the weapons locker is secured with a lock that can be *picked* 344 will use his security kit and mechanical awesomeness to open it, if there is still time before the ship completes docking. Otherwise he'll take up a menacing defensive posture.

**"I'm not sure which of us would be better for them to meet"** Primes says over his shoulder. **"But I prefer to take point."**
At this he breaks into a run, deciding he can save stealth for later.

Tari hands over the serum to Raven, and she finds the hypoinjector an odd weight in her hand. Lighter than one might expect from such a piece of equipment. It forms easily enough in her hand and she finds the trigger for ejecting the contents into her flesh.
Her question in regards to how quickly it goes into effect answered as Primes proclaims the effects first hand. Reaching out to the Force for guidance she only gets the impression it will be beneficial. However, she knows well enough the future is always changing.
With the vague impressions she gets through the Force she can navigate well enough trusting on the Force to guide here from room to room without bumping into anything. She has to ask herself, however, if that will be enough when a fight breaks out.

---

Primes easily pulls up the map from the console in the medical bay and his plan quickly forms and is relayed to the others. Without their comm codes, however, he’s unable to communicate the plan to BCAD. As he begins to move away from the console, it switches back to the original feed of the external dock. The familiar class of the YT-1300 has docked with the umbilical fully extended. The outer door has opened and the inner door isn’t long to follow. The feed switches to the internal camera as two humanoids wearing breath masks step into the airlock. The lighting is dark but when they pull out a fusion lantern, it’s obvious one is a Devaronian and the other a human.
After testing the air supply they nod to each other and remove the masks yelling something back behind them into the ship. Two more follow into the airlock (another human and a Twi’lek), and they converse for a moment when they discover the airlock door into the facility proper won’t open from the control panel. It’s only a small delay as the Devaronian leaves and comes back with a large fusion cutter. The locked door has bought some time as they have to cut through it.

---

The investigation of the undisturbed lockers is fruitless. Only the four panels of the surviving occupants are lit. The remaining two are unpowered leaving them blank and wholly inaccessible. Whoever the nameless dead are continue to be a mystery. Investigating the corpses only answers one was a Bothan female and the other a Zabrak male (if his impressive typical horns are any indicator).

---

The door in front of BCAD remains closed. At least up until Primes approaches the door and as if sensing the clone’s intention opens without fuss. This happens with each door the group comes to in the route Prime’s had laid out; each door opening just as they go to hit the control panel. If anyone tries to go to a door not in the ‘plan’, the panel is unresponsive. Each room shows signs of not having been used in a long time. How long exactly is a mystery.
The weapons locker, Primes is disappointed to discover, is empty aside from the various racks which would serve as secure storage. Reaching the four-way intersection the north, south and east doors are still locked.

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-25 14:38:56)

"**Suit yourself,**" replied Tari, allowing the device to be taken from his hand. He watched as Primes and BCAD make their move toward the corridor.
*He **is** a clone, designation CT-357. Interesting…*
The Shard doesn't have much time to try and connect the dots - he's sure to be needed again soon. He moves back to the storage closet and begins to stock up. Not knowing if they'll have need of any of it, Tari prefers to be prepared for any eventuality. He loads a medical kit to the brim with six medpacs and then, on his way out, snags a surgery kit. It's all sterile thanks to... whatever else has kept this area clean. All in all, it takes only a few moments to spot what he was looking for and begin to follow the others.
*This is quite the group dynamic we have. I wonder if anyone's going to give **me** a gun…*
Tari hesitates in the passage, looking back to see that Raven is able to keep up. She had her reasons for not taking he serum now and he wasn't about to blame her - but it would be silly to lose someone so soon. Literally. This ship was big.

**"This is the way to where the escape pods SHOULD be."** Primes said, coming to stand in front of the south door. He looked over his shoulder to see BCAD in a well-practiced (well-programmed?) defensive position. *(Is he TRYING to be slightly more menacing right now?)* He shrugged, droids tended to respond well to orders, the real problems came when they had too much time to think.*(On the other hand, how OLD did they say this thing was again?)* **"Doors are all locked from here on out, hopefully that gives us enough time to get this possible escape route open. Cover me.**
*(I've got no detonite, which leaves out my preferred method, but I've made do before…)* Primes though as he bended his mind to the current problem.

As 344 conceded to the human he fell into step behind him quietly, outside of the whine of his aged servos. *'If he wishes to be in front so be it, I will cover him as I am able.'* He said nothing as they moved through the rooms, his processors still trying to make sense of the facts he had gathered so far.
Finding the weapons locker empty was disconcerting but expected with what he had observed so far on the empty and dusty station. When they reached their destination he found it slightly more confining than he had expected. A good place to make a stand but with very little cover. As he took up position keeping his weapon trained on the door the ship's crew was expected to come through he saw Primes looking over the blast doors and offered his assistance. **"I have some skill with various tools. Do you require assistance?"**

Raven slowly rose from the bed after receiving the injector. **”Hopefully this is not a bad idea to hold off on it”** . Raven said and thought out loud once she laid her feet back onto the deck. Raven than slowly began to rub her eyes once more hating the fact she was blind.  **“So what are the chances that these fellas would be peaceful, and we don’t have to rely on ancient diplomacy”** said Raven as she circled around the bed and attempted to follow Tari’s voice and or metal food steps.  **“So if you guys think these guys are hostile perhaps say a code word, like um Allergy Shot”**  said Raven with emphasis on the words allergy shot.

"**Deal.**"
Tari understands Raven's caution - would he take the serum under similar circumstances?
*The failings of the flesh…*
He continues down the corridor, mindful of his tag-along, and stops where Primes and BCAD are.
"**Hmm,**" he mutters, surveying the situation, "**I suppose this is where *my* usefulness wanes. I sincerely hope it stays that way for a while.**" He puts down the surgery kit adjusts the straps on the medical pack he's wearing - the droid chassis was still not completely merged to his liking. It could take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, he knew, for a Shard to fully integrate with his mechanical shell. A timeframe that Tari may not have. Things like subsystems and bulky armor tended to take their toll on joints and servos until they could be anticipated and accommodated with the proper movements.
*Still*, he thinks, *It's better than floating around on my own…*

Following behind Raven is able to use all her senses to keep up with the trio as they move down to long winding passages and navigate the conference room without so much as a stubbed toe. Truly the Force was her ally. Walking down the hallway from the medical bay the doors close as the last person vacates the area and the lights dim. Raven following behind the group and being the last to leave the area gets the distinct impression they're being herded. By what, however, is the question.
With the intent of getting the southern door open, Primes steps in closer to the control panel to get a better look at it in the dim light. He's barely touched the control panel before the door opens. The sounds of other doors opening in succession down the southern passage echo to their intersection. Lights flicker on one by one, lighting up the way to the escape pods.
“***Intruders have bypassed outer containment door,***” the female voice reports.
Moving down the corridor, only a couple of the doors remained closed. One BCAD and Primes recall leading to a storage room and the other a latrine off what looks like a lounge. The shapes of tables, couches and plush chairs covered by a fabric to protect them from dust are a ghostly image and a contrast to the rest of the ship which had just allowed the dust to cover the surfaces. A large display covers the wall in front of the couch. Already active it shows the feed of the docking area and the intruders working on bypassing the last containment door. The next rooms on the way to the escape pod are a series of work rooms featuring a computer terminal and a general repair workshop.

### **Ryder2101** (2014-04-27 21:36:43)

BCAD-344 turns to face the newly opened door as the sound travels back to the intersection. *'That is oddly automated. Something is assisting us and deterring that ship's crew. This station has all the signs of being abandoned. Could it be a droid without a body plugged into the main computers?'* Questions about the situation and the unknown filled his processors, his logic circuits having an issue determining an answer. **"I see my assistance is unneeded."** He says to Primes as the group moves through the intersection. **"I will t-t-take up rear guard.**
With the known threat to the rear of the group 344 decided to fall back as Primes and the rest continued forward. *'He seems capable of handling any issues that may arise in front of them, I will handle anything else from back here. This group is my only chance and figuring out when and where I am.'*
As he follows the group he keeps a close eye on the passage behind them, expecting that any moment that crew would be rushing down it. He still felt concerned about the apparent intelligence in how the station was reacting to their movements and shot Tari a burst transmission in Binary, **"I expect we are not alone on this station. Signs of long abandonment yet intelligent assistance from the station. I do not like how we are being *herded* towards the escape pods. I would rather take that ship."**

### **Jake** (2014-04-28 18:39:39)

**"This seems a bit too easy."** Primes said as they survey the rooms leading to the escape pods. **"The escape pods are still a fallback plan though. First we are meeting and talking to these guys who I assume are salvagers. I'm just not sure about the right mix of defense and diplomacy for this situation."**
Primes thinks about all the rooms they passed, and what furniture would make good barricades for the door or good barriers to shoot over.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I want to move enough furniture to make the area in front of the east door difficult terrain. Having crates or something to hide behind is secondary, since doorways will do for cover.

**"What do you think about that, guys?"** Primes asks after telling his plan to the group. **"I'd like to take more of a hidden position across hall to the west, while you guys negotiate from the south hallway. If things go badly…"**  There's a slight click and hum as he switched his rifle to the attached grenade launcher. **"I surprise them. ALSO, we should probably exchange com codes."**

Tari hesitates to involve himself in what seems to be a more tactical decision. His experience in battle was never like this. Cramped quarters, a non-combatant droid body, and too many other unknown factors contributed to an overall sense of foreboding.
"**I agree, it's interesting,**" he chirps back to BCAD, "**Though what it could all mean eludes me.**"
Turning to address the party in general: "**I'm uncertain about the wisdom of such an endeavor, though I do like the prospect of a *real* ship over an escape pod… Obviously, I have little offensive capabilities. I believe I may be a slightly better negotiator than a grenade, however, and will gladly attempt to meet our guests - if that is what we all decide.**"
The Clone was right, in a sense - the strangers almost certainly weren't expecting an ambush. It might just work, one way or the other.
*Or we all get to go back to sleep…*

Raven quietly gave nod at the suggestion for Primes suggestion of flanking the possible negotiation.
**“Well perhaps we can also make some barricades here in case things don’t go over too well. After all we don’t know much about these people, for all we know they can hate people being in cryo. Or simply the computer here is over zealous on intruder alerts”** said Raven as scanned the room she was in for something heavy with her arms around as if she was looking for something to move.
 **“As for com codes, I’m pretty sure mine are so outdated that a child can easily hack into them”** Raven paused for moment realizing how foolish she must look at the moment moving about trying to search for something to push.

### **Ryder2101** (2014-04-28 21:08:06)

BCAD takes up position just inside the last doorway as the group comes to a stop. Using the bulkhead as cover he aims the heavy blaster rifle back down the hall as he speaks in his slightly varied monotone mechanical voice, **"When we have time I can easily and quickly reprogram the com codes on everyone's communic-c-cations equipment to be synchronized and add-d-d-d encryption protocalls if they are capable."**
As an after thought he turns slightly to resurvey the room to Raven's suggestion in combination to Primes'. Most of the furniture looked like it might be bolted down but with some effort they could create an effective barrier to use as cover. **"I agree with the ret-t-tired Captain and TC-357 . The available furniture would prove no more than to slow them d-d-d-down but would give us extra time should the impending meeting become d-d-d-deadly."**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

If that's the plan I would suggest BCAD & Tari make the preperarions since they don't *tire* and give Raven and Primes time to get into position.
If there is time he will quickly reprogram or 'sync' everyone's comlinks to the same frequency and encrypt the ones that can. (I can edit and add the roll if required, though a quick link to his system should do the trick. Your call)

Try as you might, the furniture doesn’t budge having been bolted securely to the floor. The bolts could of course be removed or other forceful measures, which in essence would make the furniture unusable for their intended purpose. However, with the intruders already on the ship it becomes a question of time. With a lack of crates there isn’t much in the way to be used for a barricade.
With a lack of furniture to move about BCAD is able to configure his comrades’ comm frequency to link through his channel. While his comm systems are significantly out of date, they’re encrypted enough for any chatter to not draw immediate attention.
The feed on the monitor changes, showing the intruders breaking through the inner containment door. “***Intruders have breached containment.*** The voice pauses for a moment and then continues. “***Awaiting further instructions.***”

### **Jake** (2014-04-30 03:55:54)

Primes steps into the 4-way corridor to try and access the western door. **"It's fine if you're not combat capable, Tari… If I can get this… Door to open…"** Primes says while waving his arms in front of the western door console, thinking it didn't understand his intentions to go back.**"Then maybe you could support us from the computer core…"** He waves again. **"Lock down the airlock or docking clamps or something behind them…"** Another swipe. **"So they don't just leave in their ship as soon as they don't like the situation. We may need to hotwire this door."**
Primes crosses his arms. **"Glad, there's a backup plan, though.** He turns his back to the door and gets out his sidearm, a blaster pistol. **"Hopefully, you won't need this, but it's better than nothing."**

Primes immediately gets a response to his request as half of the display on the recreation wall transforms into a listing of various defensive systems inside the ship. Heavy blast doors all indicate they're locked down and key areas such as the cockpit, engineering compartment, airlock and docking area have emplacement turrets which list as offline.
Stepping back into the four-way intersection, Primes only has to raise his hand to the panel for the door to open. The lights flicker on to their partial luminescence, but it's enough for the clone to see by through his HUD.

When you look at the map, the green doors are the heavy blast doors and the turquoise are just doors. The orange are heavy blast doors that have been compromised.

Tari takes the sidearm from Primes and drops it into his large right jacket pocket. "**I'll see what I can do about the computer. No offense, Clone, but if *I'm* shooting at anybody… you're *probably* already dead.**" A wink of his optics and a mock salute and Tari is off to search for a terminal from which he can have a little more control over the situation.
*Locking the docking clamps is a pretty good idea actually, if it gets us a ship. Let's be honest though - I'm about to try and trap myself and three strangers on a strange ship with four other strangers…*
It was an awkward situation, even for a Shard.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, I'm cool with that. So I suppose I'll look for a terminal somewhere in that hallway. Not sure I need a roll here, but here's one!
**Use Computer** to lock the docking clamps on that ship and generally interfere with these guests (shut out lights, blast static over ship's comms, interefere with *their* comms, etc.).

Raven looked around with her hands out once more, this time she was looking for any sort of cover.
**“I would try making a 1 credit bet to See if these guys are hostile. But even I can See that is in bad taste. That and I don’t know how much 1 Republic credit is worth now”**  said Raven in a joking manner emphasizing the word ‘see’ twice after she had found some cover.
**“You know I’m also Blinded to any guess if they’re hostile or not”** said Raven after a small paused as she continued to make bad pun jokes.

Tari finds a computer workstation in the next room heading towards the airlocks. The computer seems more cooperative now that he’s not just trying to glean the information out of it. Finding the controls easy enough, he’s able to get the docking clamps holding the YT-1300 to lock into place and forces it to be released only with an encrypted password.
Stumbling only mildly about the recreation area, there’s a long couch she could crouch behind at the farthest end as well as a storage room closer to the four way passage she could duck into. She could also attempt to overturn one of the small tables with brute strength, or by cutting the legs free with her lightsaber.
From the feed on the long, concave recreation wall the intruders have almost cut through the door into the hallway. Won’t be long now till they make it through.

### **Jake** (2014-05-03 00:31:43)

**"Of course the Republic is still around, Raven."** Primes says with forced confidence. **"The ship that was docking was a YT-1300, it's not an uncommon ship."**
*(I'm not sure how many of them there are, but I bet if we open the blast doors and then close them after say, 30 seconds, maybe we can get them on either side of the door.)*
**"Umm… Computer! How many… Lifeforms boarded from the foreign vessel?"** Primes says while walking back toward the intersection. **"Any additional info about them would be good… as well…"** Primes speaks haltingly, feeling rather silly speaking to the air. He still carries his weapon at the low ready.
*(I feel better about our chances. But I wasn't trained to just kill and take things from lifeforms that aren't enemy combatants. If I can help it, we need to barter our way off, maybe we could give them the salvage rights to this tub for a lift back to the Republic.)*

### **BWS2K** (2014-05-03 15:31:40)

"**Docking clamps are locked.**" says Tari, loud enough to be heard down the passage way.
*No use staying too far from the action…*
He moves up closer to the intersection so as to be on hand should things get hairy. Direct combat still isn't his forte, but he draws the sidearm and tries to calm his mind. It's hard to know what to do with so many unknown factors, how to act or even who to trust. The Force, however, is a powerful ally at all times - most of all, perhaps, in just such occasions.

**“What… No that’s not what I meant. Like what’s the purchasing power of 1 Republic Credit. Is one credit from Jedi Civil war worth 40 credits of today, or can’t even get a stick of gum with one credit”** said Raven as she slowly behind the couch hoping it would provide adequate cover.
**”Remind me to teach you something about humor as well. It’s like you have the sense humor of a labor droid, no offense”**  said Raven as reached into her pouch grabbing hold of the auto injector just in case she needed it. There was a hint of anxiety in Raven's tone as she didn't know what to expect, as she knows next to nothing about the people beside her, coming inside or even the facility she was in.

### **Ryder2101** (2014-05-04 16:43:19)

BCAD listens to the banter of the others as he attempts to focus on the known. The male human had requested information from the station, information they would need should conflict arise as he *felt* it would. *'Tari has managed to secure transportation. Next is to deal with the imminent threat.'*
**"Any information on weapons they are carrying would-d-d-d also be helpful."** He said in conjunction to Primes' inquisition, then turned slightly to look over the room again seeing where Raven had managed to find cover. **"Money at this t-t-time shouldn't be our focus, unless you think it can buy us passage on that-t-t ship. If they are here for salvage of a d-d-d-derelict station I would think hardware such as myself would be highly sought after and unexpected-d-d-d. That is, if we truly are past the time my masters existed."** He mused for a moment on the last part of his statement. *'He would be valuable to someone, could that be used to gain their passage off this station?*

### **Jake** (2014-05-06 22:28:25)

**"You're not salvage, BCAD. You're an amazing source of history AND aiding a soldier of the Republic…"** He paused for a minute, looking back down the hallway. **"And possibly an officer of the Republic. I'm still not sure about Captain Couch back there."**
Primes looked up to the ceiling again, and tried to speak to the computer. **"Ummm… Computer. Not sure if I have to specify, but don't take any commands from the boarders."**
*(I can't think of anything else we need to prepare before we meet these lifeforms…)* Primes thought after going through his mental equipment checklist again. He keyed his helmet comlink. **"Are we set to open the doors, everyone? We might want to meet them before all the doors are breached."**

### **Alicia** (2014-05-07 11:04:18)

The computer responds to Prime’s halting questions with its mechanical precision, not seeming to be aware of the questionnaire’s opinion about speaking to seemingly nothing. “***Four life signs have been detected in the external dock. Two humans, one Devoranian and one Twi’lek.***” There’s a pause before the voice continues, processing BCAD’s added question. “***Intruders register as armed with energy weapons. No further information available. Minimum power available to internal sensors. Minimum power available for anti boarding systems.***”
There’s another long drawn out pause as on the feed the intruders have finally cut through the blast door into the hallway. “***Attention: Docking room doors have been compromised.***”
The feed splits into different camera views as one of the humans remains in the docking control room and the other three head into the hallway intersection. There’s no audio, but it’s obvious they’re debating on which door to try next.
The commlink crackles to life as the computer comes over the channel almost experimentally. “***Only ship personnel are authorized to make requests. Orders?***”

### **Ryder2101** (2014-05-07 11:34:03)

Hearing the station's computer come over the com link channel disturbed BCAD, but that was something he would have to address later. For now it accepted their team as allies.
**B.A.T.S. Initializing**...
Computing defensive options...affect gravity...secure blast doors...power station's anti-boarding systems...
Computing offensive options...meet enemy with overwhelming lethal force...set ambush...lock down corridor, open airlock...
BCAD's Battle Analysis and Tactical System engaged and began weighing possible options. With limited firepower and personnel their options were limited and relied heavily on the remaining capabilities of the station. Making a decision he replied over the comlink to the computer. **"Computer, can the artificial gravit-t-ty field in the boarder's section of the station be increased? If so, how high can it be increased over galact-t-tic standard? Additionally can you jam all communications but ours?"**
*'If the gravity is increased they will expend more energy attempting to move through the station, that can give us an advantage. As a last resort we can lock down the corridor and have the computer open an air lock and vent them into space.'* He wasn't sure how the rest of the group would take the last part of his idea, but it may be necessary if they get the upper hand. Without knowing them better he couldn't be sure but he believed their tactics would be different than his.
**"Tari, do you think you can get the station's anti-boarding systems fully operational?"** He sent the message via binary burst directly to him, hoping he might be able to work more of his *magic* and give themselves a better advantage.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

So BCAD has harsher tactical programming and deals with situations a bit differently. He's holding back, unsure of how his new comrades would react, that and his programming his battling independent thought.
He's essentially in defensive mode right now but could quickly switch to offensive if things go sour. Open to other suggestions ![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif))

### **Alicia** (2014-05-07 12:09:24)

“***This ship is not equipped to jam comm signals.***” The response takes only a moment as the computer makes it’s own calculations. “***Gravity may be maintained per individual sections. Safety threshold for artificial gravity is set to 5g. Manual override required for higher thresholds. Warning: artificial gravity is tied into life support. Life support is on reserve power. Damage to life support systems likely to maintain higher than standard gravity forces for extended period.***”

---

### **Ryder2101** (2014-05-07 15:12:41)

BCAD quickly assesses the response and speaks out loud, **"If no one objects I suggest increasing gravity in only the sections occupied by the boarders and shutting down life support in sections not occupied by us to conserve power. That should buy us more time and reduce the strain on the station's systems."** He hopes the additional gravity tires out the organics headed their way while also slowing them down without permanently damaging the systems Primes and Raven will need to survive.

---

### **Jake** (2014-05-07 17:58:09)

**"We just need to get off of here and back to civilization. I'm not sure fluctuating gravity fields and making life support unstable is the best way to open negotiations. We want to seem strong, but not hostile."** Primes leaned back against the wall. **"We can talk to them over the intercoms and let them decide our next move."**
**"Strategically, increasing the gravity is a sound idea. It's a nice ace in the hole, especially if we need to withdraw."** Primes said, acknowledging the idea. **"But it's probably pushing the boundaries of what we should do preemptively against people we don't know are hostile."**

### **Akisa** (2014-05-08 19:21:16)

**”Fair enough, but I also doubt these people are expecting a large fight. I’m more willing to bet they expect an easy salvage, with only possibility of wayward droids stopping them. After all the other pods didn’t exactly function as intended”**  Raven continued to hide behind the Couch as the group debated on activating gravity fields.
**”As for being captain couch or whatever, I resign after the end of the war due to force reduction resulting in me going into the inactive list. Since a commission last for a life time, technically I can be called up now and I would have to follow. Granted I bet no one expects me to be alive…”**  Raven added as she peaked her head above the couch facing the direction of Primes.

The voices of the others are once again heard as if at a distance, echoing in the background of Tari's consciousness as he focuses on the future. The Force is a fickle thing though, and reveals little Tari hasn't already guessed - the situation is not ideal.
In response to BCAD's question about the station's anti-boarding systems, Tari returns his concentration to the present: "**Possibly. I'd rather try something a little more… direct.**"
Switching to Basic, he addresses them all, including the station's apparently sentient computer: "**These are all lovely ideas, and I'm more than happy to oblige whatever seems appropriate but… Well, what if we all just stood here with our weapons drawn and opened the door? They can't tell who's blind, and whatever *else* they may be expecting, it won't be anything like *that*. Everything from there can just be improvisation.**"

Gathering at the intersection, it only takes a moment of conversing with the computer for the groups’ intentions to become known. Once the order is given, the doors heading east all open, revealing the rather stunned human wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit wielding the laser welder.
He jumps back in surprise as the door opens, and would have dropped the welder if the safety strap hadn’t been there. Suffice to say, it turns off as he loses his grasp. He’s quick to back peddle to let the others pass by him and takes a moment to readjust his grip.
“**Enh, Waddja do Der’k?**” the Twi’lek says as he moves past into the hallway with the other human. Not long after the mechanic follows, stopping to look at the panel to the E-Suit storage locker. Bantering as they walk in a language no one understands it stops with a sudden hush by the human as he spots someone in the junction “**Ship ain’t as dead as we thought,**” the human remarks.
Their hands immediately drawing the blaster pistols holstered at their hips.
His blaster pistol raised, the Twi’lek brings his wrist comm to his mouth, “**Enh Cap’n, we got live ones here.**”

I'm giving you a little time here to build up to this moment, put yourselves where you want to be when the door opens. Once they spot one of you, they'll stop just before making it to the intersection.

BCAD goes with the idea to meet the boarders head on and moves from his position up the corridor as the others follow behind. With limited cover he places himself dead center of the corridor and brings his heavy blaster rifle to the high ready and aims it at the blast door. His posture is lowered, providing a more menacing look as the bulk of his frame is hunched forward behind the rifle.
**"344 set and in position for maximum cover fire. Initializing t-t-tactical systems."**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

He will move to within a few meters of the door to be opened and provide a mass for either Raven or Primes to take cover behind. So likely he'll be what they see first. I'm assuming Raven or Tari will be our 'diplomat', correct me if I'm wrong. If his placement doesn't work let me know and I can adjust post.

</details>

As the door opens and the human backpedals from it he doesn't move but does bring his rifle to bear on the Twi'lek who appears to be leading the group in. **"Stop. No sudden moves. We wish to avoid unneed-d-d-ded violence."** His mechanical monotone voice echoes slightly in the near empty corridor as he turns up the gain on his vocabulator.

After addressing his comrades, Tari levels his blaster at the closed door.
"**Let's see if they bother to knock…**"
It feels good to finally have a clear goal, a common enemy, and despite his sub-par combat ability, Tari feels optimistic standing alongside BCAD and the others. Whatever else may happen, this will be one surprise they *won't* be facing totally blind.
*Well… not all of us anyway…*
The doors open and BCAD utters his warning. Tari considers following up with a remark of his own but then decides against it.
*Best to see their reaction first…*

Raven could feel the tension build up as the invaders started to make their way through the doors. Raven fought herself from over tighten to her grip on the auto injector as the invaders drew ever closer in fear of the unlikely event of breaking it as she tried to control her anxiety. However with everyone retreating back to the intersection Raven took the hit to fall back as well. Raven than focused to find another hiding spot which seemed to help relieve some of the anxiety she was feeling. *’I wonder if they’re going to give the signal’*  thought Raven once the intruders have opened the doors and spoke revealing they know everyone was here.

### **Jake** (2014-05-18 19:44:47)

**"Let's start simple…"** Primes said stepping forward, but keeping his rifle at the low-ready. **"Who are you and what are you doing on this ship?"**
*(He called out to his captain, we'll probably have better luck talking to him.)* Primes thought. *(These guys don't seem the brightest.)*
**"We want to talk to your captain."** Said Primes, trying to seem dangerous. **"Like the droid said, we can avoid trouble."**

### **Alicia** (2014-06-10 16:32:29)

The trio seem amused by the stranded crew of their supposed haul. “**Yah… no need for trouble,**” the Twi’lek echoes.”**Put your weapons away nice like and you can talk to the captain.**” He indicates down the hallway the way they had come, but only when they see weapons put away do they lower their own. Unless a firefight is on the agenda, they pair don’t back down.
While the Twi’lek watches the group, the human looks into the adjoining areas, the doors conveniently opened from when Primes was checking out the area a final time. Quickly spotting Raven, he grabs her elbow to move her into the group. “**Well hello, pretty. No need to be shy,” he says with a laugh. “**Looks to be all of them, Koshak.**”
The tech, Derek, has found himself a control panel and is attempting to get it to turn on. He’s going so far as to hook up a power supply he’s brought with him with very little apparent success. Frustrated, he hoists his laser cutter over on shoulder and heads back the way they had come. “**Going to find the cockpit.. better yet enginnering.**”
Escorting the crew down the hallway toward the dock, the human and twi’lek talk in a hushed tone in what sounds like Huttese. Their attention seems intent on Primes as they converse.
While most of the words are undecipherable one stands out: Jedai.
The tech has gotten to work on cutting his way into the cockpit, though the thicker bulkhead will obviously take a good while to get through. The two escorts don’t let the group linger for long as they indicated they should go into docking area. “**Cap’n, will speak to you here,**” the human says.**

### **Jake** (2014-06-16 14:06:53)

Primes motioned for everyone to holster their weapons, and did so himself. **"Hey, don't…** He tried to say as the human entered the other room. Primes was a bit too late and the human led Raven back to the group by the elbow. He sighed. **"We're going to the docking bay to go meet their captain."** He said by way of an explanation.
They walked down the hall in relative silence, only broken by the whispers of Huttese. Then he heard the Jedai word. *(Well that makes me a little nervous.)* His mind went to the saber on his belt. *(Everyone knows that clones aren't Jedi. Do they think I'm a murderer?)* He mentally shrugged. *(These scavengers can think what they want.)*
Primes walked into the docking bay, feeling his confidence bolstered by the security turrets that he was pretty sure he could activate relatively quickly. **"I'm here to speak to the captain of this ship."** He says loudly.

Still blinded by the effects of the hibernation chamber Raven opted to allow the man led her, but at the same time she carefully listen for the footsteps of her droid companion. **“Just to let you know towards end of the war I had a contagious disease before I fell to sleep”** said Raven bluffing hoping to dissuade any more advances from the elbow guy.
Provided that she was being lead in the same general direction as the rest of the group Raven continued to follow the person leading her to the captain.

Tari, well aware that he's no BCAD, lowers his weapon at Primes' cue. These folks didn't seem terribly surprised or concerned that there were people (*and droids*) walking around in their salvage haul. This might mean any number of things, of course, and he was happy to avoid a firefight if possible.
*Be a droid… be a droid… be a droid…*
Tari did his best to look non-threatening and subservient while trying to get a feel for how these visitors really felt about the situation. He stayed close to Raven too, wary of letting her get hurt or led astray. Her bluff, even if it worked, was still a bluff - she *was* blind.
"**Oh, the captain! How nice!**" he muttered, in his best protocol droid impersonation.

Raven is led only so far as to be brought to stand with the others before the pair lead them to the airlock. She’s then left to make her own way with the others to the docking bay. The way isn’t difficult to follow, the doors opened by the ship. It’s not until she reaches the intersection before the docking bay that she finds it difficult to navigate through.
Giving each other dubious looks, they laugh as Raven tries to bluff them, their tone growing rowdier as they continue talking to each other in Huttese and give Raven meaningful looks. Her attempts to dissuade them from advances seems to have the opposite effect.
The pair of boarders stop the group just outside the cut blast doors leading into the docking bay. The tech, Derek, is already setting to work cutting through the door to the cockpit.
“**Hold up there, soldier boy,**” the human starts. “**Cap’n will see ya when he’s good and ready.**” Kashok, the Twi’lek says something in jest and they both laugh. The cutter slips in Derek’s hands as he loses his focus.
“**Hey, watch it Der’k!**” Koshak warns good naturedly, his gaze taken away from the group of passengers.
Another human appears just inside the doorway looking at the trio with an authoritative air. If a pirate could have seniority just by looking gruff and by having the most scars then this man would fit the bill. He barely gives the group even a first glance as he speaks to Koshak and the as of yet named human escorts. “**Cap’n’s ready for you to take them over.**”

BCAD lowered his weapon reluctantly as the rest of the group did. He almost shuffled in the direction of Raven when the human pulled her to her feet but realized a sudden movement from him could be taken very badly. He kept a close eye on her as they were led back towards the docking area.
He tried to estimate how long it would take for the boarders to cut through the cockpit doors with the equipment he could see. *"How long before we are no longer a temporary distraction to their obvious goals?”* He wondered how the next conversation would go with the pirate captain and mentally prepared himself for the need of a sudden surge of movement or power. *"These next few moments should prove interesting.*"

### **Jake** (2014-07-23 17:41:11)

*(Yeah, I'm willing to talk, but these pirates will probably march us on the ship and right to a holding cell if we just keep going along with them)* Primes thinks darkly. He glances at the other guys in the docking bay talking and chuckling and the fusion cutter at work on the cockpit doors. *(I'm not going to let them get the upper hand.)*
**"Tell 'Cap'n' that we're ready to talk out here. We're tired of getting lead around by his lackeys while HE is trying to salvage OUR ship.** Primes then turns to Derek. **And all you *shabuir* are going to stop cutting and anything else you're doing until we talk to the Captain, or things are getting farking ugly.** Primes prepares to grab a grenade since things might go wahoonie-shaped any moment, but he wants the scavengers to know that they're not holding all the cards. **"Computer, activate docking bay defenses and prepare to fire on intruders."**
