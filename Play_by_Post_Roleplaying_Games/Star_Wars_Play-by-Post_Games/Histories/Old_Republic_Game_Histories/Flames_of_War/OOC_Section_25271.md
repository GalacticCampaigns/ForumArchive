The place to bring all the OOC discussion and questions, so we can keep OOC comments in the story threads to a minimum

### **Redshaw** (2012-09-09 22:18:27)

Sorry I haven't been eagerly posting, y'all. Making a trip out to Utah for a couple weeks, so I'm only online every now and then. Looking swell so far!

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-09 22:30:58)

Well, no problem, but thanks for the heads up. Posting has been a little slower than expected, but perhaps calm cantinas don´t inspire as much time for reflections and socializing as I would have thought. Oh well, I´m gonna grab some sleep now, and then it´ll go off with a bang when I wake up...

---

### **Anodyzed** (2012-09-10 12:13:47)

Yea, sitting in a cantina waiting for the unknown doesn't inspire me much to expound.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-11 20:42:06)

Just some quick notes for those not very familiar with PbP, or more specifically my preferences in PbP
When it comes to periods where we break down time into turns (be it combat or something else where time matters, like a Skill Challenge), I won´t require you to post in initiative order. You may do so if you want to of course, but keep in mind that it will slow the game down. Basically what I will do is wait until I get the entire round (or a very large coherent initiative segment of a round), and then I will calculate the results of what happens, and present it in as cinematic a fashion as possible and suitable.
Keep in mind that this could result in some of your actions being invalidated (such as someone killing the opponent you had been attempting to attack), so you might want to at least include some hints as to what your characters intentions are. I know this can take away some of the tactical thinking and optimization of the game (and is one reason why I think the few D&D4 games we´ve tried running here didn´t work so well), but IME it helps to keep the pace going, whcih tends to be more important in a PbP game.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-13 09:04:27)

Oh, I forgot that I was going to provide some tips for your posting, just to smooth things over from the start.
Please make sure that when you take an action (makes an attack, skill check, or whatever), you note what the action is for. I´ve had people post just a skill check in scenarios where I could think of at least a dozen valid uses for that check, making it impossible for me to make some sort of educated guess.
Also please separate clearly any OOC posting from IC text, keeping the OOC section at the bottom of your post, marked by double parentheses, brackets, or if it becomes too large, a spoiler box. Not only does this make it easier for anyone who just wants to follow the adventure to just enjoy the story, but it also avoids any confusion as to what you are doing. For example, aiming in a narrative sense might not necessarily mean that you are using the Aim action. If the mechanical parts of your actions is clearly located at the bottom, things become easier.
When including checks in your posts, please note any special ability you have included in the roll. For example, if you have included the bonus from Point Blank Shot in an attack roll, note it. That way I don´t have to go back to your sheets to check if it was included or not. Of course you will not always know what abilities applies, but things like Point Blank Shot, Zero Range, Precise Shot and so on is often obvious.
Finally, how do you feel about using maps? Do you need them, or can you survive with me just trying to be good at describing the scene? Just asking since I can try to provide maps, but history has shown that this is not my strong side, and my maps are usually of quite poor quality.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2012-09-13 10:20:13)

In this particular encounter, I'd really appreciate the use of maps, even just rudimentary ones wherein locations, facing and possible entry and exit points are provided. In my point of view, It would really take away a lot of guesswork.
Cheers!

---

### **Anodyzed** (2012-09-13 12:10:35)

I'm not so needing of maps until our need to be 'tactically smart' becomes less possible because we can't truly take advantage of those opportunities.
That said, if you're going to 'BE' our eyes and other senses, then I imagine that kind of detail (at least what we need to see) is going to be in the GM posts.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-13 12:17:26)

I can try to make some maps if a majority of people want it, but my experience have just been that people have had some trouble understanding my maps in the past.
If not, I´ll try to make sure I take up everything that you might find interesting about a location in my posts.

---

### **Duggs** (2012-09-13 17:53:52)

Maps are not that important to me. I am just fine with your explanation of things.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-14 04:47:17)

This is a bit embarrassing, but I forgot to add in that you took 15 points of damage last round Duggs <!-- s:red: -->![:red:](https://i.ibb.co/xStHX79F/icon-redface.gif)<!-- s:red: -->

### **Duggs** (2012-09-14 06:50:14)

No worries. I still have plenty of health left.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2012-09-14 10:47:09)

Since Duggs and Anodyzed doesn't need the map, I guess I'll have to do without it.
Will post questions here if needed.
Cheers!

---

### **Anodyzed** (2012-09-14 12:56:12)

I just noticed you 'corrected' a previous damage roll. Can we do that?
I wasn't paying close enough attention, my fault I know,
but Lonzo's second attack and damage should have been another +2 to hit and another die damage (4d8+5) instead of (3d8+3),
and since he has Devastating attack, how do you figure the Threshold damage from him? it should be 5 lower when he's using a pistol.

---

### **Anodyzed** (2012-09-14 12:58:07)

In general, I find it harder to play a character I didn't 'grow' into. I realize I created this character, but when you start at level 1 and play them up through the higher or even mid-levels, you learn them as you go, over time.
Plopping a Level 7 up at once, its going to take time to learn his nuances and perks. Does anyone else have that problem with a 'new' higher level character?

If you mean that I told Duggs he took damage, that wasn´t so much a correction as just me having forgotten to put it in. As for you post, I´m not sure exactly how you got those numbers, so let´s break it down. You rolled 1d20+10 for the attack roll, and Lonzo´s base ranged attack is +9, and he has Weapon Focus(Pistols), so that´s covered there. He also has Point Blank Shot, which would add +1 to attack and damage when applicable (and let´s face it, most of the time it is), so you should have gotten another point for your attack roll there. The only other thing you have that would increase attack is Zero Range, but that only works against adjacent targets.
If you were getting the extra damage die from Zero Range, then see above why that wouldn´t work, but you can still gain an extra damage die by taking the Aim action (two consecutive Swift actions before attacking) since you have the Deadeye feat. Personally I would definitely do this, and this was also the reason I ask that you guys place your OOC comments separate from the IC section. When it just says "aim" in the post, I don´t know if you mean it in a narrative sense, or actually want to take the Aim action, but an action breakdown in the OOC section takes care of that.
If you want I can take account for that when resolving the round, and roll an extra die for you. I wouldn´t recommend trying to alter your roll unless you don´t mind losing the original result. Also thank you for noting that you have Devastating Attack, that helps me to remember to apply it in damage calculation. As a tip, I would recommend expanding the section with attacks in your sheet to cover not just melee/ranged attacks, but the various weapons that you carry. This makes it very obvious for example that Pistols are at +1 attack, something that might be forgotten by just looking at a "ranged" value. Most sheets also have a "Atk Options" line, where they place various things that can influence attacks (Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Far Shot, etc) easily in sight of whoever looks over the sheet. Take a look at some other sheets to see what I mean.

Speaking only for myself, I have never experienced this problem. I feel that I grow into the character during the process of creating him, though some more subtle character perks and behavior traits tend to be defined as I play a character, depending on what situations develop an how I feel like responding to them. I am a bit curious however as to why you would feel this way, since other than a larger batch of abilities and a larger piece of background, I don´t think settling down to play a high-level character is any different from a low-level one.

---

### **Anodyzed** (2012-09-14 19:52:41)

I was thinking his base attack was 7. I see its six, so the +3 dex and +1 pistols is the +10 on the roll.
Should have been another +1 for Point blank shot, on both hit and damage
I did only 'narrate' the Aim instead of specifying the Deadeye, so if you want to forego that, I understand.
I didn't include Zero Range, I realize quite easily that the target isn't in any adjacent square to my character.

---

### **Parmenter** (2012-09-17 18:02:41)

Duggs, just wanted to express my sympathy with that damage roll. I cringed when I read it.

---

### **Duggs** (2012-09-17 18:13:31)

So did I. I had an awesome hit roll and then totally sucked it up with damage.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2012-09-23 04:23:53)

Questions:
1. Should have asked this before taking the the Shien Deflection Lightsaber Form Power.

Does the Shien Delection gives me an extra move action or just an opportunity to move by using my move action. Example: I move to location A, a Mando shoots at me, I Shien Deflect his attack. Do I get to move again to close the distance for an attack?
Does moving in this fashion provokes attack of opportunity?
Can I use this power even against a miss just to gain the other benefits (move & attack)?
2. I don't know if I got it right. Just to clarify, the exit is at my right rear, the war droid have several disabled weapons (it still have lots working tho'), 1 Mando in jetpack behind and above the mounted Mando, another being engaged in melee by Marti.
3. How far am I from each target?
Thanks! <!-- s:)) -->![:))](https://i.ibb.co/ZRrbtNtj/icon-razz.gif)<!-- s:)) -->

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-23 04:55:54)

1. The power does not give you any extra actions, but when using it you can move (as part of using the power) a minimum of up to your speed towards whoever attacked you and you end up within reach, you can make a melee attack against him. So yes, you would get to move even if you have already moved on your turn. Considering that this power will almost exclusively be used when it is not your turn, it would be kind of harsh to force you to "save" a Move action on your turn to be able to use it if you get a chance.
Since the power text does not mention that it doesn´t (and many movement effects have that information in them) provokes AoOs, I´m going to assume that it does.
Yes, the only activation requirement is that someone makes a non-area ranged attack against you.
2. Formerly, the exit was a little to your rear right, but after the last round you have a new frickin exit several meters wide behind you <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> You would have no idea of knowing if the droid have any disabled weapons, but yes, it does still appear to have some that are functioning <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> Otherwise you are pretty much correct, worth noting is that the soldier on the ground is on the right side of the war droid.
3. You are 2 squares away from the droid and its rider, and the flier is just behind them, so make that 5 squares away. The soldier on the ground is about 8 squares away, counting some diagonal movement, longer if you want to avoid an AoO from the droid. Hmm...maybe I should draw a small map just to help myself keep track of these things...

### **KUPALISSSS** (2012-09-23 06:30:29)

Thanks for the insights. Shien Deflection is still a very useful power nonetheless.

Yes, a map would be most useful.
Thanks!

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-23 14:17:27)

Yes, combined with its Lightsaber Form powers, I´d say that Shien is one of the best lightsaber forms in the game, only really competing with Juyo IMO.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-26 09:04:45)

Just as a heads-up for you, I will be going away for a few days on a military exercise, starting early tomorrow and returning sometime on Sunday, so you´ll likely see no activity from me until then. If people post during the day so I can advance the story before I leave, I will try to have something up, but otherwise it won´t be updated before Sunday (and I hope everyone will be able to post before then).

Anyway, sorry for not making an update in a while, last week was hectic, and tiring both physically and mentally. Things have slowed down a bit though, and I will have something for you tomorrow. As soon as I figure out how to describe this last string of useless attack rolls without making everyone involved look completely incompetent...

---

### **Anodyzed** (2012-10-11 16:39:19)

Pretty much feeling 'incompetent' already with the rolls I've made, and the results its garnered for me.
Not sure how to defeat those personal shields, not really sure as a player how they even work (DR or AC?) so not real pleased with the way the fight's going so far. OF course, I'd be more happy if I was shooting at them with a rifle, but woudln't have had that with me in a bar in a peaceful backwater, so goes without saying Lonzo needs to get back to his room to pick up his rifle and other gear!

---

### **Anodyzed** (2012-10-11 16:39:56)

Question for the other players: Do you think ion weapons will take down those shields?

---

### **Duggs** (2012-10-11 16:55:49)

Ion might work, but it might also be better for us to move out of the bar and try to draw them out.

Ah, looks like I came back just in time...people are thinking of quitting...
But in all seriousness though, I´m sorry for being so absent lately. I´m not going to go into any long explanation of why I was gone and so on, but merely acknowledge that at the very least I should have communicated it to you. That being said, I´m now feeling comfortable in putting visits to this site back into my (almost) daily routine, and if people are still around, I´d like to take up running this game again. After all, the war is just starting, and you still have a long way to go...
I´d like to make a quick head count before we go on though, and since I wouldn´t be surprised if we´ve lost someone, I might open up the casting again to fill the void.

But no, joking aside (though I actually study ninjutsu, which does make me a ninja-in-training), I´m sorry. I´ve been neglecting this site completely, and though I´ve been occupied with other things, that´s no excuse. I´ve always been pissed when people disappeared from this site without a word in the past, but apparently it wasn´t that hard. I don´t know if it was the declining activity on the site, me getting an RPG/Star Wars overload (which I never thought could happen, but it actually felt that way), being burdened by other things, or sheer laziness, but I´m guessing it was a combination that caused me to go from logging in here daily to not logging in at all.
But anyway, I´m back now, determined to not leave things in a complete mess. I had a great story planned for you, and I intend to see you though it. I´ve checked your last logins, and it seems like everyone is coming in frequently, so I won´t make any role call, but rather just get things going again.
@Anodyzed: I´m sorry if you want to leave, but I don´t blame you. I haven´t been a very good GM. I will get this thing going again though, and you are free to take up your character if you want to keep going. I won´t kill him off gruesomely...I promise

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-02-02 06:50:32)

@Parmenter - [Guerilla Warfare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare")
@KUPALISS - The entrance to the mines is on the outskirts of the settlement. If you think of the settlement as a clock (it´s not perfectly circular, but hopefully you get what I´m saying here), The cantina might have been around 3-4, whereas the mine entrance might be in the general 10-11 direction or something, if that makes any sense?
The cantina is pretty roughed up. Not burning, but in addition to thedamage it sustained during your battle, it took some punishment during the initial assault, when the Basilisk dropped through the roof and so on. The basilisk exploding also caused some furter destruction.
Without making a closer exam, it would be reasonable to assume that the Basilisk rider and his nearby companion was thoroughly incinerated by the droid exploding, and since you haven´t been bothered for a few moments here, it seems likely that anyone inside is either dead or knocked out.

None of them are in your immediate vicinity, and they seem to be moving at random, attacking other people or just generally causing damage. If they had spotted you, you´d probably know it <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
Their main base of operations (where the shuttles landed) are maybe 1-2 kilometers away, though you have a pretty good view over that part of the settlement, as the way up to the mines along which the Borehole and the rest of your current surroundings is located is kind of uphill.

I'm not on yet (soon - once Doctor Sural is approved I'll post him <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> ) but it's worth noting that I just cannot read yellow posts and, whilst they may be readable in the dark template, yellow-on-white (as it occurs in the default template) was banned in heraldry becuasea it was just so difficult to see. It's also a dodgy design pairing, too (I've worked and designed for print companies).
Thanks for helping out, guys (that's a non-gender-specific "guys"). <!-- s:trooper: -->:<!-- s:trooper: -->

There's a post here which allows you to see the font colors in the different styles.

DA,I hope you don't mind. I made a simple map so we can determine facing and distance of our party and the Mandos. I'm not sure if I made it right tho'.
Anyway, where are we? Where are the Mandos?
Thanks! <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Huh, I guess I need to get even better at setting up scenes if you have to ask me where you and they are...oh well...
I would not suggest using that map for any kind of exact references, since its kinda off, but as a general idea it works.
You guys would be somewhere in the region around B/C-15/16, and the Mandalorians are somewhere around K/L/M-20/21

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-03-23 00:15:00)

Thanks for the info DA.
Yes. I'm just after the general location/distance and facings.
From the info you provided, we are approx. 200m away from the mine entrance (although you provided this info in your IC post, I thought we are directly in front of the mine entrance) and the Mandos are now much closer to the mine entrance (approx 20m) now.
Although you didn't mention from what direction the Mandos were coming from, I would assume that they are the ones on direct approach to the mines.
I'm just trying to formulate a plan and taking line of fire in consideration.
I'd prefer to approach the Mandos from the side (maybe we have to run to B-C 21-22 if there are still trees there and if we can exit the treeline before the Mandos enter the mines) so that Lonzo and the Baragwin can shoot at the Mando rear guards. While distracted by the blaster fire, we will make our attack.
However, 200m is extreme range for rifles which might require some revisions in the plans.
Suggestion guys?
Last question DA. How far are the Mandos from each other? Mando pair carrying a crate from the next pair to the rear guards? Are they on single file or side to side? Thanks! <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-23 07:36:17)

Well, you didn´t take the direct approach tpwards the mine entrance since you moved through the forests. And the reason they are much closer than they were when I gave the last approximation is that you have spent some time doing introductions and planning and otherwise talking - you didnt think they´d just stand still while you did that, did you? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
And yes, they are the ones on the direct approach to the mines, specifically coming on the path from the settlement.
Not sure what´s so extreme about 200 m for rifles, but you should also note that you are 200 m from the entrance, not the soldiers - though as you´ve noticed, those distances have grown to become more and more equal.
The ones carrying crates are moving single file with the sentries flanking them.

No issues here. You did describe that the Mandos were moving towards the mine. We just didn't know how near they are at the mine entrance.

I meant 200m is long range for rifles, hence a -10 to attack. Sorry. <!-- s:red: -->![:red:](https://i.ibb.co/xStHX79F/icon-redface.gif)<!-- s:red: -->

Do you mean like this:?
           0■0
       x           x
           0■0
0 = Mando carrying the crate
■ = crate
x = Mando Guard

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-25 03:34:18)

200 m is only Medium range for Rifles, so -5 only
And yes, something like that

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-03-25 04:21:08)

Thanks for the reply.
Guys, any input on how best to approach the Mandos?

---

### **Duggs** (2013-03-25 16:53:14)

We could approach from either side, putting the guards in the way of the other.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-03-28 14:11:31)

Good suggestion. Anyway, can we really take on 6 Mandos without anyone of them being able to call for back-up?
Makes me think it might be easier to shoot at the munitions crates and cause it to explode on the Mandos. Not sure how tought those crates are tho'.
BTW, just a heads up.
I'll be away on vacation from April 4-9. I'm not sure if the place I'll be staying in will have internet access or not. If there is, I'll be able to post. Otherwise, at least you all know. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-04-01 06:26:04)

I assume we're sticking to the plan.
In case I succeed in my deception roll and we manage to close in on the Mandos, would this attack plan be appropriate?

Sounds good to me. Though I'll offer my opinion on the disguise, if possible.
Deception: Disguising the Jedi.

How does this work? Aid another?

Looks good to me.

Either an assistance or as the main roll being you differing to me to give my opinion of your disguise.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-04-01 23:57:11)

Sound great to me. Marti is definitely better at disguises. I think we'll have to mention this in game tho'. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

---

### **Parmenter** (2013-04-02 00:32:46)

It be mentioned in game. Edited my last post, feel free to respond.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-04-02 06:10:29)

I suggest you edit the portion where you tie your hands. I think it should come after you repair the armor. It would be quite hard doing that with your hands tied. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-04-09 15:35:34)

Wow, you guys have been busy coming up with interesting things to do. Just for some clarification, are you going to leave things as they are or edit your posts somewhat? I ask because I think it is very important that you tell me if you are going to edit a post (this should be avoided as much as possible in PbP in my opinion), as I otherwise have no way of knowing if a post has been edited. Was planning to move along today, so we´ll see what happens.

---

### **Duggs** (2013-04-09 16:24:40)

I am good with my post.

---

### **Parmenter** (2013-04-10 04:16:00)

I was not going to edit the hands being tied, as it doesn't much interrupt the swinging of a hammer... and someone else can hold the armor to her needs.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-06-02 21:03:23)

OK, so I know I´ve been pretty busy and not very much around lately (a lot of stuff have been happening, some which took me quite off guard), but no one has made a post? Are people still interested in this?

Yeah, I´m going to look into that, but I kind of thought something would have happened in the weeks I´ve been busy. I haven´t forgotten about you though, but if this stillness keeps up, I might have to start you off in a parallel storyline, which I had hoped to avoid.

---

### **Parmenter** (2013-06-03 03:09:22)

I'm still ready and able.

OK, good. I read in the events section that Duggs might be busy for a while. I was just curious since there had been no posts in quite a while. You weren´t waiting for me I hope?

---

### **Duggs** (2013-06-03 20:02:08)

I will be busy, but still around as much as I can be. Since I was being escorted I was waiting for my escort to reply so I could pull from his actions.

Much appreciated, but if you even suspect it might be too much don't, for the sake of the main game! It's too easy to open up new threads and new games and end up waaay too overcommitted. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

Okay, so my final exam before summer is done, I´ve had my mandatory lazy weekend to celebrate it, and now I just have to sit down and wait for the university to accept or decline my thesis proposal, so I have something to do during the summer. Sounds like the perfect time to sit down and kickstart this thing again with a bang.
Pay attention to the word "bang"...

### **Duggs** (2013-06-09 18:50:01)

Sounds good man. Good luck with the thesis.
