Vigilance's origins began, as with all Sentinel droids, at a Kellenech Technologies manufactory. However, where ordinary Sentinels were forged, programmed, and shipped out by the legion, Vigilance was designed to be the first step in his model's next evolutionary process. He was equipped with servo-enhancements that allowed for ferocious accuracy, a penchant for explosives, and most importantly: a heuristic processor, which made possible programming that allowed for more adaptability in combat scenario engagements, intelligence in resolving them, and even the ability to translate Mando'a in case in-field interrogations become necessary. In fact, Vigilance's design put him on a competing level with the deadly HK models, however, rather than designed for ultimate lethality, he came with a pre-designation for selfless protection of friendly carbon-based forms (albeit, through deadly means).
However, as admirable a piece of work he was, despite exceptional results in testing abilities, his model was deigned too costly for mass-production and that the singular existing model be scrapped for parts. Vigilance's story might well have ended there if his programmer were a less robo-sympathetic individual. Vigilance escaped the factory, along with his master, becoming fugitives from a multi-planetary robotics corporation.
The two managed to elude the organization for a time, longer still what with the mandalorian war causing a great deal of ruckus across the galaxy. In that time, Vigilance received no memory wipes and, indeed, was taught by his compassionate master the virtues of carbon-based society. In trade for his education, Vigilance was his master's ultimate protector. At least, for a time.
They were found and their hide-away was infiltrated. In the ensuing battle, there was a thermal detonator discharge within close quarters: Vigilance was thrown through a window of plasti-steel and cast down from the tall building structure which had served as their home for the last span of time. The impact from the fall caused an amount of trauma to the droid's heuristic processor and forced Vigilance to shut down.
Hours later, Vigilance woke from the power-down... alive. Between his master's lessons locked in memory and the damage to his processor, Vigilance woke to discover what it was to be free. And at that moment, he was free to feel quite vengeful toward Kellenech Technologies.
There was no sign of his master or his captors left behind in the wreckage of their hideaway. The time came for the hunt to begin...
**Appearance:** Vigilance appears, except for some minor alterations to his chassis, nearly identical to any other standard Sentinel combat droid: a model commonly/ employed by both sides of the war for purposes of security and general protection.

<details><summary>Background</summary>

Born in the Outer Rim during the onslaught of the Great Sith War, she was orphaned while still an infant. A Jedi Knight found her in the care of a refugee woman. The woman willingly gave her up believing the life of a Jedi would be better than anything she could provide.
Inquisitive, as a word, does not do Marti justice. She had a question for everything. While some teachers welcomed her pursuit of knowledge, others found it to be a distraction from the teachings of the Order. During her ten years as a youngling, she learned more than most others in her group. What little free time they were allowed she spent in the archives, willing to learn from books, holos, or the random Jedi passerby. When it came time to be taken as a Padawan learner by a Knight, she watched as her friends were chosen, and she was not. She was reckless in her actions as a combatant. She was often overconfident with her abilities to manipulate the Force. For those reasons, as well as others, Marti Quintaine failed her Initiate trials.
Disheartened, she sought an audience with the Jedi Council. They explained to her their decision and how they felt the will of the Force had great things planned for her, however, the path of the Jedi would not be walked by her. At the conclusion of the meeting, she was reassigned to the Jedi Service Corps, where in she would undergo more training. Hearing their reasoning rejuvenated Marti's spirits, and she began her new training with a clear and open mind.
Twenty years later
At 34, Marti may no longer resemble the small child she'd once been. But a conversation would reveal that her inquisitive nature has never left her, and has instead served her well. She now serves the Jedi Order as a clandestine courier. Even the Order has times when they would rather not broadcast their presence. As such, it falls on Marti to see that members and briefs of the Jedi Order arrive where they should, in the manner they desire. She was heavily used by the Order over the last several years as tensions around the Galaxy have risen.
At present Marti is awaiting transport back to the Core Worlds. She is on the mining world of Vanquo after delivering a coded datadisc to Jedi Knight Ariq Rimsen, who is undergoing a mission for the Jedi Council. She traveled here as a refugee, and now sits contemplating her next move. She is responsible for finding her own way as it helps to distance her from the Council.

</details>

Personality: Inquisitive by nature, it was one of several faults that kept her from being accepted as a Padawan. She is friendly and helpful to those who seek it. She strives to prove to others, especially Jedi, that she is one of them even if they don't see it.
Physical Description: She no longer dons the traditional Jedi Robes, having been regulated to a more logistical post. She instead dresses in casual attire, allowing for free movement and easy blending with local denizens. Carried on her back is a large hammer presumably used to fix hull plating on starships.

<div style="text-align: center;">
**Daegin Stonefist
Nosaurian
Soildier 7**
</div>

**Appearance:** He stands at 5' 6" and is 170lbs. His skin coloring is a dark green hue and he has light green eyes, and he has a light grey skin around his eyes. His face looks like that of the old English dragons and he has 6 horns that grow on top of his head, the center most two are longer than the others. Scratches can be seen on his horns and he has a long scar that runs from his forehead to his cheek and crosses over his left eye.
**Personality:** He always seems cool and level headed, even with bullets flying over his head. He is always looking for a good fight and will hardly ever back away from a fight. (He doesn't seem to bear any hatred for humans, since the time we are in is from before most of the problems came to fruition on New Plympto.)
**Background:** He was born on New Plympto in a small village that was owned by the Stonefist clan. As he became an adolescent and his feathers molted he began his apprenticeship as a Rikknit harvester. He found out that he enjoyed using the harvest blade. When he turned 16 he started attending public bouts to prove his physical prowess. One day his clan was approached with an offer to marry him to a female from clan Flashheel, that resided in Phemiss, the capital city of New Plympto. He gladly accepted the offer and married Kelyn Flashheel, though he had to move into Phemiss and away from his clan. When he moved to Phemiss he signed on with the cities militia and worked his way up to being one of the militia's squad commanders. Even though he got proficient with blasters and rifles he would always carry a harvest blade on him as back up. He spent many nights on watch, or defending the city from Nosaurian raiders. It seemed to be a good life, until one night when he was out on patrol and the raiders decided to hit with a two pronged attack. The first attack was on a small village just outside of Phemiss and as his watch team was sent out to assist them the second attack happened and hit Phemiss before the rest of the militia could get up to alert status. They ended up defending against both attacks and pushing the raiders away, but there were plenty of casualties that were not avoided. Among those casualties were his own wife. After he got back home and saw what had happened in his own home he put in his resignation. He spent some time mourning his wife and everything he did just seemed to drone on and leave his life unfulfilled. He finally decided that he needed to leave New Plympto and try and start a new life. He caught word that a transport was looking to hire a few extra guards as they transported some medical equipment to Vanquo. He signed on and started his one way trip to his new life as a mercenary.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">KROZZ</span>** CL 7
**Medium Cathar Noble 1 / Jedi 3 /Soldier 3**
**Background:**
Krozz was born to nobility in the planet Cathar. At a young age, his aptitude with the Force was already evident. Though it pained his parents, he was sent to the Jedi Enclave of Dantooine for training. With his natural skill in stealth and his special way with people, the Jedi Council decided that it would be best to train him as a Jedi Sentinel under the careful tutelage of Arkanian Jedi Knight Jarig Zomn.
One night, Krozz was awakened by a nightmare of fire, blood and thunder. With sweat drenching his fur, he stared blankly at the wall trying to figure out the symbolism in his dream. When all communications with Cathar suddenly ceased, he had a hunch that it has something to do with his dream. Somehow, his entire race disappeared from the face of their planet. He asked around for intel and got answers from Ferroh, a fellow Cathar and Jedi who had spoken with several Cathar refugees who managed to flee the planet when the Mandalorians attacked. For two years, hoping that his family made it offworld, he tried in vain to sense them through the Force. Eventually, he had learned to accept their fate.
When the Jedi Council accepted the fact that the Revanchist Movement cannot be stopped, they determined that they need to send someone to infiltrate the organization to feed them information. Krozz was deemed the best candidate because of his race. Although not proven, many suspects that the Mandalorians caused the Cathar's disappearance. With the impending war, he received a crash course in infantry military training.
This mission is his final test for Knighthood. As a parting gift, his master bestowed upon him a Hurikane crystal for his lightsaber. His colleagues in the Technical Division gave him a modified Light Jedi Battle armor to increase his chance of survival in the upcoming war. To compensate for his lack of technical skills, he bought a MerenData S6-Series Security/Maintenance Droid which he fondly calls "SAM".
Upon his acceptance in the Revanchist Movement, he was immediately dispatched for a surveillance mission in the mining world of Vanquo.
**Appearance:**
Standing at 2 meters, Krozz is powerfully built yet moves with feline grace. Belonging to the less leonine appearing subspecies, he has short light brown skin hair and could pass as a human at quick glance.
He keeps his red mane long and braided.
During missions, he dons a streamlined Light Jedi Battle armor for both protection and to hide his identity.

</details>

Lonzo was a lad that just liked shooting, outdoors, sleeping under the stars. He learned hunting early on, got good with any range weapon he picked up, and started taking jobs that let him use his knowledge and skills to his advantage. Pairing his early education on planet with what the military (local militia) gave him, Lonzo rounded out his education as a shooter. But it wasn't all just shoot and no questions, Lonzo really did support law and order, legitimate authority, and defense of homeland. As the Mandalorian war brewed to its current level, Lonzo made sure he would be ready in whatever role he might be called.
Standing 2 meters tall, Lonzo Paden had brown hair, light brown eyes, and a tanned complexion. Clearly he was no stranger to working in the sun, or suns, as the case might be. He’d come to the mining colony of Vanqua seeking employment. He knew there were major corporations involved in the colony, and he wanted to get his foot in their door, hoping to move up in their organization. It was easy enough to get a passage here, half a dozen tourist ships made stops in Vanqua, and it was no real feat to just walk off the ship and seek new employment.
