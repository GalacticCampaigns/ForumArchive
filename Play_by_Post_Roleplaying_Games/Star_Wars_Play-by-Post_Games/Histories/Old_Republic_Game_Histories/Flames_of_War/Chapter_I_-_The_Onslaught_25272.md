# Chapter I - The Onslaught

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-01 01:40:32)

Vanquo. A small and rather insignificant colony on the Outer Rim, given any kind of importance only because it serves as a mining resource world for nearby Taris. Of course, it can also serve as a stop for people traveling in the area, but with the current disturbances, such traffic have decreased somewhat. It relative proximity to both Taris and Mandalore have made it a part of the defensive line drawn by republic forces, and as such a small detachment of Republic forces have been present for some weeks now. It hasn´t seen any real action though, and the increased number of people on the colony have only been appreciated by the owners of the few establishments apart from the mining complexes that Vanquo sports.
One such establishment is the *Borehole*, the local cantina owned by an aging Baragwin by the name of Lugum Mac. It is quite the complete cantina, walled together with a small gambling establishment owned by a cheap Toydarian called Ziszlac. Here miners, travelers, soldiers and anyone else who happens to find themselves on Vanquo can cut back and take a moment off from whatever they are currently doing.

He walks into the cantina and walks right up to the bar and taps on it with his clawed hand, to get the bartenders attention. When the bartender looks over at him he just simply says "**Syrspirit**" in basic and then waits for his drink to get handed to him.
**Description:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

He stands at 5' 6" and is 170lbs. His skin coloring is a dark green hue and he has light green eyes, and he has a light grey skin around his eyes. His face looks like that of the old English dragons and he has 6 horns that grow on top of his head, the center most two are longer than the others. Scratches can be seen on his horns and he has a long scar that runs from his forehead to his cheek and crosses over his left eye.

With the influx of people of all races in the sleepy backwater colony of Vanquo, Lonzo was glad he already had a room at the boarding house. The proprietress, a Durese woman of questionable morality, was quite pleasant and had no problem renting him a room. Well, it was a closet, if you really measured it. 2 meters wide, three deep. It had a bunk, a chest, and a good solid door with a lock. He had use of the communal refresher, although the sono-shower was less than he preferred. Sometimes it rattled his teeth a bit. He kept meaning to ask her if he could look at it, possibly fix it, but it seemed to be perpetually busy! Of course, he was assaulted by noise most of the night, it was a very busy place! But about half her customers were men like himself, and half were ladies of unquestionably lower repute.
But it was close to the gambling and drinking part of town, so there was endless ways to lose your credits. He had a bit of a nestegg from his last job, and now he was b'tween jobs, as it were. Thats where *Borehole* came in. A good place to meet someone for a job.
So off he went, as the sun dipped, to see what if anything new was going on in Vanquo.
Entering the cantina, Lonzo scanned for a booth, since no one could really do business at the bar. Too much elbowing and tempers and posturing for serious business there. Seeing a small table in the back corner, two chairs only, Lonzo moves across the room, avoiding stepping on toes literally or figuratively.
Once seated, he orders a local brewed ale, and angles his chair slightly, tipping it back, and taking a good look at the patrons tonight.
Appearance
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Standing 2 meters tall, Lonzo Paden had brown hair, light brown eyes, and a tanned complexion. Dressed in a leather vest, and a utility belt, he also had a cloak on, but pushed back and tied behind. Not trying to hide his holsters, ito the untrained eye it might seem odd that he had two different blasters, a larger one on the right and a slightly smaller one on the left. But to anyone knowing weapons, it was clear the larger was a blaster and the smaller an ion pistol.

Without much in terms of a mandate, Marti is free to her own devices as she waits transport back to Coruscant, or at least civilization in general. Vanquo is quaint, but not really the kind of place Marti likes to be. There isn't a lot to do here, aside from work or wait. She has no intention of finding a job outside of her normal avenues, so that left only waiting. The local watering hole, the *Borehole*, seems like as good a place as any to sit down while waiting for her ship to come in.
Entering the cantina, she was a little taken aback. It seems that her unusual tool of choice is quite prevalent on this colony. Then it dawns on her that it's original purpose is for mining. *Well, at least that should help me blend in a little.* she thinks as she sets down her hammer at her feet after she takes a seat at the bar. She orders a simple drink, paying in advance, then she turns to survey the other occupants of the establishment.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-03 17:07:34)

The massive Baragwin behind the bar looks at the Nosaurian for a moment, and then hands him his drink, mumbling something about how he can pay his tab when he leaves. The bartender doesn´t look like the sharpest tool in the shed, but looks can probably be deceiving. In any case, the mere size of the hunchbacked alien can probably make potential troublemakers think twice about causing a mess.
The cantina seems to have a healthy number of patrons this night, though unless you´re a regular it´s hard to know if it´s crowded or not. Apart from the Baragwin behind the bar and a few Twi'lek waitresses taking out orders to customers, the place seems to be lightly staffed. The patronage consists of a dozen or so humans, most dressed in what appears to be off-duty clothing of Republic personnel and the rest in mining uniforms. In addition, a small group of Gammoreans - also in mining uniforms - can be found in a booth off to the side, as well as a few Trandoshans and the rare sight of an Ughnaught outside of any kind of industrious workshop.
All in all, the place is rather quiet, though a few raised voices and exclamations can occasionally be heard from the open passage leading into the gambling establishment next door.

### **Redshaw** (2012-09-03 19:41:49)

Sentinel droids are not a rare sight in this part of the galaxy, more so on Taris itself rather than sister planets. Even still, on Vanquo, unless you're the suspicious sort, you're not likely to notice one and then not forget it forever within five seconds. And so it is that Vigilance has managed to go relatively unmolested for his three-day stake out of the mining planet's cantina. Established in a back corner of the bar, the droid has waited, watching and listening for tell of work worthy of his programmed caliber. It was an expensive business, chasing the shadows he did and for six galactic months his search had not yielded any fruit.
But it is in a Sentinel droid's programming to be patient and even with his newly-discovered sentience, he did not gawk at the prospect of waiting.
And so he stayed, keeping vigil, true to his namesake, and using the last of his financial means to pay for a bunkroom - which he did not need or use but for the fact that he found his long-standing presence unwelcome by the cantina's staff if he did not pay homage. Patience and a job would come. Patience and he would liberate his master.

### **Duggs** (2012-09-03 21:24:32)

He grabs his drink and then turns to look around the bar, sizing up those that looked capable of fighting. After looking around, and taking a couple of drinks from his pint he turns back to the Baragwin bartender. "**Anything interesting going on here? Besides mining that is.**"

### **KUPALISSSS** (2012-09-06 00:05:11)

The day is almost over as the setting sun casts long shadows of the trees and structures across the land. It reminded him of his home world. Sunset was the last memory he had of Cathar. Though he was very young when he was sent to Dantooine for Jedi training, he has held what little memories he had of home.
He had been in Vanquo for almost a week now, enough for him to get acclimated to the environs.
Krozz understands that being one of the newest members of the Jedi Crusaders is the reason why he was sent to Vanquo while almost everyone else went to Suurja.
*Like the old saying “Never send the rookies to the frontlines.”*, he thought.
Although he’s 21 years old, an adult by Cathar standards, he is still addressed as youngling by several long-lived masters. Come to think of it, to Master Vandar, everyone is a youngling. He can’t help but chuckle in his thought. While he has successfully finished several dangerous missions, he is not Knighted yet, hence, a Padawan. A rookie.
With the news that the Jedi Crusaders had been ambushed in Suurja, maybe it's being a rookie which saved him from whatever fate had befallen his comrades. It is in his hopes however, that this rookie would somehow make a difference.
*“Now, what is there to recon in this backwater planet?”* he thought to himself. *“If there’s a place where information is likely available, it’s the local alehouse.”* 
With that in mind, he headed for the Borehole cantina.
Krozz entered the cantina, passing by a hardy looking Nosaurian, and eased himself in one of the barstools. He positioned himself so he could keep an eye to the entrances and exits. As a precaution, he instructs his droid SAM to monitor the cantina’s exterior.
He orders the local version of Lomin ale and discretely looks around to size up the crowd, taking extra attention on the Ugnaught and Gammoreans.
He was about to call the Baragwin bartender’s attention when the Nosaurian asked the bartender **"Anything interesting going on here? Besides mining that is."**
*“Great! It seems someone will be doing my job for me.”* he said to himself while unobtrusively attempting to eavesdrop on the conversation.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-06 11:38:18)

The old bartender looks at the Nosaurian for a moment and then offers him a faint smile.
**"Ain´t nothing going on here on Vanquo besides mining son. But don´t let the seemingly simple nature of that task fool ya, mining is dangerous work, it is. You might think yourself all rough and tough, but when the stone worm closes his mouth around you, you will be gone unless you are prepared. I´ve seen many younglings like yourself get lost in those caves, thinking themselves capable of handling whatever they would find down there, going down without so much as a plasma torch. And don´t get me started on how many have fallen victims to the damn Laigreks infesting the lower levels. They set a charge, and boom, the blasted things are swarming over them…"**
Despite his self-imposed suggestion not to get him started on the subject, it seemed that the old Baragwin was indeed capable of keeping himself going for a seemingly indefinite amount of time once started. In fact, the large alien seemed quite content continuing the conversation all by himself, and began to wander off while still talking to himself, and Daegon could hear him still going on even as he entered one of the back rooms behind the bar disk.
For those with keen ears, muffled rumblings could be heard in the distance, suggesting that perhaps the choice to spend the night in the cantina had been a good one, unless one was interested in a completely different type of wet night.

---

### **Duggs** (2012-09-06 17:29:44)

He shakes his head slightly as the Baragwin walks away and he mumbles to himself, and those close to him could hear it to, "I'm not a miner... I wasn't taught to hunt so I could die defenseless in a pit..."
His ears have a slight twitch as the rain starts and he looks towards the nearest window so that he can see outside and he mumbles again "I have always liked the rain though." He goes back to his drink, and keeping on eye on the other patrons of the bar.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-11 20:36:28)

Indeed, it sounded to Daegin like a serious storm was coming in over the place. Just the perfect thing to set the mood for the lazy and silent night at the cantina. Still, as he took a sip of his drink and just listened to it for a moment, something didn´t feel right. Growing up on a planet where he lived relatively close to nature, something about this oncoming storm sounded...unnatural. His sensors showing differences in audio patterns from those of a typical storm, Vigilance experiences a similar observation.
As the distant rumblings slowly seems to grow in strength, both Krozz and Marti begin to feel a strange sensation through the Force that something is wrong. For a moment, the entire place grows silent (including the Baragwin owner), as the patrons seemed to try and focus on what it was they were hearing. Leaning back on his chair as he was, even Lonzo can feel a slight vibration under him.
Then suddenly something akin to a warning siren begin to sound over the small settlement, but it is almost immediately drowned by a series of rapid and loud explosions that illuminates and shatters most window in the cantina. Seconds later another pair of ear-shattering detonations sounds right above the ceiling, and in a shower of duracrete, plasteel and hot air, the central section of the roof blasts inwards, covering the area in a cloud of dust and smoke. The Gammoreans, finding themselves closest to this new air conditioning starts to scream and shout in their own guttural language as part of the debris showers over them.
Moments later, a massive droid-like apparatus crashes down through the hole, taking secure ground on mechanical legs. It is not obvious to just about anyone what it is, but the sight found atop the back of the machine is familiar to anyone, even those who haven´t even been close to the front. His armor glimmering in a red and gold hue, the distinct T-visor on the warriors helmet told everyone what they needed to know.
This was a Mandalorian attack.

He gets up off of his stool and covers his face some to help keep the debris from falling into his eyes. As soon as he sees the machine, and Mandalorian, touch down he lets out a loud roar and flashes his natural mouth light to try and get the Mandalorians attention. In the blink of an eye he seems to have his Assault blaster out and at the ready. (Using Quick Draw to draw my weapon.) He raises his weapon and squeezes the trigger to unleash his weapon on the Mandalorian.

Rolling out of his chair, Lonzo came up in a crouch, table turned up and used as his shield (cover), blaster in his hand (quick draw).
Looking through the dust and debris in the air, he sees what is clearly a 'target' and takes a steadied shot with his heavy blaster pistol.

Feeling a strange sensation through the Force like icy water trickling down his spine, Krozz was definite that something is not right.
Expecting trouble, he dons his helmet and draws his lightsaber expecting something to happen.
When the ceiling collapses and showers everyone with debris, he instinctively jumped over the bar to protect the elderly Baragwin from the flying duracrete and plasteel, his body acting as shield.
*“WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON!!!”* Krozz shouted in his thoughts. **“SAM, report! Initiate video feed!”** he blurted in his built-in helmet comm, deep inside, fearing for the welfare of his droid assistant.
When the droid mount bearing a Mandalorian warrior crashes down from the ceiling, Krozz pushes the barkeeper down and readies himself for combat.

### **Parmenter** (2012-09-12 11:40:09)

Marti listens in to the conversations near her, nothing of any importance, but enough information to make it worth her trouble. With slow movements she continues her drink, though, an unsettling feeling quickly takes hold.
As she focuses her attention on the feeling, the world suddenly grows eerie. Most of the conversations stop to better hear a new noise rising in the distance. A rumbling. She too, focuses her attention on it, listening as the volume increases. A vibration shakes the building and its occupants, it too increases its effect over time.
The sound of a siren in the distance interrupts the thickening atmosphere of the cantina. It brings the crowd back to reality, but only for a moment before several deafening explosions accompany outside, their concussions shattering the windows and raining glass on the occupants. Before anyone can react another explosion, this time much more local, breaks open the *Borehole*'s roof. Debris falls as everyone jumps to avoid it. Marti, like several others sitting at the bar, takes refuge behind the owner's barrier. Cover obtained, she glances over it to view the newest occupant. A mandalorian, riding atop what appeared to be a droid mount.
Marti curses at herself, realizing she'd left her hammer on the other side of the bar. It can't be helped, she's going to need it. Her blaster looks horribly outmatched against an armored duo such as this. When the moment seems right, Marti jumps over the bar to retrieve her hammer.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-13 00:21:33)

One would think a crashed roof would cause some measure of chaos in the cantina, and especially so when the reason is an attack by a massive war machine ridden by a known enemy. The shouting Gammoreans actually gets silenced as the big droid comes crashing down, and stand off in their little booth, hesitating for a few moments about what to do. Two who don´t waste any time acting are the Cathar and the blue-skinned human standing near the bar, and they both quickly vault over the bar to take cover.
Daegin, on the other hand, takes a more defiant stance against the newcomer, pulling up his rifle and firing a shot against the armored warrior on top of the battle droid. Despite the target being somewhat shielded by the large legs of its mount, the Nosaurian manages to score a hit that takes the opponent on the upper half of a chest plate, and as it connects it create a burst of sparks across a blue hue covering the armor. The joy is short-lived though as the blast seemed to have done less than no damage, and if Daegin could have seen the face of his enemy, he feels certain that he would have seen a big grin.
Commanding his mount with experienced hands, the Mandalorian warrior turns it slightly towards Daegin and the others at the bar, giving them a much better view of the array of lethal weaponry in its front. With only a soft mechanical clicking as waring, Daegin throws himself to the side as the opponent open fire, spraying the bar with crimson bolts. Miraculously though he manages to avoid being hit, but as he scrambles to catch his bearings again, he notices that the bar is now significantly smaller than before. Behind the bar, Krozz and the somewhat stunned Baragwin now finds themselves completely open as well.
Shocked off his chair, Lonzo kicks the small table he was sitting at over to create some sort of cover for himself, coming up behind it with blaster in hand. Taking less than careful aim he fires a shot at the droid in the center of the room, but the blast disperses harmlessly against the thick armor. As the metallic beast takes a croaking step forward towards the people at the bar, roaring sounds can be heard coming closer to the hole in the roof. Moments later, two more armored warriors descends carried on jetpacks, with rifles firing into the section where the mining personnel was seated, dropping one of the Gammoreans to the ground.
((
OK, since Redshaw have said that his activity might be a little low for some time here, I rolled initiative for him and resolved the round up to that count - which just happened to be the last count in the round =P
I´ll be giving Redshaw some time to make a post, but will make one for him if nothing comes up, to keep the pace going. You can go ahead and post your actions for round 2 if you want to. I´ll resolve it as it comes up.

Lonzo Paden cursed silently under his breath. *That's the last time I feel bored! The alternative seems a bit too much!* 
Not too happy about his first shot, the human could only watch in dread as the next two Mandalorians dropped into the bar, *a la*  the new hole in the roof, firing somewhat indiscriminately, although with deadly aim. Remaining behind the cover his table provided, Lonzo took aim again, hoping to do a better job, this time at the closest jetpack flyer.

***27*** <- [17] 1d20 + 10

Damage

***17*** <- [3, 5, 6] 3d8 + 3

And thinking to himself as he let off the blast, *This fight isn't going to end well, I just know it.*

### **Duggs** (2012-09-13 18:37:08)

The Nosaurian shakes his head slightly as his shots don't even phase the Mandalorian. "**Why don't you get out of that machine and fight me like a man!?! Did your mother let you suckle at her tit for too long!?!**" he decides to yell at the driver as he regains his bearings from the first shots the Mandalorian lays down, even though he spots two other viable targets for him to mess with. After he yells he looks the Mandalorian right in the T-Visor, and hopefully his eyes, and snarls as he raises his rifle to fire again.
After he fires his rifle he looks over at the bar, noticing that a good chunk of it is gone, and yells to the bartender, and the Cathar. "**You might want to move!**"

### **KUPALISSSS** (2012-09-14 10:43:16)

With their cover obliterated into nothingness, Krozz hesitated on what to do.
He is a warrior, born from a species reknowned for their strength, agility and martial prowess. The very reason why the Mandalorians attacked them during the Great Sith War. They provided a great challenge to the war-loving people.
However, he is also a Jedi. Though trained in combat as a youngling, he was also taught to honor life, render aid and defend the weak. Krozz knows he has to act to secure the safety of the shocked Baragwin.
Here is his chance to get even with the people whom he suspects as the reason for the disappearance of his race.
But revenge is not the Jedi way. Saving lives should take precedence.
His internal batlle was interrupted by the yell of the Nosaurian  **"You might want to move!"**.
Snapping out of his musings, **"Aye! I will be back!"** Krozz shouted in reply, while hastily dragging the elderly Baragwin to the next room through the doorway behind the smoldering bar, extremely wary of any incoming attacks.

Marti cowers at the sound of destruction, then quickly surveys it's aftermath. Further down the bar others using it for cover are now visibly in the open. She hears the faint sound of a conversation taking place, then watches the two scurry off to find more cover. The event showed her the futility of using this bar to defend herself. It seemed, in this case, that offense might be the best defense.
Separated from her weapon of choice, Marti sees no other option than to abandon her cover to retrieve it. It would likely make her a target, and force her to join those putting up some resistance. That wasn't necessarily against Marti's thinking, just she hadn't counted on something like this when the day began. With little hesitation, Marti vaults the bar once again, bringing back into the open. Staying low to the ground she retrieves her item and activates it.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-17 15:24:32)

Seeing a segment of the bar she had been using for cover get blown completely away, Marti decides that taking the offense would likely be the best defense, and so she waits for an opening in the fire and vaults back over it. Landing pretty much right where she had left her weapon against the bar, she grabs the hammer and engages its power source.
One of the two newly arrived troopers continues to pour lethal blasterfire into the ranks of scrambling mining workers, and two more goes down. The second trooper on the other hand notices that some o the other residents in the bar seems to be mounting somewhat of a resistance. Walking purposefully and determined out from behind the massive war droid, he fires a steady stream of blaster bolts down towards Lonzo in his corner, forcing the soldier to hunker down behind the turned over table to avoid being hit.
Scrambling back to his feet, Daegin cries out to the Mandalorian warrior, only to be barely heard over the firefight, and fires his rifle again. The shifting parts of the droid and the protective shield of the pilot makes hitting hard though, and his shots misses their target. The Mandalorian warrior seems unaffected by the taunt, or perhaps he simply enjoys toying with his prey. A slight whirring sound reveals the charging of another pair of cannons, and gives Daegin just enough time to once again dive out of the way as a massive energy pulse blasts by him and leaving a large scorching mark in the wall behind him.
With their only cover blown away, Krozz gets to his feet and grabs the Baragwin bartender by the clothes, intent on pulling him into the cover of the back room. The elder alien limps quickly along, and the two moves into the space behind the bar, a small all-purpose storage what it seems, with shelves lined with a little bit of this and a little bit of that. The room however, is lacking any kind of opening into the outside world. The Baragwin though, seems resolute as he begins to dig among the shelves for something.
Pulling up from behind his cover, Lonzo watches the Mandalorian warrior walk boldly out into the cantina, coming straight at him. Taking careful aim, he lines up a shot that strikes the oncoming foe straight in the gut, and a fieldof blue energy seems to pulsate across the armor plating as the warrior shrugs back from the attack.
Suddenly a stream of energy burst forth from the droid that had been sitting silently to the side of the show. It´s sensors gathering analysis and pinpointing weaknesses, the brilliant stream of blaster bolts cut straight into the mass of feeding tubes connecting the droids armaments to its body, and a shower of sparks and flames erupted from the machine.
((
OK, so that´s the combined resolution of round 1 remainder and round 2. Round 3 is now up.
Just for information, the exit of the cantina is located behind those around the bar, reachable in a double move, while those who are a little more spread out (Lonzo, Vigilance) have a slightly longer way there. Image a square map if you will, then the exit is on the middle-left, and the entrance to the casino area is on the opposite. The back room in up-left, with the bar kind of in between it and the exit, a little out from the left wall. The Mandalorians are pretty much in the middle, and Lonzo and Vigilance occupies tables along the down side.
Did that make any sense? <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

He looks at the Mandalorian as his shots miss and then he just smiles at him with an evil looking smile and then raises his rifle as he aims and fires again. Other than his dodging away from the droids shots he makes no attempt to move for cover. He does not want a Mandalorian to think that he fears him, in fact he is rather enjoying his fight with this battle armor.

Lonzo, seeing the flare of a personal shield, begins to think he's out classed in this fight. *Come play without your shield, some time, little boy.* 
Using a quick sprint, Lonzo will make it about halfway to the back exit, bringing his dash to a halt behind another overturned table. Hastily lining up another shot, he'll put another round on the jetpack owner with the personal shield, *Maybe, just maybe, it can be overloaded with multiple hits…*

Bringing her hammer up, Marti swings it back in preparation for her attack. If she can engage one of the warriors on foot, she should be able to use him as cover from any others who might decide she looks like a worthwhile target. Bothered by what is likely going on outside the cantina, she convinces herself that the virtue in attacking at this time is to open a window for others to escape. Marti springs forward toward the trooper on foot, she makes her moves erratic to add confusion into the equation.

Finally having her weapon back, Marti decides to go on the offensive, and as one of the Mandalorian warriors begin to walk out across the room she sees an opportunity to get the enemy good from behind. Hammer trailing behind her to gain momentum, she begins to pick up speed with a short sprint when she is suddenly made painfully aware of the full extent of the capacities of the Mandalorian War Droid. Diving down into a roll in the last second, she barely avoids getting her head clipped of as one of its massive legs makes a horizontal sweep against her. Coming up quickly enough, she still manages to maintain enough of her momentum to swing her weapon at the soldier. Reacting too late, the warrior staggers off balance for a second, and even though his elbow comes around fast and hard, Marti manages to deflect it with the handle of her weapon.
With Daegin making his defiant stance near what now remains of the bar, it is hard to tell if the faceless warriors are getting irritated, or if they are simply equally amused as he is and just playing with him. The second soldier on foot engages his jetpack again and rises up behind his mounted ally, raining red bolts down toward the Nosaurian, one of them even gracing the shoulder of his armor as he dodges to the side. Raising his own rifle and taking another shot, he finds that once again the force field surrounding the mounted warrior dissipates all the energy of his attack. Defiant and enjoying himself as he might be, the tide will turn against him soon unless he figures something out.
Leaving the Baragwin in the relative safety of the back room, Krozz moves back out into the main area, calling upon the Force to grant him strength. Igniting his lightsaber, he manages to catch the eye of the mounted warrior, much to Daegins fortune, as the warrior attempts to redirect his weapons attack to the Jedi while already having engaged them. Powerful bolts of superheated energy streaks barely out of the way of Daegin, this time leveling the already weakened wall behind the to the ground by the sheer force of the assault, widening the exit of the cantina by a few meters.
Recognizing when to withdraw is the mark of a good soldier, and both Lonzo and Vigilance have made that assessment now, both getting up from their respective locations and beginning to move for the exit. Firing as he moves, Lonzo finds it hard to aim properly, and his shots goes wide of his Mandalorian assailant, who on the other hand is now ore closely engaged in hand-to-hand combat by the blue-skinned female. Vigilance, with his advanced targeting and tracking systems finds moving accuracy easier to come by as he sends another stream of shots into the War Droids side. Unfortunately, he misses the more vulnerable wiring this time, and his shots slam harmlessly into the armored side of the machine.
((
Marti takes 17 damage. Moving to the Mandalorian provoked an AoO, and since you specified you wanted to reach him I didn´t make a Tumble check, as that would have cost too much movement unless you also made a charge, and I didn´t want to make that choice for you.
Also, in case you want to know who we are waiting for to post, here is your initiative order:
Marti
Daegin
Krozz
Lonzo
Vigilance

*Quit trying to have fun with this war droid. I am going to get myself killed. Today is not my day to die.*
He reaches up to his rifle and switches it over to autofire mode and releases a hail of bolts onto the war droid, hoping there is something that he can hit to finally cause some damage.

Seeing a steady but ineffective defense being put up by a few in the bar, either trying to get out or protect those unarmed, Lonzo can only think this isn't going to come out any way we're likely to be happy about.
So at the next opportunity the lanky lad will move from his crouch behind cover, and sprint to the back door (opening?) and again crouch behind cover. It was little enough and only barely protecting him. He thought more they just didn't consider him a threat, and so hadn't become the focus of their weapons (yet).
Firing at that same jet pack flyer, Lonzo hopes less to actually get past the shield than just to provide some cover so others could also get out of this particular killing ground.

Just after the Nosaurian showered the the warrior and its mount with a hail of blaster fire, Krozz sprinted towards the droid and rider. Tumbling infront of the massive metal frame, he stepped on the droid's right leg. With grace associated with their race, the Cathar pushed himself up towards the hulking head bristling with cannons and deftly landed on the right of the Mandalorian rider. With a forceful thrust, Krozz stabs the Mandalorian at the side with his lightsaber.

Marti is taken aback by the martial prowess of the droid mount filling up the room. Saving her life at the cost of some speed felt like a fair trade, but it cost her some of the damage she had hoped to inflict up the jet pack infantry. He quickly retaliates, but she manages and artful parry with her cumbersome weapon. Spinning away from the warriors attack, Marti uses the momentum gained and takes another swing at her foe. During her spin, Marti takes note of the rest of the room. The sound of a lightsaber activating fills her with a small sense of relief, perhaps the Council knew of this attack and sent reinforcements prematurely. That single thought manages to fill Marti with the most precious and terrible of things, hope. Continuing to look, she sees the others putting up resistance seem to be holding their own. As her hammer comes to the end of its rotation Marti closes her eyes and allows the force to flow through her into the hammer.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-01-29 14:34:19)

As Krozz prepares to take his massive charge up against the massive war droid, he feels a powerful hand on his shoulder as someone pulls him backwards and towards the exit.
**"Get out of here!"**
The elderly Baragwin shoots the young Cathar a quick glance, and the Jedi can sense a feeling of fierce determination from the alien. A feeling that he can discern the source from as he notes the Baragwin is carrying something in his hands that he took from the back room. Raising a massive metal tube to his shoulder, he gives the Baragwin equivalent of a wide grin.
**"Take this you metal freaks""**
With a deafening blast, he fires the weapon and sends its massive payload straight towards the Basilisk rider. Still engaged in the seat, he is unable to even move and desperately grabs for the hand of his flying companion, but grabs it too late. The missile blasts square into the massive war droid, most likely hitting something vital made vulnerable by the assaults against it, and the resulting chain reaction engulfs the machine and the two Mandalorians in a ball of flames and sends shrapnel flying everywhere. Grabbing the Nosaurian soldier as he moves, Krozz half-dives out from the cantina, and in the corner of his eye he can see a human - armed - make a run for it along the wall of the cantina.
Marti swings her hammer around at about the same time as the big droid explodes, and the sudden distraction allows her to strike her opponent square in the back, nearly knocking him over. Dodging to the side as a piece of metal flies past her, she decides to make a run for it, and sets off for the exit. Outside, she finds the Baragwin bartender and a trio of odd fellows - two soldiers, a Human and a Nosaurian, as well as a Cathar jedi, judging by the lightsaber in his hand. While the turmoil of the invasion still rages around them, they seems to have found a most temporary calm in the storm.
((
OK, so that´s some pseuso-playing to get the story moving again. Anyone who wishes to stay on board can just pick up where we left off. If I see we´re too few, I might open a casting for a few more players, but it seems that most of you have been logging in somewhat recently at least, so I´m hoping to keep the majority at least.
))

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-01-31 00:10:43)

Krozz addresses the Baragwin. **“Thanks a lot! Nice piece of equipment you have there!”** looking at the rocket launcher. He then looks around at the chaos caused by the invasion and nods an acknowledgement to the approaching woman wielding a huge maul.
Returning his attention to the barkeep, **“Any chance you have a place where we can hide and plan on our next course of action?”**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-01-31 04:49:26)

Despite the fact that he was in a war zone, the elderly Baragwin did seem to smile a bit. He looked at the weapon in his hand and then threw it aside on the ground.
**"My people aren´t known as great armscrafters for nothing. Single-shot though, unfortunately"**
Turning his massive frame around, he pointed towards a large, artificial opening into the hills surrounding the local settlement about a kilometer away.
**"I think our best bet is to head for the mines. This place is just made for some recreation for the miners, it´s not built with defense in mind, especially not against an assault on this scale"**

---

### **Parmenter** (2013-02-01 01:54:16)

Quickly, Marti returns her hammer to the strap on her back. **"Running and hiding sounds like a perfectly sound plan for the moment. As for our next course of action I think it should be to alert the Republic of this attack. Any thoughts on how?"**

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-02-01 03:03:28)

**"It did a hell of a great job nonetheless!"** Krozz exclaimed to the elder Baragwin.
Shifting his gaze at the woman, **"Well, I’m sure the Republic is aware of this assault, and by the scale of this, most likely, the detachment here had been overrun.”**
Looking back at the Bragwin, **“Are you aware of how many entrance the mines have? I’m really considering it as a temporary base of operations. However, I’d hate to be trapped there when things go south. If that be the case, I think we’re better off in the woods."**
 **“Still, I’m open to suggestions.”** looking at the others present.
**“And I suggest we hurry.”**his gaze wanders off wary of trouble.

---

### **Duggs** (2013-02-01 13:12:11)

He gives the Baragwin a nod since he saved them from the fight in the bar, though he would never actually admit he needed to be saved.
He seems to growl at the mention of heading to the mines and he mumbles. "**Defenseless in a pit…**"
He looks around at the group and then back at the Baragwin. "**There isn't anywhere that would be better for defending? i guess it could work if there weren't too many entrances into the place, though if we could draw them into the woods we could employ guerrilla tactics and slowly whittle away at their numbers.**"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-02-02 06:56:34)

The Baragwin shakes his head when Krozz asks him about the number of entrances to the mines.
**"I´m just a bartender, and miners tend to be tired of talking about their work when they come to see me. I know that one is the main one, large enough to get vehicles and such a ways down, but there might be others as well"**
He looked at Daegin with some skepticism.
**"You want to take on a Mandalorian invasion force, be my guest. Personally I just want to find a way out of here. If what I´ve heard about them is true, they´re bringing enough power to destroy this place rather than take it"**

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-02-04 12:18:05)

**"The possibility that the mines have other exits gives us hope that should the Mandos decide to attack it, we have a chance for escape."** Krozz replied to the Baragwin's statement.
**"SAM, conduct a search in the Borehole for survivors."**, Krozz issued a subvocal command to his droid via his commlink while the barkeeper is speaking to the Nosaurian. **"And keep the video feed coming."**, he added.

---

### **Duggs** (2013-02-04 19:24:47)

He looks at the Baragwin and the others. "**If I die in this pit I will make sure to take each of you with me.**" He seems to growl at the end of his statement.
*It would be very defensible, and it is a good place to stage a fight, but I do not want to be buried in the ground and forgotten.*
"**What is the plan? Do we have someone coming in for pick up, or are we stuck fighting until we starve?**"

---

### **Parmenter** (2013-02-05 12:03:45)

Marti's eyes shift from one person to another as they speak. It seems like they all agree on the mines, but none will give the final push to take that course of action until they've come to a consensus on what to do after that. Marti has no such sense of protocol and debate. Unstrapping her sidearm, she offers it to the seemingly unarmed bartender.
Not wanting to be in charge, but wishing to usher some action into her new 'friends,' she decides to voice her opinion. **"This place won't remain safe long. It sounds like we all agree on the mines as our next rally point. We should leave soon and work out the next step after we arrive."**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-02-06 18:57:40)

As if to emphasize Martis point, a deafening explosion erupts nearby, reminding anyone that might have forgotten it that they are in the middle of a war zone. A quick look around revealed a number of the massive Basilisks walking in the settlement, firing seemingly at random, though on occasion they seemed to be targeting some locals. Further towards the center of the settlement, a few landing shuttles could be seen, swarming with Mandalorian soldiers.

---

### **Duggs** (2013-02-06 19:59:00)

He looks around real quick and takes a count of the Mandalorian numbers.
*There are too many. We can't take them on at all.*
"**Maybe I was wrong with saying we should try and ambush them to thin their numbers. We need to get to those mines now.**"
He started making his way towards the entrance to the mines.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-02-08 05:53:21)

**“You proceed to the mines and I’ll follow you there later.”** Krozz said to the group.
**“I think I may have an idea that may be our ticket out of here.”** he added before turning his back from his newly found allies to disappear into the shadows of the derelict bar.
From the video feed provided by his probe droid SAM, Krozz pinpointed with a modicum of accuracy the downed Mandalorian soldier’s location.
Quickly yet warily, Krozz approached the lone Mandalorian lying on the floor to confirm it's status.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-02-08 15:44:35)

Walking into the cantina, Krozz easily spot the lone Mandalorian warrior lying where he had been dropped after his skirmish with Marti, face-down on the floor. He is not moving.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-02-09 15:46:47)

Krozz orients his approach such that he'll be coming from the Mandalorian's foot. He presses one knee on his fallen enemy's back ready to apply additional pressure should it still be alive and put up a fight.

---

### **Duggs** (2013-02-10 11:33:31)

He shakes his head as Krozz runs off.
He then looks back at the rest of the group. "**We need to get moving so we can get defensive positions set up.**"
He starts making his way towards the mines.

---

## Hi Ho... Hi Ho...

### **Parmenter** (2013-02-10 19:39:07)

Marti starts to speak up as the cathar begins walking away, but he quickly moves out of view. He hadn't left his name or some way to get a hold of him should their plans change.
She looks to the others, the horned lizard seems bothered by the cathar's sudden departure as well. He speaks up, urging the group to continue to the mines as they had discussed. Without hesitation he takes off in the direction the bartender had said. Marti watches the nosaurian lead the way and then shortly follows suit.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-02-10 22:15:44)

As Krozz presses down on the fallen warrior, he still doesn´t move.
Following behind the Nosaurian warrior, Marti, and the rest of the small group heads off towards the entrance of the mines. They were in the more remote portion of the settlement, and the buildings were spaced more widely apart than those on the lower ground, making shelter slightly harder to find. On the other hand, the surrounding forest had been allowed to grow a little wilder and closer, so by sticking close to the edge, they were able to get themselves some protection.
Moving quickly, the small group manages to avoid detection as they approach the large circular structure that marks the entrance into the mining tunnels. They halt at the tree line just above the top of the slope leading down into the basin where it is located. Looking out over the scene ahead, they will have to pass at least two hundred meters of open ground before reaching the opening.
Apparently interested in the mines, they can spot four Mandalorian soldiers hauling a pair of heavy crates towards the entrance, with two more soldiers walking next to them keeping watch. The soldiers are about as far away from the group as the entrance, and doesn´t appear to have seen them.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-02-11 04:12:08)

Seing that the Mandalorian does not flinch despite the pressure applied to his back, Krozz, cautiously removes the fallen soldier’s helmet. Lacking any medical skill, he then removes his left glove, exposing his finely pelaged hand and places it near the Mandalorian’s nose to feel any indication of breathing.
**“SAM, stay outside and be on the lookout. Notify me immediately if somebody approaches. Keep the video feed active.”** Krozz commanded his probe droid as an additional precaution.
Intending to use the Mandalorian’s armor as a disguise to grant his newfound group a chance for escape, he pulls the vanquished foe towards the cantina’s backroom and systematically removes the Mandalorian’s armor, always alert should the downed foe suddenly springs back to action.
*“I hope you won’t mind me borrowing your armor for a while. I don’t think you would have much use for it anyway.”* he whispered to the unmoving warrior.
Krozz couldn’t find it in his heart to feel pity on the fallen foe. He belongs to the warrior race that are suspected of eradicating his race.
He takes off his Jedi armor and replaces it with that of the Mandalorian’s. Activating the internal comlink of the assault armor's helmet, he includes the comcode of his Droid then attempts to eavesdrop on the Mandalorian's communications in the hopes of gleaning useful information. Grabbing a bag from the shelves, Krozz stashes his Jedi armor inside.
Receiving no warning from his droid, he looks through its camera feed to be sure no one can see him before exiting the building to head off to the mines to rendezvous with his allies.

---

### **Duggs** (2013-02-24 00:17:52)

He grumbles as they spot the soldiers near the entrance.
*Nothing can ever be easy. We are not prepared for a fight over open ground.*
He looks around to try and find any advantage they can use, other than surprise, which they clearly have. He shoulders his rifle and looks over the soldiers and their crate with his targeting scope.
"**Do you guys think you are ready to take these guys down, and possibly grab the attention of their friends?**"

---

### **Parmenter** (2013-02-25 23:03:12)

Marti frowns at the sight of mandalorians on their desired route. The nosaurian speaks up first.
> **&quot;Do you guys think you are ready to take these guys down, and possibly grab the attention of their friends?&quot;**

**"It's not them that I'm concerned with, it's the others back at the settlement that are sure to come with they call for assistance."** She says, offering her answer to the question. **"That being said, I don't see a lot in the way of alternatives either. That is unless we want to go see what that Jedi had in mind? Probably involves getting us transport off this rock."**
Marti grabs the hammer from her back and tightens her hands around its handle. **"I'll follow your lead, because it seems like the only chance we have is to work together."**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-02 09:53:21)

While being far more uncomfortable than he is used to, Krozz straps on the Mandalorian armor - noting some added discomfort from a slight dent in one side of the plating, most likely courtesy of Martis hammerstrike earlier - and heads cautiously outside to catch up with his newfound allies. Moving quickly he manages to avoid detection by any invading troopers as he makes his way towards the mines.
Meanwhile, the rest of the group are preparing to ambush the Mandalorian warriors approaching the mines when Marti suddenly reacts to something coming up behind them. Turning quickly around, she spot a lone Mandalorian warrior approaching among the trees, carrying a shoulder bag.

### **Parmenter** (2013-03-05 10:12:13)

Marti senses something approaching the group from the rear and turns around to find a mandalorian, alone and seemingly without a weapon. ***Curious.*** Marti brings her hammer close to her chest, should she need to start running. With slight hesitation, not completely unfounded given the mandalorians reputation, she addresses the lone warrior. **"You seem to be missing something, mandalorian. What good is a warrior without his weapon?"**

The weapon could be in the bag, but that seems like a rather slow place to arm himself from. She stands her ground waiting for the unknown to make the first move.

---

### **Duggs** (2013-03-05 16:26:07)

He shoulders his rifle and takes aim through his scope. He hesitates to fire because they would then lose the element of surprise.
*I will have to wait or him to get close before I can attack, though he does not know that.*
He keeps his weapon shouldered as he says to Marti. "**We don't have time to toy with these Mandalorians.**"

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-03-06 12:41:08)

Krozz was a bit startled when he heard Marti's voice. More startling still was the blaster rifle held by the Nosaurian trained upon him.
He froze on his tracks.
**"Ease up on the trigger Nosaurian! It is I, the Cathar!"** Krozz exclaimed in a controlled voice, just loud enough for the group to hear.
Slowly removed his helmet to reveal his identity, making sure everyone could see. Promptly, he refastens his helmet back in place and approached the group.

---

### **Duggs** (2013-03-07 16:57:15)

He lowers his weapon and sits there glaring at the Cathar.
"**Are you trying to get yourself killed? We were ready to take you down.**"
*This crazy kid is going to get himself killed if he isn't careful. I wonder what he is planning on doing wearing that armor.*

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-03-09 08:45:54)

**"Sorry about that!"** Krozz speaking through his helmet's external speakers.
**"I'm trying to buy our tickets out of this rock."** he added, taking notice of the Mandalorians near the entrance of the mine.
**"By the way, I am Krozz. I believe we now have time to introduce ourselves and to exchange our comcodes if we are to act as a team."**
**"Anyway, here's my plan. With this armor, I intend to masquerade as one of them."**, Krozz looks at the Mandalorians near the mine. **"I am capable of speaking Man'doa so hopefully I can play the role right. If you would agree, I'll take you two as my prisoner so we can get inside the cave and find out what they're doing there."**
**"As to why I'm taking you two inside the mines is the part I haven't thought of yet. Any ideas?"**
**"If you would like to suggest an alternative plan, I'd like to hear them."** the Cathar added.

---

### **Duggs** (2013-03-12 18:09:47)

"**I am not sure. This plan seems faulty.**" He stands there for a second thinking about their situation.
*I don't really have a better idea, and we can't risk fighting them because then we risk alerting their friends.*
"**My name is Daegin. You could always say that you chased us into the woods and captured us trying to get to the mines. That would give some explanation as to why we are up here.**"
He looks down at the shackles and then back up at Krozz. "**If you are thinking of putting those on me then you had better have a way for me to get back out, without relying solely on you.**"

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-03-13 12:13:08)

**"I'm honored to meet you Daegin!"**, Krozz nods at the Nosaurian in acknowledgment.
**"Also, I know my plan isn't foolproof which is precisely why I am asking you all for alternative ideas."**, he continued while regarding everyone.

---

## Hi-Ho or Ho-Hum, that is the question.

### **Parmenter** (2013-03-15 20:57:01)

**"Marti Quintaine, operative for the Order, Master Jedi, Daegin."** Marti introduces herself in turn, then ponders the plans laid before them. **"I agree with Daegin, that we need some sort of explanation as to why you'd be bringing us to this mine. And from our previous brawl at the *Borehole*, it didn't seem like they were keen on taking prisoners."** Marti looks between the two who have stepped forward to lead. She believes their best option is to attack head on and find a way off this rock, though she feels she might have a hard time convincing the others. Her point from before still stands, their only chance comes from the group working together. **"Whatever we do, we need to do it quickly. The longer we wait the more fortified they will become."**

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-03-18 15:54:57)

**"Well met Marti Quintaine!** Krozz addressed the female, his voice slightly raised over the helmet speaker upon learning that another from the Order was present.
Speaking to the group, **"Perhaps we could claim that you two belong to the security force here in Vanquo and have vital information on the troop count and locations."**
**"As an alternative, we could wait up a bit and hope that we can tackle the enemy when their numbers becomes more manageable. I don't think the three of us could take six fully armored Mandalorians right now. With the element of surprise, perhaps we can. Besides, engaging them head on runs the risk that they call for backup."**, Krozz, glances at the Mandalorians to confirm if their numbers stayed the same.
**"Again, if you have an idea, air it out."**, Krozz said to no one in particular.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-19 19:56:32)

Casting a glance over at the Mandalorians, Krozz don´t see any additional warriors. The small group makes their way forward towards he mine entrance, hauling heir cargo along.
Standing over with the Baragwin bartender, the human soldiers have produced a pair of electrobinoculars and is keeping closer watch over the soldiers.
**"Guys, I´m with our blue-skinned friend here. I don´t know what they´re up to, but those definitely looks like munitions crates they´re hauling"**

---

### **Duggs** (2013-03-20 14:41:45)

He looks between those that are talking as he thinks.
*Those munitions crates could come in handy if we can get control of them.*
"**Taking us in as prisoners might work. You could say that we are Republic soldiers that happen to have information on an outpost outside of the settlement. That might let us get close enough to take them down without raising the alarm.**

---

### **Parmenter** (2013-03-21 09:58:59)

**"Yes, I agree with that scenario."** Marti chimes in with her opinion. **"It might distract them just wondering how you, by yourself, captured all of us."**
Marti looks around the group once more, **"I guess I only have one more question. Are we all in, or do we leave someone behind in case something goes wrong? I still think we need to stick together, it offers the most chance of success."** Marti pulls her multi-tool from her pocket, and slips it into her boot. Hopefully it'll remain hidden there should they need it.
Stealth to hide the tool.

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-03-22 14:51:09)

Krozz, unslings his shoulder bag and stashes it in the bushes, taking note of its location for ease of retrieval.
Content that it’s sufficiently hidden, he reverts his attention back to group.
“**I suggest we leave him..”** looking at the human soldier. **“..and the Bargwin here to warn us if more Mandos are entering the mines.”** 
**“Judging from his gear..,”** eyeing the soldier’s rifle and electrobinoculars, **“I believe he could assist us from this distance should things not go as planned.”**
**“That said, if everyone agrees to the plan..”,** Krozz produces a liquid cable dispenser from his utility belt and hands it to his companions. **“…be the ones to restrain yourselves. Just to be sure I don't put it too tightly”**
Addressing Marti and Daegin, **“I’ll be needing your obvious weapons.”**, extending his arms to receive the requested items. **“I’ll throw them back to you once we close in to melee range.”** he added.
**“Mister Barkeep! If Daegin be willing to lend you his blaster rifle, I suppose you can handle it as well as you did with the missile launcher.”**, the Cathar’s statement directed at the Baragwin."
Looking at the soldier and the Baragwin, **“When I ignite my lightsaber, be prepared. Once I drop Marti’s and Daegin’s weapons, that’s your cue to attack. Target the rear guards since they are the ones prepared for combat.”**
**“The three of us will handle those carrying the crates while they are distracted.”**
**“Honestly, I’m in a bit of disadvantage here as I can hardly move in this damned armor, but that’s a price I’m willing to pay to grant us the element of surprise.”**
**“If we play our cards right, we might just live through this encounter.”**, Krozz concluded.
Before anyone could react, Krozz closes his eyes and lets the Force flow through his body, becoming one with it, observing in his inner mind the ripples on reality his actions would cause.

He unslings his rifle and extends it out towards the Baragwin. He seems to snarl at relinquishing his weapon. The name "Kelyn" can be seen scratched on the side of the rifle.
"**Id you damage it I will come back here just to murder you.**"
He then hands his vibro-ax to Krozz. After the weapons have been handed off he takes the liquid cable and ties up his hands. He holds the slack of the cable in his palms so that the cable looks tight, but he can still easily get out of it.
"**If the fight breaks out before we are expecting do not worry about getting my ax to me. My claws and horns have aided me in besting many brave warriors. I am sure they can help drop a few mandos.**"
A small smile creeps out, and it is the first time a smile has been seen thus far.

As Daegin goes about explaining what will happen to whomever breaks his rifle, Marti starts removing things that might seem out of place on a prisoner. Her utility belt, the strap for her hammer, her comm and holster for her pistol. Each piece she removes she places in the care of the soldier being left behind. She still has her contact stunner holstered on the small of her back. She feels vulnerable, but understands the plan and what needs to happen. She double checks the stunner to make sure it is well hidden, then proceeds to tie herself up with the cable handy. With her hands bound, she hands the slack left to the Jedi as a leash.
As she approaches the armor clad cathar she notices a dent in his armor, noticeably to her it appears to be about the size and shape of her hammer. **"If you take that armor off, I should be able to straighten out the dent."** She offers, as she reclaims her hammer from the soldier. **"Shouldn't take much time at all. Certainly didn't take much time to make it."**

**"Sure!"**, Krozz replied as he deftly unfastens the front breast plate of the Mandalorian Assault Armor he's wearing then hands it to Marti.

Both the human soldier and the Baragwin barkeep gives the small group of people behind them a confused look, but remains ever vigilant towards the Mandalorian soldiers and their activities. The troopers have now reached the entrance to the mines, and have started to unload the crates just inside the tunnel entrance, making it hard to see exactly what they are doing. Two of the soldiers remain outside the tunnel, keeping watch.
