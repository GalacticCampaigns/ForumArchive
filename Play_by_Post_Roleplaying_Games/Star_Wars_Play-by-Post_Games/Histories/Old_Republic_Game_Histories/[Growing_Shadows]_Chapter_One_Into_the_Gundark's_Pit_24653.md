# [Growing Shadows] Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Alicia** (2010-05-18 11:42:06)

***Titan's Valiant* Conference Room**
Brought on board the Republic Hammerhead-class cruiser, Titan's Valiant, you were ushered into the meeting room upon arrival. They seem to want to waste no time in getting you where you belong.
Already at the long, oval conference table with her feet up on an adjacent chair is the one who invited you to come. The stars in the viewport behind her shoot past in the throes of hyperspace. Introducing herself as Ka'ra, the woman armored in a suit of black light armor, had promised you an adventure with the opportunity to earn some credits and the potential to do some good for the Republic. In the end you were offered exactly what was needed to get your participation.
Absentmindedly she pets a strange looking creature in her lap. The creature, covered in brown and spotted black fur and hangs in loose folds, is about a meter long sporting six legs, an overcrowded mouth of sharp teeth and a long tail almost twice as long as its body. A foul smell seems to emanate from the creature as you move closer to it which the woman seems untroubled by.
Behind you the door closes, the guards on either side doing their best to pretend nothing important is going on. Due to her helmet its is unclear whether she has noticed your arrival or not. The creature opens one eye looking lazily toward the door, obviously noticing the comings, before closing it again.

As Yuri walks into the room, the first thing that strikes him is a foul smell, and after taking a quick look around, he notices the woman already at the table, and the strange creature in her lap. While moving to take a seat, he curiously eyes the creature, trying to determine what it is. He has traveled around quite a bit in the last time, but he can´t recall seeing a creature like that.
As he sits down, he pulls back the hood of his cloak, revealing his shaved head, and the brilliant blue eyes that contrasts his somewhat pale skin. While waiting for everyone else to take their seat, he thinks about why he have come.
The armored woman - Ka'ra, was it? - had offered him a chance to earn some credits, but more importantly, she had offered him a chance to do some good for the Republic. It had been a while since he had been in the employment of the Republic. In fact, he hadn´t been affiliated with them since the day he left the Jedi Temple, and took up the role as a bounty hunter. He had spent his time mainly in the Outer Rim territories, assisting law enforcement agencies in fighting crime, or searching for fugitive criminals and missing people. And all the while, he had kept his eyes and ears open for any sign of the Sith that remained at large in the Galaxy, as he eventually hoped to turn the tables on these dark hunters.

'Ka'ra' The name stung Kin more than any weapon could ever hope to. Even as he limped into the room the name seemed to fill his mind. The offer of work was welcome, the republic marines had kept him away from active duty and his work aboard the vessel was tiring, as well as boring. When he heard that name it almost seemed as though the force had something to do with it. Not that he believed in such trivial things. He stopped and closed his eyes for a moment. A Mandolorian was the first thing he saw, the distinctive armour would forever be etched upon his memory, he saw it whenever he closed his eyes.
He sighed and opened his deceptively cybernetic eyes, looking across at the others in the room. The armoured woman attracted his attention the most. He almost thought she was mandalorian for a moment before dismissing the thought. There was no way a mandalorian would have anything to do with a republic mission. Still, the armour was strange to him though he didn't comment on it. In fact he stayed silent and just stood next to the table rather than taking a seat.

A young man casually walked into the room and looked around, his eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses. His white suit and jewelry suggested that he had done well in life and was not afraid to show it off. The blaster pistol that was also at his side did not look like a normal pistol, the barrel was slightly longer and had three wires leading off it then connected to the main part of the gun. The handle had a custom grip and had the finger guard removed. As soon as the man noticed the smell he waved his hand in front of his face "Whoaa...who ever that is need to use the refresher." he said as he approached the table. He pulled the chair out and spun it right before sitting down and proceeded to prop his feet up on the table.
Without even asking he pulled out a flask and took a shot of some sort of clear liquid before pulling up his sleeve, reveling a finely decorated bracer computer. He started typing something and paused for a moment. After a sigh he began typing again then covered the bracer compute "Hey what do you have to do to get a flameout?" he asked to no one in particular as he took another shot of the liquid.
He looked around the room again and noticed the two other men and then looked at the armored woman. He lowered his sunglasses for a moment and then pulled his sleeve up, typing something on his computer. He looked back up "Wow" he started as he returned his sunglasses back to their original position "that's pretty impressive armor there. I'm willing to bet it might even slow down, if not stop, a lightsaber." He wanted to know where she got the metal from but he knew that most people aren't willing to share information like that. *So we've got baldy and the one armed bandit, can't wait to see who else I get to meet up with. This job had better be worth it cause I could be off exploring and doing research so I can make my own company* he thought sitting back in the chair.

Arriving in a bit of a disheveled mess, Dremmin walks in with a bit of a clamor as he drops his utility belt while trying to freshen up his look. **"Drem, you bantha-brained …"** he mutters, picking his stuff up while snapping it back to the belt. **"This is no way to …"** Looking up from his mess, he suddenly realizes he's not alone by the smell in the room. **"Whew, who's cooking the voorpack in sour blue milk?"** He announces, trying to look a bit professional.
Walking towards the table, he slides out a a chair and plops down in it, examining everyone briefly. *Geez, tough room*, he thought, clearing his throat. **"You know, voorpak isn't all that bad if cooked properly … a hint of lum snuck in as a marinade makes them taste pretty delicious. Though my personal favorite is spiced nerf with some tubers. Best meal in the galaxy."** *You're babbling, Drem,* he thought once again. With that, he huffed into his hand, taking a brief inventory of his breath to insure he wasn't what smelled. **"Anyone have a mint?"**

The door to the conference room opens and a young woman, some might even just think of her as a girl, enter the room, together with a silver protocol droid. Both carry a tray of various refreshments, from ordinary water to a few more exotic and perhaps delicious fruits. The young human woman has long black hair tied back in a pony tail, a pair of brown eyes and could be considered slightly more attractive than most other human female faces. She is dressed in a loose light grey outfit, a pair of black boots and with an utility belt.
She walks around the room with her tray, though a perceptive onlooker might notice that she keeps her distance from the foul-smelling creature, glancing in its direction from time to time. "Can I offer a refreshment, sir/ma'am," is heard from her as she offers to all the gathered individuals.

"Yeah babe, could you get me the biggest bottle of Flameout that you have, hold off on the ice and something sweet to eat would be nice." the young man said with out even looking up "As for mints...don't have any but if you're trying to get ride of a bad taste in your mouth try a shot of this." He held his arm out offering the new guy his flask. *and now we have the hobo to join us as well. I can see that most of my time is going to be spent working on my projects so these guys can do the fighting. Go figure that everyone else on this mission would be a weapon jockey.* he thought with a sigh.

Ka'ra sits up, lowering her legs from their perched position on the chair next to her. The creature yawns as a complaint and then jumps down from her lap, disappearing from view under the table. Standing her hands resting flat on the table as she nods to each person in turn. "**Yuri Carkov, Dremmin Kol, Kin Var, Alarick Physalis.**" You notice her speech has something of a lilt to it, and her accent betrays the fact Basic had not been the first language she had learned to speak. At last she nods to the woman bearing the tray. "**Fiolla. You have been gathered here for an important mission for the Republic. Captain Prius will conduct the briefing once she arrives, till then,**" Her head turns as she takes in Kin Var, still standing almost at attention near the table. "**Get comfortable**."

Taking Ka'ra´s statement as a sign that everyone who would attend the briefing had arrived, Yuri leaned back a bit in his chair, until he felt the small cylindrical holster at his lower back hit the seat. It added some measure of comfort to him to feel the weapon present. He hadn´t used it in a while now, not since he was hired to track that Trandoshan slaver back on Ord Mantell. He used it sparingly these days, not brandishing his Jedi legacy all to openly. His appearance and work in these times identified him as a bounty hunter, and he was perfectly happy to keep it that way.
Closing his eyes for a moment, he expanded his awareness across the room, and reached out in the Force. It was a habit he had acquired in his search for the Sith, to always keep track of any persons sensitive to the Force that he had around him.

Fiolla heard Ka'ra mention her name and stopped serving. Then as she heard the words about getting comfortable, the young woman moves to take a seat at the oval conference table near Ka'ra. She does take a deep breath before approaching too close though, the stench from the pet being just a bit too much for poor Fiolla. Then she sits quietly and awaits further instructions.
As she sits there, she quietly studies the others, what may be her future team, wondering what the rest are capable of. Even though she might notice a few weapons, she doesn't take any actions, trusting Ka'ra to hire only those loyal.

Upon hearing the woman speak Kin's heart began to race. He recognised the accent immediately, his mind flashing back to the encounter with the only mandalorian prisoner they ever took.
The 'warrior' was enraged, almost bestial like a wild animal locked in a cage, thirsty for the blood of innocent republic citizens. It chilled Kin Var to the bone, reminded him of why he was fighting the war. Two guards and durasteel bars didn't make Kin feel any safer around the animal. It spoke only in threats and madness, declaring that Serroco would be one of many worlds to be glassed beneath their weapons. Words of malice and hatred were the last that it spoke, the Commander ordered an execution and Kin was the one who provided it. There was never any regret, Not for Kin or the Mandalorian.
"Comfortable.." spat Kin Var with hatred as his mind found it's way back into the present. "What of The enslaved Cathar and others? Were they comfortable as they were worked to death?" Kin was only a few paces from the woman now, "Your kind aren't welcome in the Republic, Mandalorian!"

Alarick smiled as he took off his coat and pulled out a cigar. He pulled out a lighter and lit the cigar allowing the the end to become red. As he crossed his legs he folded his arms behind his head as he let smoke drift out from his teeth "Ok if I'm going to be here for a wile I'm going to need something to eat, something more than fruit. I'll take some Gi dumpling soup with bassel sea salt and a ryshcate. As for something to drink I'm still waiting on that flameout."
Upon hearing that the warrior was a mandalorian his eyes lit up. Mandalorians needed a lot of weapons and armor, plus he figured he could pick up a few tip on how to improve on his fathers tech. As he looked at the man standing up he could hear the anger in his voice "Wow wow wow there buddy, I'm sure the lady has her reasons for being here. On top of that I doubt the captain would have allowed her aboard with good reasons. Finely when it comes down to it I'm going to put my money on toots over there. I mean she does have the evil looking fur ball to help out." he added with a smile

Drem smirked at Alarick's offer and snagged the flask while listening to Ka'ra, taking a healthy swig in the process. Instantly, his face puckered a bit as he fought to contain the lava that was currently searing his mouth. *Sonovabospor!* He screamed in his head. *I need to pack some of that if I ever need antiseptic on the field or to kill some mynocks*. Still suffering from the burning, he offered the flask back to its owner as their host stated "Get comfortable".
Turning to look for the serving girl, he notices that she takes a seat and realizes that his hopes of water or some form of milk to calm the liquid fire. Having no other choice, Drem swallows his pride and begins fanning his mouth slightly, attempting not to be obvious, but, in the process, failing miserably. Looking to Alarick, he asks, "**What the nass did you put in there? Tastes almost like an Eyeblaster … or Thumper piss**." *Man, I hope it wasn't Thumper piss*, he thought to himself. He looked to their host once again and, right before he was about to speak, was quickly silenced by Kin's "Mandorian" accusation. *Dammit, Drem, what've you gotten yourself into this time?*
"**Excuse me?**" He pondered, standing up slowly and keeping his hands out and open. "**Why don't we just relax … and … uhh … have some chow? Or maybe some drinks?" Looking to their host, he smiled and said, "Do you have any juice? Maybe some water? Milk? Extinguisher?**"

As Kin's voice rises in anger against Ka'ra, the creature leaps up onto the table. Placing itself between Kin and its master in a low stance on its six legs. Baring its overcrowded set of sharp teeth it lets out a low threatening growl and its long tail flicks in agitation.
"**Tentia, Osi'kyr! Gev!**" Ka'ra commands never having left the position she had taken upon standing, apparently she had been completely unphased by Kin's verbal onslaught. The creature's ears fold back toward Ka'ra and its head turns slightly to look at her. "**Usen'ye**." She adds, bobbing her head to the side in a "get out of here" manner now that she had the creature's attention. Turning back fully to Kin it bares its teeth even more, before giving a yawn, exposing ever more teeth, in apparent boredom and jumping off the table.
Folding her hands behind her back in a military at ease stance, she seems to consider Kin for a second. "I apologize for Tentia. It's always been protective of me," she says in a calm, conversational tone. "**Captain Prius informed me of your history when I picked you for this mission. I had hoped that your sense of duty to the Republic would overcome any past feelings. If you feel you cannot work with me, there's the door. I'll inform the captain that you should be returned to your normal duties.**" With one hand she points to the door.
Then without another word, she resumes her seat, feeling that part of the discussion over.

Alarick started laughing as he watched the man force himself to down the shot. He picked up the flask and looked at it "Oh this... half a dose of Starshine Surprise, some of Aludium pu-36 and a little Algae sugar. I doubt you'll be able to taste anything for the next day. There's a reason I only take one shot of this every now and then." As he spoke a bit more smoke drifted from his mouth. He smiled again as he watched Ka'ra handle thing *Looks like toots put bandit boy in his place* "So how about some grub?"

Fiolla had been ready to step in, if it actually did come to a fight. As a stray thought she quickly revised the idea that this group were all loyal to the Mandalorian. Her hand subconsciously moved towards her belt, only for her to realize that she held no weapon. "I..." she starts saying in a voice that is drowned out when the creature goes into action, effectively causing Fiolla to shut up.
After matters have been defused, she finally notice the matters not related to the possible fight, such as the man who was desperately asking for some beverages, even fire extinguishers, in order to remove the bad taste of whatever he had been eating or drinking. She does cast a quick glance over at the drinking and smoking guy who asks about food, before looking back at the most urgent matter, Drem.
"I do have a few water rations in my belt," Fiolla says, retrieving the small bottles of water that fit together with the rations. "Start out with this, then I'll find some more beverages..." As she finishes this sentence, she looks at Alarick. "... and something edible."
With that said, she quickly calls over the silver protocol droid and gives it instructions to bring drinks and food (in that order).

"It isn't my past I'm concerned with, but yours. Don't think for one second I'll ever trust you or rely on you for anything." Kin turned away from the Mandaorian and walked around to the opposite side of the table where he stared at her for a moment. Intent to mointer her, clearly suspicious of her motives and heritage. "If you're so eager to help the republic, then perhaps you can tell us why we are here? No doubt to fix a problem caused by your people."

Realizing the obvious futility in trying to get some relaxation and meditation in all this turmoil, Yuri opened his eyes again. Looking over at the Nautolan, he could feel the rage and hatred radiating from him. Feelings he knew all too well, and feelings he worked very hard to make his own to control as he desired, instead of having them control him, like they just had done with the Nautolan.
"Relax friend, and don´t make a fool of yourself. Has this woman done anything to deserve your hatred? Her people might, but has *she*? Someone in the Republic obviously trusts her, or she wouldn´t be here, and she has already told us that the captain of this ship will be here soon to explain why we´re here"

### **Darren** (2010-05-19 07:05:05)

A young woman, or to be more accurate a young girl steps into the room, she can't be much older than thirteen or fourteen. A quick glance to measure her would put her height at roughly 4 feet 8 inches tall, with a slim build and looking like she couldn't weigh more than eighty pounds even counting the weight of her white flight-suit. Her vibrant sea-green eyes darting quickly among the many people assembled in it that she doesn't recognise and finally stopping on the one that she does, Ka'ra.
She seems to spend a moment paused as if uncertain whether to stay near the door or move closer to Ka'ra, before she starts walking hesitantly across the room toward her, her footsteps soft and light on the ground in front of her, and her deep red hair that goes down a little passed her shoulders wafting around softly as she does so.
As she moves across the room, her sea-green eyes return to roving among those assembled in the room, as if trying to get to know them by simply examining their exterior appearance thoroughly. She doesn't say anything as she moves through the room merely watching and examining at the moment.

### **Alicia** (2010-05-19 09:43:59)

Ka'ra makes no indications to the girl other than to pull the chair she had been using as a foot stool out. "**Su'cuy, adi'ka.**" she says in a kind and quiet tone only once the girl has taken the seat. The others around the table can hear the conversation she's having with the girl, apparently Ka'ra is unconcerned about the displays of affection she shows her. "**Did you have an interesting day? Stay out of trouble?**" From beneath the table the strill makes an appearance, rubbing its head against Emily's knee. Ka'ra's attention focuses on Emily as she waits for her account.

Taking the water ration, he nods a smiling thanks to Fiolla as he downs it in an attempt to quench the burning sensation. *Wait, did he just say 'Aludium pu-36'?* He pondered, growing a bit long in the face as the burning sensation increased a bit. Fighting with the water in his mouth, he forced it down his throat, a wince of distaste and pain quickly coming over his face. *Oh that was a mistake, you bantha-brained fool!* He thought of himself. *Any first year knows you don't mix aludium pu-36 with water unless you want a hotter drink.* Drem fought the watering in his eyes as he struggled to pay attention to what Ka'ra had said.
Waving to Fiolla, he rasped out quietly, "**Milk … going to need some milk … and maybe some flatcake …**" Looking to Alarick, he attempted to put up a manly facade and gave him a thumbs up, forcing a smile through the heated pain in his mouth. *Maybe I should've had the Thumper piss after all*, he contemplated to himself as the others talked.
Hearing the door open, Drem quickly looks over to it with hopes of milk and something to sop up the liquor in his system, but lets out a sigh when he sees only the young girl enter. *Note to self*, he thought, *start carrying more guroot around and pack a few water rations.*

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Darren** (2010-05-19 10:05:33)

Emily gives the strill a scratch behind it's ears as she looks at Ka'ra and replies, also loudly enough that everyone can hear, with a shrug and **"I managed to find a few things to do, but there isn't a lot to do on a ship like this."** and gives a smile as she continues, **"At least that wouldn't get me into trouble anyway."**
And then looks over at everyone else in the room again with her sea-green eyes, and then returns her gaze to Ka'ra as she asks, **"So what's with all the people? Am I interrupting something?"**

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Alicia** (2010-05-19 10:20:04)

Ka'ra gives a pleased nod, her expression hidden by the helmet. "**Jate, I'm glad. And no you're not interrupting.**" Ka'ra turns her head to take in the others in the room, before looking Emily back full in the face, meeting her gaze as much as she could with the T-visor blocking her eyes. "**We'll be briefed for an important mission; a dangerous mission.**" Pausing for a moment she let's that fact sink in. "**I believe you're ready, but if you don't want to go, adi'ka, I'll understand. Understand, though, you won't be along for the ride. You'll have to do your part. Tayli'bac?**"
With the girls affirmation she bobs her head at the others. "**Now, use the manners I taught you and introduce yourself.**"

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Darren** (2010-05-19 10:27:01)

Emily seems to be quite pleased about the idea of getting off the ship and heading somewhere where she can have some fun even if it will be dangerous. After affirming that she would be happy to go along with Ka'ra on the mission and receiving the request to introduce herself she looks back over the others and gives a short wave in greetings while saying **"Hi everyone, I'm Emily."**, her eyes darting among each of them as she talks as if judging their reactions to her introduction.

---

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Alicia** (2010-05-19 19:57:30)

Ka'ra apparently amused by the rough introduction gives a short mirthful laugh, giving the girl a light tap on the back. "**Ge'serim. Mhi ven borari muun bralir. Tayli'bac?**" With another small laugh Ka'ra picks up a glass of one of the fruit juices, putting it down in front of Emily.
At last the captain of the vessel appears. Her crisp naval uniform and her brown hair pulled up in a no nonsense manner, is mirrored by how she commands her ship. Casting a look around she seems to count to make sure everyone is present, she begins heading towards one of the free chairs at the table. "**For those who are unawares, I am Niandra Prius, Captain of this cruiser. I apologize for my tardiness, but I had to ensure our presence was unnoticed. I hope all of you have already made your introductions.**" Captain Prius looks around the table, seeming to gauge the attentiveness of those gathered.
Sure she has everyone's attention she continues, "**You are here because Ka'ra and I were contracted, so to speak, to form a team of operatives who would be best suited for the missions to come. You are to work under extreme caution and secrecy here on out. The Valiant will be standing ready to provide what assistance we can as a base of operations. Ka'ra will act as your mission liaison.**" Pausing she looks at Kin, indicating his anticipated outburst on the matter could wait.
Captain Prius seems to gather her thoughts for a moment before continuing. "**Through an informant we have learned a Force sensitive sect run by a Zabrak called Jut-hakk has been seeking and constructing a super weapon. While our informant has assured me he not close to completing it, I am concerned with what he could potentially accomplish with what he has. Your mission will be to infiltrate Jut-hakk's current base of operations where he is holding and studying a key component to the weapon and retrieve it.**"
She turns her attention to look at each and every one of the gathered team. "**The informant will be key to locating the item so it will be important to meet with him. Ka'ra will be joining you as she knows the identity of the informant and has gained clearance to the facility itself.**"
"**Any questions?**"

Fiolla quickly studied the newcoming girl, this Emily. She was however focused more on Drem, worried about his health, because he definitely didn't look well. A pair of fingers moved to his eye, to get a closer look at it, before she gave him a faint smile.
"Don't worry, milk will be here soon. Please relax yourself until the droid arrive, straining yourself in your condition might do some serious injuries to your internal system."
After feeling that she had done what she could for Drem, without resorting to more serious matters, she cast another quick look around, as if she was looking for something or someone, before her search was interrupted by the arrival of the Captain. She then listens to the briefing, before she asks her own question.
"Captain Prius, can you tell us more about this sect and this super weapon? What about this Zabrak leader? Or is the informant the only one with more information?"

Emily takes a few sips of her glass of juice as she listens to Prius giving the briefing of what this mission that they are going to be on is all about with interest. Once Prius has finished, she listens attentively to the questions being asked by Fiolla, and focuses her attention on Prius again curious what the answers will be to those questions, and decides to add one of her own, "Just how large is the facility, we are infiltrating?".

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Alicia** (2010-05-20 09:51:13)

Captain Prius listens to the questions, before indicating to Ka'ra for her to proceed. For a moment Ka'ra is silent, obviously debating what she deems important or at least trying to decide what she can't say. The hesitation is brief as she leans forward, folding her hands gauntleted on the table in front of her.
"**Jut-hakk's following comprises of Jedi and untrained Force users. Making it an order of Force Sensitives who live and learn with each other. He himself only took three students, dedicating his work to completing his ultimate goal. His students became his lieutenants, his trusted acolytes. Near the end of the Civil War, he's been recruiting soldiers to fill the ranks.**"
With a pause she takes a breath, gathering her thoughts again.
**"The facility is an abandoned R&D station, hidden within the depths of an asteroid field. It's remoteness has prevented anyone without knowledge of its location from finding it." From her pocket she retrieves a small data chip and inserts it into a slot near her at the table. At the center, the holo projector spills to life. At first it shows an asteroid field before zooming in towards a particular one. The display changes a final time to give a basic layout of the base. "There are three habitable levels. One floor has been dedicated to Jut-hakk, his most trusted followers and their students as use of a training grounds and facilities. Some of the more important officers have also been given quarters on this level. The second consists of the labs left over from the days of research and development as well as some administrative offices. The final level houses the techs, soldiers, researches, anyone who would not have been housed on the first level.**"
Ka'ra leaves the display up of the basic floor plans as she continues. "**Our entry point will be through the hanger bay. We have commandeered one of the transports used to carry cargo. This particular one was en route to the station. The cargo transport as well as my clearance will provide us access to the station, after we meet up with our contact and retrieve the weapon we will make our way back to the transport. It's to be a get in, get out maneuver.**"

Nodding a quick hello to Emily, Drem's eyes grew quite large in response to Fiolla's 'serious injuries' comments. *Oh for the luvamerch*, he thought, feeling his tongue go a bit numb. *Oh this is not good … not good at all*. Taking out a small stick of nerf jerky, he started prodding his tongue with it while also trying to remain discreet. *Okay, I can feel the stick, that's good. Maybe it's just an after-effect of the liquor.*
Listening to the parlay between Captain Prius, Fiolla and Ka'ra, he scratches the scruff of his chin, looking over the plans on the display. Thinking for a few moments, and pushing past the rawness of his mouth, Drem raises his hand and says roughly, "**Um .. hi … I have a couple of questions. Um, what if the contact isn't there to meet us? Do we have a back-up plan? And, no disrespect meant, isn't it kind of bold just popping through the front door? Call me a pessimist, but my experiences have always taught me to be a bit careful. If it's too good to be true, it probably is. Ma'am .. sir .. er … Captain?**" With that said, he lowered his hand and split his attention to any conversation and the plan specs.

After having received a reply for one of her questions and hearing others place their own, Fiolla remains quiet, wishing to hear those answers. After that she crosses her arms over her chest, and spends her time looking over her future companions in this assignment, in particular studying the Nautolan just a bit longer than the rest.
Her hand moves down to her belt, reaching for something that isn't there, and for those who notice her mannerisms, it is obvious that she does seem a bit uneasy. However through sheer willpower her face doesn't give off any signs, it is the rest of the body that seems just that bit more tense.

"That sounds like damn suicide. A good job you sent for me then eh? Wouldn't want someone with friends or family to die on this little mission of yours.." Kin's eyes squinted slightly as he studied the map of the building, he hadn't been in this kind of assault for a long time, the journey was always the worst part. You could only sit there perfectly still as your life hung in the balance, completely relying on the pilot to jink and bank to avoid any incoming fire. Hoping the enemy gunner got something in his eye at just the right moment, Kin doubted he could survive being blown from a transport. He entertained the thought for a few moments though, would be a flashy way to die.
"If she's the liason, then who's giving the orders on the ground?" He asked, Kin had never been a leader. He didn't care much who lead, as long as it wasn't the kid."

Ka'ra's fingers twitch slightly from their clasped position in front of her. "**Plans have been carefully lain. If things have… how is it put… gone to hell already, we would know. Better for now to assume we can enter smoothly. It's getting out I'm more concerned about. Once they realize our contact and myself have defected, we may have the whole station coming after us. Not to mention Jut-hakk will pull out all the stops to retrieve the weapon if we are caught.**"
Captain Prius leans forward slightly in preparation to add her thoughts. "A**rrangements have already been made to provide two transmitters which can be used to contact us. We will be less than a minute away via hyperspace.**" Her attention turns to Kin. "**For now, Ka'ra will act as the field commander. Right now knowledge is crucial and she has it.**" The two women exchanged a nod of agreement. Standing Prius takes one last look at everyone gathered. "**If there are no further questions this briefing is adjourned.**"

The captain had caught Yuri´s ears with the mentioning of the word "Jedi", and he listened interestingly as the mission and the plan was described. He smiled a bit and mused inside as some of those present expressed their feelings about the mission. Just like Ka'ra said, he felt this was the kind of mission that unless you know something had already screwed up, you should just assume that it would work, because everything that would go wrong would do so after you were done planning anyway. The Force certainly worked in mysterious ways sometimes.
He did have another question though, and as the captain got up he raised it.
"Not so much a question perhaps, but I´d like to know more about this Jut-Hakk and his followers. You say they consist of Jedi and untrained Force users. Were some of his Jedi followers under Malak´s service in the Civil War, or did they all decide to take up new careers during the recent year? And Jut-Hakk himself, what do we know of him? I´m curious, since I´d hate to run into Malak´s secret apprentice...that´d complicate things a bit, I´d say"

Emily listens to the answers being provided to the questions being asked by everyone else. Her eyes flicking from person to person as the ask their questions of the Captain, and Ka'ra. Once she has finished her eyes flick over to the only one that hasn't spoken yet, looking at him with curious eyes as she considers why he hasn't asked any questions of his own yet.
After a few moments of looking at him, she asks, **"What about you? Don't you have any questions?"**

Alarick was busy typing something up on his computer and did not seem too interested in the mission. *Great now we have short stuff to babysit and from the way things are going this sound like a smash and grab job. So do they think that I'll just be the pilot? If so then why did they even bother to bring me in?* Thoughts like this bounced around in his head as he put the cigar out and went back to typing on his computer. *Now download the blue prints lets see here if I thin down the chamber wall here…no that would raise the chance of an overload to unsafe levels.*
As the briefing continued Alarick looked at the others as someone address him "Hum... questions?...Yeah I have lots of them, none of which anyone in this room can answer" he said looking back at his computer "as for questions that have anything what so ever this mission. I only have one when do my skills come into play, if they do at all?" he asked taking a sip of water.

Prius, now standing, looks everyone in attendance over. "**Ka'ra will be able to answer your questions from here.**" Her attention focuses on the Mandalorian woman. "**I would speak to you before you depart.**" To this Ka'ra supplies her with a nod. "**Happy hunting. May the Force be with you.**"
"**Oya!**" Ka'ra says enthusiastically in apparent agreement. With a small smile, Captain Prius heads for the door.
Turning her attention to Alarick, she makes the same offer she had made Kin, "**If you feel we are wasting your time, Mister Physalis, then you are welcome to remain behind and leave at the conclusion of our mission. If however, you agree that a person with your skills in mechanics and computers is a welcome addition to any team going into a situation where stealth is key, then you're more than welcome to stay.**"
Her head turns to look at Yuri. "**I can try to answer your questions on the way there. Though I must tell you there are some things I won't be able to answer. Unless there are any other mission related quesitons, I suggest you make any final preparations and meet me in the hanger bay.**" Obviously a dismissal, she pulls out the chip to the holoprojector. It sputters static for a moment and then turns off.

Drem's mind stuck on a phrase ... "if we are caught". *What's that mean*, he thought, distracted finally from the burning sensation in his mouth. *How much of a possibility is it that we'll get caught*? Thinking on it a bit more, he raised his hand once again, this time with a bit more focus. "**Excuse me, not meaning to interrupt or anything, but maybe we should get a handle on our capabilities first? Perhaps knowing what each of us brings to this mission might help us be a bit more confident in our skills … not to mention it could help us refer to one another beyond 'Hey You' or by species. Unless we're supposed to have code-names?**" Considering that quickly, Drem quickly blurted out, "If we do, can we pick our own?" It was obvious that he had a few ideas on what he might call himself ...

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-05-22 16:39:01)

Yuri gave a slight nod to Ka'ra as she said she´d try to answer his questions later.
"Fair enough. I just beleive in being prepared. Also, if we´re going up against a Sith Lord, I think I´ll need to renegotiate my fee"
Accompanying the last sentence with a smile, he got ready to stand up and head for the hangar bay. He didn´t really have any preparations to do before the mission, though he thought he might to try and get a moment of peace and meditation. He had a feeling this mission would be something different then what he had been doing the last time, and he sincerely hoped that none of Jut-Hakk´s followers would turn out to be people he had known.

Alarick did not respond to the offer to walk out on the mission. He knew that his skill were needed, after all most the people here would use a wrench as a weapon before they used for a tool. As for computers...well he was just going to leave that one alone. It made his mind hurt just think what these people would do to a computer. As the capitan walked out he realized that he was not getting his food. With a sigh he lowered his feet and stood up. He grabbed his jacket and threw it over his shoulder without looking at the others "Well you can do what you want spunky but if you call me anything besides Alarick or Mr. Physalis I will ignore you." With that he makes his way to the hanger.

Emily listens to the questions everyone else asked and their answers, and notices the rapid emptying of the room once Captain Prius leaves. Emily then puts down her half-empty glass of juice down and stands up, and walks over the short distance between her and Drem, and says to him, with a smile, **"Well I've already given you my name, so why don't you start? Who are you and what skills do you have?"**

Drem watched as some of the others were packing up their things and getting ready to leave. Sighing to himself, he reached to his stuff as Emily approached him and spoke to him. "**Hm?**" he said, a bit surprised. "**Oh, uh, hi. Well, I guess that'd be a good idea. I'm Dremmin Kol and I guess most would categorize me as an explorer or scholar. I've always liked a good challenge, and, well, according to everyone, I guess this is as adventurous as one can get. As for what I can bring to the table, well, I know a bit about survival and fancy myself as a jack of all trades. In the past, some have called me a bit reckless, but I've managed to survive this long … sorry, am I rambling?**" Drem scratched the back of his neck, a bit nervous and looked around at everyone else. "**Most people call me Drem, so I guess that's what you can call me,**" he stated to the girl, while also referring to the group. "**What about the rest of you?**"

"Sergeant Kin Var of the Galactic Marine Corps. You can probably tell that I'm not easy to kill. Mandalorians destroyed my ship around me but still couldn't end my life. They never could." Kin crossed his arms and looked at the others who hadn't left yet. "I'm tough enough to take punishment that would probably kill you and I can survive out in the wild. "I guess I'm here to provide some muscle.. I can do one more thing. Tell you to never trust that Mandalorian, and I mean it. The moment you do she'll leave you for dead with a scorched hole in your skull."

As others introduce themselves, the young woman also makes her own presentation. As she does this she gives all a smile and a nod. "I am Fiolla. As for what I bring to the table, then I can take care of wounds, though I am not qualified as a doctor. However for this assignment the belief is probably that I can handle the job, otherwise I would not have been chosen.

Ka'ra still in the room, turns her attention to Kin, and beneath the table a low growl could be heard. With one hand she reaches up and removes her helmet with a sharp hiss of released air. The woman beneath the helmet is young, probably no more than seventeen standard years. With her free hand she moves a strand of her stray shoulder length red hair behind one ear in a habitual gesture. All the while she never takes her sharp, penetrating blue eyes from Kin. There's a hint of sadness in them, as if she feels sorry for Kin.
Reaching out she grabs the glass of juice Emily abandoned and finishes it off. Standing, she begins moving toward the hallway without saying another word. As she nears the door, she replaces her helmet another hiss indicating the presence of vacuum seals. Behind her trots her strill companion, whose gaze never leaves Kin as they depart.

Halfway up from his chair, Yuri decides that he can spend a little while longer with the rest of the group, and seeing as they will be working together, introductions does sound like a good idea. As the sunglass-wearing man who obviously think very much of himself leaves the room with a cocky comment, the bounty hunter cannot help but let a smile onto his face.
"That does it, he´s getting a codename"
Relaxing back into his chair, he listens as the others introduces themselves. It seems like the crew is well-rounded and capable, though he has to admit to being a bit skeptical to how the Nautolan will fare if they are forced to confront Force-wielding foes. After all, not all dangers can be met with muscle. But he decides that they´ll just have to handle that when it happens.
As Ka'ra leaves the room, he clears his throat a bit.
"Well, I guess that leaves me then. Yuri Carkov is the name, and bounty hunter is the trade. I am skilled in a bit of this and that, but I guess my main skill is getting into places I´m not supposed to be in. And of course, if I get caught, to convince people that I really have business being there"

Emily looks at each of the people as they introduce themselves, listening to their names and whatever they were willing to share about their skill-sets. Her eyes do stray during this to watch Ka'ra and her Strill companion leave, but she doesn't follow along, instead listening to Yuri's statement about giving Alarick a codename with a smile, and the rest of his introduction. Once he finishes speaking she says, in a quiet voice with her eyes looking at Fiolla, **"It sounds like you all have very interesting and diverse skill-sets."**

Wondering if even a lightsaber could cut the tension between Kin and Ka'ra, Drem listens to everyone, taking in who they are and how well they could work together. Looking at Kin, he says, "**Geez, Sarge, you might want to take the force pike out. I don't think there's a single person aboard this ship who can't tell your feelings towards Mandalorians, but maybe you should tone it down a bit? You're really coming off as a murglak, bub and we have a job to do.**"
Hearing Yuri mention 'codename' makes Drem chuckle a bit. Looking to Yuri, he says, "**Sorry … all this 'covert ops' stuff is still kind of sinking in. I was just considering what our shaded friend might actually have as a codename and it brought a chuckle to me.**" Looking to everyone else, Drem did a quick check to see if he'd forgotten anything and stated, "**Well, I guess we head out then? We have a galaxy to save …**" While he sounded confident in his statement, Drem couldn't help but wonder what he'd done to get mixed into such a reckless plot. But, as he reached the door, it occurred to him that he was Dremmin Kol, and hair-brained schemes were his specialty.

Emily watches Drem leave the room heading for the hanger, before she slips out of the room herself, moving with the same quiet light footsteps that she entered the room with her hair moving freely as she walks. Having yet to pack not having expected to be going on a mission she heads to the her room first in order to hurriedly pack some of her clothes, and other equipment that might be useful to the mission before making her way quickly down to the hanger so they don't just leave her behind.

Fiolla looks at Emily as she answers, "Yes, it looks like we got diverse skills, now we just need to be able to cooperate," then gives a nod and a faint smile in the direction of Drem, before letting out a laugh. "And sure, why not? I don't have other plans, so saving the Galaxy sounds like a great distraction from boredom..."
After completing that sentence, Fiolla quickly followed Ka'ra, tilting her head slightly to the left as she asked the Mandalorian a few more quests on the way to their transportation. "I assume that we'll be getting weapons and other necessities once aboard the starship? And is is possible for us to possibly get additional mission dependent gear, if we don't already have it available?"

Ka'ra has set a quick pace upon leaving the room and Fiolla is hard pressed at first to locate her. Once she's caught up Ka'ra slows down allowing Fiolla to ask her questions. "**We will have to see what the quartermaster has in stock. Give me your list and I'll make a stop on my way to the shuttle.**" Stopping outside a lift, she stands to one side as a pair of crew members walk out of it giving Ka'ra wary looks as they pass. "**I'm on my way to meet Captain Prius. Why don't you meet me on the transport. Help the others get settled in.**" With that she steps into the lift after taking Fiolla's order of supplies.
Provided no one gets lost on the way, and even if you did there are plenty of crew members on the way to point the direction to the hanger bay. Several techs are working around the hanger's newest addition. The Herald-class shuttle sits near the edge of the bay, being prepped by the techs. They look up and nod as you pass heading toward the boarding ramp. It's evident when board that this shuttle was used mainly for the transportation of cargo. Passing an airtight bulkhead you can see what little living space. There are double bunks of fold down cots set into the wall, enough for a crew of six. The head is set into a room on the wall next to what passes as the mess. Beyond that is the cockpit which seats for the six crew members to strap in. The techs begin to vacate the area inside the shuttle as the group start to arrive.

Alarick made his way through the ship, only getting lost once. He had almost made his way to the engine room before he realized that he was going in the wrong direction. After asking a crew member for direction, and getting slapped for asking where her room was, he made his way to the hanger. As he walked in he looked around still rubbing his cheek "It was only a simple question. I don't see why she had to go over board like that." he stopped and looked around the hanger for a second and whistled "I forgot how big these ships can be. I would just hack into the main computer and download the ship schematics but I have a feeling that would get me shot." he muttered to himself.
Upon seeing the shuttle he made his way around the ship, looking for anything out of place. Not finding anything he walked into the ship and spotted the techs "What are you working on there....right...you're kidding me right, here get out of the way and let me work." he said sounding annoyed *Well I can tell the tone of this mission has already been set. Perhaps I should lock the computer down from everyone but me and the pilot. I think I'll do that as soon as I'm done here.* He took his jacket off and threw it over the copilot set before sitting down and getting to work.

Emily makes her way with her packed bag down to the hanger bay, and looks over the exterior of the shuttle that they will be taking to the station, resting her bag on the floor for a moment. She notices a couple of the technicians looking at her as she tarries in the hanger bay and gives them a smile and a wave as she lifts her packed bag from the floor and heads into the shuttle.
She stows her bag once she gets into the shuttle, and then heads for the cockpit, seeing Alarick sitting in the co-pilot seat she smiles mischievously and slips into the pilot seat saying, **"Beautiful isn't she?"** as she watches him playing around with the co-pilots console.

As Yuri leaves the briefing room, he makes his way towards the hangar. He doesn´t really have any possessions to gather, he owns pretty much only what he carries with him. When he enters the hangar, he looks around until he finds the shuttle they are supposed to leave in. He´s never been particularly interested in ships and models and such things, but he would bet a few credits it was the one with all the techs swarming about.
As he enters the shuttle, he finds the living quarters, and decides that he is going to take one of the top bunks. Then he notices the cockpit door and the people inside, and decides to poke his head in.
"So, are either one of you going to be flying this thing?"

After stopping by the refresher and also snagging a bottle of milk from the cafeteria, Drem finally wanders into the hangar bay looking a bit more ... well, refreshed. Looking at the shuttle, he grins a bit and lets out a low whistle, thinking, *A little modification and this could be a ship to be reckoned with*. Nodding to the techs, he walks up the ramp and takes a healthy look around before saying, in an Alderaanian accent, "**Lyra, I'm home.**" (an obvious poke at the famous holovid "*In Love With Lyra*"). Peeking his head into the cockpit, he sees the others and asks, "**Everyone here yet?**"
Hearing Yuri ask about piloting, Drem, inquires, "**Does anyone else actually know how to fly a ship?**"

Kin left the room silently and headed to his own quarters, and then the armoury to pick up his equipment. He considered wearing his standard issue Republic armour but it was too inconspicuous for such a mission. Instead Kin just wore a faded black tanktop which left his cybernetic arm completelt visible. He liked it that way, it intimidated quite a few people. The Flechette Launcher was like an old friend to Kin, it served him well in the vicious fighting within tight ship corridors and the like. It was a simple weapon, lacking in range but it made up for it with the ability to shred a man into red mist if they got close enough. The weapon was attached to a strap allowing Kin to carry it without having it in his hands all of the time, and it's ammunition clusters were stored in a bandolier that hung loosely to Kin's Torso.
Once he reached the transport, easily finding his way through the ship that was essentially his home, Kin quickly boarded before finding a place to claim as his own, preferably a quiet one. Upon finding the only living quarters as being a shared room, he grunts and sits down on a bunk, holding the flechette launcher close to his chest.

The techs, apparently deciding they had finished their job, relinquished controls to Alarick, clearing the panels of the work the were doing as they were shoved out of the way. As the last techs on board, the begin gathering their gear, hacking equipment mostly and to make their way off the shuttle giving out nods of greeting to those they pass on the way out.
Since Alarick had caught only a glimpse of the hyperspace logs techs had been working on, there's no real way he could continue the work if it even needed to be finished. The techs seemed to have been quite thorough in not leaving a trace of what they were doing.

Ka'ra entered the bay and headed straight toward the shuttle parked at the edge. Having retrieved her weapons, the previously missing heavy blaster pistol was now back in it's place in her hip holster. Slung across her back was the heavy blaster rifle, hanging in easy reach. A bandolier is slung casually over her shoulder its slots filled with grenades and power packs. Carrying no other baggage, other than a medical kit, it seems what she had on her were deemed the only possessions she would need on this venture. Behind her, getting disgusted looks as it passed, was her Strill companion keeping up easily on its six legs.
Stopping outside the shuttle, Ka'ra faces Fiolla and offers her the medical kit. "**Here's the supplies you requested. It was all I was able to get out of the quartermaster, but it should do for now.**" Fiolla would be pleased that not only were there four medpacs in the pouches, but the saber was hidden inconspicuously in there. Having full filled her purpose, Ka'ra and Tentia move past Fiolla onto the shuttle, making their way toward the cockpit.
They stop in the living quarters, and as Ka'ra takes her helmet off she looks at Kin with a slight frown. She places her rifle and her helmet into a locker near a bunk Tentia was clearly claiming as its own, having jumped up on to it and curled up. With everything stored she heads into the cockpit.
"**Ah, good everyone's here. We should be dropping out of hyperspace soon and that will be our cue to leave.**" Moving past the others she heads toward the front, and taps Alarick on the shoulder. "**If you would please, I'll be copiloting. Emily you're piloting.**" Ka'ra turns her head to look at the girl and gives her a reassuring smile.

Check. Crazy? Check. Good ole Uncle Gym would be proud*. A smirk crossed his face as he checked over his gear and weapons one last time. *You wanted adventure, Dremmin … well, you got it!* Looking around, he grinned and asked, "**So, anyone know any good traveling songs?

Yuri moves out of the way a bit to let others in the cockpit, and settles down in one of the empty seats in the cockpit. He does not have skills in either piloting or handling the other various systems on a ship, so he figures he´ll just stand back and let the others take care of that. When Dremmin suggests that they sing a song, and without waiting for a response starts to whistle, Yuri shakes his head and gives up a friendly smile.
**"I think you´ve got the concept of a stealth mission wrong pal. Though I suppose it would be good for you to get it out now, before we reach our destination"**

Emily looks at Ka'ra her surprise at being asked to pilot evident, but it rapidly fades away into excitement as her hands start to move over the controls with an almost surprising familiarity in spite of her age it is clear this isn't the first time she has piloted a shuttle.
As Alarick gives his statement about his clear disdain for putting his life in her hands it's clear that she is far from happy about it but she doesn't say anything, instead just concentrates on running the ship through it's preflight checks to prepare for when the ship drops out of hyperspace.
After Yuri has told Drem that he has the wrong idea by singing Emily says, **"I think singing would be a lovely idea myself."** with a hard look at Yuri, **"I'm afraid I don't know many songs though."**

After receiving her lightsaber and the medical kit, Fiolla swiftly attaches her lightsaber to the concealed holster in her right sleeve, ready for quick retrieval. Then she follows Ka'ra into the cockpit, casting a quick glance over the rest of her team, noticing who is sitting where, in particular taking note that the 'kid' is the one who should pilot.
"I'm just going to sit here," the young female Jedi says, as she slides into one of the 'normal' seats that has no particular configuration. Then she examine the Medical kit, making sure that it holds the necessary supplies.

Drem smirks up to Yuri, **"I'm not suggesting that we sing during the mission, just during the flight to pass some time."** Pausing for a moment, he watches Alarick storm out and hears Emily agree with him and says, once again to Yuri with a smirk, **"See?"** Looking back to the cockpit entry, he thought, *Drinking game? With him? Last time I drank something he had, I thought I was going to burn from the inside. Besides, it's better that I stay here just in case I can be some help.*
Taking a quick inventory of the cockpit, he piped up once again. **"Okay … so, I'm not sure of any songs either,"** he pondered to everyone. **"I know some great stories though if someone's interested? It's too bad I lost my pazzik deck in a game of sabacc, otherwise we could play some cards …"**

At getting looks from both Emily and Dremmin, Yuri can´t hold back a small laugh.
**"I´m just saying it might be a good idea to get into the right mindset as soon as possible. Usually works for me. But if you feel like singing, by all means do. Though unfortunately I can´t be of much assistance there"**
Leaning back a bit in his chair, he closed his eyes for a moment, and let his thoughts drift away.

Ka'ra assists Emily in doing the pre-flight checks. Clicking the comm on she contacted the ships'd hanger control. "**Shuttle E3452, green for launch.**"
***"Acknowledged, shuttle. Departure in two minutes."***
Ka'ra done with her task, looks back at the others. "**I know a couple songs, unfortunately they don't translate well.**" With a shrug she leans back in her seat and takes the opportunity to strap in.
***"Shuttle E3452, you are cleared to launch."*** the voice says, returning over the comm channel.
Pressing another button on the comm panel she turned on the speakers toward the back of the ship. "**We are taking off and will be entering lightspeed shortly. Brace yourselves.**" With a nod to Emily, Ka'ra relaxes in her seat her hands resting in her lap. This was obviously going to be the girl's show.

Once they have clearance for take off, Emily turns her attention back to the controls and activates the shuttles drive systems she moves the shuttle smoothly out of the hanger and out into space, and begins putting a bit of distance between the shuttle and the Cruiser for safety before she prepares the ship to enter lightspeed.
Once the shuttle is far enough away she turns back to the rest of the people and says, **"We are about to enter lightspeed, is everyone strapped in?"** Once she gets assents from those people sitting in the cockpit she will activate lightspeed, and will listen carefully for the expected thump from the only person not in the cockpit.

Drem gives Emily the thumbs up and starts to mutter something as the levers are pulled and the feeling of hyperspace grips the ship, lifting the gold medallion to his lips and kissing it. Smirking to himself, Drem begins singing to himself, but gladly welcomes anyone else that wants to join in ...

Fiolla takes a deep breath as the shuttle lifts off and then starts to enter herself into a meditative state. If they are to go on such a dangerous mission she needs to find her balance and prepare herself for what the future brings. She hardly even feels the sensations of entering hyperspeed. But her meditations are interrupted when she hears song.
It is with a slight annoyance (even if she tells herself not to be affected, a Jedi must remain calm) that she opens her eyes and stares at the singer, a frown on her lips. "I think you've chosen the right profession, because you shouldn't try out to be a holo singer. Some of us are trying to rest or relax, so could you turn down the noise? Please?"

Using the coordinates already set into the navicomputer, Emily successfully makes the jump into lightspeed. As the stars elongate, a thud could be heard in the cockpit from further back in the shuttle, as if something soft hit the bulkheads.
"**Ori'jate, adika,**" Ka'ra says approvingly apparently unconcerned by what the sound could mean. Unstrapping herself from the copilot seat, she stands and stretches. "**We have a couple hours before we reach the station. If you have any further questions… Well now would be the time to ask them.**" She eyes Yuri, her blue gaze piercing and knowing. Striding past the chairs she makes her way into the living area and then seems to collapse into the bunk Tentia had claimed. She spends a few moments scratching the Strill under the chin and stares at Kin who had passed out on his own bunk.

Drem listened to Ka'ra as she walked out of the cockpit. Snagging a dried bantha stick from his belt, he unwrapped it and took a bit with a loud "SNAP!" "**Ohh … I never thought I'd be so glad to see a bantha stick,**" Drem said to the others as he unfastened his harness. Looking around to everyone else as he continued feasting on the meat snack. "So," he started, looking to the door and back, "**Is anyone else worried that we might have a better chance taking on a Kryat Dragon with sticks and stones? Nothing against Ka'ra, but shouldn't we have a more solid plan?**" Looking to the door again, he walked over to it and pursued Ka'ra before anyone could answer him.
"**Excuse me,**" he stated, walking after her. "**Ka'ra, do we have something a bit more solid for the operations? Like what exactly our roles will be in this? I'm all for a good adventure, and I'm hardly one to back down in front of danger, but I'm also not the person teasing the rancor with a dangling Jawa. So, how about being less mysterious and more forthcoming?**"

Yuri gives Ka'ra a small nod of acknowledgment, and unstraps himself to follow her out in the main area of the ship. He halts himself in his step though, as Drem walks through it following Ka'ra out of the cockpit. Getting out into the main area, he settles down on a bunk, and listens to what Drem has to say before voicing his own questions.
**"I was just wondering about this Jut-Hakk fellow and his followers. You said a lot of them were Jedi, but that term is pretty broad in the wake of the Civil War, and is used interchangeably between the true Jedi, those who fell to Revan and Malak, and those fully indoctrinated in the Sith teachings. So I guess my question is if he has a following of surviving Padawans or fully trained Sith lords, as well as to where his own origins lie"**

Emily looks over her shoulder while still seated at the controls at all the people heading out of the cockpit to try and ask Ka'ra more questions, and shakes her head a little before turning her attention back to the controls. Even though they are in hyperspace for a couple of hours and it would be safe to head back for a bit of rest she decides not to and instead begins to play with the console, to see what information the shuttle has on board it about it's own name, who owns it, the name of the pilot, the crew and passenger manifests. And if the answers aren't to her liking she intends to do some modification of them.

### **Alicia** (2010-06-01 13:24:39)

Ka'ra glances between Yuri and Drem, amused and apparently pleased by the sudden backbone Drem was displaying. "**You're right, I have been rather… mysterious**," she pauses a moment, amused by the word. Growing serious again, she continues, "**The plan is this: This particular shuttle, belonging to our contact, Lanius, is scheduled to arrive within the next few hours. Using his position, Lanius is going to arrange for us to transport the weapon off the station to Jut-hakk's personal facility. As for your roles, you're to act as this ship's crew, assigned by Lanius from his base on Telia V. Once we have the weapon, all of you will have to work together to get it off.**" From a pouch on her belt she pulled out a small transmitter and tosses it toward Drem. Fitting easily in the palm of Drem's hand. It's about four inches long, two wide and an inch deep and sports one red button. "**The *Valiant* is set to track the transmitter so it will be able to locate you should the need to jump away arises. It can also be used to alert the *Valiant* of the pickup.**"
Petting the strill on the head, she avoids meeting Yuri's gaze. Tentia on its part, sprawls further out on the bunk, half making its way into Ka'ra's lap. Her focus turns to Yuri and his questions she can't seem to ignore any longer. "**I don't know much about his past. An attempt was made to gather records on him discreetly, but he's obviously using an alias.**She shrugs, hiding the reminder of a personal failure. "**As for his order of rag tag Force users… He started taking followers in force after the Mandalorian Wars, taking advantage of the dissension within the Jedi ranks. Those who didn't follow Revan into the Unknown Regions, but were dissatisfied with their place within the Jedi Order began following Jut-hakk. There were even padawans who were left astray in the wake of their mentor's death. Then there's the untrained Force users he was able to locate. These individuals were taken by lower ranking members for initial training. Once their skills were accounted for, they would have been taken as students by those higher up in the order.**"

Catching the transmitter, Drem looks to it and then to Ka'ra with a confused look. "**Wait a minute …**" he fumbled out, "**What do you mean 'all of you'? Where are YOU going to be?**" Drem looked to the transmitter again and furrowed his brow. *Need to find a place for this*, he thought, thinking back to all the things his Uncle's said about contraband. Kneeling on one knee, he carefully stuffed the gadget into the top of his boot and hoped to disguise it within the folds of cloth. *Great, just great … I decide to go out and have an adventure and what do I get? A suicidal Mandie on a mission to get us all skewered on a nut-job Jedi's lightsaber … Oh you know how to pick 'em Dremmin …*.

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Alicia** (2010-06-01 19:09:53)

Ka'ra shrugged again, "It's a precaution in case we're caught. Lanius and I will be providing the distraction you will need to get the weapon off the station. Since neither of us at that point can plan what will happen, its best to be prepared for the inevitable." She looks between the two men and then at the sleeping Kin. Finally she looks down at her lap, one hand still scratching the Strill behind the ears. "**Should neither of us make it off, then you will need to locate the data chip in my fighter on board the *Valiant*. Captain Prius will know how to activate it. It's important you carry on without us.**" She's quiet for a moment longer and then she stands, displacing Tentia from her lap. The strill gives a disgruntled yawn and glares at her then rolls over going back to sleep.
"**I have some things I need to attend to,**" she says abruptly, moving into the cargo area of the ship. She stops to stand over Alarick, watching him work for a moment before broaching what it was she needed. "**Are you good with demolitions?**" she asks, getting to the point.

Fiolla returns to the world of the active once again after she hears Ka'ra responding to questions. The young woman leans forward a bit in her seat, taking a closer look at all of her future team mates, before she finally asks a question of her own.
"Would there not be any questions asked due to how our group appear? It isn't every day you see such a ragtag band of people, at least I don't think so. Also what are the weapon policies aboard? I mean is it okay to carry around weapons or should we only carry easily concealed weaponry? Are there any particular procedures we should be aware of? Any special passwords?"

Emily reads through the information on the console and her eyes widen when she gets to one particular entry in the cargo manifest, and she gets up from her seat and starts heading toward the back of the ship looking for an entrance into the cargo bay to check it out herself and make sure that someone hasn't just tampered with the cargo logs.
She will be moving very quickly as she heads toward the back of the ship, clearly eager to verify whether the cargo logs are accurate or not.

Alarick sat by the work bench with one of the many pieces from his gun in his hands, the others carefully laid out. As he looked over the part he pulled out a file, carefully filing down the sharp corners. He continued to work on his gun, filing and cleaning up the parts he did not get to finish before the mission briefing. He also had a piece of fliplast to take note on how he could improve. As Ka'ra approached he put the flimsiplast in his pocket "Hu...am I good with demolitions?" he started as he began to assemble his gun "I would say I am. If it has a power pack I can find a way to make it explode. Not only that but I could make the explosion be about two to three time bigger than it normally would given a little luck." he said as the final piece of his gun slid into place. "So what do you want me rig up, and do you want timer or remote?" he asked standing up.

Ka'ra stops and turns to look at the group in the living quarters before heading into the bay. It seemed an odd question to Ka'ra especially coming from Fiolla. "**There isn't a uniform you're expected to conform to. The cargo crews were generally made up of hired individuals who showed aptitude in the work. Since occasionally an inspection by a Republic ship had to be carried out, discretion was key.**" She turns, leaning with one hand on the door jam in preparation of going through the door. "**As for weapons.. as long as you don't appear to be expecting a fight, I think you'll be fine.**" She glances back one last time, before going about her business in the cargo bay.
"**I need you to rig these crates of grenades. Remote detonation would be best,**" she says to Alarick, taking out the detonator from her belt and then indicates the two palettes of twenty crates each near the loading ramp. "**It needs to stand up to scrutiny and not be obvious its rigged.**" Holding out the detonator for Alarick to take, something seems to rest uneasily on her mind.

### **Sketchpad** (2010-06-02 12:11:57)

Listening to the discussion on weapons between Ka'ra and Fiolla, Drem considered a few things. *It's probably a good thing we HAVE these weapons, as I'm positive that we'll need them to get out of this rancor-bake. Bloody nass, what I wouldn't do for a few of my Uncle's old crew … they'd be good in this mess*. Looking briefly to Alarick, he thought, *Or at the very least, more trustworthy …*
Turning to Fiolla, Drem smirks a bit and pats his side arm. "**I wouldn't worry too much. Most of the ships I've been on it's expected to carry a weapon or two. You never know when you might run into pirates or shipjackers, and most of "The Law" understands that someone needs to protect themselves and their cargo. In fact, I'd be surprised if they even looked at them funny …**"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-02 14:01:30)

As Ka'ra left, Yuri leaned back on the bunk he was sitting on. He paid some slight attention to the conversation about weapons, and he had to agree with the Mandalorian woman: If they didn´t look like they were expecting a fight, hopefully they wouldn´t get into trouble. At least not until they started to tick people off by stealing secret weapons and such. He didn´t think too much off it.
Instead, he thought about what she had said about Jut-Hakk. It seemed he had been building his ragtag Force sect for some years, and that there were indeed fallen Jedi among their ranks. He knew what this meant, of course, but he sincerely hoped that he wouldn´t run into any familiar faces. Or at the very least, that he wouldn´t have to fight them.
There was something else though. Ka'ra had seemed strangely reluctant to talk to him about Jut-Hakk, and he suspected she knew more than she let on. So far, he had no reason to doubt her, and he wanted to beleive that she would not withhold information that could be critical, but he also didn´t like being left out of the loop. Closing his eyes, he reached out into the Force, searching for that presence he knew was there.
*Master, what should I do? I am certain she knows more than she is telling, but I am worried that pushing the issue might do more harm than good. Like the old Jedi Masters, she might have her reasons for hiding parts of the truth*

Alarick smiled "Well at least you gave me some what of a challenge. Good to know someone around here knows my skills, not that anyone else would really care." he muttered the last part as he looked detonator. He carefully took the detonator so as not to make it look like he was taking it from Ka'ra's hand. "So is this to cover our escape...or a distraction as we grab the weapon?" He walked back over to the work bench he started punching a few things in on his bracer computer as he continued "And who's going to be holding it, also I want to know if you have a problem if I put a program in my computer here so that I can detonate the crates as well. After all if something happens to you we'll still need a way to use this right?"
He set the detonator down and looked up at the crates "Oh do you know if they are all frag or do I have a mix?" He walked over to the crates and looked at the locks "Right I'll need to open these first. Care to give me a hand?" he asked pulling out his tool kit.

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Alicia** (2010-06-03 13:41:07)

Ka'ra smiles as Alarick turns away from her and begins asking his questions. Moving up next to him, she looks at the number on the crate and then enters a code. Looking at a second label she thinks for a moment before she enters a different code into a another. Lifting the open crates from their stacked position revealing more crates underneath, she sets them nearby on the floor "**Most are going to contain frag grenades. There's at least ten crates of stun grenades.**" After opening a third on the same palette she answers the rest of his questions. "**If it's still in the bay when you leave, then its to cover your escape. Lanius already has something planned to make a distraction should it be needed.**" She looks at another set of numbers and before long the fourth crate is open. "**Give the detonator to Fiolla. If the two of you have it that leaves a chance it will be used effectively.**" As each crate is opened she moves them nearby to an empty space in the cargo hold.
As Ka'ra talks, Alarick sets to work opening the other crates. On his own he is able to get three of the crates open by jury-rigging the locks themselves.
Emily is indeed able to locate the crates she's looking for and as Ka'ra and Alarick open each one it's evident that the cargo manifest was indeed accurate. Now seven crates of the twenty on one of the palettes have been opened. All but one are filled with frag grenades, the other has stun. The open crates reveal there are fifty grenades in each, surrounded by packing material.
In the living quarters, Tentia opens its eyes and seems to glare at everyone for a moment. Getting up it makes an easy jump to the bunk Kin is resting on. The 35kg creature of flabby skin and fur starts about making a nest out of Kin. Kneading with its claws it stretches out like a large cat.

Kin's eyes open slowly as the small beast tries to make a bed out of him. He's evidently a light sleeper and one who wakes up in a bad mood. Demonstrated by the rapidity that he swats the animal off of him and onto the metal floor. The nautolan instinctively checks his gun before looking around the room. He nodded at anyone present before checking through his gear again. Flechette launchers were certainly high maintenance weapons, moreso than any blaster at least. It wouldn't be any good if the thing jammed in the middle of a firefight, unless of course an enemy was holding it. Kin almost found the thought amusing, for anyone else to have the weapon they would have had to pry it from his dead, cold and rubbery fingers.

### **Vash** (2010-06-04 15:46:21)

"Right trust her with the trigger to the bomb, why do I see bad things happening in my future?" he asked himself "Ok let me see here, if we put the frags near the middle and then have the stun grenades near the top and edges that will give them a chance to be thrown away from the crates before they go off. You know now that I think about it you think they would notice a few grenades missing?" he asked Ka'ra as he started rigging the frag grenades "If not it might not be a bad idea to take a few for ourselves."
Alarick had already started writing the program to use his bracer computer as a second detonator when he stopped. The thought of their shuttle blowing up right as they make their escape passed through his mind "I just had a thought, what if they don't have time to unload the rigged pallet?" As he spoke he looked around and pulled a small torch out of his tool kit. He lit the torch and use it to burn two sides of the pallet, that way he could tell the two apart. He went back to rigging the crates taking a few grenades out, telling anyone who asked that he needed to make room for the rigging. *You know if I'm good enough to do this I could use this trick on anyone who is competing with me when I open my factory up*. The thought made him smirk as he pulled two more frags setting them aside.
As he looked at them he got another thought, perhaps he could use some of the spare frags in the stun crates to help throw the stun grenades further. As he thought about this he started pulling out some liquid cable "Hey if someone could help me I need to tie some of this around all the pins for the stun grenades then I need to attach them to the sides of the crates. as he moved the stun grenades around he placed a frag at the center bottom of each crate that was open, to help spread his little gift around "How long do we have?" he asked as more thoughts passed through his mind. He knew if he was given a little more time he could come up with something really nasty. As he looked around he noticed the barrels "Hey do you know what's in there?" he ask both girls "For that fact do you know what all we're carrying?" he asked with a wicked, almost evil, smile "After all we want to make sure they don't follow us."

"**Okay, so you don't like Mandies, but that's no reason to take it out on an animal, Laserbrain.**" Walking over the animal, he pulled out another bantha stick and snapped off a piece, offering it to the pet as he squatted to its level.

When Alarick indicates he needed someone to help him with tying the pins she steps forward and says, "I can help." and reaches for the cable indicated to begin stringing the pins.

"I guess I should really tell you this," Fiolla suddenly starts saying, leaning a bit back in her seat. She casts a quick glance over the rest of the team in the living area.
"I really would prefer if this information was kept discrete by all of you, but I feel you should all know. So it doesn't come as a sudden surprise."
She pauses, then waits a few seconds, before she continue.
"I was a part of the Jedi Order before it was destroyed. And I carry a lightsaber and is proficient with this, so do not be surprised if I'm suddenly forced to draw this."

Ka'ra begins to assist in setting up the trip for the grenades. "**I don't have the complete cargo manifest, but it should be in the computer. I don't see why you can't take what you need, just don't make it too noticeable from a cursory glance.**"
Though disgruntled at having been shoved from its makeshift nest created using Kin, Tentia eagerly looks at the proffered treat Drem holds out. Bouncing from one set of legs to another the creature squeaks excitedly is it waits to be passed the morsel. It carefully takes the piece and then bounds into the cargo bay towards Ka'ra. There's a loud crash as it attempts to perch on top of a series of loose crates.
Ka'ra looks up as the Strill bounds in with its treat then continues on with her work amused by her companions antics. Only when crates topple over does she give a loud, angry shout of. "**Gah! Wayii, Tentia! Gar di'jut. Slana'pir!**" She strides away from the work Alarick and Emily progress on and moves towards the dislodged crates. As she gets closer, Tentia leaps from the crates, half gliding from the perch, it's flabs of skin expanding as it catches air, and then runs back through the living area into the cockpit. Ka'ra then proceeds to curse under her breath in what can be suspected as Mando'a concerning her obvious displeasure as she picks up and secures the crates.

Other than of course these grenades, as well as some heavy blasters, and some battle armour."**
She then continues with stringing the grenades, attempting to gauge his reaction to the fact they are carrying a substantial amount of weaponry.

Alarick watched the Strill and cracked a smile, finely laughing when he heard Ka'ra curse it "No rest for the wicked I see." he turned and looked at Emily "Before you ask the fur ball is the purest form of evil." He took a deep breath and listened to Emily "Humm could be useful but what I want to know is what's in the barrels?" He stood up and made his way over to the barrels looking for some sort of label "This could prove to be a very nasty surprise but what I need as a way to hid the frags that would be attached. I really wish I had known about this before hand or I would have prepped this ship better. All I want is a way to eject the cargo or something like that."
At this point he was just rambling as ideas shot through his head "Perhaps I should find a way to fake some sort of order so that these barrels are left on the ship. That way they can be rolled off the landing ramp right before take off. That could back fire though due to us leaving the ramp open. Maybe we could empty one of the barrels and with a few mods, and healthy use of frags, turn it into a bomb or some type of mortar canon..." Alarick was now pacing back and forth as he let his ideas flow out, ignoring everyone else for the time being.

Taking a moment to himself, Drem took out his weapons and began cleaning them meticulously. Keeping an eye on his surroundings, he let his mind wander a bit while the others seemed busy. *So you've got a way out*, he thought, *now you need to think of a plan to make sure people can get out. In the years that you've been playing scout and guide, you've never lost anyone, Drem ole buddy. If the information is good, it should be as easy as making Tenraja Stew. But remember what Uncle Gym use to say about being easy … if it's too easy in planning, it's never that easy in life.* Snapping a piece into his carbine, he took a look around as he sighed. *I really wish that station was planetside …* 
Drem wasn't really paying attention Fiolla when she made her announcement, but once the words "Jedi Order" were said, he turned and listened. "**Wait. You're a Jedi? I thought they were all wiped out or something. Don't take this as an insult, but how'd you survive?**"

Emily looks at the barrels and thinks back to the manifest as Alarick spouts off his various ideas and then she remembers the only thing the manifest listed as being in barrels and says in a quick and slightly panicked tone of voice, **"You might want to be careful with those."** and then she steadies her voice and continues, **"They are filled with acids, emptying them out onto the ship wouldn't really be a good idea."**

"Laser Brain? Is that some kind of thinly veiled insult directed at these?!" Relied Kin harshly whilst pointing to his eyes. "I've seen people who are uneasy around cybernetics but they usually show some restraint before insulting someone who's carrying a semi automatic SK-2 Flechette Launcher." The Nautolan turned away from the bigot and towards Fiolla.
"So that's why you're here. Must say the other Jedi i've worked with were much taller. They never wanted to drink either." The recent insult seemed to be quickly forgotten as Kin thought back to when he'd served alongside a Jedi Guardian in the war. That was the only person he'd seen dismember multiple opponents without wanting to drink until the memories blurred afterwards. "What colour is it?" He asked, assuming she'd know he was referring the lightsaber he knew all jedi would carry.

*Cryptic as always, huh? Well, I guess I´ll have to make do…*
Relaxing his eyes a bit more, Yuri listened to the bickering of the other people in the living quarters. It seemed the Nautolan was quite the example of the sad war veteran who had seen enough battle to be scarred for life. He probably had the skills to back up his gruff attitude though. Yuri was tempted to advise him not to rely on the equipment he carried but when Fiolla started speaking, his interest shifted.
He wasn´t overly surprised by her revelation, he had suspected it ever since he first met her on board the ship. He hadn´t recognized her though, so it was quite unlikely she had any clue as to who he was. And he preferred to keep it that way. Without opening his eyes or even sitting up again, he spoke right out.
"She´s no Jedi. The Jedi Order is gone, in case you hadn´t noticed"

Fiolla gives Drem a sad smile and then shakes her head in response to his questions and comments.
"The Jedi Order came to an end and truly many of my brethren died, but there are still survivors. Just like those Jedi previously mentioned. Some Jedi survived the destruction of the Order and has found other ways, some seeking out alternate ways of mastering the Force, some putting the Force in the background as they find other ways of survival. Though many of the Order come to an end since the Sith are chasing the survivors." the young Jedi explains to him.
She then turned to Kin and gave him a shrug.
"I never became a Jedi Knight, I was only a Padawan when it happened, someone still learning the ways of the Force. That might be why they were taller. Or perhaps it is simply because I am a young woman. As for the not drinking, then it is simply because we need to have clear minds when we are in balance with the Force. Alcoholic beverages will affect our perception and a wrong step can easily lead one on the path to the Dark Side." she explains to the Nautolan.
It is at that point that she notices Yuri's comment and she frowns a bit, her eyes narrowing just slightly, before she seems to realize her annoyance could lead to far darker emotions. She takes a deep breath before she replies.
"Being a Jedi is not simply about being part of an Order of others like yourself, it is a philophy by which you live your life, a way of which you perceive the Force. The Jedi Order may be no more, but there are still Jedi. It is the same as if an Alderaanian lost his homeworld, he would still be Alderaanian, he would simply have no place he truly belonged. It is the same with the Jedi Order."

Yuri smiled a bit before he sat up. She was a lot like him, after all, still striving to hold up the Jedi ideals. He wondered who had been her master. Still, it seemed that she was very much set in her ways as the Jedi had taught her, and that he found a bit amusing. While the knowledge of the Jedi Masters were vast, they were far from omnipotent, that was one of the first things his master had taught him. To always think for himself, always question, always investigate. Because personal growth was just that, personal, and no one else could help you with it.
Throwing back the hood of his cloak that had followed him when he sat up, he looked at Fiolla. He decided to try and goad her a bit, tease her to try and reveal the amount of control she possessed, and learn more about her.
"So, you claim there are still Jedi in the Galaxy? Call me a skeptic, but I haven´t seen a lightsaber blade for some time now. Don´t make me believe that the Jedi that sat back and watched during the Mandalorian Wars still exists. Don´t tell me that the Jedi who saw their own turn against them during the Civil War has remained unchanged. None of those Jedi remain, they are all changed, and apparently they have all decided to leave the Galaxy to its fate"

Fiolla shakes her head at Yuri's words, but keeps her emotions under wrap. She is a Jedi, even if only a Padawan, not an undisciplined youngling.
"Jedi are not all about the Lightsaber, even if some might think so. Our lightsabers are important, certain approaches to the force can only be channeled through such a blade, yet what truly makes one a Jedi is your way of life, the philosophy, the creed which you define yourself by. It is not solely defined by the Jedi Order, though in the Order we were amongst others possessing the same view of the world. And as for why the Jedi hide? That is easily answered, there is great danger in the Galaxy right now and two things by which a Jedi must live are patience and wisdom. The masters that may perhaps live are in hiding because the time is not right for their revealing, while the younger may simply have found another path in life. If I settled down as a farmer somewhere doesn't mean that I have completely giving up the philosophies and traditions by which I was raised, it simply means that I would be a Jedi who would be working as a farmer and it would be so for as long as I kept living by the Jedi ways."

Hearing Kin rant, Drem paid more attention to Fiolla and Yuri. "**You ask me,**" he piped in, "**if you're indeed one of Jedi training, then maybe the universe has some hope after all. I can honestly say that, while I've never known a Jedi, I always felt a bit safer knowing that their lightsabers were protecting the Core Worlds while I was out exploring the outer regions …**"
Turning to Kin, Drem shook his head. "**If you're so thinly skinned to take what I said as an actual insult, than maybe you should see a medic or something. Trust me when I say this, if I wanted to honestly insult you because you've got some artificial parts, I could come up with something far more interesting and intelligent than 'laserbrain'. Oh, and another thing, the next time you threaten me or that pet, don't be looking to me to pull you out of trouble, got me?**"

Ka'ra's cursing gradually subsides as she secures the last crate Tentia had knocked over. Now grim faced she stalks into the living area and past into the cockpit, picking up her blaster rifle from the storage compartment by her bunk on the way and then closes the hatch to the cockpit behind her.
In the cargo bay, Alarick's and Emily's progress on rigging the bombs progresses smoothly. At the rate things are progressing one palette will be finished in a half hour.

Yuri shook his head, partially as part of the act he was putting on, but also partially because he was a bit saddened to hear that the young woman seemed so set in the old ways. He watches Ka'ra pass through the living quarters and close herself in the cockpit, but then he turns his eyes back to Fiolla.
"So you still cling to the ways of the Jedi as they were before the wars? How can you be so certain that those ways are the right ways? Aren´t those the ways that Revan and Malak was trained in, as well as all the other Jedi who turned on the Order? Are you so certain that the failings laid solely on the students that you refuse to acknowledge that maybe the Jedi teachings does not hold all the answers?"
He paused for a moment, hoping he wasn´t coming on too strong. He stroke a hand over his shaved head before he continued.
"Answer me something. Did you fight in the Mandalorian Wars? In the Civil War?"

Alarick looked at the barrels "Acid..yes very bad for ship hulls...hum now theres an idea. Acid tipped missiles for soldiers..very effective against speeders and heavy armor." as he spoke he was typing down notes in his bracer computer and had completely forgotten what he was doing and about the mission. He stopped pacing as he ran his index finger along his jaw line and looked off into space.
He narrowed his eyes and looked at the barrels then looked around. His mind had snapped back as he snapped his fingers "We need another palette...I have a wicked idea" he smiled "How good are you with explosives? I want to try and rig something up with a frag or two and the barrels, mainly if we can get another palette. The only thing is we need to make another detonator, but if this works I guarantee no one will follow us."

The young Jedi shakes her head at Yuri's words, then sighs, before replying.
"You do not truly possess the insight and the wisdom to understand. I am following the philosophy of the Jedi, yet there are many interpretations of this philosophy, this code. The Jedi Council interpreted the code in one way, Malak and Revan another. The philosophy in itself is simple, that one must withstand the temptations of the Dark Side, that there is the Force as the unifier that binds the universe together. Thus even without there being a Jedi Council one can still follow the philosophy, whether it is the one strictly enforced by the Jedi Council or one of the numerous other variations that Jedi scholars has come up with through time. Or perhaps one simply follow the rules as they interpret it themselves. So let me ask you again, what is so horrible about following the code of the Jedi in order to avoid the temptations of the Dark Side? Would you rather watch me fall, watch me slaughter innocents, become a part of the Sith Order?"

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-09 08:00:07)

Smiling, Yuri offered a small nod towards Fiolla.
**"I may lack some insight, but I think we´ve stumbled on the heart of the issue here. You claim to follow the philosophy of the Jedi, but at the same time you admit that there are many interpretations of this philosophy. If so, then how can anyone truly know what are the pure Jedi teachings? Perhaps it would be better for everyone to just open their eyes and deal with reality as it is, rather than cling to whatever philosophies they´ve been taught their whole lives"**
Inspired by the people tinkering with their weapon around him, he pulled out his blaster pistol, and started to check its functionality. He gave Fiolla a quick glance and continued talking as he worked with the weapon.
**"But what do I know, I´m just a simple bounty hunter, completely blind to the amazing world of the Jedi. But you didn´t answer my question"**

"What exactly is so hard for you to understand about the philosophy? The Jedi is defined by the code which we follow. This has nothing to do with the Jedi Order, it has nothing to do with Revan and Malak, it has nothing to do with the Mandalorian Wars. The Jedi Code is actually very simple guidelines to live by, it is up to the individual to follow the philosophy as they interpret it. Was the Jedi Order right? Were Malak and Revan right? Or did none of them make the right decision? I do not know, I do not care. What I care about is my own personal adherence to the creed which I follow, it is about what I feel is right, about what I feel is wrong. And I follow the philosophy about the Jedi to determine what is right and what is wrong," Fiolla explains to Yuri, raising her voice just slightly, as if to make her point.

With a swift motion, Yuri detached the power cell from the weapon to check it for damage, and them slipped it back into the pistol. He had noticed the raise in Fiolla´s voice, and suspected he was getting to her. At least, he had managed to get the confession out of her that he had been looking for. She still clung to the Jedi Code to tell her what was right or wrong.
"I guess my point is I think you should let go of the Jedi philosophy and instead follow your own instincts. The Jedi Code won´t solve the problems of the Galaxy for you, no matter how much you hold on to it"

Drem, having said his peace, was content with listening to the discussion between Fiolla and Yuri. *An actual Jedi in our midst*, he thought, *Who would've knew? Might actually manage to survive with her help. I realize she's just a Padawan, but still, if she's tuned into The Force, maybe she can sense things that could give us an edge … or maybe she may even have some foresight …*
Pondering that for a second, Drem turned to Fiolla and, while trying not to interrupt her discussion with Yuri, asked, "**Wait, if you've had Jedi training, is it possible that you have some kind of ability to see the outcome of our mission? From the stories I've been told, Jedi have some pretty hefty 'mystical' powers … is that one of them? Or is there some way that you can tell when we'll have an issue with someone at this station we're going into?**"

Fiolla sighs and then shakes her head, leaning back a bit after hearing Yuri's comments.
"You say to trust instincts, yet instincts are the path to the Dark Side. Fear and anger are two of the strongest instincts and one must master his or her feelings to achieve the peace and serenity required to wield the force with no risk. The lack of such discipline is a recipe for disaster."
The young Jedi then looks over at Drem, replying to his question with another headshake.
"The Masters of the Order possess far greater insight into the paths of the Force, they could achieve some very limited knowledge about the future. But I was just a Padawan, being nowhere near possessing the mastery and insight into the ways of the force to try and interpret it."

"Some sort of acid distribution system?...You make it sound so technical." he smirked "It's no where near that level. It's just some barrels of acid with a few frags in the middle of them. Like I said though I need o make something to start the chain reaction. Anyways I still need to rig up the two pallets of frags. Would be helpful if Ka'ra was still around to help but I don't think that's going to happen. Anyways as soon as you're done there go find a pallet then get some of the others to help with moving the barrels of acid, unless we have some sort of lift we can use. In all honesty I only really trust Ka'ra, and now you, to not frak this up and get us killed."
Alarick walked back over to the pallets of frags and started working on rigging them up. Suddenly he spoke up with looking at Emily "So you mind me asking what's your story?" As he finished rigging the frags and setting the detonators he helped Emily finish with the stun grenades and placed them on the pallets with the frags "Ok lets get to work on my last little going away gift." He glanced around the room and spotted the lift "Great now we jut load the barrels on the pallet, strap them together,place the frags, and set you something to blow it all up" he grinned "piece of cake." After moving the barrels he grabbed some spare parts and set a device to give them thirty seconds after he activated it.

Emily nods along with Alarick's instructions for what to do once she finishes with stringing the grenades, and when he asks what her story is she looks at him as if weighing up exactly what to say and after a long pause she shakes her head saying, **"I don't mind you asking, but there isn't really that much to tell. I've been on my own for nearly as long as I can remember, doing a bit of this and a bit of that to survive."** and then after a short pause she continues with, **"What about you?

With Emily and Alarick working hard to complete the first set of distractions, the work is quickly finished in the half hour. After gathering the others to help, including Ka'ra who emerges from the cockpit, the barrels of corrosive material is moved, the makeshift detonator is made by Alarick, and the final bomb is made.
Everything in the cargo bay is back in order by the time the timer on the navicomputer beeps, indicating the arrival to the so far relatively unknown destination.
Ka'ra makes her way to the cockpit, once again taking a seat in the copilot's chair. Bringing the ship out of hyperspace, she powers up the thrusters and takes the transport confidently into the asteroid field looming ahead. "**Drem, take a seat,**" she calls. "**You're listed as the pilot so they're going to want to talk to you.**" Turning her attention back to piloting, she dodges between two large asteroids as they intercept to collide into one another.
Glancing over at Drem, she adds, "**You won't have to say much, just give them our ID number. When they ask for our permit, transmit it over. You're carrying goods and passengers for the station from Telia V**." Ahead the asteroids thin out, till only one large asteroid fills the viewscreen, which she seems to be aiming the shuttle for.
There's no sign that there's even anything out there until the shuttle's comm beeps. Ka'ra looks over at Drem expectantly.

Drem, looking a bit surprised and perplexed, took a moment to have everything sink in before he realized the comm was beeping. "**Aw, grife,**" he swore before flipping on the comm. "**This is Shuttle E3452, over?**" He blurted out in a casual way. He waited patiently for the docking official to respond, shooting Ka'ra a '*We'll-Talk-About-This-Later*' look. It was obvious that he didn't appreciate the last minute approach, but attempted to appear capable (especially after his initial display).

**"My story…"** he paused as he put the finishing touches on the acid barrels and strapped them into place **"Well it started when I was just a kid. I was always taking things apart and putting them back together, you know learning how it all worked. I had plenty of gear to mess with, after all my dad is one of the top weapons and armor engineers."** He took a breath as he stepped back and looked at his three gifts with a smile **"Not to shabby for a last minute jerry-rig job. Anyways by the time I was five I managed to build a working light repeater attached to a set of medium battle armor. Only problem was the armor was a prototype that my dad just built. Needless to say that didn't go over well. After surviving that continued to build weapons and armor. I think I was twelve when one of his contractors spotted one of my rifles.
"Nothing really special about it. I just shave a bit of the weight off, made so right handed and left handed people could use. I also adjusted the scope to take any light in the area and magnify it giving the shooter a better shot but I installed a basic program to make it return to a normal scope as soon as the gun hit a well lit area. My father took credit and the rifle was put into production. After that I spent seven years building armor and weapons for my father. All the time my father took the credit. Well the time came when I was old enough to get a job and of course my father offered one to me. I learned a lot of things but in two years, how to reprogram computers and droids to get them to do what I wanted and how to manipulate to get them to see things my way, so I could get access to restricted projects and material. As soon as I turned nineteen I left the company determined to make my own company so I can prove that I'm better than my father. This here is just a small taste of my work"** he said pulling out his pistol holding so Emily could hold it and look over it.
**"see the wires leading to the barrel and were most of the energy comes from for the shot, by dividing into the three parts and waiting till the last moment to bring them together it allows the blaster bolt to be just a bit denser, thus doing more damage without draining the power pack faster. The other thing ins the longer barrel, it's like the old slugthrowers only I added specialized stabilizers to improve the accuracy."** Alarick looked up when he felt the ship shift **"I'm guessing we just dropped out of light speed. Shall we see who our lives are entrusted to till we land?"**

Ka'ra with a mischievous smile turns her attention to the controls in front of her, apparently well aware of the uncomfortable situation Drem has been placed in. Keeping a steady course, she powers down the engines, allowing the minimum thrust to take the shuttle closer to the station. Ever wary, her eyes stay on the sensors for any signs of any dangerous asteroids. After a small bit of static a male voice comes through clearly over the channel. "**This is Acheron station, please transmit identification code.**" Taking the initiative Ka'ra presses a series of buttons at the central computer transmitting the correct permit. Once again she throws Drem a smile as she goes back to looking out the viewscreen and the sensors, the shuttle still drifting closer to the asteroid station Acheron.
A long moment of silence draws out and then finally. "**Shuttle E3452, you may proceed to landing in bay 1.**" With that the comm clicks off, landing control leaving the pilot to figure things out. A hidden bay door on the asteroid begins to open, revealing where the ship was to land. With the comms out Ka'ra speaks up, not yet having powered up the engines to proceed.
"**I'll go make sure everyone is ready if you think you can handle this.**" Not waiting for Drem's response, she stands with a laugh and a pat on his back and makes her way toward the back of the shuttle to check on the others.

As Ka'ra left the room, Drem looked to the controls and let out a soft Ubeninal curse, **"Henga t'Ulra … that woman is certifiable." Pressing a few buttons, he powered up the engines and began to make his landing approach. *Okay, Drem … nice and steady,* he thought. *This isn't all that different than the Republic scouts you've piloted. No fancy tricks.* As he eased the ship down, he wanted nothing more than to have a smooth approach …

*And there we go…stuck in the old patterns. I hope for your sake that you will realize that things are not as simple as they tell you int the Temple…*
Realizing that little more would be gained by arguing the matter there and then, Yuri decided to back down for now.
"Very well, I rest my case. But by your own words, there are those who possess far greater understanding on these matters than yourself. Perhaps you do not know everything just yet"
Of course, Yuri was well aware that he could not claim to know everything about the Force either, far from it. But he also didn´t try to pass off his views as absolutes. Felling the ship shudder he figured they had left hyperspace, a feeling that was augmented by Ka'ra´s emergence from the cockpit. Getting up from the bed, he placed his gun back in its holster and looked at the Mandalorian woman.
"Time to go to work?"

"I have not claimed to know everything. I simply said I was a Jedi, because I am embracing the Jedi philosophy, which guides my path, so that I feel less temptation from the Dark Side," the young Jedi says to Yuri, shaking her head at him. Then she gives Ka'ra a faint smile, obviously fake, as she moves into the cockpit.
"So, we there soon?" Fiolla asks the pilot, as she slides into her seat, one of the seats which holds no ship controls. As she does this she takes a few deep breaths to center herself, forcing the fantasies in which she tortures Yuri out of her mind. A Jedi is in control of her emotions, she does not let the emotions control her actions.

**"Should be setting down momentarily,"** Drem responded to Fiolla in a gruff manner. It was pretty obvious that he was a bit nervous and maybe a little frustrated with the games he'd been part of. **"Hey, is it just me, or is our 'Field Commander' a little Bantha-Poodo crazy? I dunno about the rest of you, but I'm feeling more and more like I'm just a piece on a Dejarik table to that woman."** He hadn't turned from the view port, nor had his hands left the controls as he spoke, trying to at least fake the appearance of confidence in his piloting skills. Deep down, Drem knew he was a good pilot. He'd been flying ships like this since he was a sprout and would normally have trust in his abilities. But, between this and having 'The Button' in his care, he wondered how well he'd be able to pull this off. Sure, he was an okay liar, but a con man? That was more Uncle Gym. *But you're in this situation now*, he thought, *best make the best of it …* Before Fiolla had a chance to answer, Drem asked half-serious, **"So, know any good Jedi tricks that can make this mission go smoother?"**

Fiolla is caught a bit off-guard by that question, which causes her to spend a few seconds considering what she knew and what she could use. Then she gives a small shrug, followed by a little nod. "I do possess some talent for using the force, in particular I know the Jedi mind trick. Hopefully there are those who are weak-willed enough. Other than that, well, it's all situational I guess, so it's mostly something I'll use when it is suitable."

Ka'ra nods to Yuri as she moves to the side to let Fiolla pass into the cockpit. The young Mandalorian woman contemplates her peer for a moment as she does so then moves further into the living quarters to where she had stored her gear. "**We should be landing soon.**" Picking up her pistol, she looks it over, checking the clip, she puts it back in its holster attached to her leg. She does the same to her newly cleaned rifle before slinging it across her back. She places her bandolier of grenades over her chest and then looks down as she adjusts her gauntlets. Making a sharp fist, they arc with energy and then it dissipates as she releases the gesture. "**With any luck, we'll be in an out.**" She says with a smile before finally putting her helmet on.
Once Drem maneuvers the shuttle closer to the base, a tractor beam activates automatically piloting the shuttle safely into the bay. With a soft thud the shuttle touches down and it takes only a moment for the shuttle's supports to adjust under the gravity of the station. The exhaust gives a sharp hiss as the engines begin to shutdown under Drem's direction.
As the ship sets down, Ka'ra makes her way to the ramp, looking Emily over with a slight nod of approval and a reassuring hand on the girl's shoulder. "**Stick with me, ad'ika. Do as I say, not as I do. Tayli'bac?**"

Emily looks at Ka'ra and nods saying, **"I understand."** in a rote fashion as if she has had to say it many times, and is no longer even really paying attention to what she is being asked not to do, and then she turns back to Alarick, smiling at him and handing him back the pistol he had offered to her for examination and says, **"It definitely looks like a excellent piece must have taken you hours to make it."**
She then stands ready looking curiously at the ramp leading out of the ship, wondering just what is going to met them.

**"Well then"**
Yuri rises from the bunk he has been sitting on and gets ready to follow Ka'ra down the ramp. He adjusts the pistol holster at his side that have slipped slightly, and pulls up the hood of his poncho. Though the likelihood that someone would recognize him might be slim, he decides it better to be safe than sorry.

**"I've heard that too many times to count. So I guess it's show time."**
He took in a deep breath as he holstered the pistol and straightened his coat out **"So who am I on the boat? I don't really fit the "hard labor" type. If you want me to be in charge of this thing. I have yet to meet anyone who can lie better than me."** Alarick add with a small smile. He had his reasons for trying to take this role, the main one was that he didn't take orders well. After all he was out to start his own company and taking orders was not something the a CEO does.

Drem let out a sigh of relief as the ship landed smoothly. Smirking to himself, he thought, *Okay, that went pretty good. Now to be ready to get the frak outta here.* Looking around, he could hear movement in the back of the ship. Looking to Fiolla, he said, **"Well, looks like everyone's disembarking … "** Not one to miss a good show, Drem walked to the ramp, grabbing his gear on the way. *Remember the ole Galactic Scout rule*, he thought, *Always be prepared.*
Walking down the ramp, he took a good look around, curious about the innards of the station ...

Fiolla gets up from her seat, checks her sleeve for her weapon and then hurries after the others, while making sure once again that she has brought everything she might need.
As she walks down the ramp she takes a quick glance around, ready to defend herself, but still trying to appear as casual as possible. "I hate this part," she mutters, mostly to herself.

As soon as the ship is settled on the hanger deck, Ka'ra presses the controls allowing the ramp to lower. Pausing only for a moment she descends first. Approaching the ramp is a lone deck hand, dressed in tech coveralls he clearly helps to maintain the deck and its payload of ships. He looks up to address the first one off the ship, opening his mouth to speak. Taking in Ka'ra he stops, his mouth hanging open slightly in obvious shock.
"**Speak**," Ka'ra barks. "**You're wasting my time.**"
Overcoming his initial shock, he nods enthusiastically, "**Yes… Er.**" He looks down at his pad once more, then back up at Ka'ra. "**I need your pilot to verify the cargo and have his crew assist in the unloading.**"
"**No**," Ka'ra says simply, and looks behind her at Drem, indicating her head for him to proceed. "**They aren't here to do *your* work…**" she pauses a moment to look the man up and down. "**Chief in the future you better have a more significant reason than this bureaucratic nonsense to delay me.**" As she moves to walk past the man, she stops a mere few inches from him and faces him. Though she is shorter than the tech, she still seems to loom over him. "**We will be requiring the shuttle today, make sure it is ready.**"
**"Yes, ma'am!"** The tech waits for Drem to sign for the cargo before hurrying over to another part of the hanger bay, as Ka'ra turns on her heel to proceed walking through the hanger in the other direction. She looks behind her only once to ensure everyone is following.
The hanger bay to Acheron station is of a decent size, being able to accommodate at least four of the shuttles. Only one other landing pad is in use by a light freighter currently undergoing some repairs. Boxed lines in the middle of the four landing zones show the presence of moving platforms indicating the possible storage of other ships below the deck. Walking through the bay, the presence of tech hands as they go about their work is evident, a few of them look up curiously, but then quickly go back to work. Storage containers and other repair equipment are scattered along the edges of the platforms and bulk droids move about transferring crates.
Moving with purpose, Ka'ra leads the team out of the bay and into a long hallway. Outside the doors to the bay, two armored guards stand on duty. They glance over the new comers as they pass, but otherwise take no other notice even at the heavily armed Ka'ra. Not giving the party much chance to talk, she moves at a fast pace past two more guard stations and then into a lift.

Nodding to the tech, Drem takes a quick look over the manifest with as much grim seriousness that he could give without being over the top. *Sweet Matron of the Jedi!* he thought to himself, trying very much not to look surprised and keep up his facade. Swallowing back a lump of nervousness, he quickly signed the pad in quick, jagged signature that only his mother could probably read. In an attempt to play up his role, Drem went to say something cool like 'looks good' or 'carry on', but was cut short by the tech's quick speed. Letting out a bit of a 'hmph', he followed the others, lagging towards the back as he looked around discreetly-.

Kin exits the ship and then the bay, following Ka'ra though not too closely. He eyed the large room as they walked through it, nothing looked particularly different than the other two dozen or so hangers Kin had seen in the past. His hand was always on the Flechette launcher hanging at it's side, though not on the trigger. It reassured him somewhat, being caught unaware by the enemy with no weapon to hand would lead to a fool's death. He wasn't afraid of death but only as long as it was meaningful, dying to a rookie 'mistake' wasn't his idea of an honourable sacrifice.
Kin still hadn't ruled out the possibility of this being part of an elaborate plan on Ka'ras part to trap them all. He followed her for now though, there would be no point in getting dismissed from the mission and sent back to the Titan's Valiant so complete a few more hundred event-less guard shifts. No-one else who quite had the same skillset as him anyway he thought. No one else he knew of had survived having their ship crash into a planet around them, the hull and crew burning as it's crippled body entred the atmosphere. It would almost have been some kind of achievement if it weren't for the crewmates and friends he'd lost, Kara being the loss which stung the most.
Kin shook his head as if to dismiss the thoughts, it was time to focus on the mission he told himself as they passed the two armed guards.

Emily followed along very close behind Ka'ra her eyes darting around the hanger looking for all the world to see like a girl that hasn't been on a space station before and just drinking in the sights and sounds, only those paying close attention would realise that the sights she spent the most time looking at where the various entrances and exits to the hanger, the people in the hanger, and the weaponry worn by the guards outside it.
She stays quiet as she walks, at least until they get out of earshot of the guards in the hallway and then she says, **"It looks like they are expecting visitors."** while looking back toward the armoured guards.

Ka'ra doesn't say anything till the lift. Once the doors close with everyone inside, she presses the button to head up to the top level. The level where those currently residing on the station of Jut-hakk's Order trained and lived. "**The guards by the bay were standard procedure. The stations are added security due to the presence of Jut-hakk and the weapon. You can expect such stations all through out that level especially around the labs and control room. The other two levels won't be as heavily guarded."** She pauses the elevator just before the doors would open. "**That doesn't mean you shouldn't be on your guard. This level will be inhabited by mainly Force users and the most prominent of Jut-hakk's staff. Lanius's office is in the middle of it all.**"
The doors finally open and as Ka'ra proceeds down the hallway you see she was right about there not being any sign of a guard watch. The halls are however far from empty as you pass the occasional sentient going about their business. They're dressed in dark robes, from brown to black. While not all of them bear a lightsaber, they carry a weapon of some sort and it can only be assumed they are proficient with its use. As they pass Yuri and Fiolla can sense them reaching out with the Force, probing for some sort of identity.

"I really hope we avoid confrontations," Fiolla says to the team, as she follows them and Ka'ra. "If not, I have a very bad feeling about this..." With that said, the young girl sends out invisible probes of the force, to get a better impression of how many force users are near the group. The young girl had a very bad feeling about all of this, starting to feel less and less certain that she and the rest of the group were doing the right thing, since this did seem much more dangerous than she would prefer. No Fear, she repeats in her mind, trying to calm her feelings, yet she's not as calm as she tries to appear.

*'Inhabited by mainly Force Users'?* Drem echoed Ka'ra's words of warning in his head. *What's the encore? Trained hunting Gundarks? A double headed Kryat Dragon that's blaster proof?* He quickly choked back his doubts when the door opened. Still keeping up the back of the group, he examined the guards while trying desperately to not look obvious. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew that, if the legends were true, his weapons would be as useful as a hydrospanner in a fight against the forces within. Fiolla's words echoed into his thoughts, *'I have a very bad feeling about this …'* Drem found it hard to deny such foolproof logic ...

Yuri follows quietly behind Ka'ra, a collected calm on his face. He didn´t need the Force to see that some of the others were not so calm. Of course, he suspected, he probably had had the most experience with Force users...or at least in battling them. He shrugged visibly as he remembered some of his encounters during the Civil War. Revan´s assassins had come after him and his master, time and again, during their search for ways to halt the Sith advance.
As they passed robed figures in the corridor, Yuri keeps his eyes forward, but he casts glances at those they meet, trying to place them among the various Force using organization found in the Galaxy. He can feel the mental probes extended towards the group by them, which is the whole reason he tries to appear as calm as he does. He never got very skilled at hiding his own presence from other Force users, though he has acquired some amount of skill in it.

Emily follows Ka'ra down the hallway her footsteps landing lightly on the floor, and her eyes studying each of the robed sentients that they encounter in the hallway curiously. Especially those carrying lightsabers rather than other more conventional weaponry. She doesn't really seem to be too worried about the force users, more curious then anything else almost as if she hasn't seen what one could do before.
She also tries to keep track of which way and roughly how far the elevator is as they move through the hallway just in case they need to make a quick exit at some later point in time. Her eyes look down every corridor as they pass checking to see how far they look to extend and whether they might provide an alternate route.

The Force users pass by, apparently taking no further interest in the newcomers other than to send Ka'ra a glare as they pass. To the observer they can be seen carrying weapons from vibrosword to one carrying a discblade their place of origin also seems shrouded in mystery. Ka'ra for her part seems to just ignore their leers and walks with purpose down one hallway and then another. To anyone paying attention it's easy to keep track of which hallways she goes down, but otherwise they all look the same.
Entering one particular hallway containing a series of doors, she stops in front of one toward the far end. She presses on the panel next to the door in a set sequence, waiting a moment she presses another button and the doors open. Motioning for everyone to enter, she waits to enter last.
The room is sparsely decorated and consists mainly of a desk with only a single chair behind it. Apparently any visitors to this office are expected to stand. There's a door behind the desk and as the last of the party enter a tall, young man in his early twenties enters the room. The dark robes he wears make a sharp contrast with his light blonde hair. At his belt a lightsaber swings visibly beside a blaster pistol.
He eyes each of the new comers as you settle into the room, his expression growing slightly softer as he sees Fiolla and then Ka'ra finally enter.
The door closes behind Ka'ra and makes her way toward the front of the room. Finishing his initial evaluation of the team before him his gaze leaving Emily last with a slight frown.
"**Bic morut'yc jorhaa'ir?**" Ka'ra asks, breaking the silence.
The man looks at her and nods. " **'Lek, a'bic dar'cuy,**" he replies tersely. **"I would offer you a better welcome.**" He starts, addressing the rest of you. **"But I'm afraid we're running short on time. Come we have some things to discuss.**" He motions toward the still open door behind his desk where he had entered from.

Walking into the room, Drem takes a look around. **"Nice place,"** he muttered to himself. **"Glad to see they put out a nice spread for us …"** Snapping to a quick silence as the newcomer enters the room, he listens carefully to the conversation that Ka'ra has. But, not understanding a lick of Mando'a, Drem pondered what they could possibly be talking about. Fortunately, before he lost his inner monologue, the newcomer began speaking in basic, but that didn't stop the curious scout from being a bit paranoid. Looking to the door that was gestured at, Drem took the stance he's had since leaving the ship: taking the back and keeping an eye out for strange behavior. Unfortunately, the whole thought of being here was becoming stranger and stranger ...

*Well, this was surprising…*
Yuri had mostly been following silently, taking note of the various weapons carried by those they met, and the diversity in Force traditions represented they meant. But upon seeing the young man, he discreetly raised an eyebrow. He raised his hand to pull the hood forward a bit. He doubted the man would recognize him, though since Yuri had recognized him, it would be possible.
He listened to the words exchanged between Lanius and Ka'ra. He had picked up some bits of the Mandalorian language in his life, but only random words and expressions. He would like to know more of it though. However, now was not the time to ask Ka'ra for a language class.

Alarick watched as everyone did their thing, he really didn't care about why everyone was acting they why they were. As long as it didn't get him killed. He was very bored with everything and was spending more time trying to figure out how to entertain himself then he was paying attention to the mission. He had been taking note of things he had seen as they were walking around, if for no other reason than to keep his mind from wondering too far from the mission.

As Fiolla sensed several force users, while trying to mask her own force, she continued to follow Ka'ra, dropping to the back of the group, only passing Ka'ra once, when she enters the room containing Lanius. In particular the young Jedi spent her time making notice whether or not she could spot any lightsabers, other than the one carried by Lanius. After entering the room with the rest, she the other Jedi a small nod and a faint smile. She does stand at the back of the group though, ready to react if any hostiles should enter though the door. She does frown a bit after hearing the Mandalorian, not liking when she misses part of a conversation.
When Lanius gestures towards the door, Fiolla gives a nod and gives a gesture to show the others that they should enter. She herself is waiting until the rest have entered, as she's guarding the back. This is potentially hostile territory and a lack of vigilance, if only for a moment, can mean the difference between life and death.

**"Are you sure of them Lanius? I do not need incompetence hindering my mission."**
The question comes from an apparition leaning against a far wall in the rear corner of the room. A pair of golden eyes snap open to fully appraise each entrant as they make their way into the antechamber, weighing and judging each. It frowns to itself and shakes what would be its head, before pushing itself off of the wall and gliding forward.
As the apparition strides towards the table where Lanius stands, it resolves itself into the form of a very-pale skinned man with straight jet black hair, slightly above average height, and a slim build. The wraith is dressed in a fringer's jacket and slacks of a color to match his hair, and a deep blue sleeveless undershirt that almost seamlessly blends in with the black. Covering his hands are a pair of well-worn combat gloves, and on his feet a sturdy pair of boots.
Although the choice of clothing aided the Nagai in blending in with the scant shadows in the room, its a wonder that with those burnished eyes and the wane complexion that those that entered the room had not spotted him sooner. He gives the faintest of nods to the armored warrior before he continues his appraisal, glossing over Yuri, Kin, and Fiola, before his frown grows deeper as it lands on the twitchy spacer, the unfocused fop, and lastly the little girl.

With Lanius ushering into the room where the Nagai is, he is among the last to enter. The room off the office appears to be the living quarters he was assigned to. As sparse as the anteroom, the quarters contain an unused bed on the further most wall from the door. A door to the left opens into a smaller dark room, which could be assumed to be the fresher. On the right a small sitting area with a couch resting against the wall. A table covered in flimsiplast and a scattering of datapads has two chairs both of which pushed out shows evidence of use.
Ka'ra is last to enter the room. Upon spotting the Nagai her attention immediately turns to Lanius pulling him back into the office before he can enter and voices an annoyed question to him. "**Tion'ad ha'ran ibic?**"
Lanius holds up his hands in a calming gesture. **Hiib'ic pakod. Kaysh burc'ya teh te ruug'la tuure.**" As he speaks he doesn't take his eyes off her T-visor.
Ka'ra looks back over at the Nagai, her expression hidden by her helmet. "**Gar jate'shya serimir ti'bic. Mhi sha vutyc ca'nara.**" Having said her piece she walks into the room, heading straight for the Nagai."**Lanius has called you friend. He doesn't make such claims lightly.**" She starts in her accented lilt. Pausing for a moment she seems to evaluate him. Finally she holds out her gauntleted hand. "**I am Ka'ra Bralor,**" she introduces herself formally.
Lanius shaking his head in amusement, closes the door to the anteroom behind him."**Alright then. Before we start I would like to mention that as far as I'm aware, it will be safe to speak here. With that said, I'm Lanius. Yuri, Fiolla and Emily I already know."** He pauses to look at the remaining three men. "**You must be Kin,**" he says nodding to the Nautolan. **"Drem and Alarick,**" he finishes. "**Like I said we don't have much time. Jut-hakk has upped his time table and will be leaving within the next day. If you have any questions ask them quickly.**"

So Lanius did recognize him. While he didn´t really mind about that (it wasn´t like they had known each other well or anything), Yuri kind of hoped no one would start to question how Lanius would know him. And if they did, he hoped that Lanius would not raze any fake story that Yuri would put up. He was not in any way ashamed of his heritage as a Jedi, but he liked to have the advantage of information on his side, and thus be able to choose when he revealed such things to those he traveled with.
Nevertheless, he pulled down the hood of his poncho, and even managed a little smile. He didn´t really have any questions, though he still wasn´t exactly sure of how they would go about doing what they were going to do. But he guessed that information would follow in time.

"I have a question," said Kin as he stepped forward, "Where is this 'device' and how are we going to get it out of here without being filled with blaster holes?" The thought had crossed his mind as to why they were even on the station. Surely it would've been a better idea to just bombard it with a cruiser and leave no chance for the weapon to survive. *Probably has something to do with that damned Mandolorian.. They're always after new weapons*
Kin almost crossed his arms for a moment before deciding it still wasn't safe to take his hand off of his flechette launcher.

Drem had slid in and propped himself against the wall nearest to the door. He stood fairly quiet, examining Lanius and the Nagai carefully before speaking. Thinking about what Kin had asked, his mind wandered for a moment. *Hmm … what if this is a ploy from the Mandolorians? Or maybe there was something else on the station worth saving?* He figured he'd wait for the answer before jumping to too many conclusions. Following Kin's question, the scout piped up and asked, **"So who's 'Spooky'? I presume he's with us, since we're talking so freely in front of him. But I, for one, wouldn't mind something to go on."** Not the kind to just hand his safety to strangers, Drem's hand was never far from a weapon ...

**"*Spooky* goes by the name of Sajin, and is here because he knows something of the device that is our mission objective."**
The Nagai's grin is lopsided as he extends his hand and returns Ka'ra's greeting. As they proceed into the room Sajin had been using as his domicile, he deftly rifles through the flimsiplasts scattered on the table until he comes across a particular roll. He unrolls it slowly, and then anchors it with different odds and ends scattered on the tabletop.
**"As for *where* the device is, that we shall come to in a moment, but first I feel it is more important to address *what* this item is, that being the Force Harvester."**
Sajin pauses for a brief moment, glancing at each of the new individuals assembled around the table for any sign of recognition of the name, before he continues.
**"The Force Harvester is a particularly nasty bit of Sith Alchemy constructed by Exar Kun himself. It is aptly named for it harvests the essence of the Force from all living creatures within its range, and then harnesses the collected essence for use as a power source. Exar Kun used it to power the Dark Reaper, a starship built with incredible destructive capacity that was destroyed and scattered at the end of the first Sith War. What Jut-Hakk intends to do with it is unknown, and taken with the whole, irrelevant given the circumstances."**
He sets that document to the side and rustles another from the pile, holding it in place just as he did the last. This time it is a technical schematic of the station they were on, with hand drawn notes and diagrams at key tactical vantage points.
**"Now, to address your question,"** he says nodding to Kin, **"the where of the device is rather easy: It is towards the center of this facility on the level below us. Generally speaking, it is safeguarded by regular patrols of Jut-Hakk's best guardsmen and worked on by his top engineers, but Lanius has found a lag in their routine that we may exploit to our advantage."**
Sajin points to an access point on the schematic with written notes surrounding it detailing guard rotations, lunch schedules, and even suspected habitual waste relief breaks.
**"At the moment the Harvester's draining aura is dormant, but it is still extremely lethal to the touch and attempts to manipulate it through the Force will only be absorbed. Lanius has been gracious enough to offer to create a diversion for us during the rotation lag, making the *How* of the whole operation our responsibility: During the diversion we must infiltrate the lab, figure out a means to safely handle the Harvester, extract it without notice, and then make our escape."**
He then inhales a slow breath and exhales it just as slowly. Folding his arms over his chest after the last statement, the Nagai sounds like he's discussing how best to arrange a dinner party. Albeit a particularly *exciting* dinner party.
**"Are there any *more* questions?"**
Gazing around the table, Sajin quirks a raven-dark eyebrow and awaits the dissidence.

Emily hears the Nagai's comment about whether Lanius is sure of their compentence and smiles at the him when his gaze finally moves over to her, and even gives him a short wave, and then listens carefully while introductions are made and he goes over the information he has so far on the rest of their mission and looks over the schematics of the station looking for what she has used so many times, access tunnels that are too small for anyone else to use but that she can manage to squeeze through that might allow for her to get closer to the location of device then the access point indicated by Sajin.
She looks at Sajin and says, with a mischevious smile **"Moving the Harvester safely seems like it should be easy, it's not like we have to touch it with our naked hands to move it after all, that's what they invented tongs for."** then she seems to think for a moment before she asks, **"The guards around that part of the facility, are they wearing battle armour? In the same style as that we were transporting here? Because if they are that could be a perfect disguise."**

Lanius moves toward the table where Sajin has set up the floor plans for the level below. He indicates small dots as he continues near where the labs are located. "**The guards Jut-hakk has stationed in these corridors are specially trained. They have a high resistance to the Force and are fiercely loyal. They'll fight to the death to protect their charge.**" He looks at Emily and gives her a small smile. "**Retrieving the armor might very well work provided it could be smuggled out of storage without arousing suspicion. Depending on how quickly the deck crew has managed to unload the cargo, it may well be on their way to the armory.**"

Emily studies the map carefully, and says to Lanius and Saijn **"It looks like your schematics don't include the ventilation system. Is that an oversight with your mapping? Or do the actual schematics omit them as well?"**
She pauses as she looks around the map and says **"And where is the armoury? If the armour can't be retrieved from the docking bay perhaps we might be able to sneak some out of the armoury itself?"**

### **Alicia** (2010-06-27 05:50:54)

Reaching onto the table, Lanius retrieves a sheet of clear flimsiplast and laying it over, first matches the sections before securing it in place. The technical schemetics he overlaid now indicate where the power conduits and shafts lie, some of them large enough to allow a full grown man into indicating maintenance shafts. Smaller lines indicate only ventilation shafts. All but three of the five labs appears to have a closed ventilation system. Luckily, the Force is with the young girl, as a lab with an open system is the party's final destination. "**The armory has been set up two levels down from here. A temporary armory has been established next to the labs, however I don't know if they will be storing armor there. I do know some of those grenades Ka'ra had rig up will be sent there.**"

Emily traces the ventilation shaft which leads into the lab with a single finger and says, **"It looks like I'll be able to get in and out of the lab undetected at least."** and begins tracing the ventilation system to where she might be able to get into it, once she has a few possible entrances that aren't too heavily guarded she says, **"This seems like a pretty straight-forward job, I've done plenty of times, what kind of opposition should I expect in the lab?"** to Lanius and then looking at everyone else **"And do you think you can arrange some kind of diversion just in case I need to make some noise getting the device?"**

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Alicia** (2010-06-27 07:11:32)

"**There should only be a tech or two, none if we're lucky, but considering Jut-hakk has put the crunch on them it's doubtful**," Lanius starts, but then he is interrupted by a long buzz at the door. Something dark crosses his face before he turns towards Ka'ra. With a nod she heads towards the anteroom, closing the door firmly behind her.
In a lower tone which won't carry, he continues. "**A diversion will be no problem, especially with the grenades and what else I have planned. Provided the station follows protocols, the whole base will likely be evacuated in a matter of minutes. My only concern is how long we can keep Jut-hakk distracted. Once the power generators begin the overload sequence he will make a beeline to retrieve the Harvester.**" He pauses, listening to what is occurring in the outer room. "**That's why we needed you here.**" he says looking at Drem. "**Ka'ra and I can't do both at the same time.**"
Meanwhile in the anteroom:
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ka'ra opens the door, revealing the teenage boy beyond. Though perhaps boy wasn't such an apt a word since he had to be just as old as Ka'ra, his face not quite having lost the remnants of childhood. At his hip, Ka'ra spotted the presence of a lightsaber. "**What do you want?**" she asks brusquely, annoyance at the interruption flitting into her tone.
"**Ah, I was told you had come aboard. I've heard so much about you.**"
"**If this is a social call, you will have to come back.**" With one hand she moves to press the button which would close the door, but the young man stops her, reaching in to grab her arm at the wrist. After a failed attempt to shake him off she stares at him. Apparently she underestimated the strength of the man.
"**I've heard interesting stories about you.**"
"**You shouldn't listen to rumors, they always give you the wrong impressions.**" With a twist she frees her arm from the man's grip. "**Is there something you want? You're wasting my time.**"
The man grins at her and it makes Ka'ra shiver inside her armor. "These *rumors* claim you owe a life debt to Lanius."
"**Not that its any of your concern… Lanius happens to pay well and provides spectacular benefits.**"
"**Is that what women are calling it these days?**" he asks rhetorically, with a derisive laugh.
Her voice dark she says, "**If you have nothing important to say, goodbye.**" Not waiting for a response she reaches to close the door.
Again the man moves to grab her wrist, but this time she was ready for it. Bringing her other fist around she clenches it tightly sending sparks out and across his face as she hits it. He staggers backward, landing to lean against the wall across from the door. Calmly, she closes the door getting some satisfaction out of closing it in the bleeding man's face.

"Well while you're all sneaking around and making distractions, someone needs to make sure we have a way out," Kin didn't dislike the plan exactly but it did have holes that needed filling, "It would be fatal if we returned to the hangar only to find our ship surrounded by dark jedi or even worse stolen by some fleeing technician. And Jut-Hakk is going to be a problem, a problem easily solved by a few shots to the face but I'm guessing he could be problematic. If the diversion doesn't keep him distracted for long enough then someone will have to hold him off until we can get this 'weapon' out of here."

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Alicia** (2010-06-27 10:11:52)

Lanius gives Kin a nod, "**Securing the ship is a good idea, but with luck, you won't have to face Jut-hakk. Ka'ra and I will be occupying him while you get to the ship. If timed right, I can cause the overload as Emily nears the Harvester giving her the distraction she needs to get out of the lab unmolested. I'm afraid in the containment crate it's too large to push through the vents. It will still be up to all of you to get it to the ship.**"

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-27 11:04:16)

**"Do we know anything about personnel supposed to be in the hangar? I can probably get in there simple enough, but I don´t want to be running into a full garrison. With the number of guard posts outside though, it could be guessed the hangar won´t hold too much security. Once inside, I could probably seize the ship and then crate some commotion to draw at least a few people out of those corridors to give you guys an easier path"**

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Sketchpad** (2010-06-27 13:20:06)

Taking all this in, Drem pondered the map for a bit and listened to Kin and Yuri talk about the ship, which sparked an idea. **"Is there any other exits that a ship could access?"** He asked, his eyes narrowing a bit as he looked at the area closer.  **"Wait … what if we just blew out a wall and scooped it up into the transport? I know it seems crazy, but I don't think they'd expect it … have a small team go in, lock down the area and secure the Harvester before blowing an exterior wall. The decompression would blow everyone into space … or into the ship that I could squeeze over. I would just need some help steering and directing folks."** Thinking on it for another second, Drem scratched the scruff of his chin.  **"Hmm … I'll need some cable launchers … I think we have a vac-suit on the ship … if not, may need one of those … maybe a magnetic anchor to drag the Harvester on board. We'd have to act fast, as I'm sure there's an emergency system built in that'll shut the wall off."** Looking up, he asked around the room, **"Everyone has had Emergency Zero-G training, right?"**

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-27 19:35:47)

Yuri raised an eyebrow as he looked at Drem. Clearly, the man had a good deal of imagination, to say the least.
**"I like the sound of blowing up a wall to get away, but I´m not too keen on doing it until we are all inside the ship. By the way, does the ship have any kind of anti-personnel emplacements? If so, then securing the ship could ease any combats remarkably"**

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Anazider** (2010-06-28 00:17:29)

Sajin shakes his head at the pilot, point at several places on the map detailing the area surrounding the station.
**"No… The lab we want does not share an exterior wall, it is towards the center of this station. Likewise, we're embedded in a somewhat dense asteroid, so unless you are packing a considerable amount of firepower, or have a great deal more time than we do, you would not be able to punch through to the lab in an appreciable amount of time." (Knowledge: Tactics +8 + roll of 20 = 28 for check)**
He then quirks an eyebrow at Emily and points at where the ventilation shaft is located in relation to the floor. An amused smile plays at the corner of his lips, and softens his words.
**"And unless you have the ability to jump like a Kowakian Monkey-Lizard, then you will need assistance just getting *into* the ventilation duct. Fortunately, I have climbing equipment and a bit more height than you, both of which should prove useful here."**
When Kin and Yuri offer their respective ideas, he shakes his head while folding his arms across his chest.**"The guardsmen are mostly displaced soldiers from the war and a handful of well-trained mercenaries, but each has an unfailing belief in Jut-Hakk. And make no mistakes: None of us here are the most powerful being on this station. That title distinctly belongs to Jut-Hakk. If the success of this mission depends on fending off his retaliation, then we have greatly failed somewhere."**
Whatever levity he had afforded when speaking to Emily is gone now, replaced with a laser-honed focus. The Nagai takes up several marking tokens, arranging them strategically at points of interest.
**"This is what I propose: Myself, the girl, and you,"** he says with a nod to Fiolla, **"Will infiltrate the lab and secure the Harvester and begin its extraction. Since the rest of you have voiced some desire to either secure the hangar or some means of our escape, then that is what you will do. It is imperative that you hold that ground, as it will be our only lifeline off of this rock, and that will include keeping the blast doors open until we arrive and then the hangar bay doors until we have egressed. If you have commlinks with a secured channel, we may remain in communication as applicable. In, out, and away with no causalities and as little fanfare as can be mustered." (Knowledge: Tactics +8 + roll of 20 = 28 for check)**
Sajin then folds his arms back over his chest once again while staring at the map for any minute details.
**"I believe it to be a sound plan, but I am open to other ideas. As well, speak up if you believe your talents would be better utilized in either team, but I would like to keep things balanced. I only hazard that any further dissension is time spent that we will not recover, so I advise precision and haste. If there are no objections, then I suggest we best be about this and begin to proceed accordingly."**

### **Tempeste** (2010-06-28 03:31:25)

"I agree with most of the plan but you need at least four to get the harvester," Kin stepped a little closer to the map, "It'll take two of you to carry it and if you get caught unawares it's likely you'd go down before you could even get your weapons drawn. I'll come with you three and the others should both make sure the ship is prepped for launch and make sure there aren't any guards to greet us." The concept of someone being all too powerful to kill was odd to Kin, he'd served with Jedi before and whilst they were tough, a snipers shot to the head seemed to kill them pretty well. They're still organic, if something's organic it can be killed was one of Kin's personal mottos.
"I feel you fear Jut-Hakk too much, he's only one man and there our nine of us. Sounds like the odds are in our favour no?"

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-28 07:11:29)

*Wow…suddenly it sounds like it was all his ideas…*
Looking disoriented for a moment, Yuri blinked his eyes and looked at Sajin.
**"Sorry, I had a flash of deja vu…thought I´d heard that plan before. But if I may, I agree with our rubber-skinned friend here. You seem quite scared of both Jut-Hakk and his men. I´d say we have a few people on our side who also fought in the wars, putting us at least even with those soldiers. As for Jut-Hakk…we´ll just have to avoid it coming to that, but if it does, we´ll just handle it. Unless you know something spectacular about him that we don´t. If so, now would be a good time to tell us"**
With the last sentences, Yuri shifted his gaze to Ka'ra and shot her a glance saying something like "that goes for you too".

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Darren** (2010-06-28 09:06:23)

Emily looks at the Saijn as she considers his plan and says, **"So lets see if I've got my part in the plan clear. Basically you are going to help me get into the ventilation system, then I will enter the lab secure the Harvester and open the door for you and Fiolla after you have managed to get around the guards outside, if they aren't drawn away by the diversionary explosion?"**
She looks at Yuri while she waits for a reply kind of agreeing with him that there is a lot of attention being paid to how dangerous this Juk-Hakk even though if everything goes smoothly he won't even really have a chance to do much before they are already heading out of the system.

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Alicia** (2010-06-28 10:24:58)

Ka'ra, having been in the anteroom answering the door, returned at some point during Sajin's dissertation. Having left Sajin to handle any further plans, Lanius goes to speak to Ka'ra quietly by the door. Quietly she recounts what had occurred at the door.
"**You did what?!**" he asks, his voice raising.
"**I knocked the sheb on his ass.**" She glances at the others her tone still the same, hoping Lanius's small outburst hadn't ruined the meeting.
"**Do you have any idea who that was?**"
Ka'ra shrugs. "**Some upstart wannabe Jedi with the wrong attitude.**" Is all she says on the matter as she walks away to rejoin the meeting. Lanius continues to stand by the door, rubbing the bridge of his nose, obviously thinking. Catching the last of Sajin's plan of action she listens at the ensuing questions and denials. When Yuri directs his gaze on her, expecting some sort of answer, she glances at Lanius, who had left quietly into the anteroom.
She sighs and turns her attention back to Yuri and then the party as a whole. "**Lanius once mentioned that Jut-hakk's power and ability would rival that of the greatest Jedi in the Order. He's an aggressive fighter and even more so when he's determined. Though I've never see him fight myself, I have met him and I can attest to how strong a presence he presents.**" She pauses crossing her arms. "**He wouldn't have gotten this far if he didn't have the power to back it up. If you come across him, I would go in the other direction and hope he didn't see you. Especially if you've managed to collect the Harvester. He'll be drawn to it like a fly to uj'alayi.**"

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Sketchpad** (2010-06-28 17:19:16)

Drem shrugged off most of Sajin's comments on his plan. **"Either way, I think it'd make more sense if I helped secure the ship. If I'm seen as the ship's pilot, it shouldn't seem too unusual for me to head back to it. At least this way, I can fire her up and get the prep ready…"** Drem stopped a bit short before talking again. **"Might be a good idea to check the inventory as well to make sure that the ship's been refueled and all. Otherwise, we're going to have one grist of a short trip."** Looking to Sajin, he asked, **"Okay, *Spookie*, so what about a back-up plan? How much time are we looking at before retrieval? No offense, folks, but I didn't sign on for no suicide mission, and I'd prefer if we all got out in one piece."**

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Tempeste** (2010-06-28 17:29:05)

"Heh, A suicide mission isn't as bad as it sounds. Everybody gives you a glass of whiskey for good luck and nobody can resist a man who's ready to sacrifice himself for others," Kin remarked quickly, "Of course then people are expecting you to die and it gets embarrasing when you come back alive, especially if your 'friends' have already divided your belongings amongst themselves.."
*Now where was I.. Can't lose focus now..*
Kin turned to face Ka'ra, "Ok I get it, the mission isn't to kill Jutt-Hakk. You should know I have a habit for achieveing the impossible though. If he's as tough as you make him out to be I hope you've got something special planned."

---

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-28 18:25:11)

**"I agree, I don´t do suicide missions. Though I really don´t see why we have to worry so much about Jut-Hakk, especially *after* we get our hands on the Harvester. If the information you have about this thing is correct, we shouldn´t have to worry too much. If I were Jut-Hakk, I´d think twice before messing with someone who had an artifact that could suck all my special powers out of me. Or, for that matter, someone could potentially destroy said artifact, thus preventing me from ever using it again"**
In the back of his head, Yuri focused his mind, and reached out into the Force.
*Master, you were there aboard the Star Forge. It too was an artifact of darkness, wasn´t it? What could happen if we destroy the Harvester?*

Fiolla had been quietly listening to the rest, simply nodding from time to time to indicate whether she agreed or didn't. She wasn't much of a planner, her master had been the one to handle that back when she was still a Padawan and after that there wasn't really much to plan for, when living from day to day. Finally she gives her own few credits.
"I don't mind that we split up. Though the question is whether the teams are right or not. I can take care of injuries and since all of the more heavily armed members are in one group, it appears that the risk of injuries are greater there." she says in a way that makes her appear a bit timid.
Then she looks over at Kin, shaking her head slightly.
"I think it means that there is a run-on-sight order if we encounter Jutt-Hakk. Not that you should take stupid chances that gets yourself killed, thereby weakening the team."

### **Anazider** (2010-06-29 23:52:10)

**"Our window will be 10 minutes."** He says by way of an answer to Emily's question and with a nod.
**"The moment that the primary generators reach critical mass, the emergency power supplies will kick in but will only be capable of maintaining bare-bones systems: life support, running lights, hazard shielding and the like. Most of the doors will go to manual access mode, slowing pursuit, and it will take at least that much time for engineering to begin power regulation controls. We dally any more than that and it will be pure improvisation and teamwork, the escalated timeline has left little room for a plan B."** The Nagaian chuckles while shaking his head at some inner amusement.
**"Then once we have the Harvester loaded we depart in your vessel with all due haste, make several non-correlational microjumps and then go to ground until we can offload the device at a safehouse."**
Sajin then listens to Kin and Yuri's rebuttals with as deadpan an expression as has ever been seen. And considering his ghostly pallor, that is pretty deadpan.
**"Destroying the Harvester here may create a singularity in space, some horrific backlash through the Force, or nothing more than a spectacular light show. We do not know. What we do know is that it took all that the Jedi Council of old could do to disassemble it, and the cost in lives to hide it until Jut-Hakk found it, has been considerable. Likewise, it would prove a poor gambit to try and desperately fumble with a dormant device that could take the lives of everyone onboard this station when the one that is most knowledgeable in its use is on the other end."** Exhaling a patient breath, the Nagai rubs at the bridge of his nose.
**"But I am glad we have seasoned war veterans amongst us. Ones who know the value of achieving the objective with as few unnecessary complications as possible. Especially ones that know it isn't greater numbers or overwhelming force that wins the day, but the best utilization of force focused at the point of attack. And so very gracious to realize when all are contributing, and it does not matter from whence wisdom comes, so long as it is wise. Very glad indeed."** Sajin sighs again and then suddenly claps his hands before himself, rubbing his hands together as if in anticipation.
**"So! It sounds as if we've a grumbling quorum, but a quorum nonetheless. I concede your point Fiolla, and so that would make the infiltration team Emily, the Nautolan, and myself while everyone else secures the shuttle and hangar. As no plan survives its initial encounter, this whole situation will be very fluid. The Force willing, *will* prevail."**
With that, Sajin moves off to a corner of the room to recover a rucksack and utility belt loaded with various bits of equipment. He quickly doffs his jacket and undershirt in favor of a darker, more form-fitting jerkin. Lastly, he hangs a visor from his neck and then stands with his hands on his hips, watching.

*Cryptic as always, eh? I´m so glad you keep tutoring me even after your death…*
Returning his mind to a more present place, Yuri blinks once to refocus himself. Nevertheless, it seemed a bad idea to destroy the Harvester, just like he had thought, but that didn´t change anything.
**"And how would Jut-Hakk know we don´t have the skills to use it? Or that we aren´t prepared to destroy it in order to keep him from getting it? If someone can tell a convincing lie, we could probably stall him, at least for a short while, if necessary"**

Emily takes a visor of her own, and puts it on her forehead and pushes it back holding her hair of of the way like a headband. She watches as Sajin with a slightly amused expression and when he is finished she says, **"I'm ready whenever you are, and the sooner we get started the less likely they are to work out who we are before we've infiltrated the lab."**
And heads over to the door opening it and heading out into the corridor not bothering to wait for him or the Nautolan to indicate they are ready, just expecting them to follow.

Alarick looked around and shrugged his shoulders. No one had said a word to him and at this point he really didn't care. He had better thing to do than to babysit and play delivery boy. He turned to head out of the room and as he started to say something he thought for a moment and figured no one really cared. As he walked past Emily he smiled and simply patted her on the head and pulled out a cigar before lighting it. Walked back towards the ship he pulled his sleeve back up and started taking notes, completely forgetting that he still had the detonators and the switch for his home made acid bomb.

Ka'ra gives a short laugh at Emily's brusque departure from the meeting, declaring herself roaring to go. "**Mandokarla bal'ban**," she says pleased and amused at the same time.
Lanius passes Emily and the departing Alarick into the room. Glancing at everyone he says, "**I hope you have your plan in order…**" Then looking at Ka'ra he adds, "**We've been summoned.** Ka'ra only provides a nod to the statement, growing quiet and heads toward the door. Stopping to lay a supportive hand on Emily's shoulder in place of a smile. "**I'll see you soon, ad'ika,**" she says with only a trace of doubt.
Lanius continues to address those remaining in the quarters, "**Signal Ka'ra over comms when you are ready for the distraction**." He provides you with Ka'ra's commlink frequency. "**Force be with you,**" he says, before turning to follow Ka'ra out and they proceed down the corridor in the opposite direction of the lifts.

After Ka'ra and Lanius leave, Drem scratches the scruff on his chin and says, **"Okay … so now what? I agree that I'd be of better use at the ship, especially if we might need a quick getaway. Is there anything that the 'Ship Team' should be doing besides sitting on your thumbs like a pair of tamed gundarks?"** He checked over his carbine, looking to Sajin for the inevitable answer he knew would come from the Nagai. Deep down, he knew that it could be a sound plan, but Drem was hesitant to trust the newcomer, especially since his presence wasn't in the plans that Ka'ra had mentioned ...

**"Secure the hangar, and keep it secure. If we encounter too much resistance, we will call you in for support, or to join us in blaster-related perforation, whichever occurs first. Either way, I believe you will find yourself rather occupied."**
Sajin shakes his head at Drem and then chuckles at his own dark humor. He watches as the young girl sprites her way out of the door and then turns as Lanius and Ka'ra also depart, calling after the armored warrior.
**"We will maintain comm silence with you, unless necessity dictates. One comm click for the distraction, two for when we've recovered the package. May the Force be with you as well."**
And with that, the Nagai kicks his pack up from the ground and hitches it over a shoulder. Sajin spares one last glance for those gathered in the sparsely decorated room and then he lopes after Emily, not wanting the child to get too far ahead lest she find herself in trouble.

Emily is occasionally casting glances over her shoulder as she heads down the corridor toward the entry point she had picked out, and notices when Sajin comes out after her to make sure she doesn't get too far ahead but she doesn't slow her pace to make it easier for him to catch up, sure that his longer legs will make up the distance in short order anyway.
Once he catches up to her she will smile mischievously and say, **"I'm glad you could make it. It would be a lot harder to get into the vent system without some help. Do you have any preferences for how I secure the lab?"**

Yuri watches people leave the room, and waits for them to be on their way a bit before standing up from his position of leaning on the wall and looked over the people left in the room.
**"Anyone else getting sick of that guys "I know best so do as I say" attitude?"**
He looks over at Drem and Fiolla.
**"I guess it´s up to us to get that ship ready to leave then. Well technically us and Slick, but he doesn´t seem very interested in anything. Just hope he doesn´t get himself killed somewhere.

Fiolla watches the others leave, wondering exactly what she's supposed to do, which then seems to be cleared when Yuri speaks to her. She turns her head in his direction, considering the situation for a few seconds, before she gives a reply.
"I must admit that I have only little knowledge about how to move unseen. Usually I rely on my connection to the Force, but if the crew here are specially trained to resist the mind tricks of Jedi, I don't have any ideas. The most obvious would perhaps to cause a major distraction in one area, so that most of the guards are drawn there, then we will move swiftly into our area. And at the same time it might aid those picking up the weapon too?"

**"Hmm, that sounds like a good idea, though where exactly to create the distraction could be a problem. If something is stirred up outside the hangar, it might attract so many guards it becomes impossible for us to get in"**
Yuri rubs his cheek for a moment.
**"I suppose I could try to get myself into the hangar unseen, and create some sort of commotion inside. Once the guards closest to the hangar is distracted, you can follow and jump them from behind. Then we can try to lock the door to keep more guards from coming in while we secure the inside and wait for our allies to do their thing"**
He wrinkled his forehead a bit as he realized an obvious complication with his plan.
**"Of course, they might find it quite difficult to get inside if an army of guards is waiting outside the hangar, trying to breach the door"**

Ka'ra gestures to Sajin in a small wave that she heard him as she leaves the room to have her last words with Emily. Now they are gone, having left down the hallway opposite of the one to the lift which will take you back to the hanger bay and to the labs.
Kin follows behind Sajin as he leaves to catch up with Emily and does so right as she reaches the lift. The others aren't far behind as Yuri, Drem and Fiolla join them to head back to the hanger. Once everyone piles into the lift, it's a short ride back to the lower level you arrived at.
Those heading back to the ship are unmolested by the guards stationed through out the hallways, though you see one of the stations of the two you had passed has moved from its previous spot, that or the guard change has occurred and the new batch hasn't arrived. The two guards outside the glance over the three of you, but allow you to pass back into the hanger. The bay itself is almost just as you left it. Crates have been moved, but others seem to have taken their place as the hauler droids continue their work. There's a large amount of crates sitting outside the open cargo ramp of the transport you arrived on. But from your walk through the transport's cargo hold, this seems to be only half of what was being carried. As you arrive, a hauler comes by and loads a palette of foodstuffs, before hauling it off toward one of the cargo lifts in the bay. Walking onto the transport, you realize you're missing a member of the party. Alarick is nowhere to be found.
------------------------------------------------------------
The entrance to the vent shaft Emily picked out is located just outside the maintenance bay door down the hall from where the labs are located. As you bid goodbye to your fellows at the turbolift, you head in the opposite direction of the hanger down the wide corridors. You pass by another guard station unmolested as you finally reach the designated hallway. You find there's a slight problem as two techs loiter outside the door to the maintenance bay, in full view of the vent.

(This is a representation of the main level meant to show you relative scale and locations. It is by no means completely accurate. For example, there are 5 labs, and the bay and size of ships would most likely be larger.)

Sajin eyes the pair of technicians with a smile. He sidles up to the corner furthest away from the idling techs while maintaining line of sight, turning to Kin and Emily and speaking in a hush as if about some private matter. The half-smile never fades, for the benefit of the two watching.
**"Once the distraction is engaged, those two should run off, leaving us with our access route. I can make the initial climb up to secure an anchor line, then I suggest it be Emily in first, myself, and then Kin guarding the rear. I hope the others are in position. Thoughts?"**
The Nagai's eyes half-lid as he speaks, a tingling awareness flooding his being and suffusing his thoughts. He asks himself one simple question, seeking an answer through some greater intuition:
***Is now the best time to signal the distraction?***

"I'm not going through that vent, I'll come in through the door once you've scouted out the inside and opened it from in there," he replied quietly while examining the two technicians, trying to discern whether they were armed or not. " He had his flechette launcher gripped and ready to fire now, his finger near the trigger but not on it.
"Oh, Next time we're on an important mission that needs brilliant co-ordination and secrecy, I suggest those idiots in logistics get us some comm-links. I don't think I can shout loud enough for them to hear us, I say get the distraction going now."
This mission was about to either go well or fall to pieces, Kin made sure he was prepared for either situation and glanced down the hall behind them one last time.

Emily shakes her head and says, **"I think that about covers anything.

**"We´re in the middle of a bunch of Force users with questionable morality, and led by a man in possession of some really nasty piece of Sith sorcery. I´d be worried if you didn´t have a bad feeling"**
Yuri smiles a bit as he too takes a look around. His primary goal is not to locate Alarick though - he figures the man can take care of himself - but instead to get a survey of the interior of the hangar. He has no delusions that "securing the ship" will not include some fighting, and he is pretty sure that any guards in the facility will not hesitate to use lethal force against them.
At the very least he feels they need to know the number of personnel that can be arrayed against them. He tried to count to number of guards they passed on the way to the hangar, and as he looks around he tries to add that number to any personnel present in the hangar. In addition, he looks for anything in particular they might need to watch out for, such as a manned and rigged blaster cannon, or a dark jedi walking around.

Sajin quirks an eyebrow at Kin and then uses his tongue to switch the frequencey of his hands-free commlink to the secure channel, then depressed it once to signal the need for the distraction. The moment after he does so, he expands his senses outwards to gain a tacitcal lay of the area, using his training as a Shadow in an attempt to conceal his use of the Force.
**"Stand ready. We can feint as if we are leaving with the technicians once the surprise is set, and then drift back to the vent to begin infiltration. You will be alone at the door for a time, Nautolan, until we have fully gained access, so I hope you are prepared. May the Force see us through."**
He speaks in the same friendly whisper, and nods as if one of his companions had said something particularly enjoyable. All the while, the Nagai was entering a cold state of clarity, mentally coiling himself like a viper against the task that lay ahead.

Fiolla found a crate and sat down on it, once she was inside the cargo hold of their own ship. She leaned back slightly, didn't say a word, but simply waited. She didn't pay much attention to the missing crew member, figuring that if he got himself into trouble it was his own fault, not her responsibility. With those final thoughts she began slipping into a meditative trance, in order to get some rest, so she would be completely ready when/if all hell suddenly breaks loose.

**Outside the Maintenance room** (Kin, Sajin and Emily)
The effects of the distraction aren't immediate. The first indication something is wrong is when both of the loitering techs are paged via their commlinks. They look at each other and both seem to grow pale. With a great deal of haste they head into the maintenance bay where they will have direct access to the engineering section of the station. There's no other living soul in sight of the designated vent as the door to the bay closes. The ceiling, which is four meters from the ground, is angled at the edges. The vent is located in this slope, roughly 3 and a half meters from the ground.
**In the hanger bay** (Yuri, Fiolla and Drem)
With Alarick no where in sight and with no real inkling of when the distraction will be set into play, the three of you are left to your own devices in your part of the plan to secure the bay. As tech begin to bustle about in a far more coordinated manner than they had previously. The techs working on the freighter move away from it hurriedly into the hall leading into the rest of the base. Some head to the lifts as they begin to lower down into what you assume is a storage hanger. One of the techs heads to the bottom of your ramp and calls up, "**Be prepared to take on passengers if an evacuation order comes down.**" It isn't long before he departs to attend his duties.

Sajin nods to his cohorts to signal the beginning of the next phase. A gloved hand strays to the small of his back to recover a silver cylinder capped by a concave metal disk, at the center of which is a darkened button. The Nagaian thumbs the button and a pale white blade coalesces into form, bathing the other two in its glow.
Taking a few steps back, Sajin then runs full sprint directly at the wall just beneath the targeted vent, and improbably continues his run almost completely perpendicular to the surface just until he's beneath the vent. He then leaps out with a twist, turning to both simultaneously slash at the grating covering the vent with the lightsaber and clutch at the opening with his freehand as he goes by.

**Hanger Bay**
The techs in the hanger bay are busy preparing for the potential evacuation, evident as a couple of the stored shuttles, similar to the one you arrived in, rises from the level below into the bay via the landing pad lifts. Lowering the ramps to the shuttles, they prepare them for immediate takeoff. Hauler droids speed along the bay, transporting essential and expensive goods onto the shuttles.
A couple senior techs, including the chief, stand out as the go about directing and overseeing the bay's evacuation.
---------------------------------
**Outside the maintenance bay**
Sajin's lightsaber activates with the usual thrum, which in such close proximity seems to echo through the hallway. In what seems a simple maneaver Sajin defies gravity itself as he scales the wall toward the grate, swinging his saber to cut the necessary hole. With an exceptional feat of his athleticism he is able to grab the ledge of the duct though he has to fight back the sudden surge of pain from the cooling metal.

It took Yuri a moment to realize what Drem meant, but when he did, a couple of things clicked in place. And somewhere in the back of his mind echoed words from his padawan training, telling him to be more aware of the present. He gave a slight nod to Drem, but kept walking towards the ramp.

"Besides we can't take off before the boss-man gets back, otherwise he'll be dealing out his own form for justice. Which is very painful."
She pauses for just a second, before she continue. "Do you think we should find 'rick? Before he gets himself into more trouble than he can handle? I don't really know him well enough to know that he doesn't bring trouble upon us."

Sajin deactivates his lightsaber and then swings himself up into the now-open vent, ignoring the throbbing in his hand. Once he's in a stable position, he activates the dispenser on his utility belt and begins feeding a line of liquid cable down to Emily on the ground below, all the while maintaining a vigil on the hallway for any sign of complication.

Kin watched Sajin's flashy display of the force with some disdain, he simply shook his head and turned away. The Lab was his destination, walking down the corridors he kept his weapon at the ready but tried to be a bit more subtle about it, and his eyes were constantly scanning in front and behind him, trying to make sure he didn't catch the attention of any guards. Part of him hoped no one noticed the armed Nautolan heading towards the deadly force technology whilst another part of him almost wished that they did.
Kin stopped for a moment when he though he heard footsteps behind him, he glanced back and saw nothing that wasn't already there and blinked quickly.
*Still nothing..*
He shook his head and carried on moving towards the objective, always ready for anything unexpected.

Walking down the ramp, Yuri looks around, to try and see if there are any people heading their way. And well, just in general take a look around to see what appears to be happening in the hangar.

Emily eyes widen in surprised when Sajin takes out a lightsaber, and widen even further when he runs straight up the wall to slice through the vent, as his hand moves to grab a hold she winces realising that the surface would no doubt be hot after being exposed to the kind of heat required to cut the vent and is impressed that he doesn't show the pain or lose his grip before heading inside the vent.
When he lets down the cable she is a little distracted trying to fit what he managed to do into what she believed was possible as she has never seen anyone use the force before, she isn't distracted for too long though only a second or so before she notices the cable and begins to climb up it toward the vent shaft.
Once she gets into the vent with Sajin she will say to him, "You've got quite a few tricks up your sleeve don't you?"

Through out the station the lights dim and red emergency lights replace them in the luminescent fullness. A mechanized voice booms over the loudspeaker. "**Attention, this is not a drill. Proceed to the nearest evacuation point. Ten minutes till critical overload.**" The message repeats two more times, and then grows quiet. After a few minutes it proceeds to repeat the message all over again, but adjusts for the time remaining.
============================================================
**The vents** (Emily and Sajin)
With Sajin's help Emily is quickly pulled up into the vent. The young girl holds on desperately as the Jedi brings her closer and closer to the vent. After a bit of maneuvering both are able to fit into the vent, though for certain the opening Emily had picked is going to be a tight fit for the older man's broad shoulders. There's a loud rumble emanating from within the vents and you can only assume the sound isn't from circulation fans. Even though the trek is slow going with Sajin managing to get himself stuck a couple times the two finally arrive where the schematics indicate the lab should be. The rumble around them has only grown louder during the trek, but now their attention is drawn in through the slates of the grate where they can see a red field emanates through out the dark room. In the darkness nothing else can be discerned through the slates of the grate.
============================================================
**Hallway** (Kin)
The guards on duty have slimmed down, most apparently having abandoned their post. The only guards in sight are standing at attention outside one of the labs. The doors to said lab opens and a human man and woman dressed in the smocks of the stations scientist exits. "**Are you sure we shouldn't take it with us? Lord Jut-hakk would be quite displeased if something happened to it.**" the woman asks the man as he turns to swipe a card through a reader at the door. Lights on the panel turn from green to red.
"**He explicitly said not to move it under any condition. Besides I think he'll be quite pleased with the information we found**." He says patting one of his pockets. "**Possibly what he needed to replicate the technology.**" The two of them are nearby now, having left the door into the lab and the guards behind. They walk quickly neither of them wanting to get caught on the station when the overload occurs.
============================================================
**Hanger Bay** (Fiolla, Drem and Yuri)
The deck crew continues working in prepping the ships in as orderly manner as they can considering they only have a limited frame of time to get off the station themselves. Cargo haulers have also begun boarding your ship placing palettes of goods in the cargo hold. From the far side of the bay a makeshift lift lowers to the level below out of sight.

Sajin looms over the grate, his eyes flicking from left to right as he peers through the slats for any sign of the lab's occupants.
Seeing none, he inverts his lightsaber over the grating as he prepares to slice through it. Before he does, the Nagaian motions to Emily to give him as much room as could be afforded in the cramped confines, then Sajin takes a deep breath and expands his senses outwards.
If he finds the room devoid of life, he ignites the saber and cuts a portal into the room for them both.

Kin watched as the two scientists came into view and kept his eyes and ears on them as they walked past. He was supposed to be making sure the others had a route out but this would all be for nought if Jut Hakk could just replicate the device anyway. The nautolan followed the two scientists until they were out of sight of the guards and then approched them.
"Excuse me," he said whilst raising his hands and moving in front of them, "I have orders to secure any senstive information before evacuation, to be delivered to Jutt Hakk himself." Kin dropped the seemingly feared name in a hope them less likely to want to disbelieve him. "If you could hand anything over then It would be the best for all of us."
Kin wasn't exactly known for his bluffing skills but he'd rather try that first instead of gunning down two scientists in cold blood. He'd resort to that if necessary, they had a single chance.

Seeing the goods loaded onto the ship, Drem wanders over and takes a look at them. **"Hmm … what've we got here?"** He thought out loud. Examining the cargo, he was curious what they were loading and had an idea. *Wait a minute,* he pondered, *I bet we could walk right out with the device …* The scout wandered down the gangplank and looked around the docking bay, looking at the size of the ships in comparison to their shuttle. Looking to the elevator, he scratched his chin and narrowed his eyes as he made some calculations in his head ...
Drem's looking to see if their shuttle's one of the larger, if not largest, ship that's in the bay. Are they the same kind of shuttles? And how big is the elevator?

As the cargo haulers start loading their ship, the young Jedi shuts her mouth and shrugs, seemingly her random comments having no response and thus there would be no need for them to reason why they couldn't take on any other passengers than those already planned. She looks over the various sorts of cargo brought aboard, after which she figures that she should probably help them, so they didn't cover anything important and so that they optimized the amount that was brought aboard.
"No, I think that box would fit better over there," Fiolla states to one of the cargo haulers, trying to interrupt those who probably got far more experience with this sort of stuff than her, but at least then she'd feel useful, and the little Sith Lord sitting on her shoulder, who rarely wins any arguments with the Jedi Master on the other, was telling her about how all the cargo might be sold after this and how she could perhaps get part of the profits...

While the room is empty of all occupants, Sajin quickly discovers as he jumps down from the vent that it's not devoid of any security measures. From the ceiling two small blaster turrets come to life, targeting the Nagaian Jedi. With a whir they swing around and without any hesitation fire a shot at Sajin. As Emily is still in the vent, they have yet to notice the young girl.
Now in the room, Sajin can see the dimly glowing orb of the Force Harvester hovering within a containment field above a worktable in the center.

The scientists had turned into the hallway heading toward either the lifts or the hanger bay. Thanks to the evacuation clearly underway, the hallway is clear of any guards. The two scientist look at Kin confused for a moment and then at each other.
"**Lord Jut-hakk has always insisted on being brought our findings directly**," the man says.
"I**'ve never seen you here before… are you new?**" The other asks.
As the evacuation warning sounds again (six minutes) they both look at each other nervous. "**If you would direct us to his shuttle, we would be happy to present it to him ourselves.**" The woman nods in agreement to her fellow scientist's compromise.
==========================================
**Hanger** (Fiolla, Drem and Yuri)
The hauler droids bring aboard palettes of construction materials and assorted medical equipment in addition to the palettes which had been waiting at the bottom of the ramp. The grenades and the barrels of the corrosive substances Alarick had rigged have already been unloaded and had yet to make a reappearance back in the shuttle's hold. The droids ignore or rather aren't programmed to respond to vocal commands as the go about their task regardless of the organization Fiolla attempts to impose on their work.
As Drem watches the lift, it slowly begins to rise with at least two squads of troopers on board standing in a tight formation. A nearby deck hand motion for them to proceed to the closest shuttle, which, thankfully, is not yours. Once the troops have marched orderly, yet quickly off the lift, it descends once more.

"New.. You could say that. Jutt Hakk felt he needed to hire some extra security, mercenaries with experience." Kin motioned towards the Hangar bay, pointing towards it with his hand, "I want you to follow me and to not stop for anything. If your research is delayed or lost then you'll both have your necks on the line. You understand?"
With that said Kin began to lead them back to their own shuttle at a brisk pace, hoping to get there and back in time to ensure the Harvester could be extracted. He planned to lead them onto the shuttle and then detain them there, after getting the information of course. It would always be useful to have two of the scientists working on the thing, for interrogation and other purposes.

Yuri watches somewhat troubled as a mass of soldiers walks of the lift and into a nearby shuttle. The situation had looked quite manageable before, though the insertion of several guys with weapons who looked like they could use them would definitely complicate things.
He took a quick look around, looking for people headed for their shuttle. The loading droids he could stand, but he´d try to keep anyone else that he didn´t know off the shuttle. He especially didn´t want another unit of soldiers to get on board. In an almost carefree motion, he slipped one of the R-9 canisters from his belt into his hand and started playing with it loosely.

Sajin has only a split second to curse his ineptitude before the blaster turrets are trained on him, and unleashing their lethal payload. It's all the Nagai can do to throw himself out of the way at the last moment, earning a blaster scorch down his back and a bruised shoulder for the effort.
**"Get to cover, I will draw their fire!"**
The Jedi's order comes out in a clenched-jaw growl, but then he's off, the ghostly-white blade leaving a hazy after image as Sajin sprints to the side, and then directly at one of the turret's. He leaps into the air with a hiss of expelled breath, hurtling through the air end-over-end in a somersault before lashing out at the turret with his lightsaber, attempting to disable the offending blaster for good.

**Vents / Lab** (Emily and Sajin)
The turrets keeping a bead on Sajin as he charges the turret to the right both take shots on him. Unable to adjust as quickly the closest turret's shot misses Sajin just as he springs up into the air. The other turret manages to adjust accordingly and hits Sajin right as he cleaves its counterpart in half. Sajin lands in a kneeling position, sparks arching above his head.
Emily out of the way of the turrets line of fire, decides to stay where she is. Drawing her own blaster pistol she makes a shot off at the other turret. Having only the light from its last shot to pinpoint its location she manages only to hit the cieling next to it.

The scientists follow Kin readily enough, cowed by his aggresive authority. So much so they don't question him when he passes by one shuttle and heads toward the shuttle he had arrived. Upon reaching the shuttle, the again look at each other and then at Yuri and Drem standing outside. "**Are you sure this is his shuttle**?" the woman asks Kin.
The droids continue to bring in the crates, unhampered by any interruptions by the others. The lift Drem is watching has completly dissapeared as it completes its decent to the level below in preperation of retrieving more troops.

Yuri smiles and looks at Drem.
**"What? You in the market for new ships? I think we have enough for now. Though I have to say I agree with you on th situation, we´re at bad odds. If worse come to worse before we are ready to leave, I think those will be our most dangerous spots"**
He discreetly pointed towards the weapon emplacements he had spotted before. They were not rigged yet, but if a fight broke out, they would have to act quickly to make sure they never were. As he sensed a group of people approaching, he turned around and was surprised to see Kin along with a few unknown people. As he realized they were seemingly intent on boarding the shuttle, he started moving in their direction.
**"And whose shuttle would that be, miss? I have a very specific list of persons allowed aboard this shuttle, and I don´t recall seeing you or your entourage on it"**

Paying attention to where Yuri had noted, Drem took a quick look at the emplacements. **"I don't know if I call it a 'new ship',"** he replied, **"More like keeping my options open. It's that lift that's giving me the most …"** The scout quickly shut up as the Kin and his "new friends" came up to the ship. Deciding to stay a bit back, he let Yuri handle the newcomers while keeping an eye on the surroundings. From his position, he tried to hear what they were talking about, but remained by the ship unless they needed him. Deep inside, he had a feeling that lift would be the root of many problems for them, and was curious what Kin's angle was with bringing these people here ...

Emily jumps dwon from the vent and into the room, attempting to land as lightly as possible so that she doesn't make a huge amount of noise and draw the defense turrets fire. As soon as her feet hit the floor she starts to move across the floor of the lab, her gun out searching for a target in the darkness but she decides not to take a shot since she can't see anything clearly and instead moves rapidly across the floor toward the table in the room with the containment field with the harvester hovering over it, having a look at the protections it's got putting it between herself and the defense turret.

Then the Jedi frowns as she realizes that Kin has brought someone aboard. Her eyes narrow as she looks over him, then shakes her head.
"This isn't part of the plan. I haven't heard anything about bringing anyone aboard," she states calmly to him. "So exactly what is it that you're doing? Are you trying to get us all killed?" The last is said with a raised voice, to indicate how she's definitely not feeling happy. "We already got a list over who should be aboard and those guys aren't on that list. If they need to get off there are other shuttles for them."

Leaving Kin and Fiolla to continue their argument, Yuri walks over to the scientists.
**"Like I said, we have received no word on additional people to be included on board this vessel, so you´ll have to forgive our confusion.

Sajin lands in a skidding crouch as a the turret he assails erupts in a shower of sparks behind him. He turns just in time to avoid a blazing red plasma-based death. Even still, he is not left unscathed, as avoiding the blast causes him to tweak his ankle ever-so-slightly. The Nagaian grits his teeth, ignoring the inconvenience of the pain and his fatigue as he concentrates upon his inner connection with the Force to fortify himself against what lay ahead.
Running to his left, Sajin somersaults onto the desk in his path and then sprints along its surface until he leaps off of it high into the air, landing on the far side of the lab in a skidding huff. It is a scant few seconds before he's weaving his way towards the remaining blaster turret, leaping into the air at the last second and bringing the lightsaber in a crescent arc, turning the motion into another somersault as he lands opposite the weapons emplacement.

"**Attention, this is not a drill. Proceed to the nearest evacuation point. Four minutes till critical overload.**"
**Lab**
As Sajin stands the turret's targeting system takes aim, only when it should have fired, there's only an audible click. Showing a great deal of athleticism, Sajin continues on toward the remaining turret, bounding onto the desk, and then into the air within reach of it. Bringing his saber to bear mid-jump, Sajin dexterously slices the barrel of the turret's main weapon. While it continues to function as can be seen by how it continues to whirl in its mounting to target Sajin, there's no noticeable weapon to attack with.
Emily falls from the vent, but lands awkwardly. Making a dash for the worktable, she takes cover behind it, unaware that the turret is now no longer a threat. Getting right to work, she first takes the time to examine the containment field.
==========================================
**Hanger** 
The scientists look between Drem, Yuri, Fiolla and Kin, blankly instead of their usual confusion. "You don't need our names," the man starts bravely. "And we will only relinquish our possessions once Jut-hakk himself is here to retrieve them." The woman nods her agreement and folds her arms over her chest to make her point. Neither of them are carrying any sort of baggage, and don't notice any weapons if they're hiding any under or within their lab coats.
Drem finds that the shuttle easily comes to life under his touch, and it doesn't take long for the engine ready light to come back as green. The deck hands obviously had done their job in making sure it would be ready as Ka'ra requested.
The loaded shuttle with its complement of two squads and cargo begins to take off, leaving the asteroid base behind. Also the lift rises once more, revealing a complement of at least three squads, which are then directed to your side of the bay, though with two other shuttles being prepped, its unclear which shuttle they're actually going for at this time.

**"Maybe you didn´t hear me, but yes I *do* need your names. Like I said i have a very clear list of people allowed aboard this shuttle, and you are not on it.

Rubbing his cheek a bit, he waited a few seconds for effect, before shrugging his shoulders.
**"I guess I could allow you to keep your possessions, but in that case you must present them to me first that I might list and note them. I wouldn´t be doing my job if I didn´t, I hope you understand that"**
In the back of his mind, Yuri hoped that the others were on their way. He wasn´t keen on trying to stall anyone wanting to get on board for ever, and it was a tricky balance between stalling each person long enough to make sure that there were a minimum of non-planned passengers on board when they took off.

"Echuta!" Fiolla exclaims, one of the few Huttese words that the young woman knows. This exclamation comes when the scientists appear to resist Kin and Drem's persuasion. "They are not on the crew list," she then states. "I really don't care whether they are sanitation workers or the greatest scientists aboard, 'cause we were told not to take anyone aboard not approved by the boss. And I've not heard anything from the boss."
With that said, she narrows her eyes a bit at Kin. "So please get them off this ship, otherwise I'm gonna throw them out myself. There's other ships and we got explicit orders. And unless I hear otherwise from the boss, well, then they should get off. So, what's it going to be? Do you tell them to get out or do I have to grab them in the neck and throw them out?"

The scientists not appreciating where things are going decide to take matters into their own hands. Having been lead only as far as the cargo hold of the shuttle, the man attempts to turn his counterpart around and attempt to leave. "**We'll make other arrangements then,**" he says.

"Fiolla," Began Kin in a calm tone, "Could you leave us for a moment? I think I need to explain the situation again to our friends here." He looked over towards the two scientists, "And lock the door on your way out."
The scarred Nautolan had hoped it wouldn't come to this, but a pair of unco-operative scientists seemed to be insignificant compared to what they apparently had. The retrieval of one of these weapons was important enough to assign a Cruiser and a team of specialists then this information was infintely more important. As was dealing with the scientists who researched it, letting them leave would just result in them begining their work again...

What is so important about these guys that we should have them aboard, when we weren't told about them? We should let them find another ship and then just wait for the rest of our crew, rather than do stupid things."
With that said, she turns her attention to the scientists. "We're not really built for passengers and I know if I let passengers get aboard without permission from the owner of this ship, there'll be no end to the grief he's going to give me. He might throw me out the airlock while in space or perhaps drop me off on some random planet there there's only bantha herders."

"You know why we're here Fiolla.." Kin began, begining to lose his calm tone, "What they have is bigger than all of that. If we let them leave then there''ll be not point in us having ever come here. He glanced over at the scientists as he chose his next words, "They have research that could let them replicate this Force Harvester as many times as they want to. And even when we take the data they could still carry on the work themselves if we don't stop them.." He turned away from her and back towards the two scientists..
"Fine, if you follow me i'll take you to Jutt Hakk's room. He isn't here yet but when he arrives I'll tell the Boss where to find you." Kin began to lead them towards the refresher, planning to lock the door shut once they were inside. Thrown in if it came to it.

Drem took in a deep breath as he checked the gauges. Feeling the engines online, he felt a bit relieved. Part of him imagined this horrible scene where thge engines wouldn't start and they were surrounded by angry Jedi. While he never really knew any personally, he imagined that wasn't a pretty sight ... nor one he was anxious to partake of.

While the two of you continue your squabble over the presence of the scientists, the scientists in question have managed to make their way to the ramp and are moving quickly down it. Nearby, troopers continue marching in a quick run, but don't seem to be heading toward your shuttle, just past it. Though, the troopers could very well hear any calls for help or any loud suspicious noises.
When Kin proposes escorting them further into the ship, they don't even look back and continue to walk, their trust over the validity over his supposed identity gone.

Emily finishes up examining the console continuing to keep the containment field between her and the blaster cannon as she doesn't know it has been taken out, once she has examined the field and worked out how to take it down and the fact that it is mostly there to hold up the harvester as opposed to hold anything in, she will poke her head out to check that the blaster cannon has been neutralised before she gestures Sajin over and says to him, **"I think I might be able to retract the field from the top giving you a chance to put the container over it, then you just keep the container in place until the harvester touches the work table, twist it off and put the cap on the container."** she pauses thinking and says, **"You did bring a container for it right?"** while looking around for anything that might serve the purpose, expecting that he likely didn't bring any such thing.

Sajin warily glowers at the turret as it spins, his lightsaber held before him in a defensive posture in an attempt to ward of any further attack. After a few blaster fire-free moments, the Nagaian prowls towards the door, standing just before it with his back to the floating orb at the rooms center.
**"If that has not alerted someone, then it likely soon will. We will have to move with greater haste."**
Breathing slowly, he stills his mind and searches through the force for any change in their situation, expanding his senses outwards to encompass those just outside the door, and for any sign of their Nautolan comrade.
When he is done, he turns back to Emily to listen to her suggestion. Nodding his agreement, Sajin then begins to cast about the area for any sign of a containment unit.
**"I did not, for I did not know how the Harvester was being contained. There must be one in the immediate area, I cannot imagine they would handle the artifact without."**
He begins his search around the worktable and the immediate area, keeping an eye towards the door for any sign that their cover was blown.

Emily was also looking around the table for a container that would be suitable and after a bit of searching she pulls out from underneath the table something that looks like it might be suitable, a square box about 2'6" on all sides, which has some embossed designs on, and pushes it over toward Sajin, saying **"Here this looks like it should do the job."** and then gets back in from of the console putting on her visor and plugging it into the table, **"Let me know when you are ready and I'll start lowering the field."**

Sajin stops the box with one hand and inspects the embossing on its exterior. He has barely enough time to respond in the affirmative before the young woman begins lowering the force field. The Nagaian begins to move with the haste he had cautioned earlier, deactivating his lightsaber and stowing it away before moving into position.
**"I could only tell that there is one guardsman at door, instead of the two we first passed. Whether the other one has left or is outside of my ability to perceive, I do not know. I also could not tell if the Nautolan remains either, be prepared to defend yourself once the door is open."**
With that, Sajin moves to secure the Force Harvester, fully cognizant of what is at stake should he falter in the least bit.

Once the field is down and the harvester secured she will draw a pair of knives that she had concealled on her person and will nod again at Sajin saying, **"I'm ready."**

**Lab**
With deft hands, Sajin is able to slip the orb that is the Harvester into the container. At the last moment when its about to be lowered to the table he twists the container so the opening is now at the top and the Harvester securely contained within. Both of you let out a breath of relief, the task now done. Looking into the crate, you notice the orb's light seems to dim a little. The lid snaps on with a hiss of released air and feeling around the edges there is no noticeable way to open it again. To the casual observer the container looks like a decorative box.
The container itself would never fit into the duct you entered through, which only leaves the front door. The guard Sajin sensed is on the other side of a decontamination area. The wall and door leading into the lab is made with a transparisteel allowing you to see into the area, and on closer inspection to see the door leading in to the hallway beyond. A control panel to the right of the first door has red indicators on it with two buttons, one yellow and the other green.
**"Attention, this is not a drill. Proceed to the nearest evacuation point. Two minutes till critical overload."**
==========================================
**Hanger bay / Hallway** (Fiolla)
The scientists take advantage of Kin's and Fiolla's distracting conversation and begin making their way down the ramp into the station's hanger bay. They look behind them as they pass the marching troops who are making their way past your shuttle to one closer to the bay doors. Their pace slows slightly, pausing they seem to be discussing their options. Finally they start walking again and make for the freighter, its ramp down in preparation to take on its passengers.
Kin mumbles his displeasure at having lost the scientists, but lets them go least it causes a scene. "**Come on, Fiolla. Let's go make sure we at least complete the main objective according to plan….**" He doesn't wait for her as he begins walking at a brisk pace back through the hanger bay, back to the hallway leading to the labs.
All the guards have now left their posts, having apparently decided not to be the last to be evacuated. The only remaining guards you see is the one outside of the lab door and another patrolling the hallway. Both seem to be very antsy, their hands clenching and unclenching around their weapons, one bearing a mean looking electrostaff and the other a heavy blaster rifle. Kin regards the two guards from around a corner and glances over at you. "**They haven't made it out yet. Any ideas?**"
**"Attention, this is not a drill. Proceed to the nearest evacuation point. Two minutes till critical overload."**
==========================================
**Hanger bay** (Drem)
You notice the two scientists who were aboard earlier make their way toward the lone freighter on the other side of the bay, closest to the entrance into the station proper. The lift has also started rising once more, but instead of the large amount of troops one might expect only a squad helping to lug crates of gear leave it. Droid haulers appear to haul off the larger pieces as the troopers begin a steady march toward your side of the bay. The shuttle resting furthest in front of you towards the bay doors takes on its passengers of troopers, raises its ramp and begins to take off.
Now aside from the freighter there is only one other shuttle in the bay besides yours.

Watching the scientists making their way to the other ship, Drem shakes his head and thinks, *Sonovaskug, I betcha that'll come back to bite us in the ass.* He sat and watched as the shuttle furthest in front of him took off and narrowed his eyes. Clicking on the gangplank controls, he attempted to raise the plank and shut the bay doors before anyone could get on. *Hope this works … or it's going to be a short trip. C'mon guys, time's running out.* Drem primed the gun controls and cracked his knuckles. **"Just in case …"** he muttered to himself.

"Unless they move very soon, we are forced to take other action I assume," she then whispers. "I do know how to trick the weakminded, but from the briefing it sounded like the crew were trained to resist. So I have no other suggestions."

Sajin completes his breathing exercises, regaining some semblance of equilibrium. He peers through the transparisteel door into the clean room, and then all around the room's interior in an attempt to assess the situation. Finally, his gaze lands on the control pad near to the door, and he gestures towards it with the hand containing his lightsaber.
**"That should deactivate the lock on the door there. If you can hack the keycode, then I will run through and attend to the remaining guard. From here on we stop for nothing until we are on the shuttle; should I fall take the Harvester and proceed without me."**
With that, the Nagaian activates his pale blade, the faint hum of the lightsaber hanging in stilted silence of the lab, only periodically interrupted by the emergency warning blaring around the station.

**Lab**
Emily moves toward the console ready to jury-rig it into opening it, only to discover that the door leading into the containment area doesn't have a lock on it. Pressing the yellow button, the doors open and the lights remain red. Once inside, pressing the yellow button again closes the doors.
It's not hard to figure out that pressing the green button will begin the decontamination process and at the end of the cycle open the door into the hallway. What isn't known, is how long the process will take and will the guards on the outside be given some indication this is occurring.
The crate holding the Harvester, you find, is not so much heavy as bulky. Weighing around 3kg, even the petite Emily can manage the crate with only the slimmest of difficulty, though with its size she may have some trouble running with it.

You manage to easily raise the ramp, but that only seems to draw attention from the deck hands as the hauler droids loading the ship begin to line up where the ramp had once been. After only a few minutes, you receive a comm transmission from the hanger control. "**Shuttle E3452, why have you restricted access? Lower your ramp to resume evacuation procedure.**" Comes the voice of a gruff man, obviously annoyed by the sudden complication you have presented to him.

Drem cleared his throat and then activated the com. **"There seems to be some issues with our hydraulics, Control. I'm working on the issue and should have it resolved momentarily. Did your techs even look over this ship?"** The scout tried to sound as annoyed as he could, hopefully adding to act in a beneficial way. **"Listen, I need to make sure this ship is in order before it can take off.

**"Do not be foolish. Securing this item is more important than my life, and if a time of choosing should come I would hope you would select wisdom over sentiment."**
Sajin speaks matter-of-factly, not flinching in the face of a discussion concerning his own demise. He watches as the young woman activates the doors leading into the containment area and listens closely as she explains the functionality of the panel of buttons. The Nagaian cants his head at an angle as he gazes at the door, nodding after a moment as if affirming something to himself.
**"Stand to the side of the door with the activation panel. When I give you the signal, press the green button to open the exterior door to the containment area. Hopefully that will draw the guard in to investigate. Once he's within the area, close it behind him and open the doors into the lab. With any luck, he will be lured further in where we can surprise him, otherwise we shall subdue him in the containment room."**
Moving to the opposing side of the doors, Sajin deactivates his lightsaber and crouches low and out of any viewing angle from the containment room. He motions for Emily to do the same, and when they are both in position, he gives her the signal.

Emily will head into the position that Sajin indicated, although she doesn't continue to argue with what he is saying she has already made up her mind and can be far more stubborn than Sajin is. Once Sajin gives the signal she will hit the button and stay beside the door redrawing her second knife while she waits for the door to cycle intending on letting him go out first.

**Lab** (Sajin and Emily)
Emily and Sajin take position inside the lab, Emily ready to the press the button to begin the cycle waits for Sajin to give her the signal. Sajin, taking position out of sight against the wall gives her a nod to proceed. Pressing the green button Emily moves out of sight of anyone looking through the decontamination room into the lab. The lights on the panel turn green as the door leading into the decontamination area is securely closed and after half a minute minute the door into the hallway opens. The dim artificial light from the hallway streams into the room, around the door frame the guard beyond peeks into the room. Only the silhouette of his helmet is visible to a perceptive Emily and Sajin.
He makes no move to come into the room. At first he just stands there looking in, but in the red haze of the lab beyond he can't distinguish anything. Rounding the corner he enters the containment area. He presses the green button by the lab door and the door into the hallway immediately closes behind him. At the same time, the lab is illuminated with the same dim lighting from the hallway. With rifle in hand the trooper moves to investigate the lab beyond through the glass. Peering through, his helmet clunks against the transparisteel as he presses against it in an attempt to get a good view.
It's nearing the end of the decontamination cycle and the trooper has been taking his time in his attempt to look around the corner of the wall to see around the wall to where he knows there's a potential hiding spot. Having apparently missed Emily as she hides behind the console - being small having its advantages- he unfortunately manages to catch site of the edge of Sajin's clothing as he shifts ever so slightly. It's then the doors to the lab open. As quickly as he's able he rears back attempting to put his back to the door to the hallway and hit the button to close the doors once more, effectively working to trap you two in there as you run out of time.

The technicians are also scrambling toward the last remaining shuttle, their work also apparently done. There's a line of cargo haulers forming outside of your ship, the supplies apparently forgotten by the technicians making haste toward their ticket to survival.

Making sure the comm was turned after after hearing the confirmation, Drem let out a sigh of relief. *Okay … you managed to buy sometime,* he thought, *Now what?* Looking around, the scout tried to keep an eye out for his team while also playing up his con and looking like he was working on 'The Problem'. Taking the time, he figured this would be a good time to familiarize himself with the rest of the ship, looking over its specs and systems and learning what he could just in case they needed it later. In the back of his mind, Drem considered what he'd stuffed in his boot ...

**"Move!"**
Sajin issues the command to Emily through clenched teeth before he rolls from his place of concealment and charges at the guard, concealed Harvester under one arm and his lightsaber in his free hand. Just before he strikes the soldier, he pivots into a spinning backfist and ignites the blade at the same instant, using the momentum from his swing in a devastating strike meant to decapitate the fleeing guardsman with a single stroke.
An inner turmoil simmers in Sajin, threatening to break through to the surface. He had lost focus with the inclusion of the new operatives on the mission, and had almost compromised them. He had lost focus in infiltrating the laboratory and nearly found himself and the young woman in his charge scorched for the effort. He had lost focus in subduing this solitary guardsman, and because of it their mission hang in the balance with the seconds ticking away.
And so the Nagai focused, his senses sharpening into crystal's clarity honed by a cold edge of fury. His blade moved as if of its own volition, seeking to overpower the guardsman; overpower the obstacle impeding the path to his objective. A trifling worry over the power in which he was immersing himself murmured at the back of his thoughts, but it was quickly silenced by the focus and the resolve that it provided.

Emily will move as soon as Sajin yells at her to do so, and makes his own move to take out the guard. She dashes toward the doors hoping to get through them before they close, she won't worry about the guard sure Sajin can handle him, and will merely dash out into the corridor, and start moving passed the pair of them toward the hanger.
She is careful not to move too fast for the moment just in case Sajin gets into trouble and she does actually need to go back to help him, with the two little knives held in her hands as she runs.

When the bickering started, Yuri called it quits on his attempts to keep the scientists off the ship, or at least make them as small a problem as possible once on board. He had been feeling pretty confident about that he would have been able to get the scientists to disclose their names and reveal any particularly interesting possessions they carried, thus at least making their presence more manageable. However, when first Kin started trying to forcefully get them on board, and Fiolla threatening them to get them to stay off the ship, he gave up. Without any kind of unity in efforts, he was wondering if the scientists would even buy that they were supposed to be there.
He remains quiet during the rest of the argument, letting Kin and Fiolla go on, and eventually walks down the ramp to keep an eye on the happenings in the hangar. He notes the two scientists leaving their shuttle, and then Kin and Fiolla walking away. He starts to note how empty the hangar bay becomes, and when he hears the stations comms proclaim that there is one a very short time left, he starts to get really edgy.
He leans towards the hull´s exterior, trying to appear as casual as possible.

Sajin urges the young girl into the room after the retreating soldier as Sajin charges in after himself. Bringing his saber around he ferociously attacks the soldier, tapping into his anger to fuel the attack. The lightsaber punctures the soldier's armor grievously in the gut, and its not much of a surprise when the soldier, in unbearable pain, slides down the wall to the floor.
Not before, unfortunately he was able to hit the button which closes the door to the lab trapping Emily inside. Recovering quickly he takes aim on the Jedi with his rifle, but with only one hand to support the weapon the shot goes wide.
Emily now trapped in the lab is forced to watch Sajin through the tranparisteal of the door and wall to the contamination room, as he dispatches the trooper within.

After Yuri's failed attempt to open the ramp, he takes position outside it, leaning on the shuttles hull. There's no one to observe as the bay has eerily emptied of all life. The techs who earlier were busy prepping the shuttles for launch have made it to their own evacuation points. Everything now appears to be automated. As evidenced by the hauler droids waiting in line at your shuttle's ramp with crates.
Drem takes his time in familiarizing himself with the shuttle and would be pleased to note that the shuttle does have at least two weapons in its arsenal. There's a buzzing sound from one of the consoles, an indicator someone was attempting to access the ramp controls. Peering out and down of the cockpit viewport, he can see Yuri mingling with the horde of hauler droids still waiting their turn to board.

**Hallway Outside Lab** (Fiolla and Kin)
Kin and Fiolla spot the lights on the panel outside the lab flicker and change from red to green and then finally the door opens. The guard jumps apparently surprised, and he peers in cautiously. Satisfied no one is in the initial room he steps in and the door closes behind him. The other guard takes position nearby ready to spring into action should his compatriot need his help. When his fellow goes in, he takes up the post next to the door, his electrostaff held at the ready for danger. Next to him, the console turns from green to red and then finally back to green, taking about half a minute, yet the door on this side remains closed.

Noticing Yuri, Drem cued up the ship's external speakers. **"PLEASE USE THE AIRLOCK ENTRANCE"** he boomed out. Walking to the airlock, he awaited Yuri and, upon his arrival, popped open the door, plugging in the code he'd used to lock the ship down: 362632. He chuckled a bit as the door popped open, but stood between the door and the entrance, blocking the way in. **"Any word from the others?"** he asked in a hush tone. Drem knew the bay was pretty cleared, but he wanted to make sure there was no one listening. **"Can you take a scout around and see if you can catch a glimpse of 'The Crew' … I think we may need to make an emergency exit soon. Oh, before you go, can I get your comm code? Just in case I need to reach you. I'll also send you the lock code as well, so you can get in. Let me know if you hit any problems, I'll see what I can do from here. Oh, one last thing, if anyone asks, the ramp isn't working properly, so we may not be able to take on anyone."** With that, the scout gave Yuri a wink and shut the door, locking it with the same code.

**"I haven´t seen or heard anything, though I think Kin and Fiolla are trying to keep an eye out for them. I do believe I have few tricks up my sleeve that can get me in a better vantage position than they are"**
Yuri have a pretty clear idea about how deserted the hangar is, but he falls into Drem´s manner of speaking quietly anyway. He sincerely hoped that the rest of his friends were on their way, and that they wouldn´t be having a legion of guards behind them when they finally arrived. He gave Drem his comm code and took the code to get into the ship, and once again he was reminded of what a mistake it had been not to coordinate comm codes better with the infiltration team.
He plugged his tiny comlink into his ear, clicking it once to test its functionality and then looked around. When he was confident no one would notice, he closed his eyes for a moment. He focused his mind on the light that passed around him and instead of allowing it to reflect normally on him, he covered himself in the Force, causing the light to bend around him, and he vanished from sight.
Certain his camouflage was in place, he opened his eyes and started moving towards the hallway. He passed Kin and Fiolla quietly, thinking them best unaware of his presence, and started to try and make his way towards where he remembered the lab was supposed to be.

"**I think… I think we've stopped him for now.**" he says huffing slightly. He turns to look at Ka'ra who is examining her uselessly hanging arm.
"**Chakaar dislocated my shoulder,**" she says through gritted teeth when Lanius moves to help her. Examing her arm, he nods in agreement of the prognosis. With her face hidden by her helmet, one can only assume it's crossed with pain.
"**Hold this,**" he says passing her his saber hilt. She holds it awkwardly in her free hand her rifle hanging off its sling on her good shoulder. He takes her useless arm in hand and with a disgustingly sucking and popping noise puts her arm back into place. He grabs her into a hug as she begins to fall forward. "**I shouldn't have gotten you involved.**" he says in a near whisper.
"**Like you had much choice. I choose this.**" she replies weakly through the helmets amplification speaker. Behind them down the hall, the door to the lifts begin to glow as a saber begins to cut through. They both watch the progress for a moment. "**Ni kar'tayl gar darasuum,**" she says her forehead resting against his shoulder.
"**I know, cyar'ika**," he responds and then taking his saber from her grasp ignites it as he turns, putting himself between her and the comming danger.

When he notices Ka'ra and Lanius, Yuri makes a halt. They don´t look very well, especially Ka'ra. Taking a few steps closer, he thinks of revealing himself, but when he sees Lanuis´s wary look towards the lifts he decides against it. Staying close enough to listen to them, he overhears their conversation. It seems they´ve been in a fight and may still be pursued. And while he hopes he is wrong, it does seem like it doesn´t take a genius to figure out who "him" is.
When he sees the brilliant glow of a lightsaber starting to tear through the doors to the lifts, he figures maybe their luck so far has run out. While still maintaining his cloak, he reaches inside his belt to pick out one of the flash canisters again. Weighing the small sphere in his palm, he reaches back with his free hand to pick out the metal cylinder from the holster he keeps strapped to his lower back.
Gripping it in his hand with the reversed grip he favored, he tried to center himself in the Force, to gather strength for whatever challenge is to come.

Sajin's eyes narrow to golden slits as his furious assault whittles the guard to within a centimeter of his life. His pale lightsaber flashes high, preparing to end the man's life with one final stroke, but something in the man's eyes triggers that nagging presence at the back of the Nagai's thoughts into a full out roar. The Jedi lowers his lightsaber slowly, the blade casting spidery shadows over staggered guardsman until the point of the blade is facing down.
Then suddenly he spins in a dizzying arc, laying a roundhouse kick on the side of the guardsman's armored head meant to send him sprawling to the clean room's pristine floor. After making sure that the guard was sufficiently subdued, he turns to peer through the transparisteel doors leading into the lab to watch as Emily speeds back towards the ventilation shaft they had used as an entrance.
Analyzing the door, Sajin looks for the weakest point in its joining as he prepares to slice through it. He takes a moment to set the Harvester delicately upon the floor and then squares his shoulders and plants his stance, angling the lightsaber for one pin-point thrust. Lastly, the Nagai closes his eyes and breathes slowly, finding stillness in the Force.

Sajin gives the guard a final and decisive round house kick, knocking the unfortunate guard's helmeted head into the wall. He slumps further down to the floor, only a final twinge as a reflex as his muscles relax indicating he's finally unconscious. Turning to examine the door, Sajin finds weak points in the joints of where the glass meets the metal brackets.
Behind her, Emily can see the glow of Sajin's weapon right up close to the transparisteel in preparation to cut through it.
==========================================
**Hallway** (Yuri)
Ka'ra as she turns to fully face the door, does a double take. Looking right in Yuri's direction, its hard to discern whether she's spotted him or not. If she does, she doesn't react for she continues the movement of turning to face away from Yuri toward the lift's door. Taking a kneeling position close to the wall, she takes a vantage point of where she can shoot around Lanius at the door. Looking through the scope she's carefully preparing her shot. Breathing deeply, she rests her injured arm over a knee to help brace her weapon.
Lanius takes a defensive stance, further up the wall. Far enough away to effectively avoid any debris, but close enough to engage who ever is on the other side of the lift. His patience is soon rewarded when the lift doors blast toward him. Using the Force he manages to stop their rush toward him, pushing them to the side of the hallway. From within the lift steps an elderly Zabrak, a blue saber lit in one hand as he faces off against his once trusted lieutenant.
"**I grow tired of your futile attempts, Lanius. You can't keep me from what I want.**" With a leer he glances at Ka'ra and then back to Lanius. "**There's only one way to stop me, and you aren't prepared for that.**"
His statement is answered by an array of blaster bolts fired from Ka'ra's weapon. While he deflects most away from him, some of the autofired attacks break through his lightsaber barrier. Brazened by her attack, Lanius charges the Zabrak lord.

Even though she can see Sajin about to cut through the door she has no idea how long it would take a weapon like his to slice though it, and begins to move the two chairs that are near the desks toward the vent that she came in through, and begins to search under the desks for objects to stack on top of them to make up enough of the distance that she can jump or climb back into the ventilation system.

**"Come, the way out will open soon, we must hurry!"**
Sajin then scoops up the Force Harvester and turns back to the door leading into the hallway, preparing to dash through it the moment it opens.

Yuri´s mind quickly raced across the options available. Given the things he had heard about Jut-Hakk, he was not looking forward to a confrontation with the man, but if it came down to that, he would not be running away from it. He caresses the small sphere in his hand for a moment, then draws back his arm for a throw. Hurling the small canister forward, he cries out to his ally, letting his cloak drop.

Emily works to move the chairs which she discovers are remarkably heavy. While the bases weren't bolted down, as she was pleased to discover, they were, however, kept in place with a remarkably weighted base. By the time she has pushed the closest chair to its position beneath the grate, Sajin has completed his work.The transparisteel is quickly cut away where Sajin discovered the weaknesses in the joints. With a small push of the Force, he removes the obstructing barrier and yells through to Emily.
It's then that the doors behind Sajin open into the hallway. Laying across the opening, is another guard his still sparking electrostaff laying beside him. The responsible party peeks in and Sajin can make out the silhouette of the Nautolaun soldier's head.

Yuri seeing the two strange pair in trouble pulls the pin from the canister and tosses it truly toward the Zabrak as he prepares to mount a defensive against Lanius. As the canister ignites in a blinding flash, encompassing Lanius and Jut-hakk both. Ka'ra shields her visor but otherwise seems unaffected. There's a clash of lightsabers as Jut-hakk moves forward distracting Lanius further with a vicious swing, making use of the blinding flash.
Jut-hakks attention now resides on Yuri as he moves past Lanius, blocking a riposte from the much younger man with ease. "**Ah, a new player. One with potential.**" He says with a wry smile. "**Too bad you've joined the wrong side, boy.**" The words begin to echo in Yuri's head as suddenly all he can see white and then black as if his own canister had been thrown back at him.

**Hanger Bay**(Drem)
The droids are apparently getting more feisty as they begin to slowly ram themselves against the bulkhead of the ship in an attempt to get in. Being now fully automated they are becoming more insistent in fulfilling their programming.
Aside from the droids causing a nuisance, Drem picks up a power signature coming from the remaining freighter as it slowly begins to inefficiently power up.

Sajin waits until Emily is out of the lab and into the hallway before he is running after her and Kin. The Nagai abandons all pretense of stealth in favor of haste, his lightsaber casting sparks wherever it encounters a wall or an obstacle as they make their escape.
He stretches out through the force, gaining the lay of their surroundings as they progress. As bruised and weary as he felt, Sajin did not think another surprise would bode well for their fledgling group. But if they were to encounter one more, the Jedi was determined to cut through it and get the artifact off of the station at all costs.

Blinded and confused, Yuri flinches in shock, not really sure what had just happened. Well of course he knew, even though he wasn´t sure of the details, and he was well aware that he had little to oppose it with. He was a student of battle, a disciple of the blade, and not at all experienced in fending off attacks in the Force. During the war he had never had to, since the Sith Assasins that came after him and his master were straightforward enough with their blades and lightsabers.
He struggled to regain his focus when he suddenly felt someone grab hold of him and start pulling him away. Nearly igniting his lightsaber and lashing out, his vision focuses enough to recognize Ka'ra, dragging him away from the battle. Regaining his bearings, he frees himself from her grip to allow them both to pick up their pace. He wasn´t even going to argue with her about trying to help Lanius. If she had intended to stand and fight, she would have. And from what he had heard and seen of Jut-Hakk, her instincts in this matter were probably correct.
Mustering a surge of mental power to stay focused, he turned his head quickly towards her, letting her try to read the feelings in his eyes for a second. He hadn´t needed to understand the words spoken in Mando'a to understand how she must feel.

Emily intends to bolt through the now open door and run as fast as her short petite legs are able to carry her toward the shuttle attempting to keep up with the significantly larger men running with her. She'll move the knives back from their sheaths into her hands just on the off-chance they run into more trouble on the way back but she is concentrating on running, not even having the breath to spare for idle chit-chat.

Ka'ra let's go of Yuri, happy to let him move under his own power provided he heads away from the conflict and toward safety. His eyes meet hers and though he can't see what's there behind the visor, his soul is laid bare to her. Moving quickly she focuses her attention once again on where they are going.
"**It's not over yet**," she says decisively. As long as there was a chance, she wouldn't lose hope they would all survive this.
The sound of running feet behind her draws her attention and her helmeted head turns to see who was running their way. “**Go**,” she says to Yuri, spotting Sajin in possession of the box with the Harvester and Emily trying to keep up with her short legs. “**Keep going. Don’t stop,**” she adds to the command and moves back down the hall to once again take up a covering position. “ **Ib'tuur jatne tuur ash'ad kyr'amur**” she says to herself as she walks away, the words barely audible to the former Jedi.
As Sajin and Emily turn the corner from the hallway to the labs, they can spot Ka’ra further down. Taking a position on their left in the hallway, she sets her sights toward one particular hallway, ready to fire. The sounds of a lightsaber battle are more evident here as they echo off the bulkheads, giving more haste to the two’s retreat toward safety. Just as the Kin is about to pass the hallway, Lanius comes flying to collide with the far wall. He shakes his head stunned, his emerald saber still ignited in his hand. Pausing, Kin takes aim at the presence, providing enough of an opportunity for Lanius to regain his feet. There’s a determined grimace on Lanius’s expression as he spots Sajin and Emily with the Harvester “**Move it!**” he yells at Kin as he charges past only to lock blades with the elderly Zabrak.
Hurrying past, Emily and Sajin are able to bear witness to the conflict between the Jedi and his former teacher. Steadily the younger Jedi is being pushed back, giving ground slowly in order to provide the time needed for the two to get past. Jut-hakk looks up spotting the two with his prize and in a fit of rage once again commands the Force. His saber moves in a blur as he pushes Lanius back quicker than ever. From not far away Ka’ra yells for Sajin and Emily to keep going.

Not planning to argue, Yuri nods to Ka'ra and slips his saber back into its sheath and continues to move towards the hangar. With a quick glance over his back, he notices Sajin and Emily further down the hall. He shrugs a bit as he spots Lanius come flying out from his battle with Jut-Hakk, but takes a deep breath to steady himself and lifts his hand towards his ear, pressing the comlink.

Not expecting to hear the ship's comm crackle to life, Drem jumped a bit in the pilot's chair as he heard Yuri's voice come across it. **"Uh … yeah, yeah …"** he stammered into the comm. **"We're good to go … I'll lay down some cover fire if you need it."** That said, he brought the ship's weapons online and targeted the remaining ships or groupings that he could, aiming on what seems to be dangerous first. **"Better make sure everyone's on their way, I'll keep an eye open and drop the bay doors when I see you,"** the scout said, gearing up for some serious trouble *Easy does it, Drem … easy does it.*

Emily hesitates and comes to a stop as she and Sajin head down the corridor near the fighting clearly torn about leaving Lanius behind even though she barely knows him. She looks between the two fighting Jedi and Sajin wondering if he is going to continue toward the ship or try and hand her the harvester and get involved himself. Her gaze also flickers to Ka'ra down the hallway in a covering position waiting for them, clearly unsure what to do as she stands there waiting and thinking, her eyes shifting from person to person.
She has no intention of taking the harvester off him, if he hands it too her she is going to dump it on the ground and remain at his side like she had indicated earlier having no intention of letting him sacrifice himself. If he doesn't and continues toward the hanger, she will look at the scene for a moment longer and before she resumes running toward the hanger.

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Anazider** (2010-08-11 23:03:24)

A slight stitch has begun to form in Sajin's side, the efforts of the mission starting to wear on him.
*Keep moving.*
He ignores it as he runs around the corner, away from the lab, at full speed. He leaps over scattered debris and nimbly negotiates the corridors on his way towards the shuttle bay. Coming around the bend, he finds Lanius locked in mortal struggle with Jut-Hakk. Upon seeing the elderly Zabrak, a sneaking tendril of righteous fury blooms in him, begging to put due to the one so infused with the darkside.
*Keep moving!*
The Nagai heavily tamps down the anger and rushes on. Emily looks to him, and he can read her thoughts as clear as the suns of Tattooine at noon: If he stops, she will no matter what he may think. The anger returns, and threatens to spill over when he sees Lanius kept tossed so carelessly about the other Jedi was a true comrade in the Covenant's efforts to preserve the Order and stem the rise of the darkside.
*KEEP MOVING!*
Over and over again Sajin spurs himself forward, through fear, anger, and doubt to complete his mission. Protecting the Jedi Order and eliminating any threats to his prosperity, that was his duty as a Shadow, and one he held with an almost fanatical esteem. At that very moment, the largest threat to the Jedi Order, and the very galaxy itself, was tucked neatly under his arm and the thought of the Harvester's might was enough to push him past all fatigue, pain, and emotion to get on board the awaiting shuttle.
And so he sped on, past friend and foe alike, never looking back...

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Alicia** (2010-08-12 08:56:49)

With the bay devoid of life, the only movement comes from the hauler droids still attempting to access the cargo hold of the transport. Close to the door, the freighter continues to power up its engines, but as far as Drem knows only the two scientists have made it on board, even the ramp is still down.
Yuri makes it into the hanger first and makes a beeline toward the transport, but with the ramp still down he has to use the access code to open the hatch. The loitering droids slow him down as he finally makes his way onto the ship. Not far behind him is Kin and Fiolla and they too cross the threshold into safety, Fiolla panting heavily at the outright run. She stays by the hatch, intent on helping anyone else who makes it into the ship.
Sajin and Emily urge themselves onward past the dueling Jedi. Behind them Lanius is once again shoved against the wall in a stunning feat of Force ability. As the two flee past Ka'ra she fires a burst of autofire at the Zabrak and then turns to follow them. Regaining his composure, Lanius begins to quickly follow, moving backwards in the hallway as he raises his hands. Wind begins to cyclone in the small space around the point just in front of Lanius and with the motion of his hands quickly turns into a lightning storm and all moisture in the air becomes acid. He backs away as the storm wages on without his control and the Zabrak disappears from view beyond it. Turning to outright flee, Lanius follows behind Ka'ra.
Over the speakers the station goes into a final countdown, the message plays not only in the station but through the transports loud speakers. "***Overload imminent. Five seconds till overload.***"
As he hits the bay, he quickly urges the three in front of him into the freighter before they pass it completely, boarding the ship himself. Ka'ra turns only slightly to have to adjust her course and stays at the gangplank to urge Sajin and Emily on. "**Quickly, there's no time!**" Through her comms she contacts the transport, her voice echoing in the cockpit. "**Go, leave. We'll be right behind you.**" The freighters engines quickly hum in full power and as Emily and Sajin board it begins to lift. As the ramp closes Emily and Sajin can hear the first signs of the overload as the generators explode deep within the station.
The droids beside the transport are jolted and a couple topple over spilling their cargo, which Fiolla and anyone still at the hatch discover was filled with heavy blaster rifles and another bars of refined ore. Kin, Fiolla and Yuri have to fight to keep their feet as the station shakes and then the transport quickly fires its thrusters an emergency take off. Quickly following behind the freighter they two ships barely manage to break through the dissipating shield into space as a fiery blast follows behind them.
********************************************************************
On the freighter, there's a cacophony of noise as one of the scientists begins a tirade against Lanius, the exact words are hard to understand from where Ka'ra, Sajin and Emily collapse to the floor from exhaustion and, in Ka'ra's and Sajin's case, their wounds. Ka'ra stares at the box Sajin set down beside him and asks, "**Please tell me that is it…**"
********************************************************************
Being the last one out, the transport sustains the most damage from the explosion of the station. Having been rocked and jolted around, anyone having been on their feet is quickly relieved of it, finding themselves in an awkward state. Alarms wail in the cockpit and its all Drem can do to keep the transport on a steady course following the freighter. With still the asteroids surrounding what once was Acheron station to maneuver through, its questionable whether the transport will make it.

Emily lies on the floor of the freighter panting trying to get her breath back, it's been awhile since she's had to run quite that hard. In between deep breaths she pants out, **"Yeah, that's it."** as she realises that Ka'ra and Sajin are both injured she asks, **"Are you going to be okay?"** directing it at both of them.

Knocked off his feet, Yuri lies down a few moments to catch his breath and shake off the last remains of whatever attack Jut-Hakk had exposed him to. Sending his feet up into the air, he jumps back into a standing position, but have to drop low to retain his balance and avoid falling down again.
As he regains his balance, he heads for the cockpit. Not that he wasn´t interested in seeing the Force Harvester, wanted to speak to Lanius, or generally just check in with the rest of the group, but he figured they weren´t quite out of it yet. It seemed like the ship had taken some heavy beating, and he had no idea if perhaps the other ships that had been in the hangar was hanging around somewhere.
Placing a hand on the cockpit doorway, he looks over at Drem.

Trying to hold the ship steady, the scout looked past their current location and into the newly scattered asteroid field. *Son of a Murglak,* he thought, his mouth gaped open at the feat before him. Hearing Yuri come in and question their status, Drem turned to him, his mouth still gaped as if it were a Hapan Wasp trap. **"Doing?"** He retorted. **"Doing? What was a quick getaway has turned into a nightmare for even the most seasoned of daredevils. I think, at our present state, the proper response is 'Terrified for my life, and you'?"** Looking to the debris, the corellian did what he could to avoid the larger asteroids, but it'd only be a matter of time before the smaller ones would shoot through the hull like shotgun shells.
Thinking for a moment, he remembered the device that Ka'ra had given him before this whole fiasco started. Reaching into his boot, he pulled it out and pressed the button on the transmitter. Deep down, he hoped that *The Valiant* would find them before they resembled a piece of old Mantellian cheese.

Sajin extinguishes his lightsaber as the freighter's ramp closes behind them, slumping to a knee as the starship shudders to life beneath them. He takes a moment to delicately set the Force Harvester's case on the floor before ripping at his clothing for a cord with which he ties back the raven-black hair plastered to his face.
**"If it is not, then we owe Master Jut-Hakk one space station… and a sincere apology."**
The Jedi grunts to himself as he reaches behind his back and sheathes his lightsaber, stifling a grimace at the pull and twinge of battle-worn muscles. Folding his legs beneath himself, Sajin sits comfortably on the freighter's cargo-bay floor, content to rest for the moment.
**"And I am well- as well as can be expected at any rate- and shall recover soon. I believe I would be better if a certain someone had more sense than sentiment when the loves of billions hung in the balance."**
He turns lazily to glance at Emily, although the look in his eye is direct and his tone stern. He shakes his head, spraying droplets of sweat from his brow and the hastily-made ponytail before bowing his head and turning to a meditative silence, the Force Harvest box sitting before him.

Emily shrugs as Sajin scolds her for her sentimentality and smiles a little as she replies, **"What do I care about billions of people?"** her smile widens and takes on a definite mischievous overtone as she continues **"It's not like I know them."**
She pushes her way to her feet a little unsteadily her legs clearly not happy with the idea of carrying her further at the moment, but she doesn't feel like just lying around either. She half staggers to the nearest wall where she puts a hand against the wall to help support herself as she watches Sajin meditate and Ka'ra rest on the ground, her mind clearly thinking as she does so.

Drem sighed a frustrated sigh. It wasn't that he was frustrated with Yuri, but more at the situation. Looking over the controls as he attempted to bank and maneuver any incoming obstacles, the scout said, **"If you can make these controls respond better or have any luck with the ship's cannons, I'd gladly have you at the co-pilot's station. Otherwise, I'd suggest strapping in because this isn't going to be an easy trip."** Turning his full concentration back to the task at hand, Drem tried to remember what it was his uncle had said about asteroid fields ...

Yuri figured he´d be at most use with the guns. He wasn´t particularly adept at handling heavy weaponry, though he knew if it was necessary he could call upon the Force to aid him. Not to the same extent he did in a lightsaber duel, but it would still be some help.

Tapping a few buttons, Drem tried to bank the ship from one of the larger asteroids, while attempting to bank around a swarm of smaller ones. *Bloody nass!* he thought as the ship moved like a slug. *We get out of this alive and I'm going to spend a few years in a transport sim.* Hearing Yuri, the scout muttered, **"Anything that looks like it could put a hole in us, or knock down the shields. Avoid the big ones though, because frakking one of those will get us even more trouble, y'know? Just keep an eye out for any ships … especially familiar ones."** He gritted his teeth in exasperation. *C'mon you pregnant space slug, just work,* he thought towards the ship.

Ka'ra gives a grunt of affirmation when Emily asks if she's alright. "**Better than I expected, adi'ka,**" she says slowly, shifting slightly to unencumber her good arm from her rifle so she can reach up and take off her helmet. There's beads of sweat on her forehead, even though her armor must have internal cooling and heating. Slowly she makes it unsteadily to her feet, exhaustion finally taking its toll. "**There's enough time later when we're back on the *Titan's Valiant*. Let's go see who Lanius is arguing with.**" Sligning her rifle over her shoulder she makes her way carefully and slowly to the cockpit.
The ship shakes and jolts sporadically as Lanius dodges one large asteroid and then another. Beside him the two scientists badger him with questions, fear written on their face. All the while Lanius attempts to keep a cool head as he tries to keep them all alive. The explosion from the station apparently having disrupted any semblance of order the field had .
******************************************************
Drem fights the controls as the main starboard thruster fires, misfires and then finally gives out. All that's left are the maneuverering jets and those provide very little thrust. Looking at the sensors, though, he's able to spot Lanius as he makes his way steadily out of the field in what appears to be a reasonably clear path. Clear enough in the sense that he's been successful so far in avoiding the largest of the asteroids.
The transmitter after pressed begins to beep slowly, but steady.

**"Ohh … this is so not good,"** the scout muttered as the starboard thruster dies out. **"We've got trouble"** Drem said to Yuri as he slid from his seat and began jogging to the back. **"Ask anyone if they have some experience fixing a ship … and send out a mayday … and answer the frakkin' comm!"** he yelled back to his "gunner" as he left the cockpit. **"Here's hoping there's a replacement coil or auxiliary fuse that can be hotwired,"** he grumbled as he made his way down to engineering, making sure his commlink was on and receiving on the way. Though his mind was on fixing the ship, he hoped the others had made it out as okay as it looked.

Sajin's eyes slowly flutter open as it is becoming readily apparent that he won't be doing much meditation any time soon. The Nagai actually liked children, they were innocent and carefree enough, but he is reminded that he doesn't much care for children old enough to know that they are being rude.
**"Oh but you do know them: they are the comrades that fought alongside you on the station, any friends or family you have from wherever you hail, or even those you have had dirty dealings with in the past. These are not times for children; I would rather you morn my loss with those very friends, the galaxy safe, then to have you give in to sentiment and pass into the Force along with me."**
He rises to his feet and dusts his hands on his torn jacket. The Jedi then begins to remove various bits of encumbering gear and tie them to his rucksack, which he then stows in a corner of the cargo hold. Sajin then gathers up the Force Harvester and wraps its distinctive case in a shirt, obscuring it. Tucking it under an arm before he moves along with the two young women, Sajin quirks an eyebrow at the pair berating Lanius.

The Nagai then does look down at the young woman, his golden-eyed gaze penetrating and, in conjunction with his pale features, somewhat unsettling.
**"That would have failed the mission, and countless others depending on us. The mission is paramount; failure, especially because of impetuous emotion, was not an option. If you refuse to say that, then you prove my earlier statement correct: this is no place for children."**

On board the freighter, Ka'ra having made it to the cockpit before the others grabs the human male by the scruff of his collar with her one hand. In an impressive show of strength, nearly lifts the taller man off his feet as she shoves him toward the exit to the cockpit. "**Sit down, shut up, or get spaced,**" she threatens and then she turns her attention to the woman, who gets the hint and also makes her way to the exit in a huff.
"**Why I never…**" the woman starts to the man, but doesn't finish the sentence as Ka'ra turns to glare at her. As they get out of ear shot the woman whispers to the man. "**Jut-hakk will not be pleased about this at all.**"
Busy at the controls Lanius doesn't look up as he fights to keep the ship on course of the asteroid turned debris field. Now less distracted, Ka'ra motions for Emily to hurry up so she can assist Lanius as co-pilot.<div style="text-align: center;">

Yuri takes the gun controls for the transport and finds that only the pin point defense lasers are still actually functioning. The comms, as he opens all frequencies, reveal only static - without anyone attempting to contact them all he gets is space interference. With no pilot, the transport continues to move at the same speed, cruising from its earlier momentum before the thruster went out. Yuri is soon busy blasting away any of the small debris that happens to be making its way toward the ship and is then easily dissipated by the shields. However, a large bogey appears on sensors as he quickly realizes the transport's course is leading them right towards a large asteroid.
Upon entering the bay, Drem would recognize a series of crates containing starship parts which had managed to make its way back on the ship. Not knowing exactly what's contained within, there's a chance it may or may not contain the parts Drem needs to fix the thruster. Fiolla follows Drem to the engineering section of the transport, which turns out to be a crawl space under some removable plates set in the floor of the expansive cargo bay. "**I'm not too experienced with mechanics, Drem, but I can at least hand you the tools you need. How would you like me to help?**" Fiolla asks.

I've been taking care of myself for years, and it's not just luck that I survived this long I can take care of myself."** and there is a pause before she continues in a slightly quieter tone but one clearly meant to carry **"Although I'm amazed you've survived this long with the martyr looking for a place to die attitude."**
Then her eyes stop being narrowed and she continues in a softer tone, **"It's not like getting yourself killed would have helped anything, what if down the very next corridor there had been a bunch of armed guards? While you were off committing suicide, you'd have put the mission at risk. One thing I did learn while surviving is you never leave your partner behind."**

Starting to get the hang on things, Yuri did the best he could to blast away at the stuff that looked like it could pose a danger to the ship. Unfortunately he was limited to the smaller guns of the ship, meaning a lot of stuff still got through, and he wasn´t going to bet all his luck on the shields holding out. This wasn´t a combat vessel after all. With the beeping of the comm dead, he turns his attention to another monitor, making a rather disturbing discovery. The shuttle appears to be headed for a rather sizable asteroid. Turning his head around, he shouted towards the back of the ship.
**"Hey guys, anyone with some flying experience mind coming up here? I *really* don´t think you want us to continue on our present course"**
Without waiting for a response, he switched the chair to the pilot´s seat. He would try to do what he could to get them off course (hopefully to a safe one), but given the poor condition of the ship, it might be more than his skills could handle.

**"It is obvious that you will not learn this lesson just this moment, and master Lanius requires your assistance. If you insist on being an obtuse adolescent when we are safe, I will then indulge you."**
Sajin sweeps a hand at the empty co-piloting chair, his eyebrow quirking at Emily as he corners her with a decision. The Nagai grunts in sardonic amusement as Ka'ra drags away one of the scientists, and instills a healthy fear into them both.
Squaring his stance, the Jedi folds his arms across his chest and stands just behind the piloting chairs, watching with a stoic placidity as Lanius desperately attempts to save them all. He opens his mind and thoughts to the Force, so very close to the possibility of joining it, and finds stillness amidst the chaos.

Emily looks at the back of Sajin as he turns away to help Lanius with a slightly infuriated expression feeling that he just isn't listening to what she is saying, but she can't argue with the fact they have more important things to worry about at the moment, and she heads into the cockpit like Ka'ra wanted her to and moves toward the co-pilots seat to help Lanius with getting them through this alive.

Despite Yuri's ministrations of the pilot controls, he just can't get the remaining thrusters to fire enough to maneuver them away from the path of the asteroid. It's quickly apparent as well that bringing the ship to a stand still in an asteroid field is just about as dangerous as the impending collision. Managing to fire the thrusters enough to angle the ship all Yuri can do now is cross his fingers and hope the trajectory is enough to by pass the asteroid all together.
Fiolla sets about the task Drem provided for her as he gets to work trying to locate what exactly the problem is. Unfortunately, even the *Krasser's Guide to Starship Mechanics* isn't enough to help Drem track it down as he looks over conduit, coil and fuse. "**Drem! These are all starship parts!**" she says calling down into the engineering crawl space.<div style="text-align: center;">
***********************************************
</div>

The scientist move toward the lounge of the ship, still whispering to themselves at the indecencies of Mandalorians, Ka'ra in particular, and how Jut-hakk wasn't going to be very pleased with how his lieutenant was allowing them to be treated as they had, after all discovered what he wanted. Ka'ra follows behind them to ensure they don't cause any more trouble, her face pale and exhausted. She ignores their jibes and curses concerning her heritage as well as some others regarding her own personal honor when those don't work.
Lanius with Emily's assistance manages to quickly and safely bring the freighter out of the asteroid field. Letting out a sigh of relief he graces Emily with a small tired smile. "**Thank you, young one,**" he says to her before turning his attention back to the sensors. "**Doesn't look the others have made it out yet.**" Fiddling with the knobs he attempts to clear the distorted sensor data.

**"Huh…not enough juice left, eh? Well that´s not good…"**
The thrusters just didn´t seem to cut it, so Yuri started to think of alternative ways to get out of this. If the main guns had been working, they might have been able to blast that big piece of rock into smaller parts that the shuttle´s shields might have been able to handle. But doing it with these small lasers would be of no use. He started to look over the console, trying to find anything useful, even though he knew he´d only recognize about half of the buttons. Sensors, comm, ramp control...none of them would do. This was starting to drift more and more towards coming down on luck.
*There is no such thing as luck, there is only the Force…*
When the voice echoed in his head, Yuri sat quiet for a few moments. Through the Force, anything was possible. Unfortunately, he had received training that differed from most Jedi, and required the heat of battle, the thrill of combat, to utilize the full potential of his power. His telekinetic skills were meager at best, and would not suffice here. However, there was someone else on board that could possibly help them. He clicked the comm button.

**"Poodo!"** The scout swore as his limited knowledge of the ship got the best of him. Thinking for a moment, Drem took a deep breath and cleared his mind, thinking back to the days he would help Jindo, his Uncle Gym's mechanic. **"If you bypass the subroutines of the main power juncture,"** he began mumbling, trying to unlock some mnemonic trigger that he may have from his younger years, **"The relays could power up without the use of the fuse inductor coil …"** Taking the wire cutters, he looked over the control boards on the engine's main power juncture and snipped the black wires, re-wiring them into the secondary manifold. The way he figured it, the engines would either fire up, or power could short out ... either way, the odds weren't much worse than what they were facing ...
Okay … trying Mechanics again (+8) to see if he can Jury Rig the engines enough to clear the asteroid field …

### **Anazider** (2010-08-21 17:00:56)

With the starship clearing the debris field, Sajin nods to himself and turns to leave the cockpit behind, trusting in Lanius's ability to see them to safety. The Nagai stalks his way back into the lounge, standing just within the threshold as he listens to the muttered implications by the scientists, his head canting at an angle and causing his raven-dark hair to fall to one side.
Sajin strides towards where the scientists sit and takes a seat directly opposite them. He remains silent for a long time, merely staring at them with his pale, spectral visage and disquieting golden-eyed gaze. After a long, quiet moment of nothing but staring, he speaks over his shoulder to Ka'ra.
**"You need to rest; your injury appears to bother you still, and I can sense your fatigue from here. I can watch our guests."**
Leaning forward, the Nagai is all smiles and his tone is very pleasant, but the look in his eyes is almost lifeless. He sets the wrapped bundle under his arm across his thighs, and plants both of his hands on his knees.
**"In fact, I think I would very much like to *ask* our guests some questions, while they are in *such* a talkative mood. You see, I am in no way employed by Jut-Hakk, and so there will be no one to report too if I decide to treat you both *very* poorly."**
That perfect, sinister, dead-eyed smile is ever-present. Although the Jedi had little intention of following through on his implied threats, he had grown rather tired of the scientists rudeness. Perhaps the recent mission and his brief argument with the obtuse little girl had something to do with it, but he shunted the thoughts aside as inconsequential. He allows them to *feel* just how dangerous he can be while never leaving his seat.
**"But! I suspect there will be no need for that, because we all will become very good friends very soon. And very good friends do not insult each others heritage or person. Know why? Because they are very good friends! Very good friends also answer each other's questions, precluding the need for one very good friend to painfully interrogate the other very good friends unto unconsciousness. That's just what very good friends do, wouldn't you agree?"**

Fiolla takes a couple moments to get to the cockpit but appear she does. "**I hope this is important. Drem is relaying on me to help with repairs,**" she says her arms crossing with some annoyance. Her attention turns to the asteroid growing larger in the viewport her eyes growing slightly wider. Turning her attention back to Yuri her gaze is questioning.
With a snip and a twist of wires, an arc of sparks cascade around Drem as the power is transferred. From the crawl space, Drem can hear the thrusters power up and then seem to cough, stalled. Giving the bottom of the control board a kick, the thrusters once again attempt to power up and then, miraculously, thrum to life.<div style="text-align: left;">
*******************************************
</div>

Lanius shakes his head, "**With the interference we're getting from the field we would have to head back in to attempt to locate them and even then we'd have to be close, within several kilometers at the very least.**" Adjusting the controls on the comm he opens up the frequencies, switching from one to another in an attempt to see if they had put out a SOS. "**If we don't get any contact then we'll have to leave them behind and meet up with the Valiant.**" He heaves a sigh. "**Getting the Harvester to safety is a priority. If they're smart and the Force is with them, they'll make it out of this.**"
Ka'ra smiles at Sajin bleakly taking a seat in one of the lounge's chairs setting her rifle beside it in full view of the scientists. **"I'll be fine, but thank you for your concern,**" she says with some stubbornness, though with her arm already set, only a bacta tank or a pain killer were probably the only solutions aside from rest to soothe her injury. Fully intending on sticking around, she leans back into the chair cradling her injured arm against her chest as she watches the exchange between them.
The scientists look between each other at Sajin's not so honeyed threats of violence toward them. The woman looking rather alarmed starts to quake in her seat. Neither of them seem about to disagree with the Nagai, though a certain reluctance to cooperate is evident as they seem to fear Jut-hakk more than the Nagai in front of them. Suffice to say, Sajin's rebukes stop their conversation and they just sit there quietly, looking between Ka'ra and her rifle beside her and the dangerous looking Nagai Jedi.

*Well, if your presence there was crucial, would you have left?*, Yuri thinks to himself, but doesn´t say it out loud, instead he turns to look at the asteroid.
**"You said you had had some Jedi training, right? And Jedi can move things with their minds, yes? I was wondering if you think you could do something about that thing ahead. Because I really don´t look forward to flying straight into it, and as far as I can tell, the thrusters don´t have enough power to veer us of course"**
He knew he was asking a lot of her, and he supposed she had some thoughts in her mind right now like "It´s too big", "I´m not strong enough" or simply "It can´t be done". However, he knew it to be possible, and even if he himself lacked the necessary control to perform such a feat, perhaps she didn´t. And of course, he would be right there to aid her, although quietly.

Sajin peaks back over his shoulder at the armored warrior, her discomfort evident even though she does an admirable job of enduring it. In looking at Ka'ra, the Nagai notices that this is perhaps the first time he has seen her without her helmet. The Mandalorian was pretty, even as drawn and pale as she now was, but what struck the Jedi most was her youth. If he was a betting man, he would hazard a guess that he was as much as 10 standard years older than the young woman.
**"Suit yourself. It is your health, after all…"**
And then the sudden realization that two impetuous young women have ignored his advice this day causes him to smirk. He turns that look on the now-sullen pair of scientists, using the smirk to further his intimidation.
**"Ah… The sweet, sweet quiet of a moment shared between very good friends! Yes, I believe I will accept this over immediate answers, but only so long as you maintain this *companionable* silence for the remainder of our trip. There will be *plenty* of time for questioning once we reach our destination, hm?"**
The golden-eyed Nagai tucks the bundled Harvester under his arm again and makes an obvious show of picking imaginary-bits of lint and dust from his battle-torn clothing. When the garment passes his inspection, he stands, and after winking to the pair of scientists huddled on the divan, he stalks out of the lounge towards the cargo bay. Once there, he retrieves his gear-pack, and then strides off to explore the rest of the ship and requisition a space for himself.

Coughing out a bit of grease and smoke, Drem paused for a moment as he heard the familiar chugging of the engines. **"The engines are online?"** he questioned himself in a mutter. **"THE ENGINES ARE ONLINE!"** The elated shout resonated almost above the engines as the scout jumped in success. Taking a few seconds, his smile quickly became worry as he realized where the ship was. **"Frak!

Fiolla gives Yuri a nod and then moves to take a seat at the forefront of the ship in the only available chair, the pilot's. Taking a quick calming breath her eyes close and her focus extends to the asteroid beyond. Even with Yuri's assistance she's only able to nudge the asteroid away from the ships trajectory. It doesn't stop her from continuing to attempt it though as beads of sweat begin to form on her brow from her determination.
She almost jumps out her seat as Drem comes running in shouting, "FIRE THE THRUSTERS! FIRE THE THRUSTERS!"<div style="text-align: center;">

Lanius can only give a nod to the young girl in response. "**We'll give them some time. Till then we can continue to run sensor sweeps so we won't be caught unawares.**" Relaxing in his seat he closes his eyes to meditate, taking a deep breath as he seeks out his apprentice through the Force.
The two scientists glance between each other again, but obviously not wanting to cause themselves trouble remain quiet. Their growing fear, however, can be felt in the air and could be cut with a knife. As Sajin turns to leave, Ka'ra gives him the slightest of nods in thanks as she adjusts herself in her chair, obviously not intending on going anywhere. Sajin will find the layout is standard for a dynamic-class cruiser, with the dormitories on either side of the ship.

Sajin gives himself a tour of the freighter, inspecting its durasteel halls with a critical eye. He did not have any intimate knowledge of starship design, aside from the handful that he had served on throughout his career, but he did have a sense for structure, and symmetry. The layout of the Dynamic cruiser plays to his sensibilities, and he gives it an approving nod, trailing his finger tips along the wall as he continues.
Heading towards the port dormitory, Sajin pauses in mid-stride as he passes the empty cargo bay, and with one last look for the bunk area, turns into the storage zone instead. Once inside the cargo bay, he walks the entirety of its interior, spreading his hands out to gain a better feel for dimensions. Nodding to himself when some invisible qualifier has been satisfied, the Nagai sets his rucksack down and crosses his legs beneath himself as he sits. Setting the Harvest across his knees, Sajin resumes a meditative posture, content to wait out the rest of the trip in contemplative silence.

Emily will look at Lanius, and watch him for a moment as he slips into a trance curious what exactly he is doing since the only other time she has seen someone do that she disturbed them very quickly. After a few seconds she turns back to the controls and then she dutifully begins to run scan after scan with the sensors looking for any sign of them getting out of the field, or anyone else approaching the ship. She doesn't seem to be happy that that is all she can do, but since she can't think of any other options she is going to do the best job of it she can.

Yuri could feel the effort Fiolla was putting into it, as he casually lent his strength to her, hoping she wouldn´t notice. He watched how sweat began to show on her face, and it became more and more a mask of determination. He could not see any visible effect on the massive piece of space stone, though through the Force he could feel that she - they - were in fact affecting it. Unfortunately it was on too small a scale to have any real impact on their current situation.
With his attention not so fully occupied, Yuri didn´t flinch quite as bad when rem came running and yelling. He just thanked the Force Drem hadn´t been communication through his comlink, as getting that amount of decibels directly into his ear would most likely have made hi deaf. On pure instinct, he threw himself over the controls, firing the thrusters at maximum to try and break off their coming date with the asteroid.

It seems like forever to the young girl, but suddenly the Jedi sits up straighter, his arms getting to work as his hands fly over the controls, turning the ship around to head back into the asteroid field. "**I know where they are!**" he says, his lips thinned as he concentrates dodging one asteroid and then another.
Retracing his path, a small blip, which Emily quickly identifies as being the missing transport, registers on the sensors.
"**Get the others and have them get the hatch ready,**" Lanius directs her.

Yuri and Drem fight the newly activated thrusters, praying that the trajectory is enough to avoid collision with the massive asteroid in their path. The occupants in the cabin are holding their breath as the engines strain against the sudden vector change.
Meter by meter the ship angles upwards as it gets ever closer to the collision. There's an echoing scrapping sound through out the ship as the bottom hull impacts the rock. Alarms blare as signs of critical hull damage light the board.

Sajin sits in meditation, allowing his passive connection to the Force to pervade his being, healing wounds and easing his mind. The Nagai reflects on the mission, and more specifically his actions during and ways he could have improved the outcome, and what he finds in his introspection causes him to mentally berate himself.
He had allowed his anger and his pride to get the better of him and it had caused him to stray to close to the darkside. The Jedi Shadow knew this to be a dangerous prospect in his line of work, with many of the darkside artifacts and locales that he had infiltrated could feed off his inner turmoil, strengthening their influence and putting his well-being at risk. With the fate of billions resting under his arm, he had dipped into his rage, into his love of conflict, and it had almost cost them all dearly.
*Stillness. A Jedi must first learn to hold his blade in perfect silence, before he may hold it in conflict.*
At times, Sajin missed his old Draethos master. Or rather, missed who he once was, before the Nagai left the Jedi Order and was recruited into the Covenant by Master Nondo. There was another that he missed, memories of her beginning to resurface unbidden, but the Shadow is quick to tamp them down to regain his inner calm.

Emily nods at Lanius when he tell her to notify the others about the ship, and says in a bright and almost chirpy voice **"I will."**, definitely in a better mood then she was after talking with Sajin earlier, before darting out of her chair and heading toward the back of the ship looking for the others. When she finds Ka'ra she will say to her, **"We've found the others, do you know where Sajin is we need to get the hatch ready for them?"** and once she has her answer she will continue her search of the ship for him.
Once she locates Sajin, she intends to disturb his mediation quite throughly saying, loudly and in a mischievous tone **"Are you in there?"** to him when she finds him, and whether he opens his eyes or not will continue with, **"We've found the others, I need your help to get the hatch ready for them."**

Yuri quickly discovers that there isn't much time before the cargo section and engineering compartments are exposed to the vacuum of space. Thankfully the ship was divided into three airtight compartments - the cockpit, living area and cargo hold.
Drem notices as he attempts to stay clear of any more impacts, that the sensors are registering another bogey - the freighter. The comm panel subsequently lights up with an incoming transmission for the Dynamic-class light freighter. "***This … Lanius, stand …. docking.***" The message comes through garbled, but it quickly becomes obvious of what his intent is as he harpoons the disoriented transport to bring it in for easier docking.
Unfortunately the airlock he's utilizing is in the quickly venting section of the ship.<div style="text-align: center;">

Lanius eases the freighter through the decimated asteroid belt with great determination. Narrowly missing colliding with several of the larger pieces by a hands breadth. Ka'ra, startled into wakefulness by her young companion, obligingly puts on her helmet once more and meets Sajin and Emily at the airlock. Over the loudspeaker Lanius's voice rings out, "**Get ready. Once we're docked we won't have much time to get everyone off.**" The speaker cuts off as there's a loud thud and the three of you are nearly knocked off your feet from the impact.

Emily looks at Sajin when he teased her, at first her eyes narrowing with irritation but then when she realises that he is teasing her she laughs with genuine amusement and says, **"I guess you aren't so stuffy after all."** before she turns to head off to the hatch saying over her shoulder to him, **"Try and keep up old man."** with a mischievous expression on her face, before she breaks into a run down the corridor heading toward the hatch.

**"You know, escape pods would be really nice now, and you´d expect to find some aboard this thing"**
While talking, Yuri looked for something on the control panel that would hint to the presence of escape pods. Preferably, he thought, ones that were accessible from a section of the ship that was not getting turned into vacuum. He sincerely hoped that there were available ones, since he didn´t fancy taking a walk through deep space. He knew he could sustain himself on the air in his lungs for a long time, though if they didn´t find any space suits, they´d be completely without protection against the crushing force of the outside space.
While working, he slammed the comm button, trying to hail the other ship.
**"Stop blowing holes in our ship! We´ve got enough of those, thank you very much"**

Once the reach the fateful airlock, Sajin checks a nearby emergency supply station, securing a vaccuum mask for himself. As the the atmospheric seal is formed between their ship and the shuttle, the Nagai takes his lightsaber in hand, not knowing if he will need to cut his way through any obstacles once on the other side. Looking down at Emily, he slips the mask over his face, tapping it to indicate its presence to the young woman.
**"You may wish to find one of these for yourself, unless you are member of some rare, lung-less species of humanoid of which I am unaware. Judging by the degree with which you talk, huff, and sigh, I do not think this the case."**

Emily mock glares at Sajin when he throws out the insult and then huffs in a louder then usual fashion and turns away, a smile growing on her face once she is sure he can't see it and she quickly heads to the emergency supply station that Sajin used and collects a vaccum mask for herself, securing it over her face and she heads back to the airlock to provide whatever assistance she can.

While the pressure beyond the airlock doors continues to decrease as the cargo hold is vented, Kara, Emily and Sajin prepare to head through in their attempt to rescue the others. As Emily is about to head through into the airlock, Kara pulls her back with a shake of her helmet. "**Stay here, adi'ka.**" Not leaving the girl to argue and expecting to be obeyed. she heads into the airlock with Sajin.
"**I checked the damage report the scanners picked up while I was waiting. They have hull breaches along the keel, but the upper compartments should still be airtight,**" Ka'ra speaker amplified voice states, the doors to the airlock closing behind them and the pressure adjusting to equalize to the other side. "**Hopefully the others are waiting for their chance to make a break for this ship, so all we have to do is usher them over here.**"
********************************************
While Yuri and Drem discuss their options on how to get to the other ship, Fiolla reaches over into the emergency stores pulling out several vacuum masks, handing each of them one. "**If you two are done squabbling I say its time to get out of here.**" She puts it on as she walks into the living section, waiting for the others before she opens it up to head into the depressurizing cargo hold. Kin is no where in sight as Drem and Yuir follow Fiolla's lead.
The door to the cargo hold opens and the sudden change nearly sweeps the three off their feet into the cargo hold. Fiolla having been holding onto the door frame manages to stay upright, but the two men waiting father back are pushed forward as the self contained atmosphere of the cockpit and living quarters escape in a rush.
Putting one steady foot in front of the other, the three make it halfway through the cargo hold before Yuri is stopped. To the side he notices Kin surrounded by some turned over crates. Fiolla spotting the Nautolan too, makes her way over to him, vacuum mask in hand. "**He's unconscious,**" she yells, tightening the mask over his head and turning it on. Taking a hold of their comrade on either side, Yuri and Drem continue heading toward the airlock just as Ka'ra and Sajin step out.
Ushering them in Ka'ra remains outside of the airlock. "**Go ahead in, I have something to take care of,**" she says by way of explanation, and forces the issue by shutting the airlock hatch behind them. Now pressurizing, oxygen levels return to normal in the airlock and after a few minutes the console reads green to enter the freighter. Emily is quick to open the hatch, eager to be a participant in the rescue.

Drem turned to help Ka'ra, but was quickly cut off by the closed hatch. **"HEY!"** he yelled, turning to the others. **"What the nass is she doing? She's going to get herself killed,"** he said. **"That ship's about two parsecs from becoming a permanent fixture on one of those asteroids … "** Looking to Emily, he asked, **"Any ideas?"** The scout hoped that they could put the field behind them and summon the *Valiant* soon. Not that he minded the small ship, but rather the immediate dangers from around them caused his neck hairs to raise. It was only a matter of time before someone else that had escaped came looking for them ... or worse, scavengers looking to loot the field ...

Leaning down the unconscious Nautolan towards the inside of the ship hull next to the airlock, Yuri took a deep breath. He held out his hand towards Drem as the scout turned towards the hatch.
**"She can take care of herself. We should prepare to get out of here as fast as possible"**
Getting up from Kin, he pulled off his mask and stuck it inside his belt. He was pretty sure most of the air in it was spent, but he still felt it could be good to keep on to it, since they weren´t out of deep space trouble yet. He looked down at the Nautolan and figured they should better try to get him some medical attention. Fiolla had managed to get a mask on him, though he had been unconscious when they found him.

Sajin helps in securing the stranded crewmembers, as well as their unconscious Nautolan comrade, before the ajoining shuttle completely loses pressurization. When everyone is secure, he mvoes to activate the freighter's internal comm channel, but is preempted by Ka'ra's hasty departure over to the doomed shuttle. With a shake of his head, the Jedi flips the internal comm unit to the cockpit.
**"Lanius, this is Sajin. Your Mandalorian companion has run over to the shuttle, and the airlock has sealed. She has not communicated her intentions, has she spoken with you?"**
With a moment's thought, Sajin shifts the selector on his own commlink over to Ka'ra's signal, listening for any clue as to what the young woman may be about.

### **Darren** (2010-09-10 04:33:04)

Emily has no intention waiting for a communication from Lanius as to Ka'ra's intentions before she acts, knowing exactly what she wants to do heading into the airlock with the intention of following after Ka'ra even as she knows why she would be running into a dying ship, saying to Drem when he asks if she has any ideas, **"We rescue them obviously."** without even breaking stride as she heads into the airlock completely disregarding Ka'ra's instructions to remain on the ship that isn't suffering a major oxygen leak.

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

Stricken a bit dumbfounded by Emily's blunt response, Drem looks to Yuri and said, **"Kid's got a point. Tell them to keep it afloat … we'll be right back."** Checking his oxygen supply, the scout took off after Emily, heading into the airlock and into the other ship. Yelling ahead to her, he asks, **"Any idea where she went? Or better yet, what she needed?"** Deep down he knew they had to act fast, the ship didn't have much time and he was pretty sure they had even less ...

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-09-10 14:30:39)

Relaxing back in the transport, and bent on not going back into the broken ship, Yuri called out towards Emily and Drem.
**"Hey, just think for a minute. That woman practically lives in a space suit, and quite probably don´t plan on being in there for very long. What can you two - who barely even has an oxygen supply - do other than get in the way?"**

As Emily and Drem attempt to follow Ka'ra back through into the decompressing cargo bay of the transport, they find that she has managed to lock the door so they can't do just that. Not that anyone manage to follow her with the state of their masks. Aside from Emily's vacuum mask, the others discover that their masks are now depleted of the oxygen stores, their run to the full life supported Dynamic freighter having used up the reserves.
Over the comm Lanius replies to Sajin, "Yes, she's been in contact. She's going to attempt to navigate it out for retrieval, or at the very least avoid the asteroids till the Valiant can get to her." He pauses as he goes through the process of undocking from the transport, the outer hatch of the airlock locking. "We'll meet back up with her then."
As Sajin flips his commlonk to Ka'ra's frequency, he finds it silent for a long moment and then her voice echoes over the channel, "I've reached the cockpit, it's pressurizing now with the hatch closed." There's a long pause before she adds, "The engines have enough thrust for me to get it out. Meet you in the black."
Before anyone can protest, Lanius disengages from the transport, setting a trajectory out of the field and out of the danger of the large, perilous asteroids. Once clear, he keeps a distance from the field but seems to be waiting for signs of the transport making it out. In the cockpit, proximity alarms go off as a large cruiser drops out of hyperspace nearby, the transponder code quickly identifying it as the *Titan's Valiant*. The comm panel flares to life as the freighter receives a communique from the frigate. After an exchange of words, Lanius veers the freighter toward the docking bay.

Brushing himself off and making sure Kin would be ok for the moment, Yuri took a walk towards the cockpit of the freighter. He found his way pretty quickly, and he felt familiar aboard the *Dynamic*-class ship. Solid freighters, he had found himself aboard them more than once before. As he reached the cockpit he stopped in the doorway, staring out at deep space and the cruiser ahead. He guessed that with his poncho hanging around him, his distant look, and his tall stance, he had to look quite a bit like a jedi. Without turning his eyes toward Lanuis, he spoke to them man.
**"So, I guess the rumors of your death was exaggerated. And now you´ve returned to help piece together what is left of the Galaxy, eh? I have to say I was surprised to see you back there"**

Sajin closes both the ship's internal comm channel and then his own personal commlink as his suspicions are confirmed. He frowns in exasperation at both Emily and Drem, and with a shake of his head he turns to look around for something else to pursue.
With the situation well in hand, the Nagai turns to help lift the unconscious Nautolan and then take him to what passes for an infirmary on the freighter, securing Kin to the sole med-bed and performing the very limited first aid that he knows in an attempt to at least keep the scout stabilized. Once that is taken care of, he merely perches on the sole stool in the infirmary, watching over the Nautolan until they have docked with the valiant.

Emily looks at the locked airlock door with clear frustration at not being able to help Ka'ra and turns away from it, stomping off back toward the cockpit just in case Lanius needs any help piloting the ship, clearly not happy with the situation but there is no way that she can get passed the door lock before Ka'ra would have detached the ship.

**"It's probably for the best,"** Drem said to Emily. **"I know you're capable and all, but that ship doesn't need a ton of people in it right now, not to mention that Yuri was probably right. Ka'ra does seem to be pretty competent in that armor of her's."** Moving towards the common area, the scout took a seat and slumped his head back. Exhaling a relieved sigh, he was glad to be aboard a ship that wasn't colliding with any asteroids or about to explode. His mind wandered a bit as he sat there, thinking about his uncle and the adventures they shared. Drem considered what his uncle would've done in the situation he was in. *Probably laugh a bit and fly through the darmin field,* he thought. Shaking his head as he sat forward, he pushed away his doubt and the stress of the day and looked around the ship he was in. It didn't take long for curiosity to take hold of him and, as quickly as he sat, he stood back up and started poking around to see what else was here ...

Lanius spares a glance to look back at Yuri as the *Titan's Valiant* locks on with their tractor beam and brings the frieghter in the rest of the way. "**It has been a long time, Yuri,**" he says in response. "**It was suprisingly easy to disappear when the ship you were last known to be on was destroyed.**" He turns back toward the viewport to take in the sight of the Hammerhead-class cruiser, growing quiet as the young teen stomped into the cockpit, taking a seat at the copilot seat.
Sparing the girl a small smile as she essentially huffs her indignation, he resists the urge to shake his head at her antics. "**Ka'ra didn't leave you behind to spite you, young one. If you had gone with her, there's a possibility you wouldn't be alive to complain.**"
The freighter, pulled into the *Valiant*'s bay by the tractor beams, is settled on an empty platform. The bay is unusually busy as a few of their standard Minstrel shuttles prepare to take off. Off to the side you can see a Citadel-cruiser with an attatched custom figter of some sort. Emily recognizes the cruiser and fighter as belonging to Ka'ra, and the former being piloted by Tanith Hogra, who she'd have met in passing on Telia V.
***********************************
Sajin finds that the medbay has been integrated into the lounge area. The medbed is a fold out affair agains one wall. There's a small cabinet marked medical supplies where you find a small stock of medpacs in a medical kit. Fiolla comes to assist you in helping the still unconcious Nautolan and together manage to stabalize him.
Still in the lounge are the two scientists, who up until Sajin entered had been muttering to each other. They look at the newcomers and increasingly become alarmed as they recognize them from the suspicious transport. The shock registers quickly on their expressions and they start to sputter their indignation before their gaze goes to Sajin. And is further interrupted by an audible thump as the frieghter lands on something.

Shifting himself a bit to let Emily into the cockpit, Yuri kept his gaze out into deep space. He wondered what would come to pass now. Normally, he would just drift away, satisfied with a well completed job, but he had a feeling this time was different. He suspected that he would not be dismissed as usual, and in fact he would probably insist to hang around even if they tried to get rid of him. He felt like it was the right thing to do. Besides, it seemed too odd a coincidence that he would have crossed path with no less than two former members of the Jedi Order during this mission. Perhaps the time to hide was over, and the time to act had come?
**"If you have time later, it has been some time since I sparred with anyone. Pirates, Slavers and other scum don´t count"**
Turning around, he decided to find a few moments of relaxation before they got off the ship.

With Kin stabilized, Sajin smiles appreciatively at Fiolla, and then leaves the Nautolan in the woman's more tender ministrations. As he turns away from the make-shift medical facility, he deftly moves along with the ship as it roughly parks in the docking bay of the massive cruiser. Quickly, the Jedi strides back into the cargo bay he had appropriated for himself, and gathers up all of his equipment, and then returns to the lounge in search of pair of scientists.
**"Ahh… I have a confession to make, my very good friends: I have deceived you. We, in fact, do not work for mister Jut-Hakk, neither were we taking you to a safe rendezvous."**
The Nagai then offers the two scientists an apologetic smile, but it is rather evident that the embarassment is feigned. He then claps his hands together once, and his smile brightens as he prepares to offer the scientists their cheerful alternative.
**"But! I have not been all untruthful: There will be a great many questions, but instead of your erstwhile Master, these questions will be asked by the much more pleasant officers of Republic Intelligence. Now, stand-to and I will lead you to your new *accoutrements*, and I simply won't take no for an answer!"**
Although Sajin's smile is bright, his stare is deadpan and unsettling, and when the pair of scientists do stand, he herds them out of the small freighter and towards a proper detainment unit, the boxed Force Harvest still protectively cradled under his arm, and his rucksack slung over one shoulder.

*Two weeks,* Tanith thinks as he finishes his routine maintenance on the *Atin*, *two weeks of Jedi and enemy soldiers on a damned dry base. No women, no booze, nothing. Now I'm on this damned Republic cruiser, new model, damned nice ship. I hate it. Don't know the people, doesn't feel like home without a uniform that I left for a reason. I must be dead and in hell. Have to be.*
The alarms' blaring makes him jump from the ship quickly realizing he doesn't know the ship layout and can't find the fighter bays, reminding him again that he doesn't belong on this ship. He packs away his tools and goes out to the hanger floor waiting for the incoming ships, willing to bet they would contain his erstwhile 'employers,' and analyzing the efficiency of the new generation of Republic Navy as they go about their duties.
As Lainus's ship sets down he makes his way over to the boarding ramp and waits. The sight greeting anyone leaving the ship would be of a man roughly 1.6 meters tall, in armor that looks like it's seen too many engagements but has been kept in good repair. He's built like a pilot, short and compact, with heavy muscles for such a wiry frame. Twin worn and scarred belts hang from his sharp, narrow hips holding a pair of pistols low on his thighs. One pistol is older, as hard beaten and well maintained as the armor, the other a newer, large slugthrower. Any looks for eye contact are met by the cold advanced goggles of his helmet, one of the few solid pieces of the supple helmet. His stance is typical of fighter pilots everywhere: cocky, lazy confidence with a healthy dose of not being impressed. His arms are crossed, no easy feat considering the bulk of his gauntlets, and his shoulders cocked askew to his hips. He seems almost to be leaning against something, even though there is nothing near by.

Feeling the ship land, Drem wandered to the gangplank. **"Mmm … food,"** he muttered, thinking of the galley on the larger ship. As the gangplank lowered, the scout stretched as he wandered down into the hanger, a steady stream of cracks and pops emitting from his back and shoulders. Looking to the armored gentleman at the base of the ramp, Drem smiled with a greeting. **"Jettoz … Bazi batza Bazic?"** Receiving nothing but the cold stare of the man's goggles, he cocks a brow and pulls out a Bantha Stick, snapping it in half and offering half to the armored individual. **"Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-ninny-bong?"** Drem says with a smile, one hand extended with half the stick, the other moving to take a bit out of the other half.

Emily smiles a short small smile at Lanius and says from her position in the co-pilots seat **"I know, but that doesn't mean I have to like it."** before shaking off the remnants of her sour mood and smiling more honestly as she helps with the landing. Once they are in the bay and she gets a look at Ka'ra's ships, she smiles at Lanius and says, **"I think I'll wait for Ka'ra in her ship, I expect she is going to be a little upset when she works out that I tried to go after her."** waiting for his response, before standing up and making her way out of the shuttle and toward Ka'ra's cruiser where she is going to wait for Ka'ra to return and the nearly inevitable yelling that is going to occur after that.

Tanith stands more than a bit bewildered at the sights leaving the ship. *A REALLY pale fella and two desk jockeys, some scruffy barv speaking gibberish and threatening me with a Bantha Jym stick, and a kid. What the hell?* he thinks looking around for a second to be sure the man was speaking to him.
**"Ya know, that sounds nothing like Shyrriwook, and aren't ya supposed to growl more and flex,"** he says as he mimics the large Wookie gladiator's pose from the Bantha Jym advertisements, **"when you do that? Aren't ya supposed to bite it in half, eh? Instead of breaking it?"** he asks, confused and determined to make light of the situation.

Lanius glances behind him to Yuri, allowing Emily to take control of the freighter. "**I'll see what can be arranged**," he says with a sly, small smile as he watches him turn around and leave for else where on the ship.
With the ship securely docked in the landing bay, he takes over the power down sequences as Emily gets ready to bound out of the cockpit. "**Might not be a bad idea, young one.** " On the way out she passes Tanith, a familiar sight, as he waits at the bottom of the ramp, Drem offering him a bantha stick.
The way to the *Atin Oya'ka* is otherwise clear of obstacles and no one on the hanger deck stops her from making her way to the Citadel-class cruiser and the fighter. As usual the ramp is closed, but that's hardly a problem for Emily knowing the access code to get in.
The scientists look at the Nagai Jedi in abject horror as they realize the magnitude of the dilemma they've found themselves. They're slow to respond, the reality of it not quite having settled. It's their shock which keeps them quiet as Sajin urges them to stand and to move out of the freighter and into the hanger bay of the Hammerhead-class cruiser. A pair of security guards, smart in their navy uniforms with a blaster pistol and stun club visable on their hips, waylay Sajin as he crosses the bay. "**We have orders to take these two into custody. We'll take them from here,**" one says and motions for the two scientists to follow them. The two scientists look between each other, but not seeing much of a choice do as they're told.
The hanger bay itself is full of activity. Techs and other deck crew move about in an orderly fashion as the last of the small transports leaves the hanger and. A few of the techs come to take a look over the Dynamic-class freighter of Lanius's. They nod in passing to any of its passengers but otherwise keep to themselves as they get to work. So far there's no sign of the transport Ka'ra boarded.
Lanius is the last to disembark, having taken care of locking down the freighter for its temporary storage in the *Titan's Valiant*'s hanger bay. Spotting Tanith he gives him a nod in greeting. He proceeds to step down off of the loading ramp, each step bringing him level to the pilot. "**Mr. Hoagra, glad you could join us.**" His tone is civil, but there is a crease of a frown in his forehead as he looks around the hanger bay.

Yuri barely registers the presences of the techs and other people that comes and goes as he slips deeper into his meditation. He has found a relatively quiet space aboard the freighter, in the starboard dormitory of the ship. He breaks out of his trance though, as new presences begins to flood the ship, and he figures it best to disembark and let them do whatever they are about to do.
Walking down the ramp, he spots several familiar faces, and he spots Drem engaged in conversation with an armored individual. With the focus of the discussion apparently being a Bantha Stick, he decides to leave them to it. Upon taking a look around the hangar, he does notice one face that he would have expected to be there as missing. Finding himself a relatively quiet place, he settles down on a small cargo crate and expands his awareness outwards, beyond the ship. Hoping that she is just running a little late, he searches for Ka'ra´s mind, seeking some reassurance that she is alright.
*"You alright?"*

Tanith turns from the Bantha stick wielding assailant as Lanius approaches. **"Oh aye, took some doing to fit this into my schedule. Busy, busy, eh? Where's the lass?"** he asks, having seen a motley and varied crew unload but no sign of Ka'ra. His tone is light, but his question isn't. **"I take it the operation was a success? Ole coughing Hut is short one super power pack, eh?"**
*Where the hells is the lass?* he wonders. Not wanting to jump to conclusions he still runs a mental pre-flight on the *Atin*, confident he could be in the void in less than 10 minutes if need be. *By the Force, I sound like a teenager,* he thinks as he turns to look out the hanger bay doors at the asteroid field. **"I see ya have jerky, unintelligible friend, but do you have any liquor? And sure, you can act out whatever Holo-commercial you like when you present it, eh? Please tell me you can do Captain Doordan's Devaronian Spiced Rum, eh?"** he asks of the bantha stick brochure person.

*Unintelligible?* Drem thought, his face twisted into that of insult. **"I'll have you know that I graduated within the top ten of my class,"** he stated in a very matter-of-fact way. **"And, in addition, I believe the proper greeting from an *intelligent* species would've been 'Hello' or perhaps 'Ahoy'. Standing the way you were and glowering all over the bay is hardly a decent greeting."** Rescinding the peace offering to snack upon himself, the scout continued on his rant. **"In addition, anyone traveling Outer Rim territories would easily know that 'Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-ninny-bong' is the universal greeting, used by many explorers and scouts in times of first contact. As for your question on Shyrriwook, mocking the noble Wookie would do nothing more than upset them … and you don't want to see an upset Wookie.

Though I look nothing like that barhop … what's his name … Essik? He's easily a foot taller than I am."** Taking a bite out of the other half of the bantha stick, Drem continued. **"Oh … and why would someone eat off a stick that someone bit off? I mean, eww … really? Talk about unhygienic. What if they had a disease or some kind of virus? You really need to study your intergalactic scouting and protocol a bit more. Might I suggest *Ferrod's Guide to Intergalactic Cultures and First Contact Situations*? It's a great read and so much more interactive than past guides …"**

Sitting alone in his quarters meditating, Tendau suddenly pops to his feet as a familiar pressence is felt. *Lanius is back, hopefully this most recent threat has been dealt with.*
Quickly gathering his cloak the Jedi hurries down the corridors towards the dockingbay. Passing a few crew members he recognizes as he enters the bay he nods in greeting and continues on his way towards where he sees Tanith conversing with some human.
As he approaches you can see he is a young ithorian, obviously not too long out from under his masters robes. He strides down across the bay with brown robes swaying as he walks with purpose towards the disembarking crew. As he draws nearer, those who couldn't tell before see a lightsaber hanging on the lefthamd side of his belt, visible when he raises his arm in greeting to Tanith and the newly arrived Lanius.  **Greetings Tanith** the ithorian says smiling with both mouthes. Bowing in conjunction with his greeting for Lanius he also states  **Greetings Master Lanius, I trust everything went according to plan?**  Tendau finishes his inquiry waiting for Lanius to either introduce him to the rest of the crew or to answer and move the conversation to a more secured location.

Emily makes her way up to the bridge section of the cruiser flicking on it's sensors to look out into the deep black of space for any trace of Ka'ra and the transport that she got into, getting increasingly worried as time passes. Intending on staying there until she falls asleep from exhaustion or Ka'ra returns which is seemingly increasing less likely as time passes.

**"Aye, aye! Peace! If I were an explorer or scout I might give a damn about 'first contact' greetings, but as it is, shaking jerky at a man isn't exactly cordial, eh? Besides, Bantha Jym sticks taste like Hut swill… Yes, yes I know Wookies shouldn't be laughed at save from long distances, saw several make Mando armor look like cheap flimsy-plast wrapping during the war… No, the problem is I haven't had a drink in damn near a month, that's enough to make anyone a bit grumpy now isn't it?… Essik? *Starship Valentine*? Never seen it. Doesn't sound that interesting either,"** Tanith gives up and lets the man rant on for a bit about some gibberish to do with hygiene and a book.
*Oh aye, and I suppose you take food from complete strangers, eh? Heh!* he thinks but doesn't say, not wanting to get the fellow riled again. As Tendau approaches and greets him he waves back, then turns to the upset man who's so concerned with etiquette, **"Here here, peace! I am Tanith Hoagra, and this Ithorian here is called Tendau,"** he says, indicating the tall willowy being and offering the jerky-obsessed man his hand, **"And besides, deal with these people long enough and you'll want a drink too. What's your handle?"**

Sajin waves a sad farewell to the scientists as they are taken into Republic custody, although the melancholy does not last long as he looks around the bustling hangar. Catching sight of an available comm terminal, the Nagai strides over to it, takes a look around to make sure he is not being watched, and then runs a data link from his comm unit into the terminal. Turning the commlink to a specialized encrypted channel, their is no visual on the comm terminal, and the communication is for the Jedi's ears only.
**"Report."
"The package is secure, although the *target*,"** In this Sajin refers to Jut-Hakk, although the voice on the other end does not interrupt him, **"is likely still at large, although his operation has been destroyed. I have made contact with Lanius and am now in Republic hands, requesting further orders."**
While Sajin's message is encoded and transmitted, he glances over his shoulder at the crowd slowly growing around Lanius, his interest piqued although he awaits confirmation of his orders before moving on.

**"'Handle'?"** Drem questioned, having just finished his tirade. **"Oh, my name, right."** He tried to chuckle off the obvious obliviousness of his question and, seeing as it failed, he quickly interjected. **"Dremmin Kol, jack of all trades and master of at least one."** He offered his hand to the armored man, nodding to the Ithorian in greeting. **"Sorry if I got carried away … I don't take kindly to strangers questioning my abilities. So, uh … part of the crew?"** It was pretty apparent that, although Drem was a jack of all trades, conversation wasn't one of them ...

Lanius looks around distracted as Tanith and Drem rant at each other, his attention going elsewhere. "**She's still out there on the transport,**" he explains slowly, his attention drawn back to those around him as everyone gathers at the bottom of the ramp. " As the young Ithorian Jedi approaches he gives him a nod in greeting. "**It was indeed a sucess, more so than I had hoped. Jut-hakk's plans have been thwarted.**" *For the time being* seemed to be left unsaid as he looks at each of you. "**We'll be discussing later what will come next. Take your well earned rest. I'm sure quarters have been arranged for your use here. If you'd excuse me. There's matter I must attend to.**" With that he takes his leave, heading toward Sajin, the shirt wrapped box the Force Harvester resided in clutched securly under his arm.
There's a long pause over Sajin's hacked communication channel as the beings on the other side dileberated the next step. "**Ensure the Force Harvester's safety,**" the voice booms, neither male nor female. "**The Dark Reaper must not be allowed to be resurrected or the Harvester itself used. Stay with Lanius, if he should prove to be untrustworthy take control of the situation.**" The channel remains open as the beings wait for any questions from their shadow. However, Sajin is interrupted as Lanius makes his approach. The young man stops short of the Nagai, the weariness and concern cascading off him for just a moment as he takes another look around the bay, but then he seems to bar the current and it stops. "**The captain should have made preperations to contain the Harvester till another solution can be found,**" he starts, his attention going from Sajin to the box under his arm as he speaks.
On the Atn Oya'ka, Emily does all she can to extend the range of the ship's sensors, but finds she runs into the same problem occuring on Lanius's freighter. Unable to puncture the distortion field around the field she can only pick up the ships entering and leaving. The ships sent by the Titan's Valiant enter the field in different places as half seem to begin converging toward where Emily recongnizes to be Ka'ra's last coordinates, while the other half seem to be drawn elsewhere.

**"Well met Dremmin. Well met,"** the greeting dies off as Lanius wanders away, Tanith's goggled eyes following him closely. *Bastard doesn't seem overly concerned about the lass. Hmmmm…* he thinks.
**"Part of the crew? Aye, I guess you could say that. What one trade are you a master of Kol? And what transport was Lanius talking about, eh? Where the lass is?"** he asks, distracted and returning to staring out into space. *Wonder if the Atin's coms can pierce that particular patch of ugly out there…*

Finishing off the rest of the bantha stick, the scout said, **"Hm? Oh, I guess exploration and general knowledge of the deep frontier."** Though he seemed a bit flighty, Drem was rather sharp when his luck was with him. Seeing that Tanith's attention wasn't completely on the discussion, he asked, **"I'm presuming by the armor that you're a 'front-liner'? One of Ka'ra's men, perhaps?"** As he finished his question, a sound not unlike a voorpak mewling emitted from his stomach. While the beef sticks were a quick fix, it didn't take a genius to tell Drem was hungry ...

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **jwol** (2010-09-20 14:40:01)

Smiling at Drem as he continues to unwittingly provoke Tanith, the ithorian interjects,  **Mr. Hoagra here is one of the best pilots I've ever seen friend. He's survived encounters not even some of my brethren did, and he's quite handy in a pinch. As for being one of Ka'ra's men we were enlisted as a fail safe should something have happened to the expedition you just finished.** Shifting about it is aparent that the explanation given was meant to forstall any other hostile comments between the two humans. As the Jedi stands there serenly waiting to move on to a more secured location to discuss the next move of the unlikely group of heroes, the aura of serenity eminating from Tendau is almost palpable and the Jedi hopes the others will follow his example and calm down their edgy nerves.

**"Bah, ignore Tendau, he's a bit charitable as you can see,"** he says after Tendau finishes, giving the Ithorian a pat on the arm. **"Some folks survived the wars, I was just one of the lucky few."**
**"Aye, Ka'ra, the wee Mando lass. She brought Tendau and I into this swirling Hut diarrheal fiasco,"** he replies before hearing the standard sound known throughout most of the galaxy that represents hunger. **"Is that your stomach?"** he asks, taking his eyes off the hanger entry, **"Anyroad, as for me, I'm just a worn out spacer. I've seen some ground action too, but I'm best utilized in a ship,"** he continues.
**"Do you know where the lass is? Lanius said something about a transport, and I don't see one besides his. This part of space is a soup of interference, coms won't work, sensors either. Hmmm.

Nodding in response to Tendau with a bit of a smirk. **"Oh, a pilot?"** he said in regards to Tanith. **"We talking fighter jock or a the big spice haulers?"** The tone came off a little insulting it seemed, though from Drem's face it appeared genuine. But before he could apologize, his stomach interjected again. **"Massa pezza goomin, sorry about that, I've been on nothing but rations for a while and could use some real chow,"** the scout said with slightly reddish cheeks. **"You mean Ka'ra? She was bringing in that peeza shizo ship that we were on … I'd imagine she'd be here any minute."** Again his stomach gurgled, almost sounding like an infant Hutt trying to speak. **"Maybe you guys could show me the Galley and we could continue the conversation?"**

**"Of course she´ll be here soon. She´s just struggling with a ship that is barely held together by mesh tape, that´s all"**
Walking past the two people he didn´t know, Yuri stopped next to Drem. He wasn´t entirely sure that was what he had been sensing, though he figured to let it go. Ka'ra had chose to go away on her own, and she wouldn´t have gone off unless she thought she could handle it. And if she was in trouble...well, she would have communicated, wouldn´t she? At least a high-pitched emergency signal should have been able to get through that asteroid field. No sense getting worried over what might be nothing.
**"No offense Drem, but you didn´t exactly fix her up to set a record on the Kessel Run"**
The bald ex-Jedi looked over the two strangers. One of them was armored enough that one might have taken him for a Mandalorian, though the armor seemed too rugged and worn for that to be the case. The other one was an Ithorian, a species Yuri had worked with a few times over the years. For a fleeting moment, his thoughts wandered to Momaw, his Ithorian friend that was working on the Telos Restoration project.
**"So, just who might you two fellows be?"**

**"Thanks Yuri,"** Drem said in reply to the fixing comment. **"Um … this is Tanith and … Tendau, right? They were back up on the mission we just finished."** Again, Drem's stomach gurgled. If listening closely, it made a sound like "Yurgaggleraahh" as the scout put his hand to his mid-section. **"Excuse me,"** he said, his cheeks a bit flush. **"Sooo … The Galley? Anyone?"**

*Snarky wee scruffy…,* Tanith begins to bridle a bit at the insult, then lets it be. *Bah, who cares. After I've saved his life a few dozen times we'll see if he continues that thinking, heh!*
**"Eh, the galley? Tendau can show you Drem, I don't care for it. I'll suffer the food poisoning of my own cooking first,"** he says as he turns back to the hanger doors. **"That galley is like a family reunion you never want to go to. You two enjoy,"** he says. *Nothing like being at home and being looked at like an outsider while hating the fact you're there, eh, Tanith? Heh,* he thinks as he turns and crosses his arms.

Turning to Tanith the Jedi states,  **As for** wiggling his fingers imitating the human,  **Thr force doesn't work like that, if we have not heard from her after I show Drem and if our new friend here would like to join is the galley, I will meditate and see if the force will provide an answer for your query.** Turning back to Drem and the newcomer the ithorian asks,  **Are you ready to head to the galley?**

Yuri nods to the two newcomers as they presents themselves, and shakes his head a bit as Tendau mentions the Jedi Order. *Not another one…why can´t they get it?*
**"Yuri Carkov, bounty hunter and mercenary. And I trust you mean you *were* a part of the Jedi Order my friend, otherwise I have some sad news for you. The Order is no more, crushed by the weight of the Civil War"**
Hearing Drem´s stomach make disturbing noises once again, he laughs a bit.
**"But I guess we could continue this conversation over something to eat. By patching up that bucket enough to get us here alive I´d say Drem has earned a decent meal"**

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **jwol** (2010-09-20 23:28:53)

Grimacing slightly at Yuri's words, Tendau visibly steels himself and continues, all while not allowing his aura of complete calm to crack. **It has indeed been gravely wounded, and those of us remaining are finding turbulent times ahead for us, but no the order is not dead.** Taking a deep breath and exhaling it slowly he continues after a brief pause, **Not yet atleast, not as long as there is even one who believes and follows the code, we are but embers, but embers can ignite a blaze of hope. Who knows my friend, maybe one day we'll walk the halls of the great temple and I can show you the beauty of the room of a thousand fountains.** Thinking back to those wondrous halls the jedi reminisces, *and what a wonderful day that will be to walk those halls hearing children laugh as they learn the ways of the force.*
Looking back to the human Drem and his loudly growling stomach the ithorian comments, **But we've made Drem wait long enough for his well deserved meal, if you'll follow me this way, I'll lead you to the mess hall.** And with that the Jedi leads the two humans towards the mess.

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-09-21 03:07:14)

**"Doesn´t sound like my thing, but sure"**
In fact, there had been times when Yuri had enjoyed the tranquility of the Room of a Thousand Fountains, but most of his time in the Jedi Temple had been spent in the training grounds. It had mainly been after the war that he had found increased peace of mind in his meditations, and then he found he could do it pretty much anywhere. Still, he was rather glad to hear that Tendau seemed to harbor some hope for the future, but he stood by his conviction that the Jedi Order was gone. It might be reborn some day, but before that time came, there would be no Jedi, *should* be no Jedi, as all such declarations did was to make them targets, make them visible.
Not really intent on philosophical discussions at the moment though, he followed Tendau as he showed them the way towards the mess.
**"By the way, Tendau, you wouldn´t happen to be familiar with the Ithorian herd overseeing the Telos Restoration Project, would you?"**

### **jwol** (2010-09-21 10:15:52)

**Actually I was recently with the herdships at Telos. At the conclusion of the hostilities of the Civil War, I offered my services to help with their priests because of my knowledge not only of the force, but of the sciences of life in general.** Looking back to Yuri as her turns into a door that as you enter obviously is the mess. **I left the safety of the ships because I had heard about disasters befalling places that were openly harboring jedi, and I could not bring any harm to those that were trying to heal the galaxy. I realized that even though my own wish was to help, I could not jeopardize their mission by putting them in harms way because of me. So I moved on, until meeting up with Miss Bralor and Mr. Hoagra and the events that have lead me towards here.** Pointing to an empty table the ithorian strides over and places his cloak upon it before heading up towards the serving stations, gathering a mainly vegetarian meal with a little bit of a steak of an unknown origin and then makes his way back to the table were he settles in for the meal.

Sajin closes the comm channel and disconnects his data cable, allowing it to retract into the hands-free commlink around his throat. The Nagai smiles at Lanius, although mentally he files away the thought that he may have to dispose or replace the man, should he prove a threat to Sajin's mission. He understands full well the other man's weariness and concern, Sajin's own injuries forgotten in the excitement of the moment but returning will full force once his adrenaline had worn away.
**"Very good. Shall we go to meet this captain? I think we would both feel a great deal better with our *gift*,"** Sajin says indicating the bundle with a tapping finger and a knowing smile, **"was secured/"**
The shadow then takes another look around the other Jedi to see who else had joined the circle Lanius had just left, an askant eyebrow quirking as he turns back to the other man. He gestures for Lanius to lead onward, falling into step and speaking companionably as they proceed.
**"Quite the fan club you have growing here. A few Bith bishniquel players, and we'll have ourselves a nice little band."**

---

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Alicia** (2010-09-21 15:28:38)

Lanius nods in agreement a smile quirking at the corner of if lips at Sajin's statement about the band. "**We certainty have gathered a myriad of players, haven't we?**" He asks rhetorically glancing back at the small group consisting of the Ithorian and three Humans as they banter and prepare to head out. With a shake of his head in mild amusement he turns to head toward the exit as well with Sajin in tow.
A buzzing sound indicating the incoming arrival of ships causes him to pause, and he turns to watch letting out a breath of relief he apparently didn't know he had. The others leaving for the mess also stop and turn to watch as the beaten up transport is pulled into the bay. The damage from far away doesn't look as bad as it was, but on closer inspection, dents and scraps on the bottom of the ship are visible in the hull and in some places the plating has been peeled away. There's creaking and popping sounds and more plates fall away as the ship enters the atmosphere and gravity of the bay. Settling on the deck near the Dynamic-class ship, the engines take a few moments to settle off, having been jury-rigged into functioning.
The Knight stands where he is, watching as the ramp finally lowers and Ka'ra steps off, none the worse for wear for her adventure alone in the transport. Spotting Lanius they exchange a nod and wearily with her injured arm held close to her chest she starts heading for the Citadel-class cruiser. Bounding behind her is her the elusive Strill, who had apparently managed to find a bolt hole in the transport. The Strill spotting its favorite playmate leaves the Mandalorian woman's side and bounds over to Tanith, tackling him and nearly knocking him off his feet in the process. Before Tanith can attempt to get a hold of the creature to retaliate in bounds away again, its mouth lulling open in a grin as it prances in a circle before running back to rejoin Ka'ra.
There's a slight bounce to Lanius's steps as he turns to make his way out of the bay once more, his dark robes flowing behind him as he confidently navigates the ship. He leads the Nagain Shadow to a lift accessing the controls to take them to another level, the lift thrumming to life at his behest. As they wait he explains to his companion, "**Ka'ra and Captain Prius made the arrangements for its storage while on board.**" He pauses as he pulls out his datapad, glancing at a set of listed instructions. "**It's to be held in an emptied armory and guarded by a pair of security personnel. No one will be able to access it except Ka'ra, the Captain and myself and it will take two of us to open it once we lock it inside. Their codes have already been programmed in.**" Glancing up from the pad, he sets it aside back into his belt. The lift stops and he takes the first step out glancing around, before setting the steady pace down the corridor.

**"Tentia woa! Umph!… Damned slobber dispenser get off, heh. Off with you, go play. There's one aboard who's more your size, go get her, eh?"** he tells the strill, doing all he can not to laugh too hard at its antics.
He picks up his pace to match Ka'ra's and says, **"Lass, by the looks of the ship you just brought in you forgot what I told you about regular maintenance. Shameful. Youth these days, eh?"** He quips hoping to judge her injuries by her response. **"See? Poorly maintained ships have been known to injure their pilots."**
*I don't believe that thing can fly. That Drem barv did that? His rear will never sully the Atin's control couches, I'll see to it myself,* he thinks as he looks over the transport in amazement. **"Lass, there a reason you got onboard that deathtrap?"** he asks as he follows her to the *Atin*.

Maybe if there was a decent pre-flight rundown of supplies, there wouldn't have been an issue?"** As the scout got more riled, so did his stomach as it let out a nexu-like growl.

Ka'ra pauses at the bottom of the closed ramp, reaching out with her good arm to press in the code to extend it. Turning to speak to Tanith she pipes in wearily, "**The transport's engines got beat up during the escape from the base, and it consequently took some damage as it avoided collision with an asteroid. It was hardly Drem's fault.**" With her helmet still on, it's hard to tell exactly what's playing on her features, though her voice sounds tired and stressed almost past her endurance. "**And it was hardly a deathtrap, obviously since I'm still alive,**" she says wryly, putting her foot on the lowered ramp to head up, inadvertently excusing herself from their company as she heads in.

Tanith looks from the retreating lass to Drem and back, **"Who said it was Drem's fault?"** he says as he hears the scout start whining again.
**"Peace! Do you think every word said is an insult to your honor? By the gods, man, be calm! I hope you're only like this when you haven't eaten. Here, by all means, have a ration pack if it'll help!"** he tells the man, exasperatingly digging out a ration pack and offering it to him.

Sajin watches the wounded shuttle hobble into the docking bay, a slight nod all he gives to the Mandalorian's safe return. He does take note of Lanius's sigh of relief, but the Nagaian holds his peace all the way into and through the elevator car ride. When the other Jedi relays their security setup, Sajin merely smirks.
**"The Harvester's previous owner held it in an empty room, and secured it with a pair of well-armed, and well-trained guardsmen too. Although he had the added measure of two computer-targeted blaster turrets."**
The Covenant operative shakes his head, but his tone is mostly lighthearted even though the subject matter is a bit dark. Sajin nods again as the lift doors opening, striding out of the lift car after Lanius moves first.
**"I would suggest that at least one of the security personnel be trained in detection methods via the Force; I volunteer myself for the duty for the duration of my time onboard. It would also be best if you, the Captain, and Ka'ra quartered in opposing sections of the ship; In case of an infiltration, the the separation between you three would hamper an offending spy, or assassin, and allow more time for an effective response."**
His gaze roves around the corridor's interior as he speaks, his stride lining up with Lanius's as they progress through the Valiant. Sajin speaks from past experience, and although his voice comes out in a dry muse, there's no mistaking the clinical wisdom in his advice.

Yuri follows the Ithorian to the mess. Grabbing a small pack of the spiciest thing he could find, and a small container of something soothing to drink, he takes a seat at the table, awaiting the other getting his meal. Picking small pieces of his food and sipping fom his drink, he felt pretty comfortable having a moment of peace from the recent mission.
**"I don´t think there is anyplace safe for those who dares to call themselves Jedi anymore. Which is why it seems foolish to me to actually claim that title at the moment. Unless you are looking to make yourself a target, or has a death wish, that is"**
He grimaced a bit as he chewed down on a piece of food where the spice had particularly concentrated itself.
**"So, how is it going for them over there? I was hired at the beginning of the project to help them gather some predatory species on Onderon. Nasty business all that, but we pulled through in the end"**

Emily's eyes remained glues to the screens of the Atin, searching for any sign of the missing transport. Her eyes suddenly widen as she notices something on the screen and after checking to make sure it's not just wishful thinking on her part, she checks the distance and waits until it should be within visible range before dashing from the bridge out toward the hanger to wait for the ship to land determined to be the first person through the door once it has to look for Ka'ra, as she heads out she remembers to snag a mask from one of the emergency storage lockers in the Atin just in case there is leaking gases inside the transport, although she doesn't put it on immediately merely holding it in her hand as she moves.

Settling in with his plate of food, the ithorian looks about the table and notices only Yuri. After hearing him talk about the dangers of claiming the title of Jedi and the inquiry about the herdships he says, **Hmm, we seem to have lost Drem on our way here, and wasn't he the one so wishing to visit the mess? Ah well no bother.** With a audible humprh Tendau mulls over what Yuri said to him. **When I was last with the herdships they were doing alright, still running into a minor spat of trouble with the Czerka Corporation but rumor had it that some other jedi had gotten their number and caused them to lose a lot of their licenses. I left though because of the fact that I do claim that title Yuri. I could not bring undue harm to the ithorian people who seek to heal the galaxy, and my presence was well known aboard the ships, so I had to leave. As for the death wish, sometimes it just takes the spark of hope burning brightly in the dark of despair that has followed the wake of these wars. My hope is to draw out the others, so we can rebuild, I have been in contact actually recently with a Jedi Archivist from Coruscant, and I hope to bring him aboard as soon as possible. The Republic needs Jedi friend, and the Jedi need the Republic. It gives us purpose and I intend to do the best I can to fulfill it.**

Looking at the ration pack and then back to Tanith, Drem shook his head in frustration. **"Look … the next time you want say that a ship is 'poorly maintained', try not to say it with the person who gum-shoed the frakking engine back together, Gozza?"** With that, the scout turned and stormed off in search of food and possibly some time alone ... on a ship that wasn't his problem ... at least not right at the moment. As he walked away, the fumes from his mutterings were saying things like "*off all the nerve*", "*tell me how to fix a*" and "*shut up stomach … I'm going! I'm going!*"

Ka'ra leaves the two men to duke it out, or however they wish to resolve their differences. Stepping past the ramp into the cargo bay of the Atin Oya'ka she places a hand on the eagerly awaiting teen's shoulder. "**Su'cuy, adi'ka,**" she says in greeting, moving past the girl to head deeper into the ship. With slow movements she proceeds to take her helmet off as she walks, clipping it to her belt with her one good hand. Her face is drained of color and as she starts to climb the ladder her movements remain slow and she moves with a great deal of difficulty as she attempts not to use her injured arm. Tentia passes by those at the ramp rubbing past Tanith in its progress. As Ka'ra vacates the area around Emily, the strill moves in to give the teen a proper greeting, leaving a slobbery mess on her face.
********************************************
Turning his head to look at the Nagai, a blond brow quirks with amusement as Lanius thinks over his companions ideas. **"Other than finding a nice blackhole or star to drop into, which I don't think is a good idea, I doubt it's possible to secure the blaster thing completely. You're right though that someone capable of Force detection should be added to the security detail.**" With his attention back on the hallway, he makes one turn and then another as he takes them through the ship to the armory. "**Work with Fiolla, Yuri and Tendau to arrange shifts.**" Again he looks at the Shadow, amusement playing in his eye as he adds, "**Unless you expected to do the job entirely on your own?**"
The hallway rounds a corner and as the two Jedi proceed down, two heavily armed guards turn their heads to look at them. Standing at the door, her arms crossed over her crisp naval uniform, is a middle-aged woman her brown hair pulled back into a tight bun. She looks over in the direction the guards do, spotting the two Jedi proceeding toward them. Uncrossing her arms, she puts them behind her back as she attempts to wait patiently for them to reach the door. "**Lanius,**" she says with a nod, at last.
"**Captain**," Lanius responds and then motions towards the Nagai. "**This is Sajin. He has volunteered to add additional security measures.**"
"**Wonderful… Captain Niandra Prius,**" she says, but then turns toward the door. "**Sorry to cut this short, but I have things to do.**" Blocking sight of the keypad she enters a code and then motions for Lanius to come closer. "**Everything's set for you to enter your code. I'll leave you to it. Pleasure meeting you Sajin,**" she adds courteously as she starts to walk away.
Lanius steps toward the panel, putting in his own series of numbers and letters in a blur. The door opens and he waves Sajin into the emptied armory, it's shelves strangely absent of its usual wares.
*********************************
Drem wanders the ship for awhile as he exits the hanger bay. After taking a few wrong turns, one of the crew takes pity on him and gladly gives him directions to the mess hall. Walking into the mess, he spots Yuri and his Ithorian compatriot, Tendau, deep in discussion over their meals.
The mess hall does indeed have a small variety of foods, at least it's only slightly more edible than standard food rations. From all appearances every dish looks alike, if not a different color and texture.

Wandering over to the buffet, Drem takes a tray and a plate and begins building his monument to intergalactic hunger as he wanders from platter to platter, sniffing and sampling the various wares that the Galley has to offer. And, while the tray quickly fills with a noodle with nerf stew dish, a heaping helping of protato wedges, a few slices of spiced grazer loaf, two slices of lean shaak smothered in gravy and a side winterberry jelly. As he approached Tendau and Yuri, he smiled fairly wide as he placed his tray on the table. **"Mind if I join you guys?"** he asked, pulling out two cans of sparkling jumbli juice and quickly sitting down.
Picking up his fork, the scout didn't waste any time digging into the edible monument he created, dashing the occasional spritz of salt, pepper or crushed hevrid peppers on the occasional dish. Looking at both of his table-mated, he flashed another smile, but, being a semi-polite person, continued on with his engorgement, stopping only to crack open a can of juice and swallow half the can in four VERY audible gulps. As he dug back in, he stopped again, a look of mild discomfort on his face. Punching his chest lightly, Drem summoned up what could only be defined as a dewback mating call from his stomach before meekly saying, **"Excuse me …"** With an innocent smile, he then went back to his feast, obviously happy that he finally had some REAL food ...

Sajin smiles slightly at Lanius's jest, although he gives a serious nod when the other man infers that Sajin do the job all by himself.
**"That had been my intention. I trust myself, and you are gaining some *small* measure,"** the Nagai smirks and winks at Lanius before continuing, **"But after our recent little *adventure*, the others still have some work to do."**
As they both round the corner, Sajin begins to slow his footsteps when the Captain comes into view, along with the guardsmen and the fortified entrance leading into the empty armory. The Jedi shadow nods in appreciation of the captain's curt, but direct, nature and stands aside to allow her to pass after she and Lanius opens the door. When Sajin enters the armory, he runs his gaze around it's interior, noting it's every facet and detail and storing the information away for future reference.
**"What is our current destination Lanius? Do you and the Captain intend to place the item under greater fortifications once we arrive?"**

**"Heh! The little slobber monster can follow orders can't it?"** Tanith remarks as he approaches Emily and Tentia. **"Come along wee lass, lets go see to it the lass gets that arm looked at properly, eh?"** he says to Emily as he mounts the ladder, climbing it quickly and following Ka'ra to the *Atin Oya'ka*'s medbay.
**"Lass, let me help with that, eh?"** he says as he ducks around her in the hall to open the door and gesture her inside. **"I don't know much beyond field dressings, but you can talk me through it, eh?"** he states as he removes his helmet and stuffs it through his belt. **"If its half as bad as I think it is judging from your face I'll call Tendau to have look. We also need to discuss our next move. For example, how many bases like the one on Telia V does Jut-hakk have?"** he asks as he moves to help her remove the armor around the most obvious wound.

Shaking his head again while taking another bite of his meal, Yuri didn+t sound very convinced.
**"Whatever gets you though the day. Still, sounds like you´re making yourself an unnecessary target if you ask me. The state of the Galaxy is not something one Jedi can fix. You know, unless Revan suddenly decides to return. If it were me, I´d probably stay low and await the time when the Jedi were able to return in greater strength. *Ba'slan Shev'la*, I think the Mandalorians call it. Strategic disappearance"**
Spotting Drem entering the mess, Yuri was glad to see he finally made his way. He had a feeling the scout could grow quite sour on an empty stomach. Finishing off his snack, Yuri leaned back in his seat and relaxed.

**I understand what you mean Yuri, but I can't change who or what I am.

I thought we lost you my friend.** After acknowledging the newly arrived human the Jedi digs even more into his food devouring the entire plate in quick order and waits patiently for his companions to finish.

Emily lets the strill lick her face, leaving a bit of a mess, saying quietly to her **"I missed you too."**, when Tanith asks her to follow him to Ka'ra while he checks on her arm, she follow dutifully along, seeming to be in a much better mood then she was a few minutes ago.

At first reluctant to accept his help, Ka'ra draws slowly toward the medbay, but finally her tiredness wins out and she grudgingly accepts his help. Taking a seat on the medbay she starts to wearily begin to take off the plates of armor over her injured arm. "**There should be cold packs and a sling in the cabinet**", she says letting out a small hiss of pain as she removes the plates closest to her shoulder. Next she starts to ease of the jumpsuit covering her shoulder, the area swollen with several variations of black and blue covering her shoulder and then down below the top of her tank top. Likely evidence of other wounds she hadn't mentioned yet.
Looking up at Tanith she waylays his concern by saying, "**It's not so bad… was just a dislocated shoulder. Hurt more when it first happened.**" With half of her armored suit underneath laying open with only a tight fighting tank to cover her exposed flesh. She takes the sling first securing her arm in it before putting the cool relief of the cold packs on the swollen and bruised shoulder. "**I'll need some help getting the rest of my armor off… Then I'm going to get some sleep.**"
***********************************
Lanius also looks around the armory chosen for the task, this being the first time he had stepped foot inside. "**For now, we're going to stay on the move till we decide the best way to secure it, or ensure no one will be coming after it for awhile.**" Moving aside some left over crates, a few stacks scattered through out the room being the only remnants of what once was stored here, he opens one and motions Sajin to put the Harvester within, the crate being just big enough to contain it.

**"Fine. I'll help you disrobe, and the wee lass here will keep me honest about it, eh?"** he says with a wink and a grin for both young ladies before helping her with her armor. **"Then I'll give you a nice dose of this painkiller here to put you out for a while so Tendau can do his work. Ah! Shhh,"** he says to her objections, **"I'm no doctor but a busted shoulder doesn't give you bruising all across your body or make your opposite leg stiff now does it? Be still. Don't make me make you have to hurt me, eh?"** he finishes with another roguish grin as he hefts the injector.
**"Don't worry, you'll wake up feeling much better. I'll even cook something. Damned if I know what, but I will. Maybe. Have to ask Tendau how it's done. Hmmmm,"** he says as he frowns in concentration while attempting to use the injector. He lifts his helmet from his belt and triggers his com.
**"Friend Tendau, your skills are needed aboard the *Atin*. The lass is wounded, we have her in the medbay sleeping. Not an emergency mind you, but might want to take care of it before she wakes,eh?"** he says over the com, waiting for a response.
**"Well now, Miss Emily, did you have fun on your adventure?"** Tanith asks the girl as he waits for Tendau and the drug to finish.

Nodding to both of his tablemates, Drem attempted to answer the Ithorian, but failed epically as his half-fed mouth blurted out, **"Eff tharth fahd eroun, Ey can fin eet."** Swallowing what he had in his mouth, he took another healthy swig of the drink, finishing off one can. Luckily, as he was about to belch a second time, he quickly covered his mouth with his arm, firing both the sound and potential stench into it with a muffled MUUUURRMM. Pounding his chest with a fist once again, he meekly looked at the two and said, **"'scuse me … it's nice to have something beyond jerky and rations. So, uhh … what're we talking about?"**

As the ithorian and the two humans sat talking and eating a comlink starts to beep in Tendau's utility belt.  **Excuse me friends I have to grab this.** And with that the Jedi put his earpiece comlink in his ear and recieves Tanith's message.  **It appears Miss Bralor requires a bit of medical attention and my expertise has been requested. If you gentlemen will excuse me, Ill see to our friend.**  Standing up the young Jedi takes his tray back to the proper receptacle and hurries down the corridors to where the  *Atin*  was docked. Making his way into the medbay Tendau asks **What seems to be the symptoms or prognosis so far?**

I tried to give her a dose of painkillers to let her sleep and to let you work on her without her breaking anything,"** Tanith replies. gesturing to the massive bruises across and around Ka'ra's torso and the arm that had begun to swell rapidly once it was out of the armor. **"Prognosis? Hell if I know, but I do know that a busted shoulder doesn't do all this. When ya don't know something, ask someone who does, that's what Momma Lai says and that's why I called you,"** he finishes with a wink and a grin before leaning in the corner of the room, well out of Tendau's way so he can do whatever he needs too.

Sajin quirks an eyebrow at the rather mundane hiding place, but then he shrugs and settles the Force Harvester's case within the crate, unwrapping his shirt from around it. With a nod, he goes back to inspecting the armory's interior as Lanius replaces the lid over the top of the Harvest, and restacks the crates around it.
**"So we become gypsy wanderers harboring one of, if not they most, dangerous item in all the known galaxy."**
The Nagai then turns back to his fellow Jedi, a faint smile tugging at his lips.

Emily watches Tanith work on removing Ka'ra's armour and moves out of the way so the doctor can get to work before she replies to his question and says to him, **"It was very exciting, although there were some rather dull moments every now and then. Luckily they didn't last very long though."** and then she continues with, **"What about you? Managed to keep yourself entertained?"**

Ka'ra assists anyway she can with her good arm and hand as Tanith first works on getting the armor off. Unabashed in the tank and shorts she wears under the sealed suit she stacks the armor neatly to the side out of the way as Tanith goes for the syringe. With talk of putting her out, she stands stock still, her eyes wide in abject fear. "**No…. please don't.**" she seems to beg as she backs away from Tanith toward the far wall and the needle he had loaded with the high dose of painkillers. She doesn't seem to hear anything else that he says, her focus entirely on the object he hefts in his hands.
It isn't a drugged Ka'ra that Tendau finds in the medbay as Tanith expected, the Mandalorian woman refusing to allow her well wishing pilot to get close enough to inject her with the syringe. In fact if he does attempt to force the issue, she becomes rather violent in her obstinance. However, with only one good arm - the other held tight in the sling she put on - and her current state, any fight she may try to put up might be short lived.
************************************************
Lanius takes his time in stacking the other crates around the Harvester, replacing them methodically to match how it was before or to at least look like it hadn't been disturbed recently. "**It will have to do till better arrangements can be made,**" he says. "**It will be harder to find if on the move.**" His task is quickly finished, and he stands straight turning to face the Nagai as he rubs his hands together as if to clean them.
"**If the Force is with us, it won't be a long road.**" He heads for the door, his task in the armory completed, and waits for Sajin to follow him out before he closes the door and checks to make sure it's locked.
"**You may wish to find the others before taking your first shift.**" Not waiting for the Shadow to dispute his advice, Lanius makes his way over to the closest map of the ship's layout. Expertly he opens up himself to the Force as he seeks out the other Force users on the ship, the other's hardly aware of the touch as he manages to locate them. "**Fiolla is in the medbay. Tendau must have made his way back to Ka'ra's ship, the Citadel-class cruiser in the hanger. And Yuri,**" he starts concentrating once more. "**Is in the galley.**" With a small boyish smile he glances at the Nagai, giving him the opportunity to voice more of his opinions before they part ways.

**"Oh. Fun. Perhaps this time we can argue over the number of seconds in a minute, or if 'guarding' the Harvester is as good a plan as 'safeguarding' it."**
Shaking his head, Sajin hitches his gear-ladened rucksack up a little higher on his shoulder while his shoving now-empty hand into a trouser pocket. Although his quip is spoken in good-humor, his smile is wane and he does not look on his next endeavor with much optimism. But as in all things, the Jedi Shadow will do whatever is required to achieve that which is necessary.
**"Fiolla and Yuri I am passingly familiar with, but what of this Tendau? Hopefully he is somewhat more amenable to suggestion. And I take it you will be partaking in a much needed rest, hmm?"**
Sajin begins to walk back towards the lift as he talks, speaking to Lanius over his shoulder as he goes. He had already resolved himself to meet Yuri first in the mess hall, the slight revelation that the man was, in fact, force sensitive being not much of a surprise to the Nagai. When he enters the elevator, he leans against the interior railing, awaiting the other man's entrance before he engages the turbolift.

Seeing the fear in her eyes gives Tanith pause, and he withdraws the offending syringe. **"Didn't mean to upset you lass, just figured it would help you sleep and ease the pain,"** he says as he puts away the apparatus. **"Tendau is on his way, let him look at you."** *Afraid of needles? A Mandalorian?* he thinks, confused as he tries not to think about how the look of fear directed to him had affected him.
In response to Emily he chuckles, **"Well thats good. No, I've been bored to tears for weeks, heh!"** He changes subjects quickly and easily, successfully evading the odd thoughts that were trying to creep into his head.
**"If you need it Tendau I'll help, but I know nothing about medicine. Well, beyond keep it clean and slather it with kolto, eh?"** he tells the Ithorian as he gets comfortable in the corner.

Yuri looks after Tendau as he gets up and leaves. Apparently Ka'ra was back, and it would seem that she had taken quite a beating during her trip. But he figured that´s just what you got when jumping into a rough ride like that, and he supposed she´d had some reason to do it anyway. Turning back to Drem, he chuckled a bit.
**"I was just giving our new Ithorian friend my opinion on openly broadcasting that he is a Jedi to anyone who asks. Making himself a living target if you ask me"**
Finishing his drink, he wiped his mouth dry, and looked around.
**"So, what do you think of our new companions? I didn´t get a chance to chat a lot with that armoed fellow, but Tendau seems decent enough. Hopefully they´ll both function in action as well"**

### **Alicia** (2010-09-27 23:00:52)

Ka'ra calms slightly as Tanith removes the syringe from her sight, but she still stays where she is leaning against the wall as she breaths heavily the fright reaction still over powering her sensibilities. Making no move when Tendau makes his approach, she hardly seems to recognize anyone's presence or what is being said.
******************************
Lanius follows the Nagai into the lift, inserting his destination as the hanger bay, the other direction from the galley, but sets the lift to head in the galley's direction. **"Tendau is an easy going sort, to be sure. You may find him more agreeable than say, Yuri.**" He gives that small grin again as if he's only partly joking. Leaning back against the wall of the lift he seems to relax only slightly. "**Rest will come soon enough. There's still some things to take care of before I find a bunk,**" he says conversationally. "**I suggest you do the same once you have things established with the others. Looks like I'm not the only one to need some 'much needed rest'. Ka'ra has some empty bunks on the *Atin Oya'ka* should you not want to find something on the Valiant.**"

Nodding as he polished off the noodles, Drem said, **"They seem nice enough … though that Tanith guy really needs to learn some manners."** A small, short burp followed, sounding much like an "ERT", which left the scout with an odd look, funny look on his face. **"'Scuse me,"** he said, popping open another can of juice. **"I mean, granted, he didn't realize *who* fixed the ship, but still … That tasted like Yimdarin Pepper … I was standing right there, you know? How would he feel if someone said his piloting had all the skill of a baby bantha? I mean, really …"** Taking a few minutes to taste the beef again, he looked to Yuri, offering some of the meat on a fork. **"Hey, do me a favor and taste this, huh? Do you taste a citrus sort of taste with a bit of heat behind it?"**

---

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-09-28 11:54:26)

**"Don´t worry about it"**
Yuri smiled as he took the extended fork and the accompanying piece of meat on it.
**"You needn´t take it personally. You just wait until we are in need of his skills, and then you snap back. As long as we all do it in the same kindred spirit of friendship, we´ll be fine. You won´t take offense when I tell you that whatever injury Ka'ra has sustained is partially your fault, do you? I mean, you did leave her a ship that could barely fly…"**
Letting the smile turn into a friendly leer, he hoped the scout would understand that the unspoken completion of the sentence should be: *"…but at least you left her a ship. Not everyone would have pulled even that off"*. Letting his smile grow wider, he put the fork in his mouth and tasted the food. He chewed it a couple of times before swallowing.
**"I guess you could be right. Though I just downed a piece of meat drenched in green fire sauce, so for the next few minutes or so my taste receptors will burn like the plains on Eres III. You know, the ones that have burned since the first war"**

Nodding in response, Drem said, **"Yeah, this is true. Hope she's okay."** Thinking for a moment, the scout hoped it wasn't due to his 'craftsmanship' that Ka'ra was injured. Watching Yuri munch down the meat, the scout furrowed his brow and took another sniff of the food. **"Hmm … guess I'll find out soon enough. I didn't notice the taste before, but if it's Yimdarin Pepper, there may be a problem."** Looking to Yuri, Drem's face was painted with a slight worried look. **"You see, on Yimdarin, they sell various spices that are derived from the plants in their jungles. Well, the pepper that they create is from this neat little, yellow plant that has some of the spiciest seeds I've ever tasted. And, while Yimdarin is out in the middle of no where, they manage to send trade ships to the Core Worlds once a year to barter. These seeds, after processing and such, have a citrus taste to them, almost like Delvonian Limes, but they deliver a heat as well, making it a viable pepper to use when spicing meat … especially nerf."** Taking another drink, he looked at Yuri and finished his tale. **"Well, to make a long story short, while the pepper is good, it also acts like a laxative and, I just ate enough to keep me in the head for about a week. Hmm … maybe I should talk to the cook …"**

**"Agreeable is good. I am certainly more a fan of agreeable, than it's alternative."**
Sajin frowns in amusement as the turbolift speeds off towards his destination. Although he half-jests with the other Jedi, he does not seem overly concerned with further dissent amongst the ranks. When Lanius mentions something about the Nagai needing rest, Sajin hitches his rucksack up higher on his shoulder in a shrug.
**"Rest is for the elderly and those that can afford it, and unfortunately I am neither. …How old are you again, Lanius?"**
The lift doors open just as Sajin asks his question. Flashing the human a sly grin, Sajin steps out of the lift and waves farewell to Lanius without looking back, the Nagai's long stride easily taking him through the cruiser's stark confines until he arrives in the Galley. Looking around, it doesn't take him long to catch sight of Yuri and Drem sitting at one of the mess tables, and when the Shadow does see them he makes his way over, offering a half salute.
**"Greetings to you both. Yuri, you, I, Fiolla, and the one known as Tendau will be taking rotations guarding the Force Harvester, along with some of Captain Prius's best soldiers. The idea is to always have someone trained in using the Force on alert, in case we are infilitrated by someone that can do the same. If you will accompany me as I gather the others, we will then discuss the different shift alottments."**
Sajin stands with the one hand shoved into a pocket and the other holding his pack, although his attention is less for the reactions of the other two men and more for what they are eating. The Nagai's nostrils flare slightly as he inhales a whiff of the ship's offerings, and he resolves himself to nibble at the rations that he had brought for himself, for the duration of their travel on board.

Sensing his point didn´t really make it through, Yuri smiled a bit friendlier towards Drem. He hoped for his friends sake that those peppers weren´t laxative. Personally, he knew few tricks or so for purging minor illnesses and toxins out of his blood, but Drem didn´t have the Force to fall back on.
**"See, my point exactly. You don´t have anything to do with whatever injuries Ka'ra has, she was beat up real good before we even left the station. The only injury you might be responsible for is if she tripped over a loose wire or something aboard that scrapheap"**
Sensing something approaching, Yuri turned his head to see Sajin come waking into the mess.
**"Look, what I´m saying is, if you know there´s no credit to what someone says, don´t mind it. Especially when it´s people who don´t even know you"**
Turning his head towards the approaching Nagai, Yuri listened to what he said. He thought about giving Lanius a hard time for "outing" him, though he figured the circumstances had called for it. Of course, he guessed Sajin could have found out his own, as he too was apparently trained in using the Force. Getting up from the table, he go ready to go.
**"Sure thing. Do we have any particular reason to suspect that anyone trained in the Force would be coming for it anytime soon, or are we just generally cautious?"**

*Hmmm,* the ithorian ponders to himself. *This one's injuries could be more serious than they look, and they already look serious enough as it is.* Pacing over to the injured human, the jedi falls into a bit of a trance as he approaches her, reaching out with the force to ascertain if there are hidden injuries that might be ailing her, before conducting the more traditional approach of a non forcesentive doctor. **Well lets see what we can do for you Ka'ra,** Tendau states as he pulls a med pack from the cabnet and gets to work on the warrior.

Tendau looks over the Mandalorian with a practiced eye, taking in the visible bruises common to a dislocated shoulder, but then sees them spreading down below the top of her tanktop. If he were to guess, it was caused by a strong impact and depending on how she hit the object might have broken a couple ribs as well. As the Ithorian attempts to move closer, Ka'ra tenses up and without much warning throws a punch straight at one of her would be doctor's throats. Landing true, a rather lucky feat considering her state and the use of only one arm, Tendau is forced backward by the ferocity of the blow while Ka'ra then attempts to move past him toward the door into the hallway. (( Tendau takes **18 damage** and **-1 CT** from Ka'ra's critically placed punch (nat 20) ))

*HA! Caught him completely by surprise! Maybe Jedi aren't so tough hehehe!… Wait, wait… she just punched Tendau! What the…* Tanith finds the look on the Ithorian Jedi's face comical until it registers in his head that Ka'ra had actually struck the well meaning being.
**"OY!!!"** Tanith yells, hoping to grab her attention as he moves to block her path out, **"What the hell was that about lass? What's the matter with you?"** he asks confused and more than a little angry at the attack on an ally. He motions Emily behind him, fearing the girl would get to close to Ka'ra. A wounded Mandalorian is more dangerous out of their armor and if the girl got within reach she could be hurt badly.
*Hell, I could be hurt badly…* he thinks as he realizes how close to her he is.

**"This is as a precaution. We stole an darkside artifact from a powerful man steeped in the Force; every measure must be seen to."**
Sajin then offers another brief salute to Drem before he beckons to Yuri to follow him. The Nagai stalks his way through the mess hall to an adjoining hallway, and there he begins to navigate his way back to the launch bay, intent on recovering Tendau from the At'in Oyaka. As he makes his way through the cavernous space cruiser, he speaks over his shoulder to the other man while keeping his eyes searching for directional signs and identifying placards.
**"We have secured the Harvester in an armory, and will use this rotation until our next berth. Lanius intends to keep moving until we come across a means for deactivating or destroying the Harvester for good."**

**"Good, the sooner we can dispose of that thing forever, the better. But we should probably wait until we know the universe won´t implode on its destruction"**
Yuri followed behind Sajin, looking around him as they walked to try an familiarize himself with the layout of the ship. He was looking forward to getting a closer look at the Force Harvester, as he hadn´t really got a good look at it before. He wasn´t overly thrilled at the thought that someone trained in the Force might come for it, but on the other hand, he had had very little contact with Sith Assassins or other Force trained adversaries in the last year, so it might be a nice chance of pace from abttling pirates and slavers.
**"Oh yeah, I suppose it might be efficient if we all exchange comm codes this time around, so we can at least talk to each other. I´m pretty certain things would have gone a lot smoother earlier if we hadn´t forgot about that"**

Tendau, still recovering puffs, in air through one of his other mouths as he takes in the young woman who just assaulted him. For the moment, through the pain, he's unable to form words.
With her path blocked by Tanith, she stops her eyes growing wide once more and her body tenses up as if preparing for a fight. Her focus is entirely on the man blocking her path out of the medbay, a place she doesn't entirely wish to be at the moment.
From her place out of the way, Emily doesn't make a move, watching the scene obviously concerned and not entirely as dumb as Tanith would think as she knows better than to get in Ka'ra's way when she's upset.
A voice rings out softly from the hallway, audible enough not to startle anyone inside. "**I would let her past, Tanith,**" Lanius directs calmly from his position in the doorway where he was taking in the last moments of the tableau. "**We can set things right once she's calmed down.**"
********************************************
The ride back to the hanger bay is not so long from the galley, taking only a few minutes in the optimized lift. The doors to the lift open to reveal the long hallway along with its couple turns leading to the hanger bay where the Citadel-class cruiser with it's docked custom fighter of an unusual design rests. Nearby the Dynamic-class freighter you arrived on with Lanius is being looked over and the shuttle is being unloaded of its cargo. From the distance, you see the ramp to the Citadel-class cruiser has been left open as if someone was expecting your arrival.
********************************************
Drem finds himself alone in the galley without the companions he arrived with. He returns to the table after his brief conversation with the cook, who just rolled his eyes at the scout and informed him he had an overactive imagination.

**"I should've asked to look at that cook's creden-"** The scout cut himself short, quickly realizing that he was alone in the cafeteria. **"Bantha spit,"** he muttered, looking around. Thinking for a moment, he came to the conclusion that the others left to take care of personal things. Packing up his gear, Drem left the galley and began wandering the halls of the large ship, his curiousness getting the better of him. As he walked, he began whistling the old Core Worlds pop classic *'Space Lanes, Trade Lanes'*, greeting others with a smile or a quick "Hello" until something caught his eye.

Eyes still watering the jedi finally struggles enough to get breath back into his lungs from the feral punch he had received from the wounded mandolorian. **Do as Lanius says Tanith, fighting her will only do more harm to her,** and rubbing his throat again with his left hand he continues, **and as you can see us as well.** Walking over to a vidscreen Tendau checks out the damage done to his throat from the blow he had taken while caught unawares. *Always caught up in what I'm doing, never taking enough time for my surroundings, another hard lesson as Master Garrus would say.* Not seeing any extreme damage and relazing it will be sore for the next few days the Ithorian curses himself for not keeping his guard vigilant even when trying to administer aid to an ally.
**Any Ideas on How to calm her down Lanius, the aid I attempted to entreat was….**trailing off for a second and rubbing his throat again he finishes **…was met with resistance.**

**"Calming is what I'm trying to do Jedi,"** Tanith replies to Lanius as he moves slightly to his right so that he isn't completely blocking the path. As Tendau seconds the other Jedi he says, **"The last thing on my mind is hurting her friend Tendau."**
He lowers his center of gravity, bringing his eyes lower than hers trying to gain and maintain eye contact. **"Do you hear that lass? None of us want to hurt you. Can you hear me, Ka'ra of clan Bralor? Can you hear me, Shining Star?"** he asks, his voice dropping and lowering, taking a much softer tone than he's used to date as he makes himself as non-threating as he can. The sound in his own voice shocks him a bit, and he's thankful he was fairly quiet, hopefully no of those in the room will hear the inflection.
*Hells. I don't know if I want her to hear it…*

### **Alicia** (2010-10-05 21:50:29)

While Ka'ra's path is not longer blocked by Tanith her attention stays with him as he speaks to her softly in an attempt to assuage whatever has come over her. Whether it's his tone, words, or a combination of both the fear in her eyes dissipates and her body, once tense for a fight, relaxes. Now in her eyes comes the realization of what had happened as she looks around at those in the medbay. Unable to meet Tanith's and especially Tendau's gaze she gives a hasty apology and flees out the door past Tanith and Lanius, who watches with concern as she heads for her quarters.
Once she's out of sight he turns his attention back to those remaining, entering the medbay to get a better look around. "**Perhaps it would be best to tell me what happened?**" he says, slowly looking between Emily, Tanith and Tendau.

**"Bloody damned good question. Bloody damned good. She was wounded, tried to give her a painkiller, sent for Tendau,"** he says mostly to the wall with his mind obviously elsewhere. **"When you find out, let me know eh?"** Tanith replies as he heads out of the crowded medbay and towards the cockpit, fighting to keep from pausing at Ka'ra's door and succeeding. Once in the cockpit he begins running diagnostics on the ship's computer, drastically avoiding thinking of the recent incident. *Wonder if Niandra will let me take a fighter out and show these greenies a thing or two. Wonder if the lass… Damn!* he thinks as he finds himself failing.

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Alicia** (2010-10-07 10:45:59)

There's a frown on Lanius's expression as he watches Tanith leave before turning his attention back to Tendau. "**The painkiller itself wouldn't have set her off like that. Where is it?**" With a broad gesture, Tendau motions to where Tanith had put the syringe away in the cabinet. It doesn't take long for him to find it and he looks it over for a moment before looking up at the other two. "Before it happened, was anything said or done?"
From her place where she had taken refuge Emily voices up her thoughts. "**Ka'ra was stacking her armor when Tanith said something like, 'I'lll give you a nice dose of a painkiller to put you out for awhile.' And then she freaked out.**" Lanius nods his thanks to Emily, the mystery apparently solved enough for his tastes. He turns again to pull out several more of the cold packs from the cupboard. He doesn't say much else as he gather his supplies and leaves.
From his new position in the cockpit, Tanith gets a good look at the two approaching the ship. Both the Nagai and the human walking purposefully for the Atin Oya'ka are the same wayward "crew" Lanius and Ka'ra arrived with from their previous mission. On closer inspection of the consoles it becomes evident that the last person on, Lanius, left the ramp open.
********************************
Drem wanders about the ship, taking in the simple sights provided by this exemplary specimen of the Hammerhead-class cruiser. Captain Prius obviously keeps a by the book running of her ship, her recent escapade in assisting in Lanius's endeavor behind the Republic apparently highly unusual for the career captain.
It's walking down one of these hallways that Drem suddenly hears the whispered mutterings between a quartet of the ship's crew. The tech and three officers stop talking as they hear Drem's enthusiastic whistling and the tech looks over to him and blinks before heading off. The trio begin to walk off as well, moving past Drem as they apparently move to somewhere more private for their discussion.

Nodding with a smile to the trio that begin to move past him, Drem asks in a friendly voice, **"Hey guys, how's it going?"** Not waiting for a response, he continues on as if finding three new friends. **"This ship sure is big. I've been on a few of the bulk loaders, but never anything quite this large before. Mostly scout ships and the like, y'know?"** Not waiting for an answer again, he took in each of the trios faces and expressions and asked, **"So what're you guys up to? That other guy sure bolted, huh? Hope he's okay …"**

*Bloody wonderful. Another Jedi. What the hell is this one anyway? Some kinda offshoot I guess. Pale, funny ears. Nice hair though. Hmmm, wonder what the other one's story is,* Tanith's thoughts ramble as he tries to distract himself. *Damned Lanius, you'd think this was his ship, way he goes around just leaving the ramp down…* Tanith sits up with an odd expression from where he was leaned over the console near the pilot's seat. *Am I really acting like I'm half my age? If I'm acting that way why can't I feel that way too? Or look it, for that matter. Heh! Gotta get a hold of myself. Get myself something to do. Idle hands and minds are a Hutt's best friend, that's what Momma Lai used to say.*

Walking aboard the ship, Yuri looked around, and slightly disoriented he opened himself to he Force to locate Tendau. Finding the Ithorian in the company of some of the others. He was sensing a bit of tension in the room, though he decided against getting involved in anything that didn´t concern him. He turned his head to Tendau.
**"Hey, you got a minute? Me and Spooky would like to have a word with you, and Fiolla too, in case anyone knows where she is"**
He looked behind himself to see if Sajin had followed him. After all, he knew more than Yuri about what they were supposed to do.

## Re: Chapter One: Into the Gundark's Pit

### **Alicia** (2010-10-11 20:34:44)

Entering the cruiser, the two Jedi encounter Ka'ra's strill at the entrance. Guarding the opened ramp first the creature stands defiantly daring you to pass it, but it quickly turns into play as it bounds toward Sajin in an attempt to knock him over and then Yuri to do the same before running off deeper into the ship. The cruiser itself has two levels this main level containing the cargo hold and engine room as well as the airlocks for the two docking clamps. Passing through the cargo hold, the two catch sight of several crates marked in an unknown language and a speeder bike.
Catching up to the strill, it waits for the two at the bottom of the ladder up, but it quickly scurries, half flies up onto the second deck. It's quick to bound off again as it leads them down the hall toward where Lanius and Tendau are in the medbay, the former gathering some medical supplies from the cabinets. He spares the two Jedi a nod as he finishes and then leaves.
***********************************************
Tanith sees the two disappear into the ship and soon after he can hear some talking coming from within the medbay he had just vacated. It's not long either before Tanith's strill playmate bounds into the cockpit and attempts to ineffectually climb into the pilot's lap as if it was a small and cuddly kitten
***********************************************
Two of the trio return Drem's nod, but apparently not one to chit chat with others outside of the crew the other simply says, "**Isn't there somewhere you're supposed to be? *Passengers* shouldn't be wandering about.**"

### **Magical2099** (2010-10-11 21:20:14)

**"Aye, come on slobber dispenser,"** Tanith says chuckling at the strill. He sits back and allows the beast to drape itself over most of him, most legs hanging off to one side and head close to his chest. He wishes briefly that he had put his helmet back on to avoid the smell, but it was now trapped beneath his and the animal's weight. He lifts a gauntleted hand to scratch around the ears and back of the head on the beast, looking for the sweet spot.
**"The lass said you were awfully intelligent, so what's the matter with me, eh?"** he asks rhetorically. **"What set her off for that matter?"** he asks as he finds the spot and scratches and rubs vigorously, **"That better?"** he says, finally asking a question the strill might be able to answer.

**"I suppose,"** the scout said. **"But I'm a bit of an explorer at heart, y'know? The others all seemed pretty busy, so I took a walk and ended up here."** Eying the one that spoke to him, Drem made a point to look at his name badge while still smiling. **"I didn't realize that I wandered so far into the bowels of the ship. Hey, you think one of you guys could show me back to the hangar? I took some twists and turns here and there … and I've never been that good with direction …"**

Turning as the others enter and still trying to comprehend what had happened with Ka'ra, the ithorian acknowledges the arrival of the two new comers. As he tries to formulate what happened again he turns and apologizes to Lanius, **I did not pay attention to my patient as she tensed up I thought she was in shock. As I went to help her she lashed out at me and as you saw scurried off. Once she has calmed down if you would like me to take a look at her let me know, I just dont want her to continue to struggle in the condition she is in she is bound to hurt herself gravely, and…** rubbing his throat one last time he continues  **Most likely one of us as well.** 
Turning back to the newcomers the young jedi bows in greeting. **I'm Tendau Mimwen, Yuri I've met, but you would be?**  directing his greeting towards the pale newcomer.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-10-14 11:07:41)

Yuri rubbed his neck a bit as he heard how Ka'ra had apparently behaved. He can´t say he was surprised she didn´t want medical treatment - she seemed like the kind who took care of herself, and was proud of being able to do so as well - though he raised an eyebrow when he heard she has lashed out at Tendau. He figured she had had some reason, though he´d much like to hear it. Maybe he should pay her a visit later on.

Officer Jensen, as indicated by his name badge, looks at Drem dubiously. "**Getting lost isn't rather productive of an explorer,**" he says. "We can take you as far as the lift, after that you should be able to find your way again." Starting to walk again the three men soon split, nodding in farewell as they part ways. Soon Drem is left only with Jensen who stops outside of a lift. "**Deck 5, left out of the lift and then your first right. End of the hall is the hanger bay. Easy enough.**" He doesn't wait for the scout to give him a response as he continues on his way down the hall.
**************************************
The strill's mouth lulls open in response to Tanith's queries, showing its row of sharp teeth, and its tail flicks in amusement. As Tanith finds the sweet spots to scratch, its eyes close and a low content purr rumbles from its chest. In response to the pilot's last question, Tentia opens its eyes and plants a slobbery lick across any of Tanith's exposed flesh before jumping down awkwardly from his lap and bounds out of the cockpit.
**************************************
Lanius stops just before leaving, turning to give Tendau a last nod. "**Shock may have been part of it, but not completely. I will tell her and perhaps in a little bit you can come see her.**" Leaving the medbay completely he heads for Ka'ra's door, across the hall and a door toward the stern from the medbay. He knocks but doesn't wait for her to respond as he enters right away.
The Nagai nods, giving the Ithrorian a half bow in greeting, "Sajin," he says shortly and then starts again as he gets down to business. "**Lanius has suggested we set rotations in guarding the Force Harvester, along with some of Captain Prius's best soldiers. The idea is to always have someone trained in using the Force on alert, in case we are infilitrated by someone that can do the same. You were… recommended, as well as Foilla who Lanius says is in the medbay of the Valiant.**" The last he says for Yuri's benefit.

*Gods what a creature,* Tanith thinks as he checks his belt for a rag to wipe the slobber away with. Task done, he keys up the com code to the hanger control as he decides to do something about his boredom.
**"Hanger Control, this is Tanith Hoagra, formerly of the Republic Navy and still one of the best snub-fighter pilots around. Where are your sims located and do you have any decent records worth my breaking?"**

**"I suppose you're right,"** Drem chuckled. **"But how does one become a good explorer if they don't get lost a few times, eh?"** Following the officer, the scout goes to step into the lift but quickly turns, saying, **"Hey, uh, thanks …"** Not waiting, he boarded the lift and felt it shift as the doors slid shut with a quiet 'shhh'. **"I've got a bad feeling about this,"** he said to himself as he rode the lift back up to the galley. *Better find the others,* he thought.

**Of course, proper security would be most proper until it can be disposed of permanently.

The accessible spaces of the ship quickly seem to clear out as Yuri, Sajin and Tendau go their separate ways. "**You will be taking the next shift. Six hour exchanges should work for the time being.**" Sajin says on the matter. "**An armory has been secured to store the Harvester. I'm sure you won't have any problems finding it.**" Walking together for part of the way to the *Titan Valiant*'s medbay, the two Jedi encounter Drem as he exits the lift, following the directions Officer Jensen had given him.
****************************************
Tanith would probably be unsurprised to discover that the location of the pilots' briefing and exercise rooms near the hanger bay; the deck also housing the launch tubes for the cruiser's snubs. While control doesn't know the current record for the sims, she does mention a flyboy who has been mouthing off in the mess about a record he finds rather impressive.

After moving past the two other force sensitive beings, Tendau moves swiftly to his quarters. A few familiar turns later and the Jedi walks deliberately into his room. Removing his outer cloak and hanging it over a chair he stretches briefly and drops into a meditative position and reaches out to feel the ebb and flow of the force and loses himself in a meditative trance.
If uninterrupted Tendau will remain so until he is retrieved for his guard shift or he has regenerated his stamina and bearings.

**"Aye? Well, lets see if we can't fix that, eh? Heh,"** he says as he stands and memorizes the directions. As he leaves the cockpit he can't help but pause briefly at Ka'ra's door, before continuing on to the sims.
Once he arrives, he finds a data terminal and pulls up the standings, looking for all logged personal bests on board and to see if any of the battles he'd flown in are now being used for training. He looks around the lounge, seeing if there was anyone in here to help direct him, though he was confident he didn't need aid.

**"All right, I´ll let Fiolla know as well. Will you be taking the first shift?"**
Yuri walked next to Sajin as the other was apparently also heading in a similar direction as him. He figured he probably knew the answer to the question he just asked, the Nagai hadn´t seemed like a guy who liked letting the Harvester out of his sight for a moment, but he asked anyway just to be sure. As they wandered by a pair of turbolifts, Yuri spotted Drem coming out of one of them.

Looking a bit nervous as he exited the lift, Drem heard Yuri's questioning greeting. **"Am I glad to see you,"** the scout said with a slight smile as he quickly closed the space between them. Making sure they were in semi-whispering distance, Drem looked around and, when clear, quietly said, **"I think we might have a problem. I was down a few decks and ran into some crew that were acting pretty conspicuous … one of 'em … Jensen … talked to me while the others scattered. Not sure what's going on, but I got a bad feeling off of them.

Yuri raised an eyebrow when Drem told him what had passed and turned to give Sajin a look before turning back to the scout. He didn´t pay much attention to Drem´s nervous look, and kept his voice rather normal as he spoke.
**"Well, I wouldn´t rule it out. Though there could be other explanations as well. Still, I suppose it could be worth looking into. Anyway, it seems we can´t be too hasty in getting our little security operation up"**
He looked over at Sajin, smiling a bit.
