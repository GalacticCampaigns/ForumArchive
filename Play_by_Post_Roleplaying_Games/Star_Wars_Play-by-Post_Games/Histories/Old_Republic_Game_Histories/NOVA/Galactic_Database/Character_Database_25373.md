**Personality**
Previously cocky, gung-ho, happy-go-lucky, self-focussed, assured and happy in a life that laughed at authority (he has killed or harmed no-one), Toran is becoming a more thoughtful seeker, curious about this almost spiritual aspect to life that has grown around him. Still assured, with a “can-do” attitude, his insights into the atrocities of crime cartels has caused him to regret the support he gave them and has, in general, curbed his excesses; the wish to redress the balance has given him the drive to join NOVA.

**Brief Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Toran Pelor, an ineffective human smuggler who has had numerous run-ins with customs. Whilst he has lost a great deal of contraband he has also had a suprising amount of luck when he's really needed it. He's starting to develop a tendency to rely on his instincts and gut because, well, they have gotten him out of some big scrapes and when he's ignored them, he has always fallen foul of the customs, gangmembers, drugrunners, Hutts... the anstier it is, the more his instincts have helped.
He’s increasingly focussed on this ‘gut’ and has found it can help him influence others in tight spots and boost his own skills (he has made jumps that even he could not believe). Few others seem to have quite the same instinct, so it’s an edge he's wanted to explore for a while. Using it and relaxing *into* it seems to work....
His smuggling activities to date have been with masters who are normally committed to smuggling luxury goods or artwork. On a recent smuggling run, though, he found that some of the objets d’art were filled with a particularly addictive and potentially fatal drug: the only cure was to take more. This was deliberately being dumped into the shanty-towns of the under-class to turn a whole quarter into the personal, totally dependent, slave army of a particularly obnoxious Hutt.
Though told to keep his mouth shut, Toran found that the fear and desperation of those accepting delivery were completely overwhelming – it was as if something in that terrified and desperate populace was seriously affecting him. Driven by their need, he could do nothing else but relieve them of that through bringing the problem to the authorities and, in supporting the police, killing the Hutt himself when the advisory group he was with was ambushed.
As a result, he's become really uncomfortable with his role in life, as if he should be concerned with much more than himself. It's as if he's... connected, somehow, with everyone else and he's not sure how. It can be extremely unpleasant, this being driven to think of others or being driven to redress imbalance, but he is impelled to do so.
Wisdom is growing and a new trade is on the horizon.

Backstory:<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Born to two human slaves on a small Mi-Rim world, Miral's first site was the leering face of her owner, a fat, corpulent Twi'lek named Kalath Drono. His leering face leaned over her, the smile growing as Drono realized Miral was a girl. That was the last time her parents ever saw her.
From the day she could walk, she served as a source of pleasure for Drono, be it fighting animals, fighting other children, or... other things. By the time she was five, she had already killed 5 other children, former play mates. With each death, she increased in skill, but the pain she felt from killing playmates left her broken. Every night she cried herself to sleep, knowing the next morning she would have to kill, or fight, something close to her. By the time she turned 7, she gave up on attachments altogether.
The next decade of her life was monotony, constant fighting and killing. By the time she was 10, she gave up counting how many peers she had killed. Throughout this time, Drono's scientists experimented with implants on her, heedless of the damage they were doing. Each implant, crudely shoved in, pushed her to new heights of violence, increasing her pleasure and adrenaline every time she killed. But, with each use, the implants burned out; a new one would be added, the results would be cataloged, Drono would sell the results to mercenary groups, ostensibly to improve fighting abilities. And Miral's life spun on filled with blood and death, her only periods of peace when the implants were working, dulling her to all physical sensations.
Beyond the science team Drono controlled, there were also more... esoteric endeavors that Drono pursued. These agents were rumored to have magical powers, the ability to throw lightning, see the future, or even read minds. Whatever the truth to these satements, Miral simply knew them as the beings that would catch her when she escaped, using what appeared to be magic.
But, when she turned 18, Drono lost interest in her, turning his attention again to newly born younger slaves. Now left without any purpose, even that of plotting revenge on the man who had controlled her life, she was thrown into the gladiatorial arena, where she slaughtered her way through countless opponents. With each victory, she became harder and harder, content to give in to the adrenaline rush that fighting brought her. With each victory, she wrote and affixed the name of her opponent to her armor.
After 5 years in gladiatorial arenas, fighting broke out between the Imperials and the Republic, her world caught in the crossfire. Seizing the opportunity, she butchered her way gleefully through the arena's guards, escaping to a Republic ship. Once aboard, she was tranquilized and restrained, and a man from something called NOVA told her of how she could serve the Republic...

</details>

Personality And appearance: Miral is gruff, harsh, but acts more than she talks. She tries to provoke battles with others, seeking the sense of normalcy that constant fighting, just as in her youth, brings her. Miral is about 1.8 meters tall, well muscled, and covered in scars on her arms and torso. Her eyes are a vibrant blue, standing out in her tanned face. Her hair is black.

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Tav Fey'jeg is a rash and reckless Bothan. He was found to be a natural leader and was recruited into the officer training program in the Bothan military. After the Bothan military heard the call from NOVA for recruits for the program, they recommended their reckless officer Tav Fey’jeg (nicked named “gambler” by his fellow colleagues because of his risky tactics that somehow always paid off) both because he’s good and because they don’t want him influencing the other officers being trained to be reckless and risky. (having ones enough)
