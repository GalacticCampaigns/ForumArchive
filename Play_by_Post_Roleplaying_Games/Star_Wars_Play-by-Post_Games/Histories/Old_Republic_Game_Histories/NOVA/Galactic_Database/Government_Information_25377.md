<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Hertulle Commonwealth**</span>
**Capital** : Calamar, Esseles, Essesia system, Darpa sector, Core Worlds
**Government Type** : Monarchy
**Military Strength** : Small to Moderate Size, Technically Advanced, Highly Trained
**Societal** : 70% Human, 20% Mix of Twi'leks, Sullustans, Bothans, 10% Other. Semi-Xenophobic
The Hertulle Commonwealth was founded shortly after the Unification Wars ended by a group of noble families. With an interest in maintaining peace but strength their focus has been technological advancement. With their capital in Calamar, Esseles they expanded their boarders, giving each system semi-autonomous control. There are four primary noble families that are considered of royal line, descendent from the original founding families, but there are six other families that are eligible for the ruling seat during the electoral process held every ten years. Although the electoral process is not open to the public, the public does have sway to which family will rule over the Commonwealth for the next ten years. The voting is done between the families, each family having only so many votes, but those families will listen to the public of the systems under their stewardship. Part of the process states that no family can rule for two consecutive cycles, so there is always a change in leadership and the current ruling family will usually vote for whichever family is currently in highest favor among the Commonwealth.
In the past hundred years the Commonwealth has grown more xenophobic of the species predominately outside of their borders. With the Imperial Regime pushing fast and hard for domination and control they have increased their military strength around their borders. So far every skirmish that has occurred has ended in the Commonwealth's favor, even when the losses were severe or they were largely outnumbered. Their tactical and technical abilities with their fleets have a long standing of awe among the rest of the galaxy.
With the increased technological advancements and overall focus on education and training a large portion of the population are artisans of some sort. Every major city within the Commonwealth is filled with elegant architecture, vibrant culture, and colorful art and recreation. The citizens of the Commonwealth take great pride in their government, its overall stableness, and their well to do living style.
