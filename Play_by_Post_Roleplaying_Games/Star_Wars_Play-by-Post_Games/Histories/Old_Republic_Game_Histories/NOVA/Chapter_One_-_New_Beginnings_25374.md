*On Commenor in the city of Kliffen at a local pub, the "Starlight," a pair of gentlemen sit across from each other in a large booth. Each were well dressed though no distinctions could be made of their political affiliation.*
The Starlight was a lesser known pub in Kriffen but still well visited by the locals. The pub was long but not very deep, with the east wall mostly made if large tinted windows facing the street. Though some light came through it allowed for the reddish glow of the establishments overheads to give everything a red hue. Booths were set up along the west wall while a bar had been built into the north wall, manned by a young female Twi'lek of pink complexion and a middle aged human male. A moderately size stage was built up on the south end with a cleared space in front if it for dancing. Several tall tables were placed along the east wall while shorter tables and matching chairs filled the center in no organized pattern.
The day was drawing to an end and the light from outside was fading fast. The Starlight was reaching near capacity as the locals began filtering in after a long days work. Multiple species filled the room and a band was setting up on the stage and going through sound checks.
The older gentleman looked up again from his data pad and out across the crowd. He recognized a few faces now from the files and nodded to his younger companion. "**It's time. Have James go through and instruct our guests over to us. Time for the formal introductions and to see if they are ready.**"
The younger man nodded in response, "**Yes Sir.**." He pulled a com link from a fold in his jacket and double tapped the transmitter and waited a few seconds before hearing a triple click back. Placing the comlink back in his jacket he looked out over the crowd and watched for his man to approach the first of the group they had hoped to form for the betterment of the Republic.

Okay here we go. Thus last week has been hell on my schedule between work and family.
Post where you are in the Starlight with a brief description of yourself and what your doing.
You were all told to meet here by an agent who sought you out for one reason or another, but not who you were meeting outside a Rep of the Republic.
