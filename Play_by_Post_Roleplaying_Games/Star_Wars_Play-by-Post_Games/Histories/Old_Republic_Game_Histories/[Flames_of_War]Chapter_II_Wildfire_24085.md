# [Flames of War]Chapter II: Wildfire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-04-18 17:46:01)

*After their victory at Myrkr, the Mandalorian forces moves on, their fleets rolling in across the Galaxy. The Republic does the best to halt their progress, but the enemy seems stronger indeed. Without support from the Jedi Council and the Order, the Republic effort seems doomed to fail. Until one man steps in and singlehandedly changes the course of the war. Revan. Having sent his followers across the Outer Rim to scout the enemy effort and assist the Republic, Revan now commits himself fully to the war effort. Thanks to his strategic mind, and excellent knowledge of war, ths conflict might still be winnable.
Meanwhile, in another part of the Rim, Jedi Padawans Ava and Lorn finds themselves locked up in the holding cell of a Mandalorian ship. Far from the frontlines, their vessel serves as more of a command post than a battle ship, and also fills…other purposes. They have been held ever since the battle at Myrkr, awaiting to "see the doctor", as the Mandalorians say. Disturbingly enough, none of them seems to be fully comfortable saying that…*
Ava and Lorn remains in their cell, the only place they have seen for a few weeks now. For some reason though, they have been kept well fed and undisturbed, something that could be concerning enough. No one has appeared to care very much for them at all, just as if they have been waiting for something. They also havenÂ´t seen any sign of Lor since their capture.
Suddenly, they hear a muffled sound from outside their cells, almost like combat. After a few moments, things falls silent, and their cell door opens. Outside they can see the bodies of two Mandalorian warriors lying on the ground, smoking lightsaber wounds across their chests. Standing over at a computer console in the middle of the room they see a female Cathar, wearing Jedi robes, flanked by two humanoids in similar dresses, as well as a droid of unknown make. The Cathar smiles at them.
"These Mando sure knows how make doors. Luckily there are other ways to get through them than to slice them open. How are you feeling?"
((OK, weÂ´re on. Lorn and Ava have been locked up in prison ever since. You still have all your possessions, except for your lightsabers of course. The other people are part of a squad sent to rescue them who have managed to get on board the enemy ship. DonÂ´t worry about the details of how, they will follow))

Lorn had been meditating when the combat started, and was quickly roused by the sound of blasterfire. When the door slides open, he drops into a defensive crouch. It may have been a long last few weeks, but he wasn't ready to go yet. He still had fight left in him.
When he saw it was a Cathar Jedi, he eased up. Someone had come to rescue them finally. Lorn hadn't really been expecting it. Who knew of their location, anyway? It could very well have been much longer until they'd been found.
In response to the Cathar's question, Lorn answers, "I'm doing well, all things considering. If you don't mind me asking, what are you doing here?"

SG kept it's right arm raised, ready to fire on any hostile's that might appear. "Forgive me Maam, but my circuits dislike this vessel. I'd prefer it if we left before more of those Mandolorians show up." SG articulated every word as well as any droid could, but put extra emphasis on the final few words. His crimson photo-receptors continued to observe the area. "My programming states I should get you to safety and I do not think this place will stay safe for long."

The tall humanoid steps into a better lighting for the two prisoners to see him. He is dressed in a white Jedi robe with a blue tunic. His eyes are covered by a ceremonial covering that should be recognized as Miraluken. Then lanky male figure was a Miraluka and from his looks from that of the Medical Corp. His Grey hair was shown as he lowered his hood, showing his appearance to be that of a Male in his mid twenties.
His voice was deep as he spoke.
"I believe the droid to be correct, but we must be sure our fellow Jedi are capable of moving."
He turns to the Captured Jedi (Lorn and Ava)
"Are you both well enough to travel?"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-04-19 07:17:19)

The Cathar Jedi laughs.
"We are a band of Jedi - and a droid - on board a Mandalorian ship. What do you think we are doing here? WeÂ´re getting you out of here before something bad happens to you. And believe me, according to what weÂ´ve heard you were in for a harsh ride"
She moved forward and handed Lorn and Ava their lightsabers.
"Here, I found these in a security locker. You might need them. We managed to infiltrate this ship aboard a cargo delivery run, but we donÂ´t know how long our cover will hold. weÂ´ve been forced to dispatch of a few soldiers on out way here, and itÂ´s only a matter of time before someone notices"
She turns back towards the people that had accompanied her.
"We need a ride out of here, and I think I saw something back in the hangar that would suffice. Keep the door secure until these guys are ready to leave"

"I feel I should again point out. I am proficient in piloting many vessels, and believe I am superior to many." SG-01 continued to guard the door, ready to fire stunblasts at anything that appeared. Whilst well programmed in ranged combat, SG always felt stunning an opponent was better than killing them, if nothing else it meant informaiton could be gotten from them.

Rhodo kept his lightsaber ignited, nervously glancing between the prisoners and the door. In his mind the security seemed a little weak for two force users. Even retrieving the lightsabers seemed easier than it should have been. Though that could be just the paranoia he was feeling, the same paranoia that kept him from deactivating his lightsaber in a period of calm. He turned to SG-1,
"There's no question that you're the better pilot, you got us here, and I know I wouldn't be able to get us out." Rhodo glances back over at the prisoners before continuing, "Since these two were captured by the Mandalorians it means they were not in the fighters. Either they lack the skill to pilot, or don't have the will to pilot. I believe it's the former rather than the latter."
He turns his gaze to Lorn, "Am I right?"

Ava's moslty sullen looks dissappear as she feels the familiar and conforting weight of her lightsaber in her hand. As she steps out of the holding cell, her mismatched eyes studies the group of rescuers for a moment, until one of them addresses Lorn.
"We're no pilots, but I fail to see how that's important at all." She snaps. "All that matters is that we are well enough to get out of here now."
She seems determined, if a bit too emotional and eager. This place had seemingly taken its toll on her.

Lorn took his lightsaber back, letting his hand wrap tightly around its black grip. When Ava snaps at their Jedi rescuers, Lorn tries to avoid flinching. A few weeks ago, an outburst like that wouldn't have caused even the slightest reaction to show on his calm exterior. Now . . . now it was different.
Then his mind drifts back to Lor . . . a friend who'd been missing since they'd come on the ship. "There was another Miraluka with us when we came aboard. Lor Horus. He was a bit younger than him," he says, gesturing at the new Miraluka. "Mid-teens, I think. You didn't happen to see him, did you?"

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-04-19 14:16:47)

The Cathar raises her hand in a motion that seemed to say "stop this nonsense" towards the droid and the Miraluka.
"That is of minor importance now isnÂ´t it, as we still donÂ´t have a ship"
Turning back towards Lorn and Ava, she motions for them to get moving out of the cell.
"I am Sisska by the way. And I am afraid I have been able to detect no more Force sensitives aboard this ship than those who are present here. But if he came here with you, risks are he is already beyond or rescue. Jedi are only captured alive for one reason. LetÂ´s get out of here while we still can"
Sprinting over to the door, the female Jedi looked around, and motioned for them to follow behind as she started to creep forward in the walkway.

Sg whirred from within for a few moments before following the Cathar. His right arm was still held high, with the integrated blaster primed and ready. He made little effort to move quietly, internally insisting that trouble would find them anyway,

Drox nods in agreement as he understand the urgency to leave the area quickly.
"You are right Sisska, I shall be more mindful of my surroundings."
Drox nods at the now free Jedi (Lorn and Ava)
"I am Drox Daklan of the Jedi Medical Corp but I suppose we better hurry and find our path out of this place before any further introductions."
Drox turns and quickly follows Sisska as she heads out the door after her. In his mind he wondered how bad being captured was for the two Jedi as the Human Female seemed to be slightly emotional while the Kel-Dor Male seemed to be at peace until her comments.

Lorn followed his rescuers, not really paying attention to his surroundings. There were a lot of thoughts flooding his head at the moment, and it was going to take time to sort them all out. What was it Master Aric had always told him? "Be mindful of your surroundings. That was the hardest lesson for me to learn. Master that, and you will be a great Jedi." That had never really been a problem before. Now it was. It was as simple as that.
As he followed the other Jedi, he kept a firm grasp on his lightsaber. He ran his thumb idly over the activation plate, not really paying attention. When the dark blue blade leapt to life, nearly spearing the droid, Lorn was dragged from his thoughts. "Sorry," he muttered, shutting down the blade.
*Pay attention, di'kut*, he berated himself. *This is important.* If he didn't pay attention, he could get someone killed, like he'd almost just done. His master's words rang in his head again. *Be mindful of your surroundings . . .*

Rhodo nodded at Sisska and followed her, keeping his lightsaber at the ready. The new jedi still seemed shocked at their rescue, the way that one of them nearly skewered SG-1. He would apologize for his comments later when they could formally introduce themselves, but now was not the time nor the place. They were still in hostile territory, an enemy could strike at any moment.
But when they did decide to strike, Rhodo would be ready with his lightsaber. Not much could go wrong with Sisska still with them, her presence on the mission was comforting. If the other jedi could keep their heads together, this could be easy. *Or would it?* Rhodo just couldn't be sure. He hadn't been sure of anything in quite some time.

As the group sneaks forward, with Sisska taking the lead, the agile Cathar suddenly stops, waving you to a halt. In a few moments, the rest of you can hear the sound of footsteps coming down the corridor.

Sg halted quickly, his centre *eye* flashed as he began a thorough scan of the area ahead, aiming to percieve the threats the moment they appeared and to see if there was anything that might be of use in the corridor. His arm was still raised, the metallic barrel of the blaster pointed at head height.

Lorn's hand fidgeted nervously over the activation plate of his lightsaber. What was happening to him? Why was he so blasted nervous all of the sudden? Trying to calm his nerves, he reached out with the Force, trying to get a sense of the intentions of the approaching . . . whatever.

Drox stops and steps to the side of Sisska. A Miraluka may not see in the same perception as other beings, but they could use the Force to provide them a perception that was just as natural to Drox as any other beings sight.
Drox uses his Force Sight and extends his minds to sense what lies ahead of them and as Drox does he looks to see if there is maybe a path around.

Rhodo stands ready, his lightsaber still lit, to face the oncoming foe. He begins to calm his mind and focus on the path ahead. *Control yourself, let the force guide your actions, and you will once again achieve victory. Do not rush into battle, but do not run from it either.* Rhodo slowly took in a breath, and let the force flow through him allowing it to guide his actions.

As all of you halt in your tracks, preparing for combat, you can hear a set of footsteps - two as far as you can count - coming from down the hall, growing steadily stronger. In a few moments, two Mandalorian soldiers appears around a corner in the corridor, roughly 20 meters ahead of you.
((You have a surprise round on the soldiers))

"Threat Detected," stated SG-01 before quickly stepping forward, whilst spewing blue stun bolts from his wrist mounted Blaster. Aiming at the Mandalorian to the left. His servos whirred and sprung into life as his combat systems began demanding resources from within.

Drox senses two Mandalorian soldiers as they appear around a corner in the corridor. Drox was not as savvy with a Lightsaber as the other Jedi, as he was a Healer not a Guardian.
Drox knows the Mandalorian soldiers have not noticed them yet and he intends to keep it that way for his fellow Jedi, he waves his hand in smooth motion at the soldiers creating a false loud noise behind them to distract them to go back the way they came.

In a combined effort, Lorn and Drox reaches out with the Force, causing both of the soldiers to hear a noise behind them, and one of them turns their head slightly. If they were distracted however, they snapped out of it as the sound of igniting lightsabers and a blazing rifle caught their attention further down the hall.
SGÂ´s rifle rings out, but the bolts scatters harmlessly into the ceiling and walls of the corridor. He was at the very peak of the range for their effect, so he shouldnÂ´t be expecting too much from the stun bolts.

Rhodo needed to move. As the first sounds of combat rang out, Rhodo found himself being drained by the Force. He needed to conserve his energy, he needed to do something. *I need to have more faith in the force to guide me, I've wasted too much time waiting for them to make the first move.* Rhodo lets go of the force energy flowing through him, and dashes towards the Mandolorians. *May the force protect me as I lead the assault.*

Drox moves swiftly towards the two Mandalorian Soldiers as he focuses on the one on the right and puts his hand up again this time he aims to put the Soldier down by attacking his nervous system, Drox had no wish to end any life be it an enemy or not.

SG continues his forward march, moving closer to the soldiers with his rifle shooting at near point blank range. A few glancing bolts graces the armor of one of the soldiers, but he looks as good as unaffected by it.
Behind the droid, Rhodo and Lorn moves up on both sides of him, preparing to attack their opponents head on.
They are met with a hail of blasterfire however, as the two soldiers reacts and opens fire. In the narrow passage, dodging is hard, and Rhodo finds his shoulder burnt by a blaster shot, and Lorn takes a similar hit, but manages to disperse it into a harmless shot through the Force. *Rhodo takes 11 damage and SG takes 6 damage*
As a blurred shape, Sisska passes in the air over her comrades, landing in a roll and coming up into a charge and lunging herself against one of the soldiers but her blade stabs into thin air where the soldier had just been.
Ava moves cautiously up behind her friends, her blade kept at the ready.
Drox follows last, reaching out through the Force to try and immobilize one of the soldiers, but if he had any effect on the warrior, it doesnÂ´t show.
Suddenly, a loud alarm begins to sound, and I think it is safe to assume that your cover has been blown.

SGÂ´s blaster rifle rings out with fire again, and this time he hits home. The stun bolts strikes the soldier straight in the gut, and he is visibly affected by the attack.
Feeling the sting from the blaster bolt, Rhodo takes a moment to catch his breath, and immerse him in the Force. As it flows through him, he feels the pain being subdued, and he can feel the Force clearly rushing through him. *Sorry Rhodo, you canÂ´t charge as Force Protection is a Standard action. But instead, you rolled a natural 20 on your Control check and regains 3 Force Strength, and you donÂ´t have to pay anything for activating Force Protection. You also gain DR 10 until the beginning of your next turn*
Seeing the soldier stagger from SGÂ´s blast, Lorn rushes headlong towards the soldier, striking with his lightsaber and digging through the manÂ´s armor and into his shoulder. Disciplined beyond reason, the Mandalorian donÂ´t let out a sound though. *Lorn regains 1 Force Strength*
Finding themselves close up with the Jedi, and in a distinct disadvantage, the Mandalorian soldiers begins to fall back. Halting the Cathar Jedi in her steps with a kick, one of the soldiers falls back, rifle raised. The second one, quite clearly affected by his injuries screams out in rage as he smashes his armored face into Lorns, and in the quick moment of respite follows his friends retreat. *Lorn takes 9 damage*
Sisska is not about to let the soldiers get away though, and with a few quick steps catches up to her prey. She throws herself into a spin to avoid his counterattack, and brings her saber down at his side, but she misses and digs a light cut into the wall.
As Lorn staggers a few steps from the headbutt, Ava moves past him, her saber raised over her head. With a single blow that tears through armor, flesh and bone, she cleaves the warrior into two pieces.
Behind his friends, Drox works to keep up. *Drox recovers 1 Force Strength*

As the remaining Mandalorian retreats down the hallway, SG lets out a spray of stun bolts, but the soldier evades the attacks.
Not keen on letting his foe get away, Rhodo uses the Force to speed his movement and take him in behind the soldier. Still filled up with the power of the Force, he swings his lightsaber against the soldier, striking him hard down the shoulder.
Following closely behind, Lorn lowers his saber and charges forward, driving his saber straight into the soldiers side, causing his to grunt in pain. *Lorn regains 1 Force Strength*
Seeing as he is nearly overwhelmed, the soldier seems to be abandoning all reason and strategy, and fight purely on instinct. Pressing the trigger even as Lorns saber digs into him, his weapon unleashes a sharp burst of blaster bolts, and only through his Force-enhanced reflexes does the Jedi manage to dodge out of the way. The shots splatters down the hallway, and both Ava, Drox and Sisska finds themselves batting away stray bolts with their sabers.
After this final effort though, the soldier seems to have no strength left, and his body slumps to the ground, the lightsaber wounds still smoking. Sisska deactivated her lightsaber, and catches up to the rest of the group.

The fight may be over but Lorn wasn't so ready to deactivate his lightsaber. He kept it up and at the ready as he followed the others to their ship. After so many weeks, he was more than ready to leave this place.
He listened to Ava's question and nodded. "Where *are* we going?" he asked, his deep voice rumbling out from his breath mask.

Taking the lead, Sisska deactivated her lightsaber as she started to move down the corridor.
"We had to sneak across a complex route to reach you undetected. However, now as the Mandalorians know weÂ´re here, I feel our best bet is to try and take the straightest possible route to the hangar and hope we donÂ´t run into too much trouble"
Seeing as at least a few of her companions had their weapons still lit, she motioned towards them.
"The danger is over for now. I would advise you to shut those down, unless you want to attract even more attention to us"

Lorn nodded as he deactivated his saber. He kept the unlit hilt in his hand, though, not quite willing to give it up yet. His fingers alternately tightened sand loosened, showing off his nervousness to anyone who was looking.
That's when he noticed what he was doing and realized his nerves were getting the best of him. He paused in his tracks for a moment and took a calming breath. Then he started back up again, at the back of the group, no longer feeling any nervousness. He was Jedi. He was better than that.

Rhodo reluctantly shut off his lightsaber. He knew that Sisska was right, the distinctive humming noises of the blades would alert any Mandalorians that weren't aware of their presence. However he kept the hilt in his hand, it was better to be cautious than reckless, and Rhodo felt he would rather fight more Mandalorians than be caught with his guard down.
Still though, Sisska was the superior jedi, she knew what she was doing. He kept his thumb over the activation plate and tried to keep his senses open as the group continued along the Mandolorian ship.

As through some miracle, your small group manages to avoid detection by any Mandalorians, although you could hear them moving down adjoining corridors or inside nearby rooms sometimes. As you get closer to the main hangar though, Sisska signals you to stay put while she looks ahead. The Cathar Jedi moves cautiously down the corridor and vanishes around the bend.

As Sisska moves on alone, Lorn stays at the back of the group, watching the corridor behind them. His nerves are one edge, though he'd never admit it. He glances at the droid and his voice is calm and collected when he speaks. "How much further to the hangar?" he asks.

Suddenly, something flickers in the air down the corridor, and SisskaÂ´s form appears. With a few quick steps, she approaches you.
"Bad news, the main entrance to the hangar has been barricaded heavily. Going through there is possible, but it wonÂ´t be easy, and I would not advise it"
Apparently a little winded, she takes a few breaths before continuing.
"There is another route though, one that leads through the vast engineering, storage and maintenance sections of this ship. It is longer, and involves getting through several maintenance tunnels, but I think we could get into the hangar without anyone noticing. With a little luck, they wonÂ´t notice weÂ´re there until we take off"
She looks over the group, clearly wanting the decision to be one of the whole group.

"We lack the time to take the long route.. And it may be guarded anyway. I suggest we go straight for the hangar and get out as fast as possible.

Before he could remark, she shoots a smile towards the droid.
"IÂ´m not talking about you SG, it would screw with your programming not to have you fight, wouldnÂ´t it?"
Clipping her lightsaber from her belt, she looked at you all.
"The main entrance to the hangar has been heavily barricaded with crates, barrels and other debris. I couldnÂ´t get a very good look inside the hangar itself, but I could sense at least a dozen soldiers in there"

A dozen soldiers? Lorn was suddenly unsure about the course of action. That was more than they'd faced back on Myrkyr when they'd ended up here, in prison. He reached out to the Force to calm himself and to judge their decided course of action. SG had a point, maybe a diversion would be a good idea.

Rhodo was unsure of their current course of action. A dozen soldiers seemed too much to take on at once. Even with only two mandolorians he still got shot. Rhodo wasnÂ´t eager to get shot again. An idea began to shape in his head, to take on a few mandos at a time.
"What if we bottleneck them? If we can take apart a small section of the barricade we may be able to lead them to us. If we open up a five, maybe ten foot square, SG can fire from behind the corner of the opening, while we wait for approaching soldiers and cover his back. If they fill the opening, we can engage in melee combat while the others have a lower chance of shooting us. What do you think?"

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

The future is an ever shifting thing, and as Lorn tries to peer into it, he feels its currents fleeting. While they differed, they all radiated a presence of dread. Whichever course they took, lives would be taken, but a frontal assault seemed to be to invite those lives to come from their little group.
Sisska ponders the idea of a distraction, but doesnÂ´t look convinced.
"It is a sound plan, but I am afraid the Mandalorians might be too disciplined to fall for it. But using the pile of debris they have stacked for us as cover makes much sense"

"I don't like this," Lorn said. "The future is clouded. Difficult to see. If we face them head on, some of us may die."
He hand alternately tightened and relaxed it grip on his saber hilt. "Maybe we should go the other way. People will still die, but it will be us. I think."
He dropped into a crouch against the wall and rested his head in his hands. "Everything is so confusing right now. The Force . . . it's not the same out here as it is in the Temple. My path is not as certain."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-07-14 14:40:12)

"Okay, I think we have spent enough time hanging around here. Follow me"
Deactivated lightsaber in hand, Sisska starts off down the corridor ahead, soon cutting down a small side passage. At the end of the small passage, you see what appears to be some sort of access hatch for service personel. As you move closer, you can see that it had once been locked by a mechanical lock, but it seems like a precise lightsaber cut has melted away most of the metal in the lock.
The Cathar Jedi stops, urging you all to enter.
"These tunnels will take us into the hangar by a different route. Hopefully, we will be able to slip into a ship without the Mandalorians spotting us. And if they do, we will be in a better position to defend ourselves than we would at a frontal assault"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-07-19 11:06:46)

As the group crawls through the maintenance tunnels, you can hear the sound of generators humming, mechanical pieces moving, and the occasional vent of steam. And of course, as soon as the systems feels the need to vent some of its hot steam from an exhaust vent, you are right in front of it. Luckily, it is nothing worse than superheated air coming at you.
After a while of crawling, you begun to hear other noises, steadily increasing in volume. The sound of soldiers moving around, shouting and taking orders, and the moving of equipment. It seems to be clear that the Mandalorians have noticed you are not coming for a frontal assault, and are now trying to adjust to the situation.
Finally, you reach another hatch, just like the one you entered through. Also this one appears to have been forcefully opened by a lightsaber blow recently, as the locking mechanism on the inside has been completely melted away. Giving it a careful nudge with the Force, Sisska opens the hatch just enough to slip through, and urges you all to be quick about doing the same.

---

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-07-23 14:56:02)

As you slip through the hatch, you quickly moves up behind a stack of crates, probably filled with spare parts or something of the like.
Looking around, you can see lines of Basilisks along one wall of the hangar, along with a wing of fighters, all arrayed in a disciplined fashion. There is also a larger ship landed there, by all your guesses a troop transport of some sort. Two soldiers is stationed near the lowered ramp of the ship, and around it the floor is littered with a few mechanic gear, suggesting that it might be undergoing maintenance.
All in all, you can count ten Mandalorian soldiers in the hangar, most spread out in positions covering the main entrance, but some have taken up positions to cover other sections of the hangar. you can also spot an E-Web blaster rigged in direction towards the entrance, manned by a pair of soldiers.
Getting a look out at space beyond, you notice the force field normally keeping the atmosphere inside the hangar stable glowing more intense than normally. It seems the Mandalorians have locked down the hangar.

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

After a few moments of looking, Ava notices some sort of computer station near the opposite end of the hangar. She could not make out any details from it, but at least it appeared as if it was used to control something.
As Lorn counts, he confirms the presence of 10 soldiers, of which 2 were manning the E-Web, and another two were stationed at the troop transport. In typical Mandalorian fashion, there isnÂ´t much debris littered about the hangar, everything is lined up in ordered stacks, neat and clean. It would seem though, as if you could sneak along the Force Field using a huge stack of crates and some of the parked freighters for cover to get to the transport ship. It seemed to offer minimum risk, as you would only have to pass a few open spaces in between the ships.
(Just to clarify, you guys are in one corner of the Force Field. The station Ava spotted is located in the other end. The transport ship is landed a little bit closer to your position)

The group carefully starts to move towards the transport ship, using the nearby stacks of crates as cover. It seems they are proceeding well, avoiding detection. As they begin to pass to the perilous areas where they need to sprint between the parked fighters, they takes it slower, moving only one at a time, but so far, so good. They are now barely around 20-25 meters from the transport, but the passage now is just open ground.

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-08-20 17:10:13)

The group moved forward with haste towards the lowered boarding ramp of the ship. Perhaps with too much haste. As about half of you have entered the ship, a blaster bolt splashes into the ship´s hull right above the ramp. In a matter of seconds, many more follows.
Lorn, the last person to walk up the ramp, hears the clattering of footsteps from the sides of the ship - most likely the guards he had distracted - and also a heavier noise. As he looks up, he can see the two soldiers trying to realign the E-Web.
As the ramp slams shut behind him, the sound of blasterfire is dampened, but unless he finds a way to keep the ramp shut, he suspects it will soon increase again.
As the others makes their way into the ship, they notice how the main hold of the ship is lined with what appears to be small alcoves containing racks apparently for storing and securing gear during travel, as well as very spartan seating. At the middle of both sides of the main hold, there are closed doors, and at the rear end of the ship appeared to be some sort of systems station.
SG quickly makes it to the cockpit, and begins to start up the ship. However, as they had already noted outside, it would be impossible to leave the hangar with the force field still intact.

Lorn's lightsaber hums to life in his hands. He needed to keep the Mandos out by any means he had, and he had a lightsaber. Touching the tip of his saber to the seam between the ramp and the hull, he began to weld it shut. That should keep them out for awhile.

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-08-22 02:48:50)

Being far from an expert, Ava does manage to locate what appears to be controls for a set of front-mounted turbolaser cannons. She also finds controls for a series of bombing hatches as - surprisingly - a bottom-mounted flamethrower. The ship seems like it was built to be able to create an open landing zone for itself, most likely to deploy the troops it is obviously meant to carry.
As Lorn puts his saber to the hull of the ship, he notices that the ship seems more or less unaffected by his weapon, although it is clearly heating up. Before he can push further though, the hatch lowers, apparently opened from the outside, and he finds himself about 2 meters from the business end of a blaster rifle.

As SG hits the controls, the ship lifts of from the ground, and starts to turn, swinging around towards the soldiers. He notices that the weapons Ava discovered (the turbolasers, the bomb racks and the flamethrower) all seemed to be controlled from the pilots seat. As he turns the the sensor readings, he sees that they are nearly overwhelmed with readouts (the ship is standing pretty much next to the force field after all), but it does seem like the small terminal Ava had spotted earlier was used to control the energy flow.
As the ship lifts from the ground and rocks heavily, the Mandalorian warrior vanishes from Lorn´s sight and shortly after, he hears a muffled groan, and the sound of armor hitting floor.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-08-26 14:05:17)

A roaring cloud of fire erupts from underneath the rear of the ship. From the cockpit however, it is hard to determine any effect. On the other hand, Lorn , on the other hand, is perfectly positioned to see the flames roll out, and cause a couple of the onrushing soldiers to dive to the ground for cover. Unfortunately, the flames soar above them, and also fails to reach the set up E-Web, and a new series of shots is heard banging into the ships hull.
Moments later though, the ship sounds with power as the forward-mounted turbolasers are fired. The powerful weapons reduces the small station in the hangar´s corner to slag, as well as taking a chunk of the wall with it. In moments, the ships sensor readings starts to show fluctuations in the force field, and both Ava and SG can see the power of the field begin to fail. From out the loading ramp, Lorn can see the soldiers scrambling to secure themselves, either by trying to get out of there or finding something to hold on to before the field vanishes completely.

"Aim lower, Ava!" Lorn calls out as the fire rolls over the Mandos' heads.

In the very first moments of the flight into outer space, everyone expects pursuit to come almost instant, but it appears the Mandalorians have more...pressing...matters to deal with back in the hangar.
Uninterrupted by pursuing fighters, SG easily evades a few stray turbolaser blasts sent in their direction, and shortly the group makes the jump to hyperspace. A few hours later, they arrive safely back at Republic command.
((That concludes part 1 of Chapter II))

As soon as they are in hyperspace, Lorn lets his guard down for the first time in endless weeks. He settles down onto the deck and closes his eyes, letting himself rest, truly rest. He reaches out into the Force and explores the ship around him, taking a tour without ever leaving his seat.
(Force Perception +7, I'm just looking to see whatever I can find)
As their trip comes to a close, lorn finds himself relieved--and oddly apprehensive--about returning to a Republic stronghold. He settles into the cockpit as they make their way in, taking calming breaths and letting his nervousness vanish into the Force,

Ava moves to the rearhold of the ship, looking sullen. She approaches the damage left by Lorn's saber and gently traces it with her hand, before slumping to the floor, her back to the hatch. Her knees pulled in tight against her chest, she fiddles with her lightsaber, seemingly completely disconnected from reality.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-09-02 19:26:00)

As Lorn reaches out with the Force he feels...nothing. Well, maybe something, such as the others on board. But the ship is a machine, and while it has been heard of Jedi that was able to even sense droids and other machinations in the Force, such skill is till far beyond Lorn.
==============================================
After a (luckily) uneventful journey back to Republic Command, and a good nights sleep and rest, Lorn and Ava are summoned into a briefing room. As they enter the room, they spots no one in particular that seems familiar, except for a Zabrak wearing tan robes who appears somewhat familiar to both of them. Upon seeing them, he stands, and motions towards two empty seats.
"Welcome, padawans. I am master Kooth Aan, Jedi Watchman of Iridonia and the Zabrak colonies...or was until very recently"
You can clearly see that something is troubling the Jedi master.

Ava nods in Kranth's direction before pointing herself and Lorn in succession with her thumb.

"Master Aan, I take it the Mandalorian have struck the Iridonian Sector, or is it something else entirely?"

Analis steps out of a doorway, his cloak showing he has something long over his shoulder. Then nods at Ava, Lorn, and Kranth.
"I guess its time for introductions then. Im Analis, bounty hunter extraordinaire, at your service."
Then turning to look at the Jedi master.
"Ya, are we hunting Mandos or something else? Also, any chance of payment out of this or will this be volunteer work?"

---

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-09-04 03:49:14)

The Zabrak looks at Ava and nods with a heavy head.
"Given your recent captivity, it is understandable that you have not heard. Iridonia and the Zabrak colonies have fallen before the Mandalorians. Apart from the tragic nature of the event in itself, this has cost the Republic a highly important position on the Rim"
As Analis enters the room as well, the Zabrak shifts his gaze to him.
"Ah, the final member of the team has arrived. Please, take a seat"

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **Tempeste** (2009-09-04 06:09:16)

Kranth angles his head slightly as he looks down at the Zabrak, "The Mandalorians have no honour, they attack civilians and try to destroy anyone who opposes them but we will stand.. We will show them what true honour is." He then turns to face the bounty hunter, "I hope you have as much honour as I, and that your loyalty is true." With this he steps backwards, feeling he's said enough.

Lorn stays quiet, lingering by Ava's side and letting her introduce him. He watches the new guys, trying to get some sense of them. The small, red-skinned Kel Dor, folds his arms over his chest as he turns from one to the next, closely examining them with his goggled eyes.
As Kooth Aan makes note of what happened to Iridonia, Lorn nods. "The Mandos are determined to win this war," he points out to Kranth. His voice is deep and breathy, distorted slightly by the breath mask he wears. "They will do whatever they must to win. We must hope the Force has other plans."

---

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-09-04 16:53:26)

Master Aan seats himself again and looks at Kranth.
"The Mandalorians have honor, padawan. But their definition of honor differs from yours or mine. They respect strength above all else, and this is why they goad the Republic to take action. They want to meet us straight on, in a contest of pure strength. Unfortunately for us, we would lose such a contest, and so we must resort to other strategies. But do not mistake them for honorless savages"
Taking a moment to look over the group now seated, he clears his throat.
"The loss of Iridonia is a heavy blow for us, and command is preparing a massive effort to retake the Zabrak colonies even as we speak. This is where you come in. Launching a warfleet straight into the system would be suicide, and cause causalities of catastrophic proportions. No, we need to strike them from within, and disrupt their defenses, before any fleet action can be attempted.
Using the transport you brought back from your captivity, you must sneak into the system and land on the surface of Iridonia. From there, you must try to sabotage their hold of the planet and their capacity to defend it as much as possible"

### **Tempeste** (2009-09-07 18:13:52)

Kranth stays silent until the Master has spoken, and then he contemplates his words, clearly in thought. He breathes deeply, and then speaks, "Master, I'm sure you understand my ideologies.. I believe if we strike them in such a way it would be to reduce ourselves to their level. Is this why I was assigned here, a test of some sort? I'm sorry but I won't be ambushing anyone, any fighting I do will be honourable and head on.. Though I feel I would still be of use." Kranth finishes now, clearly unsettled by something which is obviously important to him.

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

Looking at Kranth, Analis says "Gorilla warfare is the same as a straight up fight except you don't die as fast. Besides, we will still be in plenty of fights and ambush or not there will be enough straight fights to satisfy your honor. Something to remember though is a Mando will shoot you in the back just as fast as he will in the chest if you give him a chance."
Turning to look at the Master, "I agree with Ava though, sending three Padawans and a bounty hunter seems like a bit of a small force. On the other hand, it sounds like it will be a fun vacation. I could probably get a good discount on a suit of Mando body armor while we are there."

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-09-07 19:35:37)

"I don´t believe you will be having a vacation. What little reports we have managed to gather indicates that the Mandalorians realizes the strategic position on the Rim, and intend to defend it well"
Hearing many voices of concern being spoken, he looks out over the group.
"The Jedi are not warriors, we are guardians. You are not being sent to slaughter soldiers by the millions, you are being sent to rouse the resistance, to sabotage their fleets, and to disrupt their defenses so that the fleet can move in. Stealth will be your ally, not strength"
His eyes growing harder, he continues.
"We are at war, make no mistake. We must do what is necessary, and we must not hesitate. But we must also not give in to our fear, or hate. Not fighting an enemy up front doesn´t mean you have to stab him in the back, when you can just as well avoid him altogether. But when the time comes that the choice is not yours to make anymore, your response must be swift and decisive, or you will fail. If you have no further questions, you should prepare for the journey"

"I do not fear our enemy. But I feel the only way to defeat the Mandalorians is by showing the same agression as they have shown us. I will gladly lead a resistance into battle, but my form is not exactly inconspicious, they will easily recognise me after they've seen me the first time.." Kranth stops again before turning to face the Bounty Hunter, he looks down.
"I'm not sure your profession has the greatest idea on the concept of honour. But I hope you soon learn you're fighting for something much more valuable than credits here." Satisfied, Kranth bows and leaves to prepare for the trip.

Kranth's words rang in Lorn's ears. *I feel the only way to defeat the Mandalorians is by showing the same aggression as they have shown us.* Aggression . . . that led to the dark side and it had led to so many deaths on Myrkyr. Did he not see that? Of course he didn't . . . he hadn't been there.
He hurried out of the room after Kranth, grasping his arm when he got within reach. "The aggression they have shown us doesn't work against them," he said. "We tried that on Myrkyr and we came across that in their prison. If we had faced them head on we never would have survived. This *has* to be the way we do things if we want to win this war."
*To win this war . . .*  Was that all this was about now?

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **Tempeste** (2009-09-08 19:40:05)

"They won't respond to diplomacy, Agression is our only option," replied Kranth in a somewhat sombre tone. "We will win this war when their leader lies dead at our feet.. We can't break their back but we can cut off their head.." Deciding whether or not to continue his point -Kranth felt he had already said enough this day- he opened his mouth, "I do not know how we will defeat our foe, but I know we shall. And we shall do it whilst keeping our Honour and Integrity intact."

As you enter the hangar, you can spot the stolen transport standing to the side. As you approaches it, a human woman dressed in a Republic uniform meets you.
"So, you are the team that is supposed to take this thing behind enemy lines? Can´t say I envy you. Sure, it is a nice ship and all, but I´d rather fly something that I knew offered me an escape path if things got ugly. Where´d you pick up that ship anyway?"

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **Anonymous** (2009-09-13 03:26:23)

Ava sullenly looks at the ship, a vivid reminder of all those who had been lost, many killed before her eyes. Some she could barely remember, probably because she didn't want to remember, but one name stood our. Lor; he had fought with them, he had been captured with them, but where the Miraluka was now, no one could say. He was probably dead and all Ava could think about was how it was unfair. Why had she lived when nearly everyone else had died?
The officer's voice snapped her back to reality and she caught only the woman's question.
"We stole it... while fleeing a Mandolorian ship."
Fleeing. That was pretty much the only thing she had done before the onset of this "adventure". Oh, sure she had killed a mando or two, but that left her only with a bitter feeling and didn't make all the deaths any more bearable. Perhaps if she had no fled, if she had not thought only of herself, she could have saved them?

---

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-09-13 04:02:41)

The officer looks at Ava, and then back at the ship.
"Well, you should be thankful that you weren´t pursued. While this ship is something of the sturdiest I´ve seen, she doesn´t have any escape pods. Guess it´s the way of those Mandalorians, either come in blazing in glory, or you don´t come in at all"
She checks over the group of the five people in front of her, her eyes lingering a little longer on the massive Gen'dai.
"Anyway, we´ve prepared the ship for launch, and programmed the coordinates for Iridonia into the navcomputer. The ship also contains clearance codes that should ensure that you can land safely on the planet without much trouble. Unfortunately, we´ve been unable to extract the codes from it to use them for confusing Mandalorian targeting systems for the fleet, but at least you should be safe.
If there was nothing else, then I suggest you get going. Command has given you three days before the rest of the fleet arrives, and on behalf of me and my men, I´d like to ask you to create as much chaos as possible until then. May the Force be with you all"

"No escape pods? Why did you have to tell me? Now we are going to be in space, without enough guns, with a Mando fleet breathing down our necks, and there are no escape pods. How could this get any worse?"
Analis says to himself as he walks to the ship, looking a bit more jumpy.

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **Anonymous** (2009-09-16 23:41:32)

No escape pods. Well, that was all right. If the Mandos wanted to kill them, escape pods wouldn't stop them.
Lorn didn't break stride as he strode right up into the ship and looked around. He settled into the co-pilot's seat nervously, trying hard not to let it show. Yeah, he and Ava had just gotten out of Mando territory, but they were Jedi. This is what they did. He leaned back in his chair and went through the breathing exercises Master Antilles had taught him, hoping they would calm his suddenly jumpy nerves.

Without further delay, the group loads up in the ship, and with Analis at the helm (since he is the only one who knows how to fly a ship) they makes the jump to hyperspace, aiming for Iridonian space. The trip goes uneventfully and in the meanwhile, you decides to explore the ship a bit.
The ship is extremely sturdily built, boasting a thick exterior armor plating of extreme durability as well as a massive shield system. Like the technician told you though, it lacks escape pods. From what you can derive the ship is designed to be a short range transport designed to set troops down in the heat of combat. It has an advanced thruster system for performing quick maneuvers, and in addition to the weapon systems you already discovered, there are two cannon turrets placed on each side of the ship. It also carries a highly advanced jamming array, capable of blocking even capital ship weapons. Whatever its purpose, it seems the ship is on the cutting edge of technological advancement in the Mandalorian fleet.
Finally the ship pops out of hyperspace into the Iridonian system. The space is filled with ships of various sizes and shapes, and you notices that a substantial portion of the Mandalorian fleet has been stationed here.

After a few moments of silence, the voice in the other end of the comm line speaks up again.
"Roger that. Your codes checks out, you are clear to land. We will transfer you the coordinates to our detention camps right away"
In a few more moments, Analis finds a set of surface coordinates up loaded to the navigation systems, and he starts to bring the ship in.

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-10 14:57:33)

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-14 16:15:48)

As the transport moves in over the planet, following the given trajectory, you can spot a single large settlement which you assumes is the capitol city Wortan. The course you follow brings you a few kilometers away from the city though, and as you go down for landing, you get a closer look at the ground. There appears to be several camps of sorts, and you can see Mandalorian soldiers as well as Zabrak, and from the looks of it, the camps are training camps.
Finding a good and somewhat discrete clearing, you settle the ship down. So far, so good, but there is a pretty good chance someone saw you fly in, so you might be getting company soon.

As soon as the ship touched down, Lorn was on his feet. He glanced briefly in Ava's direction, then strode toward the exit ramp, not waiting for those behind him.

As you walks down the ramp, cautiously, you can see that you have landed at the outskirts of a wide field, shielded by some hills. Judging from what you spotted going down, there seems to be some sort of training field not far from here, but you can see no one at the moment.

He glanced back at Kranth, then shrugged. "I'm not sure if he's coming, so let's go. He can catch up." Without another word, he strode off across the ground, but avoiding the training field.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-11-05 11:19:32)

A few quick steps brings Lorn and Ava up near the summit of the hill, providing a better view of the surroundings. They can see that the wide plains they have landed on stretches on for miles in every direction, broken only by smaller hills, like the one they are now standing on, and small patches of trees. A few kilometers away, they spot the training field they flew in over, but it is too far away to make out anything. At least they cannot see any transports or personnel headed in their direction.
Further away in the distance, a few miles away, they can see the large settlement of Wortan.

Kranth appeared beside the two, "We should try to find out anything we can about the mandalorian prescence. We may be able to pinpoint a weakness somewhere.." He looked over the hills and then the settlement. "But we should keep our weapons hidden for now.. As much as I dislike the idea."

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-11-09 19:33:21)

Without any disturbance, Lorn, Ava and Kranth starts to walk across the widespread plains. The walk is long, and with the precautions they take for not being spotted, it will likely take several hours to complete. But their goal, the capitol of Wortan, is steadily coming closer.

---

## Re: Chapter II: Wildfire

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-01-23 04:22:03)

After several hours of walking, the three Jedi apprentices reaches the outskirts of the city Wortan, the Iridonian capital. They proceed with caution, and manages to find a secure (or at least empty) spot to watch the city from in the form of a small cliff in the upper level of the city. While they have remained undisturbed so far, they still have the feeling that if the wrong person takes one bad look at them, their cover will be blown. The planet is mainly populated by Zabrak, and any non-Zabrak (especially ones as noteworthy as Gen'dai) will most likely be the focus of too much attention.
While the life in the city seems to go on as usual, there is no doubt that Wortan is an occupied city, and Mandalorian soldiers can be seen both here and there.
