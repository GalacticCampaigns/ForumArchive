<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Ka&#39;ra Bralor</span> (kah rah), Mandalorian mercenary
Hired by Captain Prius and her informant, Lanius, Ka'ra was responsible for bringing most of the starting members onto the *Titan's Valiant* with the promise of worth while work. Ka'ra is the group's liaison with the *Titan's Valiant* and its captain.
Though she is young, appearing no more than seventeen years, she seems to carry the mantle of responsibility placed on her well.
Her armor is of an unusual design, made of a strong metal which could theoretically stop a lightsaber. It's only distinguishable feature is the T shaped visor on the helmet, otherwise it could pass as a form of regular light armor. It was obviously made custom for her by the close fit to her form. (It looks like the armor used by the Mandalorians during the later eras, unlike the Neo Crusader armor.) Underneath her helmet, Ka'ra has short red hair, her blue eyes looking on with a sharp intelligence. She stands near the average height of 5'5" and though she looks lightweight, she is stronger than she appears.<div style="text-align: left;">

</div>

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Tentia</span> the Strill. Ka'ra's companion
With it's flabby brown skin and black patches, its pervasive stench makes one wonder if Tentia is the reason Ka'ra keeps her helmet on all the time. If it wasn't for its distinct odor, Tentia would be very good at moving around unnoticed. A fierce protector of its master, Tentia is never far from Ka'ra's side
A strill is the traditional Mandalorian hunting animal, both tenacious in pursuit of prey and very loyal. They are also quite clever, and their intelligence and tenacity, combined with their flying/gliding ablities, enable strills to follow a quarry into and through places where many trackers cannot or will not go. However they are not for everyone. Even some Mando'ade dislike the creatures due to their savage reputation, unkempt appearance and offensive musky odor.
Strills are 6 legged furry mammals with sharp claws and an oversized fang-filled mouth. They are about 1 meter long, plus a whiplike tail. The furred hide hangs in loose folds most of the time, which accounts for much of its ugly look. When taking to the air, the skin stretches between the limbs and body to allow it to glide or even fly. The deep skin folds make it difficult for a strill to groom itself clean--or presumably for an owner to do so. Dirt, oil and skin bacteria therefore remain in the folds. This dirt accumulation, natural musk production and constant drooling (possibly due to so many teeth crowded into the mouth) contribute to a strill's terribly unpleasant aroma.
Strills are monoecious (hermaphroditic) mammals, although it is not clear whether they mate, self-fertilize or both. It is known that strills make elaborate nests and hunt just before giving birth. They are said to be able to sense when other species are about to give birth. The lifespan of a strill is several times that of a human (or other common Mando'ade species). Therefore, a strill owner will make provisions for her companion to be passed on to a caring new master/mistress, usually a family member or close friend. However, a Mando'ad will offer future ownership to a more distant aquaintance if that person shows interest or affection toward his companion.

<div style="text-align: right;">
![DremminKol_400.jpg](http://i757.photobucket.com/albums/xx212/SketchpadStudio/DremminKol_400.jpg)
</div>

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Dremmin Kol**</span>
***Adventurous Scholar***
**Homeworld:** Corellia
**Background:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Spending summers with his Uncle Gym was one of the most exhilarating things about Dremmin's childhood. While most of his classmates were out at camp, or learning a trade, he was off exploring worlds with his uncle and his crew aboard the Lookabout, a medium freighter and hyperspace trailblazer. As he grew older, his father had hoped the youth would follow in his footsteps, but it was already too late; Dremmin had already decided what he wanted to do with his life. During his academy years, he studied hyperspace routes and the various lore of mythical civilizations, taking on additional classes in survival and mechanics when he could. By the time he'd graduated, Dremmin was within the top ten percent of his class and ready to head into the dangerous coils of the Unknown Regions.
But not everything was as smooth as he expected. His parents, who helped him with his schooling, wanted him to stay home and work as a teacher. His uncle, who he'd hoped to sign on with, hadn't been heard from in years after taking a supply run into the Outer Rim. So, looking for an escape, he jumped the first ship leaving the Core Worlds, and managed to eventually pick up work with the Republic Astrogation Survey Team for a few years. Working as an independent guide these days, Dremmin keeps the glowstick lit for his uncle and hopes to one day delve into the mystery of his disappearance.

</details>

**Personality:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Dremmin is an adventurer first and foremost. While a bit cocky and impulsive, he's also very knowledgeable and capable in most situations, including combat. In the field, he expects anyone under his guidance to listen to him and do as they're told. In this past, this hasn't mixed well with clients, but most come to realize their error when falling into a rancor graveyard or stumbling across a narglatch lair. Dremmin isn't outwardly organized, often leaving piles of "sorted" mess behind him as he works on a route or reading about a legend. But he also isn't a slob either, often noting that the messes he leaves are there "for a reason". And, while he doesn't have the greatest relationship with most of his relatives, he has a driving need to find his uncle and help him in any way that he can.

</details>

**Appearance:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Dremmin is average height with a slightly athletic build for a human male in his mid-20s. He has scruffy, auburn hair that's a bit shaggy and stretches down into long, unkempt sideburns, and brown eyes. His typical style of dress is that of a field scout, often sporting a dark jacket, nondescript shirts, multi-pocketed slacks and thick boots, but he's also been known to "clean up good" when he needs to.

*Gridd, Dug Spice Smuggler [CL 2]:* In the old days, Gridd worked with Uncle Gym on a few scouting jobs. But, after some time, Gridd wanted a bit more for himself, so he gave up the scouting life and became a smuggler. During the summers that Dremmin spent with his uncle, he'd gotten to know Gridd and could count on him in a tight spot.
*Gilda Gold, Pop Holostar [CL 1]:* During one of Dremmin's early adventures, he'd met Gilda when he was sent into Felucia after her ship had made an emergency landing. While no one else survived, Dremmin was able to recover the starlet, who was *quite happy* to have been rescued. While their "relationship" has been strained, she would gladly help him again if it meant she could see him.

Windar Luvis CL4: A military supplier turned arm sealer, Windar is an old friend of Kin's who served with him in the republic military for a time. He changed career into supplying weapons for the military and then for anyone who would pay him. Kin doesn't approve of the profit focused change of heart but Windar is one of the few people in the galaxy who he trusts. Windar is a pale skinned, red haired Cerean a couple of years older than Kin. He's never been one to contemplate morality but tries to be honest with friends and those who have helped him. His arms dealing trade earns him a nice amount of credits, and of course he gets access to information others could find important.

</details>

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Kin Var grew up in the shadow of a military family with the previous generations being proud fighters for the republic, his family name even belonged to a few jedi in the past. He himself became nothing more than a soldier however, serving in the republic. His early career passed without incident, only after he joined the military did things take a turn for the worst. Kin served as a marine in the Republic Navy, defending against boarding parties and taking part in them too. He quickly grew attached to the flechette launcher which exelled in such close quarters.
The outbreak of the mandalorian war ensured Kin saw his fair share of the action. He also fell in love with a Nautolan named Kara, she was a pilot and he would always be there to meet her after a mission if possible. The battle of Iridonia didn't go well for the ship they were stationed on, the fighting crippled it badly and whole sections of the craft fell towards the planet below, one had Kin within it. He never found out the true fate of Kara but he knew inside she must have died, no other survivors from the ship or her squadron were ever found. The 'landing' on the planet had nearly broken his mind as well as his body. His right arm was beyond all medical science and replaced with a military standard cybernetic limb. The crash also left his eyes horribly damaged and they were replaced, though they were much harder to spot as being synthetic.
Kin continued to fight for the Republic once he healed, it didn't feel like it used to however. He'd lost everything dear to him and began to take almost suicidal risks. Charging towards enemy firebases or standing in front of incoming fire to shield an ally. Comrades remark how it seems he wants death to take him and dares it to at every oppertunity.

</details>

**Appearance:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Kin is clearly a veteran of combat, his face his scarred and his cybernetic limb is visibly mechanical. His eyes look organic however, and it'd probably take a doctor to discover their synthetic manufacture. His head tendrils are kept bare and Kin is about average height for his race, being 1.8 metres tall. He's now in his late twenties with little to show apart from his scars and broken body. He typically wears simple clothes, preferring to keep his arms bare and clothes loose. His cybernetic arm has a dull metallic finish which has been coloured with camoflauge paints in the past.

**Background:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Alarick always had plenty of money as a kid and had the biggest and greatest toys any kid could want but he always liked trying to make his own things. This desire grew as he got older, however his mother never like him trying to build things. At the age of thirteen his mother left him and his father due to the fact that his father spent all his time trying to make his company better. This freed up the only barrier that was keeping him out of the factory. Alarick was the youngest employ at the age of fourteen after proving that he could build a better weapon than on of the top R&D techs, however he was not allowed to join the R&D due to the fact that the military would not allow a child to work on their projects.
As Alarick grew older he took more and more interest in weapons, armor, and prosthesis manufacturing. To satisfy that thirst of knowledge he joined the R&D section of his fathers factory, now renown for its innovative weapons, armor, and prosthesis ideas. Alarick quickly learned how to design weapons that worked better without cutting back on the quality of the weapon. After Alarick learned how deal with other companies and was moved out of R&D and into a position to help deal with other companies but he still spent all his free time in the R&D labs. By the age of 26 Alarick realized that there were many things he needed to learn in order to make even better equipment, that on top of the fact that he wanted to make a name for himself spurned his motivation to make his own company, explore the galaxy, and learn all that he could. He intends to find out what it is people, and possibly the military, need so he can make a better company than his fathers.

**Description:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Alarick is about two meters tall and weighs about 82 kg. He has short brown hair and his white suite allows him to stand out in a room. Along with his rings and custom weapons his wealth is easily shown. Most people don't know his eye color due to the fact that he's always wearing his sunglasses.

**Background:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Fiolla was but a baby when she was given up by her family and given over to the Jedi Order, to be taught the ways of the Force. It was under the tutelage of Jedi Instructors and together with other younglings near her own age that she spent her childhood, receiving instruction in basic uses of the force.
At the age of 12 she was deemed ready and was allowed to become a padawan, yet it wasn't until the age of 14 that she found a master or perhaps rather her master found her. Master Seedan Tamory, a human Jedi Knight on the verge of becoming Jedi Master took her as his Padawan Learner. Naster Seedan was a great master, providing Fiolla with plenty of opportunity to pursue her own interests (leaving Tamory to focus on her own interest in mechanics), while still providing support and guidance, teaching the young Padawan about life, the Force and the ways of the Jedi.
A few years and several missions later the Master and Padawan found themselves enroute to the temple on Dantooine when the Sith made their move on the Jedi Order and in the end Master Seedan ended up giving herself to the Force, but her sacrifice allowed Fioalla to escape. She was able to sneak aboard a cargo ship leaving Dantooine, unseen by Sith scouts and went to the moon Nar Shadda, where she was able to survive unseen.
As the months passed on the Smuggler's Moon, Fiolla started to grow a bit disillusioned. Her Master was dead and from the random rumors she picked up, the Jedi Order was no more. She was alone and did not know what to do, never knowing freedom. And the more her despair grew, the harder she found it to focus on using the force to help others, taking care of their wounds. Until one particularly rough day, where she suddenly found herself unable to transfer her own life force, her soul having been tainted by the anger growing within her, about the injustice done to her and the Jedi Order, despite knowing that such thoughts was on the path to the Dark Side.
One particularly frustrating day Fiolla found herself together with one of her few friends, Karmyzz, of a race that Fiolla didn't recognize and never questioned him about. After being hit by a stray shot from some strangers fighting a group of gangers, all without any thought to the innocent bystanders. Fiolla's first thought was to stop their fight, but then she realized just how badly hurt Karmyzz was. She tried to heal him, but at first she failed, but as she grew more frustrated, she grew more angry too and it was from this she found the strength and through rage literally ordered the wounds to close up and so they did.
Once everything calmed down, she had time to think about things and she found herself confused and lost. She had always been told that the Dark Side was bad, instructors, masters, other padawan learners, even as younglings, they were warned about the Dark Side and the destruction it could cause, yet now she found that opening herself to such emotions could heal just the same as the light side.
It took a few days of constant confusion, before she finally decided that despite the dangers, she would need to seek out someone with more knowledge of the force. She hoped for a Jedi Master, someone who had survived, but she would be satisfied with anyone more understanding of the Force and its mysteries.
With the few credits she had saved, she booked passage off Nar Shadda and started her journey through the Galaxy. Her journey led her to a few force users, some knowing a few others and guiding her to those, before she finally found herself in contact with Lanius, who took her under his wings after deeming that she was not unredeemable.
One of the friends of her new Master is a Mandalorian named Ka'ra. When Lanius from time to time goes to do his own business, Fiolla works with this Mandalorian woman. This time however Lanius has sent Fiolla to work with Ka'ra on a special mission.

Emily has never really known a time when life wasn’t hard, having been on her own for several years, although she is very close mouthed about what exactly happened to her parents. Their absence caused her to have to grow up faster, and become a bit of a survivor, fortunately she always had a knack with computers (even given her young age having only just turned 14 years old), which has made her very useful to various people that have found her skills to be quite handy in questionable activities. Emily's talents extend to more then just computers, her time on her own lead to her developing a very broad set of skills useful when you are trying to survive and make it on your own especially at such a young age.
Surprisingly she has never actually been on planet, having lived her entire life in space, either on various space stations, or on starships traveling too and from them. She doesn’t really think she is missing out on much, but she also probably doesn’t realise how beautiful planets can be only having heard of them second hand.
She met up with Ka’ra about a week ago, and the Mandalorian seems to have taken a liking to her (even if she can’t really understand why).

</details>

**Description**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Emily is a pretty human girl that looks like she couldn't be much older than thirteen or fourteen, she is roughly 4 feet 8 inches tall, with a slim build and can't weigh more than eighty pounds, with vibrant sea-green eyes, and straight deep red hair flowing down to a little passed her shoulders. She is wearing a white flight-suit that doesn't restrict her movements very much.

**Character Description:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Physical Description:**
Sajin bears the pale white skin, straight black hair, and gaunt features that is the hallmark of the Nagai race. He tends to favor garb that contrasts with his ghostly countenance, further enhancing the disquieting nature of his gold-eyed gaze. Although Sajin wears his hair long and free-flowing, he is quite meticulous, taking exceptional care of his appearance and belongings.
**Personality:**
Focused, disciplined, and aloof. Sajin maintains an air of quiet contemplation and detachment amongst groups of people, even those considered his associates. But simmering beneath the surface of his quiet demeanor is an enjoyment of battle and danger that has sometimes given way to something much darker...
**Traits and Flaws:**
Diligent and direct, Sajin takes great care in making sure his actions are very precise. He holds to a strict code of personal honor and obligation. And even though most find him aloof, Sajin displays a morbid (some would say "cruel" ) sense of humor.
Honor-bound to a fault, Sajin will hold to his word even at great personal risk and risk to others. The Nagaian holds some personal secret that drives him to honor his every word and deed.

</details>

**Character Background:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**One year before the end of the Mandalorian War**
**"So you're just going to leave?"
"I do not have a choice. Master Nondo says Rhuk may never walk again. I've brought much shame upon myself, and I do not want it to fall upon you."**
The Echani woman hugged the Nagaian's back to her, half-embrace and half-restraining grasp. Sajin stood frozen in his tracks, the duffel bag in his hand shaking as he willed himself to maintain his hold on it. Willed himself to not turn and comfort the woman at his back.
**"You are having a choice! You always are having a choice, you're just always so nerf-brained stubborn!"**
**"Xiaya, honor demands- "**
Xiaya released the man, grabbing his wrist to stare intently into his eyes. Unbridled fury replaced the desperation of her tone before, as she wagged a finger a mere centimeter away from his unflinching stare.
**"It is always 'the Honor' this and 'the Honor' that. We of the Echani know of Honor! We also know of the Dance; of the music the souls make when entwined! Why do you torture yourself so?"**
Sajin broke Xiaya's grip on his wrist, spinning her about and using the maneuver to draw her to him. All of the anger and bluster she had shone just a moment before fled just as quickly as it came, replaced with silent sobs.
**"You are more honorable and gracious than any I have ever met before… And I love you for it. This is why I must go; the masters forbade our union, yet still I persisted. I will not have my weakness stifle what greatness you may yet attain."
"It is being *our* weakness!"**
The Nagaian slowly turned the woman to face him, one long, pale finger straying to her cheek to wipe away a tear. Xiaya nuzzled against the finger, but Sajin allowed it to drop as he regained his grip on his duffel and turned to leave.
**"Honor demands…"
"…And the Force wills. We will see each other again; when I am worthy enough of you, and the Order."**
Without a second-glance, Sajin marched out of the small Jedi dormitory the silky partition that served as a door swaying in his wake. Xiaya looked to her hands, one last crystalline tear trailing from his eyelashes and raining to the barren floor. She held a Tehk'la blade, a viciously-serrated short blade crafted by the Nagai as ancestral weapons, and regarded as their most prized possession. The full weight of what the gift meant struck the Echani, and she raced to the doorway, only to find no sign of Sajin, only the swaying of the silk curtain.
**************************************
*Amidst the ruins of the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine*
**"What news have you from WatchCircle Odan-Urr?"**
The two cloaked figures sat around the blast-scorched stump of one of the Enclave's support pillars, deep within its ruins. Between them sat the sparse remains of a brief lunch and several datapads, each streaming reports from Jedi Covenant agents from across the galaxy.
**"The War Sword of Ludo Kressh was successfully recovered, and is currently being cataloged for study. Master Nondo has brought in a new recruit he believes to be a very promising candidate for the Shadows."**
Taking one of datapads from the many scattered across the makeshift table, the shrouded Jedi master passed the device to his compatriot, the faint light filtering through the ruins flashing off a blue-complected hand.
**"Sajin Tae, hm? Promising, yet I sense a… lingering darkness about him. Are we sure about this one Endres? Many of these artifacts would resonant with such a darkness, and we already walk the razor's edge- "**
**"And it is because our balance is so precarious that we must use every hand at our disposal! The Order teeters on the brink of collapse and the presence of the dark side grows ever stronger! We shall teach him to master his rage and utilize it for our greater cause. I will not have a repeat of Taris or Dantooine because we were fearful of our duties!"**
Although it is a spoken in a hushed tone, the rebuke is no less fervent. The figure gestures around the devastated Enclave, emphasizing particularly blasted and warped wreckage where once stood grand testaments to the Jedi Order. The other master takes a long look around the ruins in silence, before his head dips in a nod.
**"You need not lecture me, I know the importance of what we do. Very well then, I've a lead on a retrieval through one of our contacts in the Republic. The task should prove most suitable to young Sajin's skillset…"**
Muted daylight faded into night as the two discussed the mission's logistics. Objectives and mission parameters were transmitted to an unknown location via an encrypted channel, then the two Covenant Masters departed to resume the more mundane business of the Jedi Order.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Lanius</span>
In his early twenties, this young man stands just under two meters. Regarding his surroundings with a wary eye, he initially seems distrustful or ill at ease with new circumstances. The dark robes he wears make a sharp contrast with his light blonde hair. At his belt a lightsaber swings visibly beside a blaster pistol.
Lanius serves as one of Jut-hakk's lieutenants. Placed in charge of maintaining the outpost at Telia V he has been researching various Force artifacts including the Force Harvester. After discovering Jut-hakks aims, he sought to put an end to it with the help of Ka'ra and Niandra Prius.

Description <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Tanith is 29 years old, 1.6 meters tall, and weighs 60 kilos. His dark hair is starting to grey at the temples, and his brown eyes are troubled- betraying the things he’s seen and the depth of his thoughts. Beneath his armor, his body is a wiry and scarred testament to the wars he’s seen. His armor is patched, faded, and well worn, as are his pistols. His helmet is more flexible leather than plasteel, with a face mask containing the life support and high tech goggles. He owns a used L.I. AeroChaser speeder bike, as beaten and patched as his armor.

</details>

Personality <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Tanith is an idealist who has been tempered by experience and war. He believes in the Republic, but not its government or its Jedi protectors. He goes to great lengths to enjoy himself, hoping to avoid the torturous thoughts and memories brought on by boredom.

</details>

Background <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

At the age of eighteen Tanith Hoagra joined the Republic Army in response to the call for forces to fight in the Mandalorian Wars. He served as a technician, working as a mechanic and engineer. He learned a great deal from a brilliant Zabrak named Bao-Dur while serving under the Jedi general who became the Exile. This was where he lost his faith in the Jedi. The General’s order to activate the Mass Shadow Generator killed as many of her own troops as it did Mandalorians. Tanith could see that it had affected her, she seemed half dead afterwards. Rumors on the ship said she had lost the Force. Later he learned she had been exiled by the Jedi Council. That she had returned to face their judgment was her only redeeming trait in Tanith’s eyes.
After the Mandalorian Wars and Malachor V, he saw the war in a different light. He saw the way Jedi leaders had thrown troops away because they didn’t understand tactics. He began to understand most of their losses could be laid at the feet of their commanders. The disaster at Serroco was an example. What the Mandalorians did was reprehensible, but whatever fool had made the decision to barrack the Republic forces in the civilian centers was equally to blame. With his faith the Republic government and Jedi shattered, he left the Army.
When the newly christened Darth Revan made his presence known by attacking the Republic, Tanith felt even more betrayed and confused. His love of the Republic’s people made him join the Navy, and Revan’s betrayal served to deepen his distrust of Jedi. While he agreed with the Sith’s intentions, he saw war as unnecessary and needless. He flew in several battles as a fighter pilot. After the Battle of Rakata Prime, Tanith learned of Revan’s role in the final months of the war. Tanith couldn’t understand why the man was never brought up on charges. Only his status as a Jedi prevented it, which troubled Tanith greatly. His disgust with the Republic’s favoritism of Jedi and the Jedi’s wars ravaging the galaxy he loved drove him to abandon the Navy.
After leaving the military he made his way through the galaxy earning his keep as a pilot, mercenary, and racer. He found he was too scrupulous to maintain regular employment as a mercenary, not taking contracts that contradicted with his conscious. The same went for the piloting jobs he had found. He wouldn’t transport slaves or weapons, and didn’t care much for smuggling, save for things he considered harmless. He supplemented his income with bodyguard work, his mechanic skills, and swoop racing. He couldn’t afford a drag bike, but his used L.I. AeroChaser was great for round track races. He had more or less settled on Nar Shadda, having befriended a Duros innkeeper named Lai Teebo. Lai provided him a room and meals for free in exchange for Tanith acting as a bouncer when things became rough. Lai also kept him informed on lucrative jobs, as well as providing a pipeline to the black market, mostly chop-shops and smugglers. An old friend from the wars has also set up on Nar Shadda: a Herglic weapons dealer named Stavros Udo. He met the massive weapons and armor smith as Stavros travelled the frontlines and ships, plying his wares to Republic soldiers. Stavros has used Tanith on many supply and buying runs, and to keep his ship in good repair. In return, he offers fair prices and easily accessible wares Tanith would otherwise have trouble finding, as well as storage for Tanith’s bike when off-planet.

Tendau has a quick wit and always enjoys a good laugh. His love of all things living has him mindful of what repercussions his actions have on not only himself, but those affected by his decisions.

Annok Dustiak:Cerean Jedi Historian. Annok is a very old librarian from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Annok was a key mentor for Tendau as he was training at the temple. Providing many resources for his advancement in both the Jedi and scholarly pursuits he followed. He had access to special lightsaber parts, rare holocrons, as well as training regiments and implements for those regiments (like training remotes for saber practice). Annok is older and while he was never much more than a mediocre combatant, he excelled at negotiations and scholoraly pursuits which leant to his skill as a Jedi archivist. Since the conclusion of the Jedi Civil War he has gone into hiding because of the threats facing those openly calling themselves Jedi. CL 5

</details>

**Backstory**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Tendau was but a child padawan when his Master Dekel followed Revan to halt the Mandolorian crusade. Being too young to fight he was left behind at the great temple on Coruscant. Initially hurt by being discarded by his Dekel, he used his time in the temple to better his own knowledge of living creatures and fauna, having inherited his people’s great love for nature. Aside from his academic pursuits he trained even more ardently on his lightsaber skills and his connection to the force so as to be ready if his master called for him to join him on the outer rim battlefields. As the war progressed and he never received the call for his presence, Tendau was offered an apprenticeship to a newly minted Jedi Knight, Garrus Atel’ya, a bothan.
Garrus was ardent in following the council’s wishes to wait on entering the war, and was key in instilling this in his pupil. Tendau took these principals to heart, giving him a great love of the Jedi way, knowledge and defense. After a few years training with Garrus, Tendau and his master were called into action during the Jedi Civil war. The men and women, who were the Republics greatest champions, were now the greatest threat it had ever faced. Through out the course of the war Tendau and his master engaged former comrades and friends in fierce combat, weathering Tendau and giving him the casual and confidant manner in which he carries himself both in and out of combat. While many friends and former friends fell around them both to their emotions and to enemies Tendau pushed on, as best they could from warzone to warzone, jungles to deserts it all seemed a blur to him. That was until near the closing volleys of the civil war, when the tandem was assigned to a boarding party at the Battle of the Star Forge. When they landed aboard one of the shattered Sith vessels attempting to keep the Republic from laying waste to the Sith’s weapon.
Upon boarding the ship with a small party of other knights and republic marines Tendau was confronted with his greatest challenge of the war. As they strode through corridors hacking and slashing, blocking and redirecting, dodging and parrying through the chaos of battle when suddenly striding towards them after impaling one of their Jedi comrades on his blood red saber, was Tendau’s former master Dekel. With a shout Garrus leaped at him with his green blade flashing out at his foe’s head. Tendau stood stock still for a moment, unable to fathom who he was being forced to do battle against. His first father figure, although he had been left behind for the war, he had loved him. An inner battle of emotions raged through him as Garrus’s and the Dekel’s sabers flicked across Tendau’s vision. Tendau finally sprung into action, gathering his concentration he began flinging shrapnel and debris from the shattered vessel against Dekel. Hitting him from all sides and causing him to stagger backwards into a blast door. Having his back against the wall, literally, the Sith lashed out with his powers blindly, while attempting to clear his blurred vision. Garrus surged forward seeing his opening and swung at the exposed side of Tendau’s former master and landed a solid blow to his chest. The Sith enraged blasted Garrus with the full extent of his sizable powers. Tendau stunned by his master’s sudden fall, when victory was so close spurred him into close combat with the wounded Sith. With a downward stroke of his own shining green blade, he bested Dekel. At seeing both of his master’s dead he bellowed with grief for the friends he had lost in the depravity of war.
Upon the conclusion of the battle it was apparent that the Jedi order was in severe trouble and the galaxy was in dire turmoil. Being an Ithorian with a strong love of life, he petitioned the council to be allowed to help in the restoration efforts of some of the shattered worlds that were left in the wake of the civil war. As his service aboard the Herdships progressed, Tendau heard rumblings of Jedi disappearing and great violence surrounding the places they had been gathering, he felt it best to leave the ships to avoid bringing undue harm to those who were healing the galaxy.
As Tendau enters the story as a bit of a wanderer with a wish to continue to heal the hurt that he feels as a Jedi he should have been able to safeguard.

**Background**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Garin Del-Fin was born into one of the most feared Mandalorian clans. The Del-Fin’s were known as one of the premier Shock Trooper clans. Always sent to where the most dangerous fighting was to take place and succeeding at what most would deem “impossible.” The reason for their surprising success was a closely guarded secret known only to the Mandalore and the other clan leaders.
Garin came of age near the end of the Mandalorian wars. Along with his best friend Jalek Bralor the two of them answered the Mandalore’s call. Having been friends since they were children it was only natural they went off together. Eventually they parted ways since both belonged to different clans.
Garin saw action almost immediately. It was then he fully realized that the reputation the clan held was one that was truly earned. For over a year he fought alongside clan mates and friends. Never did they fail to breach an enemy’s position or hold their ground when needed.
Fate had brought the two back together again in what would be one of the last battles of the war. The fighting with the Republic forces was frenzied and when it was finally over, one of the friends had fallen. Jalek was no more. Garin heard from reports that he had been consumed with the blood lust that had been known to overcome a Mandalorian when in combat.
With the war over and the Garin took it upon himself to return home with news of Jalek’s death. It was a somber meeting with his friend’s family. Despite the fact that Jalek died like a warrior should, Garin disliked being the bearer of somber news. Jalek had been like a brother and his family a close second to his own. Though Garin didn’t know it his news was a second blow to Jiles as Verna had died when Revan had bombarded Concord Dawn in an attempt to decimate the remaining Mandalorian opposition. The news of his dead son coupled with the recent death of his wife would prove to be more than the man could take.
With the war over and no Mandalore to unite them the Del-Fin clan withdrew for a bit to regroup and train those that had been taken in. Garin had missed much of that specialized training during to the war. Now without that distraction he was undergoing training again. Reshaping his direction into using the gifts that he had only begun to realize he possessed.
Five years had passed and he found himself home. Malena one of the Bralor daughters had been passing news of the family onto him on a regular basis. It also allowed the two a chance to keep up with each other. The news had been troubling in the last communiqué. Ka’ra had gone missing and Tamara their younger daughter was fast approaching her right of passage. Malena had been worried that she may not be ready for the live or die test. Wanting find out about the troubling news and having a chance to see Malena, whom he had always flirted with, Garin found himself on his way to the Bralor homestead. Upon arriving he found Jiles, a man who had been like a second father to him, drunk and a shadow of the man he once knew.
A quick and almost incoherent story was passed on to Garin. A month previous Ka’ra had stolen one of his ships. Not knowing why or what for Jiles put forth a task to Garin. Find his daughter and why she left.

**Personality**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Experienced and battle tested. Garin has lived the life of a warrior since he passed his tests. The short he spent in the war taught him much about life and death. More so than many would learn in a life time. Once his trust has been gained one can count on him for just about anything.

</details>

**Appearance**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Garin is almost never without his armor. The black, gray and red tones are colors of the Del-Fin clan, which he wears proudly and with honor. Standing at just over six feet in his armor he is not one to go unnoticed. Under the armor is a fit man with a natural tanned skin, black hair and green eyes that shine with an inner strength.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Mistress Vicious</span>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The fearsome-looking gun Elan refers to affectionately as "Mistress Vicious" was a birthday present from his father. It combines all the features of a subrepeating blaster with an ascenscion gun. Mistress Vicious has two barrels: the top one fires blaster bolts, while the lower fires the ascenscion dart. The gun also has two slots for power packs, as well as a retractable stock, allowing it to be braced before use of its autofire mode. The weapon can carry two lengths of syntherope at a time.
Switching between single fire, autofire, and ascenscion gun modes is a swift action.
Due to the gun's bulk, Elan suffers a -5 penalty on Deception checks to conceal it.

Named after Prince Xand's first pet, the Belaryot is a modified Dynamic-class freighter he purchased after selling Shanha's ship and saving money while working on the *Lookabout*. He currently flies it with the assistance of a droid copilot (IR-VN, or "Ervin") he won in a game of sabacc on Nar Shaddaa.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Elan&#39;s Bio</span>**
Male Nagai, 26
**Brief Background:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

When is a pirate not a pirate? When he's a Nightsider. Under the leadership of the cunning and ruthless Drehd Night the pirate gang known as the Nightsiders grew to be one of the most feared criminal groups operating in and around the Corellian system. For generations they have retained their stranglehold of power, prestige, and wealth, and have expanded to have influence in the underground throughout most of the known galaxy. In truth the various descendants of the Nightsiders rarely lift a finger any more, leaving the wrongdoing to the many gangs they hold dominion over. The legacy of the Nightsiders is one of wealth and prestige akin to nobility in criminal circles, and by now the descendants of the Night bloodline are for all intents royalty.
Enter Xand Night, the pirate prince.
Xand grew up with everything he could ever want, or so his parents and friends were fond of telling him. Only his private tutor, an Ithorian scholar whom had been bought from slavers expressly to educate the young prince, seemed to feel differently: "you cannot know what you want, master Xand, without experiencing new things. And how could you know if you want what you *do* have, if you've never been given the opportunity to miss it?"
Despite his position as a slave, Alau Mimwen was a good friend to Xand, perhaps recognising his ability to influence the child away from his unfortunate upbringing. He taught the boy well by not just giving answers, but inspiring his young student to find new questions.
Eventually Xand's father began to suspect the Ithorian's influence in his son's new thoughtful nature. The teacher was taken away and killed, though Xand was simply told he had quit. But Xand knew enough about the family business and had learned enough about putting two and two together from Alau to do so now. He wasn't fooled, but he wisely kept his mouth shut.
Shortly thereafter Xand found a new mentor, someone who (thankfully) his father approved of. The Togorian pirate captain Shanha (pictured) was deemed a "good" influence, and he and his crew taught Xand everything they knew. Through experience Xand began to see the attractive side of his family's line of work. He was able to put aside the memory of Alau's execution, and after some years all but forgot it.
![Togorian_small.preview.jpg](http://swagonline.net/files/images/Togorian_small.preview.jpg)
Yet all things considered he still couldn't be satisfied. He had been taught well by Shanha but he was never allowed to *do* anything. It was always "too dangerous to do this" and "let your lessers do that".
But Xand had literally learned *everything* from Shanha. He had been entrusted with the security codes of the Togorian's ship. It was an easy matter to steal it.
Later, when Shanha had grown too hoarse to shout anymore and had little choice but to calm down, he realised exactly how proud he was. True, he lost an arm for his failure and was exiled from the Nightsiders until he had tracked Xand down and brought him home, which did complicate his feelings. On balance though, he *probably* won't kill Xand next time they meet. He thinks.
Xand quickly sold the ship (unfortunately for the new owners, who were dispatched quickly when Shanha managed to track the ship down and recover it) and "went to ground", taking on the new identity Elan Aphotic. He found work for several years on the *Lookabout*, working under captain Gym Kol. He enjoyed the job and experiencing some of the wonders the galaxy had to offer, but inevitably grew tired of "honest" work and resolved to set himself up as a pirate – to get back to his family’s roots, as it were, and experience everything in thrilling first-hand.

</details>

**Past Adventures:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Elan's career as a pirate has been short but eventful. His closest call yet was when he bought stolen military supplies and discovered too late that there was a tracking device in with the goods.
![the_Officer_by_FROSTconcepts.jpg](http://th05.deviantart.net/fs49/PRE/i/2009/224/8/1/the_Officer_by_FROSTconcepts.jpg)
He jetissoned that tracker and in a fit of rebellious pique answered an incoming hail from the pursuing vessel, a *Foray*-class frigate known as the *Glorious* commanded by Eleyna Indesqu (pictured). Far from acquiescing to her orders that he not resist, Elan made light of the situation and flirted with the Republic officer.
He proved an able enough pilot to avoid destruction by the frigate's anti-starfighter armanents and take his own ship into hyperspace... although it was a very close thing.
Eleyna would love another chance to capture Elan. For his part, Elan would love another chance to let her try. Not to mention flirt with her again - her angry expression was very cute.

</details>

**Personality:** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Elan has been many things (pampered prince, eager student, callous criminal, intrepid explorer, dashing pirate...) and still plans to be many more. His personality, then, is a complex thing. He is charismatic and roguish, and often arrogant. Sometimes he seems down-to-earth, and other times he displays the hints of a superiority complex. He is usually quite callous and uncaring, but every so often displays a surprising amount of sensitivity. Not even he really knows what he’ll feel at a given time, and he’s still finding himself. Elan is at a crossroads in life, and it’s anyone’s guess where he’ll end up and what kind of sentient he’ll turn out to be.

</details>

**You Ended Up Here Because …** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Elan has most recently travelled to Nyriaan, hoping to find a way to score some of the valuable madilon ore.
At first glance Elan may seem a bad fit. But so would Han Solo, and that turned out okay for everyone involved. He will likely become involved in a case of "wrong place, wrong time" or "right place, right time" depending on how you look at it. He is not so attached to the idea of piracy that he couldn't be swept up in events and become a heroic figure (or anti-heroic, at the very least...) providing they give him the excitement and new experiences he craves.
