All OOC discussions will reside here.
As mentioned in the casting there should be no OOC comments or discussions aside from the action breakdown during combat or skill explanations.
Any comments made in the game should be placed in (( )).

If no one feels they have anything to contribute I can move things forward.

### **Tempeste** (2010-05-19 15:01:01)

I could have Kin moan about how a girls being sent on a mission but i'll refrain, don't want him to annoy everyone too much. I have nothing to add.

### **Anonymous** (2010-05-19 18:40:19)

It is getting close to 1AM, but I think I'm going to make a post tomorrow morning (which is in 5-6 hours). Though it's not super-necessary and if you wish to move things along, just do so. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Just because I skipped ahead in my post, doesn't mean you can't put in your own comments or introduce yourself to Emily.

### **Alicia** (2010-05-27 16:09:00)

Tethia asked about crew seating in the cockpit. So I don't have to repeat myself:
1 pilot
1 copilot
1 system operator/engineer
3 secure seating
The weapons are pilot (light turbolaser cannon) and copilot (point defense double laser cannons) operated.
Also Tethia, in case you didn't get my IMs. I would appreciate if you didn't make assumptions like being handed things by NPCs when it isn't declared or even mentioned the NPC is question is even in possession of such items in previous posts. If you would please edit your post to follow what's happening that would be appreciate. Don't worry Ka'ra won't forget about your saber, she's still disarmed herself.
This is a good reminder for everyone to make sure to pay attention to what's going on.

### **Alicia** (2010-05-31 09:41:29)

Going to wait for Jason and Temp to catch up before moving on.

### **Tempeste** (2010-05-31 12:36:08)

My computer is out of action at the moment so please don't wait on my account. Kin will probably just sleep for the journey.

### **Alicia** (2010-05-31 20:51:28)

I edited my post. It had been written up at work and was actually rewritten after my iPad had deleted my original when I had switched browser windows.

I´ll be gone for a few days, and I won´t have the ability to post until late Sunday. If you feel the need to do so, you can roleplay Yuri, though otherwise you can just have him hang around quietly.

Thanks for letting me know. I've started working on a PM reply for your post. Safe travels!

### **Tempeste** (2010-06-03 15:24:18)

Okay Computer is working again (Mostly because I've replaced 80% of it) so I will get a post up soon, probably tomorrow.

### **Alicia** (2010-06-04 13:29:54)

Now that I was finally able to get the forum dice mod to work, I'd like to put it to use.
To roll you use the bbcode

```
[dice][/dice]
```

You will notice if you go back in to edit your post that it will appear as:

```
[dice]0[/dice]
```

This prevents you from cheating and re-rolling. Only a moderator can make the roll "removable".
Also, at this time you can't include your modifier in the roll so you will still have to OOC in the modifier after the roll to look like the following
(( Search your feelings, UTF +10 ))

***5*** <- [5] 1d20

Using the dice is optional, if you would still prefer me to roll for you. Using this will at least let you go back into your post and include a Force Point.

### **Alicia** (2010-06-05 17:21:05)

Wanted to get some feedback on the system I'm planning on using for the favors before I "officially" post in in the Rules and Regulations section. I changed my mind concerning the one use deal. Read on to see what I decided on.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Favors</span>
Purchasing your favor at the beginning provided you with an ally as per the rules in Scum and Villiany (p75) with some modifications.
They provide their assistance free of charge, as long as the heroes maintain good relations.
All purchased allies start with an attitude of friendly. Friendly allies will happily offer advice, information, or-when asked- assistance, as long as no substantial risk or cost is involved.
Allies with a helpful attitude is quick to contact the hero when opportunities arise (even if the helpful ally stands to gain little); furthermore, they will accept significant (but not foolhardy) risks and costs to assist the hero.
If an ally has an attitude lower than friendly toward the hero, they will be less likely to assist the hero in his endeavors.
A hero can attempt to improve his ally's attitude with him by reciprocating favors or by any other creative means.
**Assistance**
A hero can gain assistance from their ally at no additional cost provided it is within the ally's means. The ally can also provide money (as a loan) or equipment. In either case the ally can offer a total of (CL x 1,000) credits in either cash, commodities or equipment. The items can be from any availablity but are subject to whether the ally would have access to the items. For example, a Jedi Historian may have a collection of lightsaber cyrstals or even holocrons but wouldn't have access to an assortment of illegal blaster rifles. To gain equipment and commodities, the hero must have the money to front the cost of the item. For example, the CL 3 arms dealer has access to a Micro Grenade Launcher which costs 2,500 credits. The hero must be able to pay the cost of the weapon (2,500 credits) and, if applicable, the licence.
When a hero gains assistance from their ally, they will make a Persuasion check making a "change attitude" check to insure their relations with their ally. The ally's attitude after the check will determine the ally's willingness to assist the hero in the future.
**Leveling an ally**
As a hero grows and develops, so may your ally. An ally may never be more than two CLs above the hero. Through your adventures you can send money to your ally which would also allow them to develop in their areas of expertise. By supporting them monetarily you can maintain your good relations and increase their own usefulness.
**Level**| **Cost (credits per level)**
1-5 | 1,500
6-10 | 2,000
11-15 | 3,000
15-20 | 5,000

### **Alicia** (2010-06-05 22:22:00)

OKAY! Apparently people are confused about the layout of the shuttle... It's split up into three sections: cargo bay <!-- s=> -->![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!-- s=> --> Living area <!-- s=> -->![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!-- s=> --> cockpit. There is a hatch which separates the cargo bay from the living area and then the living area from the cockpit. Think of a modern day submarine. Everything is separate.
Unless you were in the same room or actively listening in through the bulkheads would you be able to overhear someone talking normally from another section.
Hope this clears things up.

Been rather slammed at work due to a festival. I'll be attempting to put up a post Saturday evening, Sunday evening (EST) at the latest. If you wanted to put in your two cents or haven't yet, this would be the time before things are moved forward again.

Been very busy with a party for people on the street today and I'll be busy tomorrow too, so if you don't want to wait until Monday for a post, then Fiolla'll be quiet for this post, so that you can move on.

### **Sketchpad** (2010-07-03 19:32:25)

Quick Q ... as far as the Nagai are concerned, they aren't all that known in this era, correct? Is it possible that Drem may have some knowledge of them? Just looking in context to a future post ...

---

### **Anazider** (2010-07-04 11:59:52)

As I understand it, any Nagai found in the galaxy prior to their introduction during the New Republic era are either explorer's/refugees of the Tof War, or advanced scouts for the invasion. The former (refugees) is more prominent earlier in the Galaxy's history, with the advanced scout bit becoming more prevalent the closer you get to their eventual evasion.
So... Not sure how much that answer's your question, or if you can extrapolate what you want from there.

### **Alicia** (2010-07-06 19:01:35)

### **Alicia** (2010-07-08 08:15:24)

Gah! Seriously people.. How many times did Sajin and Lanius have to say that the distraction Lanius and Ka'ra were going to set off was a power generator overload.... And you wonder WHY the station may want to evacuate?
Example 1: <!-- l -->[viewtopic.php?p=50820#p50820](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=50820#p50820 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=50820#p50820")<!-- l -->

Edit - Sorry that came out rather harsh. I woke up and found myself rather annoyed when I read the latest posts. The cause and effect of the distraction have been known for a while now. What seriously went through my mind was: Does anyone actually read the posts? Is it a hard stretch for me to think that your characters can put two and two together and realize that if an evacuation may be in progress that the distraction may have been put into play?

---

### **Sketchpad** (2010-07-08 12:53:18)

Answer me this? Would you stand around while a heavily armed person who apparently has lied to you talks with someone who keeps indicating things aren't going to plan? Very suspicious if you ask me... I know I would get the hell out of dodge.
Yes talking is a free action, meaning in combat it won't take up an action. I do have the right however if you go on a monologue to say that was your action. Course I find that to be common sense.

That would be true if you had some kind of code to get in. Since one wasn't shared with you, you are effectively locked out.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-02 14:23:09)

Alicia, I´m not sure how you want to handle my using Cloak. The book says I have to make a new check each round I maintain it, but for as long as I can, I´d like to keep taking 10 to keep it up without problems.
I suppose the simplest thing would be you telling me when I need to make a new check, or even make the check yourself.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-08-08 12:48:25)

As we start getting into more combat scenarios I would like to mention that I do expect all of you to make the necessary edits to your sheets after the results of each round are declared.
This includes whenever you spend a FP or DP, which should be edited out upon declaring their use.
When you take CT damage, just make a note next to your HP that you are "-step CT". I don't expect you to go through and make the necessary adjustments to Skills and Defenses due to the condition. Please remember that your Damage Threshold (DT) is also affected by CT.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-09 19:24:58)

### **Alicia** (2010-09-14 12:54:36)

Fantastic job everyone!
Please take a moment to level your characters to level 4. If you have HP damage, add in your HP increase into your current total, ie 34/50 HP, you gain 10 HP with your new level, 44/60 is your new total.
Don't forget to include any non core abilities into your explanation block with book and page number.

### **Alicia** (2010-09-26 11:26:52)

Made a slight addendum to the Rule Changes. I somehow missed there was already a Soldier talent called Armor Mastery so I have changed the name for the combined AD and IAD to *Armored Defense Mastery*.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-11-01 10:21:06)

I did some slight editing to the first post of Ch. 2.
Here's the paragraph changed
> The *Titan&#39;s Valiant* resumes it&#39;s original mission mandated by the Republic to patrol their quadrant of the Outer Rim, a mission you learn about easily should you decide to ask. It would also be learned Captain Prius hasn&#39;t revealed the truth about the earlier operation to recover the Force Harvester providing only an adequate cover story meant to allay any suspicions from the rest of the crew.

I have created a dice roller template for anyone who wishes to use it. It's located in the post models drop down.
For a description on how to use it see the [Feature thread](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=24538 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=24538")
Here's an example of what's on the template:
**Skill** +mod

***5*** <- [5] 1d20

**Attack** weapon +mod (special notes)

***14*** <- [14] 1d20

***damage*** +mod

***5*** <- [3, 2] 2d8

You can take 20 since you are trained and not in any rush, it will take longer, however, than normal. Did you still wish to take 20?
BTW, have you been including the ship's INT in your checks? Since the computer is friendly you get that bonus as well.

You may spend the destiny points when you wish. Just include that spenditure in your post.
Also since it would have been impossible to make that attack roll with a FP you may keep it.

The only attack is Taniths attempt to lock the fighter in a tractor beam. The fighter is otherwise moving to withdraw.
If you want to attack you have a good chance of hitting with a FP.

### **Alicia** (2011-01-05 10:51:11)

Let's get back in the game people!
@Magic: Aiming is two consecutive swift actions in the same round. Aiming bonus will not apply to your attack if made in the next round. Also, splash (and other area attacks) is only in character scale, not vehicle.

---

### **Magical2099** (2011-01-06 00:58:24)

i know about the splash, its more flavor than any odd hope that it comes apart so violently that it takes the other with it *crosses fingers*
as for the aiming i was reading the rule on page 20 of SotG, which must conflict the RaW of core, my mistake, just ignore the aim. only purpose for it was to lock on in case i missed anyway. change it to move, attack, swift to start recharge, just one turn instead of two. ill edit it asap (probably tomorrow night)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-01-10 14:09:30)

---

### **Alicia** (2011-01-10 14:27:06)

I updated the post.
If Magic doesn't post today, I will be going ahead and making a roll in an attempt to negate the roll. If the attack is negated then my post will be changed.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-07 16:50:03)

I have to say I am a bit confused by some peoples actions here. We´ve been explicitly told that we can´t make any more Mechanics checks for this Skill Challenge, and yet two people are using Aid Another on a third one who they apparently also expects will use Mechanics. Are you setting up for some non-Challenge related Mechanics check that seems important, or did you miss the line that said we can´t make more Mechanics checks? Or is there a third possible answer that I am unaware of?
Just curious to see if I missed something.

I hope your weekend was pleasant! Things have been busy around here for me and I apologize for my lack of a post the last couple of days.. I just got home a little bit ago from being out with my mom all day and having class. I doubt I'll be getting a post up till Thurs, but really there's little input you need from me at the moment as it seems this is a perfect opportunity to RP and full Elan in on the details or as much as you'd like to tell him.
If there isn't anything up by Thurs I will definitely be pushing things forward.

hey, you folks wanna try the analysis bit of Gather Info? seems like a good place for it since we're gonna be split up canvassing the city. I'll edit in a page number once i find it.

I'll most likely be posting after work.
As of right now is this how you all are splitting up?
Tanith and Elan - check out rumors/current events around cantinas and space port.
Tendau, Yuri, and Drem - get a look at the Republic agents' domiciles
Garin - see if he can sell his services to Czerka

### **jwol** (2011-04-18 23:14:52)

Sorry for the delay. I tried to leave the posts open for your own individual contributions, use what information you want. Particularly the trio scouting out the apartments. I wasn't sure how long you were going to observe so just provided you with all the information you need.
Please notice I changed the title for chapter 2. I decided to split this mission into two chapters so we don't have a huge thread, but the split won't be for a while yet.

### **Alicia** (2011-04-20 16:54:34)

As a clarification for those at the apartment building. The emergency stairwell is inside, think a basic concrete emergency stairwell you may see at a hotel. There's no windows to see out of inside it nor are there many windows in the main hallway of the floor. There is not one near the apartment in question.
DA you may edit your post relating to the apartment. I will have a post with the results of your checks to your other inquiries shortly.

Drem does not go with Tendau and Yuri to the apartment, instead goes back the ship to start on repairs. (Magic, please deduct 500 credits for the needed parts.)

### **Magical2099** (2011-04-22 00:09:52)

It looks okay to me, but I think you need to take another look at the map provided. There is no way you can reach the door in a single Move action.

Jwol and DA, for future reference:
If you are intentionally jumping down from a height you would use Jump/Athletics skill. To use Acrobatics to reduce falling damage you need to be trained and it's normally usefull if you aren't make a conscious choice to fall (or escape from a falling object).
Besides if you're using surge you're more likely to pass a conscious jump/fall check then with acrobatics.
You only needed one check for the fall so I will be ignoring your acrobatics checks,

OK, I assumed that they were cumulative. You know, like first moving to jump down with your feet first, flexing knees on impact to reduce damage (ie using Athletics), and then letting the momentum of your body falling to turn yourself into a roll (ie using Acrobatics). I know that´s how I´d resolve a high fall in real life.

Sorry Alicia, but our idea was somewhat different than just making a complaint so this may require an edit and a bit of roleplaying rather than a summary.
Elan's plan is to threaten the navigator with exposure of his cowardly reaction in order to get him to provide a ship's manifest with data on the two missing agents. We wanted to go directly to him and hold the threat of the complaint over him, see if he'd crack and give us what we want in order to prevent us from pursuing the matter. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Suppose I should have mentioned the navigator Tevlun has already taken a ship up to the orbiting station. Kind of hard to threaten him if he isn't even on the planet. What's your next course and I'll make an edit.

### **Magical2099** (2011-05-13 17:30:27)

the one Yuri is taking to Drem. I think me and Elan are the only ones with use comp.
it would be more like "hey, guys, we got nothing" "dude that sucks, we got blown up and found a datapad" "really?" "yeah" "want me to hack it for ya?" "sure"

---

### **simplyscribed** (2011-05-14 08:43:43)

With nothing better to do, and with his companions unwilling to furnish him with enough detail that he can reasonably expect to do more to help, Elan determines to take a stroll around Locus. He keeps to well-frequented areas in case of another attack, and keeps his comm line open in case he is required. Before parting ways with Tanith he makes sure he's seen the holos of the two individuals they're looking for, on the off-chance he spots them in his wanderings.
Being easily distracted by good times when he has no urgent business to attend to, he will no doubt be drawn to any locations, events, or people he spots during his walk who offer excitement and/or fun.

Well for my part Elan is really just killing time until something interesting happens that involves some roleplaying, or failing that I'm content to just wait until the IC moment the group summon him back, or I see something interesting happening in the story at a location he could feasibly end up at and Elan conveniently decides to wander there at just the right time... <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

### **Alicia** (2011-06-29 19:51:54)

DA,~~only one FP may be spent in one round. Since you don't need the first one. I'll ignore it.~~
Bah, Got my train of thought mixed up...
In a surprise round you can only take one action (unless you have the appropriate ability). You will have to choose between attacking and maintaining your cloak. You can still burn the FP (which had rolled a 1) for that Suprise round, though it wasn't needed for the attack roll you had it designated for.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-06-30 06:28:12)

I'd suggest between us we at least take:
1 of the entrenching tools
1 fusion lanterns
Both plastents
1 power generator
1 water extractor
And as much food and water as we can carry
Elan will help carry this stuff. He doesn't need any of the weapons and such, he'll be content to take his own.

You'll probably want to take all the lamps and glowrods you have available to you. This world is rather dark.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-10-27 12:54:47)

I could second that list, but I´m not sure what we need the power generator for. I´d rather take the food processor, to make sure we have a reliable supply of food and water. I´m also not crazy about taking a lot of lamps with us. I think most of us have glow rods in our utility belts, and we have a few people who can see quite well in the dark with only that as illumination. Putting up a lot of lights could just be an invitation for predators.

Ok I'm fully back to watching / posting, have one up soon 8)

---

### **simplyscribed** (2011-10-27 18:27:52)

Because we need something to plug the hairdryer into?

---

### **jwol** (2011-10-27 19:20:44)

I know Tendau rolls with a good amount of survival gear, if we say have him grab a lamp and the generator, and then focus on the rest being divided up between the rest of the crew maybe that would help? That way we could carry a good amount of the stuff....also maybe look into renting a speeder that could carry the stuff for us?

---

### **jwol** (2011-10-27 19:24:39)

Also we probably want the antidote synthesizer, never know what we may run into.

---

### **Alicia** (2011-10-27 21:57:34)

I haven't forgotten, and yes I will have a post up soon. My brother came over and completely side tracked me.
There will be a post up tomorrow night come hell or high water.
Take this as an opportunity to hammer out any details on your end.

Ah, then Yuri won´t be carrying it at least, as he wouldn´t really use that...

---

### **Magical2099** (2011-10-29 16:54:52)

Alicia, I know my swoop can carry only so much in storage, but can we arrange to strap stuff on it some how? Also, the crew should rent/steal/finagle a speeder. Then the gear won't matter except on a case by case basis.

---

### **Alicia** (2011-10-29 17:10:41)

Renting a speeder is an option.
It doesn't look like I'll be getting a post up today either. Things just keep getting thrown at me when I sit down to write the post. GAH! *ducks an incoming projectile*

Elan would have absolutely no issues doing that whatsoever. :P

### **Alicia** (2011-10-31 12:02:13)

BTW, post is written, just waiting on your decision now.

### **jwol** (2011-10-31 13:35:03)

I say Tendau is of the opinion we ***RENT*** it haha. Stealing isn't really the jedi way unless its life or death.

---

### **Magical2099** (2011-10-31 14:37:46)

yeah, stealing that lumbering beast is a no go. we can rent it.

The speeder will be 400cr deposit and 50cr/day to rent. I'll be putting the post up shortly.

Intro post has been updated with the map. You may start outside or inside of the vehicle. Be aware it's a move action to get in/out of it. Let me know if you have questions.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-11-01 13:29:53)

Two questions:
I remembered Yuri was hurt during the last chapter, has he healed anything?
Can I use Sense Surroundings against Total Concealment? The rulebook only say Total Cover, which frankly makes no sense to me, though nothing was said about it in the errata.

---

### **Alicia** (2011-11-01 19:33:07)

jwol, please include a perception roll.
Also igniting your lightsaber is part of the move action to draw it. Thankfully for you that's the case otherwise you took too many actions <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Just some normal OT that has to be done during off-hours. Great OT just sucks that I'm beat. By the time the kids are in bed around 8:30pm I'm just about falling asleep on the couch. So I fall asleep on the couch. Wake up around 11-12. Go to bed. Get up at 3am and go to work. Wash and repeat. And I started my on-call rotation week on Tuesday so even more opportunity to get called in.

Please consider Elan's course of action to be the same as already described until circumstances change - cautiously sneaking round until he can see the first assailant (or anyone else), or until he himself is spotted, or until a peaceful resolution is reached. If I need to continue making more Stealth checks, let me know.

Not unless you don't mind me making them. I don't have the book but I'm fairly sure you have to make a check each round you move.

### **simplyscribed** (2011-11-08 11:39:40)

I suspect you may be right, although arbitrarily saying you have a chance of suddenly drastically changing your results every 6 seconds into a single effort seems a bit daft to me. It would make more sense to just stick with the one result until the activity is reset by some interruption or change of circumstances.

Technically if you think about it, movement has the habit of drawing the eye and there are conditions around you say moving a branch the wrong way or stepping on a twig which might call attention to yourself. Your Stealth check as an indicator of how well you move through such conditions.

---

### **jwol** (2011-11-09 10:10:11)

I edited my post to include my perception check for trying to locate the attackers, I dont know if the swift to negate cover and then to locate them allows me to be able to fight defensively as well in the same round? Becasue if so Tendau wants to take a defensive posture while standing tall haha.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-11-09 10:19:22)

Both the Perception check and Fighting Defensively are Standard actions, so you can´t use them both at once.

Sadly it seems I've lost all of you... I really wish things had gone better, and can't help but wonder if there was anything else I could have done. We had a nice run (nearly over a year) and I'm sad things stalled as they did.
I'll be working on moving everything to the archive in the next week or two. If there's anything you want to keep, or had a change of heart in wanting to continue, you have till April 2 to get things in order. I will of course be PMing out character sheets for you to keep.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-21 18:54:46)

Well, I´d just like to say I enjoyed the game, but yeah, things got a bit stalled at the end.
We did just get some new players after all, so if you still want to go on, you could try to recruit some more. Or perhaps re-launch the game from some other point in the plotline. I´d definitely be in, as I love Old Republic games, especially the kind that might one day allow me to get into some epic lightsaber battles against dark Jedi and Sith.

---

### **Alicia** (2012-03-21 19:23:27)

I've thought about doing that. I might just but we'll see. Maybe see what sort of interest there is before making a final decision.

If I did a restart of sorts, it would be with new characters. I would essentially be bringing in a new team to deal with other issues going on in the background of the current plot line.

You mean I have to go back and read? What kind of racket *is* this?! Lol! I thought as much. I didn't realize I was on the lower deck of the ship but now that you mention Nar Shadaa I remember that. I'm in my pj's and I just woke up and my children are having school about six feet from me while listening to the Nutcracker. I couldn't quite find the motivation to go back and read when the smileys on the right were very clearly distracting them from reading about Russ and Kim racing a van. Have a good weekend all!

For the benefit of not encouraging disinformation...
Acheron Base was a R&D station located in an asteroid field several hours away from Telia IV, it's not in orbit and likely not even in the same system. Lanius is pretty much THE administrator for the base on Telia which is why it's been used along with the *Titan's Valiant* as a sort of base of operations.
I think there was something else, but a lot has been going through my mind and I'm missing it.

I fixed the Davian reference, but he's hoping Jut-Hakk will see reason, not Tonin. Unless I've missed a great deal somehow, I neither knew we had the FH or that Tonin was a bad guy...? Apologies if I have.

Since we have effectively lost BW, would you like me to attempt to find a third person or even two, or would you like to continue on with just you two for the time being?

### **Alicia** (2013-03-06 22:54:55)

The following addendum has been made to my House Rules;
**Destiny Unleashed** Destiny Points may be spent as normal, but they may also be used to attempt things that the character would otherwise be incapable of or that might not be permissible within the constraints of the rules.
The player states their proposed action, then declares a number of Destiny Points they are willing to stake to make the action happen. They may also suggest one or more serious consequences that the action will have on the character in an attempt to reduce the amount of Destiny Points required.
The GM then either accepts the offer or makes a counter offer which the player can in turn accept or refuse.
If negotiation is successful the action occurs, the agreed amount of Destiny Points are spent, and any consequences agreed on are suffered by the character.
*Example uses of Destiny:*

Natural 20, or negate a critical hit: 1 Destiny Point
Use an Unleashed ability (FU p35 & 37): 1 Destiny Point, and move 1 persistent step down the Condition Track (this consequence is not suffered by anyone who possesses the Unleashed Feat)
Unique effects: 1 or more Destiny Points, variable consequences.

A roll like that is *never* for nothing, my short drunken companion. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: --> I talked briefly with Alicia about rejoining with Ooru if only to let him fade away nicely via a stray blaster bolt or something.
