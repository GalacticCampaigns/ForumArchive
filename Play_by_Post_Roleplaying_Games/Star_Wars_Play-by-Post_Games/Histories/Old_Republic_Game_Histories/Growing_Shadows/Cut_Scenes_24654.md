## Chapter One: Introduction - Ka'ra and Fiolla

### **Alicia** (2010-05-18 18:45:10)

After the long trip on the transport, Ka'ra has yet to indicate what was going on, what the mission might be. Keeping your mouth shut, you are suprised when the Herald-class shuttle drops out of hyperspace to be greeted by a Republic Hammerhead cruiser. The crew of the shuttle, obviously having thought this was a standard cargo with a passenger drop off, is startled and alarmed. Scattering to their stations in an attempt to avoid the obvious danger the ship posses to them. Ka'ra looks over pointedly, reminding you to keep your cool and your mouth shut.
The Hammerhead brings the shuttle aboard, the crew, Ka'ra and you are arrested, and escorted off relieved of your weapons. Odd though, the crew was led off in a different direction than you and Ka'ra are being taken. The escorts lead you through the halls of the cruiser till you're stopped outside of a door,which promptly opens at a guards command. Ka'ra doesn't wait to be nudged through, and steps into the room.
Waiting inside is a woman in her late 30s. Her brown hair pulled up in a no nonsense way and dressed in the Republic Navy's uniform of an officer. Her back is to the door as she looks out the view port to the stars beyond. With the hiss of the opening door she turns her head slightly.
"Thank you, Majors. You can wait outside." The two escorts exchange a meaningful look, but turn to leave the room.
Looking around you see the long, oval conference table betraying this room is one of the ships conference rooms. The officer doesn't turn around again as Ka'ra steps forward toward her. "Su cuy'gar. Nice show, Captain. Almost believed it myself. I doubt though you'll get much information from them. Not that they know much."
"You never know Ka'ra." Finally the captain turns to face you. Her gaze coming to rest on you as she looks the two of you over. "You must be Fiolla. Lanius said he believed you ready. I hope he is right."
Before you can respond, Ka'ra speaks up. "Niandra, all pleasantries aside, would you get these haar'chak cuffs off."
With a laugh the captain steps forward and releases the cuffs on both of you, an audible click as the latch disengages.
"Have the other's arrived yet?" Ka'ra asks as she reaches up to remove the helmet from her head, her piercing blue eyes meeting yours before resting on the Captain.
"Not yet, we'll be jumping to hyperspace to be making the first rendezvous shortly. It won't be long now." Ka'ra nods at this, setting her helmet on the table. "I'll have Tentia and the child sent up here." With a look over at you she adds, "As well as some refreshments."
Ka'ra nods again as she plops down into a chair. The Captain gives you a small smile as she leaves the room with the two escorts standing just outside as guards.
Throughout the trip through hyperspace, Fiolla has been rather quiet, alternativing her time between speaking to nearby crewmembers, Ka'ra and lastly of course meditating in an attempt to get a greater understanding of the force, though mostly the meditations are to comfort her nerves, feeling just slightly unsettled by the little information she has received. It's not helped by the fact that this is more important than her training sessions with Lanius.
The unsettling grows when the young woman lays her eyes on the Republic cruiser, though her training and Ka'ra's look keeps her from going into panic. This beginning panic grows in strength, until it is actual fear, after she is disarmed. Though she refuses to let any soldiers get an idea that she's afraid of this place, so she grit her teeth into a frown instead.
The trip to the view lounge passes by with Fiolla keeping up that frown and when she first sees the captain, the frown deepens even more, as the fear within her grows stronger. So when the majors leave and the Captain speaks to Ka'ra, Fiolla is utterly surprised, even visibly, for just a few seconds, before her mask is back in place. She gives the Captain a nod, listening to her and Ka'ra's conversation, while her mind is filled with all sorts of questions to which she holds no answer.
She is broken out of her thoughts when she realizes that someone is speaking in her direction. A second later the young girl has gathered her thoughts enough to be able to reply. As she does this she keeps her face as unemotional as possible, while giving a slight nod to acknowledge the existence of the Captain, but not deep enough to show herself submissive.
"You are well informed, Captain. I am Fiolla and if Master Lanius believes me ready, neither you or I have any reason to doubt his judgement."
After this statement, she resumes listening to the conversation between the Republic Captain and the young Mandalorian with curiosity, wondering about the identities of those mentioned and who these 'others' are that was mentioned in the conversation. She quickly gives a short reply when refreshments are mentioned.
"There is no reason to find refreshments just for me, Captain, I am fine," Fiolla says to the Captain, then casts another glance over at Ka'ra, hoping that the Force will soon provide her with some answers.
Captain Prius nods in affirmation of Fiolla's statement. "Indeed, Lanius seems to believe he knows what he's doing." She opens the door into the hallway, the stench of the Strill wafting in before it makes is own appearance. "Looks like it left your charge, Ka'ra."
Ka'ra replies with a shrug as she watches it come in, "Tentia does as it wills." The statement is emphasised by it first nudging Ka'ra's legs and then jumping easily into her lap. It's six legs hanging or folding oddly underneath it.
Prius shakes her head she she turns once more and departs.
Ka'ra doesn't look up as she scratches the strange creature under its chin. "I know you have questions, Fiolla. Most of them will have to wait, but I can answer what I can."
As the Strill enters the room, Fiolla, who had been standing near Ka'ra before, takes a short step away from her, or rather, away from the stench. She takes a deep breath and then focuses the force through her body, allowing her to get the most out of the air. After a few seconds and after hearing Ka'ra's question, Fiolla gives a small nod, staring down at the horribly smelly creature at the same time.
"Questions? I do have a few, that's true. Can you tell me more about this? What is with this ship, with the Republic's involvement?"
Ka'ra frowns deeply, "Lanius would have to tell you that. I'm sorry but I swore to him I wouldn't say more than what's required." She looks troubled that she can't share the answeres. "I can tell you the consequences for failing could effect the entire galaxy."
Fiolla gives Ka'ra another nod, this time focusing her gaze on the helmet that covers Ka'ra's face. "There will be no failure. Master Lanius would have joined us himself if he felt it was truly necessary."
"He has a part to play himself. We'll be meeting up with him again soon."
The young Jedi takes just another big breath, then keeps it in once again, at least until she has become used to the stench or it has become more telerable. "My master believes in me. We shall not fail in this, of that I am certain. Can you tell more about what is planned now? And what exactly is... that?" The last is said with Fiolla making a quick point at the smelly creature.
Ka'ra grins as Fiolla points to the creature. "Yes, I forgot you've never meet Tentia. It's a strill." Tickling under the strills chin its mouth lulls open in pleasure. "As for what's planned.. I'll tell that once we have the rest of the team gathered."
Fiolla glances down at Tentia. "A Strill? Have you thought of giving it a shower of some sort? You might not feel it behind that helmet, but it does have a certain... stench about it." As for the question answered, Fiolla gives another nod. "Can you tell me more about the team, then?"
"I've been around it since I was a baby so I'm used to the smell... And you try getting Tentia into a bath, not a very dry experience."
Fiolla shakes her head and then lets out a sigh. "There must be some other way of neutralizing the smell. It is almost burning my eyes." Well, almost and almost, exaggeration makes things more obvious.
Ka'ra lets out a short laugh. "You'll get used to it." During the discussion about it, one of Tentia's eyes remained open, watching Fiolla carefully. Through the viewport you can see the cruiser had at some point made a smooth transition into hyperspace. The trip isn't long for as soon as one would look back the stars start to return to normal once more.
"By the Force, I hope not." Fiolla exclaims, without thinking about it. "I mean, I hope I'm not around long enough to get used to it. I'm not pleased about such strong scents. No offense meant you of course." She looks over Tentia, wondering if it is intelligent in some way.
At the outburst Tentia opens its mouth to show its double layered mouth of sharp teeth. "You better appologize. It's rather sensitive and you don't want to be on its bad side."
Fiolla stares at Tentia's sharp teeth, not thinking about it, as she takes yet another step away, before she gets the Strill trying to bite off her face. After hearing Ka'ra's words, she quickly adds. "And no offense to Tentia of course, the smell is just making me ill."
Tentia closes its mouth and seems to consider Fiolla again before its eyes close and Ka'ra begins petting it once more. "The others should be arriving soon. I would make yourself comfortable." With one hand stroking the strill, her other hand finds her helmet and she puts it back on with a soft hiss.
With that comment Fiolla nods and gets closer to Ka'ra. She folds her hands in front of her, simply waiting, while spending her time meditating on the force and its mysteries.

## Captain Prius's office - Pre-Mission Chapter One

### **Alicia** (2010-05-23 20:50:50)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Captain Prius&#39;s office - Pre-Mission</span>
"**Sounds like he's going to cause trouble.**" Prius says from her position from behind her desk. Leaning back she takes in the young woman who is staring out a nearby view port. Her helmet rests where she placed it, at the edge of the captain's desk. Beside it rests the weapons the guards had taken off of her and Fiolla.
"**I've dealt with worse,**" Ka'ra says flatly. Looking back at the older woman she gives her a mischievous smile. "A**t least he hasn't pulled a weapon on me… yet.**"
"**He didn't come armed to a briefing or he may have.**"
Turning back to the view port she watches the stars pass by. "**I'm sure now that's over the initial shock of my presence we'll be able to work something out. He thinks I mean to kill everyone.**" With a shake of her head, Ka'ra indicates her annoyance and disgust on the matter. After a long pause she turns to look at Prius fully."**Niandra, I doubt you had me come here to talk about one my misguided team mates.**"
"**No, Ka'ra I didn't.**" Prius taps her fingers on her desk, thinking. "**What Lanius and you are doing is dangerous, are you sure this is the only way?**"
"**You don't know how many times we went over the plan… We can't do it alone. It will be hard enough for the two of us to hold off Jut-hakk should we get caught. The others will be neded to get the weapon out of his reach while we provide the distraction.**"
"**Neither of you have told me what it is exactly.**"
With a shrug, Ka'ra replies, "**I barely understand how it works. Best you wait for Lanius to explain it to you. I only know that if Jut-hakk follows through, there'll be nothing left alive at the end of the year.**"

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Telia V </span>- Two weeks before arriving on the *Titan's Valiant*
During your stay on Telia, Tanith begins to scout and see what sort of exploiting he can do of the planet's resources Lanius mentioned.
Taking to the caverns where records of a rich vein of gemstones can be found he's able to mine 14g of varying quality of gemstones and even some crystals.
Tanith would show Tendau his loot, and Tendau would discover that at least three of the crystals are of good quality and possess the capability to be used in lightsabers.
While Tendau can't distinguish what exactly those properties would be, the amber, red and white colored crystals could probably catch a fair price should Tanith wish to sell them.
"What does that mean Tendau? That they could be used in lightsaber construction? What is such worth? What do they do?" Tanith asks, eying the crystals in his hand as they are poisonous.
"Well, I can't tell you exactly what these would do, but I can feel the force coursing through them, and that is a tell tale sign these could be used as either focus crystals or even augmented power crystals, to add to the efficiency of the lightsabers." Closing his eyes and reaching out with the force towards each crystal individually Tendau attempts to see if he can distinguish which crystals are power crystals, and which are focus crystals, as well as what their properties are. "If you were to give me some time with them I may be able to distinguish which they are, and what they are worth, and I most definitely would be interested in purchasing at least one if you would allow it."
"Focus... augmenting... more efficient? Aye..." he responds, lost deep in thought staring out into nothing. "Aye, hold them till we leave this place then. I'll get them back when next we leave this abominably dry planet, eh?"
"Thank you my friend, I will consult the library Lanius has collect as well as the force to see what I can gather of these crystals."
After that, Tendau retreats back to the library with the 3 crystals.
After his eyes pop open and the jedi comes out of the trance. Racking his brain for the knowledge the force may have given him, if not he will start to go over the libraries extensive volumes for better knowledge of the crystals contained with in.
After long hours of meditation and research, the ithorian seeks Tanith out and relays his findings. "Good news my friend, the force has smiled upon us. After long hours of study and probing the crystals with the force I have been able to identify properties of two of the three crystals. The red crystal can add devasting injuries to an opponent harmed by the lightsBer that contains it, although I sense something unsavory about it, a dark path it may lend to. As for the white crystal, it lends itself to a calming aura, most likely related to healing and tranquility. As for the amber I unfortunately could not identify it. I would ask Master Lanius if he may know about or know someone who may be able to identify it." Taking a deep breath after relaying his mouthful of information the Jedi continues towards his request. "I know you were looking for resources to sell my friend, and I know these crystals can catch a fair price each, but I would like to request the white crystal. You knowing my background, I feel it could treaty augment my abilities, especially in the healing aspects. If it makes a differnxe Tanith I can pay you all I have left of the credits left to me by the temple, although I had hoped to keep them in case of emergency. What say you friend?"
"I know a little of you Tendau. Traveling together some weeks doesn't mean we are bosom buddies, eh? If it helps, you are the only Jedi here I trust at all. I think anything that makes Jedi stronger should be done away with, personally. And I think you're a bit to good hearted for me to hold you to your word for an unnamed favor at a later date. As for credits, I've seen dozens of Jedi sway millions of credits with a word, but I've never seen one carry many heh! Tell you what, friend Tendau, if I can't find a good use for it, or a large sum of credits, its yours, eh?"
to be continued...
