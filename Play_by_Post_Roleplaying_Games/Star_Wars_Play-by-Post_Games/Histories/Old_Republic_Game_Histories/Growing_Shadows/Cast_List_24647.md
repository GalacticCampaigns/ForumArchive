<details><summary>Background</summary>

Pretty much born into the Jedi Order, Yuri has few memories from outside the Temple, and his time spent there has formed him into a person colored a lot by the principles of the Order and its Code. As his training progressed, he proved to be gifted in the art of lightsber combat, and gifted with an ability to catch fleeting insights into the imminent future through the Force, something which most likely aided him in his skill with the blade. Still, he always suspected that there was more to being a Jedi than just those skills, and he would often spend time in various locations of the Temple, meditating for himself and seeking some deeper insight. Eventually he would be approached by a man known for being a deep philosopher and thinker himself, the revered Jedi Watchman and council member Zez-Kai Ell, who would express interest in his abilities, and would take him as his padawan.
Now apprenticed to a master, Yuri discovered another aspect of the Jedis life, the part where he travelled the Galaxy to provide assistance and council where needed. This he enjoyed very much, and he found that even though he had been born into the life, his place in the Galaxy was as a Jedi, serving the people of the Republic. His time with master Ell was most rewarding in his experience, as the wise Jedi would teach him never to rely only on his lightsaber or the Force to resolve a situation, and told him a Jedi resorted to those means only as a last resort. These years were probably the best of his life, as he felt himself doing what he was supposed to do, and doing it well. That would all change, however, when the warlord known as Mandalore the Ultimate made his move into the Galaxy.
The war changed everything, and when the call came from Revan to rally the Order to meet the threat, Yuri was torn. He heard the wisdom of the call, and in his opinion this was his duty as a Jedi, to stand as a shield of the innocent and repel the invaders. Still, he trusted the wisdom of the Council and his master in particular, even though Ell seemed like deep down he wanted to join as well, but for some reason he didn´t. The turning point came when Revan made public knowledge of what had occurred on the planet Cathar, how the Mandalorians had nearly wiped an entire species from th face of the Galaxy and left their planet in ruins. Not able to stand on the side anymore, Yuri left Coruscant and took up the title of Jedi Crusader, joining forces with those already on the front.
Entering the war, Yuri discovered another quality he had yet to see in himself, skill at leadership. Letting his own sense of justice and the Force guide him, his lightsaber would stand alongside republic forces on battlegrounds like Duros and Dxun, and he would even be present when the two fleets finally clashed over Malachor V. Fortunately (as it would turn out), the cruiser he was stationed on were assaulted early in the battle, and while the boarding party was repelled, the ship suffered heavy casualities and were forced to retreat, hanging on the edge of the system when the Mass Shadow Generator were activated, something that most certainly saved it. Still, the sensation that rushed through the Force was incredible, and shook Yuri to his very core. With the war ended, he would quietly slip away from the fleet, becoming lost in the vastness of the Galaxy.
He would not again become involved into the affairs of the Galaxy until a year later, when Revan and Malak returned from Deep Space at the head of a Sith armada. He would be seen spearheading a small mercenary unit fighting against the invaders on various fronts, and eventually his fighting would get him in contact with the Republic forces, and the Jedi who had decided to join with them. Finally, he would stand eye to eye with his master again, ready to accept responsibility for his action. But true to his nature, Zez-Kai Ell would not reprimand his padawan, but he would rather praise him for following his heart and the ways of the Jedi, and told him that he was a living embodiment that perhaos the Council wasn´t always as right as they thought. Leaving the mercenaries to fight the battle in their own way, Yuri rejoined the Jedi and would eventually stand by their side when the war finally ended with Revans redemption. But the war had extracted a cost too heavy for the weakened Order to pay.
In their final conversation, Ell told Yuri that his time had passed, and that he was a Jedi no longer. He would go into exile, and wait for a time of hope, but he would not hold his breath. His final words before he departed was “Even if the Jedi will one day be reborn, the errors of the past must not be repeated, or history will repeat itself. The future rest on the shoulders of you and your kind, my apprentice”. And with this he informally bestowed upon Yuri the title of Jedi Knight, and then left him to find his own place in the Galaxy. And so he did, wandering the Galaxy as a bounty hunter, making sure the ideals of the Jedi remained alive, seeking for trails of the remaining Sith and ways to bring them down, and biding his time for when the Jedi would be needed again.

<details><summary>Appearance</summary>

Yuri has the appearance of a fit human male in his mid-twenties. While he is not overwhelmingly muscular, he is in quite good shape, and he is capable of exerting himself physically for quite a while before having to call upon the Force to assist him, unlike many other Jedi. Up until very recently, he kept his head shaved, but he has since allowed a short stub of hair grow out, though he still keeps his facial hair in check. Well aware that the Galaxy is a dangerous place for Jedi at ther moment, he has adopted a plain, dark clothing, complete with a military-style camouflage poncho, which he usually wear outside-in, to keep its pattern-shifting qualities from attracting attention to him. Since his identity as a Jedi was revealed to those closest around him, he has started wearing his old Jedi robes when in a somewhat more safe environment. The robes are of the more ceremonial cut, the traditional dark brown shades being replaced by white and beige.

<details><summary>Zarim, Outlaw scum and information broker</summary>

**Background** One of the many lowlifes that calls the Smuggler´s Moon home, Zarim was once saved by Yuri from a band of aggressive pirates that apparently didn´t find the Toydarians information to be good enough, and saw fit to express their discontent violently. This created a relationship where Zarim would offer his services and goods to Yuri, and be especially on the alert for any information regarding Jedi or Sith. Miraculously enough, the Toydarian have kept Yuris identity safe, though their relationship has moved away from Zarim owing him anything, and is now more of a business relationship, though usually Yuri can coax the shameless little creature in giving him a better deal than his regular customers.
**Personality** Zarim is defined primarily by three traits: Greed, cunning and cowardice. He has no regrets about being involved in pretty much any kind of business - even though Yuri has managed to get him to back off from the more immoral operations (like slave trade) – as long as he makes money. He knows where to poke his eyes and ears to get results, and takes confidence in that he is protected by the vast amount of knowledge he holds. When provoked though, he is easily scared into submission, even though he manages to keep most people who would like to hurt him at bay by a combination of knowing things about them, and providing them services. Surprisingly enough for such a shady character, he has a strong sense of integrity, and has so far not revealed Yuris identity to anyone.
**Uses** Zarim is quite well-connected on the Smuggler´s Moon, and if there is some piece of information circulating there, it is very likely that he will eventually hear of it. Likewise, he has his fingers in more than a few smuggling and black market operations, making him capable of producing nearly anything...at a price of course. A price that may be pretty steep, even though the Toydarian can get a hold of almost anything at a reduced price.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Daegin**</span>
Male Jawa Scoundrel 6
</div>

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

While he was still an child his family was killed by Tusken Raiders and he was the only survivor. Luckily for him a some moisture farmers saw all of the wreckage and found him. They took him to Mos Eisley hoping that another clan of Jawas would accept him, and when their search was fruitless they left him with some Mon Calamari workers, Oro and Jesmin Till, at the spaceport. He grew up learning about ships and droids from the workers in the spaceport, though most treated him more like a pet than a person, using him to reach places that they could not, or using him to fetch tools and parts for them so that they could continue working. He was given the name Daegin by the workers. He saw many different ships and droids come through the spaceport and when he was finally able to start working for the spaceport he would try to get into as many jobs working on and repairing them as he could. Especially if it was something new that he had never seen before. At times he would get himself into trouble because he would try and tear new tech he saw apart so that he could learn more about it and figure out how it worked. He rarely left the spaceport as he was growing up, which led to him growing rather distant from other Jawas. As a result he tends to be cleaner than other Jawas and because of his life in the spaceport he never got into the habit of dipping his clothes in a rancid soup to help seal in his body's moisture. Then one day his friends, the Mon Calamari that had all but taken him into their home, decided to join up with the Republic to help design, and build ships. Shortly after his friends had left Tattooine to work with the Republic Navy he was approached by Ka'ra and offered a job as a mechanic. Since the only people that he had seen as his family had already left for bigger and better things he decided that it was his turn to leave Tattooine in search for bigger and better things, and of course for new tech that he can tear apart and work on. Though his work on Telia seems slower that working in a spaceport he fills his time with studying tech and he feels that he is allowed to do more since he doesn't have someone constantly over his shoulder yelling at him to get ships, and droids, fixed in a hurry.

</details>

**Appearance**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Standing at only a meter tall and weighing in at 28 kilograms, he is average height but somewhat slender for a Jawa. Unlike most Jawas he does not wear the traditional brown robes. He can normally be found in mechanics coveralls, gloves, boots and a pair of tinted goggles that helps to protect his eyes, their orange glow can still be seen through them. He has a utility belt wrapped around his waist and a holster carrying an ion blaster can be seen on his right hip. A personal translator can be seen strapped around his throat as though it were a throat mic. To a human his face might remind them of a mouse's, or rodent's, face though his ears are proportional to his head, similar to a humans ears and their head. He is covered in short dark grey fur.

They are both smart and creative, and can usually be found together, they seem to work best as a team. They treat designing starships as though they are working on pieces of art. Oro is seen as more of a dreamer, coming up with designs that almost look impractical. He is also very inquisitive. Jesmin is quieter and likes working with computers and droids. She seems to have a natural motherly attitude towards anyone that she works with for an extended amount of time. Though their skills are practically the same Jesmin takes pride in working with the inner workings and coding for computers, while Oro is very proud, and very much enjoys, his work on starship design.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Ooru Okin**</span>
Male Miraluka Jedi 5 / Noble 1
&quot;*All of reality is a canvas to me. I am the brush, the Living Force is my palette&#8230; and the gallery? The gallery is your mind.*&quot;
</div>

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ooru Okin was born the illegitimate son of representative Jor Okin by one of many mistresses. Like his half-brothers and sisters, he never met his parents and was raised instead by Jor's private nurses at a country estate. Unlike them, his mother was a Human and, thanks to her, he had actual eyes. They were vestigial and didn't work, themselves clouded over to give an eery visage to an already odd child. The nurses could tell something was even more uncommon about Ooru though, and after a while many simply refused to be near him. Hallucinations, voices, irrational behavior - these were commonplace for anyone who spent enough time in his presence. The Luka Sene was finally contacted on his fifth birthday when, to the amazement of the nurse staff, he made them all look like each other. It took some time to sort it all out but he was finally whisked away with a guarantee of safety - for everyone. Few ever knew of his true appearance because his face was often covered in traditional Miraluka fashion. Not even his teachers at the academy were aware of his mixed heritage.
As Ooru grew during his time at the institution he realized the unique nuances of his special "Force Sight" - the ability of all Miraluka to perceive their surroundings despite no optical organs - and the nature of his connection to the Living Force. He had a natural aptitude for the aspects of the Force that involved perception and understanding and, through meditation and guided training, learned to control the abilities. Ooru enjoyed studying ancient civilizations and mythologies and in time was able to read a wide array of languages with ease. His interest went beyond the cultures though, and he often adapted what he read for use in his illusions. It became a regular occurence to see Ooru Okin's latest re-enactment of some forgotten battle or long-lost expedition in the halls of the Luka Sene academy. The show was made all the more interesting by his inability to perceive colors naturally - something unexpected but somehow fitting in the young artist. Watching his ghostly pale actors and actresses parade among the shadows of bygone eras was no less enjoyable for their lack of hue.
Ooru loved learning about everything, but particularly life and its many processes. The intricate balance of a body's systems and how each part worked in such harmony was the source of neverending wonder for the young Miraluka. He would often impress his professors by sitting in their classes and providing a detailed construct of an individual system while they taught younger students. One of the few friends he would ever have, a blind Zeltron girl named Vyrna, was more interested in technologies. Though the Luka Sene is typically for Miraluka only, Vyrna's minor nobility and Force sensitivity were welcomed at the academy. They met during class where, to everyone's amazement, Vyrna began to explain the benefits of cybernetic replacements over natural grafts - not a very popular view among Force sensitives. Ooru listened intently, then re-worked his construct to incorporate her suggestions. It was the beginning of a friendship on a level few in the galaxy would ever experience. The two spent countless hours sharing their knowledge, and hearts, through telepathic conversations. It was actually Vyrna who alerted Ooru to the dangerous consequences of his recent studies.
While pouring over old records of ancient traditions, Ooru discovered a small trove of Sith knowledge in the academy archives. It was only a few glyphs and a manuscript, but he spent the better part of a month finding out all he could about the scraps of a history best left forgotten. It was a dark path to walk and he was careful to not delve too deeply. It nonetheless gave him some new and terrible ideas about the use of his powers. Before he could complete his research the academy learned of Ooru's interest in the Sith and determined to confront him about it. Vyrna heard the rumors and, judging her friend was in greater danger from the Sene Seekers than from any scroll, warned him of the academy's plans. Ooru left within the hour with no more than a fleeting telepathic goodbye. He was able to escape the grounds without being noticed and sought passage off-planet at the nearest spaceport. For several he wandered from system to system, continuing his studies as much as possible but always wary of being discovered.
Ooru Okin was contacted about joining Jut-hakk's Brotherhood after narrowly escaping some Sene Seekers that had followed him back to Alpheridies. He was meeting with his childhood companion, Vyrna, who had recently left the academy and would soon be taking a position as one of the planet's lead cyberneticists. The two enjoyed their reunion and soon lapsed into a telepathic conversation like they used to do in years past. The Seekers interrupted and before long Ooru had to flee his homeworld once more - but not before the ember of childhood friendship had been fanned into something more. It was another bittersweet departure but not, they promised, a permanent one. His first year in the Brotherhood was spent under young Master Davian's tutelage from whom he learned to hone his Force abilities and to study some of its basic telekinetic applications. Though it took a great deal of concentration, Ooru eventually learned how to perceive colors and use them in his illusions through guided meditation. His second mentor - Master Tonin, Davian's twin brother - preferred a more direct approach to life's challenges. The twins also gifted Ooru with his robe and lightsaber pike - the trimmings of a great warrior worthy of the Brotherhood. He was deeply honored to be welcomed in any setting for the first time in his memory, and he bore both with great pride. While the majority of his brethren spent their time lifting stones with their minds and participating in saber duels, Ooru perfected his ability to manipulate others' perceptions - and he's became very good at it.

*By the time you receive this report I will be on Alpheridies. You've surely heard about Davian, believe me when I say I did everything I could think of to revive him. I have to admit, however, that his condition may be partially due to my own reckless actions aboard the derelict shuttle where we encountered Master Jut-Haak. It was… difficult. Lanius' burns have healed but the burden on my own conscience remains. I don't know what else you've heard so I'll just recount as best I can.
I updated you about halfway through my mission when I had met with little success. Eventually we were able to trace Davian to a small craft drifting among the asterooids near where Acheron Base had been. We decided to enter the ship, cautiously, and immediately discovered signs of struggle - such as it was. The two pilots' corpses were still strapped in and had clearly been injured through The Force rather than any physical weapon. I sent an illusionary figure of Lanius down into the bay below to spring any waiting ambush, to which we were met with the unmistakable laughter of Jut-Haak. We proceeded slowly, only to find Davian's body on the deck of the bay - and no one else. He gasped for air and recognized me - briefly - before Jut-Haak worked his trickery over Davian's body and the confrontation began. In the end it was Lanius perseverance more than anything I did that allowed us to leave still breathing. I stabalized Davian and Lanius brought us back here to Telia V. It's been a full day since our return and after a great deal of meditation and introspection I have decided that I must rectify events from my past. The Sene Seekers aren't likely to give up searching and it just may turn out that The Force has a better plan for me than whatever I might come up with on my own. I can't hope to defeat whatever Master Jut-Haak has become if I'm bring haunted by ghosts in my own past.
I sincerely hope this meets with your approval… and understanding. Nothing could change my devotion to you, Davian, or the Brotherhood. I fear, though, that my own shortcomings may endanger us all if not reconciled. I will be in touch as necessary. Ooru out.*
**<Recording concluded>**
Ooru's decision to return to Alpheridies and face his accusers at the Luka Sene has met with many unexpected - but not unwelcome - surprises. The administration was understanding of his fears and applauded his facing them rather than burying them deep - a sure path to the Dark Side. His confession, and subsequent forgiveness, freed Ooru to pursue a less self-centered path. That, however, was only one reason to return to his homeworld. Vyrna, now a well-known cyberneticist specializing in life-saving technologies, was excited to finally have some uninterrupted time with Ooru. The two shared many things together, sometimes in pleasant conversation, sometimes in quiet meditation, always growing closer. Ooru decided on a few more changes he hadn't anticipated as well: He stopped wearing the traditional Miralukan head covering and let his piercing eyes be seen freely. He left his black and orange robe and saberpike, gifts from Davian and Tonin, back on Telia V and chose a more humble attire. A special silver lightsaber - a gift from Vyrna - is the only weapon he now carries. He keeps the Kinrath barb that once very nearly killed him stored in its hilt - a reminder of his own mortality. The purposeful expulsion of Sith teachings from his mind resulted in his growing in the understanding of The Living Force, and he has gained the use of Force-assisted healing and an increased ability to perceive the environment around him - among other new abilities. Clarity has come to Ooru Okin and he is now ready to face his destiny, whatever it may be.

**Appearance**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ooru Okin is a 25-year-old Miralukan of athletic build. His muscle lays taught across his thin frame and, while he by no means would boast of amazing strength or agility, he has a certain attractiveness in his wiry, almost elven, appearance. His hair hangs loose around his shoulders, well-kept and dark. Ooru's hybrid genetics grant him a pair of solid black eyes, setting him quite apart from his fellow Miralukans. They are vestigial - a result of his Human mother's physiology - and few knew of their existence until recently. Like windows into some bottomless chasm, they lend him an alien appearance unsurpassed in its savage beauty. He is content to dress comfortably in a simple tunic and pants as well, shunning fashion for function out of a desire to both rebel against the status quo and be able to blend into a crowd as best as possible.
When on assignment for the Brotherhood he wears a black hooded robe with deep orange trim - a gift from Master Davian. His lightsaber pike was a gift from Master Tonin, and it's dark handle and bright orange blade rarely see much combat. When not active it simply completes the picture of a stereotypical blind traveler. It's an image he encourages, since his dismissal often avoids unnecessary confrontation. More recently, however, he has shunned their use in a sort of self-imposed exile from the Brotherhood whereby he hopes to resolve a number of dangers to both it and those he cares about most. He travels light - what doesn't fit in his medical pack goes into his belt. When things get intense those nearby discover an intriguing - and sometimes frightening - manifestation of Ooru's powers. His appearance is often reflective of his mood: subliminal and emotional currents impact his attire and surroundings visibly. The result only adds to his already mysterious countenance and unmistakable presence.

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Kal was born in the ecumenopolis of Taris. His parents, established traders supplying Vanquo and Jebble, provided him a comfortable life. From birth, his parents noticed that he is different from other children. The unexplained movement of objects when he’s mad and his unerring ability in finding his playmates in every game of hide and seek was beyond explanation even to himself.
Everything became clear when a Jedi Sentinel on a mission on Taris met him and explained to him his gift. He secretly underwent training in the Jedi arts and was indoctrinated in the philosophy of the Unifying Force.
As a Padawan learner, he assisted his master in ferreting information on lost artifacts with his natural charisma being of advantage.
If not for the onset of the Mandalorian Wars which led to his Master being assigned elsewhere, he would have progressed further as a Jedi. With the war looming over Taris, people started to panic. Some, however, took advantage. A Mandalorian bomb allegedly exploded in his parent’s office killing them both. Using his investigation skills, he managed to trace the culprit, a competitor in their trading business. He forwarded his complaint with the authorities but being young and an orphan, his opponent well connected, his pleadings fell on deaf ears.
As if by twist of fate, his parent’s murderer somehow suffered an unexplained death. Being the only known person with a motive, he was incarcerated pending trial.
When the Mandalorians invaded Taris, all prisoners were freed with the option of being slaves or join the war in the service of the Mando’ade. Kal chose the latter. Being of young age and with his innate agility, he was trained in reconnaissance and espionage by the Neo-Crusaders. It seemed his young age saved him from a grisly fate in Jebble. He served the Mando’ade until the end of the war all the while concealing his aptitude in the Force.
When the Mandalorians lost in the Battle of Malachor V, his unit was one of the few who managed to escape.
Instead of going back to Mandalore, Kal’s unit decided to stay in the Outer Rim and eked out a living as a Mercenary Group.
It is during this lull time when he Kal discovered the trust fund set up for him by his parents in the form of stock investments in Aratech Repuslor Company.
Though he could not consider the resources a windfall, it provided a steady influx of credits which he used to purchase better equipment. This in turn enabled him to acquire fatter contracts for himself and his team.
When Revan returned as Dark Lord of the Sith and started the Jedi Civil War, his mercenary unit decided to side with the Republic offering their services for difficult missions. This gave them the chance to get even with enemy that decimated them in the previous war. This opportunity also gave him a deeper sense of purpose.
With the end of the war, Kal and his unit returned to their lives as guns for hire. After a few months of accepting work from anyone who could afford their price, Kal became disenchanted with his life as a mercenary.
With a heavy heart, he bid his comrades goodbye and went off to Nar Shaddaa to try his luck there. To his dismay, he still ended up as a mercenary. The only consolation he had was that he gets to choose his assignments.
One notable assignment he had was when he was approached by a contact to rescue a Sluissi weapon and armor designer working for the Czerka Corporation. The initial payout was minimal but the long term reward was promised to be worth the risk. True to his contact’s word, the Sluissi turned out more useful than expected. Eventually, Kal didn’t just earn a new contact, he won a friend.
A few months later, Kal felt again the nagging emptiness in his existence. It is during this time that he was visited by a ghostly apparition of his former master who revealed that he was killed by the Sith and is now in the realms of the Force. He is goading Kal to continue his training in the Force and instructed him to trust in the Force and search his feelings to find his true purpose in life.

**Background:**
Salish was born to a family renowned for their brilliant ideas and innovations in ship design. At a young age, his great intellect has garnered him several accolades for his designs. However, he realized that there are plenty of Sluissi ship designers already and wanted to have a special niche in the field of weapons and armor designs.
Despite the threat of being disowned by his family, Salish left Sluis Van to work for Czerka Corporation as a weapons and armor designer. Much to his chagrin, his employment turned out to be an imprisonment wherein much of his personal freedom was greatly curtailed.
Not wanting to live such a life, he managed to hire someone to extract him from his employer with no payments up front.
He setup shop at Nar Shadda under the protection of Torga the Hutt, creating various weapons, armors and gadgets to all who could meet his asking price.
**Uses:** Equipment Supplier for both legal and illegal goods. Equipment customization. Information trade.
Although he is a well-known logistics and acquisitions expert, Salish in essence, is a creator of technological wonders. It is said that his creation could be considered a technological advancement in the next 2 decades. He has an broad client base ranging from law enforcement officers to notorious bounty hunters. Though his price is steep, all customers are satisfied.
**Personality:**
As a safety measure, Salish don’t deal directly with his clients, often going through an extensive network of middlemen. For those close enough to him which he meets personally, he exhibits a dour demeanor which is quite unheard of amongst the normally jolly and easy going Sluissi species. In reality, this is just a show since friendliness is usually considered a weakness in the smuggler’s moon.

It is through the Sluissi that Kal came to know of Janex.

Janex’ access to the Jedi Temple’s mainframe grants him a massive information resource. His computer connection with the Coruscant Police gives an updated supply of data.
