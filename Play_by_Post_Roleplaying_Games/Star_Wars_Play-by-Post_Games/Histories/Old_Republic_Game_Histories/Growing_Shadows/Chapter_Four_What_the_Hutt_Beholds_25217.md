# Chapter Four: What the Hutt Beholds

### **Alicia** (2012-04-24 15:50:17)

One could say the library is as unchanging as the stone it was carved out of, though that’s hardly true for as the days go on, the residents of the facility bring with them their gathered knowledge adding to the collection. While most of the faces found within are the same there’s always the few newcomers who have come for their own reasons.
Daegin would recognize them all, if not know them by name having spent some time working on the transports which dropped them off before leaving for other missions. Others have vessels which have since been hidden in the jungle’s depths till their owners come to claim them generally having the maintenance crews in the bay look over it before departing.
Having made his way through the natural corridors and deeper into the mountain, the Jawa has little trouble pushing large double doors aside. Rows of datastores, and even a few bookshelves are neatly spaced in the cavern turned library. Suffice to say, the library is an impressive collection. In the center a few tables with computer panels have been set up for the studious Brothers. Arriving early, there’s no sign Ka’ra has made her way here as of yet.

---

Ka’ra seems about to say something and then thinks better of it as she stands and makes her way toward the door. The young woman seems to know the maze-like tunnels well and has no issues leading Ooru to the large double doors which leads to the library. Stopping short of opening them, she turns to the Miraluka. “**I understand the desire to help friends and finding that attempts turn out less than ideal. What happened to Davian is not your fault. No one expected Jut-hakk to be able to cheat his death and take over Davian’s body.**”

---

### **Duggs** (2012-05-01 16:37:16)

He takes a quick look around the library and after he doesn't see Ka'ra anywhere he begins to browse through the collections of books and datastores. After spending a few minutes looking around he moves over and takes a seat at one of the tables and thumbs through files that he has on his datapad. Though one question keeps running through his mind... *What could Ka'ra want to talk to me about?*

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-01 20:10:54)

The point is well-made, and Ooru has long struggled over feeling guilty for what happened to Davian. It wasn't his fault of course, and he knew that, but the wondering if he could have handled things differently was always there. He has the opportunity now to prevent Jut-Haak causing further harm to his friends, and countless others, and simply intends to keep that his goal rather than the destruction of anything - or anyone.
"**You're right, Ka'ra. Whether he's using the same trick again or not, we'll soon find out I guess. It's just easier to succeed at rescues and keeping people safe than it is to destroy ancient artifacts. Or maybe not, I don't know. I just think Lanius is probably not the first - or last - to want the Force Harvester destroyed. Even with it out of the picture though I think Jut-Haak would just find another way to inflict pain and suffering. I'd rather see him restored to reason if at all possible. I'll try my best to follow your lead though, whatever happens.**"
He takes a deep breath, adjusts his grip on the shoulder strap of his pack, and waits for Ka'ra to make her entrance.

### **Alicia** (2012-05-01 23:35:29)

Ka’ra nods and smiles at Ooru, a hint of the young, carefree girl she used to be appearing in the glint of her blue eyes, then she turns toward the door and it’s gone. The door opens easily at her touch. The sanctuary within is much as Ooru remembers it however there seems to be more milling about than on his first venture within. Bent over one of the consoles Ooru recognizes the aging Draethos, though the master doesn’t look up to acknowledge the newcomers.
Striding in, Ka’ra catches the attention of the waiting Jawa mechanic, though it takes a moment to recognize her out of her armor, and indicates for him to follow them into the back where meditation rooms await use. There’s only two rooms available, the other three rooms have red indicators signifying their occupancy and picking the closest one Ka’ra heads in.
The meditation rooms themselves are simple with high ceilings which have been untouched by the facilities builders - small stalactites spot the rocky recesses. An array of cushions in a corner of the room are provided to make the occupant comfortable on the rock floor, which is strangely warm to the touch. Adjsuting the lights to a comfortable level Ka’ra waits for both of her ‘guests’ to enter before locking the door behind them.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-02 06:37:59)

Ooru is glad to see Odan-Urr present, even if only in passing. He has many things to be thankful for and the aged Draethos' acquaintance is not least among them. A smaller team member - a Jawa, typically from the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine if memory serves correctly - joins the pair and Ooru nods and smiles in acknowledgement but keeps quiet, unaware of the true nature of the gathering as of yet.
Reaching the all-to-familiar meditation chambers, Ooru enters and takes a seat on one of the cushions and waits for Ka'ra to begin. His pack rests on the warm stone floor beside him.

---

### **Duggs** (2012-05-02 07:11:47)

After Ka'ra indicates for him to follow her, he gets up and puts his datapad back in one of the pouches on his belt and walks over to join Ka'ra and the newcomer following her. When he gets up to the group he looks up at Ooru and gives him a nod back as they walk into the meditation room. Once in the room he takes a seat on one of the cushions and waits for Ka'ra to talk about what is going on.

---

### **Alicia** (2012-05-03 17:30:36)

Finding her own seat, Ka'ra leans against one of the walls and lets out a tired sigh. "**It's safe enough here to talk freely, these rooms were designed to be sound proof.**" Glancing between the two she indicates each in turn as she continues, "**Ooru. Daegin. Lanius and I believe you have have something to offer toward an important meeting. It's our hope we’ll get valuable intel involving the Force Harvester.**” Pausing for a moment she makes sure to have both of the men’s attention.
“**An agent has already made his way to Nar Shaddaa where he’s been in contact with Torga the Hutt, unfortunately he won’t meet with us until we pass an interview with one of his trusted subordinates. Torga is to act as mediator between us and one of his associates, a smuggler called Hoggon who about a decade ago managed to find where Ulic Qel-Droma went into exile. Ultimately Lanius believes Qel-Droma might have left information on how to deal with the Force Harvester.**”

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-03 18:52:21)

Ooru lets Ka'ra's words sink in before responding. Hutts weren't the most trustworthy beings in the galaxy but they always seemed to have a way of brokering exclusive information. Hopefully it was worth more to Torga to help Lanius than to just double-cross him. If they already had an agent in place it's probably as safe a setup as it was going to get, but still...
"**Are you expecting trouble at the meeting?**" he asks, glancing between Ka'ra and the Jawa, Daegin.

---

### **Duggs** (2012-05-03 21:41:46)

He shakes his head when Ka'ra mentions a Hutt. "**I have never liked dealing with Hutts. They are always shady, and most only help you if it helps them in some way. Let's just hope that we are the only oned that want this information from Torga.**"
After Ooru speaks he says in reply, "**I hope there isn't too much trouble. I am not sure how well I will be in a fight… I mean I have taken down rogue droids with my ion pistol, but I haven't fought too many people that had the intention of killing me first.**"

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-05 08:28:04)

Ooru nods at Daegin's last comment.
"**Me neither. I think we could manage to hold our own if needs be - one tends to surprise oneself once battle begins - but I'm afraid we'd lose whatever bargain we had with Torga if we killed one of his own. Of course, Hutts can be deceptive that way… maybe he'd be impressed.**"
*At least it won't be a ghost. That part comes later on, I imagine…*
The Miraluka's eyebrows raise as he turns back to Ka'ra and awaits a response.

---

### **Duggs** (2012-05-07 08:50:26)

"**I can understand Huttese, so I will make sure that Torga doesn't try and use his translator to tell us lies. Who is our agent that met with Torga?**"
He runs his hands through the fur covering his head and then looks up at Ka'ra.

---

### **Alicia** (2012-05-08 09:37:36)

"**We won't have to worry about the Hutt deceiving us. It would be bad for business and we all know how Hutts like their business. Aside from that it seems the majority of us know the Hutt language so he can't hide that way, your translator makes doubly sure of that,**" she points out. "**As for expecting trouble. I always do, particularly since reports indicate Torga has been receiving death threats, which could mean if things break out while we're there it's possible we'll get caught in the middle.**"
Ka'ra shifts uncomfortably as she continues. "**The agent there is Yuri, I doubt you've met him,**" she comments to Daegin. "**He hasn't made his way to Telia yet.**"

---

### **Duggs** (2012-05-08 18:06:54)

**"Let us hope we don't step into the middle of an assassination attempt."** His look goes blank for a second as he thinks. **"Though saving Torga's life could help us out with getting the information we need from him.**
**"What do we know, or what do we need to know, about this Agent Yuri?"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-09 06:23:59)

Ooru is content to listen to the conversation since his only real question - whether to expect trouble or not - has already been answered. Considering the likelihood of combat, he's grateful for the time to study the healing arts more in depth. If there is a double-cross, or an ambush, or if it's a setup, he's confident they'll be able to get out intact - Ka'ra doesn't really look like someone who'd get in over her head.
*Not too much anyway…* he thinks, noting Ka'ra's physique and having nominal knowledge of Mandalorian prowess. *Having a Hutt in their debt would be handy, but if rescuing him means earning a death mark ourselves so early in the mission it may be wise to just call Torga a hostage and interrogate him later…*

---

### **Alicia** (2012-05-10 21:24:25)

"**We'll leave immediately once the *Atin Oya'ka* arrives, which should be arriving soon.**" The name sounds familiar to Daegin, not so much to Ooru. The *Atin Oya'ka* is a Citadel-class cruiser owned by Ka'ra the Jawa has worked on once before, though its been awhile since he's seen it. It left a few months ago with its pilot, Tanith Hoagra and the Ithorian Jedi Tandeau Mimwen aboard.
"**As for Yuri, he's been working with Lanius and myself for the last few months. He's been using is contacts on Nar Shaddaa to great effect in this endeavor. Other than that, I'm afraid it's not for me to tell.**" She shrugs lightly with that thought and moves to stand. "**If there's nothing else, ner vod, we should finish any preparations before we leave.**"

---

### **Duggs** (2012-05-10 21:31:11)

He gives Ka'ra a nod and then pulls out his datapad and scrolls through some of his notes on the *Atin Oya'ka*. He mumbles to himself, though his translator still picks it up and then spits it out where the others can hear. "**Good ship… Been a while though, hopefully she is still running as well as when I last saw her.**" He then reaches up and turns off his translator.
After scrolling through his notes he gets up and starts his way to his quarters so that he can pack all of his gear and get ready for travel.
*Hopefully this transaction runs smoothly…*

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-11 19:54:23)

Before standing, Ooru reflects on the last time a mission started in one of the meditation chambers here on Telia V. He was sent by Master Tonin to find Davian and Jut-Haak of course, but the first real clues as to how to proceed took place not too far from the very spot he was sitting.
*Let's hope things work out better this time…*
"**So Ka'ra,**" he begins, getting to his feet, "**I'd like to here about you and Lanius - how you two met up and such. He seemed disconnected last time we were out and I haven't really spoken a word to him since I've returned. I imagine all this is pretty hard to process but has he always been so…**"
*What's the word…*
"**…stoic?**"
It's a lame attempt at small talk to be sure but caring for one's teammates is easier if you actually know something about them and Ooru doesn't really know Lanius - or Ka'ra or Daegin for that matter - very well at all. The *Atin Oya'ka* - whatever that means - is sure to be a busy ship from here on out and there may not be much time to find out who these people really are. Since their stated mission is to save all life in the galaxy, and considering the opposition they're likely to face, camaraderie will prove as integral as anything else - perhaps even moreso.

### **Alicia** (2012-05-11 20:41:29)

“**Don’t worry, Daegin. Tanith has been taking good care of her,**” Ka’ra assures the Jawa as she rises. With the mechanic now distracted she leaves him to his thoughts. Motioning for Ooru to join her, she leaves the meditation chamber at an even pace toward the section of the facility where the permanent residents are quartered. Ooru soon finds himself on a similar path he had taken with Odan-Urr a couple months before.
As she walks she can’t help but laugh at the Miraluka’s description of Lanius. “**Lanius tends to take things very seriously, yes. He puts forth a mask of stoicism to hide the truth,**” she pauses as she rounds a corner and gives a sideways glance at Ooru. “**He cares too much.**”
Now on the first floor, Ooru is greeted by the familiar sight of the door filled corridor and he notices there are more panels lit up this time than there were on his last visit.

---

### **Alicia** (2012-05-11 21:52:47)

"**Well I can understand that. We've all got a vested interest in saving the galaxy and he seems to be the man most responsible for getting that done.**" Turning the corner, it becomes evident to Ooru that there really are more people here than last time. More permanent residents anyway. "**And he hasn't been idle…**"
Ka’ra nods at Ooru’s words but doesn’t make a remark to her increase in neighbors. Stopping at her door to the quarters she shares with Lanius, she quickly punches in her code. “**You’re welcome to come in…**” she says at last.
He follows her into the quarters, remembering the last time he was here. Lanius already knew about what he and Odan-Urr had done - most of it anyway - but it still felt odd.
*And we return to the scene of the crime…*
But he knew that wasn't entirely true. They had done what was necessary to find Lanius and Davian and that was that. "**Thanks. I don't imagine Lanius is around, is he? I don't want to get too far ahead in planning with everyone assembled but it might be a good idea to catch up on the latest regarding our… late Master.**"
*I suppose that's an acceptable description of Jut-Haak. Crazy-laughing-ghost-with-an-Armageddon-device might work too…*
The quarters are much the way Ooru remembers it, except now there’s signs of recent habitation; a tray of neatly stacked dishes on the table from a hasty meal is evidence of that. “**No, Lanius is currently working on a project. Even I haven’t seen him in almost a month,**” she says with a hint of sadness as she walks in behind her guest. “**I won’t take long. Make yourself comfortable,**” she remarks indicating the chairs next to the table, the only real sitting area here.
"**Thanks.**" replies Ooru, though he continues standing. The smell of strill is noticeably present but much less so than last time - which is appreciated. He wanders over to the shelves of assorted files and logs and peruses them, mostly just passing time until Ka'ra returns. Spotting the frame of her "family" he wonders what it must be like to grow up surrounded by a group of people so dedicated to each other's well-being. He'd never really met his family since they sent him off to join the Luka Sene and wasn't entirely sure how many other children - legitimate or otherwise - his father actually had.
*But I've got Vyrna at least.*
The two had always been fond of each other but the last few months on Alpheridies had been more than just visiting an old friend. They were close now in ways that Ooru had never really considered before - but that's usually how it happens. He couldn't imagine what the Force had in store for the two of them but he was sure it was something big. Whether it had anything to do with a Force Harvester or not.
Disappearing into the bedroom Ka’ra is true to her word and soon returns. She’s donned her armor, the black-purple plates making her physique even more impressive. A satchel is tossed haphazardly over one shoulder with a large heavy rifle. Her helmet is tucked under an arm and she looks out at Ooru with a bit of amusement as he pokes through the collection of texts lining the shelves. “**I don’t think Lanius would mind if you want to borrow something.**” Moving toward the desk, she shifts a stack of datapads revealing the dust underneath to which she tsks.
"**Oh, no thanks, I was just looking around. I'd always wondered though,**" he says, walking over in front of the nebula artwork, "**What the significance of this is. Do you know? Odan-Urr mentioned it had some importance to Lanius but I've no idea where it is.**"
He regards Ka'ra with a new sense of awe and respect now that she's wearing her battle armor. "**Also… I'm glad I'm on your side.**" he chuckles.
Ka'ra follows with her gaze as he approaches the large picture. "**I gave him the picture,**" she says, laughing lightly at his sentiment. "**Most don't like to find themselves on the badside of a Mandalorian. Are you ready?**" she asks, dodging his inquiry concerning the picture's significance.

### **Duggs** (2012-05-12 00:14:34)

He makes it back to his room and he takes some time checking all of his gear and making sure everything is tidied up before he leaves.
*It is always good to come back to a clean living area.*
As soon as he finishes cleaning and packing his bag he slowly works his way to the hanger so he can make sure that all of his tools are put away and his work space is cleaned up. He takes his time with it as he waits for the *Atin Oya'ka* to show up so that they can load up and head out.

Daegin doesn't have to wait long as the Citadel-class cruiser is already waiting in the hanger bay when he arrives. The ramp is lowered and the human male the Jawa recognizes as Tanith Hoagra is attempting to perform some last minute maintenance.
Standing at an average height, Tanith can't be more than 29 standard years. However, his dark hair is starting to grey at the temples, and his brown eyes are troubled- betraying the things he’s seen and the depth of his thoughts. The armor he currently sports is patched, faded, and well worn as are his pistols. Drawing closer the mechanic can hear the pilot's incessant cursing as he welds a spare plate to the hull.

### **Duggs** (2012-05-12 01:50:28)

He trots over to Tanith to offer his help. As soon as he gets to Tanith he spits out something in his fast Jawa language, once he doesn't hear his translator kick in he reaches up and turns it back on and then goes to speak again. "**How are you doing Tanith? It has been a while since I saw you last. How has the *Atin Oya'ka* been treating you? Could you use any help before we put her back into space?**"
After that last question he sets his bag on the floor and waits patiently for Tanith to give him an answer.
*He looks like he hasn't been doing too well… Hopefully all is well with him…*

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-12 05:30:44)

"**I think so.**" he replies, glancing back over the array of documents and artifacts. It was a bad habit to get into, going into people's quarters unannounced and rummaging through their belongings, but Ooru had felt the first time was necessary and this second time - well Ka'ra was here too. A thought occurs:
"**Any recommended reading?**" he half-jokes, motioning to the shelf in the front room full of texts. "**It might help if I could take a look at whatever Lanius has about the Force Harvester…?**"
Ooru lets the words trail off, not knowing how to ask for anything more specific. He could easily see several inscriptions that he couldn't read, but spare time and some determination were good cures for the boredom of hyperspace travel.
*Plus* he thinks, *it might help if I ever run into Jut-Haak again like he promised…*

---

### **Alicia** (2012-05-14 00:27:14)

Tanith jumps with a start as he hears the Jawa start his high pitched voice from behind him; his reaction nearly causes him to drop the welder. Glancing behind him, the pilot takes in the sight of the Jawa mechanic before turning off the torch and lowering the protective googles. “**Oh, there you are Squeaky,**” he says affectionately. “**This plate’s been coming loose every time I hit atmo. Wish the lass would give me some time to get this bucket fitted properly. What’d ya think?**”
Drawing closer, Deagin can spot with his trained eye that this section of the hull has been patched numerous times. At some point since he’s seen the *Atin Oya’ka* has been in combat and barely managed to avoid what could have been a devastating blow. Perhaps a testament to the pilot’s training.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

As an aside I’ve always imagined Tanith with a southern accent. Maybe because his player was from the south, but just go with it!

Ka’ra was getting ready to head for the door, when Ooru’s question on any recommended reading stops her. At the request for some data relating to the Force Harvester, she considers for a moment. “**I’m afraid he’s encoded most of it, not even sure where he’s hidden it.**” With a shrug she adds. “**Since I’m not sure what interests you, I can’t exactly recommend anything. I do ask whatever you decide take you leave on the ship.**”

The objects prove to be little more than knick-knacks the young man has collected and the books seems to be personal copies of things one might find in the library, mostly literary works. Several of them are in languages Ooru doesn’t recognize, though one seems to be an old text written in the same language as Ka’ra’s datapads.

### **Duggs** (2012-05-14 10:43:35)

He lets out a small smile when he hears the name "Squeaky". He spends a minute looking at the section that Tanith is working on. "**Looks like you had a pretty close call out there. Luckily you are good pilot. Let me give you a hand with this.**" He pulls out his tools and helps Tanith get the plate put back together as well as they can before they take off again.
*Hopefully we can get this patched up before we need to take off… We could use a little more time to make sure that this bird is fully ready to go…*
"**Any other issues with the *Atin Oya'ka* that you would like me to look at before we go?**"

"**Good point.**"
Ooru concedes the dilemma and decides to go with one of the more older looking selections. Like many of the others, he can't read the language but once a student always a student.
"**This looks as good as anything else I suppose.**" He chooses one with script that seems to resemble that in some of the datapads by the desk. Whether it's Mando'a or not isn't for him to say but it's likely someone aboard the *Atin* could help him translate if time permits. "**Maybe I can squeeze some more information out of you or Lanius about that nebula,**" Ooru points to the painting, "**but now's not the time for an art critique. After you.**" The Miralukan grabs his bag once more and waits to follow Ka'ra out to the waiting ship.

While Tanith is an exceptional mechanic in his own right, his skill can’t compare to the Jawa’s professional skill. It’s not long before the plate has been welded into the larger hull and aside from the edging it looks like it was always there. It was unlikely it would be going anywhere any time soon.
“**Maybe you could take a look at the sensors, they’ve been acting up.**” Gathering his equipment, the pilot motions for the Jawa to follow muttering something about troublesome mechanics who cause more problems than fix. The controls for the sensor array is located near the engineering section at the rear of the ship. Still muttering to himself, the pilot leaves him to it taking the ladder up to the main level and presumably to the cockpit.
Opening up the access panel, Deagin quickly realizes at some point someone had added to the system and then removed the component which had been installed there. The result was a mess of wiring. It wouldn’t be a far stretch to believe somewhere the wiring got crossed.

---

Ka’ra glances at the title and nods approvingly. “**That was always my favorite, though I’m surprised you can read Mando’a.**” Hefting her satchel she frowns at Ooru before turning toward the door and opening it. “**Why are you so curious about the nebula? It’s just a place the two of us have been.**”

### **Duggs** (2012-05-16 14:20:31)

He keeps up with Tanith's pace as he makes his way to the control panel. He reaches up and turns off his translator as he begins to cuss whoever had created this jumble of wires.
*I can't believe someone would be this careless with a component as vital as your sensors…*
He doesn't want to create any issues as he rewires everything so he makes sure to look over everything and get a good grasp on what he is working on. He takes his time working on getting all of the wires laid out properly and put into their proper places. The whole time he works he cusses whoever it was that created this mess.
*I will have to ask Tanith who did this… I definitely have a few words for whoever it was that did this…*

"**I can't, technically, but there's only one way to learn I guess!**" replies Ooru with a smirk. Realizing Ka'ra was taking offense to his inquiries regarding the artwork, he holds his hands up in mock defeat: "**Forgive me - I didn't mean anything by it. I'm just the naturally curious type. At least I am before… whatever it is we're about to do. Save the galaxy?**" It's a silly joke, and a poor one at that, but the seriousness of the task at hand is not lost on Ooru - nor, likely, Ka'ra.
*I wonder if I'll actually have the time to study this any*, he thinks, packing the aged book, *or will it just be dead weight to carry around? All the things I've learned in my short time in the galaxy and I'm constantly surprised by how much more there always is. That bit of Sith lore almost cost me everything - will our encounter with the Force Harvester be the same?*

Sorry it took me so long guys, I've been fighting some sort of head illness for the better part of two weeks and adjusting to this new work schedule is still making me wonky.

### **Alicia** (2012-05-23 17:14:00)

Ka'ra nods, easily forgiving the Miraluka. Turning to head out into the hallway she glances sideways at Ooru. "**The book is a compilation of some of our oral tales, at least our more important ones. I would very much appreciate it if you didn't lose it.**"
The walk to the hanger takes very little time and it's hard to miss the large cruiser that is the *Atin Oya'ka*. Nearby is a smaller fighter which the deckhands are loitering around. Spotting them, Ka'ra let's out a sigh of annoyance and starts over. "**Go ahead and report to Tanith. Tell him I'm ready when he is,**" she says in parting words before making a beeline for the fighter putting on her helmet as she went. Upon spotting her approach, all but one of the hands scatter. After some exchanged words the remaining deckhand moves away and Ka'ra gets in the fighter.
Boarding the lowered ramp, Ooru is greeted by the sight of an expansive cargo bay. Palates of secured crates and other cargo are laid out across the bay with a speeder bike secured to the side of the ramp. From further into the ship, he can hear the tall tell squeaks of Jawese. Passing through an opened heavy bulkhead door and down a hallway the Miraluka spots the Jawa knee deep in wires and half hidden by a panel.

It takes all of the Jawa's patience but finally he makes sense of the mess of wires and components putting them back into their proper place one at a time. The sensors themselves are advanced for this type of ship and there's something else the mechanic can't place as he assesses the component. Near completion of his task Deagin isn't so distracted to hear the sounds of someone approaching from down the hall.

He keeps working until he is completely done rewiring the panel. As he finishes he steps back from the panel, shaking his head at it and the mess he just fixed. He looks over towards where he heard the footsteps coming from and once he realizes it is Ooru he gives him a nod and a small smile.
*I need to talk to Tanith about what happened with the sensors…*
He buttons the panel back up and puts away his tools, and then gets ready to make his way to the cockpit.

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-25 06:45:57)

"**You got it.**" says Ooru, winking at Ka'ra. It was his experience that stories often had some basis in truth and hoped that held for the Mando'a tales as well.
Watching her make for the fighter craft, Ooru board the much larger *Atin Oya'ka* and spots Daegin. He returns the greeting with one of his own and makes for the nearest unoccupied bunk to stow his gear. It only takes a few moments to find a locker for his pack and so he locks the hatch in the *open* position to listen and watch for Ka'ra - or anyone else - to come aboard. He passes the time resting on the bunk and leafing through the pages of the text, trying half-heartedly to discern any notable linguistic patterns or common phrases.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Let's try an **Intelligence** roll to see if the GM will allow Ooru to notice anything, shall we? He's a linguist, among other things, after all...

### **Duggs** (2012-05-25 07:08:11)

After Ooru continues on to find his bunk Daegin makes his way towards the cockpit to see if he can find Tanith and ask him a few questions about the sensor assembly.
*Hopefully Tanith knows what has happened to the wiring here…
I hope it wasn't sabotage…*
He walks with as fast a pace, without running, as his little legs will carry him. If he passes others he will give them a nod as he passes.

<div style="text-align: right;">

</div>

If he's looking for the closest bunk, Ooru doesn't have far to go as there's an open door near to where he's found the Jawa which he realizes leads to a barracks consisting of five double bunks, an adjacent refresher, lockable lockers for storage and a small communal living area. Taking a bunk in the barracks, Ooru does have a good vantage to listen for the comings of any remaining crew. He does hear the sounds of the boarding ramp close and the engines reaching the end of their warm up cycle. It would seem that Ka'ra would not be traveling on board the *Atin Oya'ka*. With his attention diverted elsewhere, his halfhearted attempts to make sense of the language just end up making the Miraluka more confused, however he notices that the author took the time to provide some very graphic illustrations. The very first story entitled "Akaanati'kar'oya" shows an illustration of an entire world half in ash while two beings, obviously gods, fight each other causing turmoil to the planet. One of the gods is covered in fire, his expression wrathful and carries a war ax. The other was drawn in cool, muted colors giving the figure a lazy look and the spear he holds seems to be holding the fiery cataclysm on the planet at bay.
There's several more illustration of the same two gods through out the story, both seeming to always fight each other until finally the last picture shows an armored figure standing victoriously over their presumably dead bodies.
As Deagin heads up the ladder to the upper level and makes his way through a long corridor of about a half a dozen doors before entering a larger, empty lounge, he realizes there is no one else on the ship. Entering the cockpit, the mechanic is greeted by a slight nod from Tanith as his hands move smoothly over the controls. Preflight checks from the looks of it are nearly complete. "**Ah good. I just got the green light from the sensors. Working much better. Could probably see a flea on a Strill's head now!**" The pilot laughs at his own joke before flipping on the com to the entirety of the ship
"***Prepare for departure, should be a smooth 'nough leaving atmo. There'll be a slight delay while the lass docks her fighter 'fore we jump to lightspeed.***" The intercom clicks off and it's not long before the ship is taking off out of the rock hewn docking bay.

---

### **Duggs** (2012-05-25 13:15:03)

He chuckles at Tanith's joke and then walks over to take a seat in the empty chair next to Tanith. He reaches up and turns on his translator and gives it a second before he starts talking. "**I was wondering what you knew about the mechanic that worked on the sensors before? There seemed to have been a module installed, and then subsequently removed from the sensors, that left the whole panel looking like a jumbled mess.**" He looks around for a minute taking notice to the fact that he hasn't seen anyone else on the ship. "**Where is the rest of the crew, or are we the only ones traveling with you this time?**"

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-25 13:55:07)

The illustrations provide an interesting look at Mando'a psychology - and most probably eschatology of some sort. He would have to ask Ka'ra or Lanius about it some time. He stows the book for now and makes his way topside for the jump to lightspeed. The ship layout isn't too hard to obtain from a nearby vidscreen where Ooru keys the comms to the cockpit:
"**Sounds good, pilot, thanks. Any idea how long it'll take to get where we're going?**"
He switches over to his own comlink to wait for a response as he makes his way to the area behind the cockpit. Even if the pilot knew where they were headed, which seems likely, it wasn't wise to start mentioning secret meetings on open comms. The common quarters would serve just fine for sleeping and stowage and the ship had plenty of room to keep from getting bored or feeling cramped, but he would have to find a more private area for morning meditations. Perhaps they wouldn't be aboard long after all.
*Goodbye Telia V, hello destiny…*

### **Alicia** (2012-05-25 14:34:42)

Tanith gives an irritated sigh at the mention of the haywired sensors. "**Can you believe they made me pay for the mess… Rental and installation fee ha. Took Drem and me almost two weeks to work through the mess 'nough to get the sensors even remotely working right.**" As he rants he expertly maneuvers the ship, banking the ship slightly to get a good angle for the break through the atmosphere. The console beeps indicating a transmission coming through the panel and Deagin can see it's coming from one of the consoles in the ship. For the moment Tanith is ignoring it. "**The others have gone their merry way, and I've gotten stuck doing transport duty. Lass, doesn't trust anyone else to fly this boat and what man can refuse a pretty face, huh?**"
Finally as the ship breaks through he takes notice of the internal transmission and playing it over opens up the channel. "***Tanith here, Nar Shaddaa is a six hour jump. Long enough to twiddle your thumbs but not to get too comfortable.***" he says before closing the line again. Though at this point Ooru can probably hear what's going on in the cockpit from his vantage in the barely spartan lounge. Tanith's attention turns to the sensors as a proximity alarm goes off. "**And there she is,**" he says and punching more buttons opens the coms to the stub fighter pulling up alongside. "***Nice and easy, lass. The starboard ring is ready for you.***"
"***Suvar***" Ka'ra says through the comm.

---

### **Duggs** (2012-05-25 20:48:42)

He leans back in his chair to try and get a little comfortable for the duration of this cruise. "**I do believe it is almost impossible to turn down a pretty face.**" He says with a smile. "**You shouldn't have anymore issues with your sensors. I got it all straightened up in there, and don't worry, I won't charge you this time.**" He lets out a small laugh as he finishes his sentence. "**I have met many pilots in my time working on ships, and I am glad that you are the one flying us. Hopefully we won't need your skills at keeping this bucket in the air while under fire.**" He sits there and stares out at space.
*I have always loved seeing the stars…*

---

### **Alicia** (2012-05-29 09:25:59)

It's not long before the stub fighter is docked and secured to the *Atin Oya'ka* and after checking a few things on his panel Tanith turns the ship toward the direction of their jump. Pulling on a lever the stars elongate as the hyperdrive kicks in and the ship effortlessly jumps to lightspeed. His work now done for the time being, the pilot takes a moment to check their course before standing and stretching. "**Time for a nap.**" He picks up his helmet before giving the Jawa mechanic a pat on his shoulder and exiting the cockpit. He stops just outside the cockpit door as he spots Ooru.
"**You must be my other passenger,**" he remarks drawing closer to extend his hand in greeting, though his grip is strong as he exchanges it. "**Tanith Hoagra.**" Standing at an average height, Tanith can't be more than 29 standard years. However, his dark hair is starting to grey at the temples, and his brown eyes seem haunted though there's a spark of something else. The armor he currently sports is patched, faded, and well worn as are his pistols.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-29 09:35:03)

"**Ooru Okin.**" replies Ooru, glad to meet the rest of the ship's voice. "**Good to meet you, Tanith. Enjoy your nap!**"
He lets Tanith pass without further conversation, knowing a well-rested pilot is the best kind. Ooru addresses Daegin in the cockpit through the open hatch:
"**So Daegin - ever been to Nar Shadaa? I've heard of it but never been myself.**"

---

### **Duggs** (2012-05-29 11:59:02)

When Tanith pats his shoulder he looks up at him and gives him a nod before he heads off to take his nap.
He looks back at Ooru. "**I have heard a lot of things about it from the pilots that would ask us to work on their ships, but I have never been there myself. I actually have only left Tattoine once and that was when Ka'ra brought me to Telia V.**"

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-31 10:44:03)

"**Ah. So that's your thing - you work on ships then? No offense - I hope you don't have a lot to do. I don't mind facing some smugglers or assassins as long as it's someplace with gravity and a natural atmosphere. I suppose if I had a profession though, it'd be something more of a healer. As it stands I'm just trying to help out and make sure no one else gets hurt too much.**"
Ooru recalls his conversation with Ka'ra in Lanius' quarters.
*She doesn't seem like that type to lead us into danger we couldn't handle, and I'm sure she can deal with quite a bit of trouble on her own anyway. I wonder how much Jut-Haak knows about her…*

---

### **Duggs** (2012-05-31 11:20:26)

"**None taken. I am a ship mechanic, and at the moment I am not busy. It has been a lot quieter for me since I left the Mos Eisley Spaceport. Sometimes it can be boring, but there are also times that I enjoy just having some time to myself.**" He brought his hands up and placed them behind his head as he leaned back in his seat.
"**A healer? So you use herbs and poultices and stuff?**"
"**Hopefully I won't be needing your skills anytime soon.**" He chuckled as he finished speaking.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I split up the comments because I didn't want it to seem as though I was laughing at Ooru for being a healer, just laughing at the simple comment he made.

</details>

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-02 06:59:44)

"**Poultrices?**" Ooru chuckles himself, "**Well not exactly, but you get the idea. And I certainly hope so - but between you and me, I can't imagine pulling through this with us *and* the ship all in our respective pieces. I've seen some of what we're up against and I know it's going to be tougher than Ka'ra lets on.**"
Ooru recalls the events of the last few months again, his mind only dwelling on recent weeks for a few moments. It's nice to have company other than Lanius this time.
*He's not quite rude I guess, just takes some time to get used to. Don't we all…*

"**I can't really say much about us coming back with all of our pieces, but I will do everything that I can to keep this bucket together and in the air. Since I imagine that we are not the best of fighters, I hope that this agent we are meeting is on our side, and a good fighter. Then again, if he isn't on our side, I hope he is terrible at fighting.**" He chuckles at that last comment. "**You have seen what we are up against? What exactly are we going up against?**"
*At least I hope I can keep this bucket in the air…*

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-03 12:16:39)

"**Well…**" Ooru ponders his response before answering Daegin, "**I don't know anything about this Qel-Droma character, or Yuri, but the Force Harvester is some sort of Force-based weapon. It's supposed to drain the life out of everything. I've never seen it but I know Lanius was working with Jut-Haak, the Master of our Brotherhood, to find it and I *think* one of them may have been really close. A research station near Telia V was destroyed in the ensuing encounter and Jut-Haak is now a disembodied spirit or some sort. *Very* dangerous even without the Force Harvester. What Lanius intends to do once he discovers it is anyone's guess but I think it's safe to say he's not going to use it. Another member of our Brotherhood, and a very close friend, was hurt by Jut-Haak last time we met, and before disappearing he promised we'd meet again.**"
He lets the words sink in, then summarizes: "**So we're headed to a the smuggler moon to meet with an unknown Hutt affiliate about information from a dead exile on where an ancient weapon might be located, and we have to get it before an angry ghost does or all life everywhere will be destroyed. That about sums it up. Welcome to the party, Daegin.**" He smiles sarcastically at his last comment and, despite the weight of all that's been said, still manages to feel hopeful about the odds. Heroes tend to come from unexpected places and this crew was shaping up to be quite an unorthodox mix already.

### **Duggs** (2012-06-04 12:32:22)

He sits there thinking about all that Ooru just said. "**Well…Doesn't this just sound like it is going to be a fun day in the office. I guess I shouldn't have complained about Telia V being so quiet.**" He laughs about what he said and then looks out at space.
*Life is about to get very interesting…*

### **Alicia** (2012-06-06 12:00:01)

The trip itself to Nar Shaddaa is uneventful. Upon boarding the ship, Ka'ra gives Ooru Daegin a wave before tiredly unlocking one of the forward crew quarters opposite of Tanith's and heading inside.
Some six hours later, a console beeps in the cockpit notifying the pilot and anyone else in the cockpit the ship is about to drop out of hyperspace. Tanith appears still in his motley armor and takes his position in the pilot's chair. Having dropped into the Y'Toub system some distance away from their destination, the pilot sets course for the third planet in its system. Drawing closer to Nal Hutta the communications panel comes to life as the METOSP is transmitted.<div style="text-align: right;">
![NarShaddaa-TOR.jpg](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100730194537/starwars/images/b/bb/NarShaddaa-TOR.jpg)
</div>

"**Yea, Yea,**" Tanith quips, turning off the sudden spew of information as it informs the crew to turn to a designated broadcasts for their destination. "**I know where I'm going.**" The viewscreen begins to fill with the sight of Nal Hutta's largest moon, Nar Shaddaa.

---

### **Duggs** (2012-06-06 12:59:26)

"**So that is Nar Shaddaa?**" He sits up in his chair and takes in the view as they approach. "**Do you need me to do anything Tanith? I do know a little bit about piloting, though it has never really been tested. Pilots always seemed to have a problem letting a Jawa fly their ship, even if it was just to move hangar bays.**"

---

### **Alicia** (2012-06-09 14:37:33)

Absently Tanith waves the Jawa away, easily maneuvering the *Atin Oya'ka* toward the moon. "**Nothing to it,**" he explains. "**But good to know you can help out in a pinch.**" After getting clearance from the port authority, he begins the descent into the moon's atmosphere.
Coming from behind, Ka'ra holds onto the back of the chairs. Devoid of her armor, she's changed into non-assuming tight pants and a halter top covered by a leather jacket. "**I've contacted Yuri already. He's going to meet us at the port.**"

---

### **Duggs** (2012-06-13 18:04:44)

He gives Tanith a nod as he pilots them to the moon.
After Ka'ra comes in he looks back and nods to her.

---

### **Alicia** (2012-06-14 18:38:22)

The landing is smooth, as one would expect from a professional pilot and it's not long before Tanith is in the process of going through the shut down procedure. "**I've got this, Squeaky. Deal was to mind the ship while you lot got to have the adventure this time round.**" Waving Daegin away he finishes his work. Ka'ra gives a small laugh and squeezes the pilot's shoulder affectionately before turning to leave, leading the way to the lower level and the ramp. As she walks she slings her heavy rifle over one shoulder, its presence seeming to reassure the young woman.
The docking bay is on the verge of being called shabby. Oil spills stain the ground, a testament to either the sort of ships which come through or to the care the facility's administration gives the bay.
((I'm not really particular to the description of the bay if you guys wish to play off of anything or make up your own. As I won't be able to post much this weekend feel free to have your own little side adventure and I'll get you guys back on track.))

---

### **Duggs** (2012-06-14 21:51:55)

He gives Tanith a nod and a smile as he gets up from the chair and starts his way to the lower level and the ramp. As he gets to the bottom of the ramp he takes a pause for a second. "**I would never let my work area get this dirty and to such ill repair. Someone should have taught these guys the importance of owning your workspace.**" He shakes his head as he steps off of the ramp and takes a look around the docking bay.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-15 06:39:10)

Ooru is content to pass the rest of the travel in relative peace, assured that it won't last long. Ka'ra's presence and a safe landing bode well for the immediate future however. The port is exactly what one would expect under the circumstances - which speaks volumes to their ability to blend in or concoct quick cover stories if the need arises. Ships - and parts of ships - lay in various stages of preparation and repair all around the area. Clearly the bay serves its purpose but not much more.
"**It's just as well, I guess. Clean and organized means less hiding places and cover - maybe that's the idea..?**"
Ooru takes the final step off the ramp behind Daegin and looks around, taking in the fullness of the sights, and smells, of the bay. His question is answered in stripes as his right foot splashes in some sort of fluid on the deck.
"**Of course this *is* a bit of overkill…**"
He adjust the shoulder strap on his pack and waits for Ka'ra to lead the way.

Maybe DA's first post should be to find us? He spots us and then approaches - that way we're not holding him off any longer and the three of us can RP?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-15 14:26:02)

**"We are in Hutt space now, what were you expecting? A vacation resort?"**
The voice comes from one of he sides of the bay, and from the shadows between some of the various ships stationed there a robed figure approaches the landing ramp. As he get closer he pulls back the hood of his cloak, revealing the face of a young human male in his mid-twenties. As the cloak flows with his movement, a side holster with a blaster in it is revealed, and the quick of eye can also catch the glimpse of a knife hilt located at his lower back.
**"Welcome, milady and gentlemen, to the Smuggler´s Moon. Yuri Carkov, at your service. Former…a lot of things really, but recently I have been working with Ka'ra and Lanius on their little projects"**
He turns quickly to Ka'ra, and offers her a small nod of his head.
**"Everything is set and ready for the meeting. Our man will be at a local casino - the Corusca Gem - in a few hours. The neighborhood is kind of rough, so you might want to consider strapping on those handy plates of yours"**
Turning back to the two new additions to the troupe, he eyed them both carefully, not really considering them the kind of crowd that he would have brought to Nar Shadaa. But then, he trusted Ka'ra´s judgment in these things. After all, they had been quite the ragtag group that went after the Force Harvester, and that had worked out.
**"So, you are the newcomers, eh? In case you haven´t been here before, let me tell you the only rule of value on this moon. It´s the law of th jungle, and not paying attention to it can get you killed. Quickly. Now then, do you have any questions, or would you like me to show you the local sights?"**
A smile crept into his face at the last comment.

---

### **Alicia** (2012-06-15 15:12:19)

Ka'ra offers Yuri an easy smile and nods to him in turn. "**Good work, though unless we want a fight it would be best if I'm not seen in my armor right now.**" She eyes him as she makes his introductions and his wayward form of warning. "**One would think you've been enjoying your assignment here,**" she comments with a raised eyebrow.
Shifting her attention to them all, she adds, "**I have some things to take care of. I'll meet you at the casino for the meeting. Yuri, you have my channel?**" she asks rhetorically, before giving them a farewell salute and starts heading toward the docking bay's exit with the confidence of someone who's been here before.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-15 18:09:35)

The young man chuckled a bit when the mention of him liking his assignment came up.
**"Well, I suppose there are worse places to be sent to. The sphere of toxic gas this moon orbits for example. Plus, this place is one of the best in the Galaxy if you want to learn precious tidbits of information, so I guess it does have its upsides"**

---

### **Duggs** (2012-06-16 08:42:04)

"**I didn't expect any sort of vacation resort, I just expected workers to take some form of ownership for their stuff.**" He says and then looks around at the docking bay again, with a slight look of disgust on his face. "**So we will be meeting our contact in a Casino? I think I can use a drink after seeing this place.**"
He looks up at Yuri and slightly shakes his head as though he had forgotten something, and then he extends his hand for a handshake. "**By the way, my name is Daegin.**

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-17 06:58:28)

Ooru nods a farewell to Ka'ra and addresses Yuri:
"**And I'm Ooru Okin, though you probably already knew that - if you're as connected as you boast. I can't say I'm that interested in "the sights" but we're sort of at your mercy for the moment.**"
He sizes up the agent in a glance or two and then waits for the next move.
*I've seen worse, but not a lot worse. Ka'ra going of on her own is somewhat unexpected but perhaps she's better known - and more easily recognized - around these parts.*

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-17 11:24:42)

Yuri takes the Jawas hand and shakes it.
**"Nice to meet you Daegin. Kind of unusual to see a Jawa away from Tatooine, but if there´s one place to do it, Nar Shadaa would be it"**
He turns to look at the second newcomer Ka'ra had brought with her.
**"Nah, I don´t bother checking up the people Ka'ra sets me up to work with. I trust her, though she have a knack for finding some really odd characters"**
He chuckled at the thought of some of the characters the Mandalorian woman had set him up with in the past.
**"But I guess you´ve already met Tanith. If you don´t mind me asking though, where are you from? I´ve been around a bit, but I can´t really place you"**

### **Duggs** (2012-06-17 15:07:38)

"**There was nothing left for me on Tatooine, so I gladly accepted when Ka'ra offered me a job with her.**"

*Seems like an odd place for casual chit-chat but these are unusual circumstances…*
"**I'm originally from Alpheridies. Don't let the eyes fool you - I'm Miralukan. I joined up with Jut-Haak's Brotherhood a while back and met Lanius, then Ka'ra, as things have begun to…**" he ponders the next word, "**unfold. Mostly I've hung around to make sure more people don't end up hurt, but saving the galaxy's a good motivation too.**"
Ooru suddenly thinks to ask if Yuri knew anything about Acheron Base but decides now might not be the time. Perhaps a less exposed setting would be better.
"**I'm not sure how much time we have but a drink might actually be just the thing at the moment. I'm curious about a couple points and I think if we all compare notes it might help.**"

Yuri listened as both of them gave some more information on themselves. His opinion that they both seemed quite out of place on the Smugger´s Moon didn´t change, but neither did his trust that Ka'ra had had a good reason to bring them along. And after all, at this point they weren´t really expecting things to get rough, they were just looking for information.
**"We have a few hours to our meeting, but if you are both that thirsty, I guess it couldn´t hurt to get going early. The thing about the sights were mainly bantha dung - this is about as good as it gets in this sector"**
Waving his hand for them to follow him, he started a slow walk towards the exit of the landing area.
**"If you have any questions, ask, and I´ll see if I can answer them for you"**

---

### **Duggs** (2012-06-20 08:11:24)

He gives Yuri a nod as he waves them on and then follows behind him, at a pace to just keep up with him. As he walks he is looking around and taking in some of the "sights" that are around, since he has only really seen Tatooine and Telia V.

Ooru, too, keeps his eye roaming the darker corners of the facility, alert for any danger as much as for unintended listeners.
"**Tell us Yuri - what's your read on Ka'ra? She seems genuine enough, and Lanius looks to have everyone's best interest at heart - what's your experience with them been? A lot of action? Low-level stuff? What about Master Jut-Haak?**"
*Hmm… maybe he doesn't know that one…*
The questions come easily though, having been rolling around in Ooru's mind for sometime. Ka'ra's judgement is beyond question, as Yuri stated, and he's certainly above suspicion himself, but the Miralukan suspects a larger story is being woven here than even he expected...

Heading out of the bay and into mid-level Nar Shaddaa, the state of the hanger bay seems to be the status quo for the rest of the district. It's actually not a long walk to their destination, the location of the bay seems to be purposefully chosen in the event a quick departure from the meeting was needed.
The noise and industrial stink of mid-level Nar Shaddaa mingles with the shouting of the barkers and the down-and-out reek of desperate gamblers at the glaringly lit entrance to the Corusca Gem Casino. Burly bouncers—hissing Barabels, grunting Gamorreans, and one massive Herglic—glare at everyone, coming or going, as though just looking for an excuse.
Just inside the doors of the Corusca Gem Casino, the noise hits like a concussion grenade. As far as the eye can see, gamblers of myriad species mill around hundreds of gaming machines and tables, throwing away their credits. Dozens of waitresses circulate through the crowd, carrying trays of drinks and snacks. The whole place is dimly illuminated, with little pools of light here and there. But the noise is nearly deafening: gaming machines ringing, beeping, and clattering; gamblers howling, hooting, and shouting; and almost hidden underneath it all, clashing, raucous music that some species probably finds soothing.

**"Aye, she´s alright, maybe a little rough around the edges sometimes. But she and Lanuis are really bent on keeping everyone safe from the Brotherhood, and I trust them enough to stick around and lend a hand. Apart from that whole thing that got us the Harvester in the first place, I´ve mainly been doing odd jobs for them, and was most recently dispatched here to see if I couldn´t draw out some more information on the matter"**
Reaching their destination, Yuri walks past the bouncers without hesitation, meeting the gaze of anyone trying to intimidate him with steady eyes and a cocky smile. Well inside, he starts to look for a suitable table.
**"As for Jut-Hakk, I´ve only seen him very fleetingly once, when we were taking off with the Harvester. Powerful Force user from what I can tell, but Lanius seemed to have him under control"**
After finding a good place, he takes a seat, adjusting the knife sheath in his lower back, and making sure the blade slid easily.

### **Duggs** (2012-06-20 21:35:18)

He walks up and hops onto a seat at the table.
"**So the Brotherhood is bad, the Force Harvester is bad and we are supposed to be the good guys and save everyone? That is if I have gotten this all right so far.**"
He works on flagging down one of the bartenders.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-21 00:24:56)

Smiling as the Jawa gave the brief recap of their situation, Yuri reached out casually in the Force, probing their surroundings. He was well aware that Ooru was capable in the Force - all Miraluka were - and didn´t pay him much heed in this matter. It was the presence of other beings trained in the Force he was on the lookout for, especially those trained to use its darker sides. It had been a while since his last run-in with Sith assassins, not since before he hooked up with Ka'ra and Lanius, so perhaps they had finally lost his trail. Still, old habits die hard, and he decided to be a little extra cautious since there was more than his personal security at stake here should they be interrupted.

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-21 06:50:53)

"**Hmm. That's almost right.**" replies Ooru, after hearing Daegin's recap. "**I wouldn't go so far as to say the entire Brotherhood is bad. I still count myself among its members for one, and it's most often individuals that go astray, not whole communities. The discovery of the Force Harvester by Master Jut-Hakk must have been quite tempting. If I understand correctly, it's actually only a part of a bigger device from a long time ago.**"
He pauses to order a drink for himself as well, an apparently local specialty - *Gamblers' Regret*. Whether the regret was to drink it or not interested Ooru, in the spirit of their surroundings.
"**Somehow the station above Telia V, Acheron Base, was sabotaged or malfunctioned - maybe Yuri can fill in some blanks there - and I arrived on the planet looking for Master Davian, a good friend and brother of Master Tonin who sent me. Lanius and I eventually found him badly wounded in a derelict craft where we encountered the phantom Jut-Hakk. Davian's still recovering and I maintain hope that our Master may yet see reason. People do change…**"
Ooru takes his first sip and discovers, with surprise, that the regret would have been to not order the drink. A *Gamblers' Regret* is a mixture of many flavors and, if he had to guess, never tastes the same twice - based on the advert for it on the vidscreen behind the bar and some of the faces of others seated elsewhere, sipping their own glasses.
"**But not everyone knows all that,**" he adds, "**In fact - I'm not even sure *I've* got it all straight just yet. Ka'ra and Lanius do seem to be about saving everyone though, and we're here to help.**"

### **Duggs** (2012-06-21 07:59:38)

He orders a drink that sits atop his favorites, the *Sonic Servodriver*.
"**Ok. Not the whole Brotherhood, just a few bad eggs. I think I am starting to get some of this straight. What are we going to do when we find this Force Harvester? Are we going to disassemble it, or destroy it? Did you say that Jut-Hakk is a phantom, like a ghost or something?**"
He takes a sip of his drink and a smile pops up on his face. "**It has been a while since I have had a good one of these.**"

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-21 08:14:30)

"**I'm not really sure what we're going to *do* with it - just keep anyone *else* from doing anything with it. And when Lanius and I saw Jut-Hakk he was in some sort of phantom form. Whether it's permanent or a sort of Force projection I'm not sure - but he's dangerous nonetheless.**"
*Maybe there's more to this drink than I thought… this might not be the safest place to be talking about these things so openly…*

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-21 12:33:54)

As drinks are ordered, Yuri just calls for "anything Corellian". Having tried the quality of drinks in this place already, he figures that the stronger the beverage, the less likely it is to be screwed up. Or at least, the less likely he´ll be to notice. Taking a sip from the glass and noticing that he was only partially right, he grimaces slightly and puts it down.
**"Just to get one thing straight gentlemen, we are in fact already in possession of the Harvester. Trust me, I know. The reason we are all here is because we have found some leads that might help us dispose of it once and for all. You know, without the Galaxy imploding on itself, or whatever usually happens when you tries to destroy dark side artifacts without knowing how. Didn´t Ka'ra tell you why we´re here?"**
He pauses to take another sip of his drink, and noticed it did start to taste better, as do most strong beverages.
**"As for that whole business on Acheron, we needed a diversion to get away, so we rigged a few crates to blow. Worked pretty well"**

---

### **Duggs** (2012-06-21 21:45:55)

He takes a sip of his drink and then leans back a little in his seat. "**I can't say that I knew exactly what was going on, or that I even asked. Ka'ra said she needed my help and I said that I would help. I thought I was being brought in because I am small, and I am a decent mechanic. Maybe I have a bigger role in all of this, and maybe I am just here to fix shit as it breaks. I am just glad that I am no longer on Tatooine.**"

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-22 20:41:54)

Ooru pauses in mid-sip as Yuri mentions already being in possession of the Force Harvester.
*Did I completely miss that?*
"**I'm sorry,**" he lowers his voice a bit and leans in, "**I must have misunderstood something - we are *right now* in possession of the Force Harvester?**"
Brief memories from the past, shrouded in darkness and malevolence flicker, through Ooru's mind almost too quickly to be recognized before giving way once more to curiosity. The simple image of a glyph he found on Alpheridies and the ghostly visage of Jut-Hakk.
*Now that's enough of that*, he tells himself.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, so I'm wicked sorry if I missed your hints Alicia, perhaps it's just best to keep on this path. I can pick up the pieces easily enough.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-22 22:51:34)

Finishing off his drink in one fell swoop, Yuri grimaces again. He would not be having another one of those.
**"Unless someone has misplaced the damn thing in the time I´ve been here, then we should still have it. And I´m pretty sure I would have been informed if we had lost it"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-23 21:50:16)

Ooru simply nods in acknowledgement of Yuri's reply, still somewhat shocked about the situation. Whether it had been kept from him intentionally or he had just plain missed it, this changed things considerably. Jut-Hakk, if he ever found out - or perhaps he knew already? - would do his best to make this difficult.
*I'd like to say the hard parts over but Yuri's right - we can't just throw something like that into a sun and be done with it. Things are never easy with the Dark Side…*
That's something Ooru has learned the hard way.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I think that pretty much covers anything I missed and brings Ooru back up to speed. Sorry, again, for not catching on quicker.

</details>

---

### **Duggs** (2012-06-24 01:50:57)

He ponders what is being said for a few seconds. "**So… We can't just tear the damned thing apart and reverse engineer it to make something that would be useful to us?**"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-24 02:54:42)

Smiling at Daegins proposal, Yuri shook his head. Jawas were known to be keen on technology, and he guessed that was the reason Daegin was here, and he obviously felt confident in his skills.
**"Sure, take it up with Ka'ra or Lanius. Don´t get your hopes up though. We´re talking ancient and exotic Dark Side technology here, and I´m guessing trying to take it apart the wrong way could be just as bad as trying to dispose of it without enough knowledge"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-24 03:02:48)

"**And don't forget,**" adds Ooru, "**When you're talking about Dark Side artifacts - you have to resist the urge to even *remember* too much. If you're here to help disassemble the Force Harvester Daegin, you should be careful about studying it too closely. That's not an insult, simply a suggestion from someone with experience.**"
The conversation has left Ooru with some new insights as to Lanius' abilities to withstand Jut-Hakk. Did he have it as far back as when the two were on the derelict craft?
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I'm cool with this conversation, but ready to move on if ya'll are. Ooru and I are both reeling at this news. ![8/](https://i.ibb.co/kVxpy8vX/icon-eek.gif)

### **Alicia** (2012-06-25 14:23:24)

Having made your way to the back bar where Nak Simm has been scheduled to meet you, you pass the next couple hours between yourselves with little interruption by the other patrons. The bar at the back of the casino is a cozier affair: three bartenders, half a dozen waitresses, and a few isolated, intimate tables. The people back here don’t want to be seen; they’re here to do business. There’s not a bouncer in sight, but the bartenders look more than capable of handling any minor disturbances. For that matter, so do the waitresses.
Eventually, near the scheduled rendezvous with Torga’s representative Ka’ra appears in relatively good spirits though there’s a hole in her jacket that you’re sure wasn’t there before. She takes a seat at the table calling for another round of drinks. Casting a brief look around artfully not meeting any of the other patrons’ gazes, she asks in a low voice, “**No sign of our contact?**“

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-26 08:21:04)

Acknowledging the Mandalorian womans arrival with a slight raise of his hand, Yuri leans back in his chair. He was a bit curious about where she had been, but he knew better than to ask about it. If she wanted him to know, she´d tell him. Taking a quick look around to make sure he hadn´t missed anything, he shook his head.
**"Not yet, but he´s got some time left. In the meantime, I hope you don´t mind that I brought these two up to speed regarding our mission. You left them clueless enough that I felt sorry for them"**

---

### **Duggs** (2012-06-26 11:20:47)

"**The way that I figure it is that if I am kept in the dark it is probably for a reason. I don't need to know every bit of what is going on. I just need to know what to tear apart, or fix.**" He sits there for a second and then points at the hole in Ka'ra's jacket. "**Is that new?**"

---

### **Alicia** (2012-06-26 18:18:32)

"**A bit late now to mind, isn't it,**" Ka'ra remarks sipping the grim looking ale the waitress brings over. "**Though I shouldn't have to warn you of what to say where.**" Not particularly upset on the matter she leaves it be and glances down in disdain at the hole as Daegin points it out. "**Blast. Ended up being closer than I thought,**" she frowns at the hole, fingering it for a moment. Looks as though someone tried to take a stab at her, quite literally.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-06-26 20:35:52)

A mixture of embarrassment, curiosity, and foreboding washes over Ooru after Ka'ra arrives. The hole in her jacket is probably a testament to how rough things can get around here, and Ka'ra's well-being is a testament to how rough she can get back. He acknowledges her arrival with a nod and smile but says nothing, content to listen to whatever more needs to be said.
*She's right about saying too much out in the open, but at least we aren't on the tarmac…*

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-26 20:37:40)

Smiling, Yuri thought that yeah, he could keep his mouth in check. With some effort.
**"Better late then never I suppose"**
As Daegin pointed it out, he noted the hole on Ka'ra´s clothing. Whoever did that, they had been close indeed.
**"And you said we weren´t looking for fights. Anyone in particular I should add to my watchlist?"**
Instinctively, while listening for an answer, he swept the surroundings carefully, both with his eyes and with the Force.
((
So I´ll be looking for our contact, or anyone eying us or something similarly suspicious, including anyone Ka'ra describes. And I would like the result of my Sense Force check from before, in case you missed it among all the posts.

### **Duggs** (2012-06-27 08:01:00)

He looks around for a second and then takes a drink as Yuri talks. He looks back at Ka'ra as he thinks about the hole in her jacket. "**At least it was only close and not on target.**"

---

### **Alicia** (2012-06-27 23:38:19)

With a shake of her head Ka'ra and a shrug dismisses the issue. "**Just some unfinished business. Shouldn't be a problem, but let me know if you see a Human with a Togorian coming this way.**" She takes a drink of her ale, and then frowns at it. Swirling the dark ale around she glances at a chrono and then up at Yuri. "**Wasn't this Nak Simm supposed to be here by now?**"
Indeed a quick glance puts Torga's envoy at being nearly twenty minutes late.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-30 04:15:48)

Leaning back in his seat again, Yuri nods.
**"Yeah, or rather 20 minutes ago. I´ll go have a look"**
Starting to think of possible reasons why the Zabrak hadn´t shown up yet (except for the obvious ones), Yuri slowly makes his way out into the main area of the casino, discreetly looking around for Nak Simm as he made his way towards the exit to take a look outside.

---

### **Alicia** (2012-07-28 10:37:40)

Moving out into the casino proper, Yuri sees a myriad of Zabraks but none seeming to find more interest than in their choice of game. Outside the massive Herglic eyes him distrustfully for a moment before doing the same to another departing patron, while the other bouncers continue in their universal glares of anyone coming to and fro.
While Yuri is off checking out the casino, Ka'ra continues to nonchalantly drink the dark liquid brought to her. "**If things get rough, be ready to get under the table.**"

---

### **Duggs** (2012-07-28 14:05:52)

"**I am practically already there.**" He laughs at his own joke at how small he is and then he takes another drink.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-07-29 04:28:52)

Not really feeling a good vibe about the whole situation, Yuri remains outside for a few more moments to see if anything interesting is going on before returning back inside. He was experienced enough to know that things sometimes don´t go according to plan, but as the old saying goes "no plan survives contact with the enemy". And he had hoped that this particular plan would go without an enemy, or at least that it would be one that he could recognize.
Returning back to his companions, he sat down and shook his head.
**"I´d be willing to wait a few more minutes just in case he has been delayed. In any way though, I think it´s safe to assume that something has interfered with our plans, and that this whole thing won´t go as smooth as one could have hoped"**

---

### **Alicia** (2012-07-30 15:47:14)

Ka'ra smirks at Daegin's joke and then turns her attention back to Yuri as he returns. Nodding she agrees with his assessment. "**Try getting Torga on the comms. Maybe something has happened on his end.**"
Using the same comm frequency to contact Torga the first time, the first attempt goes unanswered. The second attempt results in someone other than Torga answering, and by the accent it could be guessed he's Arkanian. "**The esteemed Torga does not appreciate any interruptions while he is in conference. This better be good.**"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-07-30 20:04:03)

Leaning back in his chair, Yuri kept scanning the surrounding area casually while talking. Despite his slight annoyance at the responders tone, he kept his voice calm and friendly.
**"I´m not sure if I´d call it good, but I just felt like reporting in that one of your masters representatives have failed to appear at an arranged meeting. From where I´m standing, this can be due to three different reasons. Either something has befallen him, or he has decided to deliberately sabotage your masters dealings, or it could be that Torga himself has given him new orders without my knowing"**
Taking a momentary pause, he adopted a slightly more serious tone, but still friendly and non-threatening.
**"In the two former cases, I´m sure the esteemed Torga would appreciate being informed, and if it is the latter, then *I* would very much like being informed on any new dealings"**

### **Alicia** (2012-08-02 14:45:25)

There's a long pause and finally the voice comes back with "**Nak Simm contacted me some time ago indicating he was delayed, but he should have been there by now. I'll look into it. Don't call again**." The line is promptly disconnected.
Having listened to the exchange, Ka'ra's eyebrow in a question. "**Typical. If we didn't have another way to get the information…**" She shakes her leaving the thought unfinished.

---

### **Duggs** (2012-08-02 16:07:50)

"**Well… At least I have time for another drink.**" He flags one of the bartenders for another drink.

---

### **Alicia** (2012-08-15 15:32:04)

Ka'ra nods in agreement though she takes to swirling the contents of her current round about in its glass. "**Other than time we have nothing to lose in waiting a bit longer,**" she says thoughtfully. "**Then we'll have to see if we can get what we need without Torga."**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-08-22 18:26:44)

His mind lost in thoughts of his own, Yuri leaned back in his chair staring out into the wider area of the small section of the casino they were in as his companions spoke. He pondered the implications of what they had just been told. Nak Simm had reported in that he was expecting a delay, and it had sounded like Torga´s representative had expected the Zabrak to have made the meeting by now. Just like he had said on the comm, three possible scenarios had formed in his mind, and even though the third one had become less likely, he still could not rule it out. Thinking one step ahead, he tried to anticipate what each scenario could mean.
If something had befallen the Zabrak, he couldn´t really draw that many conclusions. Just as well as it could mean that they had indeed been on to something, it could also mean that Nak Simm had suffered one of the hundreds of "accidents" that happened on Nar Shadaa daily. If Torga had decided to give the Zabrak new orders without informing them, then it would seem like the meeting could very well turn into a trap. While he could probably come up with some other reasons that Torga would cross them, he could not shake the biting sensation that he had been betrayed by Zarim, and that the Hutt would try to collect on one of the bounties for Jedi that were flying around. So far, he had never had any reason to doubt that Zarim could keep his secret, but then he never had had any reason to actually trust the Toydarian either.
Worst, though, he felt would be if Nak Simm was operating without Torga´s knowledge as well. That would likely mean that someone else was interested in them, and he didn´t like the prospect of another player in this game, especially one they didn´t know and that was likely hostile. Then again, he figured while rubbing his temple, maybe he was over-thinking this whole thing. He absently responding to Ka'ra with a small nod.
**"Tell me when you´re done waiting, and I´ll see what I can do"**

---

### **Alicia** (2012-09-05 14:45:58)

Ka'ra takes a look around and then with a sigh begins to stand up, a sure sign that the time had come. Abruptly, a dark-skinned Zabrak wearing a loose-fitting robe hurries toward the group, with a small number of bodyguards in tow. “**My apologies for keeping you waiting,**” he says. “**I was unavoidably delayed. I am Torga’s representative, Nak Simm. Shall we be seated?**” He indicates the chair Ka'ra was just rising from and with a glance over at her comrades she resumes her seat. Before taking his seat he turns to his entourage and waves them off toward the gaming machines.
With a wave of his hand he motions for the waitress to bring a fresh round of drinks for the occupants of the table including himself - his choice undoubtedly for one with an exceptional constitution. "**Now then,**" he starts, adjusting himself in the chair. "**What business do you have with Torga.**"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-09-09 12:19:21)

Watching the Zabrak finally arrive, Yuri leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes briefly, rubbing his temple. He had expected the Zabrak to show up alone, and his arriving late and accompanied by guards didn´t sit to well with the former Jedi. He had learned to always be on his guard, a skill that had kept him alive during the recent hectic periods in his life.
Opening his eyes, he wondered if Ka'ra would take the reins or if she expected him to do the talking. Turning to the Zabrak, he shot a meaning glance towards the direction he had waved his guards.
**"I know Nar Shadaa isn´t a walk in the park, but is there anything we should know of?"**

---

### **Duggs** (2012-10-20 04:05:33)

He watches the guards as they walk over towards the gaming machines. "**Are the bodyguards necessary?**" He seems to watch them a moment longer before taking another drink from his glass.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-02-27 15:15:51)

The Zabrak finds the table’s occupants unease amusing. “**Not a walk in the park indeed. One can never be too careful,**” he responds on the subject of the guards. Nearly finishing his drink in one swig when the waitress deposits it in front of him “**Now then, my time is short.**” He looks between the tables occupants, his gaze falling lecherously on Ka’ra.
Ignoring the Zabrak, Ka’ra for her part remains relaxed and is keeping a careful eye on the crowd where the guards have disappeared; a sign she’s leaving the dealings to Yuri and Daegin.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-06 17:38:39)

Raising his hand in a "hey, don´t blame me" motion, Yuri smiles friendly at the Zabrak.
**"Maybe you should have gotten here sooner then. But now that you are here, we should get down to business. I´m pretty sure you know the reason for this meeting, so let´s skip right over that. We believe that Torga has some information that we need, and so we´d like to meet with your esteemed master to see if he does. And if that is the case, to see if he can´t be persuaded to release it to us"**

He looks between the group as Yuri talks to the Zabrak. Occasionally he takes a swig from his drink.
*Hopefully this deal can go smoothly.*
He reached up and removed his personal translator for a second. He could be seen adjusting the strap on it and rubbing his neck before he put it back on.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-03-06 23:30:30)

While the Zabrak seems very interested in the table’s female occupant he reluctantly turns his gaze to Yuri and the business at hand. As Yuri speaks the Zabrak’s focus, attentive at first, begins to wander about the room after a few moments. When Yuri stops speaking, he looks back as if just noticing them. “**I’m sorry,**” his apology less than convincing. “**I find myself distracted. Explain again why it is you want to meet the esteemed Torga?**”
Just when Yuri is about to speak he interrupts, “**Have you ever done business with a Hutt before? Jabba, maybe? Or perhaps Motta, Arok, Ziro, maybe even Moska?**” his list seems to be going on in a wide variety of names, some of them you might have heard of.
Again not waiting for an answer he turns to Daegin. "It's quite unusual to see your kind away from the desert of Tattooine."

---

### **Duggs** (2013-03-07 17:03:36)

He sits back some as he watches this Zabrak speak circles. He takes a drink as he ponders what to say next.
*He should know why we want to see Torga. Something feels wrong about how he is acting.*
He casually takes a few glances around them, and then he answers the Zabrak.
"**The desert had nothing left for me.**"

Content to have enjoyed his drink in silence, Ooru sizes up the Zabrak before addressing him:
"**I'd say we've about as much experience doing business with the Hutts as you do with folks like… *us*,**" he responds, with an obvious glance in the direction of the now not-so-close-at-hand bodyguards, "**Maybe a little more…**"
Ooru sets his drink down casually on the table and leans back in the booth. "**We understand it's customary to establish any brokerage fees for information in situations like this - just like it's bad form to keep either party waiting…**" He pauses for effect, letting the insinuation be clear. "**…but I'm afraid your time may indeed be too short to discuss that now though and, as my friend has pointed out, it's your *esteemed* master who we're here to see, not you. I'm sure an appropriately generous sum can be reached for the location of his whereabouts - should it prove correct.**"

To see if that helps grease his wheels. I'd make an actual offer but he *was* late and his guards *are* away at the moment, which should put him in a somewhat awkward position, once it's pointed out to him, and help him be a little more willing to work with us.
Or we can shoot him and pay for the mess like Han did - *like a **boss***. ![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)

The Zabrak gives Daegin a smirk, his next thought interrupted by the previously quiet Miralukan. He takes what seems like a long moment to size up the new speaker. Seemingly unconcerned by the fact his guards are out of sight, he swirls the content around in his glass in what looks like careful deliberation. “**The esteemed Torga has left it up to me to determine whether this deal will be worth his time.**” Finishing off his drink with a gulp, he sets it down with finality. “**Torga is aware of the bit of information you want. 50,000 credits is Torga’s price.**” Looking between the table’s occupants, he adds, “**Take it or leave it.**”
The number brings Ka’ra’s attention back to the dealings, and she lets out a hiss of disbelief. For her part she keeps her mouth shut, but she’s drawn the attention of the Zabrak for the moment.

Yuri looked on quietly as Ooru put some new thoughts into the head of the Zabrak, and he almost laughed a bit as Nak Simm gave them the number Torga was apparently demanding to give them the information they wanted. He wasn´t surprised one bit, though he was a little surprised that Ka'ra seemed to be. What had she expected when dealing with a Hutt? Most likely though, the high price was an opening to allow the Hutt to offer them a deal where they would perform him some kind of favor rather than paying. Which in Yuris experience could be far more costly than credits. Still, he thought, the Zabrak had just screwed up.
Leaning forward, he looked closely at the Zabrak, with more intensity than before, and most of the friendliness gone.
**"That´s a pretty hefty sum, friend. Especially since we´ll be saving your boss some money by taking you off his payroll. I mean, now that you´ve told us what he wants in exchange for the information, I think all we need to do is announce we are willing to pay, and we´ll still get our audience. Which means that you have just become sadly insignificant to the dealings at hand…or do you want to bet that a *Hutt* would be upset enough that he lost a lowlife like you to pass up fifty grand?"**
Turning his head to look at Ka'ra, he shot her a meaning look. He was no murderer, but he hoped that he could rattle the Zabrak enough to put Ka'ra in a slightly better bargaining position should she decide to weigh in here.
**"Should I take him outside to avoid making a mess?"**
((
I just noticed the rules don´t allow me to make a new Persuasion check myself (since my last one was an obvious failure), so I thought I´d do my best to assist anyone who wants to make another one, though it seemed like Ka'ra might be on her way to get in on the discussion.
I want to use my Commanding Presence talent to give our Zabrak friend a -2 penalty to his Will defense for the encounter, and use an Aid Another check for anyone making a Persuasion check. If someone else than Ka'ra does, I can edit my post to benefit that person instead.

He can be seen looking into the crowd, in the direction of the Zabrak's goons. He squints his eyes some as if trying to focus in on something. He thin taps one of his fingers on the table and points in the direction of the commotion that he spotted. "**Were you expecting company that you neglected to inform us of?**"
He looks back at the Zabrak as he reaches down with his other hand and unclips his holster as a precaution to what could be coming.
*Why couldn't this deal just go smoothly?*

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-12 23:23:53)

Giving the Zabrak a cold look of his own, Ooru answers Yuri's question: "**Oh, I don't know that I'd worry too much about the mess - it might make those guards start talking…**"
A sudden smile comes over his face however, as he makes a small gesture with his open hand and says: "**…but if it's totally non-negotiable I suppose we'll have to pay. If you'll just lead the way back, we'll follow you to Torga…?**"

### **Alicia** (2013-03-13 21:01:08)

The Zabrak seems completely unconcerned by Yuri and Ooru’s threats, apparently feeling very secure. After all, it was by Torga’s own command that Nak Simm is here to evaluate you. At Ooru’s Force suggestion, he only says “**All in good time.**”
Little more is said as there’s a clattering crash as an angry-looking, white eyed humanoid pushes past a waitress causing her to spill a tray of drinks. The humanoid, an Arkanian, accompanied by eight thugs strides right up to your table.
Slamming his fists onto your table, he rages with a vengeful fury, “**Well, you got your wish. You’ll get to see Torga, all right. But you’re going to wish you hadn’t. Get up. We’re leaving.**”

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-14 15:15:43)

*This is one confident Zabrak…he has obviously been doing this for a while*
Yuri was a bit impressed by Nak Simms confidence, and relaxed back into his seat. He hadn´t talked about it with Ka'ra, but he had a feeling that paying that amount of money wasn´t really something they´d consider. So they would just have to continue playing this little game with their new friend and see how things developed.
Shifting his attention as a loud noise catches it, he notices a rather angry-looking Arkanian making his way towards them, flanked by what Yuri guessed was not a friendly group of companions. He waited until the white-skinned fellow had finished his rant, and the satisfied smile crept back into his face. Perhaps all it had taken was for them to stall things with the Zabrak for a while, and another one of Torgas associates would lose patience.
Making no motion to get up, he looked at the Arkanian and widened his smile a little.
**"I´m sorry, and you are?"**

---

### **Duggs** (2013-03-14 21:42:37)

He downs the rest of his drink as the Arkanian walks up to the table. While he has his glass up he switches off his translator. He looks around, as Yuri asked who the Arkanian was, fr an escape route.
*I am not sure how well we will hold up being outnumbered like this.*
He pauses waiting to see how this will all play out.

---

### **BWS2K** (2013-03-14 23:04:57)

*How many people are we going to have to manage here…?*
Ooru let's out a small sigh, content to let Yuri's question be answered before adding any more to the conversation. He, too, makes no motion to get up just yet - but he does take the last sip of *Gambler's Regret*.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Hmm. I suppose we could just kill them all and see how bad Torga wants his money? No answer isn't a "*no, we won't pay*" answer...

### **Alicia** (2013-03-19 23:14:02)

The Arkanian doesn’t seem to take kindly to Yuri’s attitude as the furrow of his brow creases even more. Around him, his thugs begin to spread out to better support the Arkanian. While not overtly threatening at the moment, they do have their weapons in hands reach should the table’s occupants cause any trouble.
“**You can’t hide your tracks from a tracker. I just found Nak’s body where you dumped it in that alley,**” the Arkanian points toward the front of the casino for emphasis.
Anyone turning to the Zabrak for clarification elicits only a confused shrug from the sentient who had introduced himself as Nak Simm. Yuri and Daegin do notice that during the exchange the Zabrak has started to carefully move his hands to the edge of the table.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-20 07:37:07)

**"Really? Because if that´s the case, we have quite the interesting situation here"**
Shifting his head and gaze towards the Zabrak sitting at their table, Yuri shot him a look that indicated that making a run for it, drawing a weapon, or anything similar - anything at all in fact - would be a bad idea. Keeping one hand up on the table, he turned back to the Arkanian.
**"I´ve been hiding my tracks from worse things than you for quite some time now. But like I said, we have an interesting situation on our hands here, and I believe I´ve got some information that you - and Torga - might want to hear"**
((
I´ll ready an action to use Move Object on the Zabrak if he tries anything. Not to do damage or anything, but simply to keep him in place.
))

### **Duggs** (2013-03-20 14:45:56)

He looks up at the Arkanian as he walks up and says his piece.
"**Well isn't this quite interesting.**" He speaks only in Jawaese, since his translator is still turned off.
He moves his hand down and places it on his ion pistol getting ready for anything that could happen next.
((He gets ready to do a quick draw if it is needed.))

Kal breaks away from the Arkanian’s group to circle around their target’s table. En route, he activates his camouflage cloak and stealth field generator, doing so while he’s still behind the Arkanian's other enforcers. For a moment, his world shimmered as the energy field enshrouds his person.
Kal silently positions himself at the south western corner of the bar to provide him a greater vantage point of their target. He deploys his arm mounted rifle which causes a crosshair indicating bearing and distance to appear in his helmet’s HUD, moving where his weapon is pointed.
Kal trains his weapon towards the Zabrak ready to fire with one false move.

Kal goes to J3 assuming that he would have a clear shot on the Zabrak from there. Otherwise, I'll just edit in the adjustment in position.

### **Alicia** (2013-03-27 16:33:59)

As Yuri turns to gaze suspiciously at the Zabrak, this seems to be all the incentive the Zabrak needs to flip over the table. Perhaps luckily most of the drink glasses were already empty as they tip off the table a couple of them shattering onto the floor. Yuri, Ooru and Daegin suddenly find themselves underneath the table along with the Arkanian and Ka’ra. The table’s occupants barely get a word in let alone react before the Zabrak bolts off into a dark corner.
Even prepared, the cloaked Mandalorian finds that he’s quickly lost his target as the Zabrak runs behind another occupied table and into the darkened corner of booth. Kal could perhaps take the shot, but at the risk of hitting one of the patrons instead. Since this is Torga’s establishment, he probably wouldn’t take it well his patrons were getting attacked by his own ‘employee’.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

OK.. I did an initiative check to see whether or not anyone would have been able to stop him and I rolled a nat 20 for him with everyone else around the teens.
He would have reacted right when anyone showed suspicion, so that means with DA’s post he was pushed into action, and because ‘Nak’ won initiative there was no time to prepare the move object.
Go ahead and roll a new init for this encounter.
To get out/untangled from the table, it will be a move action for the Arkanian, Daegin and Yuri, but only a swift for Ooru and Ka’ra.
As for the map, only use it to reference. I’ll likely make up something as we go along for you guys to use.

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-03-28 13:39:53)

Although his weapon was already aimed at the Zabrak, Kal did not expect the speed by which his target moved. Not wishing to be the subject of Torga's ire should he accidentally hit an innocent customer, instead of shooting, the Mandalorian opted to just pursue the impostor.
Weaving through the tables and people in the bar, Kal chases after the fake Nak Simm.

"**WHAT THE…**" can be heard in Jawaese as the table comes crashing over him. In the blink of an eye the Zabrak is flipping the table and already on the move out of the establishment.

The action takes Ooru by surprise but he lands relatively safe, rolling with the fall as his back hits the floor. He stands slowly, brushing himself off.
"**I've heard of the tables turning but this…**" he mutters.
The blessing - and curse - of a fight in a place such as the *Corusca Gem* is that there's likely going to be a lot of players if things don't stay calm. Ooru knows this, and assumes everyone else does too, so he chooses to react without haste... for now.

As Kal nears, a high scream erupts from the shadowed alcove followed by shouts of surprise. Suddenly, several aliens pile out of the booth, scattering in all directions. “**Thermal detonator!**” one of them yells, bolting toward the gaming machines. Hearing this, patrons in nearby booths likewise scatter, screaming. The ensuing chaos is enough of a distraction for all the occupants of the shadowed alcove to disperse, which Kal finds out as he gets close enough to see clearly through the shadows.
Having untangled himself from beneath the table, the Arkanian followed by his escort of guards cautiously duck down behind the various tables at the threat of the detonator keeping their eyes open. “**Kal,**” Thraka barks over the din of the confused, retreating patrons. “**What do yo see?**”

### **KUPALISSSS** (2013-04-15 13:41:06)

Kal tries to remain calm amidst the chaos. His years of experience taught him that a clear head is demanded to gather as much details in a short time and in such pandemonium. Taking note of the person who shouted thermal detonator, Kal then shifts his attention towards the alcove where the alleged bomb is located, assisted by the electrobinoculars built into his armor to pierce the darkness.
As a safety precaution, Kal activates his personal shields, his vision slightly warping as the protective field hums into existence.

Staying put might mean an opportunity to exercise his talents for healing, though Ooru decides to make for the main entrance as fast as possible. It's almost certainly not the only exit but anyone hoping to get lost in the confusion, including Nak, will likely head in that direction too.

The Neimodian who had shouted about the thermal detonator is already making his way with the rest of the alarmed patrons toward the exit. This retreat from the back bar begins to cause a rippling effect as more patrons within the gaming sections learn of the threat. A mass exodus, not altogether calm, immediately begins to clog the exists near the front. Not wasting time the staff tries to keep the calm and Ooru can hear them making offers in an effort to encourage the patrons to return after the crisis. Ooru has already made it about half-way to the main entrance, his Force enhanced speed allowing him to make it before most of the vacating crowd.
Scanning the crowd as it vacates the back bar, Yuri’s senses are overwhelmed by the sudden sense of panic caused by the threat of the thermal detonator. Or at least that’s the most likely explanation as Yuri has completely lost the Zabrak. Even as Kal cautiously takes a look into the darkened alcove he sees it is empty; void of the Zabrak and the alleged thermal detonator.
Ka’ra has quickly recovered herself and joins Daegin in scanning the crowd her concentration on the gaming area. Having ducked behind the overturned table, her back to it, she has her rifle drawn. There’s no sign of the Zabrak they had shared drinks with.

He spots a Neimodian who is running quite fast for the exit.
*Neimodians hate physical exertion. Even in the threat of danger he wouldn't be moving that fast.*
He looks over at Ka'ra as he pulls his comm link from his utility belt. "**We need to stop that Neimodian**" He says pointing at the one that shouted about the thermal detonator.
He lifts up his comm link to put that same info out to the rest of his team, hopefully without alerting the Neimodian. "**There is a Neimodian sprinting for the exit. We need to stop him.**"

**“It’s a ruse! There’s no thermal detonator!”** Kal reported to Thraka, his voice amplified by his armor’s external speakers. **“No sign of the Zabrak either!”**
The Zabrak couldn’t have just vanished. Could it be that they’re facing a shape shifter? He’s heard the stories before, all the while he thought they were just that; stories. It seems he’s wrong.
Apprehensive that he’d be a laughing stock among Thraka’s group, he decided to keep his suspicions to himself.
Kal then searches the crowd for the Neimodian with the intent to pursue. If indeed it's a shape shifter, he hopes it hasn’t changed its form in the ensuing chaos.
