<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Titan&#39;s Valiant</span> Hammerhead cruiser
Commanded by Captain Prius, this cruiser serves as your base of operations.
Serving on the line in fleet engagements as a courier and as a command ship of large fleets, the Hammerhead-class cruiser was a workhorse of the Republic and a common sight near Republic-controlled worlds. This ship could also undertake independent operations, unlike the Foray-class blockade runner, which was never observed outside a supporting fleet. Hammerheads were able to enter atmospheres and land on planetary surfaces.

This shuttle was used mainly for the transportation of cargo. The first section upon boarding is the cargo bay, which has already been loaded with a series of palettes of various goods. Passing an airtight hatch you can see what little living space the shuttle provides. There are double bunks of fold down cots set into the wall, enough for a crew of six. The head is set into a room on the wall next to what passes as the mess. Beyond another hatch is the cockpit which has seats for the six crew members to strap in, the foremost being for the pilot and co-pilot.

Nyriaan is the fifth planet of the Luire system. Rich in madilon, a rare, naturally occurring alloy that could be used to make hyperdrives smaller, there is very little else of value in the system. Of the seven planets that orbit the system's white star, which is also known as Luire, Nyriaan is the only habitable world. With an atmosphere that is made up mainly of nitrogen and oxygen, and a mean temperature of 40 °C, the planet is covered by a thick, cloud layer which blocks communications and makes unaided landing almost impossible. Large storms are common and can last for months at a time. They pose a constant threat to settlements, so they are monitored by the Tempest Observation Bureau. Five of the remaining six planets are gas giants with countless small moons. The last planet, Cailte, is a frozen, irregularly shaped asteroid, rarely noticed by passing prospectors.
The planet surface consists of plains and low hills, with some valleys, where boggy conditions have formed. In the northern hemisphere, there are many shallow, rocky valleys, which are where most of the planet's mining operations take place.
Up until the last few decades the region around the planet was considered haunted due to the vast amount of ships passing through who never returned and spacers made an effort to avoid the system. After the loss of several survey ships, the Republic issued a rescue mission to investigate the cause. Using a primitive made gondola tethered to the orbiting starship, a team of surveyors arrive safely on the surface locating the crashed ships but none of their crew. Prelimary surveys of the planet are conducted from the ground and a laser comm array to communicate is established allowing communication directly to their ship. The madilon ore is found in the soil and soon Czerka Corporation and other individual mining operations begin to stack a claim on the discovered riches. Settlements are quickly established with use of an updated gondola technology, which has recently been replaced with a more reliable laser transport arrays. The laser transport arrays allow properly equipped vessels to land on the planetary surface. As the technology is open to anyone, the Hyperspace Navigator's Guild succeeds in pressing the Senate to require legislation to require that bonded navigators assist with the LTA-assisted landings.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Nyriaanans (near Human)</span>
The Human natives of Nyriaan, also known as Nyriaanans, appear at first glance to be of a typical Human stock. Their skin is pale and their eyes are well suited to Nyriaan's dim light. Nyriannans are stocky, although a good deal of variations exists in body types depending on an individual's clan or tribe. Their current native population is unknown, but has been estimated to significantly outnumber the amount of incoming settlers and prospectors.
The spoken language, referred to as Nyriaanan, is a mixture of High Galactic and Basic that has been combined into a unique colloquial dialect.<div style="text-align: right;">
![Locus-GOI.jpg](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110112021656/starwars/images/d/d5/Locus-GOI.jpg)
</div>

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Locus</span>
The planetary capital of Nyriaan is Locus, which is built around the remains of the Republic vessel of the same name. Home to the only starport on the planet, Locus is not controlled by anyone superpower or government. Instead, the city, which is built in a pinwheel shape, has been divided into different sectors, each of which is controlled by a different faction. In addition to the aligned sectors, several neutral zones in Locus cater to independent miners, prospectors, and traders.
The largest of the city's aligned sectors belongs to the Czerka Corporation. Czerka has a long-standing interest in Nyriaan, either because the planet represents such incredible profits or because the Corporate Sector is unwilling to admit that the madilon it takes from the planetary mines is more trouble than it's worth. The Corporate City Sector is heavily trafficked by armed security, and high walls topped by stun fields surround it on all sides. In addition to facilities that cater to Czerka employees and house its day-to-day operations, the Corporate City Sector of Locus also features a small starport, complete with advanced Laser Transport Array receivers.
The Republic Sector is the next largest of Locus's regions. Although it changes hands several times over the course of Nyriaan's history, the Republic Sector is the most recognizable part of the city, no matter the era. Upkeep is sporadic, sector services are largely undependable, and security is alternately lax or heavy handed. Although far from a slum, the Republic Sector does not compare favorably to the Corporate City Sector in a variety of ways.
The Neutral Zone is in the center of Locus. In addition to housing the planetary government after its establishment, it is also home to Nyriaan's one true spaceport. Raised gondola transport systems and a wide net of Laser Transport Arrays surround the facility like iron flowers. The sector's services are provided by independent contractors and are, therefore, more reliable than those found in the Republic Sector. Living conditions decline the farther from the spaceport one travels, and neighborhoods farthest from the city's hub are little better than slums. The majority of Nyriaan's criminal activity takes place in Locus's Neutral Zone. Criminal syndicates, such as Hutt kajidics and Black Sun, operate there with relative impunity. Violence, while not common, is not unknown in the seedier parts of the sector. The Neutral Zone also provides a haven for espionage, as agents from the ruling factions rub elbows with one another in cantinas, speakeasies, and supply depots.

## Chapter Four: What the Hutt Beholds

### **Alicia** (2012-06-15 10:38:30)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Chapter Four: What the Hutt Beholds</span><div style="text-align: right;">
![NarShaddaa-TOR.jpg](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100730194537/starwars/images/b/bb/NarShaddaa-TOR.jpg)
</div>

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Nar Shaddaa**</span>
Nar Shaddaa became a criminal haven and gained a reputation of being the center of illegal operations in the galaxy, earning the moniker "The Smugglers' Moon". Now distant from most galactic trade centers, the moon was allowed to run its own affairs with little outside interference. During this time, the Exhange has been taking control of the moon, acting much like a government by imposing its own form of order wherever it sees fit. Though the Hutts continue to fight the Exchange for control of the world, their power has waned, and Nar Shaddaa is, at least temporarily, firmly in the domain of the crime syndicate.
Sections of the urbanized moon's vertical city included the Duros Sector and the Corellian sector, which contained three bars popular with bounty hunters — The Burning Deck, The Slag Pit, and the Meltdown Café—as well as another corner tavern called the Orange Lady.
After the Jedi Civil War ended, Nar Shaddaa became swarmed by thousands—if not millions—of refugees from destroyed worlds across the Galaxy, and still more ex-soldiers from both sides in the conflict choking up its spaces looking for work and / or new homes. Its refugee sector was one of the most crowded in the entire galaxy, and tightly controlled by the Exchange. The Exchange was exploiting the refugees to lure any remaining Jedi into their hands.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Corusca Gem Casino</span>
The Corusca Gem Casino lies in a rough neighborhood but tries desperately to attract the high rollers. The outside of the casino is brightly lit and accessible, while the inside is a bit dimmer, with some positively dark corners here and there.
![783px-CoruscaGemFloorplan.jpg](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080602154158/starwars/images/thumb/6/6c/CoruscaGemFloorplan.jpg/783px-CoruscaGemFloorplan.jpg)
**Front** Bar: Half a dozen bartenders move back and forth between a bank of drink synthesizers, mixing cocktails for the forty or so different aliens gathered at the bar, and a never-ending stream of waitresses coming and going.
**Lounge**: Behind the front bar, a small lounge caters to the more privileged customers, safely cut off from the noise and the chaos of the less fortunate gamblers—and protected by a vicious-looking Human bouncer. The little lounge is packed with Toydarians—a private party, or maybe just a tour group. A pair of Rybet waitresses stand by, looking alternately irritated and confused.
**Cashier**: The cashier’s cage is a heavily barred affair, with a thick wall of transparisteel between the cashier inside and the line of slobs outside. An armed guard watches the line warily,
tapping a stun baton on the side of the cage restlessly.
**Back Bar**: The bar at the back of the casino is a cozier affair: three bartenders, half a dozen waitresses, and a few isolated, intimate tables. The people back here don’t want to be seen; they’re here to do business. There’s not a bouncer insight, but the bartenders look more than capable of handling any minor disturbances. For that matter, so do the waitresses.
**Refreshers**: Several different doors mark which species can be served in which stalls. The refreshers might be cleaned several times a day, but with the constant stream of customers coming and going, the place is a mess. A spot of blood on the floor indicates that the bouncers use this place as an office to explain economics to overextended gamblers.
**Gaming Machines**: Hundreds of beings of all species sit at row upon row of beeping, chirping, flashing game-comps, hoping to hit that one random combination that sets them up forever in a life of luxury.
**Gaming Tables**: The center of the Corusca Gem is the game pit. Dozens of tables, lined with gamblers of three times as many species, buzz constantly with the rhythm of the Hutt stock exchange. The dealers, dressed in exotic uniforms, hustle games of sabacc, three-handed princess, rebo, and a host of other games, while the pit bosses— Devaronians, Togorians, Shistavanen, a Besalisk, and even a Wookiee—keep a watchful eye on the commerce.
**Kitchen**: The kitchen bustles with activity: Ortolan chefs working at make tables; Togruta pastry chefs putting together delicate dishes; Gossam busboys washing dishes. The place is filthy with grime and garbage, but everyone’s too busy to care.
**Guard Station**: Gruff security guards—Advozses, Iktotchi, and muscle-bound Grans—stand grimacing at various doors and strategic points throughout the casino.
