# Conspiracies At Every Turn (Yuri and Drem)

**Drem and Yuri** Chapter Two prelude
Sajin takes his leave of Yuri and Drem as he agrees to go and catch Fiolla up to speed before starting his shift guarding the Force Harvestor. The two of you, find yourselves alone outside of the lift doors still on the level with the hanger bay.

Yuri watched Sajin depart, and then turned towards Drem.
**"Well, where do you think we should start? Those guys probably don´t recognize me, so if you´ll point me in their direction, I could talk a bit with them and see if I get anything out. You could try and skim through their personnel files or quarters to try and find something suspicious"**

Drem thinks for a moment, letting his mind drift back to the floor he was on. **"Um … now that I think about it, I'm not quite sure what deck I was on … I think it might've been over on Deck Three where some of the living quarters were. To be honest, though, I was more interested in hearing what they were saying and didn't pay that much attention, you know?"** Thinking on it a moment, the scout scratched his chin and asked, **"How about we ask about the Jensen guy and see what people know about him? Maybe we can find out who he's spotted with or where his quarters are?"**

Shaking his head and smiling at the scouts story, Yuri nods.
**"Sounds like a good idea. You don´t happen to know what he does aboard the ship? Might give a good clue as to where we should start asking about him"**

Drem thought back. **"I know he wore an officer's uniform … and that there were a few others with him,"** he replied. **"Thing is, if they would've just went on talking, I probably wouldn't have pestered them. But this Jensen guy had to escort me to the lift … like I had ruined something. Just pretty odd behavior if you ask me. Maybe we should both take a look at the personnel files and see if there's a lead to follow? Beats just standing here scratching our heads …"**

**"Yeah, though that´s why I suggest that I handle any confrontation and interaction with this Jensen guy and his associates. Since you seemed to have walked in on something less than official they were discussing, it would most likely seem odd if you try talking to them. I was thinking however that I could try to maybe lure them into thinking I´m with them. I´m not an official employee of the Republic, and bounty hunters have a reputation for having…shall we say "flexible" loyalties"**
He stepped into the turbolift, inviting Drem to come along.
**"But you´re right, let´s start at the personnel files"**

Following right behind Yuri, Drem stepped on the lift. **"I suppose you could be right,"** he commented. **"But it would be better to know who we're dealing with."** As the scout waited for the doors to close, his face twisted in a questioning glare. **"Hey, you think this has anything to do with the gizmo that we brought back? What if they're a rogue faction of Jedi or worse, Sith?"**

Yuri gave casual shrug of his shoulders as the doors closed.
**"Could be. I don´t want to speculate whether it has anything to do with the Harvester or not, but if it does, I´ll bet you it´s one of them. Most likely rouge Jedi in my opinion, probably associated with Jut-Hakk´s gang"**
His face twisted into a slightly worried look.
**"Though it would seem very rapid response indeed, of anyone was already coming after the Harvester, it hasn´t been with us that long. That would almost hint that someone on the inside had leaked information about our operation…"**
Letting his trail of thoughts end there, he though that perhaps they should make a discreet request to see if any new crew members had been transferred to the ship since they brought the Harvester on board, or closely before.

(( To move this along, what is the proposed next step? Asking crew members about Jensen or finding a terminal for his public record?)

I would say checking the terminal for his public record and seeing where his bunk is. DA, does that work for you?

((I would agree. Checking records and similar things before talking to the crew))

Upon finding the first available computer console, the duo begin their search through the public records of the stationed crew looking up using the only name known as a keyword. With five results presenting themselves, Drem is quickly able to identify their suspect via his photograph.
Kyle Jensen has been stationed on the Titan's Valiant for nearly five months. A career officer, he's been distinguished numerous times his most noteworthy following the last war in which he managed to rescue fellow crew at personal risk. The public files gives a brief summary of his tours and achievements as well as some released personal information, but otherwise doesn't list where his quarters are.

Thinking for a moment, Drem said, **"Well, if he served as long as he did, odds are that *someone* on the ship would know who the frak he was."** Looking over the file, the scout asked, **"Yuri, got a datapad handy? If we download the image, we can ask around and maybe see if we can find his quarters. I'd imagine it'd go smoother if we had the image. Right?"**

**"Yeah, I think you´re right"**
Yuri fished out his datapad and tried to download the information they had find, including Jensen´s picture and file, as much as he could access.
**"I´d like to check a few more thing with the records though. First I´d like to check up any new crew transfers since we returned with the Harvester or around that time. Though it seems rather amateurish to make such a mistake, but any such transfer could be worth looking into. Second, it might be worth our while to cross reference the crew manifest with people who Jensen have served with in the past, especially those guys he rescued in the war. If we get any matches, perhaps you can identify any of them as the guys he was hanging with"**
((
I´ll try to do those things myself, but if I lack clearance or something, I guess we´ll have to find someone who can help us
))

It's easy enough to copy his public record from the computer to the datapad. You both realize that this obviously isn't his entire record, there's going to be more which his superiors or even other crew members would be able to access with their clearance.
With your current clearance of the ship's databanks you are unable to get a complete crew manifest of the *Titan's Valiant* nor the manifests of the other ships Jensen had served on in the past. From what you can tell though, since the ship has not made their way to any sort of Republic port in the three days since you had returned with the Force Harvester, there have not been any crew transfers. Looking over the public log, it's been over a week since the T*itan's Valiant* has been to a Republic outpost of any sort where a transfer may have taken place.
