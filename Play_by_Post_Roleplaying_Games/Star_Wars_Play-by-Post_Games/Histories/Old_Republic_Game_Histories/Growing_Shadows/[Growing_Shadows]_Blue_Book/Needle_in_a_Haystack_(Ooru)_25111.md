<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Telia V</span>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

A temperate world consisting of 60% water, it’s continents are encompassed by a multitude of forests and dotted by tall mountains. The wilderness of Telia V makes for a diverse study of the Living Force and survival as a whole.
A subterranean outpost, essentially a bunker, was established by Jut-hakk nearly four years ago near the start of the Jedi Civil war. Management was taken over by Lanius only two years ago for his use in his research and training of other Force users brought to him. A small garrison is kept on the planet, most of them recruits waiting to be trained by Ka’ra. Aside from Lanius there are four other well trained Force users stationed there to assist in the training of new recruits.
The bunker was built into the side of one of the mountains using a series of natural caverns which were reinforced to withstand bombardment. The natural properties of the rocks prevents invasive scans of the base and the lush life keeps it relatively hidden from discovery.
The levels are relative to depth within the mountain. Since natural caverns were used, tunnels and shafts were constructed to connect the sections together.
Ground level: Hanger
level 1: Barracks, armory, labs, infirmary
level 2: training center, meditation rooms, library
The bunker has two (or more) entrances. The most obvious being the entrance via the hanger. Since the bunker uses the natural caves through the mountain it’s likely there are other entrances via the infrequently explored tunnels (or can get close enough via an outside tunnel to cut through).

SoroSuub's FA line of service droids included the popula r FA-4 pilot droid, used throughout the galaxy as personal chauffeurs and inexpensive copilots for freighters and yachts. Programmed primarily for starship travel and built for easy storage when not in use, FA- 4s are also frequently used as airspeeder pilots and even ground vehicle drivers. They are particularly popular in political circles because of their "privacy buffer," which allows the user to wipe the droid's memory of destinations and overheard conversations with a simple voice command.
Despite their advanced proce ssors, however, FA-4 droids are not programmed for combat operations. They are wired to avoid attacks and other hazards, but cannot make use of ships' weaponry to fire back.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Ooru Okin**</span>
Male Miraluka Jedi 3 / Noble 1
&quot;*All of reality is a canvas to me. I am the brush, the Living Force is my palette&#8230; and the gallery? The gallery is your mind.*&quot;
</div>

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ooru Okin was born the illegitimate son of representative Jor Okin by one of his many mistresses. Like his half-brothers and sisters, he never met his parents and was raised instead by Jor's private nurses at a country estate. Unlike them, his mother was a Human and, thanks to her, he had actual eyes. They were vestigial and didn't work, themselves clouded over to give an eery visage to an already odd child. The nurses could tell something was even more uncommon about Ooru though, and after a while many simply refused to be near him. Hallucinations, voices, irrational behavior - these were commonplace for anyone who spent enough time in his presence. The Luka Sene was finally contacted on his fifth birthday when, to the amazement of the nurse staff, he made them all look like different staff members. It took some time to sort it all out but he was finally whisked away with a guarantee of safety - for everyone. Few ever knew of his true appearance because his face was often covered in traditional Miraluka fashion. Not even his teachers at the academy were aware of his mixed heritage.
As Ooru grew during his time at the institution he realized the unique nuances of his special "Force Sight" - the ability of all Miraluka to perceive their surroundings despite no optical organs - and the nature of his connection to the Living Force. He had a natural aptitude for the aspects of the Force that involved perception and understanding and, through meditation and guided training, learned to control the ability. Ooru enjoyed studying ancient civilizations and mythologies and in time was able to read a wide array of languages with ease. His interest went beyond the cultures though, and he often adapted what he read for use in his illusions. It became a regular occurence to see Ooru Okin's latest re-enactment of some forgotten battle or long-lost expedition in the halls of the Luka Sene academy. The show was made all the more interesting by his inability to perceive colors naturally - something unexpected but somehow fitting in the young artist. Watching his ghostly pale actors and actresses parade among the shadows of bygone eras was no less enjoyable for their lack of hue.
Ooru loved learning about everything, but particularly life and its many processes. The intricate balance of a body's systems and how each part worked in such harmony was the source of neverending wonder for the young Miraluka. He would often impress his professors by sitting in their classes and providing a detailed construct of an individual system while they taught younger students. One of the few friends he would ever have, a Zeltron girl named Vyrna, was more interested in technologies. They met in one of those classes where, to everyone's amazement, Vyrna began to explain the benefits of cybernetic replacements over natural grafts - not a very popular view among Force sensitives. Ooru listened intently, then re-worked his construct to incorporate her suggestions. It was the beginning of a friendship on a level few in the galaxy would ever experience. The two spent countless hours sharing their knowledge, and hearts, through telepathic conversations. It was actually Vyrna who alerted Ooru to the dangerous consequences of his recent studies.
While pouring over old records of ancient traditions, Ooru discovered a small trove of Sith knowledge in the academy archives. It was only a few glyphs and a manuscript, but he spent the better part of a month finding out all he could about the scraps of a history best left forgotten. It was a dark path to walk and he was careful to not delve too deeply. It nonetheless gave him some new and terrible ideas about the use of his powers. Before he could complete his research the academy learned of Ooru's interest in the Sith and determined to confront him about it. Vyrna heard the rumors and, judging her friend was in greater danger from the Sene Seekers than from any old scroll, warned him of the academy's plans. Ooru left within the hour with no more than a fleeting telepathic goodbye. He was able to escape the grounds without being noticed and sought passage off-planet at the nearest spaceport. For more than a year he wandered from system to system, continuing his studies as much as possible but always wary of being discovered.
Ooru Okin was contacted about joining Jut-hakk's Brotherhood after narrowly escaping some Sene Seekers that had followed him back to Alpheridies. He was meeting with his childhood companion, Vyrna, who had recently left the academy and would soon be taking a position as the planet's lead cyberneticist. The two enjoyed their reunion and soon lapsed into a telepathic conversation like they used to do in years past. The Seekers interrupted and before long Ooru had to flee his homeworld once more - but not before the ember of childhood friendship had been fanned into something more. It was another bittersweet departure but not, they promised, a permanent one. His first year in the Brotherhood was spent under young Master Davian's tutelage from whom he learned to hone his Force abilities and to study some of its basic telekinetic applications. Though it took a great deal of concentration, Ooru eventually learned how to use coloration in his illusions through guided meditation. His current mentor - Master Tonin, Davian's twin brother - prefers a more direct approach to life's challenges. The twins also gifted Ooru with his robe and lightsaber pike - the trimmings of a great warrior worthy of the Brotherhood. He was deeply honored to be welcomed in any setting for the first time in his memory, and he displays both with great pride. While the majority of his brethren spend their time lifting stones with their minds and participating in saber duels, Ooru still prefers perfecting his ability to manipulate others' perceptions - and he's getting very good at it.

</details>

**Appearance**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ooru Okin is a 22-year-old Miralukan of athletic build. His muscle lays taught across his thin frame and, while he by no means would boast of amazing strength or agility, he has a certain attractiveness in his wiry, almost elven, appearance. His hair hangs loose around his shoulders, well-kept and dark. Ooru wears a simple cloth wrap that covers most of his head in traditional Miralukan custom. Beneath it, however, lies the greatest of Ooru's illusions: two jet black eyes. They are vestigial - a result of his Human mother's physiology - and few know of their existence. Like windows into some bottomless chasm, they lend him an alien appearance unsurpassed in its savage beauty. He is content to dress comfortably in a simple tunic and pants as well, shunning fashion for function out of a desire to both rebel against the status quo and be able to blend into a crowd.
When on assignment for the Brotherhood he wears a black hooded robe with deep orange trim - a gift from Master Davian. His lightsaber pike was a gift from Master Tonin, and it's dark handle and bright orange blade rarely see much combat. When not active it simply completes the picture of a stereotypical blind traveler. It's an image he encourages, since his dismissal often avoids unnecessary confrontation. When things do heat up, though, those nearby discover an intriguing - and sometimes frightening - manifestation of Ooru's powers. His appearance is often reflective of his mood: subliminal and emotional currents impact his attire and surroundings visibly. The result only adds to his already mysterious presence.

## Re: Needle in a Haystack (Ooru's story)

### **Alicia** (2011-10-31 18:05:48)

*Stand by for incoming transmission…*
*Transmission Start; Audio only*
Ooru, I’m glad to see you’ve been making good use of the *Star’s End*. Any sign of Master Jut-hakk and my brother? I heard all of the escape pods have been recovered and haven’t received any reports to their recovery. Blasted orders. Lanius and his team from Telia V haven’t surfaced either. Now there’s someone as secretive as our Master... (long pause)
You’re heading to Telia? Guess that’s as good a place as any to start. If we haven’t received word then maybe they have. If nothing else you can find out what Lanius has been up to holed out in his base all that time. Let me know what you find out.
Tonin out.
*Transmission Complete…*<div style="text-align: right;">
![Odan-urr.jpg](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20060102001620/starwars/images/b/b6/Odan-urr.jpg)
</div>

The Adsern sector on the Out Rim is off the beaten track as it were. While you were able to use a hyperspace lane to get there, easing several hours off the journey the ship had to cut across wild space to ultimately arrive. The binary stars shine brightly as they fight over control of the eight planets with their multitude of moons. The sixth planet is your destination - Telia V. Taking an initial orbit with the planet's lone moon, it takes a sensor sweep to locate the specific frequency marker on the planet - as Davian and Tonin taught you - which directs you to send a tight beam with your authorization code. Once confirmed, the ship is sent back a set of coordinates on the planet for your pilot to approach. Beginning the descent, Ooru is given a good view of the planet itself. A temperate world, its continents are encompassed by a multitude of forests and dotted by tall mountains. One of such mountains the droid pilot indicates to be the destination.
The massive hanger bay greets you as you step out of the *Star’s End*. The Dynamic-class freighter dwarfed by the surroundings. Built out of the very rock, massive pillars rise up at various intervals to secure the rock ceiling above. The bay itself seems capable of holding three freighters and many fighters, though the only contingent you see is about five snubfighters.
From a hallway, a tall Dreathos emerges, his arms folded within the sleeves of his grey robe. He stops a meter away and offers a bow of his long neck. “**On behalf of our brothers on Telia, I greet you, Master Ooru. I am Odan-Urr. I have been directed to assist you during your stay here.**”

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-01 12:07:46)

The massive rock cavern was impressive in itself, the fact that an entire facility had been integrated into its caves and twisting corridors was downright incredible. Ooru Okin stood patiently in front of the ramp, ready to exit and anxious to begin his investigation. Master Jut-hakk's disappearance, and those of Master Davian and Lanius as well, was cause for great concern to the Brotherhood and he intended to get to the bottom of things as quickly as possible. Finding Lanius seemed like a logical first step since he was tending Acheron base when it was destroyed, but rescuing survivors had taken the better part of a day. While Ooru was glad to have helped in the efforts it had definitely cost him time.
*I will find you brothers, you and our beloved Master.*
The young Miraluka made his way down the loading ramp as it extended to the hangar deck, a rare display of impatience - something Master Davian would have noticed right away. The orange trim of his robe dragged across the bare rock as he made for the approaching Dreathos. He returns the bow with one of his own and pulls back his hood.
"**Greetings to you Odan-Urr, but it's just Ooru - I'm not a Master yet. And thank you for your kindness, but I don't intend to stay long. I'll need all the communications to and from Acheron base before the disaster and as much information as possible about what Lieutenant Lanius was working on there as soon as you can get it to me please. Finding Master Jut-hakk is of the utmost priority, and I believe he may be the key.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

It's really difficult to not use words like "see" and "peering out the window". I like it. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif) I think I've got it right, please let me know if I messed up the details. Is Lanius a Master as well?

</details>

---

### **Alicia** (2011-11-01 22:49:56)

The Draethos bows his head and motions for Ooru to follow him into the rock hew passage. “**The transmissions will be easy to get you as all but the most secret of communiques are kept on file.**” He pauses as he considers the rest of the young Brother’s request. “**However, Lanius has always kept a close guard on his research, sharing it with only Master Jut-hakk. I’m afraid all I know his latest project was done at the Master’s request. It had taken him off world numerously, but to where and why I can’t say.**” As the Draethos speaks he leads Ooru through the corridors, some of them natural and a large assortment of them carved to connect the natural pathways. In the maze it seems very easy to get lost, but the Miraluka’s guide seems to have very little trouble.
Passing various doors and hallways a ramp in the corridor takes the two men down deeper into the mountain. Odan-Urr stops in front of a large double set of doors and with very little effort he pushes them aside to reveal the library within. Rows of datastores, and even a few bookshelves are neatly spaced in the cavern turned library. Suffice to say, the library is an impressive collection. In the center a few tables with computer panels have been set up for the studious Brothers. Stepping into the room, the Draethose taps his long spindly fingers on the controls for one of the computer panels accessing the communication logs.
“**Ah, here we are.**”
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

There aren’t many entries from Telia to Acheron. The most recent timestamped two days previous was a request from Lanius for a shuttle from the planet to make their way with supplies. The manifest is listed:
Starship parts - 3 tons, carried in sacks or bundles
Corrosive substances - 7 tons, sealed in barrels
Sundries - 4 tons, carried in sacks or bundles
Sundries - 12 tons, loaded on palettes
Foodstuffs: common baked goods - 5 tons, stacked on palettes
Construction materials - 8 tons, sealed in barrels
Medical equipment: assorted medical supplies 4 tons, loaded on palettes[/list:u:2ddkddua]
The crew was to expect an extended mission and was to prepare accordingly.
The log before timestamped four days prior was an order from Jut-hakk to Lanius to rendezvous with him at Acheron Station, but doesn't list any specifics. By the looks of it there was a private message attached.

</details>

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-02 13:49:11)

Ooru had expected *someone* to know about whatever it was Lanius was working on, but then a secret project is often an explanation in itself.
"**I sure would like to know what that private message said, but either way we've got something to go on. Those supplies seem fairly ordinary… except the *corrosive substances*.**"
They could be for any number of things, so Ooru makes a note of them but moves on. He wonders at the destination of the "extended journey" but then realizes the shuttle may be easier to track than secretive Masters...
"**Is there any way to see exactly what shuttle was dispatched and whether it was found in the Acheron wreckage? It's presence - or absence - could tell us more about the whereabouts of Lanius, Davian and Master Jut-hakk.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, it's a longshot but who knows. I'm assuming that their deaths haven't been felt in the Force and that if the shuttle was parked in the base when it blew up there'd still be some sort of "black box" transponder going off. Maybe not.

</details>

---

### **Alicia** (2011-11-02 15:15:42)

Standing off to the side patiently while Ooru looked through the recovered records, the Draethos steps forward once more to take a look for himself. “**Yes, of course. Here it is. It was a *Herald*-class shuttle designated E3452. Master Lanius’s Mandalorian companion and his apprentice Fiolla are listed as passengers in addition to the cargo.**” There’s a hint of distaste when he mentions the Mandalorian, but it’s covered quickly. Stepping out of the way he allows the young man to take a look for himself.
The names of the two crew members and Ka’ra Bralor and Fiolla Narcassan. all of them still unaccounted for, including the shuttle.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-02 15:47:18)

*Still more names to follow, but we're getting closer…*
Excited to finally be covering ground in his search, Ooru continues the attempt to zero in on Lanius and the others.
"**Okay, excellent. Has Master Lanius' ship been recovered from the Acheron wreckage? If not, it's a safe bet they're all together somewhere.**"
He spends a few moments in silence, processing Odan-Urr's answer and trying to formulate a better plan. All he can come up with is more questions:
*What happened at Acheron base? What's the "extended mission" Lanius referenced? Seven tons of "corrosive substances"? Could the private message from Jut-hakk actually help find our Master - and is that a path I'm willing to travel?*
Ooru's voice is quieter, his tone suddenly less impatient. He starts to realize this may not have been the tragedy it appears, and that their "missing" Masters may not be lost...
"**Odan, has anyone determined what the cause of the explosion at Acheron even *was* yet?**"
Ooru grips his pikestaff tightly, beginning to sense something deeper at work.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Does that work better? I'm calling him by the first half of his name - is that appropriate? It's easily edited.
I would also like to **Take 10** on a **Use the Force** check to *search your feelings*: Will accessing the private message from Jut-hakk to Lanius help in any way? (presumably it will, but you never know - it could've been an inside joke about the power twins or something)

</details>

---

### **Alicia** (2011-11-02 21:50:16)

The Draethos shakes his head at the young Miraluka’s inquiries. “**I’m afraid there hasn’t been any indication that Lanius was on the station when Acheron was destroyed. However, I did see a report from the engineers of the base indicating the reactors began to unexpectedly overload and they were unable to locate the problem in time. Fortunately, the reaction was caught in time to provide personnel to evacuate.**” He pauses and seems to consider what he'd just said. "**It is strange that Lanius hasn't contacted us at all.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The plot thickens.... Sorry for the short post.
You do get a positive feeling about attempting to access the private message.

</details>

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-02 23:35:12)

"**Hmmm.**"
Ooru nods at this new information - and insight - from his Draethos brother.
*So if everyone has survived but no one has checked in…*
The Miraluka leaves his station and begins to pace the library slowly, head down and hands folded behind his back, deep in thought. He considers the possibility that it could have been a last-minute escape and communication was not possible, but that seems very unlikely. These are Masters, after all, and not some uninitiated fanatics. It could also be that whatever secret project they were working on required an immediate departure, but then why no communication? No, there's reason here, intent. Ooru just has to find it. He stops and turns towards the display, reaching out to the Living Force for guidance. His shadowed sight begins to shift as his mind's eye delves into the matter at hand.
A few silent minutes pass while Ooru senses his next step, and then reluctantly suggests what he already suspected : "**Odan-Urr, I need to see the contents of that private message. Everything else is secondary to the safety of our Masters… including whatever secrets they may hide.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Not sure if you're wanting Ooru to do the hacking or not, he can certainly *aid another*. It's not really his area. Here's a Persuasion check if you want it to convince Odan:
**Persuasion +10**
*Take 10* for a total of *20*

</details>

### **Alicia** (2011-11-03 00:43:00)

Odan-Orr watches Oorui with almost seemingly inexhaustibly patience, which seems only to be the result of his age, his hands neatly folded within the sleeves of his cloak as the younger man paces in his attempts to piece together the puzzle. Considering Ooru's request for a long moment, the elderly Draethose bows his head as he reaches a conclusion. "**I will attempt to assist you in acquiring the transmission, but I fear my abilities in this area may be lacking**" Taking a seat at the vacated station, Odan-Orr begins to enter a series of commands into the terminal. After nearly an hour, what first sounds like buzzing static transforms into an audio message.
*Transmission Start; Audio only*
I must say, you've done exceptional work, Lanius. It was exactly where you said if would be. Don't worry I'm not going to rush into anything. Not without studying its capabilities further. That's why I want you to join me on Acheron - to continue your research with the genuine article within your grasp. I want to make sure it's stable before we move it to Avemus. My plan is to have it there within a weeks time.
Oh-hoho. Imagine the possibilities with the Force Harvester within our grasp!
*Transmission Complete…*
As the audio file ends the Draethos is holding perfectly still and, if Ooru was to guess right, looking considerably paler than he had just a few minutes ago.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Note: I decided on actual character attributes for Odan-Orr. Sorry for discrepancies.
Avemus is also the base you left from (where Tonin requested you go on the hunt), which is also considered Jut-hakk's main base of operations

While Odan's visage may have lightened a few shades, there are some noticeable changes in Ooru's appearance too. He and the area around him seems to grow darker somehow, the shadows deeper and the colors muted. Ooru Okin has studied much in his short time - even learning the basics of the Sith language - but nothing quite so ominous as this. The very mention of a *Force Harvester* brings a sense of foreboding to his mind, though he's not certain why. He knows nothing of the specifics, but what good could come from the use of such a thing?
"**Odan-Urr, brother, you know about this… device?**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, not as deep a post as I had originally thought it would be, but still necessary I think. You said he wouldn't know about it, but Odan obviously reacted to its mention so I think it's a logical question for Ooru to ask. I purposefully haven't read anymore of the other story at this point because I don't want to miss some good RP by jumping to a conclusion, and since it's just Ooru's story I'm not holding anyone up. Still finding my groove with the character, as it were. Plus I think some conversation could lead to some logical destinations - there's only so many ways to hide a lifeforce-eating-machine-of-death, you know? Ooru can probably skip the local pawn shops...

“**Indeed so,**” the elderly Draethos starts. Still deeply disturbed by what he heard he remains quiet for a long moment. “**It is not a device to be trifled with. Created with Sith Alchemy it was used as the power source for a very powerful weapon. One might say it was a destroyer of planets quite literally consuming the very life Force of the planet while the weapon destroyed with fire. During the Great Sith War it was the cause of a great loss of life until Ulic Qel-Droma managed to defeat it and Exar Kun, its creator.**” Turning off the terminal he stands, using his hands to push off the table. “**I had thought the records lost, and for good reason. The Great War was a dark time and many histories were lost.** 
“**If Jut-hakk commissioned Master Lanius to find it, I fear to what end.**”
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

And there you have it... Make of it as you will..

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-04 01:18:10)

Ooru jaw drops slightly at Odan's response, his hands dropping to his sides. He cocks his head to one side in disbelief and, if it wasn't hidden beneath his head cloth, the Draethos would clearly see his upraised eyebrows. The words take several moments to fully sink in. Ooru takes a seat and plays at his chin with one hand while tapping the fingers of his other hand on the table. He reviews what they've uncovered so far, trying to connect the pieces of this extraordinary puzzle:
"**So Master Jut-hakk and Lanius were searching for this Force Harvester and found it. Lanius receives a message requesting his presence on Acheron base with a private attachment explaining that it had been found. Lanius arrives at the base and, two days later, sends for a shuttle - equipped for an 'extended mission'. Shortly thereafter Acheron is destroyed by reactor problems that took just long enough to allow most of the personnel to escape. Among the wreckage we find neither Master Lanius' ship or the shuttle; nor any sign of him, or Master Davian, or even of Master Jut-hakk himself. This is *most* troubling.**"
*Well 'ru, life just got a whole lot more interesting…*
"**I wouldn't tread the path of fear just yet, but I think even more extreme actions may be called for brother. Before we get much further though, let us allow the Living Force to aid in our efforts. Is there someplace more appropriate we can go to begin to make sense of all these things - a meditation chamber perhaps? I'd like to employ a little more patience than I'm used to, and with a little luck I'll be able to reach out to Master Davian. We must find them all Odan-Urr, for the sake of the Brotherhood and, maybe, the *galaxy*.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, here's the plan just so you know. Let me know if you have any problems with this or whatever: 1) Use **farseeing** on Davian since that's who Ooru has the closest bond with and since that's who he was originally sent to find anyway, 2) If that works (and I think it will) Ooru can then use **telepathy** to ask "*Where are you?*" Unless he's in another quadrant, *taking 10* on that will probably succeed. 3) If those things don't work, or don't reveal enough useful information, then we'll try searching Lanius' quarters for clues as well.
For what it's worth, I'm totally enjoying this. Thanks again. ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

Odan-Orr nods, listening to the young man's assumptions. Outstretching his hand he indicates a door on the far side of the library. "**Take that door and choose from the meditation rooms. Send me a signal should you need anything else.**" After waiting a few moments to see if Ooru should need anything else, he gives a small bow of his head and then turns and proceeds out of the library.
The indicated door leads into a hallway with seven more doors, 5 of which have a lit panel in an array of green and red indicators in which 2 doors are marked in red - possibly indicating their occupancy. The first door on the right is the closest door without a lit panel and taking a look inside presents a number of folding table and chairs. The other door without an indicator seems to lead into another part of the complex. The meditation rooms themselves are simple with high ceilings which have been untouched by the facilities builders - small stalactites spot the rocky recesses. An array of cushions in a corner of the room are provided to make the occupant comfortable on the rock floor, which is strangely warm to the touch. The door panel has a locking mechanism and also a control for the lights cleverly placed int he ceiling with the option to not only dim them but turn them to a different shade.

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-04 14:41:32)

"**Thank you, I will.**"
Ooru returns the bow and proceeds into the indicated hallway, choosing the nearest chamber. Since it has always helped the most, he turns the lights off completely and makes his way across the cavern floor to one of the cushions. He sits with his legs crossed, pikestaff laying across his lap, and pulls his hood up and over his head. His hands find their place within his sleeves and he begins.
*Where are you Master…where have you gone?…*
Concentrating on his first mentor in the ways of the Brotherhood, Master Davian, Ooru Okin reaches out through the Force. Leaving the chamber, the base, the planet, the system - his mind's eye roams the stars, seeking his lost Master. Had someone peeked through the window just then it would have been a sight most memorable:
His huddled form seems ablaze with a white-hot flame, burning slowly and billowing up and through the rocky ceiling. The dark room is illuminated with countless stars and grey nebulae, suddenly zooming in to focus in crystal clarity on a planet or ship then backing out just as quickly. Pale comets and ghostly vessels emerge from the walls only to sail across the chamber and disappear into the opposite wall. Living beings - those within the ships and on the crowded planets - appear as bright orange specters amidst the sea of shadows. The floor, too, seems to sink away and Ooru appears suspended against the stellar backdrop - a lone traveler of the cosmos without having left the room.
*…where are you, Master Davian…?*
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Use the Force +15** *farseeing*
**Use the Force +15** *telepathy* "Where are you?"
I'd like to *take ten* on both. If it makes a difference, and if it's not against the rules (guess I never thought about it), I'll use a FP on one, but not both. If the *farseeing* works, I'll let you know if I want to apply the FP to get a clear picture of the surroundings when I see what happens.

Ooru seems to wander the cosmos for a long while, urged to begin walking his steps pull him toward the asteroid field where Davian was last seen and heard. Suddenly a sense of despair comes over him and one by one the stars surrounding the Miraluka’s field of vision begin to disperse, blinking out one by one until there’s only the field of asteroids. Those too begin to fade and before long Ooru is left in a dark emptiness.
But he’s not alone. Reaching out into the darkness, Ooru finds what he seeks. Surrounded by the overwhelming vacuum, all the young Miraluka can see is a dark haze surrounding the seemingly unconcious form of Davian. He jerks as Ooru makes his mental contact, his body starts tremble, but then something slams down on the connection severing any hope of further communication or sight of the lost mentor.
Ooru comes out of his trance, jerked by the abrupt severing of his connection with Davian. In the blackness of the room, he is perhaps reminded of the disturbing visuals brought forth by his vision.

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-04 16:09:47)

The sudden disconnect shakes Ooru physically and the pikestaff falls from his knees, clattering to the rocky chamber floor. He lies on his back, still in the darkness, pondering what all this could mean.
*I must get to the bottom of this, and quickly…*
Ooru picks up his pikestaff and makes haste for the door. Once in the hallway, he retrieves the com-link from his belt:
"**Odan, I believe there's something far greater at work here. We have few clues and little time to put them together, but *speed* is of the essence. Please meet me in the library as soon as you can.**"
The two brothers discuss Ooru's vision in the meditation chamber and its sudden interruption, before the troubled Miraluka makes a desperate suggestion:
"**I sense danger in store for Master Davian, and the others, if we don't act fast. The time for subtlety is over, Odan, we need to search Lanius' quarters for anything that might indicate their destination.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Persuasion +10** in case Odan-Urr needs convincing that this is an appropriate course of action. I'll roll, just because I'm tired of taking 10. I'm reckless that way. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

### **Alicia** (2011-11-05 16:22:53)

Odan-Orr arrives in a short while, meeting Ooru in the library like he requested. The elder Brother has found his calm and is pensive as the Miraluka recounts his vision. Taking a long moment to consider the information he remarks, “**It would seem that someone with a remarkable amount of power is attempting to block young Davian from outside influence. The fact you were able to glimpse him was probably a weakness in his captor’s control.**”
With a nod of agreement toward Ooru’s assesment, he adds, “**It is indeed time to check. This way,**” with a sublte turn of his head, Odan-Orr motions for Ooru to follow. Leading him back the way they had come initially, up the ramp to the first level, yet down a different corridor than the one they took from the hanger bay. The new corridor is full of doors on either side. Some of the panels are lit up, others are dim perhaps indicating availability. There doesn’t seem to be much order to which rooms have residents and as Odan-Orr leads Ooru down the hallway a female Mrlssi is exiting her room. As they pass each other the Mrlssi bobs her head in greeting, her plume of brightly colored orange feathers ruffling slightly with the motion.
Odan-Orr stops at the door across and just past from the Mrlssi’s and after entering a code into the door’s panel it opens. Adjusting the lights to fade on, Odan-Orr steps aside to allow Ooru to enter and get his first look of the facility’s Master. The first thing Ooru notices is the smell, as if something at one time was rotten.
The room itself is sparse with little in the way of decorations - a large framed picture of some nebula hangs on an otherwise bare wall. Along another is a series of bookcases filled with texts and other unusual collected objects which wraps around to be interrupted by a door into what must be the bedroom. A desk and chair rest among the bookcases a computer terminal and a few orderly stacks if flimsiplast and datapads litter its top. A table and chairs rest underneath the framed picture and is relatively clear except for a datapad with a small bin of miscellaneous weapon parts and a tool set.
There’s signs that two people reside in these quarters from the bits of paraphernalia, the two sizes of clothing in the bedroom and the double sized bed. There’s a nest of sorts made of blankets in a corner of the bedroom where Ooru discovers the stench is the strongest. On top of a dresser Ooru spots the framed picture of a smiling family of nine and a couple more datapads.

Let me know if you want more details on something. I tried to give general descriptions of things which might draw his attention right off the bat.

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-07 09:56:43)

Ooru walks through the of the rooms methodically, searching for any obvious clues.
*The datapads are an easy check, but Lanius wouldn't have left anything too important out in the open like that. The rest of this stuff… I don't know. We can't afford to miss anything though.*
"**Odan, who else was living here? And what in the Force is that *smell*? There's got to be something in here that will tell us where they've gone. If Davian is being held hostage as you suggest, and I believe you may be right, then we must not fail.**"
Ooru returns to the bedroom, beginning his search by examining the nest of blankets where the strong smell seems to be coming from. Not content to leave before gathering as much information as possible, he moves on to the dresser with the picture and datapads. He also searches the front room - the bookcase and stacks of notes on the table, the bin of parts and, lastly the picture of nebula.
"**Do you think you can find anything on this?**" he asks Odan-Urr, pointing to the computer terminal.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, I'm not sure how to compose a post that says "Ooru checks everything"...lol...but here's some rolls for you:
**Perception +5** Take 20
**Use the Force +15** Sense Surroundings
**Knowledge (galactic lore) +9** to identify the nebula in the photo in case it may be a map or location of significance to the search, as well as to glean clues from the bookcase and "collected objects" and perhaps understand what the blanket nest is all about (animal, species, habit, etc.).
***25*** <- [16] 1d20 + 9
**Knowledge (technology) +9** to identify the weapon parts and deduce what sort of weapon could've been made (like a modified or hidden one).
***18*** <- [9] 1d20 + 9
I think that covers everything, let me know if I missed something!

### **Alicia** (2011-11-07 11:29:00)

Glancing around with his own search the elder Draethos doesn’t seem too thrilled with the smell either. “**The Mandalorian woman’s pet. A strill I think she called it. She mostly kept it out in the wilds so it could hunt or on her ship so the stench wouldn’t bother the rest of us. The smell is rather pervasive, is it not?**”
Having missed it on his first glance around, Ooru discovers a hair brush with long strands of red-hair stuck in the bristles as well as a stand of sorts meant to hold a set of armor next to the door.
The nest reveals nothing but a mottled assortment of blankets and a few pieces of clothing the creature apparently stole or was given. Overall it’s relatively clean of debris, just smells from the creature being in it.
The datapads on the dresser are in a language Ooru isn’t familiar with, but from what he can tell one appears to contain letters to “Ka’ra” and “Ori'vod” from someone named “Tamara”. They’re dated for the last few months. One of the pads is almost undiscernible but if you were to guess it's poetry of some sort. The last datapad is blank, the data card having been removed.<div style="text-align: right;">
![363px-MandalorianKOTOR.jpg](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20061216182304/starwars/images/thumb/e/e5/MandalorianKOTOR.jpg/363px-MandalorianKOTOR.jpg)
</div>

The family portrait has two older humans - a male and female - in their early 30s. The ‘father’s’ hair is black cropped short, while the woman's is a distinguished red, braided long over her shoulder. The father is wearing a rather heavy looking set of armor. Surrounding them is seven children up to the age of 15 - 4 males and 3 females. Only two of the children, a pair of red-headed girls, seem to match the two parents in resemblance the others sport different color hair and one is even Zabrak.
The eldest is a 15 year old male, with is short cropped blonde hair, he is wearing a set of armor - Mandalorian Crusader armor gauging from the helmet tucked neatly under an arm. One of the girls around the age of 8 has her hand on top of a strange creature which appears to be on the verge of pouncing on the camera.<div style="text-align: right;">
![Fileiddcc9z729_10d5v4p9gg_b.jpg](http://i125.photobucket.com/albums/p63/aliciababy86/Gaia-SW-GS/characters/Fileiddcc9z729_10d5v4p9gg_b.jpg)
</div>

The creature is 6 legged furry mammal with sharp claws and an oversized fang-filled mouth. It is about 1 meter long, plus a whiplike tail. The flabby brown fur and black patched hide hangs in loose folds most of the time, which accounts for much of its ugly look.
Looking at the back of the picture, Ooru discovers what he guesses is a year equivalent to 3,976 BBY.
Moving the search to the outer room, it reveals little in the way of hard evidence. The objects prove to be little more than knick-knacks the young man has collected and the books seems to be personal copies of things one might find in the library, mostly literary works. Several of them are in languages Ooru doesn’t recognize, though one seems to be an old text written in the same language as Ka’ra’s datapads.
The notes on the desk are mostly requests from certain Brothers to import this or that for their own research or notices they would be leaving the compound and when they might be expected to return. In all, Ooru gathers there might be a dozen Brothers who call this facility home, but only a quarter of them are here at any given point.
There is one order from Jut-hakk dated over a week ago to transfer about 50 recruited soldiers from the compound to Avemus as well as an order for Ka’ra Bralor to be transferred with them as a trainer. Attached to that note is a refusal from Ka’ra to never set foot there again, but that she would consider moving elsewhere for an additional fee and makes a suggestion of several planets near Avemus which would make a suitable training ground. Ooru would recall a shuttle arriving just before he left carrying such troops.
The datapad on the table is an advanced guide to weapon maintenance and repair with the parts seeming to match the diagrams in the guide and are in various states of repair. Otherwise there doesn’t seem to be much of interest.
As Ooru goes to exam the nebula picture, Odan-Orr looks up from the terminal. “**I remember Lanius joking about how Bralor apparently didn’t like how sparse his quarters were and managed to get a copy of this particular phenomena framed. He mentioned it had some personal importance.**” The corner of the picture has a small placard on it with a date of several months past and the nebula’s name.

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-07 17:43:54)

Ooru studies every detail intently, desperately trying to see the connections.
*So Lanius was living with Ka'ra Bralor, a Mandalorian. They had some sort of pet - a strill? - that smelled twice as ugly as it looked. She wasn't fond of returning to Avemus but Jut-hakk wanted her to train some soldiers; presumably the ones I saw landing before I left. The weapon parts and armor stand probably belonged to her, the odd poetry and notation recorded in her native tongue. I still don't see what any of this could tell us about where they are right now…*"
"**Hmm. I wonder if the nebula itself could be a destination?**" Ooru wonders aloud.
*…and this Force Harvester, how does that fit?*
"**Odan, could the Force Harvester be used as a weapon by itself? Would it need anything special, perhaps a certain staging area or fuel or something?**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, that's what I've got. I'm still pretty much in the dark here. In the movie they try to calculate the Falcon's destination off of its last known trajectory - is that something that applies here, would they have a record of when a ship made a hyperjump and its orientation?

### **Alicia** (2011-11-08 09:43:30)

Hard at work at the computer terminal, Odan-Orr pauses for a moment as he considers the young Brother's question. "The Force Harvester absorbs the Force around it. The absorb energy was then used to power the Dark Reaper's weapons. By itself and in the wrong hands, the Force Harvester is as deadly as any other devastating weapon. I"m afraid I don't know more than that."
Indicating the terminal he goes on, "**I do have some good news. I've managed to access some of his personal files. However, none appear to be related to the Force Harvester.I feel what will give us the best answers is his personal log, which I fear is beyond my ability to access.**"

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-08 11:35:03)

Ooru rests a hand on Odan-Urr's bony shoulder and watches as he scrolls through the files.
"**Perhaps together we can fare better. If I may…?**"
He leans in and begins tapping away at the keyboard. While computers aren't his area of expertise, he is quite familiar with technological devices in general and the knowledge may serve him well. He continues his inquiries as he works, occasionally pointing on the screen or asking for Odan's advice about piece of data:
"**Was Lanius typically a recluse? Was he very secret about all his work, or is there anyone else still around that might be able to help determine where he may have gone? For that matter,**" he pauses, "**What exactly is this facility used for - didn't most of the research take place at Acheron?**"
He waits for Odan's response and grabs a chair for himself from the other side of the room... *This could take awhile.*

### **Alicia** (2011-11-10 17:37:39)

“**Like most of us, he does keep to himself. I think we were all a bit surprised when he brought Bralor here nearly a year ago. If he confided in anyone it was her, however I know he was still in communication with some people outside of the Brotherhood. How much they would know…**” he shrugs his old shoulders in obvious defeat of that line of thought.
The Daethos’ tone grows proud almost like a father would be as he continues, “**The facility here is dedicated to the amassing of knowledge. Lanius himself has commissioned us all to do what we can to make this library rival that of what once was Osus, before the Sith destroyed it decades ago. Those who come here generally seek guidance or pursue knowledge from our collection.**”
Letting Ooru take the lead, Odan-Orr stands over the young man’s shoulder helping him in any way he can and directing him away from things he’s obviously tried. It takes the better part of the day, but after diligent work Ooru is finally able to break the passcode on Lanius’s personal log. With blurry vision he looks over the logs, the most recent immediately coming up.
*Recovering log. Record date (4 days prior)* 
It would seem the time we’ve been planning for has come. Jut-hukk has found the Force Harvester. I’ll be leaving shortly to join Jut-Hakk on Acheron and I plan for Ka’ra and Fiolla to join me in a couple days. Not before meeting up with the Niandra as planned of course. I’ve already commed her from the *Atin Oya’ka* and everything is in order. The pilot Ka’ra has found for the *Atin* is overeager, I think, but Ka’ra seems to like him so I will trust her judgement.
Ka’ra remains strangely optimistic about the whole affair, even though in the end the two of us may end up dead. We’ve done what planning we can to anticipate every possible outcome and so we’ll just have to trust in the Force. *Ib'tuur jatne tuur ash'ad kyr'amur* as Ka’ra’s people like to say. It’s a good day for someone else to die.
*End log* 
*Recovering log. Record date (7 days prior)* 
Final preparations have been made and not a moment too late. Jut-hakk has become restless in his quest to resurrect the Dark Reaper. Soon I will have to tell him the location of the Force Harvester and then we will have to put our plan into action. The idea of betraying the trust of the man who’s been my mentor these last few years doesn’t sit well with me, but what else can I do? I wish the blasted thing could just be destroyed, but Force knows what repercussions that would have.
(long pause)
Ka’ra believes those she’s selected for the team will make the rendezvous with the *Titan’s Valian* and is on her way back. She’s chosen well; mostly former Jedi and Republic soldiers. I’ve decided to allow Fiolla to partake in the mission as well. However she doesn’t entirely know what’s going on as of yet. She still believes Jut-hakk to be the benevolent founder of our order. I’ll let her stay blissfully ignorant for awhile yet.
I'm please Niandra is willing to participate in our scheme. Who would have thought such an outstanding Naval officer would assent to such dealings behind the Republic's back. She's certainly come some ways since the war. But I don't plan on her ship being the base for long, I have another idea in mind for a long term solution. I don't think Ka'ra will like it.
*End log* 
What follows in prior logs are his recollections and status notes on his research into the Force Harvester. He notes the more he learns about the artifact the less eager he is to find it. He's not sure why Jut-hakk wants it, but has a feeling that anything involving it can't be good news. It's nearly a month and a half prior that Lanius discovers it's location and attempts to stall the release of information to Jut-hakk realizing that something has become horribly wrong. He doesn't go into much detail, but he sounds anxious.
Some of the records provide details into the plan he and Ka'ra are slowly formulating to keep the Force Harvester away from Jut-hakk, but know it would only delay the inevitable for him to find it. Lanius also wants to hold faith that his fears are unfounded and that Jut-hakk has some fantastic plan to use the Harvester for some beneficial goal.
He recounts some personal details about his friend Niandra (an old war buddy who had been promoted to captain of the Titan's Valiant. He's amused to retell how shocked she was to find out he was still alive, believing he had died during the Civil War) and also about his growing relationship with Ka'ra, his confusion over his feelings and admittance of such.
*Recovering log. Record date (several months prior and before the date on the nebula picture)* 
My visit with Master Jut-hakk has resulted in three things. 1) A task from my Master to find out what I can about an old artifact, something I’m eager to provide him. 2) Myself on the bad side of a pair of boys dubbed the ‘Power Twins’ and their affiliates mainly because of… 3) becoming the custodian of an abused and angry young Mandalorian woman.
How she ended up as the prisoner of Veret Thar I don’t care to guess, but the fact she was allowed to be treated the way she was, no matter who her people were, is unfathomable. Veret found it curious the young woman had a natural resistance to the Force and decided that she was the perfect candidate for his line of research. Suffice to say, such research never would have been approved had he been in the Jedi Order, nor the Republic for that matter.
I’m taking my time in returning to Telia. There are no pressing matters to attend to other than my master’s request, and besides, I doubt my new guest will be much of a fit in the quiet sanctity of our growing library. It’s best to let her recover her wits some before subjecting my compatriots at Telia to her presence.
Though I’m not sure what’s worse. Davian and Tonin’s ire, or the stench of the creature they insisted was this Mandalorian’s.
*End log*

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-11 12:34:23)

Ooru reads and re-reads the entries, deep in thought and careful to consider every detail. The hours fly by and soon he finds himself in growing need of rest.
"**This tells us a lot of things Odan, but I'm still unsure of what our…my next move should be,**" he says at last, standing and stretching his limbs. He's wary to include anyone else in this mission but thankful for the help. "**If Lanius is to be believed - and I must admit that appears to the the case - then our Master has tread down a dark path. I shudder to think what he could do with such a terrible device. My task is now not only a matter of finding Master Jut-hakk and the others, but rescuing and, if possible, saving the Brotherhood - and the *galaxy*.**"
Ooru yawns loudly and retrieves his pikestaff from leaning against the table. "**I think I need to rest before going much further though. I'll head back to the *Star's End* to radio Master Tonin and change into clothes that don't smell like a Mandalorian pet. If you have quarters available here I'd be most grateful to use them - I may be sleeping aboard that ship for the foreseeable future and I would appreciate anything that doesn't resemble a spartan mattress and durasteel frame for one more night's slumber.**"<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

Once aboard the *Star's End*, Ooru composes a message to his current mentor and friend, Master Tonin:
"**I apologize for the delay in getting back to you Master, it seems there's far more at work here than we initially thought. I've had a great deal of help from the local administrator, Odan-Urr, and have been able to reconstruct a chain of events that started long before Acheron base's destruction. It appears Master Jut-hakk was in search of something called the Force Harvester. Lanius found it but was hesitant to give it over, fearing its use in any way could be dangerous. He schemed to keep it for himself and, as a result of that scheme, destroyed Acheron by overloading its reactors in some way. There's no sign of any of their ships in the wreckage, so it's safe to assume they all made it out alive. I tried to contact your brother, Master Davian, through the Force but the connection was severed abruptly. I believe he's alive, as I'm sure you've also sensed, but in danger. Lanius has a crew working with him, including a Mandalorian lover it seems, and, unless I'm mistaken, they're operating from a ship called the *Titan's Valiant*. That's likely where they are right now, so that's where I'll be concentrating my efforts - if that's alright with you.**" Ooru pauses to make sure he hasn't left anything out, then finishes with "**Okin out.**"
The Miraluka hybrid strips down to his undergarments and stows his vestments, including his hooded robe, in the ship's quarters. He changes into a simple grey tunic and pants and, after donning a matching headwrap, settles down for the night.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

So that ship doesn't have a fresher, FYI. If Odan has a place for Ooru to stay, then hopefully he can hit the fresher before bed. I think I've gleaned what I can for now, and Tonin asked to let him know what I found anyway, so that seems logical at this point. Enjoy your weekend!

Odan-Orr stands off to one side, apparently decided his participation would not delve into reading the facility administrator's personal logs. He's content to look over the many artifacts Lanius has collected and on occasion pulls out one of the volumes, *hmming* over what he finds. The elder Draethos looks up with apt attention as Ooru professes what he finds. Keeping his own thoughts to himself for the time being, he does however, nod at the young Brother's assertions. "**Master Lanius was never one to act hastily, if he betrayed the Master Jut-hakk, then perhaps he felt he was responsible to do so.** Setting down a cluster of crystals he had been examining, he begins to head toward the door. "**Such is the way of the traveler I'm afraid,**" he starts in response to Ooru's criticism for sleeping on ships. "**We would be pleased to host you tonight, and it so happens there is a guest quarters available.**" Leading Ooru further down the hall, he follows it down till it bends and then indicates a door. "**You may use this room. There's a map you can use to find your way.**"
With a bow, Odan-Orr departs the way they had come. The quarters are sparse and much smaller than Lanius's. A simple bed is placed in the corner of the room, with a desk and chair opposite. The room is dimly lit as Ooru enters, but the control panel next to the door shows that the lights are adjustable. Off to the side is a fresher with a small shower carved out of the stone walls. Unlike the rest of the complex, there's an industrial carpeting underfoot.

---

Morning comes all too quickly, interrupted by the buzzing of the door's chime. Outside stands Odan-Orr, looking relatively apprehensive. "**I have news. Come quickly,**" he says, and waits only long enough for Ooru to gather his belongings. "**I overheard Junai at our morning meal saying she saw Lanius return last night. However, I checked the logs and his ship has not returned, at least not through the hanger bay. She saw him leave his quarters barely an hour ago, spoke to him and walked with him toward the eastern side of the complex. From there she says he disappeared into the Deep Reaches - where the mine is.**" While quick the elder Draethos steps are sure footed and it's not long before he's stopped before a long corridor heading deeper into the mountain. "**I can't go further with you, but you may be able to follow him. Be wary, the mine is full of twists and turns, the way to the forest floor is marked, but I can't tell you if that is the way he went. He's been here longer than any of us and could have found another way through.**"

"**Did he say anything to her about where he's been - or was he carrying anything unusual that she could see?**" Ooru asks as the pair travel quickly through the twisting hallways.
*Wish I had time to talk with her, but this might be the only chance I have to find Davian…*
Ooru turns and peers down the length of the deep corridor, pondering his next move. He's grateful for the night's sleep and for the chance at finding some answers, but the Deep Reaches are not familiar territory and rushing headlong into an ambush could be fatal. There's no time to return to the *Star's End* for his robe or equipment, and he feels the draft coming from the cavern against his bare arms. The drab, sleeveless tunic and loose pants will have to be enough for now. He leans on his pikestaff, glad to at least have that with him. Pulling his gray headcloth tight, he replies to his Dreathos companion:
"**Thank you Odan-Urr, I'll have to chance it. The risk of losing a brother somewhere in a mountain is worth losing several in the galaxy.**" he remarks half-heartedly, the rest having restored his dark sense of humor. "**I'm afraid most of my gear is back in the ship though - is there a glowrod I could use?**"
Ooru Okin steps forward, the sound of his boots and staff against the rock echoing down the length of tunnels. He walks slowly at first, reaching out with the Living Force to determine an approximate direction for any Force-users within the Deep Reaches. It's not long before he's jogging through the winding passageways further into the heart of the mountain, as attentive as possible for anything that looks - or sounds - like the right direction.
*If he's still in here he'd probably hear me shout, just before the sounds of the ensuing cave-in. Best to just keep moving…*
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, for starters - he *doesn't* have his hooded robe, medpacs, ration packs, or medical kit. He *does* have the long-range comlink, credit chip, liquid cable dispenser and pikestaff (I figure these things all fit in his pockets or tucked in his belt). He changed his clothes because they smelled like strill and left them on the ship, but he still has some of the things (wallet, cell phone, um, liquid rope and laser sword). I didn't write about getting the glowrod, only asking the question - but I think you said Odan had one he could borrow.
Secondly, I'd like to attempt to get an approximate (or better) direction on Lanius by sensing other FS in the Deep Reaches. I know it won't be specific, but there's not many strong Force-users around so whoever he picks up is probably Lanius.

With a nod, Odan-Orr hands over a glowrod from the confines of his belt pouches. “**May the Force be with you, Brother,**” the elderly Draethos says in farewell. The facility’s presiding administrator waits at the entrance until Ooru can no longer see him.
The tunnels are mostly naturally made, whether burrowed by the native fauna or by the natural forces of the planet. The way is lit by dim red lanterns hanging from the ceiling.When Ooru approaches his first branch the sight of carved markers in the wall cause him pause as he holds up the glowrod in the dim light. One path would take the young Miralukan to the forest floor and the other deeper into the mountain to the mine.
While the young Brother is unable to sense the presence of any Force users in the vicinity of the Deep Reaches, a feeling urges him to proceed toward the mine. Setting his feet onto the path to the mine, the glow rod quickly becomes useful as the lanterns soon become infrequent, casting only their dim light at the cross-section of another tunnel branching. Most of the tunnels are unmarked, though the ones to the mine continue to lead on.
After countless branchings, and after following the Force towards the mine Ooru has the sudden urge to take a different path; one that is unmarked by previous travelers. Following his instincts, Ooru soon hears an echoing sound. Distorted by its reverberations it’s hard to tell if the sound is distant footsteps or of something being struck.

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-10 11:43:44)

Ooru proceeds with caution, dimming the glowrod and attempting to conceal his approach in every way. He grips his pikestaff tightly and prepares for the worst while hoping for the best.
*No telling what sort of things make a home down here…*
Trying to identify the exact nature of the sound is difficult, but he listens intently for any clues as to what might lay ahead.

Cautiously moving further down the tunnel it takes only a moment to discern that the tapping is coming from something metal striking the stone cavern. In fact turning a bend the dim glowrod suddenly refracts into countless rainbows as it hits exposed, unrefined gems within the wall.
The tapping continues, then slows before stopping completely. It isn’t until Ooru is right down the tunnel does he see the wide arc of light from a nearby lantern resting on the floor. A tale human male with light colored hair bends near the light examining a handful of excavated stones. He doesn’t look up as he stands straight.
“**I wondered if someone would come after me, though I should have expected Tonin to send you here.**” Putting the stones into a pouch on his belt he beckons Ooru forward.

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-12 16:33:46)

"**Master Lanius!**" Ooru exclaims, surprised to have actually found who he was looking for. It was clearly the will of the Living Force since Lanius must have been blocking his attempts to detect Force-users in the Deep Reaches. Unless the gems had some sort of special quality to them...
"**There's so many questions…**" he begins, switching off his glow rod and tucking it away. "**I *was* sent by Master Tonin - to find his brother. We thought Acheron would be a good start but then I ended up here. Odan-Urr has been a great help in tracking you down, though ultimately it was Junai that led me here. I tried to reach Master Davian but was cut-off - but perhaps you know more about that…?**"
Ooru is unwilling to offer up more details - like going through Lanius' files - until he's certain of the rogue Master's intentions.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I tend to think if the gems interfered with Force stuff Ooru would be able to sense that being so close, but maybe not.

</div>

As Ooru steps into the light, Lanius turns fully towards the Miralukan Brother. Likewise, the young man gets a better look at the wayward Master. Lanius is young, in his early twenties at least, but there’s a hardness to his face which tells of the hardships he’s had to face. The black of his robes make a sharp contrast to his light blonde hair. As he turns Ooru can make out the sight of a lightsaber hilt swinging next to a hip holstered blaster pistol.
Lanius looks confused for a moment as he takes in Ooru’s words. “**Davian is missing? I thought he would have returned to Avemus by now.**”

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-15 11:15:14)

"**I wouldn't say he's missing - *someone* seems to know where he is. In fact I'd say he's being held against his will since he seemed to be unconscious when I searched him out. I was prohibited from establishing any further contact. It's been quite a challenge finding you, but I have to ask - what are you doing down *here?***"
He continues to probe with obvious questions, trying to determine Lanius' allegiance. All the evidence seems to indicate he's trustworthy, but why couldn't Ooru detect his presence in the Deep Reaches? And what exactly *was* he doing digging up gems anyway?
*And why would you mention concern for one Brother over the destruction of an entire base under your care? Where's the rest of your team? So many questions…*

### **Alicia** (2011-12-15 11:36:09)

Indicating the tunnels walls the facility’s Master answers the last of his questions. “**I’ve often had to mine and sell these stones to help fund the facilities development. While most of our food comes from the planet there’s some things we have to import.**” Ooru gets the sense that Lanius isn’t saying all, but what he does says is the truth.
Lanius looks thoughtful for a long moment and seems to forget that Ooru is there as he turns back to the wall and resumes extricating more of the gems. With sure strokes of the pick he frees a few more of the valuable stones. After examining the gems, he puts them into his nearly full pouch. It’s then he seems to remember that Ooru is there. “**That is quite disturbing news, though I’m afraid I can only tell you he was in the process of departing Acheron when the station met it’s unfortunate end.**”

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-15 23:23:39)

Ooru is puzzled by the response: *Is **now** really the time to be "funding development"? No, there's definitely something more going on here.* He pauses before speaking, searching for the right tone of voice to convey concern rather than accusation...
"**Master Lanius… are you okay? I came here in search of a missing Brother who I now have reason to believe is in considerable danger. In the meantime I've discovered a destroyed research base and even more missing persons - including the Master of our Order - yet you seem relatively pre-occupied with digging for gems in underground tunnels. I confess I don't know the nature of your work here, but surely there are are other more pressing things to be addressed?**"
While his words sink in, Ooru tries to casually detect any outside influences that might be affecting Lanius at the present moment. If Jut-hakk has gained an upper hand in the matter it may explain a number of things - including his lieutenant's odd behavior.

### **Alicia** (2011-12-26 11:54:43)

Even as Ooru tries to detect some outside influence affecting Lanius his feelings tell him the truth. While Lanius's actions might seem strange, there's his own reasoning behind it. More is definitely going on than the older man is letting on.
Ooru's words however seem to have little affect as Lanius just listens to what the Miralukan has to say. Lanius seems to take a long moment to look Ooru over as well, almost as if debating internally how much Ooru might actually know. "**Come. We'll head back and you can tell me what you have discovered about Davian and these other persons you have discovered are missing. Maybe together we can discover an answer,**" Lanius says picking up the lantern and bringing the pick to rest against his shoulder.

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-26 16:23:30)

Ooru nods in acknowledgement and falls into step with Lanius.
*Okay, we'll play it your way…*
Taking the gamble that sharing everything he's learned so far can't hurt anymore than learning Lanius' true allegiance, Ooru begins in a fairly straightforward manner to recount the details of recent days:
"**Master Tonin sent me in search of his brother, Master Davian, as I said. I aided in the rescue efforts from Acheron as soon as I arrived but learned afterwards that neither Davian nor you - not even Master Jut-Hakk or any of your ships - were recovered. I spent some time seeking guidance from the Living Force but that only led to more questions. Little was revealed except that Davian lay unconscious somewhere. I was prevented from learning more, though by whom I could not tell.**"
He pauses, determined but cautious, unsure of how exactly to continue:
"**Eventually we decided it was best to pursue a more… *aggressive* pursuit. Odan-Urr and I gained access to your personal communication logs and attempted to paint a clearer picture of what had happened. We weren't even sure you were still alive, much less did we expect you to return here. And since we figured your activities may have been connected to the others in some way - Davian included - it seemed a logical course of action. We learned… many things. Nothing to indicate where any of you had gone though.**"
Ooru took a moment to collect his thoughts before finishing. Under different circumstances he would welcome to opportunity to study under the lieutenant's direction. If the collection of artifacts and writings in his room were any indication, Lanius knew a great deal about galactic cultures past and present. Ooru would jump at the chance of studying any of them, the Force Harvester not least of all. For now, though, he would have to settle for the task at hand. He concludes transparency is best. Exhaling a deep breath, Ooru finishes his story:
"**Look: Honestly - I don't care *what* you're up to. I'm here to find Davian because I respect him and I'm concerned about his welfare. He and Tonin taught me more about the Living Force than I ever thought possible and I will forever be in their debts. I'm not interested in sabotaged research facilities or an ancient Sith weapon or the destruction of life in the galaxy as we know it - I'm just trying to find my friend.**"

He adds, transforming his appearance to that of a scraggly middle-aged man in tattered robes: "**I can avoid being seen if I wish. But to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.**" ![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)

### **Alicia** (2011-12-30 16:53:01)

Lanius listens to Ooru’s explanation as the two walk down the dark corridor back the way Ooru had come in his search for the elusive Master. With his tale finished, Lanius gives the young Miralukan a grim nod. “**A noble goal**,” he says slowly. “**I will do what I can to help you find Davian.**” Keeping up a quick but steady pace, it’s quite evident Lanius knows these tunnels very well.
Turning at an intersection he motions to keep silent. Taking the lead, he pauses every so often and motions Ooru to follow suit. At first Ooru can’t tell what it is Lanius is doing until a discernible clicking sound can be heard echoing down the tunnel. Taking a dark side tunnel, Lanius seems to be attempting to avoid whatever was making the noise as for awhile the noises echoing down the tunnel diminish.<div style="text-align: right;">

</div>

Rounding a corner of the tunnel, Lanius stops dead and Ooru narrowly manages to avoid running into him. Breathing out a curse, Lanius tries to push Ooru back and away from what’s ahead as a loud screeching sound can be heard up ahead, the tunnels amplifying the sound. Lanius reaches for his lightsaber as two insectile creatures come within the light of the lantern. This bizarre creature has four long legs sprouting from a central body. Another long appendage sprouts from the "face", which ends in a sharp stinger. As it draws closer Ooru catches a whiff of their pungent odor, though it's hardly as pungent as the Strill's.
"**Vipers… Don't let them sting you,**" Lanius warns and is almost drowned out as his green blade is activated.

*And still you give me only half-answers…* thinks Ooru, following steadily behind. He's not sure why Lanius seems intent on addressing only one of the many issues at hand but since it *is* the reason Ooru was here, it will do for now.
The fact that the Deep Reaches may have had native inhabitants hadn't escaped his thoughts. The smell is unwelcome but the opportunity for battle is most certainly not. Ooru ignites his lightsaber pike and the bright orange light spills onto the stone walls, mixing with the deep green of Lanius' own saber. He swings the weapon around in a wide arc overhead as the energy blade takes form and brings it to bear on the vipers. Master Tonin taught him well enough how to dispatch opponents in such a fashion, but Davian's training in the Living Force suddenly takes hold and Ooru raises his right arm toward the nearest viper before rushing headlong into the fray. With a flick of his wrist he sends the creature hurdling through the air towards his companion...

## Chapter 1 Round 1

### **Alicia** (2011-12-31 00:09:04)

The Force is indeed Ooru’s ally as the closest insectile creature is lifted up from it’s four legs and deftly tossed at what one would think is a bone crushing force. The unfortunate beast collides into its partner with a loud bang and the two are knocked to the floor.However, the two hardly seem shaken as they regain their feet and charge at the two intruders. As one of the insects charges toward’s Lanius, Ooru is able to bring his pike around connecting with the creatures exoskeleton, but as the lightsaber connects the success of his attack of opportunity distracts him that he’s unable to avoid the other’s stinger as it shoots out at him.
Catching him in the shoulder, Ooru feels a burning sensation begin to spread throughout his body. “**Ooru!** Lanius shouts in concern, his green blade smoothly slicing through his own attacker’s stinger in two quick strokes as it attempts to land its own blow on him. “**Retreat!**” The insect screeches in what Ooru can only guess in pain as it’s nearly cleaved in two.

Ooru shouts in pain as the stinger lodges itself in his shoulder. He can feel the poison coursing through his veins immediately but rips out the emptied barb anyway and stores it in his belt for later analysis. Considering the extent of the wound, retreat seems like a reasonable suggestion. He looks back and forth between the giant insects and decides Lanius is right. No matter how much Ooru may want to vent his frustration on the vipers, falling dead from poison in the Deep Reaches - even with Lanius present - is probably not a good idea.

Caught between the two Kinrath, Ooru turns bring his pike around to attack the hewn Viper Lanius very nearly finished. The pain his shoulder spikes and the young Miralukan loses his grip on his pike, cause his attack to miss.
Redoubling their efforts the two Vipers slam their bodies against their opponents, however the two Jedi are able to easily avoid the insectile creatures’ movements. Raising a free hand, Lanius calls on the Force and while not affected Ooru can feel waves of force rushing and pounding around him. The Viper closest to Lanius let’s out a final screech and is knocked to the stone floor, twitching in its death throes. The remaining Kinrath is also knocked of it’s feet. “**Ooru, move it,**” Lanius commands his attention still very much on the last viper.

The venom threatens to overtake Ooru and Lanius' words reach his ears with an echo - not all due to the acoustics of the stone walls. Falling back sounds like a great idea, but not before taking a parting swipe at the downed viper. He grips his pikestaff with both hands and swings with all the strength he can muster, hoping to wound the bug enough to slow its pursuit - if not finish it off entirely.

### **Alicia** (2012-01-02 00:08:16)

Taking a parting slash at the prone Viper, Ooru retreats to beside Lanius. However the creature is gaining its feet as Ooru takes his hit on it and follows the wounded Brother as he withdraws, making a final charge at Lanius with it's stinger. Distracted, Lanius is unable to block the stinger with his lightsaber and it tags him in the chest. Gritting his teeth through the pain he raises his hand once again. "**Sleep,**" he commands and the Viper obeys, collapsing to the ground on it's suddenly unstable legs.
Drawing back against the wall, Lanius disengages his lightsaber and clips it back to his belt unsteadily. He pulls out the barb from his chest, examining idly before casting it aside. With some of his composure regained the master approaches Ooru. Holding up the lantern he exams the wound on Ooru's shoulder parting some of the fabric of the bloodied t-shirt. "**The poison is spreading. We should make haste back to the compound.**" While Lanius puts on a brave face, Ooru can tell from the shared symptoms the poison has entered Lanius's bloodstream, but his body seems to be resisting it better. While the poison is weakening Ooru in shorter span, it's working much more slowly in the Master.
Moving past the bodies of the chopped up and injured Vipers, Lanius takes them down the corridor they had been taking before running across the Vipers. In the next cavern, the lantern light shines over large red eggs which seem to be glowing with a faint pulsing light. "**Seems the Kinrath have expanded their nest,**" Lanius comments idly before taking a branching corridor.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The poison hits Ooru for 5 damage and -1 CT
The poison will continue to affect Ooru, and the both of them may be forced to stop to make recovery actions. The trip back will take over 15 minutes going at a normal pace at which point there will have been 90 attacks. (as you probably wouldn't survive that amount I'm just going to make 15). Having made the rolls and knowing that Ooru would end up unconscious. I'm going to move on to the next part after your next post. Assume at the end of yours Ooru will end up unconscious. However, if there's something you wish to have addressed before that time we can RP that out as well.

Ooru watches the Kinrath fall asleep, content to be out of immediate danger but concerned for what the poison is doing inside of his body. His tunic is torn and his shoulder bloodied, but hopefully the two can make it back to the main compound before succumbing to the effects of the venom. He shakes his head to keep awake and follows Lanius through the tunnels. The somber mood is intensified only by the impending danger and need for stealth. Ooru spots the Kinrath eggs at Lanius direction and wonders if he'll have a chance to study them in-depth at some further point. It's getting harder for him to continue and, before his knees give way, he tries to inform Lanius:
"**I don't know… about facilities… but I have some… medical training… and supplies in my ship…**" he manages in little more than a whisper, before collapsing to the hard stone floor.

*…sad that he left the medpacs in his ship.* I hope that's what you were thinking, I'm okay with anything else. I don't mind leaving my stuff, but I'd like to at least get the robe back if at all possible. I was thinking something different back when I left it.

Lanius catches Ooru as he collapses, his face grey and showing the strain. "**Rest Ooru,**" he says somberly and it's the last thing the Miralukan remembers before the blackness takes him.
*The blackness seems impenetrable, and Ooru can't keep himself from falling deeper into it. A dim light draws his attention and it takes a long moment to be able to turn to face it. At least he's able to focus on it and suddenly the light overwhelms him as comes next to it's source. A bright bubble slightly larger than a man now blocks his path. Ooru can tell there's something within, but as he reaches out to touch the edge it bursts into a dark red light and an electric shock forces him back. However, where Ooru had touched it a small hole is left, large enough he can peek through. Inside drifting among the electrical currents is Davian.*
A loud steady beeping sound brings him from the depths of his unconsciousness. After a long moment, he realizes it's the beeping of a heart beat from a heart monitor. "**He's waking up!**" a female voice exclaims and opening his eyes Ooru can make out the shape of a long plumed creature standing over him. "**Don't worry dear, I was able to cure you of the poison. It was a rather close call, but Master Lanius was able to carry you here safely.**" Her high voice carries to words out quickly and the young man's sluggish mind takes a moment to interpret them.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-02 17:49:08)

Ooru processes the words slowly, then sits up on his elbows suddenly: "**Lanius - *where is he?***"
In an instant Ooru's adrenaline allows him to survey the immediate scene - and it's about what he would have expected. He's no doctor, but his medical knowledge does extend to treating various diseases and poisons and he knows he's fortunate to be alive. His shirt lay folded at his feet, a bandage on his shoulder where the Kinrath's strike had landed. He stays on the table for the moment, not wanting to rush things. Ooru's overall gratitude to be alive is balanced, however, by a growing concern that having found the only person who might be able to help find Davian, he may have lost him again.

### **Alicia** (2012-01-02 23:31:19)

The Mrlssi opens her beak in a smile and pats him gently on his uninjured smile. "**Don't be worrying about him, that boy has been stung more times than he can count on his hand. Never learned to stay away from them that one.**" Helping Ooru to sit up she continues in her quick pace. "**He's taken to resting in his quarters. If he's even doing that, never idle that one.**" Satisfied Ooru isn't about to tip over she hovers a small scanner over his chest. "**All the poison is gone, but you'll have some aches for a couple days. I advise you too take it easy. No more jaunts into the Deep Reaches for awhile, ookkkaaay?**" The last word is drawn out, and she looks at him seriously and for his affirmation before moving off.
Able to focus on his surroundings now, Oorus sees he's indeed in a medbay of sorts. The clinic is of the fashion of all the rooms in the complex, carved from the natural stone the only oddities are the medbeds, one of the two Ooru found himself on. The Mrlssi leaves Ooru to go back to cleaning up the other bed and discarding the used bandages and detox machine. Cabinets along the walls house an array of medicines, their identities obscured by the glass.

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-03 00:35:19)

Ooru takes his time re-adjusting to his feet and getting dressed. The wound was still very sore, but he couldn't feel the burning in his veins like before - evidence that the venom had been neutralized. He was glad to have had the presence of mind to save the barb since it would almost certainly make for some interesting research. The delivery system of the poison, its composition, and how best to protect against it in the future all were just some of the possibilities of studying the sample. Of course *now* wasn't the best time for that.
"**Thank you,**" he says to the Mrlssi doctor, "**I'll try to stay away.**"
Straightening his shirt sleeves, Ooru retrieves his lightsaber pike and heads out of the medical suite. Checking in with Lanius is definitely a priority but since he doesn't know where things will lead from there he decides to pick up his other equipment from the *Star's End* just in case. Pausing to check the straps on his medical kit, he ponders the events in the caves:
*I don't think this would've been as handy in the caves as I'd like to think, but I'd rather have and not need it…*
He grabs his robe too, the stench of strill now gone after hanging to air out in the ship's recycled air. Ooru pulls it on slowly, mindful of his shoulder, and then dons his pack. He leaves the ship, headed for Lanius' quarters at a leisurely pace. As he walks the corridors he recalls the vision he had while unconscious.
*Could that be a side-effect of the Kinrath poison, or was it a genuine vision of the Force? Either way, Davian is in more trouble than I thought. Somebody doesn't want him found. Bad move on their part…*
He's nearly arrived when he remembers the glowrod he borrowed from Odan-Urr. He pulls out his comlink and sends a quick message out: "**Greetings Brother! I'm sure you've heard all about my little trip and I just thought I'd let you have your glowrod back - if you want it. I'm headed to see Lanius right now. Ooru out.**" His voice comes out more cheerful than he had intended, perhaps because he's happy to be on the move once again. That, and Odan helped him considerably in activities some might see as criminal in nature, and that always makes for a quick bond between acquaintences.
*I suppose we're about to find out how criminal those activities really were…*
Ooru reaches for the door panel to Lanius' quarters and raps lightly on the hatch before using the controls to announce his presence.

---

### **Alicia** (2012-01-03 17:19:10)

The door opens and Ooru is greeted by the sight of the elderly Draethos standing in the doorway. His head tilts in a greeting, but he turns to give a final word into the room. "**Think on what I’ve said, Lanius.**”
“**I will, Master, thank you.**” Lanius stands over by the table, the crate having been moved to the floor against the wall. In it’s place a teapot and a few cups reside in its place.
“**Ooru,**” Odan-Urr says passing him by on the way out the door. “**Don’t concern yourself with the glowrod. I have a feeling you might need it.**”
The door closes behind Ooru as he enters, Lanius motions his compatriot to join him and he pours a cup of the steaming brew into a clean cup and proffers it to Ooru. “**It’s been years since I’ve been under his tutelage and he still manages to make me feel like a youngling at times,**” Lanius says with a shake of his head. Nearly collapsing into his chair, he winces from the sudden discomfort, but hides it with a sip of his tea.
“**Now then, I believe we have some matters to attend to. I’ll try to help how I can, but there’s other matters I must attend to. For now you have my attention for the rest of the day.**” Taking another sip, he sets it down and leans back. “**Why don’t you start with the vision you had when you attempted to scry him?**”

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-03 17:43:46)

Ooru nods in gratitude to Odan-Urr as they pass each other and he takes a seat opposite Lanius. The tea is soothing on his dry throat. Savoring the silence, and comfortable repose, Ooru once again recounts his experience so far:
"**After Odan had directed me to one of the meditation chambers, I began to reach out with the Living Force - much as Davian himself taught me. At first there was nothing, just starlight. Then an overwhelming sense of despair and darkness. The last thing I saw before the light left was the asteroid field above us. Next I saw Davian, unconscious and surrounded by a fog. Whether it was an intentional interference or just a lack of my ability to reach him from some great distance, I couldn't tell. As we neared each other his body reacted somewhat violently, but the connection was severed before I could learn anymore.**"
The recollection is becoming almost second nature for Ooru, and his mind's eye re-lives the details as he speaks them. The process is made all the more bittersweet as he's wearing the robes given to him by the missing Master.
*And what do you make of these things, Master Lanius? Are you as heartless as you appear to be?*

---

### **Alicia** (2012-01-03 22:19:32)

Lanius patiently listens, and when it’s finished he leans his elbow on the edge of the table. For a long moment he seems lost in thought. “**Could you feel another presence with him? Do you think he was alone? If he was unconscious it’s doubtful he would have been able to sever the connection himself.**” Massaging his chin he considers the situation a bit longer.
“**It would seem a return to the asteroid field is in order. Hopefully from there we can pick up his trail.**” Standing he picks up the pot of tea and carries it over to a small kitchen area, pouring the remaining liquid into a thermos. “**My ship would be faster, if you don’t object?**” The master’s eyes raise in a question, but continues on. “**If we leave immediately we can be there in a few hours.**”

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-04 11:05:46)

The suggestion seems logical, and since Ooru is not as experienced at piloting, nor is he as familiar with the asteroid field, he agrees. His earlier judgments on Lanius' character may have been a little harsh.
*I suppose I'd be distant under such circumstances. We've all lost something here, perhaps Lanius the most…*
"**Sounds good to me. And Lanius - thanks. I know there's more going on here than I can see, and I appreciate the help. And…**" Ooru nearly forgot the obvious, "**…for saving my life.**"
As they embark on the short jaunt to Lanius' ship, Ooru shares his dream from the medbay. He speaks in quiet tones, not wanting to disturb any Kinrath in the caves. Leaning on his pikestaff helps the recovering Miralukan, loaded with his own medical supplies, keep up with the Master, and he begins:
"**There's something else too. I had a dream when I was unconscious from the Kinrath venom. I don't know if it's trustworthy but it was certainly vivid. Davian was inside of some sort of bubble or forcefield and when I reached out to touch it I was shocked by dark crimson light. My touch had left a hole in the bubble though, and I could see Davian clearly within. I think you're right about him being held against his will.**"

---

### **Alicia** (2012-01-04 16:23:33)

With Ooru ready, Lanius stuffs the thermos through his belt and takes a moment to check his equipment particularly a fusion lantern. Satisfied he motions for Ooru to head out the door ahead of him. “**Think nothing of it. Happy to help you get to the bottom of this. I just hope we can find Davian before he comes to any serious harm.**”
The jaunt is anything but short which Ooru quickly realizes as he leads them directly back into the dark reaches. Adjusting the brightness of the lantern as he walks, the cavern walls are soon illuminated by more than just the red over head lighting. Following the signs for the forest floor, Lanius doesn’t take them on any detours and there’s no sign of the Kinrath.
“**If these visions are coming from Davian, then it would indeed seem like he’s trapped. Unfortunately the Force doesn’t always give straight answer so we’ll just have hope we can handle it together.**” Taking a path away from the cave’s mouth, Lanius leads Ooru into the jungle and it’s not long till he can spot a clearing up ahead where a Dynamic-class ship, similar to the one Tonin let him borrow, is berthed. The ship isn’t in as fine condition as the *Star’s End* the freighter apparently having seen a great deal more action.
His pace never falters as he makes his way to the ramp, lowers it and boards. “**You can make use of the starboard bunk,**” he says pointing in that direction. “**I’d hang on though till we get out of the atmosphere, the ride can be a bit bumpy. I’ll give you a heads up when we’re close.**”
The bunk room is a standard affair, almost exactly the same as the Star's End featuring a couple bunks, crew storage, and a small refresher.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-04 17:18:25)

Ooru nods to Lanius and heads off to stow his gear in the room. He keeps the robe on though, and sits on the bunk, resting his back against the bulkhead. His pikestaff lays within reach but secure nearby. He waits for Lanius' signal that they've breached the planet's atmosphere, then responds:
"**Okay, thanks. I'm going to see if I can rest up just a bit before we arrive, if that's alright with you.**"
Ooru pulls his legs up and crosses them underneath his body, head bowed and arms resting lightly on his knees. Slowly he begins the meditation process to enter a Force trance as he learned at the Luka Sene so long ago.
*Not too many years have passed since I was there, but I feel like a completely different person now. The Brotherhood has been the family I never had. Davian and Tonin are like older brothers to me, not mentors or friends. I've discovered more about the Living Force - and myself - than I'd ever have been able to on Alpheridies. Of course, then I never would've met Vyrna…*
His thoughts drift to peace and the Living Force takes over Ooru's mind and body, working its mysterious ways on the young Miralukan. His unusual gift manifests itself much as when he was seeking Davian in the meditation chamber far below, and shadows begin to play and shift about the room. Forms of memories long since forgotten, vital life processes illustrated in semi-transparent shapes, and apparitions of those dear to his heart all pass silently through the dark room like ghosts as he rests.

### **Alicia** (2012-01-05 00:57:56)

Ooru’s thoughts twist and weave together till finally he finds his center and soon he realizes the sounds of the ship have changed. The hyperdrive engines have powered down and a strange silence has taken their place. Glancing at a chrono Ooru realizes he’s been in his trance for nearly six hours.
Making his way into the main part of the ship, he finds the common room’s lights to be dimmed. Lanius frowns over a holographic display of what seems to be a partial live feed of the asteroid field. The glow of the HoloFeed casts a ghostly shadow over his face as he looks through and spots the Miralukan. “**Morning. I hope you rested well.**” With an idle gesture he indicates the display.”**I’m afraid scans of the field have revealed very little, but that’s hardly surprising considering the interference. I have a feeling we’re not going to find him with scans alone. The Force has guided you this far, and I know of a technique which might be able to get you through the barrier placed around him.**” The holo image turns off and the room returns to it’s normal illumination. “**It’s not going to be without risks, but it may be our only choice short of sending for Tonin.**”

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-05 16:47:55)

Ooru wakes from his trance feeling refreshed from his encounter of the previous day. His shoulder is still sore, but the Living Force's curative abilities does wonders for the mind and body. Watching Lanius study the display for a moment, he listens to the suggestion with a sense of foreboding.
*No,* he thinks, *I won't succumb to fear. That's a dangerous path…*
"**Then I'm game. I've already updated Master Tonin once and I'd hate to contact him again without anything new to report. Even if this doesn't work it may lead us to other options.**"

Let the mettle-testing begin!

### **Alicia** (2012-01-07 15:40:02)

Lanius responds with a slow nod and steps away from the projector. “**If you think you’re centered then I think there’s no point in delaying.**” Moving into an open space of the common room he takes a seat on the ground, taking up a standard meditative pose. With a quick gesture he indicates Ooru should to the same across from him. “**This technique will combine our abilities serving to amplify your connection with Davian so we can find him. I can’t say what will happen, but from what I’ve researched we may experience glimpses into each other’s thoughts.**”
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

OK, so here it goes. Between the two of you, a goal of 175 needs to be made to be able to get a general direction of where Davian is. Getting higher than this will significantly increase the likelihood of finding him outright at the expense of gleaning more information from each other.
Making 5 rolls, you may use a combination of: Use the Force, Perception, Know: Life Sciences, Galactic Lore, CHA, and WIS. One must be an ability and you can only use 2 of theoptions twice.
Lanius was able to contribute: 117

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-07 17:45:26)

"**As centered as I'll ever be…**" Ooru says, moving to take up a position Lanius in the common room.
He breathes slowly and lets his mind empty of all conscious thought - much the opposite of when he had tried to find Davian on his own. Rather than focus on any one person or memory he instead relaxes and let's the Living Force do its work. His thoughts begin to drift into nothingness. It's not an easy endeavour, even having been taught so much by Davian himself about similar techniques, but if it's the only way then it has to be tried. A final fleeting thought does form, however, before being lost to the uncertainty of the technique:
*So many different methods and so many different failures, but I can't give up…*

### **Alicia** (2012-01-09 16:07:19)

A calm passes over the two Jedi as they both calm their minds and opening to the Force. An indistinguishable amount of time passes. Reaching out to touch Ooru’s mind, Lanius calm, focused presence finds him and their thoughts begin to merge. In his mind’s eye, Ooru finds himself in a white space floating across from Lanius. *Focus on Davian* Lanius says, and it’s hard to determine how the words come to Ooru.
Focusing on the task at hand, the whiteness changes to the black of space and ahead Ooru can see the shapes of the asteroids. Lanius floats just behind, following as the Miralukan follows the trail to his mentor and friend. At first it’s hard to sense Davian’s life force, and noticing Ooru’s difficulty Lanius places his hand on the younger man’s shoulder. A surge of energy seems to pass through them, along with a transfer of thoughs Ooru’s senses seem to sharpen. A light, almost like a beacon, shines out from the field.
*Sirens. Dimmed lights. The chaos of the dying ship are barely noteworthy as Lanius looks on the man he called Master. His friend. His mentor. Betrayer. Even as he laid pressed to the deck with his former apprentice’s lightsaber at his throat the man looks up with grim satisfaction. “**You’re weak, Lanius. You will never be able to do what needs to be done, and that will be your downfall!**” Lanius knows he is right as he kicks him into unconsciousness, unable to bring himself to make the final blow. He won’t go back. His life with the Jedi is over- Jedi Knight Lanius Mantell will die here.*
The exchange lasts for only a few moments and the mental image of Lanius shakes his head as he tries not to focus on the thoughts he gleans from Ooru. The light beckons them and it’s not long before the two travelers are dodging around the asteroids. Taking a great deal of concentration it’s only through the shared link that they are able to stay on course Ahead the sight of the small shuttle is a welcome one and seems to be the source of the glow, dimming as the two approach.
*Light from the nebula coalesces outside the small window in the converted quarters. Looking over Lanius can see Ka’ra watching the changes a sheet wrapped around her scarred body against the chill. A tinge of regret encompassed him as he realized soon he would have to leave the woman he had come to love. Sensing his dour mood, she turns to face him and he’s lost in her kiss.*
Suddenly the two are stopped painfully by a barrier just meters from the hull of the ship. The red bubble takes shape as it’s touched and meets resistance with a sharp mental jolt enough to leave but the strongest willed unconscious. *I think this is the closest we can come,* Lanius says, turning in place memorizing where they were.

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-09 16:59:35)

Once again searching for his Master and friend among the asteroid field, Ooru floats forward, guided by the Living Force towards Davian. The task seems overwhelming without Lanius' help and Ooru is grateful for the intensifed focus in the efforts. The shared memories are an unexpected side effect though, and after witnessing Lanius' first recollection he fights panic over what may be be revealed from his own past...<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

When Ooru fled the Luka Sene after discovering the Sith manuscripts, he continued to meditate on its ancient teachings. It's how he learned the Memory Walk power - an invocation steeped in anger and blind hate. During his second visit to Alpheridies where he and Vyrna were finally reunited, Ooru used the power for the first time ever. The meeting had been cordial at first - two childhood friends sharing what had transpired since Ooru's sudden departure years earlier. It wasn't long, though, before the two realized they shared more than just fond memories for each other. Had the campus-wide alarms not alerted them to the authorities' impending arrival, the bittersweet tale would have ended there - with Vyrna going on to become a successful cyberneticist and Ooru spending a great deal of the forseeable future explaining his more recent intellectual pursuits to the Sene Seekers. He managed to elude detection, however, and make it all the way to the nearest spaceport where he booked passage on an offworld transport to the Outer Rim. During his final moments on the planet a lone security officer attempted to hinder his departure. He'd heard the all points bulletin of someone fitting Ooru's description and was pretty confident he'd found the suspect. Unable to control the strong emotions already awoken because of his time with Vyrna, and overwhelmed at the prospect of being detained for his pursuit of forbidden knowledge, Ooru embraced the Dark Side fully for the first time. The guard begged for mercy before succumbing to all his worst fears realized at once.
*"**Leave. Me. ALONE!**" shouted Ooru, finally releasing the aging Miralukan from whatever terrors gripped him and fleeing into the waiting ship…*<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

Despite whatever might result from his own poor judgement, Ooru convinced himself to concentrate on the task at hand and not worry about the consequences of his own dark pursuits. The shuttle ahead is a promising sight and as they approach it the Force connection once more bleeds some of Ooru's past into Lanius' mind, though this time less dark. He hopes this revelation will put the first into a better perspective and allows the memory to become vision.<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

One of Ooru's only childhood friends was a fellow Luka Sene student - a Zeltron named Vyrna. The two were close in their younger years but during their recent reunion they both realized a growing fondness for one another. With Vyrna on the verge of becoming Alpheridies' lead cyberneticist, the relationship could easily prove ruinous. Love knows no bounds though - and the two have vowed to not stay apart for too long.
*"**Ooru, I don't care what they say - you know I trust you. We'll make it work somehow…**"*
The vision fades to the sound of a klaxon blaring and dark overtones - no doubt a foreshadowing of the events of the previous memory.<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

Ooru feels the now familiar sensation of being prevented from reaching Davian and waits for direction from Lanius about how to proceed.
*Do you think we can make it back here Lanius?*

---

### **Alicia** (2012-01-09 20:21:52)

*I believe so. At least we know he is still here and have a general direction. Come there’s nothing more we can do here.* Slowly Lanius begins to withdraw from the contact, the field fading until finally the two return to their physical state their bodies heavy and perhaps slightly exhausted from the mental excursion.
For a long while Lanius doesn’t move from his meditative pose on the cold deck. His eyes remain closed. He finally heaves a heavy sigh and stands slowly. “**Navigating the field is difficult and with the destruction of the base even more so. I hope you’ll be able to man the sensors?**” Making his way to the cockpit, Lanius takes his seat in the pilot’s chair and with the touch of several buttons the engines begin to power up.
It’s not long before the ship is moving toward the field at what seems like full speed, but with the excessive movements of the asteroids in the field it’s hard to tell. Lanius’s Jedi reflexes soon come into use as he heads deeper into the field, past the point of where Acheron once was. With Ooru ensuring the ships stays on course, Lanius is able to dodge the asteroids and make sure they’re heading in the right direction.
After what seems like hours, the ship reaches a clearing in the asteroid field and tucked away in its center is the shuttle. While scorched and pot-marked from what might be numerous collisions, the shuttle is still relatively intact, but looks adrift. Bring the freighter closer, Lanius lines up the ships to dock. “**Looks like everything but life support has been shut down over there.**” Lanius comments after checking the readouts.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-09 20:53:57)

The shuttle does indeed look derelict from a distance, and as Lanius moves his ship to dock that impression doesn't fade. Ooru glances at the summary systems scan display as well.
"**Well the good news is that means it's not going to try and run away or fire on us, right? And hopefully any security systems will be deactivated as well, but I'm not going to hold my breath. At least it's not more Kinrath…**" Ooru jokes, trying to lighten the mood before what will almost certainly be a dangerous forray into the unknown.
He takes a moment and reaches out with the Force one last time, hoping to gain any insight into what awaits them. Either way, he's as ready as he'll ever be to board the shuttle and finally rescue Davian - and remind his captor of the error of holding Ooru Okin's brothers against their will.

Nothing clear comes through to the Miralukan as he reaches out with the Force toward the ship. He can only sense a faint life force coming from within. Locking the controls, Lanius unstraps himself from his chair and proceeds to the airlock. He grabs a lantern from the cargo hold and tosses a vacuum mask from a compartment next to the airlock to Ooru taking two for himself. "**Just in case,**" he says, before turning his attention to the airlock's overrides. With a hiss, the airlock door opens and the light from the freighter's cargo hold spills out into the apparent living space of the Herald-class shuttles. Turning on the lantern, Lanius once again takes the lead.
The space on the ship is tight, and eerily quiet as the two make their way through the upper habitat level. In the cockpit, the duo are greeted by a grisly sight of two dead pilots, blood crusting their eyes, nose and ears. Turning away from the scene, Lanius waits for Ooru before heading toward the hatched ladder to take them to the lower deck into the cargo hold.

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-09 22:03:36)

Ooru catches the vacuum mask and draws back his hood to put it on. "**Just in case,**" he replies to Lanius with a wink.
*Again with the darkness…* thinks Ooru to himself as he follows Lanius through the airlock and into the waiting shuttle. He's grateful for the memento from his last encounter in the dark and gladly ignites his own glow rod - the one Odan-Urr had provided back on Telia V - for additional light. Upon spotting the dead bodies, he motions for Lanius to wait:
"**These are interesting wounds…**" Ooru examines the bodies carefully but quickly. "**And if the pilots are both dead, who flew the shuttle here?**"
Wisdom dictates caution in these circumstances and the young Miralukan is well aware of what falling in battle aboard the shuttle could mean. He grips his pikestaff tightly and leaves the corpses for the moment. The ladder hatch is closed at the moment and Ooru suddenly has an idea:
"**Lanius,**" he begins in a hushed voice, "**I have a thought. What if we open the hatch but I send an illusion of you down first? I can't sense anyone else onboard but whoever's holding Davian surely knows we're here. We've lost the element of surprise, maybe we can force their hand first?**"

**Knowledge (life sciences) +9** or **Treat Injury +10** (whichever you like) to examine the pilots' bodies for clues as to the cause of death. I'll roll for this one, just add +1 if you want the **Treat Injury** modifier:
***15*** <- [6] 1d20 + 9
And assuming Lanius is cool with it, I'll take ten to craft an illusion of Lanius to send down the ladder first. Of course we'll have to actually open it, but that's easy enough. It normally costs a FP to do that but I also have Force Harmony which I think covers that expenditure in this case.

From what Ooru can tell, the inside of their skull was put under extreme pressure until the pressure released any way they could.
Lanius nods and as Ooru begins to concentrate on his illusion of a very life-like Lanius he opens the hatch. Under Ooru's direction the phantasm proceeds down the ladder into the darkness. And... Nothing happens. Instead the illusion is greeted by a ghostly, echoing laughter. Lanius looks up in shock at Ooru, and he turns pale as he utters one word. "**Jut-hakk**"

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-09 23:05:15)

The sound echoes throughout the otherwise silent ship and Lanius' response confirms Ooru's suspicion: Jut-hakk was indeed present - or at least watching. Of course there was no indication that the rouse was working but there was only one way to find out. Not wanting to risk being overheard with the hatch already open, Ooru gestures to Lanius to stay put. If Jut-hakk saw through his illusion then it wouldn't be any loss and they may as well do away with stealth. If he hadn't though - having the real Lanius laying in wait could be their only advantage.
*No more dreams, no more visions, no more hiding. Now we end this…*
Ooru drops through the opening and lands in a low crouch beside the Lanius construct, igniting his saberpike as he stands slowly...
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I don't know your thoughts here, but I figure this is about right. Lanius may not agree but I don't think now's the time for conversation. Here's hoping it's not a bomb. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

​To Ooru's relief the emergency lighting is active in the cargo bay, the red lighting casting eerie shadows over the overcrowded bay. Crates and palates line the walls safe in their secured netting. The avatar of Lanius stands to the side looking around as it's lifelike illusion continues. The laughter had ceased as Ooru's feet hit the ground. Laying spread eagle in the middle of the bay is Davian, but as Ooru looks around there's no sign of Jut-hakk.

The scene was unexpected but not unwelcome. Ooru scans the area carefully from where he stands, his senses on high alert. Slowly he circles the body laying in the center of the deck. He motions for the illusion to circle as well, the two taking up flanking positions opposite each other.
*It's what I'd expect the real Lanius to do I suppose…*
He pauses to consider his next move. Surely this isn't the real Davian - it wouldn't be *that* easy. It could be that Jut-hakk is using an illusion of his own, or it could be this is indeed the real Davian but *trapped* somehow. Then again the crates would provide decent cover for an ambush. He's been persistent this far, he may as well keep on going...
"**Lanius,**" he whispers to the illusion, "**I'll take a look at Davian, you watch my back.**"
Ooru leans in close to the body, feigning concern over caution while he steers his construct in the direction of the crates.

Taking the cue, the construct moves in the indicated direction making a circuit of the crates in a false attempt to get a look around. Even as Ooru casually does the same, he doesn't notice anything out of sorts.
Without any warning, Davian's body heaves in a gulp of air and he coughs. Rolling onto his side for a long moment he seems to gasp for the air his body had been denied in it's near comatose state. He looks up and spots Ooru hovering over him. Reaching out Davian grabs the front of the Miralukan's robe as if reassuring himself Ooru was in fact real. "**Ooru, by the Force. I've been having the strangest dream.**"

---

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-10 11:28:29)

Startled by the sudden reaction, Ooru pulls back at first but then carefully crouches down to meet Davian at eye-level.
"**That's because these are strange times, Master. It's good to see you - are you well enough to walk?**"
*I still don't believe it'll be this easy…*
Ooru does his best to stay alert while diverting the necessary attention to Davian. He's hesitant to call for Lanius until any trap has been sprung but maybe it's just paranoia . There was the laughter, and getting here wasn't a cake walk. It would be folly to let down one's guard so near to their goal...

**Use the Force +15** to *search your feelings* vs. DC15 to decide whether summoning the real Lanius to come down will be better than keeping up the rouse. I'd like to take **take 10** if possible, just because I'm really afraid of rolling a one, but I'll roll too, just in case:

Also - I think I'd try and suck us out into space by opening the cargo bay door as part of the trap, but that's just me.

Davian, having finally recovered, uses Ooru as support as he gets into a sitting position. “**I think so.**” Even though he threatens to keel over again as the blood begins to rush to his head. Squinting in the dim light he finally notices the apparition. “**What is he doing here?**”
Ooru isn’t sure if it’s Davian’s reaction, instinct, or his connection with the Force, but he realizes bringing Lanius down might not be such a good idea. However, the decision is out of his hands as Lanius jumps down into the hold, his lightsaber in hand but unlit.
“**I thought I heard you call for help,**” he says glancing between Davian and Ooru, slightly confused.His last word is cut off as Lanius is slammed into a crate, suspended above the floor. The master drops his lightsaber as he futilely attempts to pull off what ever is holding him by the throat. A low, strange laughter follows emanating from Davian. “**Nice of you to finally join us, Lanius,**” the young man says, standing up to his full height, his condition apparently no longer perturbing him. Casting a glance over at the Miralukan he adds, “**Thank-you for bringing my betrayer here.**”

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-10 17:03:32)

*Well there's a big surprise…*
Ooru knows this could still be Jut-hakk using Davian's real body somehow, but it was a risk he had to take. Lanius wasn't going to be much help at the moment and if anyone was going to get hurt it couldn't be him. His skill at combat was superior to Ooru's - the Kinrath encounter had shown that - and his training in the Living Force was almost certainly better as well.
*No,* thinks Ooru, *I have to chance it…*
"**You're welcome, anything I can do to help. By the way-**" replies Ooru sarcastically, motioning with open hand and emptying his strength into an attempt to smash "Davian" with a crate of his own, "**-*where's Davian?***"
His last words betray a growing impatience that even he hadn't realized was present

The crate comes flying through the air, released from its straps by the ferocity of Ooru’s will. The apparition of Lanius disappears as the crate passes through him and into the unsuspecting Davian. The force of the impact pushes Davian away and he’s pushed to the ground as the crate essentially runs him over.
Lanius drops to the floor, coughing and gasping for air, but released from the grip Davian had over him. Kneeling, he looks up at Ooru and then over to Davian in concern.
“**You’re only hurting Davian, Ooru.. Or at least what’s left of him,**” Davian says, collecting himself from off the floor. “**Don’t worry. He’s still here.**” With a tap of his head, he adds, “**Somewhere.**” The impact has torn his clothing in several places and from the way he’s moving several ribs and other bones have been broken. The pain doesn’t seem to be affecting him. “**I’ll give you a choice, Ooru. Join me.. or die with him.**” The last part is accentuated as Davian draws on the Force once more, but this time an arc of blue lightning spews out of his hand at the Master as he struggles to get to his feet. “**Of course… I’ll spare you, Lanius, if you tell me where you’ve taken it.**”
Through cleanched teeth a weak “**Never!**” can be heard from Lanius as he writhes in pain from the electrical current.

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-10 21:24:53)

Ooru had hoped Jut-hakk was just using some sort of disguise, but apparently this was, indeed, Davian's body - and mind, if Lanius was right.
*A choice?* thinks Ooru, watching Lanius tormented by Jut-hakk/Davian's attack, *I'm not here for that…I'm not here for Jut-hakk or Lanius, I'm here for Davian…the other two are - were - respected Masters in the Brotherhood and I owe them a measure of both honor and allegiance, but they aren't the reason I've traveled halfway across the galaxy…I don't care about a Force Harvester right now, I only care about my friend…someone who's become more than just a mentor to me, more than just a Brother…I have to save Davian, the rest is secondary…*
Ooru considers how best to acheive his goal for a few moments before responding to Davian/Jut-hakk.
*I would rather face a hundred Kinrath vipers in the dark than do what I'm about to do, but I'm out of options - and patience…*
Finally deciding on a course of action, he begins to meander to the controls to the loading doors. He does his best to appear to be wrestling with the decision - deactivating his pikestaff and looking generally conflicted - while at the same time finding a good handhold.
*Any longer and Lanius will be done for. Of course, that may be a preferable death to what I'm about to do…*
"**I'm flattered, *Master Jut-hakk*, to have been given such a choice - but I have one for you: Stop what you're doing right now and leave Davian alone or suck vacuum. I haven't come this far to lose him because you two can't decide who should destroy the galaxy with some fancy relic. Lanius might survive, I *definitely* will - but you're not wearing one of *these* at all…**" Ooru taps his vacuum mask with his free hand, "**…and it's awfully cold out there…**" He motions towards the loading doors.
"**Bottom line: you're messing with my friend. I'll watch him die a painful, agonizing death before I let you take him.**"

Davian turns his attention to Ooru as he moves about the cargo hold. The lightening recedes and the only light is from Ooru’s glow rod and the red emergency lighting. Lanius lays still on the deck, but he lets out a small moan with each breath.
“**You can kill my host, but you can’t kill me. Open the hatch if you wish to lose your friend. I will find you, and ….**” Davian’s body gaspsBehind him, Lanius is laying on his side, a deep look of intense, pained concentration on his face. Falling to his knees it’s only another seemingly long moment before Davian’s eyes roll back.
There’s a maniacal laugh, and an apparition forms hovering over the beaten body. “**You will regret crossing me, Ooru Okin.**” The last words fade as the apparition disappears only to reappear to hover next to Lanius. Lanius is attempting to get up and has made it to a position on his hands and kness. The spirit whispers something to him and the injured Master’s eyes go wide as he looks onto the faded form of Master Jut-hakk. “**Tell me and I’ll leave them alone,**” Ooru can hear Jut-hakk saying. “**You may not value your life, but what about theirs?**”

Ooru listens silently, his hand hovering over the control panel, his eyes boring into Jut-hakk/Davian's. He isn't about to kill his beloved Master for the sake of an idle threat but he can't let Jut-hakk have the upper hand. He watches the body crumple to the floor as the ghostly form emerges at last.
"**I'm already regretting it - that laugh is *really* annoying…**" he mutters in response to Jut-hakk's ominous words.
Ooru waits for the spectre to fade before rushing to Davian's side, draping his own robe over the unconscious Master to try and help at least a little from the onset of shock. The breathing is shallow and labored - due in part to Ooru's earlier attack. Reaching out with Living Force he let's it flow through and from him, attempting to place Davian's broken frame into a Force Trance - yet another technique he had learned from Davian himself. He hears Jut-hakk speaking to Lanius again and watches the interaction.
*Lanius isn't doing so well either…better think of something fast…*
"**Hey Jut-hakk,**" he shouts, hoping to embolden Lanius as much as frustrate the Zabrak phantasm's efforts, "**if you're done giving up now, I need Lanius' help over here…**"

Ooru’s bravado earns him a glare from the spirit, but the distraction is enough for Jut-hakk to lose his momentum with Lanius. Quickly realizing this battle was lost, the spirit begins to dematerialize. “**Until next time.**” The expression on the old Master’s face does indeed promise another encounter, one that may not be as readily won.
Heaving himself up to his feet, Lanius takes a moment to make sure he’s steady before moving toward Ooru and the unconscious Davian. Having successfully put the injured man into a trance, Davian’s breathing is near non-existent. Anyone who wasn’t trained in such arts might have already declared him dead. “**We should get him back to Telia,**” Lanius says, helping Ooru to pull out the collapsible hover stretcher from the medical kit and strapping Davian onto it.
With it’s aid it’s only a slightly tricky process to get Davian up the ladder. Before Lanius follows up, he casts a glance around the seemingly empty cargo hold, his brow creased.

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-13 13:23:39)

Ooru steers the stretcher past the deceased pilots before realizing Lanius is falling behind.
"**He's gone Lanius… you all set? I can stabalize Davian but some of these wounds are beyond my skill to heal.**"
Waiting for Lanius' reply gives Ooru cause to re-assess what had just happened. How close had he come to killing his friend and Master - and would he really have been able to do it? And what did Jut-hakk mean 'Until next time,'? He fixes the robes wrapped around Davian and lets his eyes come to rest on the dead bodies only a few meters away.
*And how many are going to die before this is over?*

Lanius finally falls in behind Ooru, letting him lead the way toward the ship. The Master's movements are pained and as the full extend of the freighter's light hits him, Ooru can see the effects the Force Lightning had on the man's body. Burns and blisters cover the exposed portions of his flesh and it's only conceivable that the same could be found under his robes. Closing the boarding ramp behind them, he starts heading for the cockpit. "**Get Davian strapped in. Things are going to get rough.**" His words are emphasized by the sounds of proximity alarms going off in the cockpit.
Davian is looking slightly better after Ooru's medical ministrations, his ribs and other broken bones wrapped and splinted, but being in the Healing Trance he is still in a comatose state. Thankfully it seems to be accelerating the man's healing.

### **BWS2K** (2012-02-16 21:34:32)

The irony of having to stabilize his friend largely because of his own foolish behavior is not lost on Ooru but he tries hard to look past the sting of his own failings and focus on the present. He takes his time securing Davian, allowing Lanius some distance. A few tense moments pass and Ooru breaks the silence:
"**Sorry about what happened back there. For my part, I really wasn't convinced things were what they seemed.**" He lets the apology hang between them before continuing, strapping himself into the nearest seat. "**Are you going to be alright, Lanius? I can take a look at those burns…**"
