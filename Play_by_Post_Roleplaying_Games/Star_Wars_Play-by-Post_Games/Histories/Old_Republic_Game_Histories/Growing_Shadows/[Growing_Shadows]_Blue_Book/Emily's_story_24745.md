Emily awoke in the dark, like she went to sleep. She reaches over and turns on a small lantern to illuminate her resting place. The harsh light of the lantern illuminates what could probably be best described as a nest of blankets, in what is clearly a ventilation system. She tries to remember which station she is on at the moment there having been so many of them lately, after a moments thought she remembers it's the Stenness Hyperspace Terminal.
As she rubs the remains of sleep from her eyes, her stomach decides to remind her that it's been quite awhile since the last time she ate. She switches out the clothes from those she slept in, into a nice clean white dress, nothing like what you would expect a thief to be wearing.
Once she is dressed, she reaches out to lift up the lantern and and starts to make her way through the ventilation system heading for one of the market areas of station with the intent of acquiring some food, although without a firm plan on how exactly she is going to do it.
It doesn't take her very long to navigate her way through the ventilation system, her long practice traveling through such systems, and her couple of previous trips though this specific system allow her to traverse it without getting lost in the maze of tunnels.
Once she reaches the market entrance that she plans to use she turns off her little lantern putting it to the side of the entrance where she will be able to find it easily later, and slips out of the ventilation system as quietly as she can manage, walking quietly as she slips into the market, and blending in with the crowd, as she steps into the busy market.

Various merchants wander the halls of the market, showing their wares to the travelers passing through. "**Morning little lady, care for some flemal juice?**" one asks as you pass him by, extending a small bottle of the juice out for your inspection. "**Will put you in high spirits.**" He adds as you walk past.
The market is just going into full swing as travelers wake from their slumber to investigate the pleasures the station has to offer. Many of them keep a close watch on their pockets, fully aware this place is ripe full of pickpockets and criminals. Those few you find not watching their pockets become easy marks as you try your luck. Unfortunately enough it seems you weren't the only one to have found them easy pickings. Only scrapping a couple credits off those unlucky souls you discover you're going to have to go after some of the more difficult targets.

Emily turns down the drink with a smile, saying **"No thanks."** to the merchant offering it to her before she moves on to work the crowd. After she has picked the first few pockets with very little to show for it she heads a little bit out of sight so that she can safely count the few credits she has managed to gather so far and sighs, seems like this isn't going to be an easy day.
She looks around before putting the credits back in her pocket and heads back into the crowd, looking for a very specific kind of target this time. Someone that looks like they would have sufficient credits to be worth the risk of robbing, but dangerous enough that most pickpockets would steer well clear of them.
She smiles as she walks through the crowd thinking of the food that she will soon be enjoying with the money she is going to acquire, content to daydream a little while she is still looking for a target since she is going to need her full concentration once she has found them if she wants to pulls this off.

There's an assortment of spacers who have taken this time to catch some R&R. You look over the more heavily armed visitors and begin to focus on those wearing the expensive attire, but still have that dangerous edge to them.
That's when you notices one figure making her way through the crowd, stopping occasionally to look at the wares at one stand or another. The armor itself looks new, or at least well cared for, with no visible dings on its surface. The blue-black of the paint and the close fit to the woman's form indicates a custom job. Around her waist is utility belt with a arrangement of pouches and strapped to her left hip, a heavy blaster pistol.
The woman stops at one stand in particular and draws out a slim credit chip from a side pouch handing it to the vendor in exchange for a jar of some exotic spices. Putting the jar into a cloth bag she has slung over her shoulder she resumes her trek through the market.

Emily examines the women as discretely as possible, while she buys the spice, trying to get a feel for whether she is a likely target or not. She follows after the woman after she has made her purchase, attempting to intercept her before she gets too far from the store in order to maximise the time she will have before the woman will notice her credit chips are missing.
She slips up behind the woman, still considering which approach would be best right up until the last possible moment, and decides to go for the pretty classical bumping into the armoured woman, as she makes the lift, and and smiles up at the armoured woman and starts with the obligatory apology, in her most child-like tone "I'm sorry."
