Description <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Tanith is 29 years old, 1.6 meters tall, and weighs 60 kilos. His dark hair is starting to grey at the temples, and his brown eyes are troubled- betraying the things he’s seen and the depth of his thoughts. Beneath his armor, his body is a wiry and scarred testament to the wars he’s seen. His armor is patched, faded, and well worn, as are his pistols. His helmet is more flexible leather than plasteel, with a face mask containing the life support and high tech goggles. He owns a used L.I. AeroChaser speeder bike, as beaten and patched as his armor.

</details>

Personality <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Tanith is an idealist who has been tempered by experience and war. He believes in the Republic, but not its government or its Jedi protectors. He goes to great lengths to enjoy himself, hoping to avoid the torturous thoughts and memories brought on by boredom.

</details>

Background <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

At the age of eighteen Tanith Hoagra joined the Republic Army in response to the call for forces to fight in the Mandalorian Wars. He served as a technician, working as a mechanic and engineer. He learned a great deal from a brilliant Zabrak named Bao-Dur while serving under the Jedi general who became the Exile. This was where he lost his faith in the Jedi. The General’s order to activate the Mass Shadow Generator killed as many of her own troops as it did Mandalorians. Tanith could see that it had affected her, she seemed half dead afterwards. Rumors on the ship said she had lost the Force. Later he learned she had been exiled by the Jedi Council. That she had returned to face their judgment was her only redeeming trait in Tanith’s eyes.
After the Mandalorian Wars and Malachor V, he saw the war in a different light. He saw the way Jedi leaders had thrown troops away because they didn’t understand tactics. He began to understand most of their losses could be laid at the feet of their commanders. The disaster at Serroco was an example. What the Mandalorians did was reprehensible, but whatever fool had made the decision to barrack the Republic forces in the civilian centers was equally to blame. With his faith the Republic government and Jedi shattered, he left the Army.
When the newly christened Darth Revan made his presence known by attacking the Republic, Tanith felt even more betrayed and confused. His love of the Republic’s people made him join the Navy, and Revan’s betrayal served to deepen his distrust of Jedi. While he agreed with the Sith’s intentions, he saw war as unnecessary and needless. He flew in several battles as a fighter pilot. After the Battle of Rakata Prime, Tanith learned of Revan’s role in the final months of the war. Tanith couldn’t understand why the man was never brought up on charges. Only his status as a Jedi prevented it, which troubled Tanith greatly. His disgust with the Republic’s favoritism of Jedi and the Jedi’s wars ravaging the galaxy he loved drove him to abandon the Navy.
After leaving the military he made his way through the galaxy earning his keep as a pilot, mercenary, and racer. He found he was too scrupulous to maintain regular employment as a mercenary, not taking contracts that contradicted with his conscious. The same went for the piloting jobs he had found. He wouldn’t transport slaves or weapons, and didn’t care much for smuggling, save for things he considered harmless. He supplemented his income with bodyguard work, his mechanic skills, and swoop racing. He couldn’t afford a drag bike, but his used L.I. AeroChaser was great for round track races. He had more or less settled on Nar Shadda, having befriended a Duros innkeeper named Lai Teebo. Lai provided him a room and meals for free in exchange for Tanith acting as a bouncer when things became rough. Lai also kept him informed on lucrative jobs, as well as providing a pipeline to the black market, mostly chop-shops and smugglers. An old friend from the wars has also set up on Nar Shadda: a Herglic weapons dealer named Stavros Udo. He met the massive weapons and armor smith as Stavros travelled the frontlines and ships, plying his wares to Republic soldiers. Stavros has used Tanith on many supply and buying runs, and to keep his ship in good repair. In return, he offers fair prices and easily accessible wares Tanith would otherwise have trouble finding, as well as storage for Tanith’s bike when off-planet.

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-06 17:30:02)

Tanith rolls over in the late evening gloom of his room above Lai Teebo's bar, happy he was still in the Duros's good graces. He groans as he stands, old wounds and last night's binge taking their toll.
*Never again will accept a drinking challenge from a frakking Wookie,* he thinks as he pulls on his armor. He looks back at the sleeping Twi'lek female; Ooija, one of Lai's waitresses, and decides to let her sleep. He looks over his badly mauled credit stock and wonders how long he'll stay in Lai's good graces.
*Time to find some work, or maybe a race. Wonder if Lai's around?* he ponders as he makes his way downstairs to the bar proper: The Wayfarer's Rest.

<div style="text-align: right;">
![File](http://docs.google.com/File?id=dcc9z729_39dgbxmzrt_b)
</div>

The cantina is relatively quiet given the time of day. Still early yet, only the most dedicated of patrons have arrived, or possibly had never left. The cantina is homely enough run by the female Duros, Lai Teebo, as a dual cantina and lodge. She only has a few rooms she has rented out, but considering the locale, the price is fair for the state of the rooms, which are under decent repair. Business has been good for Lai which has put her in a better mood than usual.
The Duros woman stands behind her bar, cleaning the counter as she speaks to an armored woman. The black-blue armor is unusual even from the vantage you have of it. Obviously not made from the usual stock, you have a hard time placing the manufacturer, but it seems to be light armor. Standing a hair under five and a half feet, she wears the form fitting armor well. There's a blaster rifle slung across her back and a heavy blaster pistol holstered at her right hip in easy reach.
Lai seems to be questioning the armored woman and then upon seeing you, motions her head in your direction before going about other work. Turning to face you, you're struck by the familiarity of it. As she looks at you from the T-visor you are reminded of the helmets worn by the Mandolorians during the war. While the helmet itself is a different shape and style, the T-visor is the most recognizable feature.
Approaching, she seems to look you up and down in an evaluation. "**Hoagra? Tanith Hoagra?**" she asks, in her accented lilt upon getting within a few feet. Her voice comes in through amplified by the speakers wired through her helmet.

*Mandalorian. No one else wears visors like that. Different armor design, new or this one never was issued the other,* Tanith thinks as the woman approaches. *I hope Lai didn't just sell me out to a vengeful war vet.*
**"Su cuy'gar,"** Tanith says, unsure of the pronunciation, **"Did I say it properly, Mandalorian? Yes I am Tanith Hoagra. What do you need?"** he asks as he sits down at the bar, nodding to the stool next to him and motioning for Lai or the droid bartender. He throws his helmet onto the bar and runs a hand through his military short hair and over his face, wondering how bad he looked this morning.

### **Alicia** (2010-07-07 07:52:43)

The woman gives a light laugh as she moves to sit at the bar beside you. You're not sure how she does it, but she takes the stool with the graceful movements of a dancer. "**Su cuy'gar, I am Ka'ra,**" she says with a slight bow of her head in greeting. As one of the bartenders approaches, depositing a cup of caf in front of you, Ka'ra motions him away without ordering. "**A mutual friend of ours has pointed you in my direction. I'm in need of a pilot for a ship I've recently come into.**" The woman continues to watch you, having never removed her gaze from your direction since she first spotted you. "**She claims you were one of the best she had seen during the war.**"

## Re: [Growing Shadows - Blue Book] Tanith Hoagra's story

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-07 19:08:42)

Tanith cradles the caf as he would like to cradle his head and says, **"Good to meet you Ka'ra. Since old Momma Lai is the only pilot around that I acknowledge as my better, she must be who you're talking about."**
He sips the caf slowly, enjoying the harsh bitterness and warmth. He can already feel life beginning to flow back into his tired bones. *They say war ages a man like nothing else except women, but damnit I shouldn't feel this old. Not yet,* he thinks.
**"Piloting eh? So long as you didn't steal it from the wrong people or buy it for the wrong people you've got yourself a pilot. Where's she to be delivered?"** he asks as he scans the bar for Ooima, Ooija's sister, so that he can remind her too not let her sister sleep late. Lai's good graces did not extend to corrupting her servers.

### **Alicia** (2010-07-07 19:30:27)

"**Lai?**" Ka'ra asks quisically. "**Oh, your landlady. I was actually referring to Niandra Prius. She told me the two of you served together during the last conflict. I needed someone I could trust for the job.**"
Niandra Prius was one of your fellow pilots you flew with during the Jedi Civil War, months before the end of the war she had been promoted to squadron leader. You recall she was on the fast track of becoming an officer in the navy. An excellent pilot herself, she seemed to like giving orders, which she was good at, more than flying. In the cockpit she could raise hell but outside it she could be downright calm.
"**I came by the ship through family.**" Ka'ra gives a small laugh at the apparent idea of having stolen the ship and then grows serious again. "**It's a standing contract, with minimal terms, but it will last for as long as you want the work.**" Standing she makes as to leave. "**It's at landing pad 4 in the Corellian Sector. I would like to leave within the day so if you're interested be sure you're ready.**"

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-07 19:45:51)

**"Hold a moment, now lass,"** Tanith stammers out seeing her move to leave, **"I'll need a bit more than that to go on. Lets hear the terms and rate, I may join you with a few hours, if they are to my liking."**
*Niandra Prius, I haven't seen her since the Battle of Rakata Prime. How did a Mandalorian become friends with an officer on a fast track to Captain? What am I getting myself into? What has Niandra gotten herself into?*

---

## Re: [Growing Shadows - Blue Book] Tanith Hoagra's story

### **Alicia** (2010-07-07 20:30:16)

The armored woman adjusts the rifle over her shoulder as she considers you once more. "**Your living expenses while you reside on the ship will be covered plus 800 a month. Depending on jobs a bonus will be provided, but upkeep on the ship and my fighter will come first. Anything left over we will split seventy - thirty. My terms are simple. Keep the ship and yourself ready till you're needed.**"
She waits to see if you have any further questions, but she seems to be of the opinion that everything has been laid out.

**"Merc work? Do-able. I'm also handy with a hydro-spanner and these pistols aren't for show… Make it a thousand per month, in advance, and an option to renegotiate every six months, and you have yourself a pilot,"** he replies, thinking this could go along way towards his own ship and helping out Momma Lai.
*Need to stop by Stavros's and pick up a few things and drop off the bike… wait,* **"Will a swoop be of any use? I own one that can be pressed into service,"** he states.

Ka'ra seems to consider the price. "**1000 a month then.**" She reaches into one of the pouches on her belt and then sets a chip on the bar's counter. "**Here's 500 to get your affairs in order the rest I'll have once you reach the ship.There's room for your bike, but you'll have to handle the maintenance of it.**"

**"Done and done. See you there in a few,"** Tanith replies with a mild grin as he takes the chip.
He rushes to Momma Lai and grabs her up in a hug, **"Back in the saddle Momma! Credits and the stars!"** he exclaims before gently putting her down, happy to be working again, **"I'll bring you back something nice, and Ooija is asleep, tell her good by for me?"**
While waiting for her response he activates his comm and keys up Stavros, holding his helmet up towards his face waiting for the big Herglic to pick up...

Ka'ra makes her way confidently out of the cantina, leaving you to finish your business.
Lai pats you on the back as you pick her up in the hug. "**Good, I been growing tired of yar belly aching. Getting out of here will do ya some good.**" As you set her down she goes back to cleaning the counter. "**Don'tcha worry about Ooija. Things will be fine here.**" She walks away, humming and cleaning.
It takes only a few moments for the comm to be answered by the Herglic. "**Udo Munitions. Stravos…speak**," comes the gruff voice.

I'll fill you in when I get there."**
Tanith pulls on the helmet while listening and heads for the garage area behind the bar. Once there he mounts his speeder bike and makes the best time he can on the way to Udo Munitions, stopping along the way to pick up some of Stavros's favorite Ryl spiked cigars....

## Re: [Growing Shadows - Blue Book] Tanith Hoagra's story

### **Alicia** (2010-07-08 03:16:42)

After handing the cashier 10 credits for the cigars you make your way to the building the herglic uses to manage his business. More of a warehouse, he uses is it as the central location of business for the more lucrative and potentially unsavory transactions. You know he has a number of smaller buildings where he has other goods stored for any given amount of time.
Before you can get to the Herglic you have to go through the process of checking in with his checkpoint guards, bouncers really by the looks of them. The process is quick and soon you've made it into the warehouse proper. With the tall ceilings and expansive surroundings it's no wonder why Stravos prefers this building to any other on Nar Shadaa. Expecting you, he approaches from around a stack crates he was inspecting.
"**Tanith, come, come. I think I have what ya wanted.**" There's a haum as air escapes his blow hole and motions for you to follow before taking you to his office. "**There aren't many of these left. The company went out of business years ago, but I was able to track down some left overs.**" He motions for you to head into his office first, watching the activity on the warehouse floor while you pass him. The herglic's office is little more of a place for him to store and pile the papers created by his business. A droid, an obviously new addition to the franchise, is slowly making progress in sorting the papers scattered through out the room.
Before the droid can utter an exclamation, Stravos points to the door. "Find out if they've pulled down crate B-14598."
With an utterance of "Yes, Master Stravos." It moves as quickly as it dares out into the warehouse proper. As the droid disappears out of the office the herglic entrapenuer turns back to Tanith and after a haum asks, "**What's this new 'lucrative' job you have found yourself?**"

**"Hear ya go, Stavi,"** Tanith replies as he enters the office, tossing the Herglic the cigars, minus one. **"To celebrate new work, eh?"**
After lighting his cigar he finds a seat or reasonable facsimile in the clutter and answers, **"Younger Mando lass, unless my guess is way off, just offered me a running contract to fly and gun with her. Decent introductory price with option to renegotiate later, plus expenses and the occasional bonus. Any excess is split seventy-thirty, though I may be able to up my cut later."** He enjoys the cigar as he explains. He loved the things, but they made his chest ache for a day or two, so he rarely ever joined the Herglic. *Wonder if I've made up for my gaff earlier?*
**"I've decided to take the bike with me, so it won't be cluttering up your warehouse this time, my friend. Can you think of anything I may need out there that you can spare? I can transfer you about half the credits for the shield after I reach the ship."**

The Herglic takes one of the diminutive cigar into his hand, where it seems to disappear. Holding it more like a cigarette he goes about carefully lighting it and the celebrating your apparent fortune. "**Sounds like ya've hit the jack pot, provided she doesn't get ya killed first. Especially the young ones. Out to prove themselves, more inclined to take risks.**" He says as he puffs at the cigarette, some of the smoke blowing out from his blowhole. "**Who is this prodigal employer of yars?**"
He seems to take your other question and mull over it as he listens to your answer.

**"Ka'ra. No parental name given. Don't remember much Mando'a, think it's astral. Anyway, she know Niandra. You remember Niandra Prius, don't you Stavi?"** Tanith asks. **"If she gets me killed I won't have to worry about my debts. Guess that means its in your best interest to send me well equipped eh?"** he chuckles.
*Stavros has a point, as always. If I die, who will look after Momma Lai? Speaking of which…*
**"Stavi, will you drop in on Momma Lai once in a while? I worry about her sometimes,"** he asks suddenly sobered by the wise Herglic's words. **"Maybe have a goon wander over late nights? Keep the peace? You can bill me for it. I've got no choice but to take the contract. The potential payout is too high and I don't know if I could stand another week on this rock."**

### **Alicia** (2010-07-08 18:09:38)

The herglic looks thoughtful as he takes in the name "**Ka'ra… yes.**" Taking another puff he thinks some more. "**Yes, yes Ka'ra Bralor. She was quite well known around here a year or so ago. Making quite a name for herself, I must say.**" He pauses clearing his blowhole of smoke. "**Then she just up and disappears. Most thought someone had taken her out. Though, if she's a friend of Niandra's how bad could she be?**" Stavros finishes the cigar, extinguishing it in a tray he keeps on his desk.
The droid reenters the office a worker in tow carrying a small crate. After he deposits it on top of the desk the worker gives a nod to Stavros and then to you before leaving. The droid on the other hand gets back to work picking up and sorting the papers.
Heading toward the crate, Stavros adds, "**Don't ya worry about Lai. I'll make sure the rough necks stay clear. Now, let's see what we have.**" The crate has obviously been in storage for some time considering the film of dust the Herglic removes with a swipe of his hand. Entering a code the crate unlocks and he pulls out the shield device.
"**Finicky things. Looks like this one will need a bit of maintenance to get working right. It was one of the newer designs which never saw full use after the war. Should be able to recharge it, but it will break easier and keeps fewer charges.**" Handling it delicately he looks it over before passing it over to you. "**As for other equipment, unless ya have need for an armor or weapons upgrade not sure what else I can help ya with.**"
(( The shield (SR 10) works as normal, except only has two charges before needing to be recharged by an external power source. Currently being nonfunctional you will need to spend some time fixing it. Please remember that even though you are proficient in light armor, you still take armor check penalties with the shield activated. Takes one charge per encounter (usable only once per encounter and cannot be recharged like vehicle ships mid-combat) and is only effective against energy damage.
I have been considering changing how mixed damage type is handled (ie. energy and slashing). Making it so half the damage is counted against the shield and half goes through it, but we will see how the normal rules work with the full damage taken by the shield. ))

**"Thanks, Stavi. I appreciate it. Rechargeable, eh? How badly is this gonna impact my credit?"** Tanith asks, overawed at the find and fearful he would be in debt to the Herglic for the rest of his life.
**"As for better weapons and armor, you know I'm always on the look out for 'em, but they get damned expensive Stavi and I'd rather not take advantage. You've a business to run. Maybe after I've pulled a bonus or two out of this contract and paid you back, okay?"** he tells his friend, knowing full well gear better than what he has is incredibly hard to come by. He stands and extinguishes his cigar early, his chest already feels afire.
**"As for Miss Bralor, what kind of work was she know for here? Who did she work with?"** he asks. **"Beyond that I'd guess I might as well head out Stavi. Thanks again,"** he says with a vigorous pat to the Herglic's shoulder before collecting his bike and leaving to meet Ka'ra at landing pad 4 in the Corellian Sector.

With a wave of his hand, Stavros insists that Tanith not think about it. "**We'll call it the normal price. This thing has been collecting dust for years. Will be nice to get it out of here.**" He pulls out another of the stogies from the carton, igniting it, he puffs at it again. "**I'll let ya know if I get anything that might interest ya.**" After another puff adds, "**Or yar new boss. Ya'll need new toys to keep up with her. Bralor was notorious for going after targets and bringing them in intact.**" There's a haum and expansive amount of cigar smoke. "**Don'tcha worry about Lai,**" he says walking you to the door. "**Keep in touch now.**" He stands outside with you only so far as to give you a wave of his hand in goodbye before heading back in through the massive cargo doors.
The trip to the Corellian sector doesn't take long, though the stop at the checkpoint lasts far longer as you wait in line to get entrance. Apparently they've been getting tough on security in an attempt to cut down on crime. Who knows how long that will last?
Having apparently landed on the outskirts of the sector, Ka'ra managed to find a reasonably secluded landing pad while still managing to keep her ship secure. You are greeted by the sight of a Citadel-class cruiser, kept in what seems to be spectacular repair. Attached to the cruiser is a fighter, the design is nothing you have ever seen before. Ka'ra stands next to the fighter a tool box laid out beside her as she continues what seems to be some ongoing repair work on the fighter's attached hyperdrive sled.<div style="text-align: right;">

Tanith kills the thrusters on his bike, letting it ease forward on momentum and repulsers. As he coasts to a stop near the Citadel he whistles in appreciation, **"I'm to fly that beauty? Lass, you may find yourself with a proposal instead of just a pilot. What are you working on there? What model is that fighter? Never seen one before."**
He dismounts and wanders around both ships, taking in as much as he can.

### **Alicia** (2010-07-09 12:17:20)

Ka'ra turns to face you as you approach her at the fighter and gives a light laugh. Running a hand along one of the wings, she moves to join you. "**It was one of my father's last and greatest work. He called it Ka'raverd, the Star Warrior. It was never built with hyperdrive in mind. Been having problems with the sled I attached to it.**" Her voice echoes out of her helmet as she speak, still never have removed it even when she was working. She had however taken her gauntlets off for the work, and they rest tucked into her belt.
"**Come, I will give you a tour.**" Now as she begins heading toward the cruiser she wipes her hands on a dirty rag she had pulled from her tool box. Heading toward the closed ramp, she stops and enters her code into the console. As she waits for it to lower, she asks, "**Have your affairs been set in order? I don't intend on coming back here unless necessary.**"

**"You make it sound like a death sentence, 'affairs in order'. Heh! But yes, I'm ready to go. Ka'raverd? Star Warrior? So you are a beautiful star, mistress Ka'ra, eh?"** he asks, never passing up a chance to flirt, even with a Mandalorian.
*By the Force look at the weapon emplacements on this thing!* he thinks as he makes his way to the ramp. *Damn, I hope she's paid a quarter of the attention to the engines that she has the guns.*

Ka'ra gives a small laugh at the attempt to flirt with her. "**What makes you think I'm not some ugly matron under this helmet, Mister Hoagra?**" With a sweep of her hand she motions for you to go ahead of her up into the ship. The inside seems to be as well maintained as it is outside. Either the ship is new or has been well looked after since its commissioning. However, coming from down one of the halls you can detect a rank smell, as if something was in severe need for a bath.
The sound of light footsteps comes down the hall and the sight of a strange creature takes you aback. It runs full on past you in a full sprint on its six legs, it's tail whipping past your ankles, and tackles Ka'ra whining while it rubs up against her. Staggered backward by the velocity of the creature she takes a small moment to collect her balance and then proceeds to pet the creature behind the ears cooing at it. The creatures brown fur twitches in pleasure causing the black patches to almost coalesce due to its fur coat's bagginess."**Su cuy'gar, Tent'ika,**" she continues on talking to the creature in her native tongue while it continues to whine and then it settles down, finally turning to face the newest member of the ship. The creature moves to circle you, its predator instincts coming to the forefront as it investigates.
"**Tentia is harmless. Just be nice to it.**" Ka'ra offers as she watches her companion.

**"Judging by your voice, I doubt it, and beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And mine eye is a fine judge of ships, of which you have two. Besides, even a matron would still be in good shape from wearing armor all the time…."** Tanith's rambling and ogling of the ship is interrupted by the creature's entrance.
*Ugh what a stench… and she's petting it! Damned Mandos are all insane. It is kinda cute in a 'its so damned ugly' kinda way though…* he thinks watching his new employer and her pet. As the thing begins to circle him he squats down on his haunches to speak to it.
**"You're a damnable ugly thing aren't you?"** he says as he pulls out a ration cube and holds it out towards the creature. **"We'll get along fine won't we? You won't try to eat me, and I won't decompress whatever compartment you sleep in,"** he says, trying to coax the creature into letting him pet it. **"We'll be good pals, eh? Tell you what, we get any boarders and I'll stun 'em so you can eat 'em. eh?"**

Ka'ra gives a laugh as you try to coax it. "**Strills are highly intelligent. I'd be careful what you say. Especially since Tentia is learning basic almost as fluently as Mando'a.**" The strill for its part smells your hand, but seems to turn its nose up at the food cube you proffered to it. Instead it nips at your hand in a playful manner then after a small dance where it leaps from side to side, it turns in a circle and then bounds off. With another laugh Ka'ra watches its antics. "**I think you two will get along fine.**"
Turning to hit the ramp controls to close it she reaches up to unclasp her helmet. With her back to you the first thing you see is the piled plait of bright red hair fall from its containment inside the helmet. As she turns back to you, your guess on her being younger than yourself was obviously dead on.
The woman before you can't be any older than eightee, seventeen if you were to take your best guess. As she looks at you her bright blue eyes sparkle with humor and a keen intelligence. "**Come I'll show you your bunk.**"

He tries not to jump too badly when the strill nips his hand. As it runs off he calls after it, **"Fine then,"** and lifts his helmet to eat the cube. After chewing and swallowing the chalky cube he looks at Ka'ra, **"I think its smarter than I am. It knew not to eat the cube…"** his words drop off at seeing her out of the helmet.
*Humph. Who'd have know Mandos could be poets… Those eyes. Ka'ra. Stars…*
**"Lead on, ma'am,"** he replies, thankful his helmet covered his expression and wondering if his voice betrayed him...

Nodding, Ka'ra passes by you clipping her helmet through shear habit at her belt as she walks. The cruiser itself has two levels this main level containing the cargo hold and engine room as well as the airlocks for the two docking clamps. Taking the wrungs to the ladder up two at a time she quickly climbs to the top. She waits for you to catch up before pressing on.
A series of doors you assume lead into cabins, six in total, take up the hallway just at the top of the ladder. "**There's three cabins with four bunks,**" she says pointing to the first set of doors on either side and one to the right. "**Two cabins with two bunks each,**" she adds indicating two more doors as she walks down. "**You can pick which cabin you want, but you may eventually have a roommate.**" Indicating the last door on the right going into the lounge, she says. "**This will be mine and of course Tentia's. My charge, Emily, may be traveling with us at some point and I'll let her pick a room for herself,**" she adds.
She doesn't stop as she proceeds down the hallway towards the bow. The hallway opens up into the lounge. A table and chairs takes up the floor to the left with a kitchenette and pantry storage taking up the wall around it. To the right, a fold down medical bay takes up a wall with more storage in place around it. To the right is also the lounge proper with a comfortable bolted down couch and a holochess table. She stops outside the door leading into the cockpit and opens the door. Letting you pass through first she lets you take in your newest 'assignment'.
The cockpit, while small, has two seats set in front of the necessary controls to maintain the ship's systems, which are, of course, currently powered down.

**"I'll take the cabin closest to the cockpit. I can store my bike and then help you out with your fighter. I'll come back here and salivate when I can fire her up, eh?"** he says, hoping she'll take it as wanting to be closer in an emergency than wanting to be further from the strill's stink.
**"If ypu've got this ship, especially with its docking clamps, why are you worried about the sled?"** he asks as he moves back towards the ladder down.

"**Doesn't hurt to be prepared**," Ka'ra says off handedly making her way back toward the back of the ship to the ladder. "**Besides, I had the fighter before I ever had this ship. Then it was necessity, now it's a convenience.**" Easily sliding down the ladder she waits at the bottom. "**My work is almost done. By the time you've settled in we should be able to set off. Thanks for the offer though.**" Not waiting for any sort of response she makes her way toward the ramp, placing her helmet back with twist of her hair around the back of her neck and a snap as it locks into place. Tapping the necessary controls, the ramp lowers again and she descends.

*I've got a feeling I'm going to regret this…* Tanith thinks as he follows her off the ship.
He makes his way to his bike and throws the switch to activate the repulsors, then leans slightly to one side and kicks hard on the thrusters, making the bike slingshot around in a narrow space. *Show off,* he chides himself with a grin, wondering if she'd seen the minor stunt. He kills the thrust to almost nothing and eases it up the ramp and into the cargo hold, where he looks around until he finds straps to secure it with.
After finishing with the bike he heads back up to the mess area and makes some caf, then sits down at the table with his tool kit and new shield.

If Ka'ra saw the stunt she didn't say anything about it as she picks up a discarded hydrospanner and resumes her work on the sled. As true as her word, her work doesn't take long and she boards the ramp as you finish locking the bike down in the hold. With the tool box held under one arm, she closes the ramp behind her with her free hand. She looks over the restraints, apparently checking over the work before moving toward a workbench to store the tools.
Leaving you to your work she heads up the ladder and enters her cabin, disappearing for a time. The strill on the other hand, having made its way to the habitat level, watches you with a steady gaze as it lounges on the couch. Its tail flicks much like a cat's as it watches you attempt to fix the shield.
After a couple tries to replace the wiring going to the power source you wisely decide that fixing it will require a bit more patience and work than you originally believed.

Tanith pulls off the helmet and lays it on the table next to him before fixing himself a cup of caf. **"You want some of this, little bit? Can't make you smell any worse,"** he says to the strill with a grin, indicating the caf, before sitting down and taking his time going over the problems with the shield.

As the wire your working with sparks, you find you probably did more damage than there was originally when you started. Having burnt out the new set of wiring you'll need to start all over again. Ka'ra enters the lounge, her hair wet over one shoulder. Wearing a simple pair of slacks and a tank you see her build is slimmer without the bulk of the armor. The strill let's out a long yawn, going back to sleep now that it's master is back in sight.
"**Problems?**" she asks coming to stand behind you, casting a critical eye on the device. "**Personal shield generator? Didn't think they made these anymore.**"

**"I got used to them during the wars. They can be the difference between a battle won and a ride home in a casket,"** he tells her. **"My friend Stavros had a few lying around, loaned it to me.

There's a smile in Ka'ra's eyes as she explains. **"I would be careful if I were you, not to keep such flirtatious habits. Such advances without the intention to court me might get you flung out the airlock by over protective family.**" There's a hint of sadness to her tone, but the smile never leaves her eyes.
Pulling up one of the chairs she takes it from your hands and turns it around carefully, surveying it. **"It hasn't been used in awhile obviously, and the wiring to the power source has been burnt out. Doubt the power source had much juice left expect for some residual power.**"
With deft fingers she replaces the wiring with the extra you have resting on the table. With the task done she presses the button to activate it. It gives a soft hum before growing dead. "**Elek, dead battery.**" Handing it back to you, she gives a small smile. "**If it was from a friend, I hope it serves you well. The best gifts are from the ones who care for you.**"

**"Ah, many thanks, lass,"** he says on seeing the damnable machine work properly for the first time. He turns the tools to his own arm and removes the power recharger there, then hooks it to the shield.
**"Stavros is my friend, granted, but he's also very intelligent. He loaned me this to protect one of his better clients. I bring him lots of business and buy from him too, eh?"** he says with a grin as he takes a sip of his caf. **"We can be on our way whenever you're ready."**

**"Done and done, lass,"** he says as he stands and heads for the cockpit. **"Your strill won't eat the shield and charger if I leave them there will it?"** he asks, watching the strill with one eye and winking at Ka'ra with the other.
Once in the cockpit he familiarizes himself with the controls while bringing the systems online. He then turns to the navicomputer to plot the jump while waiting for the engines to warm. After all systems are green he takes the control yoke and eases the ship towards orbit and to their exit vector. Once there he looks around for Ka'ra and asks, **"What's the name of this beautiful ship I'm flying, pretty eyes?"** as he reaches forward to manipulate the hyperspace controls...

As Ka'ra takes the co-pilot's seat, she does nothing more than to strap it leaving you to the work you were there to do. Already strapped into the seat when you begin the take off, she punches away at the controls ensuring you had clearance to leave. Leaning back into the chair as you break into orbit she keeps her hands in her lap, enjoying the ride. "**Atin Oya'ka,**" she answers simply when asked the ship's name.
Continuing to watch the stars grow brighter in the cockpit window, she stays in the seat till the stars elongate and the threshold into lightspeed is reached. She stays, apparently troubled by something which has come to the forefront of her mind. Obviously not used having her emotions seen for all to see she doesn't turn to look at you.
"**I'm afraid I've had to decieve you about our purpose, Mister Hoagra.**" With an audible click she releases the restraints "**I had to lie to you so your actions would be realistic for anyone watching.**" Still she makes no indication from moving from the chair. She remains perfectly still in her seat as she continues, "**I set out to create a team on the behest of a good friend… erm.. my employer for lack of a better word. One which he can use to help stop a great catastrophe.**" Finally she looks around, taking in the sight of the ship before her gaze rests on you. "**This ship will eventually serve as their base of operations… They're going to need a pilot, one who will know this ship better than anyone, to help them.**"
Looking down at her hands a silence draws out. "**We need someone we can trust to be here for them when it's not possible for us.**"
(( I"m afraid I misled you on how many cabins there were... The ship can actually have 14 passengers with 3 crew. I will be editing my last post to have three cabins with double bunks (four in each), 2 cabins with two bunks and a cabin for the captain. The captain's cabin is the one she takes, which will then actually be close to the lounge and cockpit. Sorry for that mix up.

**"Ms. *Bralor*, I was born during the night cycle on an Outer Rim world, but it *was* a while back, eh? I can tell a Hutt when I smell one.

A small smile forms on her lips, "**Yes… they do know how to make them, or at least get drawn to them.**" With a shake of her head the smile is gone and then, finally again she looks at him. "**I'll tell you what I can, but there are things even I don't understand or have sworn not to reveal.**"
"**You're right to assume Jedi are involved or at least in part. My employer was once a member of the Jedi Order, but he left sometime during the last war. He's been involved with a growing group of Force users, whose leader has been secretly attempting to… resurrect an ancient weapon.**" She smiles again at the word, another one she learned from her Jedi employer. "**If he succeeds, he could wipe out the entire galaxy within the year.**" She pauses a long while letting her last words sink in. "**Luckily, he hasn't found it yet, but it's only a matter of time.

Ka'ra reaches over and puts her hand on top of yours. "**I may not have been involved in the travesties the wars brought, but anyone who is willing to look can see the results.**" She shakes her head and removes her hand.
Looking out at the passing stars through the cockpit viewport she suddenly looks very tired. "**In a way, you've gotten your wish, Tanith. The Jedi Order has disbanded and are now being hunted by the remaining Sith forces. Some crime lords have even placed a bounty on anyone wielding a saber.**"
She sighs. "**The Jedi are easy to blame for everyone's problems because they have the power to fix it, but what's forgotten is they're just like everyone else. They cry, laugh and bleed just like anyone else. They even make mistakes, and even like the best general in war, when they make a mistake, people die.**"

**"I'll help. If for no other reason than to help you see the truth, to ensure that you live long enough to learn to avoid them,"** he says with a sad smile and a wink.
**"Now, more importantly, I take that this impassioned appeal to my sense of heroism means I won't be getting paid, eh? Paying clients rarely care what their employees think. Just another example of Jedi trickery,"** he says with a rueful laugh.

Ka'ra looks at you with a deep frown. "**My father hid spirits on board, I've never bothered to locate them.**" she says as she stands up from her seat and begins making her way toward the door to the lounge. She stops about to say something, but with a shake of her head passes through, closing the door behind her.
The trip to Tattoine takes at least eight hours, during which time Ka'ra knocks on the door once calling through whether you would like anything to eat. Otherwise she does you requested and leaves you alone unless you show signs of not wishing to sulk anymore.

*Hmph… You're old Tanith, and none the wiser for all your years,* he thinks as he checks the time till reversion, reclines the pilot's seat, and closes his eyes. *Next stop, Tantooine….*
**"Oww,"** Tanith groans waking after only thirty minutes or so. The banging on the bulk head and mention of food draws him out of the cabin to eat and wrestle with Tentia to pass the time, hoping to draw a laugh from the young lass...

### **Alicia** (2010-07-13 12:37:40)

Ka'ra places a tray on the table when she spots Tanith come out and begins looking for something to eat. There's a bowl of a hearty stew with some hard bread and a small piece of a flat cake you've never seen before. Still working within the confines of the kitchenette she pours the contents of a small bottle of what looks like milk into a bowl. Tentia watches as Ka'ra works, its tail twitching excitedly in anticipation of its own meal. Setting the bowl on the ground Tentia seems to pounce on the bowl, only to gently start lapping up the milky contents.
There's a smile on her face as she turns back to the counter and makes her own bowl of stew. She joins Tanith at the table and after tossing the long braid of hair over her left shoulder to fall upon her back, she gets to eating. Dipping some of the hard bread into the stew she seems to use it in place of a spoon. There's a long silence and then she asks "**How did you learn my clan name? Bralor. I don't recall ever telling you.**"

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-13 16:10:11)

**"Just showing that I understand cloak and vibro-blade operating, that I've dealt with it before. That's why I wasn't so shocked at your revelation, eh?"** he says while simultaneously inhaling the stew and bread. **"What did you put in there? Glitterstim and edible credits? Is there any more?"** he asks, looking around hopefully.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-13 17:27:44)

Ka'ra laughs as she grabs your bowl and stands going back to the pot of stew she has sitting on the stove. "I don't think you want to know what's in it." she says as she puts the bowl back down in front of you withe more bread. "This is also the extent of my cooking skills."
Sitting down again she goes back to eating becoming quiet.
Tentia finished with the bowl of milk jumps up onto the couch, stretches and begins licking its paws.

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-13 22:32:13)

This bowl isn't inhaled quite as quickly, but it's gone before long. **"Momma Lai had the bright idea to hire a Wookie cook a couple weeks ago. I'm not running to the refresher, crying, or both and it tastes good,"** Tanith replies. The entire time he speaks he stays turned and facing Ka'ra, but his eyes are on Tentia, watching and plotting.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-13 22:41:02)

Ka'ra gives Tanith a small smile before she finishes off her stew and picks up a small piece of the cake she had cut for herself. Taking small bites she relishes the dense, very sweet flat cake. Taking your own bites you see its made of ground nuts, syrup, pureed dried fruit and spice. Once done she stands and gets to work cleaning up the kitchenette and the used dishes.
Tentia continues to clean itself, but having noticed the attention you're paying to it, begins keeping a closer eye on you.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-13 22:51:11)

Tanith finishes his desert, finding he likes it even more than the stew. **"You made this? We could make a lot of money with this. Charge beings fifty credits a square centimeter. We'd be billionaires in no time, eh?"** he asks.
While waiting for a reply he pounces, taking advantage of years of honed reflexes, towards Tentia. He lands short intentionally, then dances around in a circle, mimicking its own dance, before running across the room to crouch down behind something and peer at the animal.

### **Alicia** (2010-07-13 23:00:11)

Ka'ra lets out a laugh as Tanith gets up and mimics Tentia. The actions at first startle the Strill, but then it seems to favor the game and jumps down from the couch to crouch low on the floor, its tail twitching as it waits to see what Tanith's next move is. Obviously the Strill is a patient hunter.
Recovering from the laughter Ka'ra sets the cloth she was using to clean the pot in the small sink. **"It's uj'alayi. Uj cake. My sisters and I made it when I was last home. Sadly, we ate the last of it. I've tried making it with other ingredients but it doesn't taste as good.** " She leans against the counter and watches your play with the Strill.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-13 23:23:23)

***"Well, lass, the little thing can't understand Huttese can it?"*** he asks in Huttese as he eyes the creature, before darting out of the room. Once he's out of the strill's sight he falls, intentionally making a great deal of noise, and waits...

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-13 23:53:59)

Ka'ra just shakes her head, muttering something in her own tongue and gets back to cleaning. Tentia isn't far off of Tanith's heels when he darts from the room. Faster than it appears it lands right on top of you after a brief jump, its weight effectively pinning you momentarily. The Strill then proceeds to slobber all over you as it licks your face, the rancorous stench heightened thanks to its proximity. After a couple licks, it jumps out of your reach, performing its usual playful dance, before running off further down the hall. It jumps down the ladder well, the fur around its legs expanding as it catches the air and glides down out of sight.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-14 00:03:39)

**"Gah!"** Tanith yells, failing to startle the beast again and finding himself slobbered upon. **"Come're you…"** he says as he gives chase, glad he's small enough to go rampaging through the tight confines of the ship with out harming it or himself. He continues chasing for a while knowing he can't hope to match the strill's speed, before stopping and hiding as best he can, hoping to catch it unawares on its way back. He activates his thermal scanner and looks through the wall, hoping to not get crept up on himself.

### **Alicia** (2010-07-14 10:22:17)

When you reach the lower deck it's already disappeared to a hiding place. Moving slowly you begin your search of the Strill, but as you reach the blast door going into the cargo bay, you find the door has closed, as was the door to the barracks. As you double back, you glance around the engine area and at the two gunwells, any being a great option for the Strill to hide, or to use to sneak up on you.
Or you could attempt to squeeze yourself around one of the engines (or another preferred spot), a perfectly good hiding spot and see if the Strill comes to find you.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-14 10:40:09)

Tanith knows an ambush when he sees one, and rethinks his strategy. *The fur ball knows the ship better than I do, it's smaller than I am, and faster. I need a choke point,* he looks around and decides to abandon the lower deck. He makes his way back to the ladder, intent on moving back to the upper deck and waiting there.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-14 17:09:25)

Moving to the upper level you find Ka'ra has moved to the couch in the long, and is engorssed over a datapad she holds in her lap. She doesn't glance up when you enter. "**Tentia likes to hide in the port gunwell, if it didn't make it into the vents,**" she remarks off handedly still not looking up from the datapad. "**Now that you've started play, it won't stop till one of you gives in. And Tentia can go for a long time, trust me.**"

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-14 19:39:30)

**"Port gunwell, eh?"** Tanith replies, then his eyes widen at the mention of vents. *The thing has access to the ventilation system?*
**"Well, we still have about, what, five hours to Tantooine? Can you suggest a better way to spend the trip?"** he asks as he moves to the console, intending to drop the temperature to drive the creature from the vents or keep it out of them.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-14 20:04:28)

Ka'ra looks up at that, a smirk growing on her face. "**I can think of several things which would entertain me,**" she says slowly, her smirk growing wider.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-14 20:11:52)

Tanith promptly forgets what he's doing and turns around fighting not to stammer or leer, **"And what would those be lass?"** he asks with his own growing grin.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-14 20:24:24)

Ka'ra sits up, throwing her legs back over the edge of the couch to sit normally, the datapad forgotten in her lap. With one finger she motions for him to come closer.
Only when you're closer does her intent to distract you become clear. From behind you there's a growl and then a heavy weight lands on your back in an attempt to tackle you to the floor. Erupting into giggles, Ka'ra fall backs deeper into the couch.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-14 20:30:39)

**"Gah! Betrayal!"** Tanith yells as he falls forward onto the couch in the general area of Ka'ra, hoping to drag her into the ruckus. He tries to catch hold of the strill and pull it from his back after landing.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-14 20:37:59)

Having been tackled forward, you manage to land very close to where Ka'ra has embedded herself in the couch. Caught up in the ruckus, her giggles increase tenfold. Her agility coming into play, she manages to extricate herself from under you and Tentia. The strill on the other hand manages to stay out of your reach long enough to soak your face with its saliva before jumping away again. Prancing in a circle in its dance it runs off again.
Ka'ra continues to giggle uncontrollably.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-14 20:41:52)

**"Ganging up on an old man eh?"** Tanith says, laughing and running shy of breath. **"Say lass, you don't happen to have any detonators lying around do you?"** he asks as he wipes slobber from his face.
**"I've never known a Mandalorian to run from an encounter, but you dusted off fairly quickly there, eh?"** he says with a wink and a grin.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-14 21:15:43)

Finally recovering her breath, she begins looking around for the datapad which had gotten removed from her lap during the ruckus. "**If by lying around, you're wondering if there are any aboard, there are. And no you may not,**" she adds with a grin. "**You started the battle with Tentia. I'm for the most part going to stay out of it.**" SHe grins again. "**I just couldn't help giving Tentia a point.**"

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-14 21:27:41)

Tanith grabs the datapad Ka'ra is hunting for and waves it in front of her, **"No lass, ya see, the lil fuzz ball already had two points to my one, eh? You're in it now,"** he says as he rockets towards the ladder and slides down it out of sight. At the bottom he bolts for the port gunwell hoping to catch Tentia, then heads for the engines to hide.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-14 21:44:25)

"**Osi'kyr!**" Ka'ra bounds forward in an attempt to tackle you. Even from her disadvantageous position as she searches for the pad, she manages to grab your leg tripping you to the ground. Keeping a firm grip she prevents you from running off. "**I'll be taking that back,**" she says determinedly.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-14 21:56:35)

**"Awfully confident aren't we, wee lass? Ha!"** he exclaims while laughing and halfheartedly struggling to break free, making sure to keep the datapad out of her reach. If he breaks the hold, he won't run far or fast, more from lack of breath and wanting to be caught than lack of ability.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-14 22:11:40)

Ka'ra lets out a growl of frustration as you manage to slip out of her hold. Quickly gaining her feet, she charges forward in another attempt to tackle you. However, you manage to dodge breathlessly out of the way. Standing up straight, she crosses her arms over her chest. "**Having fun?**" she asks, in an annoyed tone. There's a fire in her eyes, that wasn't there before as she regards you.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-14 22:17:22)

**"Well 'course I am. When was the last time you did something so simple and enjoyable eh? What's eating you all of a sudden?"** he replies, feeling a little ire of his own. *What the hell did I do to earn that look?* he wonders, looking out of the corner of his eye for Tentia, half expecting another trap.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-14 22:28:51)

"**N'eparavu takisit**," Ka'ra says, turning her gaze away. "**You hold a letter from my little sister.**" Moving towards you she holds out her hand for the datapad. "**Things aren't going well back home**," she explains further.
Tentia sits at the top of the ladder, its tail twitching and mouth lulled open showing several of its sharp teeth as it regards the two of you.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-14 22:45:43)

**"Oh no, there's more of you?"** he says with a wink, **"Here. Your going to have to teach me Mando'a if your going to keep reverting to it. What does 'Osi'kyr' and 'N'eparavu takisit' mean? All I know is 'Su cuy'gar' which is 'so you're still alive' and a couple farewells' meanings: 'shoot straight and run fast' and 'die well,' but I don't remember how to say either."** he says as he hands her the datapad and crouches down to beckon to Tentia.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-14 22:56:21)

"**Actually I have five brothers and sisters. Not all of them are like me, though my little sister seems to want to follow my mistakes**." A small smile escapes to Ka'ra's lips as she takes the datapad back. Glancing at it, she checks to make sure the datapad didn't get damaged in the tussle.
Tapping it off she answers your questions. "**N'eparavu takisit is an apology**," she pauses a moment thinking. "**It means literally 'I eat my insult'**," she explains with mild amusement at the translation. "**Osi'kyr means.. well… you surprised me**," she stutters having a hard time finding the words.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-14 23:02:39)

**"Hmmm? Cursed me did you lass? Heh, don't worry about it. Tends to happen a great deal actually. Do you need to talk of your familial problems? I'll listen, in exchange for another bowl of that stew,"** he replies, still trying to get Tentia to come to his hand. *Stubborn little slobber dispenser,* he thinks as he stands, the horseplay reminding him of his age through minor aches and pains.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-14 23:09:24)

Ka'ra shakes her head. "**I doubt you really want to hear my woes. Besides…there's nothing I can do about them except worry and hope they keep their heads.**" She moves back toward the kitchen looking behind her. "**There isn't any more stew for today, but if you really want some I can make it for later.**" Even though she claims her cooking skills aren't diverse she offers readily enough.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-14 23:16:12)

**"Na, don't bother. Is it typical 'father doesn't like daughter's new interest'? Heh, you wouldn't believe how many times I've heard that one,"** he says, checking his chrono to see how long before arrival. **"So tell me about you. How did a wee Mandalorian lass end up running errands for Jedi trying to save the galaxy from themselves, eh?"** he asks.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-14 23:29:06)

Ka'ra frowns at the question, her expression quickly hidden as she turns back to the kitchen. "**Ni vercopa ibac haat,**" she says to herself with a sigh. "**My father doesn't notice much of anything these days…**" she says louder to you. Taking her time in answering she pours herself a mug of hot water, adding some leaves to it to steep. "**That's a rather long story… You have obviously heard something about me since you know my clan name… What is it?**"

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-14 23:37:06)

**"First off: what is 'Ni vercopa ibac haat'? Second: not much. You're known for having the skill to bring beings in alive. Third: you dropped out of the game a while back, some thought you dead. That and what you've told me about sums it up,"** he replies, making a pot of caf for himself.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-14 23:55:28)

Ka'ra seems to ignore your request for a translation. Her gaze grows distant as she takes a seat at the table and begins string the tea she made.
"**They wouldn't have been wrong**," she says slowly, not even seeing what was actually in front of her. "**I should be dead.**" The clatter of dishes as you make your caf seems to jolt her out of the trance. "**I should be dead,**" she reiterates. "**But I was saved. I owe him my life. That is why I follow him.**"

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 00:00:59)

**"Well then let's hear it. And while you're at it, translate this bit for me: Ni vercopa ibac haat,"** he invites her to continue and shows that he doesn't like being ignored. **"I didn't think Mandalorians believed in the practice of life debts."**

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 00:15:25)

"**Most don't, but my family follows the old traditions. We're held by honor to fulfill any debts, though we're careful about what debts we place ourselves in**." Ka'ra cocks her head at you, pausing for a long moment before continuing. "**Above all I was taught to follow the Resol'nare. The Six Actions of life.**" Again she seems to ignore your request to translate, instead she says. "**Here's a word: atin. It means stubborn, tenacious.**" There's a small smirk on her face as she defines it. "**And another one… aruetii. Foreigner, outsider.**"

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 00:20:33)

**"Fine then, don't tell me what 'Ni vercopa ibac haat' is. Instead tell me about the Resol'nare, and what the other half of the ship's name is eh?"** he says, yielding the point but determined to ask the next Mandalorian or translator droid he came across.
**"So I'm a nosy outsider now?"** he asks with a grin of his own.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 00:27:47)

Ka'ra is still smirking when she says. "**You are asking a lot of questions about my people. And the Resol'nare is sacred to us.. I'm not just going to tell you unless you were intending on joining us.**" Taking a long swig of the tea, she then sets it down on the table. "**My father had a strange humor. Oya'ka can mean 'hunter' or 'one who lives'.**"

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 00:33:57)

**"No, I was asking questions about you, and you didn't want to answer. Then you changed the subject to your customs,"** he replies with laugh and a shake of his head. **"Fine, fine. What *will* you talk about lass?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 00:49:21)

Ka'ra smiles, finding herself caught in a trap of her making. "**You asked about why I would follow the practice of life debts, that's as much as I can tell an aruetii. I made a pact with him, and I intend to see it through.**" There's a movement under the table as Tentia moves under it to come to rest at Ka'ra's feet, its head laying in her lap. Absently she pats it on the head and scratches the strill behind the ears. Content, Tentia seems to purr, a deep rumbling sound emanating from its chest.
"**Ni vercopa ibac haat**," she says at last after a few long moments of thought. "**I wish that is truth.**" With another sip of tea adds, "**It would be a simpler matter if my father disapproved of my sister's supposed interest. Though I wouldn't blame him.. she's only thirteen**" She grins at you, the thought amusing her.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 00:59:10)

**"So I take it the problems at home have something to do with your father?"** he asks, looking up slowly. He then sits back somewhat, **"Mayhap you should tell me the rest of it, eh?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 01:19:30)

Ka'ra begins stirring the tea again, before laying her hand on top of Tentia's head. "**I suppose,**" is all she says at first. "**My father hasn't been the same since he returned home to us. It's been hard on my younger siblings who want to rely on him, but find they can't. With our mother gone we only have each other to keep things together**." She shakes her head. "**Tamara is at the age where she should be taking the rite into adulthood, but she isn't ready.**"

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 01:28:05)

Tanith pours himself another cup of caf and grabs the shield and checks its charge, **"Well I would ask about your sister and why your people's rite of passage is so young, but I'm aruetii and that's probably more than I should know,"** he says as he takes a sip of caf and checks the read-outs on his gear, **"So instead I'll ask where your father returned from, and what happened to your mother, eh?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 08:17:08)

"**The war…**" she says as if it should have been obvious. "**My father blamed himself for a great many things. All he does these days is work, though he's driven himself half mad between drinks**." She shakes her head, not wanting to talk about her father's ineptitude. "**My mother… well… she was killed when Revan bombarded our planet,**" she says slowly. "**She was a doctor and when the alarms had gone up, she spent the last of her time making sure all the clinics had evacuated; never making it to one herself.**"
Tentia, its head still in her lap, begins to whine and only ceases when Ka'ra begins to scratch it behind the ears again.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 09:11:15)

**"My apologies, lass. The wars left terrible scars on the entire galaxy. I can you tell truly that I understand. I sometimes wonder at the way people treat me, then realize that my behavior is more'n a little odd. I've been known to drown my sorrows as well. I had a Herglic friend of mine put me in a hospital once, because I'd been to the bottom of too many bottles and mouthed off at him. Things I said, I wouldn't have blamed him had he crushed my skull instead of my chest and arm, letting me live,"** his voice dies off as his eyes see things from his past, open wide and staring, pupils dilated, oblivious to his surroundings.
**"We were losing, badly, when Revan joined the fray. Afterward, things became so different. It's like we had no control. Like we were beasts. The man's ability to 'motivate,' for lack of a better word, was terrifying. We did many things we weren't proud of. What little honor we had, what dignity, we threw away at his words, because he said we had to in order to win,"** he trails off again, the sorrow and regret in his eyes briefly vanishing beneath a tumultuous wave of hatred before reverting to their usual mix of intelligent liveliness tinged with sadness.
**"One day, hopefully soon, your father will learn to distract himself fully, and without drink. The scars never go away, but a being can learn to live with them. He'll find a balance, similar to what I have. That's why he works, it keeps his mind from it. That's why I fly, and chase smelly slobber dispensers around young Mandalorian lass's ships, and snatch datapads from said lasses without knocking them out first, eh?"** he tries to bring the conversation back to a happier note, with a joke and a wink.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 09:51:38)

Ka'ra smiles slightly, but the past still dances in her eyes as she remembers her mother and her worry for her family follows. "**Vor entye, Tanith**," she says. With another sip of tea she directs the conversation about you. "**So, how did you end up on Nar Shaddaa? The hive of scum isn't exactly the place I would want to retire to.**"

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 10:19:49)

**Well, when the peoples you've fought and bled for turn out to be blind idiots you tend to leave their company as soon as possible. Nar Shadda is a cesspit, but that's the point. Other than a small handful of beings, the people there deserve all the bad of the planet. A man doesn't feel the need to waste his life and credits trying to save cutthroats and glit-biters, eh? I can live there with out losing what's left of my sanity, without caring about things I can't control anyway. And being that far away from the Republic lets ignorance be my bliss. I can't see their stupidity and don't have to listen to their mindless gibbering over the lack of Jedi,"** he explains, pausing now and then to sip his caf. He manages to keep his voice, if not his words, light and conversational.
**"Besides, life inside the Republic isn't…. easy for an old soldier. Military life just doesn't mesh well with their neat and orderly world. Hard to work, harder to play, eh?"** he continues, struggling to express this idea.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 10:25:38)

"**You really don't like Jedi do you?**" Ka'ra asks slowly, but then shrugs realizing it was a pointless question with you having expressed such an opinion a couple times before. As long as it didn't effect your work, it wasn't any of her business. "**I suppose I could understand not being able to fit in**," she says sarcastically. Mandalorians and old soldiers seemed to have something in common, no one wanted them around.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 10:38:23)

**"I imagine you see a lot of racism and discrimination, lass, but it seems to be worse for those of us who fought for the Republic. We bled for them, we didn't bleed them, and we still get treated as rabid kath hounds,"** he says, with a wry smile and a wink to take any insult out of his words.
**"As for Jedi, I can't say I understand why you or anyone else doesn't see what they've done, and what they can do, but I do know when I'm pushing my opinions all over people like Tentia and her slobber, heh! I'll keep my dislike quiet in the future, and I can promise you it won't affect my professionalism. In the Republic Army and more so in the Navy you learn quickly to work with people you hate, namely idiot officers who shouldn't be off their mother's apron strings, eh?"** he continues while pouring himself the last of the caf and cleaning up his mess.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 11:19:07)

"**It**," she corrects. "**Tentia is a hemophrodite**." There's a grin on her face, having changed the subject.
Tipping her cup she glanced at the remaining dregs of tea. "**Niandra said you were an exceptional pilot. She was sad you had left on the terms you did. Though she always speaks of those days with a frown on her forehead. She's so serious.**"

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 11:28:28)

**"No one speaks of those days without a frown lass. Niandra never learned to lighten up, at least when I knew her. She kept us out of a great deal of trouble, against our wishes mind you, on many a planet-side leave,"** he says with a wry smile, remembering the stoic and capable woman. He holds out his hand, gesturing for her cup so he can wash it if she's done.
