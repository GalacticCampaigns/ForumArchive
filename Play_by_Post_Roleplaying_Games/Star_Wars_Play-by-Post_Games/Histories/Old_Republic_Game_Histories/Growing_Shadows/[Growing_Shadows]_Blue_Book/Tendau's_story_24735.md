**Personality**
Tendau has a quick wit and always enjoys a good laugh. His love of all things living has him mindful of what repercussions his actions have on not only himself, but those affected by his decisions. In combat he prefers to take a more defensive stance initially, so as to wield his strong telekinetic powers to their fullest affect.
**Backstory**
Tendau was but a child padawan when his Master Dekel followed Revan to halt the Mandolorian crusade. Being too young to fight he was left behind at the great temple on Coruscant. Initially hurt by being discarded by his Dekel, he used his time in the temple to better his own knowledge of living creatures and fauna, having inherited his people’s great love for nature. Aside from his academic pursuits he trained even more ardently on his lightsaber skills and his connection to the force so as to be ready if his master called for him to join him on the outer rim battlefields. As the war progressed and he never received the call for his presence, Tendau was offered an apprenticeship to a newly minted Jedi Knight, Garrus Atel’ya, a bothan.
Garrus was ardent in following the council’s wishes to wait on entering the war, and was key in instilling this in his pupil. Tendau took these principals to heart, giving him a great love of the Jedi way, knowledge and defense. After a few years training with Garrus, Tendau and his master were called into action during the Jedi Civil war. The men and women, who were the Republics greatest champions, were now the greatest threat it had ever faced. Through out the course of the war Tendau and his master engaged former comrades and friends in fierce combat, weathering Tendau and giving him the casual and confidant manner in which he carries himself both in and out of combat. While many friends and former friends fell around them both to their emotions and to enemies Tendau pushed on, as best they could from warzone to warzone, jungles to deserts it all seemed a blur to him. That was until near the closing volleys of the civil war, when the tandem was assigned to a boarding party at the Battle of the Star Forge. When they landed aboard one of the shattered Sith vessels attempting to keep the Republic from laying waste to the Sith’s weapon.
Upon boarding the ship with a small party of other knights and republic marines Tendau was confronted with his greatest challenge of the war. As they strode through corridors hacking and slashing, blocking and redirecting, dodging and parrying through the chaos of battle when suddenly striding towards them after impaling one of their Jedi comrades on his blood red saber, was Tendau’s former master Dekel. With a shout Garrus leaped at him with his green blade flashing out at his foe’s head. Tendau stood stock still for a moment, unable to fathom who he was being forced to do battle against. His first father figure, although he had been left behind for the war, he had loved him. An inner battle of emotions raged through him as Garrus’s and the Dekel’s sabers flicked across Tendau’s vision. Tendau finally sprung into action, gathering his concentration he began flinging shrapnel and debris from the shattered vessel against Dekel. Hitting him from all sides and causing him to stagger backwards into a blast door. Having his back against the wall, literally, the Sith lashed out with his powers blindly, while attempting to clear his blurred vision. Garrus surged forward seeing his opening and swung at the exposed side of Tendau’s former master and landed a solid blow to his chest. The Sith enraged blasted Garrus with the full extent of his sizable powers. Tendau stunned by his master’s sudden fall, when victory was so close spurred him into close combat with the wounded Sith. With a downward stroke of his own shining green blade, he bested Dekel. At seeing both of his master’s dead he bellowed with grief for the friends he had lost in the depravity of war.
Upon the conclusion of the battle it was apparent that the Jedi order was in severe trouble and the galaxy was in dire turmoil. Being an Ithorian with a strong love of life, he petitioned the council to be allowed to help in the restoration efforts of some of the shattered worlds that were left in the wake of the civil war. As his service aboard the Herdships progressed, Tendau heard rumblings of Jedi disappearing and great violence surrounding the places they had been gathering, he felt it best to leave the ships to avoid bringing undue harm to those who were healing the galaxy.
As Tendau enters the story as a bit of a wanderer with a wish to continue to heal the hurt that he feels as a Jedi he should have been able to safeguard.

It's cool night on the streets of Tattooine, a welcome respite after the long day in the heat of the two suns. After having left the Herdships behind you, fearing for their safety, you sought refuge on the desert world. The desolate planet holds little but sand. Still something seems to have called you here. After long days of hitch hiking and trading for your passage to Tattooine you finally made it, only to find the call silent. Now you wander the dusty streets of Anchorhead. Signs of Czerka's hand in the development of the town is evident everywhere. Flyers plaster some walls, wanted ads for various troublemakers on one for a srpouting bounty hunter's guild, advertisments for a few of the more popular speeder bike racers (apprently a growing attraction), hired help on a board outside the cantina and guards in Czerka uniforms patrol the ares, casting you a suspicious glance as you pass. With the shops closed fpr the night, the streets are empty of the town's inhabitants. Those out can be seen taking drunken steps from the local cantina as they make their way home to their adobe. Periodically you spot the glowing amber eyes of one of the desert planet's natives, the Jawas. However, you don't sense the Jawas are the only sentients watching you this night.

Tendau strode down the street enjoying the respite the nights brought to this harsh world. Always one to enjoy the peace that came with the fall of night, but this evening did not feel right. The silence that seemed to descend on the streets of Anchorhead was not a calm enjoyable quiet but an eerie daunting silence. Trusting his senses to the force he reaches out to try to locate any possible danger.
As he reaches out with the force Tendau starts to hurry down the street towards where he is currently staying, hoping to see a friendly face or at the very least avoid violence.

You proceed to walk down the street, reaching out with your senses, but the presence continues to alude you. You know one thing for certain, who ever is following is apt at hiding his or her presence.
Walking quickly you manage to find the small dwelling you were directed to upon arrival. A hovel really, it provides sufficient protection from the frequent sandstorms which come and go on the planet. Still, it seemed rather expensive for the price it was rented to you for. It seems unlikely that it will offer much protection from who ever, or whatever is following you.

Gazing at the run down hovel he has been taking shelter in, Tendau quickly decides it is in his best interest to be moving on. He cannot seem to shake the creeping feeling that something terribly wrong is about to happen from his thoughts. Again he reaches out with his senses to see if he can locate the source of his growing unease.
((If nothing Detected / Not interrupted Tendau then does the following actions))
Knowing that his feelings are often correct, Tendau dashes inside the house and quickly throws the rest of his belongings into his travel pack and slings it on his back, making sure to have his lightsaber in an easily accessible, yet discreet location inside his robes.
After finishing his hurried packing, which thankfully was mostly completed before hand, Tendau decides to move back towards the more populated center of Anchorage and hopefully the starport. The desert dreariness and creeping feeling causing his dislike for this world to mount by the second.

As you make your way toward the center of town, you manage to spot the creature following you. As it leaps from one rooftop to the next, following along your course, you see the strange six leggeded creature. Doing nothing more than following and watching you, you make it to the center of Anchorhead unmolested. Guards are continuing to patrol this part of town, making sure that the drunken inhabitants don't get carried away. The spaceport isn't too far, but whether there's someone willing to head out in the middle of the night is another matter entirely.
The creature you see perches near the edge of the roof, giving up on the hide and seek game not that it realizes you've spotted it. While in the dark of night you can't get a good glimpse of it, you can tell from its silloette its as long as a human, with its tail making up most of its length. From the way its been gliding easily from the rooftops, its quite agile in the air.

After spotting the creature perch atop a nearby building Tendau gazes up at the creature trying to discern what it is that is stalking him through the dying light of Tatoonie's twin suns. Focusing his eyes and racking his brain on the various lifeforms he has had exposure to and studied vigorously over the years.
Travel-pack shifting uncomfortably on his back, and robes swaying as he fidgets nervously he again checks his lightsaber stowed under his travel cloak. Hoping this creature is not hostile, but planning for the worst he prepares himself for inevitable confrontation with the creature, whether peaceable or otherwise.

### **Alicia** (2010-07-04 00:20:05)

The creature doesn't move from its perch as it watches its Ithorian prey. Its tail twitches in anticipation of its catch. From your vantage you can still see very little of the creature. Looking carefully you can spot the six legs the creature crouches on. Even with your extensive knowledge in living creatures you have a hard time placing what this creature is. What you are sure of, considering how its behaved thus far, it's defintly a predator, and, from your knowledge of indegionous fuana of the planet, definitly not native to Tattooine.
As it watched you from atop the building it shows a keen intelligence and patience. However, with each twitch of its tail, it's a question of how long such patience will last. For now the creature seems to be waiting to see what your next move is going to be or for something else to occur.
As that thought flits through your mind as a possibility a shrill call sounds and as quickly ends. The creature lifts its head slightly, cocking it at in angle as it listens, and then bounds off, gliding to the next rooftop and then disappearing completly. This move provides a good view of the creautre's silloete. Flabs of skin around the creature's six legs expand out as flaps, catching the air and allowing it to glide easily. Its long tail follows behind serving to balance and steer the creature in mid-air.

Frustrated by his inability to place the creature, and acutely aware that what ever danger had been tracking him had passed momentarily, Tendau quickly decides it is in his best interest to shelter in the more populated center of Anchorhead.
Glancing about cautiously Tendau pauses to take in where he is in what this backwater world would call a city. While still slightly unnerved by the silent predator that had stalked him through the first vestiges of night Tendau strides towards a Cantina hoping to find something to pass the time while he waits for morning. Deciding on the most reputable, or in the case of these establishments, least rotten, he strides down the street towards it with purpose all the while reaching out with his senses to make sure he is not surprised by a less apparent threat now that his tail had been called off the hunt.

The choice in cantina you find is an easy one. Anchorhead boasts only one of these establishments and while the exterior is plain enough, the inside is filled with the lively, rowdy patrons of a bored community which has found themselves with a bit too much time on their hands. You manage to find a quiet corner of the bar, where a droid bartender approaches. It's sentient counterpart, a chevin, glances over at you from the other side of the bar where he his dealing with a pair of particularly rowdy humans.
The cantina, the local hub of night time entertainment, features all one might expect from an unsavory establishment. The loud music of some sort is played from a projector where a holographic representation of the band can be seen. In one corner a series of slots can be spotted and next to it some sabaac tables which are currently filled with those hoping for a bit of luck. On the other side a couple dancing girls entertain a slew of patrons who watch with wide eyes.

Tendau greets the approaching droid amicably, but requests something non-alcoholic realizing with the dangers that seem to be being drawn after him this evening may not be best dealt with in a drunken stupor.
Chuckling quietly at the thought of trying to ward off a Sith platoon while staggering about singing a bawdy Ithorian drinking song brought rare smiles to the young Jedi's face.
After shaking off the amusing scenario and bringing back his thoughts to the here and now as his old master Garrus used to drone on to him about when ever he allowed his mind to wander as a child. After ordering a beverage from the serving droid Tendau approaches the Chevin to see if he can be of assistance with the rowdy patrons, hopefully finding a peaceable solution to the dispute.
"Greetings Sir, I could not help but notice the tussle going on over here. Is there anything I can be of assistance with?"
Upon stating this Tendau readies himself to attempt to resolve this dispute as conflict free as possible, striking a defensive posture.

The droid seems to grudgingly pass over a glass of Juma juice, made without alcohol. The golden liquid spills over the rim as you move to the other side of the bar where the Chevin bartender is dealing with the two human patrons. As you approach you can tell that whatever is occurring between the two men is not going well and as soon as you arrive to stand beside them the first blows are taken.
The chevin, dismayed as one of the humans throws the other into a nearby table. "**Want to help? Get these imbeciles out of here before the break everything in sight!**"

Stepping closer to the two men trading blows in the Cantina, Tendau gathers his will to come between the pair of fools.
**It would be wise to go home and sleep off the affects of the night gentlemen.** He states as cordially as he can while concentrating on one of his advanced force techniques. Angling the men between him and a wall he lets loose with the force to separate the men just as he reaches out to touch them. Miming throwing them apart and hopefully covering up his exertion.

### **Alicia** (2010-07-05 13:06:48)

The two men are thrown from each other with a great display of strength (provided by your strong connection of the Force). With one of the men close to the wall, he gets thrown against it, the wind knocked out of him as he slumps to the floor, unable to catch his breath for a long moment and appears on the verge of passing out from the blow. The other man, drunk and unable to keep his feet, falls on his behind at your feet. The man at your feet head shakes as he tries to re-orient himself.
"**What's the deal, hammerhead?!**" he shouts in a druken slur from the floor finally coming to enough to see who had interfered.
Behind you, the servers under the chevin's employ are beginning to clear the minor wreckage caused by the two drunks. Others mingle with the other patrons attempting to put them back at ease. Things are getting back to normal now that to two have stopped fighting.

Letting the slur slide due to the mans obvious shock at being forcibly removed from his conflict with the other gentleman, Tendau looks down upon the men and states, **I apologize my friends, I didn't realize the extent of my own strength. I merely wished for the hostilities to cease. Come let me buy you a round of drinks as an apology for my interference.**
Tendau then turns to the Chevin and requests another round for the now docile but upset hooligans. After ordering the drinks Tendau motions for the men to join him at a table, with him sitting between them, to enjoy their last beverage of the night and hoping the force will guide him through what ever trials still await him in the deepening night outside.

The men are happy enough to accept the drink and the chevin bartender passes over another round. They amicably talk over you as they share in the drink their differences forgotten with the round of drinks. Their talk turns to the swoop races, a growing past time in Anchorhead and their favorite racers. You learn a Hutt is controlling the growing franchise and is continually looking for racers. Periodically they seem to leave the settlement and then inadvertently disappear. Czerka and the Hutt are blaming the sand people, an easily accepted reason due to the problems the settlement was having with them almost a year ago.
Eventually, the two men finish their drinks and decide its late and stagger towards the door. Slowly the cantina had been quieting down as the inhabitants dispersed for home. Across the cantina you notice a strange sight, and you're not sure how you have missed her till now or when she had entered the cantina. Sitting in a far corner of the cantina is an armored woman. The armor itself is unusual, nothing you have ever recalled coming across. The black - blue armor is form fitting showing it was definitely made for her. The T-visor on the helmet, you find, bears a striking resemblance to the ones found on the Mandolorian helmets worn during the war.

After watching the inebriated men stagger into the warm night air Tendau notices the woman in the strange blue armor. Something at the back of his mind triggers images from the holo-vids of the Mandolarian crusade but the make definately has a distinctive flair to it, most likely a custom job he thinks.
Sitting for a few more moments he ponders what he should do, judging by how she had been gazing in his direction, he knew his display had probably been seen through by at least this individual. Sipping slowly on the the remainder of his Juma Juice he comes to the conclusion that approaching this stranger is probably in his best interest of keeping his cover as just an innocent traveler.
With a sigh of contentment Tendau puts back the last sip of his drink. Standing slowly he pushes back in his chair and strides with apparent purpose towards the armored woman.
**Good evening sentient, I couldn't help but notice you had been looking in my new found friends and my direction. Is there something I can help you with? Maybe something we could discuss over a drink?** With that Tendau takes a seat to the right of woman and waves for the serving droid to come over.

## Re: [Growing Shadows - Blue Book] Tendau's story

### **Alicia** (2010-07-06 11:37:48)

The woman had been scanning something on her bracer computer located on her left arm when you started to approach her. There's a drink sitting untouched on the table in front of her and a blaster at her right hip is in easy reach to be pulled. Her head cocks in curiosity- the only visual cue you get from her with her helmet on- as you address her and sit down.
When a Rodian server approaches, she waves him off, indicating the untouched drink in front of her. All the while her gaze never leaves the stranger beside her. She's quiet for a long moment as if deciding if she wants to speak or not, her gloved hands are folded casually on the table in front of her.
"**It's not everyday one of your sort makes an appearance here.**" her lilted speech is accented like someone who didn't learn basic as their first language. "**Are you here visiting?**" she asks, only mildly curious.

## Re: [Growing Shadows - Blue Book] Tendau's story

### **jwol** (2010-07-06 17:15:10)

Keeping his voice low Tendau responds, **I can tell you could see through my acting with the drunkards, so I won't beat around the bantha.** Sighing softly he takes a deep breath and tries to refocus his thoughts to his present circumstances.
**I have only recently arrived on this world, and I do not yet know fully myself what has brought me here, but for a feeling that there is something here that I must find or do.** Pausing briefly and mouths opening as if to say something else, he continues after a minute or so. **As for not seeing many of my kind, it is true our numbers have been thinned greatly in recent years, but the same can be said for your people traveler.**
After stating thes facts and waiting several awkward and tension filled moments, Tendau inquires of the armored individual, **What brings you to this world Mandolarian?**

## Re: [Growing Shadows - Blue Book] Tendau's story

### **Alicia** (2010-07-06 18:10:42)

The armored woman gives a quiet laugh. "**I suppose it is good you have not inebriated yourself, Ithorian. Many a man has turned a table upon the sight of my kind. It is blessing we don't need our armor.**" She laughs again, a light musical sound amplified by the speakers used by her helmet. "**I have not been here long either. A hunt has drawn me here,**" she adds, cryptic in answering your question.
"**Do you have an inclination as to what you're to do here?**" she asks slowly.

## Re: [Growing Shadows - Blue Book] Tendau's story

Chuckling softly Tendau looks directly at the armored woman. **Many a man has also fallen to your kind, my brethren included. From my experiences it is not wise to wrestle a rancor if there is another path available.**
Looking back to his juice on the table he takes a sip and ponders how to respond to the Mandolorian's question. Tilting his head to the side and closing his eyes for a few seconds he draws a deep breath and centers himself. **There is no real answer to your question miss. I trusted in the force on my decision to come here when I left the herdships, and know there is something that has drawn me here. For what reason, I cannot say, but I will continue to listen for further instructions.**
Chuckling to himself again he continues, **For all I know, maybe it is to help you that I have been drawn here miss.**

### **Alicia** (2010-07-09 13:37:44)

The armored woman draws her hands apart, laying them flat on the table. "**You're instincts have not lead you astray yet.**" She pauses, before continuing, "**It is true I am part of the reason you were drawn here.**" Cocking her head to the side she takes in your appearance. "**You should be pleased, I rarely have a hunt be so difficult to pin down.**" With a short, harsh laugh she leans back in her chair crossing her arms over her chest, completely at ease. **"Don't worry though. If I wanted to kill you or take you in then it would have happened already.**" There's amusement in her tone as she explains.

## Re: [Growing Shadows - Blue Book] Tendau's story

### **jwol** (2010-07-09 15:50:40)

A slightly startled expression briefly flickers across Tendau's features. *She is quite sure of her abilities, it will be wise not to underestimate this one.* He thinks to himself.
**I have no doubt you could make life very difficult for me if you wished, but it would be unwise to underestimate those who trust in the force. I myself have seen your kind in battle and faced my own in it as well. If it was to come to that I believe you would have struck out already while my attention was occupied by the local patrons.**
Pausing briefly he takes another deep breath, continue to try to keep the calm facade he was presenting, while quashing the excited feelings tingling at the back of his mind, *maybe this is what I was sent for he thinks.*
**I supposed you tell me of your hunt to peak my interest, and one with your training and…** Tendau looks the mandolarian up and down taking in the armaments she is wearing, **…gear hasn't already tracked and taken them down, then you may be in need of assistance. Assistance I may be able to provide, depending on what it is you hunt of course…**

"**I think you misunderstand. You were the one I was hunting. My…**" she pause seemingly to seek for the correct word. "**Employer is in need of your expertise. When I failed to pin you down, he arranged for a… disturbance to draw you here.**" The woman's confidence seems to dwindle a little as she seems to try to wrap her mind around what exactly had transpire to bring you here. Apparently what ever the plan was to make it happen was beyond her complete understanding.

Taking a moment to let the information revealed to him by this mysterious stranger he discreetly checks the position of his lightsaber. **Well it seems you have found me sentient, but your employed must be quite powerful to have just
'caused' a disturbance of that magnitude. Powerful or playing with forces they don't fully understand.**
Sliding his chair out slowly he stands and looks at the armored woman. **Seeing as you have tracked me here, and obviously are not of hostile intent, shall we discuss the details of why you would need one such as myself in a more private place?**

### **Alicia** (2010-07-09 16:19:55)

Hesitantly, she adds. "It was more of a call to you than anything happening in particular. I believe all he did was amplify the disturbance from the problems already here to get your attention." WIth a wave of her hand in dismissal she cuts her own thoughts off. "I don't try to understand it, when he gets technical."
The woman nods as you suggest to relocate. "**That would be best. Would you prefer to choose the place? Or will one of my choosing be sufficient?**" Standing with you, she awaits to hear your response or to proceed in leading her there. As she stands you see she is of an average human height, barely over five and a half feet. Her movements are sure and have a certain grace to them.

With a nod the Ithorian adds,**One of your choosing will be sufficient, although out of this sith forsaken heat would be beast, my kind is more used to temperate jungle worlds, not so much these dry arid worlds.**
Shifting his travel pack to a more comfortable position on his back he adjusts his cloak making sure it covers everything it should, mainly his weapon of choice. After getting himself ready to leave he looks at the Mandolarian woman and nods, **I am ready when you are sentient.**

</div>

Returning the nod, the woman heads toward the exit of the bar, tossing a couple credits on the bar as she passes it. "**I have a ship waiting at the spaceport, if that will suffice. It's secure and we won't have to worry about the wrong ears overhearing.**" She looks to you for any dissent, without it she leads you toward the destination.<div style="text-align: right;">
![Fileiddcc9z729_10d5v4p9gg_b.jpg](http://i125.photobucket.com/albums/p63/aliciababy86/Gaia-SW-GS/characters/Fileiddcc9z729_10d5v4p9gg_b.jpg)

A familiar feeling of being watched causes you to look up toward the rooftops. Once again you spot the creature stalking you from on high, following your trek toward the port. The woman also seems to notice the creature, but doesn't appear bothered by it. Leading you to an isolated pad within the port you come face to face to a Citadel-class cruiser. The ship is good shape from what you can see from its exterior, but without knowing a lot about the nuances of vessels there isn't much else to discern about it from a first glance. As you head closer to the vessel, you found you have been joined by the strange creature. Waiting at the bottom of the open ramp you finally get your best view yet of it.
Sitting on its six legs it waits with a growing whine as the woman approaches. It opens its mouth revealing the double and croaked rows of sharp teeth. Covered in fine brown fur with black patches, its skin bags and folds over on itself. Within feet the creature pounces on the woman, finally unable to contain itself. The whines continue as she staggers catching her balance. "**Ni'vaab ori'jate**," she coos to the creature as she scratches it under it's chin. "**Jii, slan oya'ka!**" she exclaims, shoving the creature off a bit. In excitement, it bounces around from side to side on its six legs, dancing in a small circle before disappearing into the darkness once more.
She laughs in amusement at the creatures antics before she walks the rest of the way to the ramp. "**I hope Tentia didn't startle you earlier. I had charged it to keep an eye on you till we met.**" Entering a code into the panel and the ramp lowered. "**After you,**" she says, with a sweeping gesture into the ship.

Now looking at the creature around the woman's legs, playfully pouncing around Tendau takes a better look at the creature.
((+13 Knowledge life sciences to identify the creature))

***16*** <- [16] 1d20

*Hmm* he ponders, *these are not the most common of creatures*. **Not at all, you have quite a hunter there miss. If not for sensing something amiss I would never have noticed it. Quite agile, although,** Tendau wrinkles his nose, **up close that smell is a bit pungent.**
**Following the mandolarian further into the ship, Tendau looks for a place to sit and upon noticing one strides towards it. So sentient, what is it you wished to discuss, I can tell with a guardian like that not many would dare to enter your ship with out your express consent**. Chuckling softly again to himself he awaits the mysterious woman's response.

## Re: [Growing Shadows - Blue Book] Tendau's story

### **Alicia** (2010-07-10 10:31:10)

Now that you've seen the creature properly you are able to put the clues together. While having never seen such a creature, you had heard rumors of Mandalorian generals and scouts who had such companions. Strills, or Striil in their own tongue, you remember, are highly intelligent creatures and being rather lived tend to surpass their own owner's lifetims. The best trained strills are passed down from generation to generation. Their pungent smell is the by-product of poor hygeine due to the many folds in their fur which are difficult to clean. As you've already witnessed, they are excellent fliers, making use of the excess skin to glide through the air.
Boarding the ramp, you are first greeted by the sight of a large cargo bay. While mostly empty, there's a splattering of the occasional crate secured within the hold. Behind you the armored woman walks up the ramp and stops at the top. With one hand she reaches over to the console and closes it behind her.
"**I guess I'm so used to the smell it doesn't bother me. Never has that I recall,**" she says with a shrug. "**Come, this way,** she adds, moving past you, heading further into the ship. Walking through a hatch she closes behind you, you leave the cargo bay behind to what you can only assume is the engineering bay. To either side you can see the massive engines which propel the ship and then past that the two airlocks, one of them currently in use. There's a ladder at the end of the hall which she stops at and again indicates for you to go first.
At the top of the ladder you face a long hallway with 6 doors. The hallway is decorated in a bit more comfortable fashion with a utalitarian carpet underfoot and actual paint on the bulkheads. Proceeding down towards the bow, the hallway opens up into a lounge area. A table and chairs takes up the floor to the left with a kitchenette and pantry storage taking up the wall around it. To the right, a fold down medical bay takes up a wall with more storage in place around it. To the right is also the lounge proper with a comfortable bolted down couch and a holochess table.
Obviously the final destination, the armored woman makes for the couch and seems to fall into it. She's quiet for a long moment. "**I seem to have forgotten my manners, Jedi. I'm Ka'ra Bralor. This is my ship the Atin Oya'ka.**" she bows her head slightly with the formal introduction.
"**My friend wanted to come and meet you himself but I'm afraid other matters is keeping him away. I'll do my best to stand in for him.**"
"**He wanted to find you not only because he believes your knowledge will be useful but because he knows the importance in preserving the past. Your expertise in the…**" she pauses thinking of the word. "**The Living Force may become fundamental is stopping a powerful Force user. One who is attempting to resurrect the power of the Force Harvester.**"

### **jwol** (2010-07-11 15:18:19)

Tendau nods at hearing Ka'ra's name. **It is understandable to have forgotten your manners, when I forgot mine as well.**
Bowing slightly the Ithorian then points to himself and replies, **My name is Tendau Mimwen, and as you have guessed, I am of the Jedi Order.**
Again pausing to think for a moment Tendau paces slightly as he allows the information about the reason he had been tracked and summoned. *Much danger seems to swirl around this course of events, very careful I must be.*
**So Ka'ra, my order is being exterminated, the galaxy is very much is disarray following the conclusion of the Jedi Civil war and the Mandolorian crusades. Much harm has befallen many innocents in recent years and if what you say is true and this device is brought online, that sounds like it could add even more death and destruction on top of recent events.**
Turning to directly face the mandolarian Tendau looks her directly in the visor and continues, **I'll need the details of what I must do, and if possible, I wish to meet your employer as soon as they are available, there is much we need to discuss.**
With that the ithorian falls silent and looks questioningly at Ka'ra, awaiting further information and instructions.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-11 17:54:56)

Ka'ra watches you pace as you absorb the information. "**At worst, it could wipe out the Force from the entire galaxy,**" she says slowly. "**We don't know what…**" she hesitates for a moment. "**His aim is in resurrecting this technology, but it can't be good. With the resources he possesses he may even be able to replicate it.**"
With a sigh she leans back further into the couch. "**It's my employer's wish to meet you as soon as he is able. For now he wants to help keep you safe, to preserve your knowledge as best as we are able to. It's his belief that since the Force Harvester absorbs the Living Force, knowledge can help to counteract its effects.**"
(( I have (yet again) changed my mind concerning the layout of the ship, but at least this time I have a map to explain things. I'll be expanding on the map adding more graphical detail as time goes on. For now it's a good basic layout. ))

### **jwol** (2010-07-12 01:55:41)

**A galaxy with out the force, that sounds like a nightmare…** Tendau trails off as if speaking his thoughts out loud.
Looking again at Ka'ra a look of sheer determination seems to settle upon his face. **Then it is settled Ka'ra, I cannot allow this to happen, as long as there is an ounce of strength left in these weary bones then I must stand between the galaxy and this growing threat.**
Glancing about the cabin he decides upon a part of the holotable and places his travel pack down. **Ahhh** The ithorian sighs in obvious relief to no longer be carrying all his worldly possessions.
**What do you need me to do Ka'ra, my talents are at your and your employers disposals.**

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-12 09:01:24)

*I think I may actually enjoy racing on this miserable rock,* Tanith thinks as he pulls up outside the ship. *From what I've seen tonight, any track would be a bit challenging, and the locals look trustworthy enough to liven it up by trying to kill me. Maybe we'll be here a few days.*
He reaches up and keys in the code Ka'ra had given him before she left to recruit another 'skilled, trustworthy person.' *Wonder how her hunt went. She took Tentia with her, if the fuzz ball didn't eat the poor sentient I should find out soon,* he thinks with a grin hidden beneath his helmet as he waits for the ramp to lower.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-12 10:44:39)

Ka'ra stands, "**For now… Just do your best to lay low. We'll leave once my pilot returns.**" Her head cocks to the side as she apparently hears something within her helmet. "**Hmm, that must be him now.**" she says and begins heading back toward the ladder, and then, cautiously down.
"**Su'cuy, Mister Hoagra,**" she says, upon spotting the older man, and she moves to help him bring in his bike. "**Have fun?**"

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-12 10:57:39)

**"Su'cuy, ma'am. So you found who you were after, eh?"** Tanith replies, extending his hand to the Ithorian with her while removing his helmet with the other hand. **"Tanith Hoagra, full-time pilot, sometime braggart, former soldier, and I try to never be a fool, but spirits and women usually keep me from dodging that,"** he introduces himself with a joke and a wink. The human is just below average size for his kind, with a wiry build and brown hair beginning to gray at the temples. He has quick brown eyes, and his equipment has a faded, often patched look that matches the man's own well-worn and slightly world-weary appearance.

---

### **jwol** (2010-07-12 11:18:59)

Chuckly softly at the human's introduction of himself, the lanky ithorian extends his own hand to shake Tannith's. **Greetings Tannith, those things usually can make a fool of even the strongest man from any species.** Letting out another small chuckle he continues **But again I let my manners lapse. I am Tendau Mimwen, and I am a *veteran* as well.** With a nod and a bit of emphasis on the veteran he hopes the human picks up on his meaning with out having to explain it further.
Turning slightly to face the mandolarian again, Tendau inquires; **I am sorry to be a bit off guard, but it has been a while since I have rested, your pet before I knew it was not here to harm me had me abandon my original plan of resting in my ramshackle hovel on this world.** Again with another small chuckle he continues with a slightly more serious expression on his face **It would be appreciated if I could meditate in some quarters, to catch up on some rest as we travel?**

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-12 11:28:52)

As Ka'ra finishes loading the bike into the hold she turns back to Tandau. "**Yes, of course. There are empty cabins on the next level.**" Turning around, she addresses Tanith. "**Would you please show him around? I'm going to find Tentia.**" It wasn't so much a request but a polite command, as she then gives a node to Tendau and heads toward the still open ramp.

---

### **jwol** (2010-07-12 11:38:40)

**Thank you Ka'ra.** Tendau says nodding in thanks to the armored woman. With that he wanders over to the holochess table and picks back up his travel pack.
Turning to Tanith the ithorian politely says, **After you sir.** Bowing slightly again to Tanith and waiting patiently to follow the human to his quarters, Tendau's pack shifting into a more comfortable position on his long back.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-13 04:21:15)

**"We're all veterans of something aren't we, eh?"** he says with a laugh, unsure about the odd comment, but also unconcerned. **"Tell me, can you cook? Momma Lai had an Ithorian cook for awhile, she did the most amazing things with the poisonous fungi that grew in the ally. She had an amazing singing voice too."** he rambles on as he leads the being through the ship.
**"Well, friend Tendau, the cabins are this way,"** Tanith replies gesturing towards the ladder. **"The two closest to the cockpit are taken, the rest are open, if I remember correctly. The cockpit is just beyond the lounge, the medbay and storage just before. Down here are the cargo hold and barracks, along with the engine compartment and gunwells."**

---

### **jwol** (2010-07-15 02:16:46)

Tendau chuckles at Tanith's comment about all being veterans.... too true he thinks. As he acknowledges the tour of the living quarters on board the ship Tendau feels drawn to the third room on the right. As it happens to be the first unoccupied room he wanders into it with his robes swaying slightly more than usual, revealing the lightsaber hilt on his belt to Tanith as he moves into the room.
**This one will be satisfactory.** Tendau says as he moves into the room gracefully like a stalking predator.
Turning once around the room and feeling at ease at his surroundings the ithorian hangs his cloak up on a peg near the door, leaving him in just his inner tunic. Lightsaber and utility belt clearly on display he drops into a medatative kneeling posture and tries to center himself as he waits out the duration of the journey.
((extremely sorry I misread the last couple posts, I was waiting for Alicia to move the plot forward, I didn't realize until I just re-read a moment ago that this one was on me hehe, again sorry about that for holding up the story))

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 02:26:28)

Tanith tries to shake the sour taste at the sight of the lightsaber as unbidden memories from both wars rise. He keeps it from his voice as he replies, **"Good, glad you like it. Someone will call you when meals are ready, Ka'ra's a damned fine cook."** He leaves the Ithorian to his meditations and looks for Ka'ra wondering, *Jedi already? Yeesh. Got to find out if we're headed off planet already or if I'll have time for a race or three.*

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 08:03:23)

Ka'ra returns some time later with a flow of words she directs towards the Strill, which is only audible should you be near the cargo hold at the time. Provided no one is there to greet her, she ensures the ramp is secured before heading up to the next level. Her helmet hangs secure at her hip, and she's going through her usual motions of unbraiding and quickly rebraiding her hair, letting fall back over her left shoulder.
Finding Tanith she asks, "**Has our new friend been made comfortable?**" The Strill wanders in behind her, its ears back as it sniffs around.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 09:20:34)

Tanith meets her at the foot of the ladder on the lower deck, **"I imagine. He's doing that odd meditating bit those Jedi do. Are we leaving right away? There's an opportunity to make credits here, and I'd have to risk my life to make them, makes much more fun, eh?"** he says with chuckle and a grin as he kneels and tries to pet Tentia yet again, this time trying to bribe her with a bit of dead something he shot while out riding.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 09:44:40)

Ka'ra watches as you yet again try to make friends with her companion, her nose wrinkling at the sight of the dead creature. Tentia though happily swipes the food, nipping your hand slightly in the process.
"**I'm on no set timetable. We aren't expect back at Telia V for a few days. A day here won't ruin that.**"

---

### **jwol** (2010-07-15 09:53:40)

Slowly drawing in a deep breath Tendau focuses on the here and now. Releasing the thoughts of the past couple days, and trying to wrap his mind around the mission he had accepted. *This force harvester must be majorly bad news for a Jedi to recruit a mandolorian to take down a weapon that seems to be focused on destroying the already depleted ranks of the remaining scattered Jedi.* Releasing the breath slowly he again clears his mind, forcing all thoughts from his mind he finds his center and lets himself drift in the void for what seems like a few moments to him but in reality is about an hour or so.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 10:06:13)

**"C'mon you little monster… bah! Nevermind,"** he says to Tentia with a grin, then turns to Ka'ra, **"Well, while out a' wandering I saw a advert for swoop racing, and seeing as how the Hutt's run this rock there are bound to be other ways to turn a credit. I'm willing to bet there'll be a payout to the first two to three placers and no limit betting on the side. Care to watch a race lass?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 10:09:55)

Ka'ra gives a laugh as Tentia scampers away with its treat. "**Sure, could be fun. Might even put in a couple bets myself**" Her thoughts goes to the bike. "**You're not going to race on that are you?**" she nudges her head back toward the cargo hold where you're bike is stored.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 10:25:18)

**"Listen here lass, that old bike is far more than she appears. Very maneuverable, she is. No, she can't handle drag races but she's more than capable on round tracks and obstacle courses. Besides, do you have a better idea? Should I ride Tentia?"** he asks with wink, **"Bring along the Ithorian, who knows maybe he can use the Force to predict the outcome of the race, eh?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 11:23:19)

Ka'ra giggles at the thought of Tanith riding Tentia. "**I would like to see you try. I'd pay to see that sight.**" Looking up the ladder she says, "**We can talk more about this in the morning I guess… It's been a long day.**" With that she puts her foot on the first rung of the ladder, ready to climb up.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 11:33:08)

**"As you wish, lass. After you,"** Tanith replies, following her up and enjoying the view as long as he can, armor or no. *I may be old, but I'm not dead. Not yet, anyway,* he thinks. After reaching his cabin he strips off his armor and cleans it before laying down for some much needed sleep.

---

### **jwol** (2010-07-15 11:56:59)

Calmly taking one final deep breath Tendau opens his eyes. *Even the Jedi cannot function forever without sleep* he thinks.
Standing and stretching the ithorian looks around his new room and upon locating the bed moves towards it and lays down.
After settling in for the night, Tendau decides to rest until awoken by one of the other crew members.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 12:39:03)

Ka'ra grins at Tanith as she looks down the ladder at him and with a shake of her head jumps up to the top. "Jate'ca," she says with a small wave as she reaches her door and opens it. Tentia follows behind Tanith having half flown have jumped up the ladder. The Strill moves past the man, rubbing against his legs as it passes. The door to Ka'ra's room closes behind the creaure
The next morning Ka'ra is up early, working on making breakfast. Having not yet dressed in her armor, she wears her usual civvies of slacks and tank, she's busy at work flipping a flat cake on the makeshift griddle. Tentia watches the motions with great interest from a couple feet away. Ka'ra speaks quietly to the Strill in an amused tone in her own tongue.
<span style="font-size: 0.80em;">***[ Post made via Mobile Device ]***</span>

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-15 14:27:54)

Tanith wakes feeling well rested and hungry, mostly due to the smells coming from down the hall. He showers quickly and gears up, tucking his helmet through his belt. As he makes his way to the lounge he knocks on Tendau's door, calling out, **"Rise and shine Tendau! Soups on!"**
Tanith fixes a pot of caf and installs the shield into the slot vacated by his charger, which he places in his utility belt. As he enters he says, **"Morning Ka'ra. Sleep well? I've knocked on the Ithorian's door, he should be joining us shortly."** While working on his armor he looks to Tentia with a grin, **"And how are you this morning, slobber dispenser?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-15 19:46:04)

Tentia gives Tanith a large yawn and goes back to watching Ka'ra flip the flatcakes in the skillet. Stacking a few onto a plate she puts it on the table for Tanith. Already there is a small jar of syrup which smells similar to the uj cake she shared with him earlier. "**Good, if he doesn't come out soon I think Tentia might eat all the flatcakes.**" With Ka'ra's back turned Tentia sneaks up to the counter, and after a backwards glance at Ka'ra, expertly swipes the top two cakes from the stack leaving a slobbery mess on top.
"**Osi'kyr, wayii!**" Ka'ra starts, turning around to spot Tentia trying to snatch another mouthful. "**Slana'pir!**" she adds pointing to the hallway, obviously indicating she wanted the Strill out. Tentia's ears go back, hurt over the rebuttal, but it only finishes swiping the last of the flat cakes Ka'ra had made before running for the hallway. Grumbling, Ka'ra absently places a stray strand of her red hair behind an ear and goes back to the stove pouring more of the batter into the skillet.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-20 00:06:23)

**"HA!"** Tanith comes close to dropping his tools laughing at the strill's antics and disregard of the Mandalorian's anger. **"Careful there, little one, there's reason to fear Mandos, eh?"** he says to Tentia as it leaves.
He finishes installing his shield and pours syrup over his flatecakes, **"Lass, if you keep cooking like this my joke about a proposal may become a reality,"** he says as he digs in after pouring himself a fresh cup of caf.
**"If he doesn't get up soon, does that mean I get his flatcakes? I'll wrestle Tentia for 'em, if need be,"** he says with a grin after finishing the first few of the flatcakes.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-20 12:38:40)

With a flick of her wrist she tosses the flatcake into the air to land on its other side in the skillet. Ka'ra gives a soft laugh. "**If this impresses you, then you should have my sister Malena's cooking. She's far better at this than I am.**" Looking back at Tanith she gives him a teasing grin. "**I could introduce you if you want.**" Picking up the skillet again she tips it over the plate, tossing the finished flatcake on top before going to work on another one. She works on a few more and sets herself up with her own plate splitting the last batch she made in half and brings them to the table.
Setting one plate in front of the chair beside her she sits down with the other. "**I'm sure Tendau will be up soon. He's probably doing whatever it is Jedi do in the morning.**" she says jokingly, pouring the syrup on top of the cakes.

---

### **jwol** (2010-07-20 14:22:40)

Yawning with both his mouths Tendau stretches his arms and legs as long as they will go and stands up.
*Wow, that felt like an eternity* he thinks. With that he leaps from the bunk and gets himself ready for the day. Adjusting his robes properly and putting his utility belt and saber back on he puts back on his outer cloak to fully cover his weapon. Letting another big yawn escape his mouths he notices the sweet smell of flat cakes drifting into his room.
Feeling his stomach grumble and realizing he has probably already over slept greatly, he opens the door to his cabin and makes his way towards to mess hall.
**Good morning Ka'ra, Tanith,** and looking at the strill **and of course Tentia.** Moving around the table to an open seat he pulls it out and sits himself down. **My apologies, it appears these weeks of travel since leaving the herdship have been much more taxing than I had realized. But fear not I am ready in any capacity you may need me.**
Looking at the flatcakes the Ithorian asks, **May I?**

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-20 15:17:34)

Tanith nods at the Ithorian amicably as he comes in, far too busy enjoying his breakfast to actually speak. At Ka'ra's quip about her sister he assumes a mocking look of hurt, then winks at her, both of which are much funnier due to the overfull mouth which was his intention.
After his plate is cleared of food, he looks around, seeming lost before sighing and looking to the newest crew member, **"G'morning Tendau. Tell me, do you like racing?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2010-07-20 17:24:54)

The young unarmored woman indicates the plate in front of the empty chair beside her giving him a kindly smile. The seventeen year olds piercing blue eyes look at Tendau with good humor as he sits. "**We were about to give you up as lost.**" She passes over the half filled jar of syrup,setting it down with a slight thump next to his plate. "**Hmm.. running low on uj'ayl**," she comments dolefully.
"**I think you would find my sister quite pleasing Tanith**," she teases. "**Not only does she have a good hand in the kitchen, but she's also quite taken by pilots.**" She grins at him before taking a bite of her food to hide it.
Between small mouthfuls of flatcake she explains to Tendau. "**We'll be staying here for at least another day. Tanith wants to try his skill at the local swoop races.**"

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-20 17:31:15)

**"Well of course she does, lass, all girls love pilots. It's a rule. Why do you think I don't mind risking my life flying, eh?"** he says grinning as he eyes Tendau's flatcakes. **"Does your sister share your looks? And more importantly, does she own ships as nice as these?"** he adds as he fixes himself more caf. He gestures with the pot at Tendau and asks, **"Caf, Tendau?"**

---

### **jwol** (2010-07-21 02:24:59)

**Thank you Tanith, a good cup of Caf is just what I need to undull my senses.** Grinning at the pilot he feels his cup to the brim and puts it back in his right mouth while simultaneously pushing a flatcake into his left mouth.
After chewing and and swallowing he looks at the pilot and winks. **The benefit of my anatomy friend.** Grinning he continues to devour the hotcakes.
Taking in the information about the races and pondering Tanith's earlier question the Ithorian looks at Ka'ra and says, **If our mission allows the time I say we take the recreational time while we can, if it is as bad as you say, we won't see much in the future.** Looking back over to the pilot, **As for racing, it was never my sport,** after a brief pause and a hearty chuckle the jedi continues **but I can see for those who have the talent how it can be quite…. sporting, It would be a pleasure to watch you race against some of the locals, from what I've seen they can be rather brutish.** Chuckling again he continues to decimate the plate in front of him.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-21 09:00:36)

**"Then its decided! Today I show you two how to make a great deal of credits, eh?"** Tanith says, thoroughly cheered at the prospect. He finishes washing up his dishes and the ones used to cook, doing so in an obviously militaristic manner, before leaving the room and calling behind him, **"I'll be in the hold prepping the bike when you two are ready."**
Once down the ladder he unloads the bike, then goes over it with a fine toothed comb, making sure it's in top condition for the coming stresses.

Ka'ra watches as he leaves. "**Tion'jor dush gane kar'tay?**" she asks herself. Turning her attention back to the Ithorian she says "**We're not expected to arrive on Telia for another couple days and at least here you won't be, uh, twiddling your thumbs in boredom,**" she says with a great deal of humor. Getting up she pours herself a glass of the juice to take with her back to her room."**We better get ready, I doubt Tanith will wait for us for long.**"
Not long in getting ready, she meets Tanith by his bike, a light thigh length jacket covers her tank and the top of her blaster pistol holstered at her hip. Visible under her coat is the bracer computer she normally has on her gauntlet and combat gloves in place of those. Watching with some interest as he finishes checking over the bike in great detail she can't seem to help but to say, "**Mirdi gar gana jaro, ner vod.**" With a shake of her head she adds, "**I think you have a death wish, friend.**"
Tanith manages to find several loose wires in his close inspection of his speeder and then goes about fine tuning his speeder's engines, having almost taken the whole thing apart and putting it back together in the short time.

**"Ner vod, eh? Friend? I thought you Mandos didn't have friends. Just the Mando'ade and Aruetii,"** he replies with a wink to take any sting out of the comment as he finishes bolting on the left maneuvering vane.
Finished with the bike he straightens and pulls on his helmet, mounts the bike, and begins powering it up, **"As for the bike: it's not what you fly lass, it's how you fly it, eh? And besides, unless you're willing to buy me another it's all I have. Considering you still haven't given me the other five hundred credits and have alluded to not giving me that or anythin' else, if you were to front the credits to buy one I may get upset, heh!"**

Watching his companions depart to the hold, Tendau heads back to his quarters to grab his other canteen. Heading to the Refresher station he fills it water and attaches it to his belt. *If we're going to be out in this heat, it will be worth making sure we're hydrated at least.*
After securing the extra canteen to his belt he places his ear piece comlink in and heads down to meet the others in the hold. Upon arriving and seeing Tanith working on the bike he leans against the bulk head until the inspection is done, not wanting to interrupt the man and cause him to miss something that could be disastrous. After seeing him finish the overhaul of the speederbike the Ithorian comments, **I am ready when you are, hopefully the force will guide your hands today my friend.** With that and a hearty chuckle Tendau makes ready to follow his companions to wherever they deem the racing prospects best.

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-21 13:27:35)

**"I never turn down help, friend Tendau, but I'll trust my hands. They've served me well and kept me alive, eh? Now, if you want to look at the boards and use your Force to predict who will finish where and let us bet accordingly, that would be most welcome,"** the humor in his voice carries through the helmet from long years of practice.
**"I believe there's a speeder rental kiosk just outside the port here, I'll wait for the two of you there,"** he says as he eases on the thrusters. Even at minimum power he quickly pulls away from the two. Once he reaches the kiosk he powers down and consults the information kiosk next to it for race times, entrance fees, number of racers so far, and the current odds and favorites of the race.

---

### **jwol** (2010-07-21 15:37:39)

Nodding at the departing pilot, Tendau turns to Ka'ra and says  **Looks like we'll need to rent a speeder or flag down a ride.**
Looking around the port the Ithorian searches for a convient way to reach the racing kiosks.  **So, which method of travel seems to peak your interest Ka'ra?**  Tendau asks with a shrug of his wide robed shoulders.

Tanith finds the information booth doesn't have all the information readily availble. Showing only a schedule of events, it manages to inform him of the time of the next race which will be that day starting in the late afternoon. Apparently the rest of the information you will have to find out at the Swoop Range proper.
Ka'ra begins to make her way toward the boarding ramp, glancing behind her to speak to her Strill companion. The Strill for it's part has its ears back and then runs off toward the upper level. "**As far as I know, we won't need a speeder to get there…**" Taking the final steps off the ramp she enters down her lockdown code as the ramp closes behind Tendau and Ka'ra. "**Osi'kyr**," she says, lifting up on the collar of her jacket in an attempt to fan herself. "**I never realized how hot it was here.**"
Steering her course for the speeder rental Tanith headed towards she asks Tendau with a sidelong glance. "**I've heard Ithorians don't like the heat… Is that true?**"

**My people are from a temperate world, not a dust bowl like this one. While my self I have traveled greatly during my training and the wars, I have never been fond of these abhorently dry worlds. Even though in the cliffs and under the sand it is teeming with life I always feel like these worlds are so barren and dead.**  Shrugging non commitally the Ithorian strides off in the direction the soon to be racer had traveled in.

Cursing fluently in Huttese about the heat, Tanith turns from the kiosk to check on the progress of his fellows. He then turns to eye the area around him, specifically the road to the track, curious as to what shops and cantinas are in the area. He tries to judge the distance to the track, then checks the prices at the speeder rental kiosk. *Mayhap its close enough to not warrant a speeder, but in this heat I doubt it,* he thinks.

### **Alicia** (2010-07-27 09:08:56)

The information terminal does of course have a map of the Anchorhead settlement, which it proudly sports one cantina, a bounty guild, Czerka recruitment office and a headquarters, and a droid and mechanics shop, general store, as well as a variety of other shops. The entire settlement has been built behind a massive wall which serves to protect it from the fickle Tusken Raiders. There are three gates with the one missing due to the presence of the spaceport on that side, which is also where you noticed the wall is the strongest.
Ka'ra and Tendau aren't long in joining Tanith at the information terminal and speeder rental. Having found it to hot for her jacket she had stripped it off and was carrying it over one arm. Signs of a sheathed knife attached to her forearm could be seen by a close observer sticking out from underneath the jacket. Approaching the kiosk she looks over the list of available speeders, speaking to the owner getting a rental price for a couple two seater. The clerk stated a price nearly triple what it would normally cost. "**Insurance**!" The clerk replies when Ka'ra asks him why they prices are so high. "**Get you tourists all the time, looking to try your hand at racing or on safari. Sand on this world makes maintenance necessary more frequently too and the technicians cost!**"
With a small sigh, Ka'ra passes over the credits for a days rental on a SoroSuub TT-6 Landspeeder and after being handed the ignition key is directed to the lot where it's stored. She returns to Tanith and passes over a credit chip. "**Here, this is what I owed you.**" is all she says and then she's off to retrieve her rented speeder in its questionable state.

---

### **jwol** (2010-07-27 14:12:47)

Upon reaching Tanith at the speeder kiosk, the Ithorian lets the human female lead. Upon hearing the prices for the rental of the speeder he realizes taking the backseat to Ka'ra may have been best, he would be barely able to afford such extortionist prices if left on his own.
As Tendau and Ka'ra approach their beat up transport the Jedi turns to ask, **Since we've acquired this speeder, as questionable as it may look, what is our next move Ka'ra?** Taking a look around to see if he can see which way Tanith is he looks back to the mandolorian, **And Do we know which way these races are located? If they are a long way off it may be worth taking some respite from the sun in the cantina until Tanith's race.**
With that he unslungs his pack and throws it at his feet as he hops into the shot gun seat of the landspeeder.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-27 17:18:59)

Tanith takes the chip and checks its amount. When he finds it over what he was owed, he transfers five hundred to his own chip and leaves one hundred on the other. **"Hold a moment lass. Here, you gave too much,"** he says as he hands her back her chip, **"We've a few hours till the race, how'd you like to spend them? I've a mind to see the shops myself. Visiting a cantina before a race has never worked out for me before, eh? Heh!"** Tanith will browse the droid and mechanics shops if nothing better is suggested.
((OOC looking for deals on droids and possibly upgrades for the bike, and any ship parts that are great deals

### **Alicia** (2010-07-27 18:14:41)

Ka'ra looks down at the chip not making any indication she was going to take it back. "**Consider it my contribution to the race then**," she says, turning away to jump into the speeder. "**A race you haven't even entered yet, mind you. Shouldn't you go see who your compeition is and make sure your entry is secured?**" She shrugs as she waits for Tendau to join her. "**After that we can decide how we will waste our time.**"
Insering the ignition key, the speeder's engine takes a moment to even out. Under her breath she mutters several choice curse words in her own langauge.
"**Go ahead and head over, I think I want something to drink,"** she says before she revs the speeder's engine into motion and takes off over the dust covered streets toward the cantina. At first she hits the accelerator, testing the limits of how fast the speeder could actually go. As she nears the settlement proper she slows down to a more manageable speed and its not long before she's parked it outside the cantina. Gracefully climbing out, she takes a moment to put her jacket back on, for a moment fully revealing the knife she has within easy reach on her forearm.
"**Shall we?**" asks Tendau, before she starts for the entrance to the cantina where he had first approached her. Instead of making for a table she heads to the bar.
As she waits for the bartender she absently taps her fingers on the fake wood veneer of the bar. Finally with the bartender's attention she asks sweetly in with a perfect Coruscant accent. "**Correllian ale and a jawa juice, please.**" The bartendes looks as if he's about to refuse her request for an ale, but finally he sets the two drinks in front of her. After paying for the drinks she turns to find where her Ithorian companion went to.
-------------------------------------------------
The racing office is on the far side on the outskirts of the settlement from the spaceport. Not suprisingly its not too far from the cantina or from the bounty hunter's guild. Outside the door, several would be pilots wait, having their bikes inspected by a couple race certified techinicians.
Inside you are greeted by a rust colored protocol droid "**Greeting sentient, where may I direct you?**" To the side a terminal is visible through a couple Duros.

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-27 18:28:08)

**"Eh? Lass, you may be comfortably well off, but you don't stay that way by being foolish and giving away credits,"** he replies as she pulls off. As she guns the engine he listens to the racket and cringes, *That bucket will cost her even more before it's all said and done.*
Outside the office he looks over the technician's work, hoping they weren't too corrupt or at least good enough at their work to not be blatant about it. He eyes the other racers subtly, and takes pains to make his bike look more the way Ka'ra already saw it: like a hunk of junk. He kills the thrust early, feathers the repulsors, and lets the engine choke off. All rookie pilot mistakes, or the result of faulty equipment.
He walks into the office and eyes the surroundings, peering over towards the Duros and their screen. **"Greetings. I need to know the requirements for entry, and I'd like to know the number of racers; that or I need to see the race coordinator. They don't provide oil baths here, eh?"** Tanith asks, not bothering to take off his helm, reasoning he would be heading out again soon.

### **jwol** (2010-07-28 07:48:14)

Seeing Ka'ra turn around with the drinks Tendau waves at her as she scans the crowd for their table. Upon seeing that she is on her way back the ithorian takes a moment to scan the assembled motly crew of cantina deziens. Seeing nothing out of the ordinary, or at least nothing to cause concern he returns his gaze to the young mandolorian who by this time has arrived with their drinks at the table.  **Well I must say, the crowd certainly hasn't improved much since last night.**  Chuckling softly to himself he takes another brief scan of the crowd, his instincts always searching for threats, most likely being the reason for his survival of the Jedi Civil War. Again with his eyes returning to his human companion,  **So after the races then what? If this mission is as imperative as it sounds, we should be on our way soon I believe, I have a sense of impending danger and believe it will only increase the longer we delay.**  Lingering a moment to let Ka'ra contemplate his words he takes a draw from the jawa juice she had presented him with upon arriving at the table.

The droid cocks its head at the statement that it doesn’t get the oil baths it needs. “**Our administrator services us perfectly well.**” It retorts and then stands up straighter as it recites in an official tone. “**I’m most sorry, sentient, but we are no longer taking applications for today’s race. Bidding is however still open for the current lineup until the race is scheduled to start. Please have a pleasant day.**” The droid apparently pleased in its speech and concluding nothing else was to be said moves on to further assist the others in the office.
Ka’ra approaches the table Tendau has occupied, moving gracefully with the two drinks in hand. Setting them down she takes the seat opposite him. Still using the same Coruscant accent she used with the bartender she replies, “**I figure we’ll enjoy what free time we’ll have.**” Taking a sip she makes a small face of displeasure over the taste of the ale.” **Lanius won’t be back for another few days regardless and it would be best if we showed up after him.**” Looking toward the other patrons she seems to survey the crowd, sizing them up before her gaze returns to the Ithorian. “**I owe Tanith, so a few hours diversion so he can race won’t cost us that much.**”

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-03 15:17:31)

Tanith resists the urge to mouth off at the droid, reasoning it probably doesn't understand 'snarky' or jokes for that matter. *Anyroad, I'm ready to be gone from this dustball,"* he thinks as he leaves the office and heads for his bike. He doesn't bother with the deception when he cranks the bike and takes off, he simply leaves. Once he arrives at the cantina he locks down the bike and wanders inside, glancing over the room looking for his companions as he makes his way to the bar. **"Whiskey, Corelian,"** he tells the bartender as he spots the lass and the Ithorian. After he receives his drink he wanders over, **"Damned race is full, just as well though. Folks like these tend to lose poorly, eh?"**

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-03 16:48:28)

Taking a sip of his juice and looking at the pilot as he sits down the Ithorian responds, **Most people with little to lose, respond well to losing the small am mount they do have. It may be for the best that you were not able to enter the races. I know I have had enough hasty exits from places before that if we can avoid burning a bridge in one place it may be useful if we need to lay low on a backwater world such as this.** Sipping his juice again the jedi shifts slightly uncomfortable with the dryness of the world and thankful for the cool refreshments. Looking over at Ka'ra, Tendau inquires, **Well now that we know his diversion is not to be what is our next move young one?** Leaving the question hanging in the air, he again scans the crowd for anything out of the ordinary, trusting his connection to the force to reveal anything that may be an incoming threat.

### **Alicia** (2010-08-03 19:38:50)

Ka'ra pats Tanith on the shoulder in consolation when he says he won't be entering the race. Turning her attention back to Tendau she too takes another sip of her ale. "**I suppose we could stay and place some bets, but I never was one for gambling. Our destination is about a two days burn from here.**" With a shrug she adds, "**We have a day to waste if we want or we can make it there early.**"
Nothing unusual is to be seen in the crowd, though not as rowdy as the one last night, some of the clientèle starts to clear out as the race draws near. The bartender moves over to a radio of sorts to put on the commentary for those patrons who decided to stay. One adventurous sort starts going around taking bets.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-03 20:38:59)

**"Its always been my experience that the decent ones with little to lose don't bet, eh? The rest, well, they either deserve to lose or have enough to lose. Besides, I don't just fly for the women. Ha! Without piloting I have no control over the outcome, so I have no reason to stay on this dust bucket of a planet,"** Tanith says with a laugh. He tosses back his whiskey and sets the glass on the counter, then says, **"I vote we dust off, pun intended. Heh! What say you lass? Tendau?"**

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-04 10:32:03)

Looking over to Tanith the Ithorian puts down the rest of his Jawa Juice in a final satisfying swig. **From my experiences lingering in a place unnecessarily is unwise. I agree with Tanith, we should move on soon, so as to be fully ready once we arrive.** Looking over to Ka'ra the jedi nods to her looking for her input.
Shifting slightly again trying to get his pack in a more comfortable place Tendau finally just stands so he can right the unruly pack. *Stupid thing is always in the way he thinks.*
**I am ready when you are,** looking over to Ka'ra he chuckles softly to himself **and especially you, I don't want to have to walk back in this heat by my self.** Grinning broadly with both mouths he chuckles softly again and waits patiently to follow the young mandolorian to the waiting speeder.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-08-04 10:39:56)

Ka'ra gives a noncommittal shrug as she takes another sip of her drink. "**You're the pilot, Tanith. If you want to leave, let's go.**" she says continuing her ruse with the Coruscant accent. She turns to look as the broker comes around toward your table.
"**Bets anyone? Got the best rate in town. Kline the Dug is at the top of his game, he's a likely winner for this coming race.**" The broker put his hand on Ka'ra's shoulder and then just as quickly takes it away as she sends him what would only be considered a death glare.
"**We were just leaving,**" she says slowly in the adopted accent, standing along with Tandau.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-04 10:49:42)

**"Piss off little one. I won't pull the lass off you if you manage to make her angry, eh? Besides, that Dug wouldn't know competition if it bit him on the rear,"** Tanith tells the broker as he wanders towards the door. *What's with the accent?* he wonders, deciding to wait till safely out of common earshot before asking.
Once outside he unlocks his bike and fires it up, then waits for Ka'ra to start the speeder. Once they are on their way he follows, then leaves them to return the speeder while he packs his own on board. After doing so he heads on up to the cockpit and begins his preflight checklist.

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-04 11:09:31)

Tendau follows Ka'ra out of the cantina and hops into the front seat of the speeder. **Well we might as well take it easy for the trip over to meet your friend, Ka'ra.** The ithorian says as he swings his unruly pack to his feet. *Sithspawn of a device.* The young Jedi thinks as he kicks his pack slightly to show his displeasure with it.
As Ka'ra goes to park the speeder at the rental shop Tendau hops out and puts his pack back on and waits patiently for her to converse with the attendant at the lot. When she approaches he inquires, **Are we headed back to ship now sentient?**

---

### **Alicia** (2010-08-04 20:44:22)

Ka'ra leaves her ale only half drunk and with a glare at the broker as he moves off to the next table of patrons heads for the door. Jumping into the driver's seat so starts the speeder with a whirl and cough of the engines. "**Hunk of junk**," she mutters while the engine turns over. It's not long after that she's speeding away leading Tanith on his speeder back to the space port. While he heads to the *Atin Oya'ka*, Ka'ra begins some negotiations with the rental clerk.
Rejoining the Ithorian Jedi, there's a smirk on her face. "**Yes… Not much else to do out here except bake.**" With a laugh at her bad joke she sets a steady pace back to the cruiser. Boarding the ship she waits for Tendau to follow behind her before she closes the ramp behind him.
Tentia is waiting in the hold and bombards Ka'ra as soon as she turns around from the ramp console. "**Su cuy'gar striil'ika. Gar taylir be'chaaj teh buruk?**" she coos at it, scratching it under its chin. In response it, bounds away a few steps, prances in a circle and takes off out of the cargo hold. Ka'ra grins after it but doesn't follow instead moving around the hold to make sure all the crates are secure. "**You'll like where we're going I think, much better than Tattooine. Solsis V is more temperate, covered by jungles and water**," she says between testing the restraints on the few crates remaining in the hold. She's back to what you can only assume is her natural form of speaking, though consider how fluent she was in maintaining the Coruscant accent, it's hard to tell.

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-04 21:43:26)

**Understandable dear.**  The ithorian says as he checks his utility belt and saber. Shifting slightly he looks at the young human and goes about helping her secure the cargo in the hold.
When everything is secure he follows her to the habitable levels and secures himself and his belongings for travel to their intended destination.

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-05 04:44:49)

Tanith sits finishing up his preflight check when the indicator light shows the exterior hatch closing. He ticks off the last few items on the list, taking a few moments to let the others get settled. As he engages the engines he keys up what passes for spaceport control on this backwater, letting them know they were lifting off and making sure to give them the same information Ka'ra gave them on arrival. After he receives clearance conformation he lifts off, gently manipulating the thrusters on low power and feathering the repulsors for an even, turbulence free ascent.
The only showmanship applied to the take off is its efficiency and ease. He still acts slightly younger than his years from time to time, but he knows how to show real skill. Before leaving the atmosphere he engages the shields and puts the weapon systems on standby, then after reaching orbit warms up the navicomputer. He keys up the ship's internal com and says, **"Welcome and thanks for traveling Hoagra Spaceways! Please make yourselves comfortable, or at least be quiet, and don't forget to tip the pilot, eh? Heh! Lass, I can't get us there if I don't know where there is. We'll be there in two shakes of Tentia's…. well whatever, as soon as I do."**

---

### **Alicia** (2010-08-06 00:02:16)

Pulling on the last of the straps she cocks her head as she feels and hears the gentle whine of the engines straining as they fight against the planet's gravity. There's not further indication in the fact that they had just now left Tattooine. "**Jate dinui**" she says as she listens. "**I knew there was a reason I hired him….**"
Upon Tanith's flight communication she shakes of her head and grins at Tendau, amused by her pilot's antics. Ka'ra makes her way to the cockpit and takes a seat in the copilot's seat she plugs in the coordinates for their next destination. "**I think Tentia would be most appreciative of the fact you're using it to tell time**," she jokes as she punches in the last equation.
Leaning back she waits for the jump to lightspeed. "**Now hopefully you two can refrain from injuring yourselves… We'll be in lightspeed for a day and a half at least.**"

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-06 00:34:01)

**"Sith spit, really?"** Tanith asks as he removes his helmet, **"I'll just have to find away to amuse myself then, eh?"** he winks as he says it, then reaches for the lightspeed controls. *Damn. That one didn't get filtered at all did it? Lass is affecting me more than I thought,* he thinks, trusting his manner and voice to save him from the wrath as it has so far. As the stars lengthen to streaks he leaves behind the flirting and takes the conversation to other things. **"So what's with the shifting accent?"** he asks, thinking, *Not many can spot a Mando accent. So why change it when you're out of armor?*

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-06 13:04:49)

Tendau wanders slowly to his quarters once the cargo hold is secured. Looking around he places his accursed travel pack down in his storage chest and removes his outer cloak. Sighing softly he walks over to hang his cloak on a chair and moves towards the cockpit.
Upon arriving at the cockpit the ithorian takes a seat behind Tanith's chair. Coming in at the tail end of the conversation he catches the pilots remark about the mandolorian's shifting accents. **I must say Ka'ra, I too was interested to know about your changing accents.**
Taking in his surroundings as he begins to relax for the first time since they had left the ship earlier in the day he takes in the beauty of the swirling elongated look of the galaxy while traveling through hyperspace. **Its beautiful.** The jedi says softly and more to himself than to his two companions.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-08-06 13:19:20)

Ka'ra shrugs and for a long moment she sits watching the stars go past, "**I spent a year on Coruscant with my aunt during the war. People found me less threatening with something familiar. Just sort of stuck.**" She glances over at Tanith and then at Tendau.
"**My armor may be unique, but anyone who has seen the crusader armor up close will still see similarities… Much as you two did. It can cause some problems and is easy to remember. When in public without my armor I try to keep a low profile. Rarely does anyone associate my presence with the troublesome and often unwelcome Mando.**" She shrugs again. "**The distinction often helped in the past when I was looking for my mark.**"

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-06 14:49:47)

**That does make much sense Ka'ra and I can understand why you would wish to take precautions, these are turbulent times we live in.** Shifting about to get more comfortable in his seat he takes a deep breath and closes his eyes for a few moments before opening them and shifting his gaze back to Ka'ra he quickly amends his previous statement. **Forgive me young one if I spoke out of turn, I did not mean to offend, it was merely a curiosity to myself. If I spoke out of turn I hope you can look past my callous question.**
Fidgeting slightly in his chair again he returns to gazing at the view port of the cockpit.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-08-06 15:57:53)

Ka'ra graces Tendau with a smile as she swivels the seat so she can look at her human and Ithorian companions equally. "**I'm not offended**." With a glance out the viewport she adds. "**I'm not ashamed of who I am, but I do like to avoid trouble when I can these days.**"

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-06 16:13:21)

**Now that I can understand.** Hefting his lightsaber off of his belt in his left hand.  **All to well. My own kind with recent events have had many mixed feelings, and it can be difficult for some to understand the tragedies and difficulties the recent conflicts produced.**  Shifting his attention back from his saber to Ka'ra he reclips the elegant weapon back to his belt and nods to her amicably.

**"Yes, my friend, yes it is,"** Tanith replies after seeing the Ithorian looking out the view port. He listens to there conversation while busying himself with the readouts, checking over the course and making sure the hyperdrive was functioning properly.
*Her marks must be something special then. I'd never have noticed the Mando accent with out her speaking the language and wearing the armor,* he thinks as she explains, *Of course, without the armor she could have easily taken you for all you had Tanith, you fool. Had she left the damned helmet on you may have even been smart enough to walk away from this Jedi orchestrated suicide run, eh?* he finishes berating himself in his thoughts about the time Tendau mentions 'tragedies and difficulties the recent conflicts.' *Uhg, not a conversation I care to be present for. Jedi views didn't make sense during the wars, they damned sure won't now,* he thinks to himself.
He stands and moves towards the cockpit exit after setting the alarms to his com code. **"I'll be checking over the systems for regular maintenance and seeing what can be improved. I've got the console rigged to set off my com if anything goes wrong. Just yell really loud if you need me, eh?"** he says with a grin as he moves to leave.

Ka'ra only has a nod to give to Tanith and Tendau as she proceeds to stare out the view port for a few more minutes. Seeming to enjoy the peace she doesn't attempt to draw the Ithorian into any sort of conversation. After several long minutes, she stands and leaves the cockpit heading toward her cabin.
(( Question for you two. Do you wish to continue doing some RPing for during the journey or skip right to arriving on Solsis? Might be a good idea for your characters to get some time to RP with each other. So here's your chance. ))

Tendau watches the others leave the cockpit as he finds himself seeing distant planets and places in his mind, all while seeming to gaze upon the stars.
The ghosts of past can haunt even the most hardened soldier, and the Ithorian had seen his fair share of death and destruction. *The failures of his order had caused much harm in the recent past and hopefully*, he thought to himself, *those remaining of my kind can help to heal the harm we caused*.
Taking in a deep breath he comes back to the present and realizes he is sitting alone in the cockpit with the dazzling show of streaking stars during lightspeed swirling around him as the ship hurtled towards their destination. Taking in a second deep breath Tendau starts to realize the pain and mistrust he has been seeing in Tanith's demeanor whenever his lightsaber or his order start to become the focus of conversation.
*Obviously this man has seen the same warfare I have,* he ponders, *and not having the same basis of understanding of our principals he must be even more confused and wary of the remaining jedi than I am at what has transpired these last dark years.*
Standing up from his comfortable perch in the cockpit Tendau moves with purpose through the ship to locate Tanith and his maintenance to see if he could offer a hand and possibly break through to the man, at least for friendship, if not for his better understanding of what they obviously both had been part of.
Upon finding Tanith the jedi states, **Good evening friend, do you mind if I give you a hand with the maintenance? I was hoping to get to better know you as we will be traveling together for the foreseeable future.** With that the ithorian waits patiently for a reply smiling with both his mouths amicably.

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-08 00:47:14)

Tanith jumps and cracks his head on the bulkhead near the sub-light engines, **"Gah! Oh, Tendau. Ha! Tentia has me a touch jumpy, eh? The little slobber dispenser has been enjoying proving it can be quiet, right before dispensing the slobber,"** he replies, rubbing the spot on his head.
**"Handy with a hydrospanner are you? I hope so. I thought I was before coming on board and having the lass show me up with some delicate wiring, heh! These engines seem in decent shape. Lets see what the ship's computer can tell us about the state of things,"** he says as he moves towards the lower-deck console and runs a basic diagnostic and queries the last maintenance logs.

**Well not so much a hydrospanner as a medkit or botany, but I learn quickly and am pretty good with fetching… The right tool you may need that is.**  Grinning and chuckling the ithorian meanders his way over to Tanith and the computer screen to see what his and the ships prognossis of its' state of afairs are.

**"Heh, that means your light-years ahead of Tentia when it comes to usefulness. I know the little grubber understands me, but it just looks at me then does something else,"** Tanith replies as he pecks away at the console. **"Ah, here we go. Let's see what this log says…..Damned things in Mando'a, I think it is anyway. Hold on…. there,"** with a few extra keystrokes the screen displays a series of logs in basic. He keys up the most recent ten and scans them for any variety.
**"Most of this seems pretty much milk run material. Just hasn't been done in months. Have to talk to the lass about that. No I won't, that's why she brought me in, eh? Heh. Clever girl. Anyroad, we'll start with calibrating the turrets and move towards the ramp, checking the systems as we go, then move on to the upper level, what d'you say?"** he says as he checks his utility belt for his toolkit. **"You don't have a datapad handy do you? If not the lass should have one laying around here somewhere. Need to upload this list so we'll have something to check off against, keep from running back and forth to the damned console."**

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-09 12:24:43)

**Unfortunately my friend I do not have one in my supplies. Most of my gear is designed for roughing it in the wilderness or for easy contact on a mission, like my earpiece comlink.**  Looking around Tendau attempts to locate a datapad that may have been discarded when the repairs and maintenance were done last. Upon not locating one in easy reach or view the ithorian turns back to The human and replies,  **Well I do not see one in easy reach Tanith, I think we should ask Ka'ra to borrow one. I'll follow your lead through the repairs.**  And with that the young Jedi makes to follow the veteran pilot to the captain and then on to the first set of tasks set before them.

**"Bah, to hell with it. Weapon systems, engines, hyperdrive, shield generators, and landing gear are on this level; life support, navi-comp, ship's comp, communications, and all the controls are on the next, mostly in the cockpit. We'll just do the basics for each, then log it afterwards,"** he replies, not wanting to bother the lass. *She seems distracted, and not wanting much company. Were she male I'd offer to get her drunk, but I don't think she'd go for that solution,* he thinks.
He walks towards the turrets and flips open the diagnostic panel and begins tinkering. **"Seeing as how you aren't that technically minded I imagine you have other reasons for volunteering to help, eh?"**

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-10 07:31:44)

**Aye, I was hoping we could talk a bit as we worked. A well oiled machine works best.** Chuckling the ithorian grabs the tool chest and begins to follow Tanith.  **I know we have some unpleasant shared memories, but before those dark days, where were you from?**  Upon inquiring about the pilots past the Jedi places the toolbox between them and inquires more casually,  **How are we looking Tanith?**

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-10 08:04:33)

**"Well, I was born on Corellia, but I don't remember the planet. The folks and I moved around a bit. Before I turned sixteen I'd seen a fair piece of the Republic. Folks were merchants, see. There, weapons are fine. Lets move on to the shields,"** he says, reaching into the toolkit and taking out a tester before moving across the aisle to the shield generator and popping its access hatch.
**"At the ripe old age eighteen, I'd heard everything there was to hear about the Mando invasion. Naturally that meant I didn't know a damned thing. So I signed up with the Army. They needed more men than the Navy, eh? Mandos are a bloody horror on the ground, but in the vacuum the Republic could hold its own…"** he drifts off, it's difficult to tell if he's done so because of the generator or his memories.
He starts slightly, as if remembering where he is and what he's doing. **"Damn and double damn. That was ten years ago. I reckon I'm getting old, eh? Heh. And you friend Tendau? Anything interesting before the Jedi Academy?"** he asks, moving the tester to a different circuit and studying the readout.

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-10 16:03:55)

**Not so much before the academy, I was sent away from my family when I was very young. Although in recent years I have discovered several close relatives have been Jedi in the past. No alas most of my stories come from the years I spent growing up there, that and those gallavanting about the galaxy.** The ithorian shuffles out of Tanith's way and goes about holding open the panel for the pilot as he goes through his checklists.
Upon seeing that the human isn't being distracted by the banter the Jedi continues,  **Well I was too young for the mandolorian crusade, my master Dekel left me to complete my training…** Tendau too trails off, although it is unmistakeable that it is a tough subject to talk about. Clearing his voice the ithorian visably puts his thoughts back together and continues,  **Well after Dekel I travelled with Garrus, a bothan. He noticed my talents not only with the force but with the life sciences. Medicine and biology in particular. We were assigned to safeguard a few what seemed to be low risk medical facilities in the early days of the civil war.**  Again trailing off and losing his thoughts on how most of his happy memories seem to be mingled with grief.
 **I'm sorry my friend I don't mean to linger on those unhappy memories, it just seems that most of my pleasant ones seem to be intermingled with unpleasant ones. And if your old, I'm not too far behind you, I'm twenty four nearly twenty five! Besides if our pasts couldn't rob us of a future I doubt some milk run to meet a contact of Ka'ra's will.**  Chuckling again Tendau goes about assisting Tanith as best as he can with the maintenance.

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-11 02:41:14)

**"I've a feeling it'll try. My past did try to kill me regularly heh! I don't know, I believe the lass is mixed in with some rather bad things. I don't recognize either name, my battalion didn't see Jedi till later on in the war. The only Jedi I was around often was the General. My battalion ended up under her command there at the end. I even saw Revan once or twice, from a distance. During the Jedi Civil War there weren't many involved with the Navy, at least not with the Fighter Corps. Last one I remember was Vandarr. Heard rumors he was on board our carrier at the Battle of Rakata Prime. Saw several Jedi boarding troop carriers in the hanger at the beginning of that row, but none I knew by name,"** he continues while finishing up with the shields.
**"There, that's done. They're in top condition. We'll leave the hyperdrive till we drop back into realspace. Sublight engines next, eh?"** he says, swapping out testers and taking out a hydrospanner from the toolkit and moving down the hall a bit. He starts loosening the bolts on the engine casing, **"Brace it here, and here,"** he says, pointing at the corners of the plate. **"As I loosen it it can drop and get the bolts in a bind. Thanks."**

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-11 12:56:49)

**You were aboard Master Vandarr's ship? I was among the jedi boarding parties on board the same vessel at Rakata Prime.** The ithorian says as he braces where Tanith had pointed to. Shuffling his body out of the way so the pilot can get into the opened sublight engine space he pauses a moment while the human conducts the necessary scans. **I can understand why you did not see many jedi in the fighter squadrons, your training and the skills many of the pilots who survived up to the battle of Rakata Prime were nearly on par with those jedi who had chosen to fly combat missions during the civil war. Our abilities seem best put to use in close combat or at the very least in places where our skills can be adapted best to fit, such as surface battles and boarding parties.** Again pausing while the human goes about the maintenance the ithorian jedi continues again, **As for not knowing many by name, many of use were often assigned to groups only for very brief times, after a mission reassigning us as quickly as they could to where they felt we were needed most, as for Revan I had met him once at the temple, before he left for to halt the mandolorian crusades. He was deceptively charasmatic, and it is a wonder more of my kind didn't follow him.** Pausing for a moment with obvious glimpses of pain in his expression Tendau continues, **Unfortunately there are not man Jedi to get to meet presently, but I will say it has been a pleasure meeting you Tanith, hopefully we can continue to dodge the reaper and make a difference in the galaxy, I just hope we can do it with out leaving it in shambles as we have in the past.** With a deep breath the jedi stops and continues to hold open the engines for Tanith as he climbs back out when his repairs and maintenance are complete.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-11 23:25:11)

**"I hope so too, friend Tendau,"** Tanith replies as he finishes up the sublight engines. **"Alright, hold the panel back in place,"** he says as he moves to bolt the plate back on.
**"Many thanks. This is much quicker with a helping hand. All we have left on this level is the landing gear, and it won't take long, just a visual inspection. I can't test it fully till we hit atmosphere again. After that the upper level, most of which is looking over diagnostic logs for the systems and working the consoles in the cockpit. You can go through the medbay and life support systems, I don't know much about keeping flesh going, eh? Find any problems and I'll fix em up quick though,"** he states as he places the last of the bolts.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-08-12 09:03:04)

Finishing the maintenance, Tanith and Tendau move up the ladder to the upper deck and toward the forward section. Before Tendau can open the door to the infirmary Ka'ra opens it from within and jumps back slightly, startled. "**Oh, hey…**" she starts awkwardly. "**Keeping busy?**" she asks, looking between the two as Tanith begins to walk past heading for the cockpit.

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-12 14:18:19)

**Oh yes, we just finished the maintenance on the level below and Tanith was about about to move on to check the systems in the cockpit while I checked out the medbay's supplies and systems.** The ithorian states quickly while regaining his composure at being surprised by Ka'ra's sudden appearance in the medbay doorway. *Focus on the here and now* Tendau scolded himself. *Getting caught up in repairs or cataloging you may have to do should not detract from your focus, those types of things could get us all killed.* Sighing softly he looks over the young mandolorian intently.
**Any reason you were in the Medbay? If you were in need of medical assistance it does happen to be one of my specialties if you were to require assistance.**
(+14 UTF for observing if Ka'ra is in pain and requires medical assistance.)

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-13 03:40:39)

**"First rule to being a good pilot, lass: Never stop. If you do, you die, eh?"** Tanith replies with a wink as he moves into the common area, eying the nooks and crannies for Tentia. He stops and turns back to the others, having gone this far to avoid crowding the hall.
**"Anything specific you want looked at while I'm checking systems?"** he asks. **"The weapons, shields, and sublight engines have passed muster. I'll test the landing gear when we're in atmosphere again, and run diagnostics on the hyperdrive when we're docked. As Tendau said, I'm on the way to put the comp through its paces. Since he knows a bit more about life in general I was going to leave the life support to him,"** he finishes, his voice carrying the professionalism and ease of long practice and military experience.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-08-13 13:27:07)

Ka'ra moves to the side so Tendau can move into the medbay. The medbay is of a good size with a diagnostic table in good repair for use. In one corner you are surprised to see an empty bacta tank. "**No, I'm fine Tendau…**" she starts, apparently trying to think of an excuse for being here. "**I was just checking something.**" Glancing around Tendau doesn't see any obvious signs of her activities.
She moves into the hallway, joining Tanith in the common room. "**The ship was kept under good repair, I'll doubt you'll find much wrong with it. But thanks for going through the maintenance anyways. Let me know if you would like me to help.**" Turning she heads over to the kitchenette and starts making herself a cup of tea.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-13 14:21:49)

*What's the silly lass hiding now?* Tanith thinks as he watches her response to Tendau. *Hmmm. Could be anything in a medbay,* he mulls over it as he says, **"Nah, lass, that's why I'm here, eh? Tendau helped quite a bit, and I'll be done shortly,"** he says as he turns towards the cockpit.
**"Next time though lass, don't wait months before hiring a mechanic to look her over, eh? Either that or learn to keep a log,"** he says with a wink before passing from view. *Could be the spirits she mentioned earlier. I'd hide a bottle in a medbay, thats for damned sure,* he thinks as he enters the cockpit.
Once there, he proceeds with testing the ship's computer. He checks the various diagnostic logs, then runs a series of stress tests on the more failure-prone hardware. If he finds no problems he'll move on to the maneuvering jet controls.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-08-18 10:06:13)

Ka'ra looks behind her at Tanith as she finishes adding the tea to the mug of scalding water. "**I only acquired the ship last week,**" she says rising to her own defense. Taking a seat at the table she lets the two men go about their own business.
The next day passes without much incident, as long as you don't count Tanith and Tentia both going into a frenzied state as they go about a game of tag one day. With only less than an hour to go till the ship drops out of lightspeed, Ka'ra retreats to her room and reappears sometime later fully donned in her armor, helmet already on and her usual armament in place across her form.
The Adsern sector on the Out Rim is off the beaten track as it were. While you were able to use a hyperspace lane to get her, easing several hours off the journey the ship had to cut across wild space to ultimately arrive. The binary stars shine brightly as they fight over control of the eight planets with their multitude of moons. The sixth planet, Ka'ra points out, is your destination - Telia V. Taking an initial orbit with the planet's lone moon, Ka'ra gets to work at the sensors attempting to locate their final destination by hand. A temperate world, it’s continents are encompassed by a multitude of forests and dotted by tall mountains. One of such mountains Ka'ra indicates to be the destination.
"**The base is located here, built into the mountain,**" Ka'ra says by way of explanation.
(( IF there was anything specific you wanted to do during the travel down time, please PM me. ))

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-19 08:44:17)

Tanith sits in the pilot's chair, showing again that he knows true skill by making the flight in as effortless and gentle as possible. He's been quiet this morning, and while not anxious he does seem a touch more wired than usual. He reaches over and preps the comm station for Ka'ra, expecting her to do the talking again. She had yet to give him any info on dealing with the various spaceport controls, but he had been keeping track of what she had used so far.
*Wonder if Tendau is up yet?* he ponders as he brings the ship down towards the mountain base.
*Gah, rattlers. Rattlers in my guts even after all these years flying in combat. Makes even less sense for me to have em now, hell no one is shooting at me! I have a bad feeling about this job,* he thinks as he brings the ship in low and spins it on its axis smartly before setting it down facing the exit.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-08-19 08:58:01)

Instead of taking the comm like Tanith expects she sends a tight beamed transmission towards the base entering a code into the communication control panel to be transmitted. Seeing Tanith's questioning gaze she explains, "**Very few know about this base. Unless you send the proper signal, the bay doors set into the mountain won't even open. Likewise if you don't know what you're looking for its extremely hard to find.**"
True enough as Tanith pilots the Atin towards the indicated mountain an almost seamlessly hidden bay door begins to reveal itself as it opens for them. "**Don't be so nervous, Tanith. Everything is going to be fine,**" she says, reaching over to pat him reassuringly on the shoulder since she couldn't smile at him with the helmet on.

### **jwol** (2010-08-19 19:34:36)

After finishing his inventory of the medical facility and his check on the functionality of all the medical equipment contained within Tendau had headed off to his room for some much needed rest and relaxation before the mission. Upon learning of their imminent arrival the ithorian hustled around his quarters and located all of his supplies and placed them into his travel pack and his utility belt. Upon double checking he had everything he strode over to his cloak and slung it over his shoulders. Gazing about the room one last time the young jedi clips his saber to his belt and exits the room closing the door behind him.
Moving quickly through the corridors Tendau steps into the cockpit and quickly sits down behind Tanith and Ka'ra and says, **I'm sorry about my absences friends, some thoughts required me to meditate and resolve the inner conflicts they were causing.** Taking a deep breath he continues, **As for any issues with the mission my friend, I sense nothing more foreboding than the actual root of our mission, hopefully this one will go smoothly. As for any fighting well, I'll follow your lead Ka'ra, and I will put myself between either of you and any harm I can.** Upon completing saying this the ithorian nods with a resolute set to his mouths it is easy to tell that he is adamant about his position to prevent harm from occurring to his comrades.

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-20 03:10:06)

**"Na, not anything immediate you two. Just this insanity in general. Just a bad feeling, eh?"** he says as he begins the shutdown of the ships systems. *Damned rattlers,* he thinks as he runs through his checklists.
*Haven't even been shot at yet. Maybe that's what it is. This operation is too quiet. When the bottom does fall out, it's gonna be bad,* he reasons as he unstraps himself from the pilot's chair and stands, pulling out his helmet and putting it on.
**"Shall we?"** he asks, motioning towards the exit while checking to make sure all his gear is present.

</div>

Ka'ra lets out a small, lighthearted chuckle as she unbuckles the straps holding her to the copilot's chair. "**I've lived her for almost a year now. The worst you'll find is if you start wandering into the jungles.**" Standing and then passing Tanith and Tendau she heads toward the cargo bay and the ramp. She stops and turns around a thought apparently coming to her, something she had missed. **"It's important you don't speak about what I've told you to anyone but Lanius or myself. The people here… they are loyal to Jut-hakk as far as we can tell.**" Looking between Tendau and Tanith she adds, "**Our plans depend on it.**"
Not one to wait, she turns and hits the controls for the ramp. She climbs down it as it descends and is the first one off. The massive hanger bay greets you as you step out of the Atin Oya'ka. Built out of the very rock, massive pillars rise up at various intervals to secure the rock ceiling above. The bay itself seems capable of holding three freighters and many fighters, though the only contingent you see is a light freighter and about five snubfighters.
Ka'ra walks confidently keeping a steady pace as she passes the freighter and stops only when she sees a young man standing in the doorway she was heading for. Faltering only a moment she continues the pace, leading Tanith and Tendau toward him. The young man, his blonde hair a stark contrast to the dark robes he wears, turns to say something to someone in the hallway before he too starts walking toward Ka'ra; at his hip a lightsaber swings next to a pistol.
He smiles when he's within a few meters. "**Su cuy'gar, Ka'ra. bic jate bah ganar gar yaim,**" he says holding out his arm to her in greeting.
Reaching out she grasps his forearm, "**Su cuy'gar. Ni partaylir gar.**" As the man's attention turns to the Tanith and Tendau, she urges them forward. "**Lanius, this is Tanith Hogra and Tendau Mimwen.**"
He gives you both a nod of greeting. "**Yes, you're both quite welcome here. Welcome to Telia V. Please**" Extending his hand he motions for you to follow him. The corridor beyond, like the hanger was cut from the stone, though there's signs that it was once a naturally formed tunnel. Leading you from one tunnel to another, sometimes descending or ascending on a gently rising slope or a series of stairs. It's soon evident the mountain fortress is a maze on the inside. Finally he stops out side a door. "**You're free to use these quarters as you may, the mess is just down the hall there.**" With a glance and a nod at Ka'ra he says, "**We'll be back shortly and we can talk more.**"

### **jwol** (2010-08-23 12:08:39)

Upon meeting Lanius Tendau returns the nod of acknowledgement and follows quietly behind Ka'ra and the other Jedi. Keeping pace through the winding corridors so as not to get lost in the labrinth they were being led through.  *This place could be dangerous should one get lost here,*  the Jedi thinks to himself.
As the party approaches the quarters that have been set aside for them and they are dismissd by Lanius the ithorian asks quickly before the two figures can depart,  **Is there a map you could leave for Tanith and myself? It would be quite a shame to get lost and be unable to catch up with you soon brother. Also is there a training remote you could loan to me in the meantime? I was hoping to get a little practice in before i meditate.**

*What the hell's Hut Hack? Some kind of cold?* Tanith wonders as he follows her down the ramp. *Doesn't matter. Not hear to make conversation anyway.*
He eyes the snubfighters greedily as they pass them, trying to gauge their abilities. He also looks over the freighter in passing, looking to see how modified it was. As they approach the young blond man with the lightsaber he notices the faltering of Ka'ra's stride and the tone as they speak to each other, *No wonder a Mando would have a kind outlook on damned Jedi. Forgot she's still a young girl. Just how many Jedi are we dealing with hear?* he wonders, glad his helmet hides the look on his face as he eyes the younger man. *I'm learning that damnable language as soon as possible though,* he thinks.
He ignores the quarters, determined to check the mess's stock of liquors. **"Take your time. Where can a being buy supplies here, eh? And how well stocked is the mess?"** he says, making sure to keep his voice even, knowing his thoughts are biased. *Wonder how many of these damned Jedi are mind readers. I'm liking this less and less.*

---

### **Alicia** (2010-08-24 11:10:35)

Lanius nods in understanding to Tendau, "**You can find a map on the console within. Practice of any sort is restricted to the training area. The mess is stocked well enough, and supplies are requisitioned through the quartermaster.**"
"**Kaysh copaani gal**," Ka'ra says beside him with amusement, knowing what Tanith was really after.
"**Ah**," Lanius says, turning his head to look at her as she spoke and then looks back to Tanith. "**I'm afraid you won't find any alcohol. It's a strict policy here.**" With of a clap of his hands together, he dismisses the business at hand. "**We will be back in a few hours, and then we can further discuss our business.**" Unless stopped again, he turns with Ka'ra to head down the hall.
The quarters assigned to you are sparse to say the least. A bunk is nestled into opposing stone walls, with a chest of drawers underneath it. Beside each bunk is a desk with a chair. Set into the wall between the desks is the only sign of technology aside from the lights in the room, the console.
The map to the facility is easily accessible and surprisingly, unlike most maps this one is set three dimensionally. The reason is quickly apparent as you find that there are no true levels, making a two dimensional map essentially worthless. The facility was built around a series of naturally formed tunnels and caverns. Since not all the caverns are on the same level, sloping tunnels and stairs were excavated to connect them. Looking over the map, its not hard to picture the layout of the base as long as one keeps in mind how it was developed.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-24 11:33:58)

Grumbling under his breath Tanith roams into the quarters to consult the map on the terminal. *No frakking alcohol. Strict policy. Lightsaber training in its own facility. Just where in the hell are we?* he rants internally while memorizing directions to the quartermaster and armory.
**"Need anything from the quartermaster Tendau? If not I'll be back shortly, or I may join you in the 'training facility,'"** he asks the Ithorian while pulling up the directions to the facility for him.
While he waits for Tendau's response he keys Ka'ra up on his armor's internal comm, which automatically mutes his external speaker: **"Lass, what kind of installation has strict policies against alcohol? And lightsaber training facilities? Mind giving me a hint as to the whereabouts of the bottle on board the Atin?"** he asks sweetly.

**I could use to see if they have a training remote I may be able to take with me on our errand, but it never hurts to see if they have anything else that could be useful.** The ithorian says as he places his pack down in the corner and removes his outer cloak, draping it over his pack after folding it a few times.
Taking a look around the room real quick he tries to take in the surroundings as best as he can, taking a look at the map while the human studies it.
Stretching his arms wide and double checking his weapon is clipped securely to his belt the young jedi continues, **As for training, I would love some company, only so much one can accomplish against remotes.** With a nod to Tanith, Tendau starts to head down the corridors towards the quartermaster. Looking over his shoulder he states, **Might as well head to the quartermaster first, we never know what we might find.** With that the Ithorian waits for the human to catch up so they can travel together to their destination.

*Of all the bloody…* Tanith's thoughts along that line die off as quickly as they start. *Easy goes it. Not a teenager anymore, not by far. Just do your job and be done. If some Jedi doesn't decide to skewer me on a fluke,* he thinks as Tendau responds, *Wha' the hell? 'Only so much one can accomplish against remotes'?! Does he expect me to shoot at him?!?! Insanity. Surrounded by religious fanatics. Gah! The job, focus on the job. Fly the damned ship, keep your head down. Avoid lightsabers at all costs,* his inner monologue rages on the entire trip to the armory.
On the trip there he eyes all the residents and defenses they come across, gathering all the details he can since they're in enemy territory. *They probably won't have a damned thing of use. Bleh, lets see,* he thinks as they approach the place, having followed the directions he had memorized from the map.

You find the quartermaster in one of the storage bays, going over a datapad list with an assistant in what seems to be an ever occurring task in his attempt in keeping perfect inventory records. The assistant looks bored as he checks label after label on the crates, reciting their contents to the quartermaster. The quartermaster doesn't look up as the two of you enter instead mearly bellows, "**Yes? What do you want?**"

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-27 00:41:40)

**"Greetings, quartermaster. I'd like to see about getting some gear, or upgrading what I've got. I like the look of this armory, sir, I haven't seen one this well organized in years, eh?"** Tanith begins after taking off his helmet, giving the man his best knowledgeable soldier look.
**"And my friend here is looking for a remote to train with, one he can take with him when we leave out again,"** he adds, remembering Tendau with him.

Striking his best "apprentice" posturing and tone, Tendau follows Tanith's lead and replys, **Yes sir, I haven't seen anything this well organized since the jedi archives on Coruscant.**  Hoping his compliment wasn't too much the young jedi continues, **If you have any sir I have been looking for a remote to practice with while I have been traveling, as well as any lightsaber parts or crystals you may have available in your vast inventories sir.** Bowing his head slightly after asking the ithorian hopes his performance went as well as the humans obvious knack for smooth talking.

### **Alicia** (2010-08-27 13:47:25)

The quartermaster gives a grunted hmph at your attempt to sway him with honeyed words. "**You'll find the remotes in the training area.**" he barks to Tendau. "**To take one out you'll need permission from Lanius. As for parts and crystals, you'll have to go through him too.**" As he speaks the man turns around to face the pair fully, the gruff man is in his late thirties, a large scar brandishing the left part of his face running from the edge of his eyebrow to his jaw below his ear. Clipped to his belt is a lightsaber.
His attention then turns to Tanith before glancing over his datapad, tapping it as he goes through a list. "**Name and mission?**"

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-27 14:33:55)

**Well sir, Master Lanius actually told us to speak to you about receiving any supplies we thought we may need, as for the mission, he has not specifically told us what it entails, so I believe my friend here is looking for general supplies, or anything that may be a bit better than he already carries on his person.** Bowing again hoping to show his respect for the quartermaster, the young ithorian continues, **As for our names sir, I am Tendau Mimwen and this is Tanith Hoagra and we're at your service.** Bowing again the jedi hopes his bit of smooth talking gets them a look at the supplies the quartermaster was stalwartly defending.

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-27 16:09:30)

**"My Ithorian friend is right, he did send us, but it's no matter,"** Tanith struggles not to flinch and barely succeeds at hearing his own name come out. *More Jedi. Even the **bleedin'** quartermaster is a Jedi?*
**"If you all are strapped for supplies I can find mine elsewhere. Guess that's why they put their best to the job, eh? Keep track of it all. I remember back in the Mandalorian War, my section's quartermaster was something else. That man could find anything within reason, and generally kept an amazing stock too. He procured so much gear he *made* money for the Republic, but I guess he was one of a kind,"** Tanith's voice takes on a wistful, reminiscing quality as he tries to play the man's pride.
*All right, time to toss the dice,* he thinks. **"Well, Tendau, guess we should away to the training area to get your gear,"** he says with a slight hint of disappointment as he half turns to walk away...

The quartermaster turns back to his work overseeing the younger man comb through the crate. "**Come back when you have requisition orders,**" he barks and then with a huff mutters about newcomers who think they're all important to not have orders before wasting his time.
Turning away disappointed, you find your way to the training room. A massive room which has been divided into quarters by a series of mats and reinforce boundaries depending on the activity the area was designated for. The reason becomes clear as a pair of Force users go at it with their weapons of choice, one a lightsaber, the other a large vibrobladed polearm in one of the rooms. The cavern from the looks of it has been reinforced to prevent the room from collapsing on those within from the stresses of the inhabitants sharpening their skills.
One mat, designated as a workout area has a series of men milling about in various stages of undress as they change out of a silver armor. Other than the two duelling Force users and the three soldiers going about their workout, the massive room is clear of occupants.

### **jwol** (2010-08-29 10:39:28)

As Tendau walks into the training facility he takes a moment to study the room and get a better feel for the room. The ithorian after gazing about the area strides over to the three training men and asks,  **Greetings sentients, may I ask who is in charge of this training facility?**  pointing at Tanith the Jedi continues,  **Because my friend over there and I were hoping to get a bit of a workout in while we wait for our meeting with Master Lanius.** 
(UtF +14 to see if Tendau notices any thing strange about the troopers training and their armor while he looks around the facility)

*My old quartermaster may have made the Republic money, but he was a prick too. Wouldn't let a damned thing loose without his precious paperwork, in triplicate no less. All quartermasters must take a course in obstinate assery. Heh!* Tanith thinks a he enters the training room. The snap hiss of a lightsaber almost makes him jump and draw, but he stifles the urge. To keep just anyone from seeing his reactions to this facility he replaces his helmet.
*Oh, this is just bleeding beautiful it is. What the hell have I gotten myself into?* he wonders for the fourth or fifth time, watching the two face off. Tendau's questions bring him out of his memories and paranoia a bit just to throw him back into them. *Is that… can't be. Most of the stores where destroyed at Lehon. At least… we were told they were. Damnable Jedi,* Tanith thinks, following Tendau, his attention cemented on the silver armor, trying to find out if it's the cursed armor he learned to hate and fear even more than Mandalorian armor.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-08-30 17:08:52)

The armor itself, while reminiscent of the set used by the Sith troops during the war is of a different, better quality and the helmet is shaped differently. The troopers, apparently finding it odd that they're being addressed by a Jedi, glance at each other before one speaks up. "**Jedi manage their own training, taking charge of their student's and balancing each others'."** Shifting slightly onto his heels he continues, "**Ka'ra Bralor manages the training of everyone else.**"
"There's no set usage for the gym as long as you follow the rules... Basic curtousy stuff," another pipes up. The others go back to gathering their gear, apparently finished with their workout.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-31 04:26:53)

*Rattlers. Just rattlers. Not in a Sith base. Think I'm going back to the quarters before I shoot something on accident,* Tanith thinks as he watches the troopers gear up and leave. Now that he sees them in the armor he can see less similarities and more differences in the armor itself. *Something isn't right, Sith base or not. Why won't these damned rattlers go away?*
**"We can't accomplish a damned thing without the lass or this Lanius barv Tendau, why don't we just head on back to the quarters, eh?"** he asks, leaning in close to Tendau to whisper, **"Besides, this place sits as easily as Wookie liquor on my stomach eh? Tell you what, first chance we get I'll either buy or build you a remote, what d'ya say?"**

---

### **jwol** (2010-08-31 09:13:25)

Tendau looks over to Tanith and notes his unease. *Something definately doesn't feel right here.* Glancing around the room again the jedi nods to the pilot and says, **I'm beginning to feel leaving our quarters was a mistake as well.** Again looking around him the young ithorian just can't seem to shake the uneasy feeling tickling at the back of his mind.
As the human and ithorian head down the corridor and arrive at their quarters, Tendau waits until they are inside and says softly, **Was it just me, or did that armor look way too similar to the sith suits from the war?**

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-31 10:26:57)

**"Yes it did. At least in some ways. I'd have to lay hands on a suit to see just how similar. It's definitely better made, and the design is slightly different,"** Tanith replies, thinking back to all the troops he'd seen in Sith armor during the war. He moves to the cot and sits down, preparing to ask a question who's answer he doesn't want to think about, **"Question, friend Tendau: when was the last time you saw this many Jedi in one spot, eh?"**
He sits back and leans against the wall, wondering, *Will they pitch a fit if I decide to sleep on the ship? Can keep Tentia company, and tear the damned thing apart looking for that bottle. Hmmmm…*

### **jwol** (2010-09-01 17:21:35)

Pausing to think on his companion's question, the ithorian attempts to remember when the last time he was surrounded by so many trained in the force. **I do not know, back during the civil war definately, most of my order has been in hiding or have left on peacekeeping and healing missions, with out a real formal council structure, much of the order has fragmented.** Thinking back to his encounters with those carrying lightsabers and trained in the force in the installation they were currently in he can't seem to place the unbriddled emotions flowing from the individuals here. **To be honest Tanith, I don't know if those individuals trained in the force were jedi, or something else….** drifting on in midsentence he brings himself back to their conversation, **… the way they held themselves was not quite like most of the jedi I have encountered in my time with the order, I think we may want to avoid spending too much time here… meaning the quicker we are on our way with our mission the better off we may be.** Finishing his thoughts out loud the jedi sits down on the cot across from the human and takes a deep calming breath.

### **Alicia** (2010-09-11 18:10:51)

Managing to find your way back to your quarters, you don't have to wait long till both Lanius and Ka'ra arrive, knocking on the door to gain entrance.
Ka'ra takes a position by the door, leaning against the wall taking her helmet off to hold under her arm. She wears a frown as Lanius remains standing his hands calmly held behind his back.
"Ka'ra has given me an idea of what she has told you, which I realize is not a lot. I apologize for this as the lack of information she was able to give you was limited due to her sense of honor in keeping her word." He looks back at Ka'ra with a small smile who just rolls her eyes at him.
"I know you have many questions, but please bear with me as I try to explain what is going on." He brings his hands out in front of him to clasp as he takes a deep breath. "Near two years ago, toward the end of the Civil War, Jut-hake revealed himself to me, presenting his work and order as an alternate to the war torn and disjointed sect the Jedi Order had become. I joined him, accepting his offer to learn under him in the hopes of getting the many questions I had answered that the Jedi could not or would not provide."
He pauses again and then continues slowly. "I quickly rose in the ranks to become one of his trusted lieutenants, earning this base to run as part of my reward for his trust as well as being let into his confidence. It was then that I discovered the first part to what Jut-hake truly seeks. He wishes to resurrect the Dark Reaper, a weapon created by Sith Alchemy and used during the Great Sith War near a hundred years ago. It was powered by a unique power core called the Force Harvester, which was capable of literally sucking the life Force out of anything it came into contact with. The more power which was used from it the more life it would extinguish. Combined with the turbo lasers built into the Reaper it could distinguish life on a planet within hours."
"While I don't know the specifics of his plans, I know he intends to unleash it on the galaxy as a whole." He let's out a long sigh, letting the words he had just uttered to be absorbed by the two men. "Part of my duties over the last year has been to research and attempt to locate the fragments of the Dark Reaper, scattered through out the galaxy by Ulic Qel-Droma. I've managed to find some of the less important pieces, but I fear that I will be forced to reveal the suspected location of the most dangerous component, the Force Harvester."
Looking back at Ka'ra again, she gives him a slight nod. "Ka'ra and I have been preparing to form a team of individuals we can use to make sure he doesn't have the opportunity to use it and to protect the Harvester. You two are the start of that team and in the coming weeks your expertise and knowledge may become invaluable to our mission." He looks between the two of you, gauging your reactions to the truth behind the missions. "Now... what questions do you have to ask?"

### **jwol** (2010-09-13 16:29:03)

Sitting silently the ithorian takes in all that Lanius has to tell them. **I have seen what ashes remain after two great wars have scoured this galaxy, to let a weapon such as that be unleashed on the unsuspecting masses just putting them selves back together after these last conflicts have finally been extinguished, I cannot, and will not let that happen.** Taking a deep breath and readying himself mentally for the upcoming trials Tendau takes a moment to center himself, **What would you have me do?** the young jedi asks.

---

### **Magical2099** (2010-09-14 07:22:14)

Tanith sits with his arms and ankles crossed, giving the appearance of not caring or at least not respecting the man speaking. At his remark about Ka'ra's lack of information a rueful grin streaks across his pained face beneath the helmet. *I think it has less to do with honor and more to do with 'how in the bloody hells am I supposed to convince anyone to help considering the risks? Considering the opposition? Considering the fact that we're asking for frakking charity?'* he thinks as the pompous little blond tells his tale of woe.
*"…His work and order as an alternate to the war torn and disjointed sect the Jedi Order had become…"? Wait, you meant 'has been for years' right? They didn't want to answer your questions, eh? Were they any kin to the questions Revan's black soul wanted answered? Or were they like most Jedi queries, simply steps in that direction?* he thinks as he listens, his mind chewing over memories he wishes he could never recall.
*'Dark Reaper'? So this Jut-Hakk isn't capable of destroying the galaxy on his own like Revan or Malak, he wants to dig up other abomination's toys to do it with. What have I gotten myself into? No, no, wait just a damned minute, what has Niandra gotten me into?!* he thinks, his attitude shifting to anger and annoyance.
As the man finishes his plea, Tanith finds his mind a turmoil of conflicting emotions. *This bastard at least wants to stop him, but how long afterwards, should he succeed, before he decides to burn the galaxy himself?* he thinks before Tendau offers his services. *Gah, and Tendau. Poor barv. Naive and pure. Downright likable if he weren't a Jedi. How long before he falls and tries to take the galaxy with him?* he thinks, wanting to rub his face and forehead but stopping himself, remembering the helmet.
*Niandra gave them my name, either because she doesn't see my loss as a great one or because she thinks I'm that good a pilot. Better not think to deeply on that one, not yet anyway. Either way, she knows my feelings about Jedi. She was there when I left the Navy. She must believe in this Lanius frakk. Just like the Republic believed in Revan, both times. Why? Why drag me into this? Why trust any of them? Ka'ra is firmly in Lanius's pocket, that's obvious enough. Have to watch that girl in the future. What the hell am I talking about? Am I staying for this series of suicide runs culminating in betrayal?* his thoughts ramble, bewildered.
*Damn and double damn. I guess I am. Not for the Republic though. I'm done putting my life on the line for people too ignorant to know that Jedi aren't worth the risk they pose to the galaxy. No, this is for my dead brothers and sisters, for me. Every damned Jedi I can kill will be a thousand less innocents dead in the future. A thousand less wasted lives. And maybe, just maybe, some will learn something along the way. Learn that no being should be trusted with the kind of power these Jedi throw around so causally,* his decision made he stands, and levels his gaze on Lanius.
His mind no longer in turmoil, he delivers his commitment, **"Sure. Where do we start?"** His voice is calm and professional, conveying his newfound purpose and determination.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-09-14 12:48:42)

Lanius exchanges a glance with Ka'ra some unspoken communication passing between them before he turns back to his new Ithorian and Human recruits. "**For now, there's nothing to be done but to ready yourself and keep quiet. There are some loyal to me here but most are undyingly loyal to the image Jut-hakk has put forward. Why they can be turned around in time, we're running out of it.**"
He looks directly at Tendau, "**We have collected a vast library here, perhaps there is something there which you would find interesting and useful. With the disbandment of the Jedi Order, many of us have gone in search of retrieving what we can to preserve their libraries.**"
Next he looks at Tanith, "**Ka'ra was quite adamant in finding away to fulfill her agrreement with you, Mr. Hogra.**" He starts, his gaze going to Ka'ra for a moment who has a small smug smile. "**While we don't have much in the way of monetary wealth, there might be something in the way of trade. This planet is rich in various unexplored resources if you have the wherewithal to seek it out.**"

The jedi bows his head in thanks to Lanius.**My thanks Lanius, I will use every available moment to continuing pouring over the holocrons and other artifacts that you have gathered.** With that Tendau grabs his travel pack and heads to the library, intent on pouring over as much information and practicing the steps brought to him by the contained records, that is until he is required to board the *Titan's Valiant*.
