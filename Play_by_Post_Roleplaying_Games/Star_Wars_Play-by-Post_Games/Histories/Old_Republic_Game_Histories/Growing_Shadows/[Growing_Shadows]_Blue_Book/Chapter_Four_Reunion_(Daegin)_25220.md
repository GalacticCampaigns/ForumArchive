# Chapter Four: Reunion (Daegin)

### **Alicia** (2012-04-26 16:36:13)

It's been several months since Daegin has arrived on Telia V brought there by Ka'ra herself, and the Jawa may still find the mountain encompassed bunker an imposing place to reside. Telia V itself is a temperate world and the mountain the facility resides in is surrounded by a lush jungle. Hidden from sensors by the dense rock, only those who know where to find it come here and Daegin finds very few do.
Finding work in the massive hanger bay, the Jawa mechanic is left to his own devices with the only expectation to maintain the ships who pass through. The hanger bay in and of itself is an impressive affair. Built out of the very rock, massive pillars rise up at various intervals to secure the rock ceiling above. The bay itself seems capable of holding three freighters and many fighters, though the only contingent about now is five snubfighters and a Dynamic-class freighter dubbed *Star's End* which Daegin would have noted is piloted by a FA-4 Pilot droid.<div style="text-align: right;">

With his day of regular maintenance completed, Daegin would be getting ready to go about his own personal projects when a chime goes off in the hanger bay indicating an arrival. Recognizing the ship as soon as it enters the bay, the Jawa realizes that Ka'ra has come to visit after being absent for the past few months.

Daegin pulls a rag out of his back pocket and does a quick wipe over his hands to make sure they are clean, or at least mostly clean. As soon as he is satisfied that most of the grease and grime is off of his hands he places the rag back in his pocket and the adjusts his personal translator, that he wear almost as though it were a throat mic, and then he switches it on.
As he nears Ka'ra's ship the usual questions start to run through his mind. *I wonder how the ship was handling during this flight… Maybe they found some new tech I can examine… Hopefully they had a safe trip and there aren't any blaster holes for me to fix in her engines… I wonder what they were up to for these last few months…*
Once he feels that he is close enough to where the ship is settling down he waits patiently for Ka'ra to step off of the ship. While he waits he pulls out his datapad and looks over the maintenance that might be coming up in the coming days. As much as he likes how much free time he now has to do his own things, he does miss the hustle and bustle of the big spaceports.

The canopy of the two-seater opens revealing Ka'ra in the full glory of her familiar armor. Her armor is of an unusual design, made of a strong metal which could theoretically stop a lightsaber. It's only distinguishable feature is the T shaped visor on the helmet, otherwise it could pass as a form of regular light armor. It was obviously made custom for her by the close fit to her form. Dropping to the ground it's obvious by her demeanor she is tired and apparently alone as the second seat is empty. This fact is unusual as Daegin has never seen her without her Strill companion, the musk of the creature a hard thing to forget, but something which may not necessarily have bothered the Jawa.
Spotting the Jawa she heads in his direction, "**Su'cuy, Daegin,**" she says tiredly, speakers relaying her voice from the helmet. His translator would relay the first bit as a greeting. "**It's been awhile. You're looking… well.**"

He looks up at Ka'ra and gives her a small smile as she walks up. He speaks in his native tongue and his words come out rather fast, like most Jawas, but they would easily be translated to "**Hello Ka'ra. I am doing well, though I sometimes miss the hustle of the spaceport. How did your ship handle? Is there anything that you would like me to look at for you? Did you travel alone this time?** He pauses for a bit to let her hear what he says so that she can reply.
He does look around, and at her for the second to see if there is anything amiss that would need his attention.

Should I play it as though my personal translator translates my words, or just translates others words for me?

It takes only a moment for Duggs personal translator to relay the words into basic and as she responds there's a hint of amusement in her accented words. "**The Ka'raverd is running well. Just the usual maintenance and refueling will be necessary I think, though I'd appreciate it if it was done in a timely manner.**" She pauses as she too looks around taking in the hanger bay. "**Yes, I'm quite alone this time. Tentia is visiting with my family and is keeping an eye on Emily.**" She says answering the Jawa's unspoken question. Emily, Daegin would remember, is Ka'ra's young ward though he's never met her.

After Ka'ra finishes speaking he gives her a slight nod. "**I will get her maintenance taken care of with haste. I will probably start as soon as you take your leave from here. I am glad to hear that all is going well so far. How is Emily, and your family, doing? How long are you planning on being here?**"
He looks down at his datapad for a second and makes a few notes about the Ka'raverd before he looks back up at Ka'ra.

"**Long enough,** Ka'ra obliquely responds, glancing around again. "**There's something I wish to speak with you about if you wouldn't mind meeting me in the library in a few hours.**" She looks down at the Jawa, making sure he'll agree to the meeting. "**Don't forget, three hours,**" she says before she heads out of the bay, leaving Daegin to his work.

He gives Ka'ra a nod before she heads off so she knows that he heard her and will be there. He brings up an alarm and sets it for two hours, so he will have some time to clean up before he heads to the library, and then he gets to work on the Ka'raverd making sure that it is still ready for flight, and gets topped off with fuel. He takes his time and makes sure that it is all done properly.
When his alarm goes off he picks up all of his tools and cleans up the area. One he is happy that it is all put away he heads to his room and takes a quick shower and then puts on a clean pair of coveralls. He wanders to the Library and finds somewhere to sit while he waits for Ka'ra.
