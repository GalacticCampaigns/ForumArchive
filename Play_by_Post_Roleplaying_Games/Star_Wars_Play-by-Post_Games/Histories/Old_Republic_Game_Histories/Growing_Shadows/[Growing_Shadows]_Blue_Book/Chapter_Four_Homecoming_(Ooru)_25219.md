# Chapter Four: Homecoming (Ooru)

### **Alicia** (2012-04-26 16:11:37)

Time passes slowly on Telia, even as the inhabitants fill it with their own pursuits. Ooru has recently returned and has been back long enough to realize nothing has really changed aside from the fact he's never seen so many people in the facility at one time. It seems over the last couple months Lanius has been busy recruiting others from the Brotherhood's midst to his cause. The inhabitants still seem to come and go, working through their own pursuits or running some sort of errand for Lanius they aren't discussing.
While Lanius seems to have resumed his administrative duties of the facility he remains distracted and reclusive often disappearing for long periods of time. It’s during one of these absences Ka’ra returns, much to what seems to be to the chagrin of some of the residence of the facility. At least, the good news seems she hasn't brought that Strill of her's along. Taking up residence in her shared quarters with Lanius it's not long before she seeks out the Miraluka.

A gentle tone pulls Ooru from his morning meditations. The last couple days since his return to Telia V have been relatively uneventful - for him anyway. Obviously Lanius, and most of the others at the base, were up to something but it was beyond guessing. Probably something to do with Jut-Haak and the Force Harvester. Ooru was learning to keep his goals clear though: First was to reconcile for past deeds on Alpheridies, second was to wait and see what the Force would bring his way. Whether it involved Lanius or Jut-Haak wasn't going to be up to him.
Rising slowly, Ooru grabs his folded shirt heads for his quarters a short distance away. The passageways are indeed bustling with morning traffic but the Miraluka deftly makes his way through the crowded sections and finally reaches his destination. Notably absent so far is Odan-Ur, the Draethos that first helped Ooru on his arrival at Telia V, but perhaps he's just busy elsewhere. Ooru passes through the main room where the stock furniture somehow still lends a warm feel to the otherwise spartan quarters. After a quick shower and fresh change of clothes, he prepares to meet the day.

That's a pretty decent generic start I think. Very apt to be interrupted methinks. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

There's a chime at the door as Ooru begins to dress, the timing being a bit unfortunate.
Choosing to open the door, the Miraluka may be perhaps a bit surprised to find who stands out in the hallway. Glancing down past the way she had come is a young woman of average height, and short fiery red hair. Ooru would recognize her easily enough from the photographs he spotted in Lanius's quarters though obviously older placing her at about 17 years of age. Ka'ra's blue gaze immediately turns to the open door and meets Ooru's own. "**I'm sorry to bother you, are you Ooru?**" she asks in a low tone, her words coming out with something of a musical quality and accented by her native tongue.

"**Yes,**" replies Ooru, trying to recall the girl's name from Lanius' quarters. He'd seen a picture of a group of people, some sort of family despite the obvious lack of resemblance between some of them, and one of the young ladies was holding a pet... "**You must be Ka'ra? Please come in…**" he motions for her to enter.
A low table and some cushions off to one side of the main room offer the best chance at small talk, but somehow Ooru suspects Ka'ra isn't here for that.

The young woman seems relieved as she enters the quarters. "**I am indeed. Ka'ra Bralor," she says with a smile, pausing just beyond the doorway taking in the quarters before making her way over to the table. Stopping short of sitting down, Ka'ra turns and waits for Ooru to close the door. "**Lanius hoped you would be here. We have a mission we'd like you to go on, if you're interested. He understands you've been wanting to do some.. soul searching,**" she pauses on the last words as if trying to decide how best to put it.**

Ooru depresses the doorpad and it shuts silently behind Ka'ra. The computer increases the ambient light level as well, sensing more than just the Miraluka's presence. Not that he prefers total darkness but bright lights first thing in the morning are one of the few universal dislikes of most species it seems.
"**I wouldn't say I've been soul *searching*, more like soul *cleansing* I think. Righting past wrongs and all that.**" Ooru sits comfortably on one of the lush cushions and invites his guest to do the same. "**I wasn't certain Lanius cared whether I was here or not, to be honest. What did you have in mind?**"

---

Ka'ra doesn't move at first to take a seat in one of the offered cushions, but finally out of an attempt to be polite she does. Apparently she isn't intending to stay long. "**You've made an impression on him. As such, he's taken an interest in you, and because of that so have I especially since… well… you're a friend of Tonin and Davian,** she says the last bluntly. Cocking her head she watches him as she goes on, "**We've received word Tonin was able to recover the research data from Acheron, and is now attempting to create his own Harvester.**"

Ooru lets out a deep sigh. His eyes close as he recalls the battle to recover Davian from Jut-Haak - and what it almost cost them all. Even after so much time it feels odd to be talking about what happened so casually, as if anyone not present in that ship could understand what things were really like.
"**Well Jut-Haak didn't stop even when he was dead - I'm sure as soon as he catches wind…**"
The sentence trails off as Ooru remembers Jut-Haak's power over Davian's body. His next words are chosen carefully:
"**Ka'ra, how certain are you that it's really Tonin?**"

With a shake of her head the young woman indicates her uncertainty. "**Something is driving Tonin, but without going to meet with him ourselves it's hard to say for sure. Right now…**" she pauses, debating her words and then continues frankly. "**Lanius believes he's found a way to take the Harvester out of the picture.**" She let's out a brief sigh. "**I'm about to meet others I'm to recruit for this and I really hate repeating myself. So if you're interested in helping…**" she lets the words trail off the meaning clear: he would either come with her to meet the others, or he would stay and take no part.

He mulls her words over carefully before giving an answer. Destroying a Force Harvester, or maybe a couple, is one thing. Putting a friend in a coma and taking another "out of the picture" is a dark path indeed. Ooru hopes this isn't what Lanius is suggesting. His eyes narrow as he replies:
"**Lanius' memory of our encounter with the Jut-Haak phantom may be understandably hazy, mine is not. I was offered a position by Jut-Haak himself and refused - I'm not interested in that kind of power. I care about my *friends*. As long as there are relics like the Force Harvester there will be people trying to find them and others trying to stop that from happening. I am neither. My first attempt at saving a friend turned out only marginally successful and earned me the ire of Jut-Haak. I will help you but only to make sure Tonin survives this - preferably in better condition than his brother - and to see if Jut-Haak may yet be saved as well.**"
Ooru rises from his pillow and grabs his pack near the entrance. As he looks back at Ka'ra his gaze drifts beyond her to his robe and pikestaff mounted in a small niche in the wall. Someday, perhaps, he will pick them up and join the Brotherhood proper but it may well be that the Force has different plans for him.
"**After you?**"
