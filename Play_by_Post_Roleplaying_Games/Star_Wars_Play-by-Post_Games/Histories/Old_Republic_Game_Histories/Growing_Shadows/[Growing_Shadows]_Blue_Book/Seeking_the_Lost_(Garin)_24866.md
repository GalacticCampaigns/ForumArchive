# Seeking the Lost (Garin)

### **Alicia** (2010-11-03 15:36:21)

**Garin** Chapter Two prelude
For the last few weeks since recording the message for Malena expressing her concerns over what's been happening with the Bralor family and the subsequent visit to the family's yaim, Garin has been tracking the citadel-class cruiser and the daughter who "borrowed" it owned by Jiles Bralor on his behalf.
The tracking device planted on the ship seemed to have been working sporadically as if being blocked by some sort of distortion, but over the last few days Garin has been recieving a clear signal.
It directs him to a region in the outer rim where dropping out of hyperspace he's confronted with a Republic Hammerhead-class cruiser, the transponder beacon proclaiming it the Titan's Valiant.

Three weeks he had been tracking Ka'ra. He should have found her in a third of that time but something was scrambling the tracking device that had been placed in the the ship she stole. Stole was really too strong of a work considering it belonged to Ka'ra's father Jiles. Perhaps borrowed for an indefinite time was a better way to describe it.
The hyperspace proximity alarm woke him from his slumber as the fighter was close to dropping out of hyperspace. blinking his eyes to focus on the controls Garin watched as the ship reverted to real space. Looking out the canopy to the area in front of him was a Republic Hammerhead-class cruiser. Looking at the comm. array the cruisers transponder beacon identified the vessel as the Titan's Valiant. **"Interesting. I haven't seen one of those in a few years."** He said out loud to no one in particular. the last time he saw a Hammerhead-class cruiser he was on the opposing side. Memories from 5 years past resurfaced for a few seconds before he pushed them back down.
Checking the ships computer the program that was picking up the tracking signal was coming through crystal clear emanating from the capital ship before him. **"Finally."**
Bringing up the ships engines he left them at one quarter power as he slowly angled towards the cruiser as his own transponder sent out who he was. With a touch of a button he opened his comms. and hailed the Republic ship that was slowly growing larger.
**"Republic cruiser Titan's Valiant, This is Garin Del-Fin out of Concord Dawn requesting clearance to land. I have business with the owner of a citadel-class cruiser that is aboard your ship. A Ka'ra Bralor."** While waiting for a response from the communications officer he began running calculations for a quick jump out if things turned bad.

There's a long pause over the communications relay as the Titan's communication offer gets to responding to Garin. As Garin draws closer, he can see the Republic vessel moves itself between the lone fighter and a small damage freighter. By the looks of it, the cruiser was in the process of providing humanitarian aid to the stranded vessel.
"***Titan's Valiant* to starfighter. Please standby,**" a female voice rings out over the fighter's comm speakers after a long moment. There's an even longer silence, allowing Garin to get even closer before there's finally another reply. "**Starfighter, please proceed to landing in hanger bay via incoming approach vector. Please turn over navigational control at the indicated range.**"Over a tight beam data burst, Garin sees a specific trajectory set by the Republic ship.

As the seconds stretched out longer Garin notices that the Cruiser moves into a position to place itself between his fighter and a freighter it seemed to be providing aid to. Glancing at the chrono 15 seconds had passed. Taking a deep breath he relaxed either they would let him land or turn him away and that might involve taking a few shots at him to emphasize their point.
"Titan's Valiant to starfighter. Please standby," This time the silence was longer as the cruiser was beginning to loom even larger as the fighter slowly crept towards the larger vessel. Looking at the navcomputer he was happy to see that a new course had been computed and was ready to go. But it wasn't needed as the female voice sounded out again.
"Starfighter, please proceed to landing in hanger bay via incoming approach vector. Please turn over navigational control at the indicated range."
With clearance he pushed the throttle forward and edges the craft to the indicated heading. **"Roger Titan's Valiant proceeding to course indicated."** He cut the comms. **"Thanks for the warm welcome. I wonder just how many they will have waiting for me when I arrive?"**
When the indicator on his screen flashed green he turned over navigational control and relaxed as he rode the rest of the way in. ***This should be interesting.***

The cruisers tractor beams easily take control of the small craft, directing it within its embrace in a smooth ride. At close proximity the sight of readying cannons reveals that the crew seems to be anxious, but as they aren't targeting you specifically, you can only assume they are just preparing for trouble. Brought into the hanger bay, the fighter is set down on a pad normally reserved for incoming shuttles of which there are only a few. Prominent in the bay is a Dynamic-class frieghter and the welcome sight of your target. The *Atin Oya'ka* rests parked some distance away and attached to its docking clamps is the Kar'averd.<div style="text-align: right;">

</div>

Deck hands move to avoid your ship, moving out of the way of the security detail meant to make sure you don't cause any trouble. Their weapons are aimed at the deck, but there's no question that there would be three rifles firing at Garin's head should he make the wrong move. Moving behind them though is another welcome sight. Donned in her black-purple armor, her helmet covering her features, it is unclear whether she was pleased or anxious about the meeting. Ever a constant companion, Tentia follows behind, its tail flicking eagerly as it recognizes Garin and a small bounce of inbounding joy at the reunion is evident.
Stepping past the small circle of security personnel, the daughter of the once great Jiles Bralor now stands between the two forces. She looks over Garin's craft for a moment before her attention comes to full attention on her brother's old friend. "**Garin**," Ka'ra says, her voice carefully neutral. "**What are you doing here?**"

Garin felt the tractor beam take hold of his fighter as it began to smoothly guide him into the shuttle bay. Where, not surprisingly, he was set down in a rather open area. ***At least they're being cautious.***
Tucked out of the way was his target. The *Atin Oya'ka* It looked to be in good shape. That told him that Ka'ra wasn't stranded here and that she was probably alright and still here by her own will.
Looking around he saw the deck hands moving quickly out of the way. Not only from his fighter but the approaching security detail that was on hand for his arrival. In addition to the detail he saw the familiar black-purple armor of Ka'ra. If it weren't for his helmet a those that could see him would have seen the smile that appeared on his face. It had been a couple of years since he had last seen her.
As soon as the fighter touched down he opened the canopy of the fighter and removed himself from the cockpit. Taking notice of the security and their lowered weapons he walked forward a few paces. Where he stood in front of Ka'ra who stood between him and the security detail. "Garin," She said, her voice carefully neutral and even. "What are you doing here?"
Standing there in his black, red and gray armor, the colors of the Del-Fin clan, he looked to Ka'ra's left at Tentia. He could see the recognition in the beast as it was barely containing itself.
Looking back at Ka'ra he nodded to her as he remembered her red hair and blue eyes. **"Ka'ra."** He started. as he looked over in the direction of the *Atin Oya'ka*. **"I heard from Malena that you had…"** He picked his words carefully. **"…Borrowed your fathers ship with little notice and haven't been in contact since"**
He looked at her watching for any reaction. **"I now it seems like a long way to come but your family is worried. Malena contacted me at your fathers request. He wants to know that you are alright and why you haven't been in contact."**

Ka'ra's reaction to Garin's word is slight, a small shift of her weight as she takes in his words. "**You mean he was worried what I was doing with his ship. The others, I admit, were probably worried,**" she says evenly, then glancing at the security detail waves them off being no longer needed. Two of them look to their leader who nods and the two leave, the leader remaining behind apparently to make sure no trouble was caused.
"**You have come a long way.. though how you found me, that's far more interesting to me at the moment,**" Ka'ra starts, apparently unperturbed that there was still guard remaining. Stepping back her helmeted head bobs to the side indicating she wanted Garin to follow. She sets a steady pace so Garin could catch up to walk beside her toward the *Atin Oya'ka*, the ramp closed. Her head turns to glance at him. Her tone lightens with humor as she adds, "**You always managed to have bad timing Garin… Can't say much has changed.**"

## Re: Seeking the Lost

### **Yogi** (2010-11-04 14:43:38)

Garin watched as she shifted slightly at the mention of her father and family. "You mean he was worried what I was doing with his ship. The others, I admit, were probably worried,"She said again with the same even tone. With a nod of her head he dismissed the security guards. His head turned as two of them walked away. The leader stayed behind seemingly to make sure all was alright.
"You have come a long way.. though how you found me, that's far more interesting to me at the moment," He smiled under his helmet as she stepped back and indicated with a bob of her head for him to follow. Being a few steps ahead of him Garin stepped quickly. His longer legs quickly caught him up to her. She lead him to the *Atin Oya'ka* where the ramp was up. Out of ear shot of her tone lightened as some humor leaked into her voice. Turning his head he saw her looking at him. "You always managed to have bad timing Garin... Can't say much has changed."
He gave her a short laugh. **"I can't say much about that. Del-Fin's show up at two times, the right time and the wrong time. It seems you have already taken your pick."** He paused for a moment. **"I wasn't lying when I said your father was worried about you. I got the impression he could care less about the ship to be honest. What's going on here?"** He didn't wast any time getting to the the meat of the conversation. Once that was over they could catch up.

The young Mandaolorian woman stops short of the ship, reaching out with slow, deliberate movements towards the panel to enter a code. "**I should be in a meeting right now**", she says in answer to what was going on and then doesn't say much else till the ramp has lowered, instead her head is turned toward Garin as if considering something. "**It's alright I suppose, I wasn't intending on going on this next mission,**" is all she says as she steps on board the very ship, Tentia racing past the two young humans' legs to get on first.
Ka'ra waits at the top of the ramp for her companion to follow her up, closing and locking down the ramp once he reaches her. "**I hope you're right about him not caring about the ship. I don't plan on giving it back any time soon,** The cargo bay is the first thing Garin sees when he boards the ship. Neatly stacked crates surround the outer walls and Garin spots a well used, yet well maintained speeder bike secure to the side. Tentia has already disappeared into the depths of the ship, passing through an opened airtight bulkhead out of the cargo bay proper. With the ramp closed, Ka'ra reaches up to take her helmet off, the seals hissing as they disengage.
The years since Garin had seen her last had certainly treated his friend's younger sister well, though the spark of her carefree nature and humor is still there, it seems to have been tempered by whatever hardships she's faced. Being a warrior himself, Garin can see a deep weariness and shadow of pain from injury from a recent battle. Not waiting for Garin to remark on anything, Ka'ra follows after the strill into the main sections of the ship.

### **Yogi** (2010-11-04 17:08:12)

Garin listened as Ka'ra was speaking about a meeting and lowering the ships ramp. "It's alright I suppose, I wasn't intending on going on this next mission," She spoke again. Turning his head from looking up the ramp he saw that she was looking at him. He was about to say something but Tentia raced past scampering up the ramp into the ship. He waited a few heart beats to follow then proceeded up the ramp following her.
Once at the top Garin looked around at the cargo bay as the ramp was brought up and locked down. Tentia, who was already out of sight, could still be heard through the bulkhead as it went to wherever it was heading. "I hope you're right about him not caring about the ship. I don't plan on giving it back any time soon."
Her voice brought him around. He saw her arms up releasing the seals on her helmet. Seeing her grown up face he smiled beneath his helmet as he spoke. **"I don't think you need to worry about it too much. He was worried. I think if he knew that you were alright it wouldn't be as big a deal."**
She was still as pretty as she always had been, just more grown up now. Releasing the seals on his own helmet the lifted it off over his head, his smile still in place as he looked at her. Short black hair that was a bit messy from the helmet was somewhat fixed as he ran a armored hand through it. Green eyes that shined bright from inner strength looked down at Ka'ra. He gave a short chuckle. **"You're not little Ka'ra anymore."** He said lightly as he tucked the helmet under his left arm. **"You mentioned a mission."**

Ka'ra's eyes light up as she looks back to peer at Garin, but then are hidden again as she walks down the hallway for the aft of the ship, a ladder set between the engines and two alcoves leading to the guns. Instead of the ladder she goes towards a door revealing a dormitory of five double bunks and a small living area. The dim lights flash on as she enters and she moves to take a seat in one of the couches. "**It's been over five yours, Garin. You can't expect me to be the same little girl,**" she says with some amusement, using it to hide how uncomfortable she seems sitting at the moment.
With a shake of her head she answers his question. "**The captain was requesting we go in search of a couple agents the Republic lost contact with. They were investigating Czerka's questionable activities and with Titan's Valiant being the closest vessel, wanted her to send a team to check it out.**" Her head cocks in question as she asks, "**So now that you've found me and passed on my father's displeasure and worry, what next?**"

### **Yogi** (2010-11-04 23:49:13)

"It's been over five yours, Garin. You can't expect me to be the same little girl," She said with a smile as she sat on one of the couches. Something about her movement nagged at him. She almost seemed stiff here and when her lifted her arm to unlock the ship. It wasn't the armor as it was like a second skin for all Mandalorians. He took a seat at the opposite end of the same couch and set his helmet between them.
***Maybe she was injured.*** He thought as she continued on answering his question. Confirming that she was working for the Republic. ***Typical that Czerka's involved. That corporation has its hands into just about everything it can.*** When she paused for a moment he looked at her. Seeing her head cocked to the side he had an idea what was coming next. "So now that you've found me and passed on my father's displeasure and worry, what next?"
Garin took in a breath and shook his head while giving a brief shrug. **"I don't know. I have some time on my hands right now. Which is why I'm here. I was already home for a few days when Malena contacted me. I was surprised to hear what had been going on. Though I wasn't totally out of the loop. It had only been about four to five months since I had spoken with her.** He paused for a moment as he smiled. **"To be honest I think she was a bit upset with your dad as I think she wanted me to be around for a bit but he wanted me to head off right away."**

## Re: Seeking the Lost

### **Alicia** (2010-11-05 00:25:01)

Garin's last comment seems to go over the young woman's head as her thoughts turn inward as she contemplates something. "**I was actually planning on heading back. I took on a young girl as a prospect to kir'man, but things have gotten rough and she's not ready to be in the field with me.**" She pauses for a moment before continuing. "**It seems these days I'm only returning home when I need something. Maybe I'll try to stay awhile, but I'm not sure how long I'll be able to.**" By her tone it seems she's more speaking aloud to herself than to Garin, expressing her thoughts on the matter of her family to someone she trusted.
"**How is my father?**" she asks slowly. "**When I was there last, I couldn't stand the sight of him. He barely even seemed to recognize I was there.**" She couldn't help to laugh at a thought. "**Though considering they were all rather stunned to see me, maybe he thought I was some phantasm.**"

Sitting there Garin watched and listened as Ka'ra talked. He appreciated the trust she showed him as she spoke freely. It seemed that she was trying to work through what had been on her mind lately. It was something that he understood all too well. In the presence of family one was able to let their guard down, be themselves without fear of reprisal. He let out a sigh as he relaxed there in the couch.
"How is my father?" She asked tentatively before continuing on.
He took a moment to before answering shifting on the couch they sat upon. **"He's been better but you already know that. I don't think he had been drinking as much when I was there a few weeks ago. From what Malena tells me it can vary depending if he has something to work on to occupy his mind.** He paused for a moment as he looked down to the deck plating of the *Atin Oya'ka* remembering his own involvement in the news that had been delivered to Jiles. He too missed Jalek who was more brother than friend. **"The loss of both your mother and Jalek so close together simply crushed him. I wish I could have spared him the news but I thought it was better if he heard about Jalek's death from me rather than someone else."**

Ka'ra shakes her head. "**We never blamed you for what came about. The news shocked all of us, but father… I guess he just wasn't strong enough. The war, losing so much he held dear, it was just too much for him to deal with.**" Ka'ra had been barely twelve years old when this had all happened, but it still seemed to be fresh in her mind. Maybe it had even been the start to when her exuberant and carefree nature had started to become jaded. "**There's no one else we would have wanted to hear it from…**" Ka'ra says at last after a pause and then shakes her head. Dwelling on her father wasn't going to change anything at the present time.
She flicks a strand of her red hair out of her face as she contemplates something. "**If you don't have any plans for awhile… Maybe you'd like to take my place on this mission?**"

## Re: Seeking the Lost

### **Yogi** (2010-11-05 11:42:26)

Garin nodded slightly as her kind words. What she said was true It wasn't the messenger of the bad news that sent Jiles into a tail spin. It was the news that did it all by itself. He looked at her as she sat there talking. Gone was the carefree girl he once knew. ***Little Ka'ra*** He sometimes teased her with the name. Though she often yelled at him for it didn't seem to bother her all that much, at least when he said it. A small smile appeared on his face as he watched her lick a loose strand of red hair from her face. ***Not so little anymore indeed.*** His thought echoed what he had said to her earlier.
"If you don't have any plans for awhile... Maybe you'd like to take my place on this mission?"
Raising a dark eyebrow he cocked his head to the side. **"I could help out if its needed but I thought you just said you were going to stay. You looking to part ways so soon?"**

## Re: Seeking the Lost

### **Alicia** (2010-11-05 11:52:44)

"**Was going to see how long I could stay at the yaim…**" Ka'ra begins to explain. "**Emily can't stay here and home is the only place she can be safe and learn what she needs to. I'll probably leave when the team does, going my separate way for a time. If they want me to go I will, but I doubt they'd need me, especially if you decide to go.**"
Mimicking his own questioning glance she asks, "**Prius was authorized to compensate the team if that's a factor.**" Five years had been a long time and it wasn't like he had been corresponding with her all that time.

---

## Re: Seeking the Lost

### **Yogi** (2010-11-05 12:53:54)

Garin nodded at the mention of compensation. **"It is one factor and I could use the credits. Your father let me borrow the fighter so its not like I can sell it."** He said with a smirk.
He sat there for a moment thinking it over. **"This Captain doesn't know me so that may not sit well replacing an existing member of a team with someone new.** He grabbed his helmet and looked at her. **"All we can do is ask. To be honest though it would be nice to catch up with you."**

---

## Re: Seeking the Lost

### **Alicia** (2010-11-05 13:28:11)

Ka'ra smirks at his remark, "**Well, considering I'm the one who made up the current team I doubt the captain will have much of an issue. Technically, she's borrowing the team for a mission the Republic thrust on her.**"
She half shrugs then, "**If you want to participate, it would just be a matter of catching the tale end of the briefing so you can meet the others.**" Anticipating his response she stands, grabbing her helmet from where she put it beside her. Her eyebrows raise in question, waiting to see if his interest holds. "**There's time enough to catch up, I'm not planning on going anywhere anytime soon.**" She laughs as she adds, "**Well except for home for a few days.**"

## Re: Seeking the Lost

### **Yogi** (2010-11-05 14:04:07)

Garin nodded as he stood up after she did. **"Alright then lets go talk to this Captain of yours. Lets hope she pays well. The services of a Del-Fin don't come cheap.** He laughed as he began to move back through the way he just came through.
Listening to her talk about going home for a few days made him pause and look at her. The brow wrinkle that appeared when he became serious came forth. **"I want yo to know that your father really was worried about you. and not the ship. At least he was when I was talking with him. So don't be too hard on him ok?"** He raised his eyebrows, making the wrinkle even more noticable, while giving her a slight nod of his head to make sure she understood. The tone in his voice changed. **"One other thing since you're going home. Do you think you can get Malena to get off her shebs and come see me. She's not the only one who wants to be seen."** He gave her a smirk and a wink as he resumed walking.

## Re: Seeking the Lost

### **Alicia** (2010-11-05 14:19:44)

Ka'ra laughs, a high musical sound. Sobering slightly she remarks, "**I'll be sure to tell her. Maybe, if the captain lets me I'll bring her back for a small visit, though that also depends on whether you plan on sticking around here.**" Sobering more, she says. "**There's work to be done, and I have to admit it would be nice to have you around. Though I can't say the pay will be very good.**" Reaching the ramp, she puts her helmet back on before reaching out to the console to lower it.
Glancing up from the bottom of the lowered ramp was the guard assigned as the leader of the small detail. Apparently he felt it a remiss in his duties to leave the stranger alone till told otherwise. Ka'ra gives the guard a nod of acknowledgement as she passes, though gets nothing in response from the guard. Waiting for Garin to catch up, she sets her path toward the main corridor of the cruiser and then to the lift, setting the level of where they're going. Turning into a constant shadow, the guard of course follows behind.

## Re: Seeking the Lost

### **Yogi** (2010-11-05 14:53:36)

Reaching the ramp they stopped. As Ka'ra was beginning to put her helmet back on he readied his own. **"I'll tell you what. You tell Malena that if she comes out I'll make sure to stay around. As for the pay, credits are credits. I'll take what I can get. It's not like there is a lot going on right now."**
As Ka'ra hit the ramp button he placed his helmet back on and secured it down. Descending the ramp just behind his "little sister" he wasn't surprised that the guard was still in place and gave him a nod as he passed following Ka'ra to wherever she was taking him. ***This will certainly be different. Working with Republic forces and not against them. How times change.*** He thought as he turned around in the lift. Seeing that the guard was still fulfilling his duty Garin once again simply nodded to the man.

## Re: Seeking the Lost

### **Alicia** (2010-11-05 15:19:36)

Ka'ra waits for the two men to enter the lift before sending it on it's course to a level above the hanger bay. With her helmet on it's hard to tell where her gaze is, whether at the door, the console or even continuing to look at Garin. Finally the doors open and she steps out, continuing to lead the way. She stops outside a door, and signals Garin and his shadow to wait. "**I'm going to speak with them first,**" she explains, her voice booming out through the amplification speakers in her armor.
The guard settles into a stance nearby, his rifle aimed at the ground but his gaze watchful.

## Re: Seeking the Lost

### **Alicia** (2010-11-06 20:05:15)

Garin doesn't have to wait long. It seems no sooner does Ka'ra disappear through the door that another comes out. Dressed in the crisp naval uniform of a Republic officer, it's clear this no-nonsense woman is used to being in charge. Giving the Mandalorian a nod, she passes him by heading toward the direction of the lift.
He can see now that the door leads into the briefing room, and with it still open, seems to be an open invitation for him to enter.

## Re: Seeking the Lost

### **Yogi** (2010-11-07 21:49:17)

Garin stood outside the door next to the wall. The Republic trooper, who had been his shadow, was still close by with weapon in hand though it was pointed down towards the deck. The trooper kept an eye on him but didn't seem to out of sorts. He was alert and watchful but the Mandalorian figured that since Ka'ra as given him the sign he wasn't on full alert.
The sound of a door opening to his right caused him to turn his head to look and see if it was Ka'ra. It wasn't. Instead the was a middle aged woman in a uniform that look very uncomfortable. Judging by her rank insignia he figured her for the captain Ka'ra spoke of. Only giving him a simple nod she quickly walked past towards the lift that he only recently just exited. Looking back to the door and seeing that it was left open he moved from his position and gave his shadow a nod before walking through the door.
