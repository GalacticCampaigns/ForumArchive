# Introduction to Blue Booking

### **Alicia** (2010-07-06 16:45:31)

The idea for Blue Booking came from seeing it used in a couple of Sketchpad's campaigns. This is to give players the opportunity for something to do outside of the main story. Blue Booking should be something that ties into the main story, but effects a single character.
It's intended as a one-shot or short adventure and if wished can include more than one player from the campaign to become involved.
Not all heroes will be Blue Booking, but anyone interested should submit an idea to the GM for consideration. Blue Booking usually has something to do with a character's background (Something from the past coming to light or going in search of a lost relative. It does not include RPing out events from a character's past. Such is left to a character's background) or a back plot of the main game and should in some way be connected to it.
