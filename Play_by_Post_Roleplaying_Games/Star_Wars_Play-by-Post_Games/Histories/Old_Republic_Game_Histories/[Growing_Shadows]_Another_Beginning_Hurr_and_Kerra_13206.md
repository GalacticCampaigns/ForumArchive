# [Growing Shadows] Another Beginning: Hurr and Kerra

### **Alicia** (2008-06-30 05:20:54)

[hide]songgirl134 (1:23 AM): Hurr, it's been a couple years since you left Tattooine and since it's been awhile since Davis? had sent a bounty hunter after you. Wondering how your old employer Vorga is doinf you return to Tatooine.
songgirl134 (1:39 AM): Kinsos: For one reason or another, your travels have brought you to Tattooine. It could be this is a resting point before you move onto your next "gut feeling".
songgirl134 (1:08 AM): Either way you both arrive at a cantina. Hurr remembers this place having been run by Vorga
"SaberWolf" (1:45 AM): The cantina was the same as well, so he moved straight to the bar to see the bartender. His hands never strayed far from his blaster, though this was hidden by his cloak. His eyes continued to search the room for signs of trouble.
"Kinsos" (1:46 AM): Kerra walks into the cantina and tries to stay as out of site as possible. He finds a small table in a corner and sits observing the band
songgirl134 (1:08 AM): THe bartender looks up at Hurr when he approaches cleaning a glass with a dusty looking rag. "Ya? What will it be?"
songgirl134 (1:32 AM): The bar is fairly busy, most of the patrons appear to be regulars. Hurr recognizes a few from his days fighting in the arena.
"SaberWolf" (1:28 AM): Looking to the bartender he nods his head. "One Bantha Blue." He glances around the cantina a little more and then leans in closer. "How is Vorga doing these days.
songgirl134 (1:17 AM): the bartender begins mixing the drink and sets before Hurr "Could be better as long as those Czerka slunkies stay out of his business."
"Kinsos" (1:25 AM): Kerra makes his way over to the bar and sits growls deeply trying to get the attention of someone to bring him a drink
songgirl134 (1:19 AM): The bartender looks at Kerra and scowls at the Wookie. He says "What do you want?"
"Kinsos" (1:32 AM): Kerra grunts and growls a few times..."Bantha Blaster for me"
songgirl134 (1:51 AM): The bartender obvioulst doesn't understand you.
"Kinsos" (1:18 AM): Kerra sighs inwardly and points to a bottle behind the bar
"SaberWolf" (1:38 AM): Glancing to the tender he smiles. "He wants a Bantha Blaster...so Vorga in real trouble?" He smiles and nods to the wookie.
"Kinsos" (1:10 AM): Kerra looks at the other surprised to be understood...but thankful
songgirl134 (1:12 AM): The bartender grunts and reaches for a glass and pours a glass of the liquer
songgirl134 (1:09 AM): "THe republic banned the death matches Vorga is so fond of and they have been pressuring Czerka to enforce it."
"SaberWolf" (1:23 AM): Nodding he knows that Vorga was overfond of them...that is what got him in trouble though. "It would...that is were most of the money is...or so I hear."
songgirl134 (1:28 AM): The bartender grunts "The duels and the swoop races where the only things profitable on this planet. And now there's a bunch of restrictions."
"SaberWolf" (1:16 AM): Taking another sip from the glass he sighs and then looks around again. "Came through here a number of years ago and saw a few matches. Was picking up a cargo for a man named...Davis I think it was."
songgirl134 (1:05 AM): "Davis.. Davis..."
songgirl134 (1:55 AM): "Hmm... aw yes Davis. Had some trouble few years ago with one of Vorga's duelers."
songgirl134 (1:49 AM): THe bartenders eyes narrow on Hurr for a moment before he picks up another glass and the dusty rag and begins cleaning it.
"SaberWolf" (1:05 AM): Hurr just shrugs as the man replies. "Heard about that from him...he almost did not let me take his cargo. Heard the person was caught though shortly after he left planet."
"SaberWolf" (1:08 AM): He was hoping that Davis might have be dead...didn't seem that way.
songgirl134 (1:06 AM): THe bartender doesn't seem to care that Hurr just lied to him.
"Kinsos" (1:11 AM): Kerra decides that this conversation is of no interest to him anymore and he gets up to take a look around the Cantina
"SaberWolf" (1:25 AM): Downing the last of his drink he slips some creds across the bar. "Thanks for the drink." He starts to move in the direction of the door, noting the wookie has moved as well.
songgirl134 (1:28 AM): Kerra: as you look around the cantina you notice that the tables around the entrance as 2 humans walk in. One male and a female.
songgirl134 (1:43 AM): bah.. they grow quiet
"Kinsos" (1:45 AM): Kerra will scratch his fur covered head and begins to make his way towards the door decideing to take a look around town before he trys to find another ship off this planet
songgirl134 (2:03 AM): Hurr you notice the same thing, only now they are heading towards the bar. As they pass tables the patrons grow quiet/
"Kinsos" (2:42 AM): Kerra looks back at the sudden silence and watches the two as they walk towards the bar
"SaberWolf" (2:10 AM): Slipping slightly to the side he tries to blend in a little more with the small crowd, pulling his cloak a little tighter. His eyes rove over both with a discerning eye.
songgirl134 (2:35 AM): They take a seat at the bar and badger the tender for their obvious usual drink.
"Kinsos" (2:33 AM): Kerra loses sight of the Cat being and he looks around for him for a few seconds then returns his attention to the two at the bar
songgirl134 (2:32 AM): THe woman turns to look around the bar and she smiles at the patrons.
"Jason Smith" (2:28 AM): Atomsk looks around as he swigs his drink and the smiles and he cracks his knuckles above his haed and goes back to drinking
"SaberWolf" (2:41 AM): Hurr pauses by the door and waits for a few seconds though he stays near the shadows. His right hand has slid down to touch the grip of his blaster. He is all nerves since coming back here...a bad idea, maybe.
songgirl134 (2:56 AM): THe woman glances at the man beside her "Lookie Canti. They must know who we are."
songgirl134 (2:45 AM): She turns back to her drink still smiling and takes a drink
"Jason Smith" (2:51 AM): Atomsk sighs "Jace I told you I don't go by that name any more, but your right. So do i get to fight them?" he asks with a smile as he stands up
"Kinsos" (2:18 AM): Kerra grins at this, He looks back to see Hurr at the door...he grunts to him and motions for Hurr to come stand with him
"SaberWolf" (2:40 AM): The talk by the man and the fact that he stands, leads him to slip his other hand down to the grip of his other blaster. A drink and a quick visit with Vorga...that is all he wanted.
songgirl134 (2:46 AM): "Hmm, that sounds like fun. But we both know all these men here are cowards. Maybe we should raise the prize money... Again."
songgirl134 (2:18 AM): SHe says this nonchalantly as she takes another drink
"SaberWolf" (2:35 AM): Glacing in the direction of the wookie he slips through the bar to come up beside him. Staying slightly back as he listens to the talks by the woman. Interesting to say the least...but who are they?
"Kinsos" (2:31 AM): Kerra lets his hand slide down to his lightsaber...if these fools wanted a fight they were going to get one
"Jason Smith" (2:12 AM): Atomsk laughs "Again? wow you really don't think much of them do you but you've got a point. Thats why I leave you in charge. Alright how high do you think we have to bump it up to to get them to fight?" he asked with a big grin
"Jason Smith" (2:33 AM): "We may have to sell a ship to get theis weaklings to fight"
songgirl134 (2:00 AM): Jace puts her glass down, now empty and turns to the assembled patrons. "So.. who is up or the challange. 25,000 credits for a simple match. Won't even be to the death."
"Kinsos" (2:01 AM): Kerra looks extremely confused...who is asking for money to make him fight?
songgirl134 (2:57 AM): Looks at Atomsk "That's double the winnings og last
songgirl134 (2:08 AM): of the last offer if you remember."
"SaberWolf" (2:32 AM): Hurr can feel his fingers twitch as he hears the proposition. His mind starts to run through the numbers in his head as he further looks over the man, sizing him up...you have got to know the odds boy.
"Jason Smith" (2:46 AM): "True and we both know my memory is not the best, but I have yet to meet someone who could win" he sais and he takes his blue jacket off reavling the rest of his red armor
songgirl134 (2:01 AM): Jace smiles at the man then cracks her knuckles as she turns back to the crowd sizing them up.
songgirl134 (2:29 AM): Everyone int he cantina is silent and even the bartender seem nervous
"Jason Smith" (2:26 AM): "Come on some hast to want that 25,000, hell I'll raise it to 30,000. There has to be someone here who gutsy enough to try"
"SaberWolf" (2:35 AM): Glancing to a patron off to his left he nods his head in the direction of the man and woman. "What is this about?" He tries to keep his voice low enough to not draw too much attention.
songgirl134 (2:56 AM): The patron looks at Hurr startled for a moment. "They are Vorga's reigning champs. THey come in here every once in awhile looking for fresh blood."
"SaberWolf" (2:03 AM): "So they are duelist for Vorga." He glances back to the man. "Have you seen them in action?" His question implies a little bit of extra information.
songgirl134 (2:34 AM): Jace continues looking through the crowd and she spots Hurr. "I guess we are going to have to do this the hard way. "
"Jason Smith" (2:32 AM): Atomsk sighs "I really didn't want to have to do this....ok I did but I want to seam like i was some what of a nice guy"
songgirl134 (2:46 AM): Description for Jace: Standing at average height, she sports shoulder length blonde hair which is usually pulled back into a ponytail.
songgirl134 (2:47 AM): Her green eyes are always moving looking for a dangerous situation. Wearing a black tanktop and pants, her only visible weapon is a heavy blaster pistol that is rarely fired. Instead her main weapons are her weighted fists.
"Jason Smith" (2:30 AM): Appearance:
Atomsk is 6'9' and weigh about 113kg. He has long black hair down to his lower back and bright green eyes. His armor is red with yellow circles, around a black triangle, on the shoulders.
"Jason Smith" (2:32 AM): He normally wares a blue jacket or a faded blue cloak over his armor and he has tattoos of black flames that start on his wrist and go up his elbows and a strange scar on his face
songgirl134 (2:42 AM): Jace glances at Atmosk, "I thought you wanted a fight?"
songgirl134 (2:16 AM): PAtron to Hurr: "Ya, I've seen them. They are pretty tough, especially as a pair."
"Jason Smith" (2:26 AM): "I do I just hate fighing cowards, thats all"
"SaberWolf" (2:31 AM): Not liking the direction this is going he glances around a little but resigns himself to the inevitable. One little fight here and everyone will know he is back.
songgirl134 (2:12 AM): "Looks like this bunch has been tapped out. Shame really."
"Kinsos" (2:31 AM): Kerra looks to hurr...he grunts a few times "Are we going to let them keep insulting us?"
songgirl134 (2:41 AM): Jace says to Atmosk, putting a few credits on the counter.
"SaberWolf" (2:17 AM): He is already thumbing the stun setting on both his pistols, though he has not drawn anything yet. He is resigned to let them make the first move...though he does look at the wookie. "Hey...it is a gamble...you want to take it?"
"Jason Smith" (2:01 AM): "What that fur ball? I didn't quit catch that. Why dont you go back home and curl up next to a tree" Atomsk says with a big smile
"Kinsos" (2:03 AM): "No but I'm not one to stand for puny humans insulting me"
"Kinsos" (2:52 AM): Kerra lets out a huge roar and beats his chest raising his chin in defiance to the human he stands eye to eye with
"SaberWolf" (2:07 AM): Shrugging he nods his head. "I got your back." He waits for the wookie to make the first move...which might not be long.
songgirl134 (2:11 AM): "Hmm.. looksie like you found yourself a sparring partner, Chanti." She seems to sing to Atmosk.
"Kinsos" (2:18 AM): Kerra grunts and growls "If you want to have your arms torn from your body continue to insult me fool"
"SaberWolf" (2:20 AM): Glancing back to the wookie he smiles again. "I should warn you...I am a wanted man here." He can feel the twitching of his fingers grow.
"Jason Smith" (2:23 AM): Atomsk just smiles "Hey I think we've got a taker Jace" he says lookith the Wookie in the eye "Come on you walking carpet. Give us a kiss"
songgirl134 (2:04 AM): "We shouldn't fight here. You know how mad Vorga will get."
"Kinsos" (2:43 AM): Kerra bares his teeth and takes out his lightsaber activating it and moves forward..."we fight here you fool...you wanted this fight and now you have it"
"Jason Smith" (2:54 AM): "Yeah you're right once agian. Sorry i tend to let things slip my mind"
"Kinsos" (2:45 AM): Kerra growls more "What are you afraid to fight now you fool? You talk big now back it up you coward"
"SaberWolf" (2:07 AM): Shaking his head he tries to reason with the wookie. "Hey...let us earn the whole prize and not have to give half of it away to the bartender."
songgirl134 (2:40 AM): Jace takes a defensive stance. "Hah! Now they are calling us the cowards."
"Kinsos" (2:02 AM): "I'm not here for a prize I fight to take back my honor
"Kinsos" (2:28 AM): Kerra looks back to Hurr "Are you sure..."
"Jason Smith" (2:55 AM): Atomsk jumps back "So this fool doesn't like to fight with his hands" he says as he smiles "Good it will make beating you to a pulp all the better,
"Jason Smith" (2:56 AM): but I'm not fighting you here. I dont pull random people into my fights, you want to really fight me then we go outside
"SaberWolf" (2:01 AM): Glancing to the wookie he shakes his head. "I will remember you said that if we win." He figures that his hiding is just about over anyways. "Vorga has a dueling house...why not there?"
"SaberWolf" (2:58 AM): "The name is Hurr by the way." It is a lousy way to introduce yoursel...but it will have to do.
songgirl134 (2:32 AM): "Hurr..." JAce seems to purr still in a defensive stance next to Atmosk
"Kinsos" (2:01 AM): Kerra roars "Fine I will break you there you fools, Well met Hurr...My name could not be said by your race but you may call me Kerra"
"Jason Smith" (2:10 AM): "Now now Jace we have to leave first so we don't trash another bar"
"Kinsos" (2:26 AM): Kerra Stands aside with his lightsaber still glowing..."Lead the way"
songgirl134 (2:20 AM): Jace steps back and stands up straight rolling her shoulders, keeping a wary eye on Kerra's lightsaber. Then she turns and beams at Atmosk. "This should be fun."
"Kinsos" (2:50 AM): Kerra chuckles "If you enjoy dying then yes it will be fun"
songgirl134 (2:10 AM): "OO... a death match? Been awhile for one of those too."
"SaberWolf" (2:24 AM): Hurr lets out a groan at the very mention. That is what got him into trouble the first time. "If I live...I may never be able to come back here." He moves towards the door and steps outside, shaking slightly.
songgirl134 (2:30 AM): Then she leans in toward Kerra as if to whisper but ends up saying loudly "Better not let Czerka hear you or they will ruin all the fun."
"Jason Smith" (2:31 AM): Atomsk smiles even bigger and then pats Jace on the head "they have so much to learn dont thay" he says as he walked out "This way to get beat to a fracking pulp" he said almost as if he was leading little kids
songgirl134 (2:17 AM): Jace laughs with glee as she follows behind him
"Kinsos" (2:48 AM): Kerra deactivates his lightsaber and follows behind the humans. He talks softly to Hurr "I can fight in close combat...How can we best help each other in this fight
"SaberWolf" (2:04 AM): "You give me room to maneuver and I can pick my shots as needed...if I have to join in close." He simply shrugs as it is not something he thinks about too much.
"SaberWolf" (2:55 AM): "I can still be of use...but not as much." Though he knows the way to Vorga's place he will let the other two lead. At least he will get to see the hutt.
"SaberWolf" (2:04 AM): Glancing sideways at the wookie he shivers. "I will only be using stun settings though..." He does not bother to explain why.
"Kinsos" (2:31 AM): Kerra nods "I will be using kill Settings...how much further?"
songgirl134 (2:55 AM): As you round a corner you can see your destination. The arena is a large and extravegant affair. More so than how Hurr remmebers it. Apparently it had been expanded to allow for a larger audience.
"SaberWolf" (2:11 AM): ooc: See, mention one little death match and you get an audience.
songgirl134 (2:44 AM): Jace and Atmosk lead you through a side entrance and into the fighting area.
"SaberWolf" (2:05 AM): Looks like Vorga has been doing rather well for himself. This thought brings a smile to his face at least for a couple of minutes.
songgirl134 (2:15 AM): The stands slowly start to fill as news of the match spread throughout the town.
"Kinsos" (2:53 AM): Kerra says to Jace.."you have 5 minutes, then we fight"
"Jason Smith" (2:17 AM): "Looks like a full hous Jace, it's been a wile sence we've goten one. This is going to really good
songgirl134 (2:36 AM): Jace beams at the wookie then begins doing a few warm stretches.
songgirl134 (2:52 AM): warm up stretches*
"SaberWolf" (2:04 AM): Moving off to the side, he slips off his cloak and folds it. Laying that down he also lays the bandolier on it as well. As he is doing this he glances around for Vorga.
"Kinsos" (3:06 AM): Kerra takes out his lightsaber and activates it once again...he gives a wookie war cry and starts to promtly walk towards Asmosk...He gives him a nod of the head and raises his lightsaber preparing to attack
"Jason Smith" (3:47 AM): Atomsk adjusthis his armor and throws a few quick punches "I can't wait, a death match and with a wookie. I'm really going to enjoy myself"
"Kinsos" (3:18 AM): ((initiative?)
"Kent Billen" (3:45 AM): ((i go first and every one else afterwards))
songgirl134 (3:09 AM): Jace takes a defensive position a few meters away from Atmosk but facing the wookie, she smirks. 'A Wookie JEdi no less."
songgirl134 (3:22 AM): ARound the arena the stands begin to erupt in cheers

Jace opens her eyes and looks back at the guards as Kerra begins to regain consciousness. "Only if we had killed one of you. We are in the arena after all" she smiles.
Standing Jace walks to stand beside Atmosk as she watches the guards approach. "This should prove interesting."

Atomsk looks at the other two and then looks back at the guards "You ok Jace, you took a few hit back there?" he asked as he balled up his fists "You really thing they'll want to fight?" he asked as he looked at the guards and then looked at Jace

### **Alicia** (2008-06-30 14:21:49)

"I'm fine." Jace regards the guards with a pout. "They certainly mean business."
As she speaks the guards are now about 10 meters away and they each hold a weapon at the ready, though they are not pointed at any of the combatants. The Czerka guards almost seem afraid of these two and are trying not to show it.

Jace doesn't seem to hear Kerra as she continues to look at the approaching guards, she then turns to look up at a private spectator box. After a moment she sighs and turns her attention back to the guards a bit disappointed. She says quietly so only Kerra, Hurr and Atmosk can hear her. "Looks like we will have to talk through this. Shame really. These Czerka flunkies need to be taught some manners." She smiles pleasantly at them.

Hurr had not bothered to put back his pistols and without much thought, he thumbs them both off their stun setting. "Talking huh...want that I should see if they are going to let us go?" As he looks to Jace he swallows as he thinks of what he just said and then moves a little closer.
His voice lowers as he speaks so that only those closest to him...most likely Jace, Kerra and Atmosk. "I should warn you that there was a bounty put out on my head by a noble named Davis. He happens to live here on the planet or at least I figure he still does." It might not be a good idea for him to try and talk their way out of this but he is willing to give it a try at least. His tail twitches back and forth under his cloak, the stun baton still clutch in it.

Atomsk looks at the guards and takes a deep breath "Aww, but...ehhh alright." he says as he drops his shoulders and looks down at the ground "Well we may have to talk our way out, but that dosen't mean we can't scare the crap out of them" he says as he cracks his knuckles and smiles looking at the guards like that were fresh meat

Kerra stands tall and walks next to Jace trying to be as intimidating as possible...then he looks to Hurr grunting a few words to him "How do we get out of this, I'm not much of a talker..."

Jace continues to watch the guards as the grow nearer. "Vorga will take care of them. We have only to wait." The guards stop 9 meters away within range to use a blaster piston set on stun. That is assuming their weapons are on stun.
Jace still smiling at the guards says, "Hello boys. Nice day for a fight don't you think?" A few of the guards shift uncomfortably.
The leader of the guards takes a step forward and addresses the four of you. "It has come to Czerka's attention there was to be a death match..." He is cut off when a Twi'lek that Hurr recognizes as one of Vorga's lieutenants enters and yells across the arena. "Death match? I don't see any dead combatants." The guards turn to the new arrival and the leader's eyes narrow at the Twi'lek. When he gets closer he looks at Hurr stunned for a moment then continues. "I think someone was pulling your chain again constable. Vorga doesn't appreciate you interferring in a *legal* match. If you recall there was one scheduled for today. Vorga is willing to overlook Czerka's trangression if you would leave the arena. You are of course welcome to take up your concerns with Vorga himself."
The guards look a mixture of relief and anger at the lieutenants words and the leader agrees to pull back his squad and speak with Vorga.
Jace watches them as the leave a smile still playing on her face. "One of these days..."
The Twi'lek lingers in the arena and addresses all of you (his eyes lingering on Hurr for a moment) and the audience and says "This match has been postponed for a later time." Around the arena the spectators grumble and start to make for the exit after collecting whatever bets they had managed to procure.
Jace heaves a heavy sigh as she watches the arena empty.

Hurr nods to the twi'lek though he is not sure if he remembers him or not. He figures he should remember his name but is unable to come up with it at the moment. Glancing to the guards as the start to retreat he sighs a little in relief.
Glancing to the crowd as they start to filter out he cannot help but shake his head in wonder...partly at the feeling that holds him and partly because he realizes that he could still be in real trouble. Glancing back to the twi'lek he shrugs his shoulders under his cloak, as his tail slips the stun baton back into the sheath behind his back. "Vorga by chance willing to meet an old friend?" He still counts the hutt as a friend, heck it had been Vorga that was responsible for him getting off the planet and keeping his hide intact.

Kerra looks to Hurr, "where would I be able to get a flight off planet?"

The Twi'lek stops to look at Hurr saying. "And who should I tell him has come?"

Smiling he shrugs. "Simply tell him the Night is back...he'll understand." He is sure that Vorga will not have forgotten him as he has heard from him a couple of times over the past few years. Some of it to see how he was doing and the other half to get him to work for him in new businesses off world.
Glancing to Kerra he shakes his head. "The only place would be the spaceport or one of the local cantinas...but you might just have better luck here." Glancing again to the twi'lek he laughs. "Though we may have to do something for Vorga and it might compromise your scruples a little Jedi." The last bit is said a little lower so those closest can hear but his voice will not carry that far.

The Twi'lek nods."Vorga will be informed of your arrival." He turns to Jace and Atmosk for a moment before motioning you all to follow. He doesn't wait to see if you comply instead he heads toward where you had originally entered and heads into a stairway. Jace looks at Atmosk a moment then smiles, shrugging then follows behind. As she walks she brushes the dust off from the arena.

Hurr nods his head as the twi'lek speaks and then turns to follow when he starts to walk away. He glances sideways at both Jace and Atmosk with s slight smile. "So, you working to keep the Czerka scum in place?" He hopes they are doing at least a little to help out as he holds no grudges against Vorga. "Exactly how has business been for Vorga with Czerka trying to cramp his style?" They seem like safe and innocent questions though he is not sure what Kerra will be thinking of them.
He shakes himself lightly to get rid of some of the arena dust from his fur and clothing. Clothing, there was a new idea that he had taken to with some trepidation. The anticipation builds as he follows along with the others and the twi'lek...there is also just a touch of fear as well.

Kerra looks extremely confused, Czerka is a legitimate company, and they work to better the republic. He gives up on trying to follow the conversation of the others and simply follows along hoping to find a way off this planet.

(( To move this along and bring you now into the main thread this is what I'm proposing happens. If there is anything you wish to add please to do so. ))
After speaking with Vorga and catching up on old times, (not to mention offered a rematch to fight Canti and Atmosk once more, not a fatal fight this time) Jace offers to take you to your next destination. She is feeling rather bored with this still barren and lifeless planet and wants to get out. Having a ship she and Atmosk have purchased they are all set to go. (It is up to Jason whether Atmosk will come along or stay.)
Assuming you agree, you all travel together for a time until Kerra hears rumors about a desolate planet in the outer regions that strange things happen on. The man had brought back a small souvenir that Kerra recognizes as a Sith artifact. Jace would be easily persuaded to take the two of you.
The planet is of course Rhen Var. Mush to Jace's displeasure when you arrive the ship ends up crashing on the planets surface. Jace, who is no mechanic, realizes there is no way she can get the ship off the planet's surface. Even if replacement parts were to be found. Kerra sets out to find the source of the rumors.
Finding the tomb is rather difficult, Jace and Kerra eventually do sense where it lies though the Dark Side energy that once permeated the place is steadily disappearing. If you still have descriptions of the place, they would come into play now.
The last room you find is Saalo Morn's burial chamber. On the floor near the sarcophagus is a cleaved in two helm. The lid on the sarcophagus has been removed exposing a mummy and treasure lying beneath it.

I have decided that Canti Atmosk did not survive the crash but Jace did.
Kerra soon after finding the last crypt you sense two more Force Sensitives enter the tomb.
((since Saberwolf has not been on for awhile we will continue without him))
You can go ahead and move to the regular thread now.
