# [Flames of War]Chapter One: Old flames sparks anew

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-06-07 10:48:49)

*When the terrible war with Exar Kun ended, the Galaxy seemed like it would be able to enjoy a brief period of peace for a change. The Dark Lord of the Sith was defeated, and his minions were scattered and lost. However, new horrors would brew on the jungle moon of Dxun. The Mandalorian clans, serving Exar Kun in the war, had regrouped, and bided their time. And that rime has come. From Dxun, Mandalore the Ultimate has now lead his Neo-Crusaders in a fierce campaign against the Republic. The superior battle prowess, tactical skills, and sheer intensity of the Mandalorian assault forced the Republic back. In this hour of need, the Republic pleaded to the Jedi Council for help, but the council adviced caution, still having the memory of the war with Exar Kun fresh in mind. This decision did not sit well with many of the knights in the order, and finally, one decided to act. Against the wishes of the Jedi Council, a knight named Revan began recruiting others to help him fight the Mandalorians. Many heeded his call, and among them are five young jedi, nothing more than padawans, who have been sent to the world of Myrkr, to help the small republic colony there prepare if the Mandalorians should come that way…*
You are all sitting aboard a small shuttle, en route to Myrkr. You have come for different reasons, but the common trait between you is that you have shared RevanÂ´s conviction that the Mandalorians must be fought, and that the jedi can not sit idly by. You are headed for a small colony of republic citizens, guarded by a garrison of forces, and quite susceptible to a possible Mandalorian attack. You have been told to make contact with captain Hussar, the trandoshan leader of MyrkrÂ´s defenses.

Fretter sits away from the others with his hood pulled far over his head, hiding his facial features. He looks to the others crowding the small passenger space available to them. He smirks and rests his hand on his lightsaber hilt, his distrust for others taking control of his instincts. He looks to each of them trying to size them up, but to little avail, just another thing he was unable to learn before his late master passed, it seemed the only thing he was able to best his master at was in combat with a lightsaber. His smirk immediately turned to a sneer at the thought of his late master, Ser'dun had left him alone in the Galaxy as far as he was concerned, and though his love for his Master had run deep, he felt resentment for all the things he was never taught.
He gives up on trying to read the other Padawan's thoughts and body language, it seemed the only time he was good at that was when he was in the heat of battle. He leaned back against the wall of the Ship and waited for the Shuttle to pull into the spaceport where he would be helping the citizens of this defenseless world, defend themselves.
He looked once more to the other Jedi riding along with him in the ship. He had to give them some respect, for they were here for the same purpose he was and that was to fight the Mandalorians, and though he knew they had their different reasons for doing so, at least they were taking action...he respected that. But again he smirked at the thought of the others in battle, if they thought it was full of glory they would be in for a surprise. He had only seen the Mandalorians in battle twice before and they were ruthless killers. He had witnessed the massacre of a defenseless town on a outer rim world that had made no signs of aggression towards anyone, and he had watched as a Mandalorian raiding party had swooped in on another town and he and his master had come to the rescue of those people. There his Master had died, and now he was here to fight again. He felt his anger rising at just the thought of the cowardly Mandalorians. He would make sure that all Mandalorians that raised their weapons against the Republic would perish.
He folded his arms and leaned back, he waited calmly for the Shuttle to pull in port, there he could begin anew as a soldier for the army Revan was creating. He was done worrying about the Jedi's teachings, he was here to defend the helpless people of the Galaxy, and often that involved violence. He didn't have time to worry about following the Jedi code. He acted on his own now.

Sitting opposite the mysterious Jedi in black robes, Dreti rotates each eye separately around the cabin, taking in the sights. He studies each passenger for mere moments, not more than what he hoped would be taken as polite, and settles further into his seat smoothing out his white robes with his hands.
After a moment, he inhales as he slowly shuts his eyes, and as he exhales he reaches out his senses trying to connect to the ebb and flow of the Force, trying to get a feel for those around him.
Another few moments spent quiet in meditation span heartbeats for him, curious about what he feels, he pulls out a datapad, waggles his barbels in thought, and scribbles some notes while clearing his throat.
**"Hmm, not to intrude, but does anyone know more about our destination? I left in a rush from the Hospital and did not have time to conduct due diligence and research on our destination as throughly as I would have liked."**
He waits patiently for a response.

Lor is a young man approximatly 1.7m tall. He has very fragile features. He wears a veil across his eyes. Lor looks at the speaker through the force. He ponders what he sees for a brief moment before speaking.
"I believe we are headed to the planet Myrkr. I know little about the world specifically but my research revealed that in ancient tongues the word Myrkr means Dark. It seems a fitting place to clash with the Mandolorians."

Sitting near the rear of the craft, Teraphor leans back in his seat, glancing around himself at the shuttle's occupants. Nervously, he removes his lightsaber from his belt and looks at it, focusing on its familiar shape and weight. Looking at his weapon Teraphor thinks to himself, **There is no emotion, there is peace.**  After a few moments he speaks:
"I hear the Mandalorians are fierce warriors. Have any of you encountered them before? "

"I have never faced them myself but if thier history is any clue in what we face we are in for a fight for our lives and the lives of those we protect."

Fretter looks around for others to respond and when no one else seems to do so, he leans forward and speaks up **I have faced them in combat before. They are indeed fierce and they live up to their reputation in battle. But in reality they are nothing more than dogs to be cut to pieces, they are nothing.**
Fretter leans back once more and folds his arms across his chest. He looks to the others hoping his little speech had given them some sort of hope. For now they are his allies, and he would do his best to try and help them survive should a Mandalorian attack occur.

Jace Pander
Jace was sitting in the back of shuttle alone. His eyes played over the passenger section of the small vessel, sizing up all its occupants. Jace reached down into his long coat and pulled out his datapad. After pressing a few buttons, the image of a Trandoshan appeared on the screen.
**â€œCaptain Hussarâ€** Jace read quietly from the screen.
**â€œI hope the good Captain has Myrkr buttoned up tightlyâ€ he said to himself."** 
Jace looked up to see a few of his fellow passengers congregating in one part of the shuttle. There were four of them to be precise; Two Humans, a Miraluka and a Mon Calamari. They were discussing Myrkr and the Mandalorians. Both were topics which interested Jace and he decided to go over and make some new friends.
Getting up from his seat, Jace strides over to the group. His long dirty white coat floats behind him. Black body armor can be seen underneath and a lightsaber hangs from his right hip. A blaster pistol is strapped to his opposite leg.
Jace nodded once to everyone and raised his shades from his eyes to the top of his head before joining the conversation.
**â€œI have never directly faced the Mandalorian threat personally but I have head stories of their brutality. Although, I hardly believe they should be considered to be â€˜nothingâ€™.â€**
Jace brought his right hand to his right hip, hanging his thumb off of his gun belt, and continued talking while waving his left hand in the air in front of him.
**â€œAs soon as we begin to underestimate the enemy, they will thrust the vibroblade between our ribs and into our heart. If what I hear about the Mandalorians is true, they will not underestimate us. They will fight us tooth and nail without regard for their own safety or the safety of the non-combatants.â€**
Jaceâ€™s attention turns to Fretter.
**â€œBut it seems you are the only one of us who has actually met the enemy on the field of battle, so I guess you would know best, â€¦.â€**
Feeling flabbergasted, Jaceâ€™s mouth hung open and his left hand dropped to his side. Jace was going to refer to the black clad Jedi by name but realized he doesnâ€™t know any of these peopleâ€™s names.
**â€œNow where are my mannersâ€** Jace claims as he switches up his hands. His left hand now hanging off of his gun belt and his right hung by his side.
**â€œMy name is Jace.â€** He extends an open black gloved hand to everyone. **â€œJace Pander. It is a pleasure to meet all of you.â€**
EDIT: I refered to Kinsos' character as Kinsos and not Fretter... whoops <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->P

Fretter grins and takes the offered hand...for some reason he liked this Jace, It might be the combat ready appearance he had or it could be that he had confronted Fretter directly...**Do not get me wrong…these Mandalorians are a force to be reckoned with…I was simply trying to lighten the mood for any who where afraid. Oh and my name is Fretter.** Fretter pulls his hood back revealing his face. He has hair cut very close to his head, and to be honest he is not the best looking human in the galaxy. He leans back once more in his chair. He places his hand on his lightsaber hilt and looks to the others standing about the ship...he decides that if he gets into a fight that he will be looking to team up with Jace, to Fretter he seems to be the most capable fighter here.

Jace Pander
Fretterâ€™s handshake was a vice grip on Jaceâ€™s hand and it caught him by surprise. Jace smiled to hide the pain.
**â€œAfraid?â€** Jace echoed Fretterâ€™s words. **â€œWe are Jedi, my friendâ€¦â€**
Jaceâ€™s smile grew into a large grin as he looked at each of the four people in front of him
**â€œWe are all Jedi, we know no fear!â€**
His black gloved hand balled into a tight fist to emphasize his point.
**â€œHowever, any Mandalorians who are foolish enough to assault Myrkr *will* know fear. They will know fear and defeat.â€**
Jace punches his balled fist into his other open hand.
**â€œTogether, we cannot be defeated.â€**

**Very spirited, friend Jace, spirited indeed. My name is Dreti by the way, and a pleasure to meet you all.**
He stands momentarily to bow to everyone, then repositions himself in his seat.
**"Might I make note that while it is important to pay attention to the Mandalorians, they will not be our only source of troubles on Myrkr. Please do not mistake what I say, the Mandalorians are a central focus for us, but let us also not forget our surroundings."**
He seems to sit back, and relax his head against the chair he is in. Closing his eyes momentarily, he waggles his barbels again, and once again rotates each eye stalk independently around the room.
**"If I remember correctly, Myrkr is the single planet in the system of the same name with two creatures of note on it. One being the Vonskr and the other the Ysalamiri. I believe that these two are where the philosophy behind the lightsaber forms Makashi and Juyo come from. The Ysalamiri are apparently non-aggressive creatures, whose most remarkable ability is that they surround themselves with a bubble in which the Force cannot be touched. The Vonskrs are fierce canine predators, who hunt and track apparently by Force sensitivity. Their primary prey being the Ysalamiri. I think that on this mission, the Mandalorians will not be our only opponents."**
He pauses for another moment, before continuing.
**"I seem to remember also that there is mainly just a small republic colony focused primarily on mining the minerals and metals found in the nearby woods. I wish I had time to pull up more recent or relevant data before I had left the Hospital, but these small morsels are what I remember from the Archives."**
He looks about the shuttle one more time, and clears his throat once again.
**"I apologize for my extended speech, but I also seem to remember seeing all of you at one point or another though I must admit that I am absolutely horrible with names. Yes we have Jace here, and I have introduced myself, but due to the apparent mission before us could we not spare a moment and have introductions all the way around?"**

He offers his hand
"Greetings my name is Lor and despite my companions blustering we are not Jedi yet. We are still only padawans."
He looks in the direction of Jace.
"Fear and anger will lead you down the dark path Padawan Pander. We risk much by even going against the council on this matter, do not make it worse by justifying their lack of action on this."

Listening intently to everything Dreti had to say about Myrkr, Jace tried to retain all of the important information.
**â€œI am glad you are here with us Dreti. I know very little about Myrkr, let alone the details of its flora and fauna.
â€œI am sure you will have ample time to dig through the computer files at the Republic colony for more information. Captain Hussar may even have a data file ready for us with everything we need to know about the planet.â€**
Turning to address Lor, Jace takes his hand with a smile. Lorâ€™s slight scolding did not bother Jace much.
**â€œYou are right, Lorâ€** Jace agreed. **â€œFear and anger do lead to the dark side which is why we must not have either.
â€œAnd we are Padawans, not Jediâ€** Jace said humbly, **â€œYou are right again. But something tells me we will face obstacles more difficult and rigorous here on Myrkr than the Trials could ever offer us.â€**
Jace clapped his hand onto Lorâ€™s back.
**â€œWe will be Jedi, my friend, before this nasty war is over.
â€œAs for defying the Council, wellâ€¦â€** Jaceâ€™s smile faded and he seemed to become a little grim. He backed away from Lor as he continued to speak.
**â€œLor, I am sure you have your reasons for defying the Council, as I have mine. Let us not try to push our beliefs on one another.â€**
A smile slowly appeared back on Jaceâ€™s face and his eyes widened a bit.
**â€œWhat matters is that you are here. You are here to defend the Republic citizens from the enemy and you are doing the right thing. And for that, I thank you.â€**
Jaceâ€™s eyes meet the eyes of his companions. **â€œI want to thank all of you for being here. This was not an easy choice for any of us to make. Let us take solace in the fact that we are doing the right thing.â€**

Lor cocks his head as if listening to something.
"I though all Jedi believed that the darkside was to be avoided. We all made our choice to be here despite the councils wishes. All I am saying is we need to tread carefully lest we fall and all our work will be undone."

Your discussions are interrupted by the pilots voice.
"Excuse me, but we have an incoming transmission, it is Hussar, captain of the outpost defenses"
It takes a few moments, then the transmission is patched through to a wall panel in the main passenger area. The image is slightly distorted by static, but in a couple of seconds, you can clearly see the captain on the wiewscreen. A well-built trandoshan, who has the bearing of a veteran soldier, most notably you can see that he has a cybernetic eye.
"Greetingss, jedi. We are pleassed to have you here. I have urgent news for you. Word just reached uss that mandalorian forcess has been tracked entering hyperspace on a vector that sshould take them into the Myrkr sysstem in no more than a day. I would like you to attend to a breiefing for our forcess as ssoon as you landss"
The trandoshan offes a military salute, and then the transmission closes.

Jace turned to the wall panel as the cyborged Trandoshan offered the invitation to the briefing.
When Captain Hussar finished speaking, Jace lifted a raised finger and took a breath as if he was going to say something. Before the words could spill out, Captain Hussar saluted and cut the transmission. Jace, dropped his hand and let the air in his lungs out in a sigh.
**â€œSo much for thatâ€** Jace mumbled.
**â€œWell,â€** Jace said as he started to walk over to a viewport on the side of the shuttle, **â€œIt seems our part in this war is coming a little sooner than anticipated.â€**
Jace put his nose right up against the transparasteel and gazed out into the darkness. It was as if he was expecting the fleet of Mandalorian ships to drop out of hyperspace at any moment and he wanted to be the first to spot the enemy.
Slowly, Jace turned his head towards his companions.
**â€œI sure hope the deck officer, or whoever greets us when we land, knows where this briefing is. The good Captain didnâ€™t tell us.â€**

After listening to the transmission, Teraphor stands up and says **"I would assume that the good captain would not be so foolish as to allow us to miss the briefing."**  Afterwards he turns to face the group and says **"My name is Teraphor, Padawan to Jedi Knight Morrbo Junto. My apologies for being so quiet, but in the absence of something helpful I thought it best to remain silent."**
He sits down again, replacing his lightsaber on his belt. As he sits down he looks around the shuttle for a computer terminal of some sort.
(Search for computer terminal Perception +7)
As he looks around the shuttle, Teraphor asks the pilot in Durese **"How long until we reach our destination?"**

**"Padawan Teraphor, your wisdom gives you and Jedi Knight Morrbo Junto great credit. I appreciate your example, and shall seek to emulate it whenever possible."**
He pauses for a moment as Padawan Lor walks by him as he returns to his seat. His left eyestalk follows Lor, and he nods in agreement with his actions.
Dreti leans back, waggles his barbels once again, and closes both eyes in meditation.
*There is no emotion, there is peace….*

In a shortl while, your shuttle begins its descent on Myrkr. When landed, you are met by a younger officer who escorts you to a briefing room. As you enter the room, you see a group of humans, a duros, and a couple of trandoshans. At the center of attention, located around a holographic projection, stand captain Hussar.
"You are finally here. Good. Pleasse, take a seat. We were just rewiewing the defensess of this outposst"
He points at the projection as he speaks.
"We are ssurounded by a heavy wall of ferracrete, and we have a few turretss mounted atop the wallss, but other than that, we are pretty much left with the individual soldierss sskillss"

As the shuttle descends, Jace returns to his seat and buckles in.
After being escorted to the briefing room, Jace nods to everyone in attendance and greets Captain Hussar.
As the briefing went on, Jace soaked up the images on the holo-projector and the information the Captain provided.
Jace waited for breaks in the Captainâ€™s briefing to ask questions.
**â€œThose turrets, are they primarily for ground defense or anti-air use? Or do they have the power to reach ships in orbit?
â€œAlso, how many soldiers do we have to defend the colony with?â€**

Teraphor follows the others and listens to Captain Hussar's briefing. After Jace asks his questions, Teraphor speaks up.
**"Captain, what about the civilian colonists? Is there any way to evacuate them should the need arise?
"**

## Re: Chapter One: Old flames sparks anew

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-06-16 09:51:02)

The captain looks at Jace and shakes his head.
"This iss a mining colony, not a military outpost. The turretss are low powered laserss, used for ground combat only. Their main use hass been to make wild beastss that wander to close back off"
He sweeps his hand across the room.
"These are the officerss of the militia. A rough esstimate would be that we have about three soldierss for every one of them. Again, we are a mining colony"
He then looks over at Teraphor, and his eyes shows a hint of concern.
"We have transportss that sshould be able to hold everyone in the colony if we packss them really tight. My concernss is that the Mandalorianss will not dissmiss transportss and let them leave peacefully. It will most likely be closse"

## Re: Chapter One: Old flames sparks anew

### **Frost** (2008-06-16 11:43:26)

Lor listens quietly to the discussion. He finally decides to speak.
"We should try to negotiate a peaceful resolution to this."
He waits for the yelling and the laughing to start. He knew they probably wouldn't negotiate but he had to at least suggest it.

Fretter has remained quite through all of this but finally decides to speak up..
**The colonists must be evacuated but I agree the Mandalorians won't let them go, is there anywhere on this planet that they could seek shelter in while the fighting happens.**
Fretter then looks to the officers
**How many of you have actually seen combat with the Mandalorians?**

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-17 10:49:22)

Jace listened intently to his companions questions.
All made good points and he could see they were willing to give their all to protect the colonists. He was happy to be here with this group of Jedi.
**â€œComing to a peaceful resolution would be idealâ€** Jace agreed with Lor. **â€œHowever, from what Iâ€™ve heard of the Mandalorians, something tells me they do not feel the same way. We may not be the ones to throw the first punch in this fight but we will the ones to throw the last.â€** 
Jace turned back to the Captain.
**â€œCaptain, if we do decide to evacuate the colonists on the transports, do we have any starfighters to escort them? The Mandalorians may try to stop them but if we could keep their attention on us for a bit, we may be able to give the transports a big enough window to make the jump into hyperspace.â€**

Leaning forward in his chair, Dreti looks over to the holographic projection of the outpost and surrounding area.
**"Captain Hussar, as an adjunct to my associates question, I remember reading about the presence of minerals and metals in the forrests surrounding us and there capability to sometimes confound readings from sensors and other surveillance equipment. Is this interferance sufficient enough to obfuscate a transport? My thinking is that perhaps we can hide a few ships long enough for the Mandalorian forces to commit a large portion to a ground or close air support battle, and the others can slip away as has been mentioned. Perhaps from the other side of the planet?"**
Dreti then looks over to Captain Hussar.
**"I also must admit that I am not as familiar with the Mandalorian culture as I would want to be, especially in this situation. As a warrior culture, do they take honor from the slaughter of non-combatants? If so, do you know of any ruins or bunkers that we could hide said non-combatants in to protect them, assuming that our initial idea of escape for them does not work? I am wondering if it would be possible to evacuate everyone who is not going to be engaged in the fighting to reduce any collateral casualties and to spare as much life as we can?"**
Dreti places his hands on his knees and leans back slightly so that he can get a better look around him at some of the various other soldiers milling about in the room.
**"Also, as I am a trained in medicine, what is the status of your medical response capabilities? Do you have any medical needs that perhaps I could assist with prior to the Mandalorian forces arrival?"**

The captain watches you with a skeptical look on his face.
"While I ssalute your ssearch for a peaceful ssolution, I have to say that the Mandalorians are not likely to accept that. They tend to think only after thay have conquered"
He takes a short pause, apparently thinking of something.
"The heavy concentration of mineralss here on Myrkr is indeed capable of wreaking havok on ssensorss from time to time. While it might be posssible to hide a transport in the forestss, the forests are dangerouss, and more importantly, the Mandalorianss are likely to send troops into the jungles quickly, if only to prove themselvess against the predatorss that lives here. We could try to hide them in the mining complexess though. Sensorss will probably not be disturbed there, but a powered-down transport could likely hide there, and we would probably ssee less activity from both Mandalorianss and beastss there"
He turns to Jace, with a concerened look on his face.
"We have a few capable starfighterss, but unfortinately there are few experienced pilotss among uss, liuetenant Corr here leads a ssingle squadron of 12 fighterss"
He points over at the duros.
"But Mandalorianss are fierce pilotss, and I would rather not send my men head-to-head with them in sspace combat unless I really have to. Of coursse, if any of you possessess that kind of skillss, your help would be appreciated"
He is interrupted by a call on his comlink, and as he answers it, you can see his face growing more and more intense. As he closes down the call, he turns to you.
"We have received reportss from our outer scouts that the Mandalorianss have entered the system. They will have arrived in a few hourss"

Jace fidgets with his gloved hands while he thinks.
**â€œIf we were to get all the civilians into the hidden transport and ready to go, would there be enough time to power up the ship and evacuate before, and if, the area is overrun by Mandalorians? This way, we can avoid sending the colonists into the awaiting arms of Mando battleships if it isnâ€™t needed.â€**
Jace nods at Lieutenant Corr.
**â€œIf we decide to evacuate the civilians as soon as possible, Iâ€™ll volunteer to aid Lieutenant Corr and his squadron with the escort.
â€œIâ€™ve done my fair share of piloting.â€** Jace says with a slight cocky smile.
**â€œHowever, if we delay the evacuation to see if we can hold off this threat, I would rather be with the ground forces meeting the Mandalorians head on.â€**
Turning to the Duros Lieutenant.
**â€œBy the way Lieutenant, what types of starfighters do we have here?â€**

**I volunteer to lead a ground squadron. Give me 6 other men and a comm link, and I will teach those Mando's to feel fear.**
Fretter rests his hand on the hilt of his lightsaber and shuffles his robes around himself. He then looks to the rest of the Jedi...
**I encourage you to come with me, If we are going to beat them we are going to have to do it on the ground. They will be able to outgun us in the air and they will be able to out shoot us in space. They have no mercy for anyone and if we are going to get the civilians out alive I believe we should try and do it in the heat of battle. While we are fighting their main force the shuttles carrying the Civilians can take off on the other side of the planet and slip into hyperspace, hopefully before the Mandalorians in the fight will have a chance to respond.**

"Our men will be doing what they do besst: Defend thiss outpost. But we might be able to sspare a few for you if you wissh to lead them into battle"
He starts giving orders to the officers, and one by one they disappears, haste showing in their steps.
"If you need anything, our suppliess will be avaible to you. They may be ssmall, but they are all we have. Now, if youÂ´ll exusse me"
With that, he salutes you, and leaves in a hurry.

Waggling his barbels as he leans forward, Dreti looks over to Fretters.
**"I hope, good sir, that by your frown, you are not assuming that the rest of us are hesitating. I, myself, feel that your plan has merit. I am not as handy with a lightsaber as some, but I will stand with any who are willing to defend."**
He stands, folding his healer's robes back into place, and clears his throat.
**"I would hope to be able to assist with the evacuation first, however. It is far more important to me that they all get aboard properly. Once that is completed to my satisfaction, I am more than willing to reconnect and assist with the Mandalorians."**

The battle plans were being drawn and Jace needed to place himself into the optimal position to see the mission through to the end.
**â€œWell, gentlemanâ€** Jace rises from his seat and starts to walk around the table **â€œIt seems we have multiple options on the table. Both of which further our aims to complete our mission.â€**
Jace continues to circle the table and holds up one hand.
**â€œOn one hand, we need to meet the Mandalorian threat head on. The best defense is a strong offense, after all. Most of us came to the Outer Rim to do just this.â€**
He held up his other hand.
**â€œOn the other hand, our mission calls for protection of the colonists. If evacuating them on the transports sooner rather than later would accomplish that, then I would like it to happen.â€**
Jace stops circling the table and ends up standing behind the Mon Calamari Jedi. Jaceâ€™s gloved hands grip the back of the Jediâ€™s chair.
**â€œDreti feels he would be more useful aiding the colonists in their evacuation.â€**
He motions towards the other Jedi
**â€œFretter and Lor feel that going on the offensive would be more their style.
â€œAs for myself, though I would like to be on the field of battle next to you Fretter, I feel my skills would be best served aiding in the escort of the transports. I am sure Lieutenant Corrâ€™s pilots are capable but I would feel better knowing I was up there with them."**
Jace began to move away from behind the Mon Calamari.
**â€œThere is no reason we cannot spearhead an offensive against the Mandalorians and evacuate the colonists at the same time. Besides, our assault force may divide the enemyâ€™s attention enough that it may make the evacuation much easier.â€**
Dropping back into his seat, Jace addresses the final Jedi in the room.
**â€œTeraphor, where do you think your abilities would help you serve the colonists best?â€**

While still discussing your alternatives, a youg soldier appears, and bids you to come with him to the command center. Once there, you enter into a area full of activity. You are shown to a screen displaying the space territory around the system. On the far edge, you can see several dots moving in towards the planet, blinking hostile red. It wonÂ´t be long before they reach the planet, a couple of hours at max.

Jace stared at the tactical displays in the command center for a long time. He wrung his hands together and let out a sigh as the red blips moved across the screen.
**â€œItâ€™s time to sound the alarm for the evacuationâ€** Jace said somberly.
Jace whirls around to face the officers in the room.
**â€œTell the colonists that we arenâ€™t forcing any of them to leave. However, those who decide to stay will be considered combatants and will be expected to take up arms against the Mandalorians.
â€œAlso, none of the colonists should feel obligated to stay. No one will think any less of them if they decide to evacuate.
â€œThe transport and her escorts will leave as soon as everyone is on board.â€**
Jace turns and walks over to a technician sitting at a computer terminal. He kneels down next to the operator and looks him in the eye.
**â€œWhat is your name, soldier? My name is Jace Panderâ€** Jace shakes the technicians hand.
**â€œI need you to do me favor. Can you plot a few hyperspace jumps out of this system and get them to the transport? Weâ€™ll save a lot of time if we have a pre-plotted course and the less time we are stuck here the greater the odds of the transport making it out of here unscathed.
â€œAnd be ready to delete all digital records and information in case the command center is overrun. I donâ€™t mean to demean our abilities but it is always better to be safe than sorry.
â€œThank you, soldier.â€**
Jace gets up off the floor and straightens his coat, brushing a bit of dirt off. He strides up to his fellow Jedi.
**â€œI will link up with you to put more pressure on the enemy once the transport is away.â€**
Jace throws up a mock salute and quickly drops it.
**â€œMay the Force be with youâ€**

Said and done, Jace stays behind with the militia to secure the escape of the transports. The remaining group is given the coordinates of an approximated landing spot for a few enemy ships, and you are taken out there by an airspeeder that then returns to base.
Making your way through the Myrkr forest, you soon reach the area, a small clearing in the forests, located near a small lake. You can spot no enemies, but it does indeed seem like a good spot to land in.
==========================================================
Meanwhile, Jace is doing his best to help with the loading of the transports and the evacuation of the colonists. Several colonists have volunteered to help the militia fight, but there are still a lot that needs evacuation. As they are being loaded onto the transports, you can suddenly hear the sounds of sublight enginges, and seconds later, two ships roars by overhead.

Footsteps reverberated throughout the corridors of the Republic transport. The large ship was buzzing with colonists bringing supplies aboard the ship.
Jace was carrying a large crate of foodstuffs. As he walked into the main hold, he was nearly bowled over by a pair of children running around forcing Jace to spin to avoid them. Jace just smiled and shook his head, he was happy that the kids could still retain their innocence in a time of such strife. Putting the crate down next to ones just like it, Jace removed his shades and wiped some sweat from his brow.
Jace, hopping on top of one of the crates, decided to take a break. He was talking and laughing with a few of the workers. One of the older colonists had a few rather amusing jokes about Mandalorians walking into a cantina.
Then the roar of starship engines was heard. Jaceâ€™s eyes widened with shock and he hopped off the crate. Jace and the colonists ran out of the main hold and headed towards the exit ramp. Outside, colonists could be seen looking up into the sky and Jace feared the worst.
Throwing his shades on to protect his eyes from the sunâ€™s glare, Jace ran outside just in time to see it. A pair of starships streaked over head. Jace couldnâ€™t identify the ships and he cursed under his breath.
The colonists began to stir and panic. Jace attempted to alleviate their fears by assuring them the situation was under control and that the Captain of the transport would give the order to leave soon. He also suggested getting back to loading the ship up since they would only have the supplies they bring with them once they evacuate.
Turning back to the Transport, Jace ran to go find the shipâ€™s Captain. They needed to take off as soon as possible.

As you are dropped of into the forest, you makes your best to make yourselves as invisible as possible. Lor reaches out with the Force in an attempt to find his opponents, but he cannot make out them among all the other beings. He can sense the forest very much alive and filled with beings, and every here and there he recognizes a prescense that flares a little brighter than the others. Fretter notices a small rubble of stones at the edge of the clearing, with a small path leading into the forest between it and the water, maybe 5 meters wide. Seemingly a good spot for an ambush.
=========================================
With the roaring of engines heard above their heads, the hearts of the colonists are filled with fear. The militia and Jace does their best to calm them down. As usual in a situation of panic, getting people to behave in a clam and controlled manner is difficult to say the least. While the colonists are still getting on the transports, you can hear more engine roars, and the ships soar over your heads a couple of more times, the last time with an addition of two more ships.

Jace was helping the Transport crew gather colonists into the ship. As scared civilians filed into what either was going to be their savior or their coffin, a loud rumble brought everyoneâ€™s attention skyward. More starships streaked overhead.
Jace locked eyes with one of the crewmen.
**â€œLook, I need to get to my starfighter. Finish getting everyone on board and I will let you know as soon as the coast is clear for you to take offâ€**
The two of them shook hands tightly.
**â€œI will see you at the rendezvous point when everything cools off here.â€** Jace reassured the crewman.
Jace spins and heads off towards the starfighter platform and looks for Lieutenant Corr.
**â€œTime to find out what we have to throw up against these Mandos.â€**

While none of you can see a trace of any enemies, you takes up a position hidden among the rocks and bides your time. In the distance, you can hear the soaring of starship engines. As you wait for a matter of minutes, you can see a large, bulky ship head your way and settle down into the clearing. The ship resembles a flying box, and as it settles down on four extended landing legs, Mandalorian warriors begins to pour through an opened hatch in the side. With military efficiency, they quickly deploys and starts to unload gear. As you quietly observes them, you can count to at least two dozen warriors.
==================================================
Jace manages to get a hold of Lt. Corr, and to no suprise, he finds the duros in full way of giving his pilots their instructions. As Jace approaches, he turns around and greets him with a quick nod.
"We were just going through the details regarding this fight. I donÂ´t want anyone trying to be ahero, ok? Our objective is to see the transports safely away, before we starts our own retreat. We will be sending the ships in waves of two, using our full fighter force to cover each group. We will leave a single transport behind that we can use to evacuate all remaining ground personel. Do you have anything to add, or do you wish me to show you to your fighter?"

## Re: Chapter One: Old flames sparks anew

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-04 15:09:00)

Jace approached Lt Corr and his pilots and returned the Duroâ€™s nod. Corr was briefing his pilots and Jace listened intently.
The men all looked like competent pilots and he was confident about this mission. When Corr was finished talking, he asked Jace if he had any input. He did.
**â€œWhat if we keep a few starfighters in reserve to defend the take off pointâ€** Jace suggested.
**â€œI mean, once the first transport takes off, the Mandalorians are sure to see it and know where our landing pad is. On the ground, these transports will be sitting ducks.â€**
Jace let that suggestion sink in before going on.
**â€œAlso, Lieutenant, I know your pilots are important to you and I know you want them to rendezvous with the transports as soon as they are all away but I have a request.
â€œI am not planning on leaving Myrkr as soon as this mission is over. We all have friends fighting here on the ground and I believe we can tip the scales in their favor if we can assist them with a little air power.â€**
Jace turned to the group of pilots
 **â€œI want to ask for volunteers to help me defend our friends and your home.â€**
Jace wasnâ€™t sure if Lt Corr would appreciate using his menâ€™s loyalty to the colony to keep them around and risk their lives but he knew that keeping the fighters in the battle would only improve their odds of victory. If they couldnâ€™t directly apply pressure to the Mandalorian ground forces, then they could at least keep the enemyâ€™s starfighters off of the colonists.
Jace only hoped Lt Corr saw it the same way he did.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-08-09 06:19:28)

As Fretter takes a closer look, he can see that thet appears to be unloading pretty standard gear for a field command post: communications equipment, sensory arrays and a few repeating blasters.
============================================
Corr listens to what Jace says, and you cannot help but notice a slight twitch in his eyebrows at the mention of staying around to fight once the transports are away.
"Ok Jedi, weÂ´ll do it your way. I will take six of my men to see the transports away, and you can lead the remaining six here. I will bring them around to the far side of the planet before hitting orbit. That way we should have a chance of evading the Mandalorian forces"
He takes a look over at his pilots.
"Any of you who wishes to stay behind to help fight the enemy may do so. Just remember that you only have one life. DonÂ´t waste it. Now, get those fighter up and ready to go!"
The pilots scatter, scrambling for their fighters, and Corr turns back to Jace.
"Follow me, IÂ´ll show you your ship"
He shows you to the hangar, where the shipÂ´s garrison of fighters is located. You recognizes the pilots readying Aurek Fighters for combat, and Corr shows you to the back of the hangrar where two Republic Assault Fighters are located.

Jace was grateful that Lt. Corr was allowing his pilots the choice to join in the defense of their colony. Hopefully, some would actually take the opportunity to do so. Afterall, Jace couldnâ€™t force them.
The Jedi followed closely behind the Duros Lieutenant as he was led through the hanger. Jace examined the Aurek fighters lined on both sides of the hanger bay. Maintenance crews buzzed around the fighters as they were doing their last minute checks.
Lt. Corr stopped near the back of the hanger. In front of the two of them was a pair of Republic Assault Fighters.
**â€œAre one of those for me?â€** Jace said with a grin steadily growing on his face.

Jace was as giddy as a school girl but, of course, he couldnâ€™t show it. His excitement merely came out in the form of a wide goofy smile.
Quickly, he climbed into the seat and the flight crew removed the boarding ladder from the side of the fighter. As the canopy closed around the Jedi, he put on the communications headset and powered the starfighter up. Jace wasnâ€™t very familiar with the controls of the Republic ship but he managed to figure them out.
He began to go through the pre-flight check list:
-Engines: Green
-Shields: Green
-Weapons: Green
-Sensors: Green
-Communications: Yellow
-Life Support: Green
All systems seemed like they were good to go except the communications array. The yellow light indicated there was something wrong. Jace wasnâ€™t sure if he should alert the crew chief of the problem in fear of not being able to fly. On the other hand, without the ability to communicate with the rest of the squadron, he would be nothing but a liability. Nervously, he tapped on the screen. The status changed after a few seconds.
- Communications: Green
Jace was pleasently surprised.
*'Whew, that was close'* Jace thought to himself. He hoped no one had tried to contact him while his radio was down.
**â€œThis is Alpha-Two. I am showing green across the board. I await authorization to lift off.â€** Jace called over the comm. He was anxious to get into the air and mix it up with the Mando invaders.
His black gloved hands cracked knuckles as he waited for the OK to take off.

## Re: Chapter One: Old flames sparks anew

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-15 13:05:42)

There was no response to Jaceâ€™s call. He became a little worried and as he was about to key the comm again, a high pitched noise could be heard from inside the body of the fighter. Soon after, there was an audible POP! Smoke started pouring out from behind a panel on the starfighter and the status indicator changed again:
Communications: **RED**
*At least now I know why no one is responding to me*, Jace thought to himself.
Within a blink of an eye, maintenance crews were peeling the panel off the ship and pulled out a partially melted communications array.
As the crew began installing a new array, Jace sighed in relief that this faulty equipment was found here on the ground rather than while fighting the enemy.

Ava stood a few meters behind Fretter and Lor, she found herself conflicted as she realized she was woefully unprepared for this fight. A fight she had been eager to join.
The two other Jedi she had followed had barely acknowledged her; it was not only because of her attire befitting more a miner than a Jedi, but she also lack the confidence of those two. Any force user could easily feel she was oozing doubt.
*Pull yourself together Ava.*
She tried to calm herself and nervously brushed aside a lock of brown hair. The possibility of dying here finally dawned on her. Until now, this whole adventure had seemed like an escapade, but now the grim reality sunk in. Yet, she found no regret. She had little to live for, becoming a Jedi was one of the only things that kept her going and that meant she had to prove herself. She would succeed or die.
With newfound resolve Ava pushed aside her doubts and concentrated on the Mandalorians. She unclipped the lightsaber hanging on her belt and her thumb instinctively hovered over the activation.
*I'll show them that I'm as capable as any other trainee.*
She was now eager for the two other Jedi to signal an attack on the Mandalorians.

Quietly, Lorn stepped away from the group. There was no sense in everyone standing so close together if there was going to be a fight.
Lorn unhooked his lightsaber from his belt, holding it gently in his left hand, as if it was an extension of his body. It had to be, according to Master Aric, if the Jedi were to be successful with the weapon.
As he watched the Mandalorians unload their ship, he took a deep breath as he readied himself for whatever would come. This wasn't his first fight, nor would it likely be his last.
He was ready; the Force was with him.

You watch as the Mandalorians unload their ship. A bit astonished by the sheer number of warriors, you still remember that you are jedi, and you have a job to do. As you watch, the Mandalorian warriors begins to establish some sort of field HQ, and a group of four warriors begins to walk along the path that will take them right in front of your hiding place.
As the group passes right before you, the impatient Fretter gives up a high battlecry and leaps forward, swinging his saber at the nearest warrior, decapitating him. Seasoned veterans as they are, the Mandalorians are not late to react, but as they brings their weapons to bear, Teraphor and Dreti joins their friend in the assault.

Lorn stayed focused on the other Mandos, the ones still in the clearing, with the ship. What was Fretter thinking, acting like this? If the others heard the fight, as they were sure to, they'd swarm the area, and the Jedi would have a real fight on their hands.
He had to stop that.
Lorn looked around at the surrounding trees, and a glimmer of an idea formed in his head. Maybe, just maybe, this would work. Lorn flicked on his lightsaber, and the dark blue blade hissed to life.

Fretters sudden and unexpected strike catches the mandalorian completely off guard, and he falls down in a heap while his armored head falls to the side.
The young jedis advantage is short, however, as three of the warriors brings their weapons to bear against him. A hail of concentrated blasterfire covers the padawan, but his blade moves with the speed of light, scattering the oncoming assault wide.
Leaving his hiding place, Lor assumes a defensive stance atop one of the rocks, igniting his lightsaber. He reaches out with his hand, and one of the mandalorians flinches a bit as his rifles leaves his hand, and Lor catches it one-handed.
Taking advantage of the distraction, Teraprhor makes a leap down from the rock, and takes out the warrior in a single swipe of his blade.
The last of the warriors fires away at Teraphor, his shots digging into the stones behind the jedi.
Lorn was quite shcoked when Fretter attacked, and his concern goes towards the mandalorians still at the ship. As he casts a quick glance, he can see five more armored warriors running towards them, while yet more starts to mount a pair of heavy blasters. Determined to stop them, he activates his lightsaber and swings it a a nearby tree, digging deep into the trunk.
Spurred by the thrill of battle, Fretter emerges from the heavy assault, battlelust shining in his eyes. In an instant, he leaps towards the closest soldier, and in a spinning frenzy hacks the warrior to pieces.
Leaping from the rock, Ava launches a powerful blow against one of the warriors. The warrior staggers as he is hit by the heavy impact of the blade, his armor barely holding the deadly blade of his body.
Coming up behind the others, Dreti reaches out with the Force, and hurls one of the smaller boulders against the opponents. The battle seems to have gotten to his nerves though, and the boulder only shakes a bit, but remains on the ground.
You can all hear sounds from the landing craft, and you supposes that company will be arriving soon.
((MoDaVader, the tress can indeed be used to throw if you wants to. Yet if you want something that will have some effect, youÂ´d have to aim for a larger one, which isnÂ´t just cut down like that, and it might also require quite a bit. There are of course smaller ones as well, but they might not have any real effect. Also, the landing craft is well out of your reach to throw them))

Lorn kept his eyes on the approaching Mandos as he cut through the tree. If he timed it just right, he could knock it over on them as they ran past. Briefly, he considered throwing them with the Force, but tossed that idea aside. His skill with telekinesis was weak, at best. He'd never get an entire tree into the air. He'd settle for simply toppling it. In the end, the effect would be the same.

Seemingly unaffected by the rapid loss of his comrades, one of the remaining mandalorian warriors turns his rifle upon the agressive Fretter and unloads. The jedi barely manages to parry away the blaster bolts, but his rapid advance is stopped.
Lor lets the weapon fall to the ground beside him, and reaches out with a Force impulse to disable the warrior. The warrior seems to take a few staggering steps, but appears to shrug off the effect.
Teraphor swings at the first warrior, but his lighsaber just glances of the warriors armor as he sidesteps the attack.
Aiding his companion, the last remaining warrior fires at Fretter as well, but the jedi has already found a defensive stance and can safely deflect the bolts.
Alerted by the approaching reinforcements, Lorn took another swipe at the tree, nearly severing it, and readied to hurl it at the soldiers.
Only more enraged by the barrage of blasterfire coming at him, Fretter begins his charge even as the bolts flies, but the reckless attack is easily avoided by the enemy.
Continuing her momentum, Ava spins her saber in a wild circle, but the mandalorian manages to dive out of harmÂ´s way.
Dreti, a healer by nature, would very well like to help Fretter, as the other is being relentlessly mowed down by blasterfire. But going down there would accomplish nothing. Remaining behind with Lorn, he instead reaches out with his mind, trying to reach the other, but FretterÂ´s mind is too clouded in emotions to be reachable.
The charging warriors halts at about 30 meters distance, and raises their rifles, taking careful aim.

Dodging Fretters vicious attack, the mandalorian warrior swing his rifle to bear, catching the jedi in the side, his lightsaber unable to deflect the attack.
Lor drops down from the rock to present himself as a lesser target. Seeking calm in the middle of the battle, he allows the Force to flow freely though him, dampening his sensations of pain, steeling him. *(Lor gains DR5. Remember that you have to spend a Move Action and 1 Force Strength at the beginning of your next turn if you wish to maintain it)*
As the warrior sidesteps Fretters attack and retaliates at the young jedi, he comes right in line for Teraphors blade. With a single swift cut, he decapitates the warrior.
With his friends gone, the last mandalorian warrior decides to retreat. Turning his weapon towards the two jedi near his fallen comrade, he pour blasterfire against them, then turns around to run, barely dodging AvaÂ´s lightsaber as he passes her. The shots goes wide, leaving the jedi unharmed.
With a final blow, Lorn breaks through the trunk of the tree, causing it to start tipping.
Catching his breath from the being struck by the bolt, Fretter hurls his lightsaber in a vicious final strike against the fleeing warrior. The blade pierces the soldier back and impales him. Fretter reaches for his saber, but his strength fails him, and he is left weaponless.
With the last of the warriors down, Ava turns into a new stance, facing the onrushing mandalorian reinforcements.
Hearing LornÂ´s call, but unable to bear the sight of his friend so badly hurt Dreti runs to Fretter, reaching out to his wounded friend, trying to stop the bleeding and suffering from the wound he took.
The lined up warriors opens fire, and the hail of blaster bolts digs into Teraphor, Dreti and the already worn out Fretter, felling the warriors one by one.
((Just to remind everyone when calculating your Force Strength (you donÂ´t have to, I can post a summary of everyones Strength at the end of each round if youÂ´d like) you have to pay 1 FS at the ends of every round in which you made a Force skill check. This means that your character only has 1 FS left Frost. Also, if you uses a Force Power with set DCs and different FS costs for each DC, you can specify which DC you are going for, otherwise IÂ´ll just head for the highest available. This would be if you go for a lower one to save FS for instance))

Watching the jedi fall so easily, the warriors seems bent on showing no remorse. Almost as a single entity, the warriors adjust their aims and sends a volley of bolts against Lor and Ava, forcing the two jedi to go on the defensive, not to be overwhelmed by the heavy fire. One of the bolts graces AvaÂ´s shoulder, and tears her flesh in a small burn wound.*(Lor takes 10 dmg and Ava takes 16 dmg. Ava moves to -1 at the CT)*
With the Force shielding him from some of the pain and ache from deflecting the blaster bolts, Lor finds himself pressed backwards, and he leaps behind one of the larger boulders taking cover from the attack.
As the tree starts to fall, Lorn tries to catch it in his mental grip, but he canÂ´t seem to get a hold of it. It feels too big, and he cannot hold it as it falls to the ground.
Feeling the sting from the blaster bolt, Ava bites together. Assuming a defensive stance, she backs towards the others, still facing the enemy.
*Force Strength Summary*
*Lorn: 7/7 - DidnÂ´t loose any since the tree is larger than medium, and thus you couldnÂ´t attempt the check without speding a Force Point to increase the size, and you didnÂ´t say you wanted to do that, so I wonÂ´t take a Force Point from you just like that.
Lor 0/9 - Will be unable to maintain Force Protection on his next turn.

As their targets vanishes, the soldiers starts to advance forward, rifles held at the ready. They never saw it coming.
From behind one of the boulders, Lor steps forward, hands raised. Screaming at the troopers in rage, he draws the Force to him, sends it flowing through him, even as he can feel it draining his strength away. His companions can both feel the darkness and power emanating from the miraluka. The giant tree in front of Lorn raises from the ground, and flies towards the shocked warriors, and crushes them all in a single blow. Staggering from the surge of power just passing through his body, Lor can barely stand up. *(Lor moves to -5 at the CT, spends 1 FP and 1 DP, and increases his DSS by 2)*

He opened his mind to the Force looking to it for guidance, and trying to put Lor's actions out of his mind for the moment.

Running up to her friend, Ava checks him, trying to see if he was okay. In fact, she as well was happy for the respite, taking a moment to gather herself. *(Ava requires 1 more Swift Action to complete the recover action)*
Shocked by the others amazing display of power, Lorn turns his attention towards the manalorians remaining at their transport. There was some fervent activity there, and although he couldnÂ´t see clearly all details, he suspected it sould only be a matter of seconds before they would send more warriors against the tired and hardly pressed jedi. Seeking guidance in the Force, he found himself blinded, the darkness he had felt mere moments ago still lingering in his mind. *(Lorn expends 1 FS)*

Lorn looked from the fallen Padawans to the incoming Mandos, then back again. Fretter, Teraphor, Dreti . . . they'd died doing their duty. And Lor and Ava just wanted to give it up. Run away. Retreat. Battles were not supposed to be fought like that.
Yet Lorn didn't want to face the Mandos alone. It had taken less than six to cut down the three Padawans. He wouldn't stand a chance.
Backup wasn't coming -- there was too much interference. Retreat was their only option. Reluctantly, he followed Lor into the forest.

He is recovering, but can still feel the effects of the Force rushing though him. The warriors are still coming towards you. In the distance, you can hear the sounds of more ships approaching, and as you look up, you spots two landing craft coming in for the same area as the first.

Lor closes his eyes for a moment, reaching out to the Force for answers. He can feel a hunger in the jungles, one that is different from the mandalorian warriors, more...primal. While going back to the mandalorian ship will surely be dangerous, he feels that the least amount of danger lies that way.

Time seemed to stand still as the technicians replaced the faulty communications array of the starfighter.
Jace drummed his fingers on his console while he waited. He realized that his impatience wasnâ€™t making the crew work any faster so he decided to try and calm himself. He closed his eyes and drew a long breath in through his nose in an attempt to focus himself.
He hoped his comrades were faring better than he was so far.
The Jediâ€™s meditation was interrupted by a loud sound. Opening his eyes, Jace saw the crew chief knocking on the canopy and giving the "thumbs upâ€ sign. Apparently the starfighter had been repaired.

Jaceâ€™s hand gripped the controls and he guided his starfighter out of the hanger and into formation with the rest of his squadron.

Jace and Alpha squadron were circling the area for far too long. Why hadnâ€™t the Mandalorians attacked yet? Or at least made a sensor sweep or a recon fly-by. Perhaps the enemy didnâ€™t deem them a threat. Or maybe the enemy didnâ€™t see them at all.
Regardless of the reason, Jace was certain that now was the time to act. He keyed the comm.
**"Alpha-two to Control. We have clear skies. Repeat: Clear Skies. Please send up the first transport."**
Jace hoped he hadnâ€™t spoken too soon.

The three Jedi advances forward cautiously, their sabers raised in a tight defense. Another bolt streaks forward, close to AvaÂ´s head, and a second flashes of LorÂ´s saber. Suddenly, Lorn spots something red moving in the jungles, just about 20 meters ahead of him.
((Lorn spent 1 Force Strength))
============================================
After a while an acknowledge comes from Control to JaceÂ´s fighter.
"Roger that Alpha. We will be releasing the first transport shortly"
Scanning around himself, Jace keeps his eyes open for enemy fighters, and soon he spots a trio of unidentified craft in the distance. Scannners identifies them as mandalorian fighters. He can hear CorrÂ´s voice over the comm.
"Alpha Three to Eight, follow me. We will now fly under designation Beta Squadron, and our primary objective is to see the transports safely away. Alpha Nine to Fourteen, Alpha Two will take over the role as Alpha leader. Your role will be to draw the enemy away so that we may slip out as smoothly as possible"
There is a slight pause on the comm as all pilot clicks in their acknowledgements. Then Corr speaks again.
"I am counting on seeing you all again once we make it out of here. May the Force be with you all"
((Judging from the stats I made up, the CEC Shela-class Fighter on pg 181 of the KOTOR guide pretty well matches the fighters I had in mind for you (even better because of the fudging with stats in the official books : ), so thatÂ´s what IÂ´ll use))

The three blips appeared on Jaceâ€™s sensors without warning: Mando starfighters!

**â€œAlpha Nine through Twelve, lets go say hi. Thirteen and Fourteen, stay in reserve in case the enemy gets away from us.â€**
Jace waited for confirmation before peeling off towards the enemy.
**â€œRemember what Lt Cor saidâ€¦ we are all going to make it through this.â€**
Once in formation with his wingmen, Jace lines up the lead enemy fighter in his crosshairs before hailing the enemy fighters.
**â€œMandolorian Starfighters: This is your one and only chance to turn around and leave. Continuing on your present course will be considered a hostile action and you will be destroyed.â€**

As another bolt is deflected of his saber, Lor picks up his pace, small running towards the point of origin for the last shot. As he gets closer, he spots a mandalorian warrior in red armor moving to his side, just a few meters away from him, his rifle raised. Another shot blazes away, but whistling behind Lor in his run.
Seeing his friend take off so abruptly, Lorn follows pace, spotting the warrior as he moves.
Ava, moving in a different direction, finds the warrior coming straight at her, about 6 meters away.

The Mandalorian Warrior veers to the side as Ava steps out in front of him, staggers forward as LorÂ´s blow graces the back of his armor, and is finally put down as LornÂ´s saber severs his head from his shoulders. For a moment, the jungle falls quiet, and neither of the three padawans can sense any more opponents. *All Force Strength has been restored*
===============================================
The Mandalorian fighter splits up, and your pilots veers off in pairs to engage them. The lead fighter keeps its course straight at Jace. Its cannons blazes at his ship, but the shields holds. *Jaces fighter has lost 5 SR*
As they streaks towards each other, the three Republic fighters opens fire on the enemy ship, and soaks its hull in laserfire, causing a small explosion in the side of the ship. The enemy has suffered heavy damage, but still appears to be intact.
Jace has lost sight of the rest of his squad in the heat of the battle, but in the Force he can still feel them all.

Lorn lowers his sabers, and deactivates it.  As the blade vanishes, he turned away, frowning beneath his breath mask.  This was his first kill, and he felt oddly quiet inside.

Ava does likewise with her blade before clipping it to her belt. Shrugging at his question, she stared at the dead mandalorian, feeling the reality of it even more keenly then when she was injured.
"We might as well..." She replied in a hushed voice, trailing off into uncertainty.

The space battle goes well, and the pilots takes the Mandalorian fighters down with haste. Over the comm line, CorrÂ´s voice is heard.
"Alpha Leader, this is Beta. The first transport has entered hyperspace safely, but IÂ´ve received words from base. Mandalorian forces have landed near the base, and are approaching as we speak. Still no contact with the strike team"
There is a brief pause, and you can hear a warning beep from your fighters, and then Corr speaks again.
"We have additional fighters incoming, and in greater numbers this time. I spot 3, no 4 wings (1 wing = 6 fighters) coming in fast. We cannot afford to wait much longer, we must prepare all transports to leave immediately"
In the distance, Jace and Rune can spot several Mandalorian ships approaching.

Blake and Nerrik have been helping out with preparations for evacuation and defense of the base when the alarm is sounded. Mandalorian forces are approaching the base.

Blake was in the middle of moving a peice of equipment from one spot to another when the alarm sounded, he rushed to put the equipment where it needed to go.  *Well you volunteered for this, now it's time to prove your worth in a fight.*  He thought to himself, as he looked around trying to find a good vantage point to intercept any threats that would come into the area he was currently at.  After a few seconds he gave up and unclipped his lightsaber taking it in his hand he held off activating it in an attempt to hide having it out at all.  "Nerrik, you might want to get ready for a poential fight, ifI understand the alarms correctly we've got enemies on the way here."

Ava leads the march back to the Mandalorian ship. While trying to remain detached with a confident demeanour, she cannot help herself from looking nervously left and right.
*What if they are all waiting for us?*
With this thought, her steps become more cautious, hoping perhaps to catch the fearsome warriors by surprise or avoid their attention altogether.

Lorn follows close behind Ava, but doesn't notice her nervousness.  His mind is still preoccupied,    as his thoughts remain on the Mandalorian man he'd just killed.  He still grips his lightsaber tightly in his hands, and his knuckles whiten with the vise-like grip he holds on it.
His hand trembles slightly, but he quickly gets it under control.  He'd known the killing was coming . . . that was unavoidable in war.  He just hadn't been prepared for how it would make him feel.  He didn't like it; he wasn't a killer.  Still, there were going to be more deaths before the day was through.
He picks up his pace and starts a jog back toward the Mando ship.  Killing or no killing, there was no reason to postpone the inevitable.

Letting the Force guide her hands, she turned towards the new flight of Mandie fighters. "Everyone, Engage the fighters, before they can get range on the Transports. Use Torpedoes and Missiles."
Switching over to Proton Torpedoes, Rune locks onto the lead fighter, and fires.

As the alarm sounds, Blake and Derrik drops what they are doing, preparing themselves for combat. A soldier, wearing light armor and a blaster rifle comes running over the landing area where they were working.
"Jedi, captain Hussar would like you to join him in the briefing room. Our sensor have picked up Mandalorian troops moving a few kilometers outside of the base"
=====================================================
Lor, Ava and Lorn creeps cautiously towards the ship. Approaching from another angle, they stop at the edge of the jungle, possibly a hundred meters between them and the ship. From this distance, they cannot make out all the details, but it seems like the Mandalorians have established a command post using the ship as a base. The Mandalorians shows no signs of having spotted them yet.

As Nerriak and Blake enters the briefing room, they joins captain Hussar and the rest of the senior officers of the militia. He waves to the two padawans.
"Ah, welcome Jedi. Now that we are all asssembled, letÂ´ss get to buissness shall we? The ssituation is ssimple. Mandalorian forces have landed and are advancing on our perimeter. We expect them to be here in a couple of hours, maximum. I need you all to prepare the men and get them to their sstations"
He looks at the two padawans.
"Our airforce are holding of the Mandalorianss so far, but we need you to get the transportss loaded as fasst as possible. Corr hasss told me that we must take them out all at once"
Finishing his speech, the Trandoshan picks up a geavy rifle next to him, and clicks its safety.
"LetÂ´ss show them that we donÂ´t go down without a fight. May the Force be with uss"
==================================================================
With Ava and Lor holding back, Lorn creeps closer to the forest edge, trying to get a better wiev of the Mandalorian camp. He can spot a handful of troops, working on radars, communications arrays and other gear typically found in a command center.
==================================================================
Up in the air, the battle rages on. Rune leads her fighters in a head-on assault on the Mandalorian ships, her proton torpedoes cutting through the lead fighter, and her wingmen gunning a second down. As the returned fire raina around her, she adjusts the settings on her shields to increase their power against the heavy barrage.
The battle is not going as well for Jace and his wing. Two of his fighters erupts in a blaze of fire at impact, and while he breaks through the line, he catches two of the enemy fighters on his tail.

At RuneÂ´s command, the fighters with her splits into pairs to engage the enemy individually. However, Mandalorian skill in the cockpit doesnÂ´t seem to be falsely described, and the enemy nimbly dodges their fire, and in a sharp turn followed by a concentrated salvo, she finds one of her fighters reduces to atoms.

Blake and Nerrik moves out, and they starts to pack up the freighters, making the civilians get on board in an orderly fashion, and such things. They are loading up two *Dynamic*-class freighters. As they are loading the ships, they suddenly hear the sound of explosions, and a pile of smoke rises from outside the eastern wall.

Leaving the freighters to get moving, Blake and Nerrik makes their way towards the stairways up to the parapets where the militia men have taken defensive positions and are using the few stationary guns to fire at an enemy the Jedi have yet to see.

Nerrik stumbles to his feet after he was thrown back. Tasting a small bit of blood in his mouth, he starts running him self through one of the Jedi calming techniques he had learned through his studies with the order trying to refocus himself.
He then takes a quick look around to see what type of devastation had occurred to the facility and its defenders, hoping to spot something that may assist the militia in taking down several of the basilisk war droids.
Not sure who he should give commands to Nerrik he speaks in general. **"Assist the seriously wounded and get them further inside, those still able to hold a blaster and not hinder his fellows should stay here with us to deter this assault. We need something big to take down those droids. If we have any heavy weapons and those trained to use them please speak up now."**
With that Nerrik pulled out his commlink and speaks into it briskly, **"Republic defense fighters, this Nerrik of the Jedi Order. I'm transmitting my coordinates, there are 2 basilisk war droids attacking the facility and we could use a bombing run to help even the odds. I Repeat this is Nerrik of the Jedi Order Request Immediate Air Support at specified coordinates."**

Rune takes a deep breath, as she listens to the message. She takes a moment to center herself, as she considers this. Turning her sensors, She tries to get an idea of how the space battle is currently progressing. How many ships has she lost, and how many of the Mando fighters are left.

At her command, Rune can see two of the fighters break formation and soar in the direction of the base. The rest of them are locked in combat with the Mandalorians. Tailing up on a stray wounded fighter, her lasers reduces it to shrapnel.
======================================================
Inside the base, Nerrik and the others watches the Basilisks move closer, and as it gets within range, the militia focuses the fire of its weapon emplacements on one of them. With a shriek, two Aurek fighters swoops in, and as their lasers cannons joins the militiaÂ´s fire, the droid explodes in a smoking ball of fire.
======================================================
Moving out on a small hill, Lor, Lorn and Ava gets a good vantage point of the space around the base. About 1 km away, they watches one of the Basilisk droids get reduced to slag by two incoming fighters.

His saber hissing to life Nerrik motions to the troops.

"Status Report, People." Rune calls over the transmitter, as she tried to get a better idea of how the battle is progressing, And more importantly how many of the Mandalorian fighters remained. She switches back over to the general channel, speaking once more to her opponents. "Is there any of you that can actually provide me with a challenge?"

As if on command, a trio of Mandalorian fighters drops behind Rune, laser cannons blazing towards her, and only through her Force-enhanced reflexes does she manage to throw the ship to the side and out of harmÂ´s way. Her comm crackles to life.
"We are taking heavy losses. Our sensors have picked up several troop ships entering the atmosphere a few clicks east of the base"
Pulling her ship around in a sharp turn, she fires against the trio of fighters, but her shots flies wide.
==============================================================
The remaining Basilisk droid opens fire again, and the concentrated firepower of the war machine proves too much for the wall, and in a huge explosion a large portion of the wall flies apart. Smoke and dust covers the breach for a few moments, and then brilliant red bolts begins to fly through.
==============================================================
Lorn, Ava and Lor continued their march towards the base, keeping a certain distance from the advancing Mandalorian forces, as to not get spotted. Suddenly they see a massive explosion tear away a chunk of the wall, and troopers began to pour through.

As Ava watches the Basilik war droid destroying the compound's walls, she forgets about the stinging pain of her injury and her fatigue. Clutching her lightsaber tightly in her right hand, she turns to her companions and addresses them in a voice that bespeaks urgency.

Lorn can sense Ava's eagerness, and it must be contagious as Lorn starts feeling that way himself. As he considers the situation, he gently tosses his lightsaber from one hand to the other. "I don't think that would be a great idea considering by how much they outnumber us. What if we cause a distraction instead, and get some of their troops to turn our way? We might be able to handle the fight in smaller chunks and prevent some from getting inside the base."

The Republic fighters tries to disengage, but the Mandalorians are too superior, and only a few of them makes it away. Rune releases a proton torpedo against one of them, but the experienced pilot manages to dodge it, but still seems shaken by the blastwave.
As she tries to break for the base, she doesnÂ´t seem able to shake the trio on her tail, and her shields take a pounding from heavy laserfire, rattling her fighter. *15 Hp lost, SR down by 5*
====================================================
Even before the dust settles, Nerrik leads his troops down towards the breach in the wall. A couple of them falls to the blasterfire pouring into the breach. The rest of them manages to take up positions among the larger pieces of rubble, returning fire.
====================================================
As he listens around, Lorn can hear something sounding like footsteps. As they all move to the side and into cover, they spot five soldiers, carrying what appears to be some kind of heavy weaponry. One of the soldiers settles down what he is carrying.

Ava throws herself into a wild charge, breaking out of the bushes, heading for the surprised Mandalorians. She send her lightsaber into a wild swing, powerful enough to decapitate the man, but on pure reflex the soldier dodges out of her way. Regaining his stance he starts to bring his rifle to bear, but is stopped short as Lorn charges past Ava, stabbing his saber deep into the mans chest, instantly killing him.
===============================================
As Nerrik spies out, he can see the bulk of the Mandalorian army outside the walls, The remaining Basilisk standing in the distance. Much closer, he sees a unit of approximately 15 or so warriors run towards the breach in the wall. They seem to be about 50 meters or so away(33 squares). He reaches out with the Force, gripping a nearby boulder to hurl at the approaching enemies, but just as he grabs it, something explodes nearby, causing a momentary loss in his concentration, making him loose the boulder.

Relentless in his attack, Lorn retracts his lightsaber from the soldier he stabbed, bringing it into an overhead swing against the closest soldier, letting the Force guide his strike. His strike nearly hits home, but the soldier shifts to the side in the final movement, and the energy blade scores a smoking hit on the shoulder of his armor, but apparently leaving the soldier unharmed.
Reeling back from the attack, the soldier regains his wits, and fires his rifle at almost point blank range at Lorn. Saber low from the attack, the young padawan barely can bring it up in time to deflect the bolt from hitting him square in the chest. Instead is scorches him in the side, tearing through his robes and digging deep into his flesh. *Lorn takes 26 points of damage and moves -1 on the CT*
Spreading out into a semi-circle, two of the other warriors aims their weapon at Ava, sending a barrage of bolts against her. Halted in her step, Ava manages to parry the first and second bolts, but the third scrapes her arm, making her lose the grip on her lightsaber, and another two bolts catches her straight in the gut, sending her spinning to the ground. *Ava lost all her Hit Points, and must spend a Force Point if she wishes to survive*
Seeing the two combat-eager Jedi take heavy fire, the last trooper turns his attention towards the third Jedi, standing behind the other two, saber drawn. Raising his rifle, the warrior fires, but Lor deflects the blast easily.
For the second time in a very short period, Lor is watching his friends being gunned down like training dummies by the Mandalorian warriors. Once again, the terrifying rage that consumed him before begins to swell up inside him, but in the final moment, the young Jedi regains his senses. Raising his saber into the air, he yells.
"Close your eyes!"
Suddenly a blinding light erupts from his weapon, and Lorn instinctively closes his eyes. The soldiers arenÂ´t as lucky though, and are visibly shaken and disoriented by the sudden light. Dipping into the Force, Lor lowers his saber, readying to take advantage of this temporary boost.

Meanwhile, the battle rages on back at the base. In a daring maneuver, some of the remaining fighters manage to break free of their pursuit and finally puts the last Basilisk down.
From the walls, the militia soldiers manning the two E-Web emplacements continues to harass the advancing bulk of the Mandalorian army, but to little effect. The soldiers are too untrained, and the enemy advances nearly unscathed, returning fire that covers the base walls.
Near the breach, Nerrik can spot the small advance parties moving forward, still in their distance. Shouting out commands, the small squads under his command opens fire both from above the walls and behind him in the breach, meeting the soldiers head on. Being quite exposed as they approach, the Mandalorians takes heavy causalities, and nearly all the soldiers breaking closer falls, only a handful still standing. And while the returning fire splashes across the breached wall, Nerrik and his men finds themselves unharmed.

Those fighters just gave his men and himself a chance against the mandolorians on this backwater moon. And maybe, just maybe he might make it through this battle.
Taking a peek around his cover, Nerrik attempts to gage how far the advancing enemies are from him so he can determine what to do with his own attacks towards the enemies.
Looking back to his men after peeking out he hollars, "Don't Let up men," and hoping to steel their nerves, "Hold the Line, We will get through this together." Seeing one of his troopers drop another mandolorian ,"Great Shot Jenkins."

Given a moments respite by LorÂ´s timely intervention, Lorn takes a deep breath and then lunges himself at the nearest soldier, but weakened by his wound, his blow fails to even scratch the warriors armor. Still blinded, the warrior swings around, firing his rifle towards LornÂ´s assumed location. Through sheer luck, his shot finds home, but Lorn manages to gather the Force to him enough to disperse the blast.
Firing blindly, the remaining warriors shots flies wide around the small clearing, scoring burning holes into nearby trees.
On the ground, Ava slips into a state of unconsciousness.

Lorn swings his saber, but the loss of blood and the pain has left him dizzy, and his blade swings wide. Next to him, Lor has slightly better luck, scoring a hit in the side of the soldier, leaving a smoking mark where the blade hit.
Suddenly the soldiers backs off, lowering their weapons for a killing shot. However, where the exhausted Jedi expected red lancing bolts of laser, wide blue stunning arcs flies out, sending Lor and Lorn into unconsciousness next to Ava.
Some time later, Lorn regains consciousness. He finds himself shackled to hand and feet and is stuffed in what appears to be some sort of transport veichle. Next to him he can see Ava making slow movements as she wakes up. He can also spot Lor, still out flat, the stunning bolts apparently having affected him harder.
*You are all conscious again, and have 1 Hp. You have recovered you Hp and FS fully*
===================================================================
As the soldiers approaches, Nerrik heaves the boulder of the ground, sending it flying into the closest warrior, knocking him out. A point blank salvo from the soldiers behind him and on the wall decimates the opposing force even more, and only a few of the Mandalorian soldiers manages to even fire their weapons before falling.
The long-range weapons on the wall still trades shots with the approaching army, but shortly the invaders seems to be falling back, and the assault seems to be halted, at least for the moment.
As the soldiers cheer and relaxes, a mechanic comes running up to Nerrik.

As he comes to, Lorn starts to survey his surroundings. They appear to be inside a smaller vehicle, a troop transport of some sort from the looks of it. It is possible that the craft might be space-capable on its own, but it seems unlikely it has the resources to make a hyperspace jump on its own. There appears to be little more than around two dozen ready stations, seats for troopers with racks for gear and emergency life support equipment. There are no troopers inside the vehicle right now, but he can sense several outside.
Next to him, Ava strains her muscles as she exerts herself to try and test the strength of her bonds. She finds them to be far beyond her ability to break, and they appears to be made of a solid and dull metal.

Being stealthy is not easy, especially when ones hands and feet are restricted. Lorn manages a few steps before falling over and as he struggles to get to his feet, the head of a Mandalorian soldier shows in the open door.
The soldier laughs a bit while he picks up a piece of equipment from inside the ship.
"Feeling bad are we, Jedi? DonÂ´t worry, once weÂ´ve overrun the defenses of this feeble outpost, we shall take you to see the doctor"
Still laughing, the soldier leaves the veichle.

Reaching the console by the door, he realizes that operating a console with ones wrists bound behind ones back isnÂ´t the easiest thing. He manages to slam the button to shut the entrance to the transport, but before he can even make an attempt to lock it shut to prevent the Mandalorians from entering, the hatch slides open again, this time with multiple soldiers entering.
One of them, apparently an officer of some sort grunts and pushes Lorn away from the console.
