Kyoti flips another credit through the air at the Barkeep whilst sampling the locally produced drink. The drink swirled in it's glass as he playfully shook it, "So these ruins you mentioned, know anything more about them?"
Kyoti had spent the last few days in search of the supposed Jedi ruins, having left Tatooine in search of knowledge of the Jedi.

A small Aleena sits at the bar with a surprising number of empty glasses. He's not quite drunk yet, but it is obvious that he's well on his way. While finishing yet another glass, he overhears the Cerean talking to the Barkeep. He chuckles slightly; probably some curious tourist.

*Just another day in the neighborhood.*
Dorn's day had been pretty regular so far. Break up a fight, arrest everybody. Break up another fight, arrest them too. As he swung his left stun baton into the abdomen of a thug he'd caught roughing up some tourists, he hoped this time the brain dead moron would take the point and pass out.
Trouble with thugs, though, is that they don't listen too well.
Seeing the thug standing back up, Dorn sighed to himself before bringing both stun batons down reminiscent of the Twin Strike move he'd learned during his stay at the academy right here on Dantooine. The thug went down and stayed down this time.
Sighing, Dorn reached behind himself to hook the batons onto his belt before pulling out some mesh tape and tying the thug up. Calling it in via the comlink, Dorn stood up and waited for the pickup to arrive.
After the pickup came and went, Dorn check his chrono and realized that it was lunch time.
*No wonder my stomach was telling me to eat.*
Dorn sighed and headed off towards the cantina. Once he got there, he walked up to the bar and motioned to Nizka to give him his regular of nerf steak and eggs and a cup of Jawa juice.
Food in hand, Dorn looked around to see what else might be going on.

Davkas sat alone in the back of the Cantina, mostly for solitude but to give himself a full view of the place. He had only recently arrived Khoonda but he already felt like he had been there for too long.
Davkas had already fulfilled his contract to the local settlers by thinning the Kath Hounds, not much of a challenge but then their wasn't a lot of dangerous jobs on the backwater planet.
Davkas motioned to the server for another glass of Juma Juice, while waiting he scoped the room.

"Come on, This is quality Corellian Spiced Ale, its worth at least twice that much!" Kai argues with the Cantina Owner, trying to convince him to give the Duros a better price on the case of liquior she was trying to sell. Finally accepting a reasonable sum.

"I ain't heard nothin' but rumors but...they say that thousands of years ago, there was a Jedi Enclave right near Khoonda." The barkeep pauses as he fills another drink for a patron, then turns back to Kyoti to continue, "Supposedly, during the Jedi Civil War, it was destroyed by a Sith Lord. What was his name? Darth Metric, or somethin' like that? At any rate, there ain't nothing left now but ruins, don't know why you'd want to go there."
Dorn:

Sighing to himself, Dorn was happy for a moment's peace. At least long enough to eat his dinner. Sitting down at an empty table positioned so that he could see the door, Dorn dove into the steak and eggs. He was hungry and ate quite a bit for someone so slight. Dorn kept his attention on the room, however, so that he could get up at a moment's notice.

Charles looked around the rundown spaceport as he stepped off the cargo hauler, wondering if this was a really good idea. *Unfortunately, I only know that this is a good place to hide for a little while and that one of families old suppliers might still be here*,Charles thought as he walked down the ramp, his back pack over his left soulder. *Then again, it could be the force telling to come here.*
Charles nodded at one of the local guards as he walked from the pad where his latest mode of travel was on, quietly thinkning to himself and reflecting on what has happened to him. *After all, they say that the force works in mysterious ways.*
Looking around, Charles noticed a building with the tell tale signs that it was the local tavern, complete with a sleeping drunk lying next to a wall and in pool of drool. Sighing, Charles walked over to the building, knowing he might not really want to but at the same realizing he needs a drink and information on Dantooine.
Checking to make sure his sword and blaster were secures, Charles headed inside, hoping that nothing too terrible would happen.

"Um, excuse me, did you say something about the ruins of the Jedi Enclave?" asks a voice from behind Kyoti. It belongs to a young human. Not waiting for the Cerean to respond to his question, he continues, "I am in the process of planning an expedition there. Would you be interested in helping me? I'm willing to pay you, of course."

## Re: Episode I: The Fugitives

### **Tempeste** (2009-06-30 03:46:18)

The Cerean responds without turning his head, "Listen, if you help me find what I'm looking for, you won't have to pay me anything." Kyoti paused for a moment, finished his drink and then turned to face the source of the voice, "I'll help you."

Dorn's never been one to enjoy secretive gatherings and whisperings inside a cantina. It usually led to no good. Keeping his eyes on the human talking with the Cerean, he wolfs down his steak and eggs before getting up and handing the plate to Nizka. Standing next to the bar, Dorn walked over to the group and tapped the human on the shoulder.
"What's this gathering about? If you have business to conduct, I'd suggest you get about and not draw attention by standing about."

Davkas gets up from his seat after hearing about the expedition, he knew a thing about ruins but he could care less about what they were looking for, he was only interested in the credits.
Davkas steps up from behind the security officer and looks the Cerean over then does the same to the officer in silence.
While staring the officer down he speaks to the man Corwell.
"I understand you are in need of personnel, if you would like I can offer my service to care of any problems you might..."
He turns to Cromwell "...if so join me at my table and we will discuss the terms of my contract."
With his business proposal put of the way Davkas returns to his table without a word and waits for Mr. Corwell.

Turning to Dorn, Fenton says, "Ah, my apologies. I didn't mean to appear suspicious. I was just asking for people to help me in an expedition I'm making into the ruins of the Jedi Enclaves." As he finishes his sentence, he seems to take note of the number of people who seem interested in his conversation. "I could use as much help as I can get, if anyone else is interested?" He then pauses to listen to what Davkas has to say, and starts to reply before Davkas walks off. He blinks a few times, surprised by the abruptness of his departure, then shrugs. "Um, I guess, if anyone's interested in joining up, we'll be over there," he says as he points to Davkas's table. He then takes a seat across from Davkas and waits to see how many of the others follow.

Fenn chuckles some more. Turns out, there were more fools in the bar then he first thought. And yet...
Morbid curiousity got the better of him. He walked over to the table and sat down.
"Count me in. I have to be there to see the looks on your faces when you find nothing."
He looks at the Cerean, and adds, "Oh, and if he's not accepting payment, feel free to add it to my paycheck."

Charles slowly eased himself into the cantina, taking stock of who was there. *Not too crowded*, Charles thought as he headed up to the bar where a Cerean and a someone else was standing at before they left for a booth that was occupied by a single person.
*Well, let's see if any one here might be force sensitive*. Charles nodded at the bartender, pointing at a lomin ale before closing his eyes slightly and letting his senses flow out.
UTF @ +8 to see if any one here might be force sensitives around here.

Walking over with the group, Dorn leans with his palms on the table.
"Look, where you go is your business. However, if your constant mentioning of the Jedi should cause the Imperial troops to come down on top of us, I'm going to hold you responsible for this town. I've worked very hard to keep the Sith Empire out of here for a few years, not an easy thing to do. So, if you're heading in that direction, I'm following to make sure you get out of town afterwards."

### **Avarna** (2009-06-30 13:46:41)

The call was opened to everyone in the bar, so Kai stood up and walked over to the table. Unaware that she was the only non-Force Sensitive interested in the Jedi Ruins. "I'm willing to hear what you have to say." The Duros Female said taking a seat, not formally committing to the expedition until she's heard the details.

Fenton shakes his head at Kyoti's comment, saying, "Normally I'd agree with you, but I've heard rumors about some kind of monsters being inside there. We need as many people with us as possible to be safe." Turning to the others who had expressed interest, he says, "I can't pay much, but I really do need all the help I can get. I can pay you 2000 credits each upfront, and anything you find in the ruins you can always keep to sell or use or whatever you want to do with it."

Dorn moves towards the door, obviously waiting on everyone else.

## Re: Episode I: The Fugitives

### **Avarna** (2009-06-30 15:15:41)

Kai looks skeptical. "Your giving us 2000 credits up front, plus we can keep whatever we find? Well I am a rookie treasure-hunter, and that sounds awfully charitable on your part. So what are you getting out of this?" She asks Fenton looking directly at him.

Davkas nods at Corwell's offer of two thousand credits. "Then we have a contract as long as you understand that I am in charge of security and I am your bodyguard."
Davkas gets annoyed by the Cerean demanding what he will do and not do.
"First off Cerean, let's establish the Rules, One: "Mr. Corwell" is in charge not you." Davkas takes the last swig of his Juma Juice and continues "Two: if you have a problem with Mr. Corwell then you have a problem with me which leaves us to rule Three: If there is a problem I will remove that problem."
Davkas looks at the others at the table then back at the Cerean "Those are the rules so follow them or leave."
Davkas then takes his attention to the security officer "If the Sith had any more interest in this planets or it's ruins they would still be here or they will come back if they want, regardless of how safe you think you are."
Davkas then looks at Corwell "I'll make sure we are ready to go as soon as your ready Mr. Corwell."

### **Tempeste** (2009-06-30 15:56:02)

Kyoti almost breaks into laughter as the idiot adresses him, "Remove me eh? Because I don't have any issues with taking you outside and finishing this now. 'You only became interested when money was mentioned. Is that why you're here? To try and make money from the demise of the Jedi, the ones who defended your forefathers for centuries? No, I think the sith are much too close for my liking," He finishes, motioning towards the door, somewhat hoping the soldier would take him up on his offer, if only to quieten him down now before he caused any problems.

## Re: Episode I: The Fugitives

### **zenkatarn** (2009-06-30 16:37:42)

Fenton turns to Davkas, saying, "While I appreciate your concern, there's no need to fight each other over something as trivial as this. Kyoti, was it? I have no issue with allowing you first look at anything we find, but please remember you're not the only one in this group. We'll have to work together in order to succeed in this venture." Hearing the Duros's question, he says, "Merely the chance to study the ruins and try to learn something of history." He hides a sigh of exasperation, though not very well, and says, "Now if my terms are agreeable to everyone, I'd like to get underway as soon as possible?"

Dorn looks at the two arguing near the table. Sighing to himself, he pulls both of his stun batons from his belt and holds them at the ready.
*Always nice to meet the immature of the galaxy.*
"If you two are done with your bodily refuse expelation contest, I'd suggest we get out of here. The grown-ups have work to do."

## Re: Episode I: The Fugitives

### **Avarna** (2009-06-30 21:10:43)

Kai thought about what the man said. Not believing a word the man said. If he was really interested in just the ruins, he could have hired some locals to clear out some local predators. Not to mention the fact of not wanting to preserve the Jedi Artifacts...
"Alright." Kai Answered agreeing to go along with the expedition. Taking her blaster rifle off her shoulder, and double checking that the stun bayonet was affixed properly. "So when do we head out?"

Charles opened his eye, looking around the room to see if he can spot the force users when he noticed the group getting up to leave. *Well, now*, Charles thought as he placed a couple creds on the table and drained the last of his lomin ale. *Wonder if anything could be useful from these guys.*
Walking over to the group, Charles heard them talking about Jedi ruins. *Hmm. That sounds good, especially if I find something useful.* Charles walks up to the group when one of them draws two stun batons and another brought up a blaster rifle. *Better watch out for him*, Charles thought as he manuvered over to them.
"Hey all," Charles said, trying not to lock eyes with the more heavily armed guards. "I over heard you guys going to the ruins of the Jedi Enclave here on Dantooine. Mind if I tag along?" Charles tries to smile the best he can, hoping to persuade the group to bring him in. *Hope this works.*

### **zenkatarn** (2009-06-30 22:25:36)

Fenton smiles at Charles's question, saying, "Anything we can find." He looks around at all the assembled men and women of various races, and says, "Well if everyone's ready then let's go!" He walks out the door and begins heading towards the ruins, turning around briefly to make sure everyone is following him.

"Not far. Maybe thirty minutes out by foot." Fenton replies, pulling his blaster pistol from its holster on his belt and checking its power pack to be sure it's fully charged. He then half-turns to the others again and says, "I'd recommend you all check your weapons too, can't be too careful." With that, he resumes walking to the ruins.

Kai took a deep breath, Standing up and walking over to Fenton, hand outstreched. She'd been promised Credits upfront, and she wasn't going to begin any preparations without them. Her blaster rifle slung over her shoulders, as she looked over the rest of the men gathered. "You promised Credits up front."
If nothing else, they might find the equipment of some other scavengers that alone might be worth taking the exploration, But at her core Kai was an explorer, and wasn't about to pass up an opportunity like this one.

### **zenkatarn** (2009-07-02 20:53:02)

"Ah, you're right, of course." Fenton digs a 2000 credit chip out of his pocket and hands it to Kai. He then does the same for everyone else, including Kyoti, unless he refuses it. Once everyone receives their money (or not), he says, "Now then, let's be off!" and continues towards the ruins.

Picking up his portion of the credits, Charles started wondering what it was they're going after. *No on ejust hands out 2,000 credits for a simple exploration unless it is extremely valuable.* Sighing, Charles leaves with the rest of the group, careful to make sure his eyes were open.
*Haven't been out in the wilderness in a long time*, he reflected as he wiped the sweat from his forehead after a couple minutes hiking. *Hope these ruins aren't too far away.* Charles looked over at the rst of the group, noting their preparedness and decided to keep his blaster where it was for the time being. *After all, it will do better to let those with the heavy guns to pull security while the rest of us pull the relics.*

As a small breeze caught hold of his robes, Gisah rose from his meditative position. He had been here for some time now, trying to clear his mind, and deciding on what to do with his life next. Since he left the Aing-Tii, he had wandered about the Galaxy, trying to keep a low profile and figuring out a plan. So far, his plan was simple: Destroy the Sith. What was not simple was how to accomplish that. He hadnÂ´t managed to find any surviving Jedi during his travels, and that was why he had risked coming to these ruins, hoping that they would perhaps act as a beacon for other survivors.
He turned his head towards the entrance to the ruins. He hadnÂ´t yet entered, figuring that if someone was already inside, they would have to come out some time. He smiled. His hunter instincts hadnÂ´t eroded, and he had found a quiet spot to meditate, concealed enough that he would not be seen, but still providing him with enough of a vantage point to have a clear view of his surroundings. He had spotted the occasional beast moving by, but in the three days he had been here, he hadnÂ´t seen any sign of sentient life.

"There it is." Fenton says as the group reaches the top of a hill overlooking the ruins. "Now then, we'd best be careful. No telling what might be waiting inside." He draws his blaster, scanning the landscape in front of them.
The ruins are just that: ruins. It's run-down, crumbling, and covered in vegetation. Those of you with a connection to the Force feel a strong dark side presence inside, and even those without any special sensitivity to the Force can feel something dark in the air around what was once a haven for those of the light. As you gaze upon the ruins, a haunting growl emits from the structure echoing ominously.

Feeling the dark tremor in the Force, Dorn really wanted to reach behind himself and draw out his saber, but he didn't know about these others that were around him. He'd just have to trust in the Force to guide him as to when, if at all, to draw the saber.
As he moved through the ruins, Dorn kept his ears, eyes, and *other* senses open to any danger, all the while gripping his stun batons in his hands.

Gisah smiled as he heard the howl coming from inside the ruins. It appeared that he had been mistaken in what the ruins would attract. Getting tired of waiting, he decided that the time to act was now. Feeling the long metal cylinder at his side, he knew that whatever waited for him inside those ruins would be dangerous. But so was he, and he was unable to find a way to engage the Sith more directly, then perhaps his destiny followed a different path.
He got down on one knee, searching his immediate surroundings. Whatever was inside those ruins, it was not the only beast in these areas, and he would be ready for them all.

Charles looked up and at the ruins when the howl pierced the air, his senses overcomed from darkness. *This cannot be good*, Charles thought as he looked at the others before drawing his blaster. *I should draw my sword, but I might need that when what ever is in there comes out.*
Silently, Charles rechecked his blaster before looking at the others to see what they do.

The reptilian turns towards the voice, only to see that it was indeed a small group of people. He didnÂ´t get the impression that they were hostile, but he wouldnÂ´t chance.
"Question is, since itÂ´s so dangerous, what are *you* doing here? Have you come to plunder the relics of the Jedi, or have you some other purpose?"

Gisah focuses his eyes on the Cerean for a moment.

He takes a moment to look the group over.
"As for my own reason for being here...one might say it was the call of home. And the hope of finding allies"

Fenton's eyes go wide as he sees Gisah's lightsaber. He starts to reach for something hidden in a secret pocket in his tunic, but stops himself. Instead, he says, "I never thought that there would still be Jedi hanging around here. Surely you would think this place would have been searched by the Sith before anywhere else?" He then makes a point of placing his blaster on the ground and holding up his hands to show that they're empty. "Don't worry. If you're a Jedi, then we can be called friends. I have no love of the Sith."

Dorn narrowed his eyes at the reptilian flashing the lightsaber around. He quietly placed his stun batons on his belt before reaching behind his back, under his cloak and retrieving a long cylinder and holding it under his cloak. He had no intention of drawing attention to himself, but he also had no intention of being caught off guard by a potential Sith.
Reaching out with the Force, Dorn let his senses brush the reptile's mind, in search of the Dark Side.

Looking after the arrogant human who started to head towards the ruins, Gisah gave away a reptilian chuckle.
"A war is not lost until one side surrenders or is anihilated. But I guess it matters little to cowards. Just tell me something, little human, are you happy with the Sith running things? But by all means, let us proceed to see hat can be found inside these tombs"

Fenton nods, satisfied that the Chistori is not a Sith. He motions to the others still behind him and says, "Yes, let's go in." He follows Davkas as he walks up to the only still-functioning door. It seems that someone, in recent history, had hooked it to a power generator and installed a new control panel, as the old one had apparently been removed.

The room you enter into is what you think was once a lobby or greeting area. There are hallways that lead off to the left and right of you, each of them turning in the same direction before they extend very far. A door is in front of you which seems operational. To the right of it, a torn and partially eaten corpse lies, still clutching a datapad.
"Anything we can find." Fenton replies as he steps through the doorway after Kyoti.

"Mr. Corwell I would suggest you answer her question otherwise we may have two more dead bodies to add to this grave yard of the Jedi."

How about, you lower your rifle, she lowers her pistol, and our friend back there lowers his *weapon*. Then, our dear Mr. Corwell can answer the lady's question, as it's something that I'm sure we're all curious about. If you shoot her, however, I'm fairly certain you'll die.

He reaches into a hidden pocket of his tunic and withdrew a long, metal cylinder. A lightsaber! He presses the activation switch, revealing a yellow blade that filled the room with light. "I am Fenton Corwell, a Jedi Apprentice. I was sent here to investigate the rumors of some kind of monster infesting the ruins, and ascertain whether or not it...or they, pose a threat to the city and its people."

"Looks like everyone here has lost it, huh? Well, let me try and help here, and I'll use simple Basic so you can get it.
Kid, the Jedi are dead. D. E. A. D. Dead. Whatever dillusions you have, get rid of them. The only thing that's going to come from calling youself a Jedi is eventually you'll find a Sith's lightsaber in your gut."

"Not so dead as you'd think Fenn" States Kyoti as he decides whether or not to remove the lightsaber from Davkas's back so he could illustrate his point more clearly, despite the fact he isn't a jedi at all.
He takes a few steps back from Davkas before turning to face Fenn, pushing the ridged switch on the sabers sleek handle and causing the yellow blade to sprout from the emitter. "Regardless of whether the Jedi live, their legacy still exists, I think our location speaks for that itself."

Kyoti almost responded to Fenn before Fenton spoke out, "So.. It's true? You're still around?" he seems almost breathless with the questions, perhaps he'd soon be able to find the answers he longed for. About his abilities and why his parents died.. Maybe the Jedi had records of the Sith attacks?

Reaching underneath his robes, Dorn holstered his stun batons. The debate raged on inside his head. Should he reveal himself? He knew the reptile wasn't a Sith, even if it had once given itself to anger. And, the lack of specificity from the Force about Fenton indicated one of two things; 1. he wasn't a Sith. 2. He was and he was powerful enough to hide himself, meaning he was powerful enough, also, to detect Dorn. In either case, hiding his identity probably wouldn't help anybody, espcially not himself.
When his right hand had hooked the baton to his belt, he reached behind his back and found the cylindrical grip of his saber. Drawing it out from underneath his cloak, he ignited one of the ends, the familiar snap-hiss sounding good to his ears and the slight vibration feeling good in his hand. The blue blade cast a slight shadow around him as he flourished the blade back and forth.
"Is this the point where we exchange the secret handshake?"

Still, you're right. I was sent here to deal with whatever is in here, and we should get to work." Even as he says this, the front door shuts behind the group, locking them in!

Despite her aim, Kai's shot goes wild and misses the Rakghouls.
Fenton grits his teeth, annoyed by the interruption and the pain from the scratch one of the creatures landed on him. He swings his saber down with both hands, decapitating the Rakghoul that had attacked him.

Fenn was frustated by the lack of effect from his attack, but at least was glad that so many others wished to make themselve targets for the creatures rather than let him get into melee.
Attempting to get a better shot this time, Fenn carefully line up the barrel of his blaster with one of the creatures.

Fenn's shot once again sails over the Rakghouls, adding another scorch mark to the ceiling.
Kyoti successfully leaps past the Rakghouls, but his attack misses.
The Rakghoul Kyoti leaped over looked around, unable to find his target. It instead runs up to Gisah, scratching him (5 damage). The other remaining Rakghoul continues to attack Dorn, but misses, and is cut across the gut by one of Dorn's counterattacks. (Didn't spend your FP, Kor, you rolled high enough to hit on the die, and your other roll was too low to hit even with a FP.)

Davkas knew well enough that if the Jedi die it wasn't a big deal as they were the enemies of the ruling Sith Empire but the others would still cause him to get arrested if they were killed.

Gisah hissed threatingly as the Rakghouls claws raked his armor-clad skin. He was no stranger to pain, neither giving it or inflicting it. But he suspected what was to come might be sort of a shock to the beast. Knocking the beast back a bit with his shoulder, he forces his lightsaber forward with enough force to run straight through the creature.

Charles and Fenton stumble over each other as they try to attack the remaining Rakghoul, causing both their attacks to miss.

Bringing his double saber's hilt around his body, Dorn flourished the spinning blue shafts of cool plasma around and in a circle above his head, then bringing them both in for strikes against the Rakghoul's body again. He continued to rely on the Force to guide him.

Kyoti saw only read as the beast ran from him, before being promtply cut down. He narrowed his eyes and looked at the blade of his saber and then at the soldier who'd just hit him. The hilt was cold in his hand yet anger began to grow within him. Did the soldier attack him on purpose? If not then one with such a bad aim would do more harm to him than good anyway. His arm tensed as his heart pumped faster.

Fenn's shot is dead on, creating a smoking hole in the Rakghoul's head. It slumps over, dead, leaving the room silent except for the hum of the still activated lightsabers.
Kyoti finds himself in a very short hallway that leads to a door that appears to be locked. To either side of him are small alcoves where the Rakghouls had apparently been eating, judging by the scraps of food on the ground.
Fenton deactivates his saber, hooking it to his belt. "Well, now we know what's in here." He walks over to the enterence, examining the door. "Hm, locked. Magnetically sealed, it looks like. I don't think we'll be able to open it," he says, pointing to the smoking remains of the panel next to it, which used to control the door. "We'll have to look for another exit when we're ready to leave, I guess."

Dorn finished a flourished swing through what should have been the monster's chest, only to find that the creature had instead decided to die earlier than Dorn had expected. Allowing the momentum of the spin to carry the double saber into a circular flourish, Dorn deactivated the blades and stood there, catching his breath.
Hearing the other's question, Dorn shook his head in the negative. But, he decided against lowering his guard completely. Just because they'd killed some, didn't mean there wasn't a larger nest down below.

Taking a few breaths to steady himself, Gisah deactivated his saber. He listened to Fendon and shook his head.
"I wouldnÂ´t count on those things being the only creatures lurking around in here. But before we move on, I think there are some things we should clear out first"
He looks around at the group, his eyes lingering a little longer on the non-Jedi members of the party.
"It seems like there are some people here who have a problem with Jedi. They need to stop that ,*now*. IÂ´m not trying to order anyone into anything, but if we are to work together, we canÂ´t have that kind of stuff hanging over us. So if anyone has anything to say, letÂ´s clear the air here and now"

Dorn looked over at Kai and sighed.
"Man. You're right about someone seriously hating this thing. Could it be hotwired? Or maybe one of us could cut it open?"
Turning towards Gisah as the large lizard made his statement, Dorn nodded his agreement.
"We can't work together if we're constantly watching our own backs against our supposed allies as well as our enemies. So, does anyone want to say something? Because, Like Gisah was saying, I'd bet there's something else down here. The Force tends to attract things to it. We could have one or even more nests of other things down here."

Slightly irritated by the rest of the group that just moved on, especially the large-mouthed soldier who at least earlier had expressed a very distinct opinion of the Jedi. The Chistoti Jedi turned his head from Fenn to Davkas.
"What about you pal? Did that big mouth of yours suddenly grew thin when someone asked you to stand for your opinions? Because it seems you have issues with Jedi, and like I said, we should really resolve them here and now"

Dorn, with his deactivated double saber in his hand, looked over at the Aleena and nodded his head.
"If that's how you feel, then no wonder you doubt. However, the mere fact that there are several of us here and now proves that we haven't lost yet. We're still here, listening to the will of the Force, which called each of us here. There is no such thing as coincidence, which means that the Force has something in mind for us.
"If you doubt us, my friend, then I guess we have some proving to do."

But I don't care what we do, nothing is going to prove to me that some cosmic intellect is guiding things in the right direction.

"I have several issues lizard, first off we all were lied too for a job, I am stuck in ruins again with a bunch of Jedi who don't understand the concept of losing a war....."
The Large Soldier turns his head then his Assault Rifle towards the Lizard pointing him out with it.
"Not to mention the fact that you call yourself a Jedi but you act more like a Sith and I would know."
The Soldier turn again and acknowledges the two others walking with him and nods his head forward as a sign to follow him, as he continues down the hall with his last few words giving the Sith like Jedi his choice.

Realizing that he wonÂ´t make any more points heard right now, Gisah offers a small nod to Dorn, who seemed to be one of the more sensible in the group.
"Agreed. I suspect we will find more pressing matters inside these ruins"
Before proceeding though, he turns back to Davkas.
"IÂ´m not entirely convinced that attacking you wouldnÂ´t be a productive thing, and I highly doubt that you would be able to best me, but lets leave the matter alone, for I have no intention or desire to fight you.
But I want to make three things clear. One, it is only you, not me, who were hired for a job. IÂ´m here of my own free will, offering assistance, free to do whatever I wish. Two, even if the full-scale war is over, that doesnÂ´t mean the battle between Jedi and Sith is. Not while I can still breathe. And third, donÂ´t *ever* call me a Sith. I might have gained a new perspective on the Force since the Purge, but I am far from Sith.
But letÂ´s get on with matters now, shall we, and resolve our differences later?"
In an gesture of peace, Gisah stretched out his hand towards the human. While he waited for the manÂ´s response, he turned to Fenn.
"I donÂ´t believe that either. The Force wonÂ´t fix things for us, weÂ´ll have to do that ourselves. Right now, that includes getting rid of the Sith. Remind me to show you how to kill one some day"

Kyoti is surprised to find that his lightsaber, rather than plunge through the door as he intended, is shorted out and deactivates as it strikes the door.

The laughter he had heard coming from behind the door didnÂ´t scare him at all. He knew that whoever had made that laugh fed on their fear, and that made him angry. And that anger, *he* fed on, so the denizens of this ruins better be prepared.
