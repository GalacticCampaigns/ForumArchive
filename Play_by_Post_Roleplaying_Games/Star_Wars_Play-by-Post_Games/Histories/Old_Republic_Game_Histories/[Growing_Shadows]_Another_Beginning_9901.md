# [Growing Shadows] Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-04-08 19:35:50)

In the apprenticesâ€™ dormitories, Ben and Tonin fought Jolan Yomato in a duel and after she found Ben worthy, ended the battle. After resting up and another confrontation with Jolan (this time a verbal with Kara), all of you made your way to the research center where the Force Harvester is being kept. Upon arrival, you came across Darth Jut-hakk and a couple of his guard assassins. A confrontation ensued and after his guards were taken down Jut-hakk called for reinforcements. Footsteps were heard and Jolan and Lexi stepped off of the lift. Lexi engaged with Lanius and Jolan stopped dead in front of Tanya. The battle continued with Jolan and Tanya holding action. Lexi took out Lanius and with a plea from Tanya, Jolan turned on Lexi, turning the tide of the fight.
Even with the appearance of more assassins, Ben was able to take down Jut-hakk. The assassins then proceeded to activate the self-destruct. In a hurried attempt, Ben, Tanya and Kara, managed to deactivate the Force Harvester and with it in Lanius's possession everyone made their way out of the doomed fortress with Tonin's and Jolan's guidance.
Now some distance from the collapsed structure, Tonin and Jolan stare at it almost at a loss.
After a few moments, Jolan turns to Tanya and finally seems at peace. "You must tell me everything, daughter."
> Kara sighs at the sight of the crumbled building, she was going to have to tell Sansai all the fun he missed while readying the ship. Steping up to Tonin she lays a hand on his arm and smiles &quot;We should get you bandaged up at least until we get to the ship.&quot;

Ben looks around at the group. "So what becomes of us now. Do we continue traveling together or do we all go our separate ways?"

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-04-12 00:53:11)

Kara smiles at the man "I wouldn't mind..I've found I rather enjoy the trouble you seem to get in."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **thelastfool** (2008-04-12 11:03:32)

Ben smiles. "I do get in a lot of trouble... don't I. and it's because of you that I still get to cause so much trouble. I don't think I would be alive right now if I hadn't met you."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-04-12 11:29:46)

Jonin and Tanya move away from the others to talk quietly to each other.
Lexi groans as she starts to regain consciousness. She had been dropped unceremoniously on the ground by Jolan after their arrival outside the fortress.

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-04-12 11:30:19)

Tonin looks at the building fall. A wired feeling comes over him kind of almost a relfe that it is over. His friend has been advenged and he is free to move on. "Well now, what should I do with my self after this?" Tonin smiles. "Maybe I can travel with you, for awhile untill I find something. Force willing." Tonin knows that there are only one or two of them that will expected him the other would more likely kill him here and now. Thinking to himself. *"They can try if they like. If that is the will of the Force then so be it."*

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-04-12 21:01:08)

Kara smiles at the man "Well, I shall have to make sure you are able to continue to make trouble!" she chuckles as she makes her way over to the groaning woman on the floor "Tonin, I think she's coming around"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-04-14 13:23:17)

"Hmm. Sorry I was lost in thought." Tonin looks down at the woman laying on the ground. "You seem alittle worse for ware. Little rest and you should be fine." Tonin turns his attention to Kara. "Our you sure your friends will want me around given our history. I have cause you all some trouble and injury in the past."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-04-14 17:15:00)

Kara smiles up at the sith and chuckles softly "I don't know about the others, but I want you around, besides..you did help us."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-04-17 11:50:32)

"Maybe I will travel with you lot for awhile not like I have anything else right now." Tonin says with a smile. "Besides I find at least you to be plesent company." Tonin looks a Kara. "Well no need in staying around here. I think we should at least head back to the ship and leave."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-04-17 12:18:57)

Kara smiles at the sith then looks down to the woman that was waking "what should we do with her?"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-04-17 13:58:08)

"Not really sure, if she behaves herself we could bring her along and maybe cut her loose some where." Tonin feels pity for her. Her fate is kind of i his hands now. "If she doesn't mind her manners I could dispatch her and be done with it." "What do you think?" Tonin looks at Kara waiting for her answer.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-04-17 14:31:57)

"I suppose bringing her with wouldn't be so bad..at the least we could take her somewhere to be detained." Kara hums in thought then looks up to the sith "Lets get back to the ship." She stands and wraps and arm around the woman to try and take her with them.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **thelastfool** (2008-04-17 15:23:51)

Ben had already started back to the ship while Tonin and Kara were looking at the woman.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-04-17 16:31:16)

The loud thrum of starship engines can be heard heading towards you and soon a blue and silver Dynamic class ship comes into view. Spotting the group it lands close to your position and the ramp is lowered.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-04-17 16:56:17)

"This our ride I take it?" Looking at Kara and trying to help with the Sith that was on the ground. " Or should I start to be worried?" Tonin waits to see who comes down the ramp.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-04-17 18:48:42)

Kara watches the ship curiously "Unless sansai got a new one we might want to start worrying.."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Vash** (2008-04-18 01:41:05)

A mando in matching blue and silver Mandalorian Neo-Crusader armor with two blaster at his side walks down "Something tells me you need a ride" he said with a bit a laugh as he looked at them "So you coming or am I leaving you guys here?"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-04-18 13:54:15)

Kara looks at the others then back "who are you?" she asks as she searches through the force to see if he was really there to help them
*UtF +11 search feelings*

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-04-18 19:38:25)

"We will take a ride if you are offering." Tonin hand moves to his lightsaber.
"If you are friendly and mean use no harm, then help us get the wounded loaded and we can depart this place." Tonin starts to worry alittle. He can really use the Force to do anything but inhance his fighting abilitys.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **thelastfool** (2008-04-18 19:43:13)

"Did something happen to our ship... is that why you're here?"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-04-18 22:09:44)

Kara softly mutters to Tonin beside her "I don't sense he's here to hurt us.." at Ben's comment she looks up "Is Sansai alright? the Kushiban that was with our ship?"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Vash** (2008-04-19 10:49:31)

The mando sighed "My names Bendak Starkiller and i was sent here by the republic. I'm you new ride so get it or I'll leave you here to find your own ride" he said as he turned around and walked up the ramp. He stopped and turned around midway up "Oh id you touch anything that I didn't say was ok the I'll shot you myself"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-04-19 12:56:43)

"Charming fellow isn't he." Tonin helps Kara with the Sith warrior on the ground to the ship. "I wonder if all of your associates will be as nice as him." "I think we better get amove on or he might actually leave us here."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-04-19 14:23:00)

Kara helps Tonin with getting the Sith to a seat frowning at the attitude of this new 'associate' as the sith put it "Charming. Excuse me a moment will you." She then moves to the one place she would presume a pilot to be. "Where is the Kushiban that was with our old ship, you must know."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Vash** (2008-04-20 12:25:06)

Bendak looked back at her "I wasn't paid to know what happened to know and nor do I care to know. Now sit down, shut it, and buckle up lady. This is my ship so we follow my rules" he said as he turned around started warming up the ship ."Don't like there's the door" he said pointing to the ramp. As he did an astromech rolled up and started beeping "There you are X-90" he said as he turned around. The astromech beeped a few time and Bendak stared at him then pointed to a computer "I have no idea what your saying so plug in" he said in an annoyed tone. The mech plugged itself in and a message in mand'o cam across the screen "Ok well...I'm sure they'll understand" he said as he continued warming up the ship and checking all his systems.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-04-20 17:01:35)

Kara frowns at the man then looks to the droid "understand what? what's he saying?"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **thelastfool** (2008-04-21 11:50:46)

Ben looks at Bendak "Where are you taking us and what is going on?". He moves his hand close to one of his newly aquired sabers.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Vash** (2008-04-21 12:11:49)

Bendak look at them "You know if you don't trust me then you can get off *my* ship" he said in an annoyed tone "Ok sense your asking so many questions I'll tell you where we're going" he said as he turned around and checked a few things "We're headed to another ship, the Titan's Valiant. Thats the people that hired me, now I'm only going to say it one more time sit down, shut up, and buckle up" he said as he looked at X90 "Ok go get some of the rations for my new, and very annoying, passengers...hope you guys don't mind but I really don't have a big verity of rations, I'm sure you'll understand. Now is there anything else before we get out of here?" he asked turning around and crossing his arms

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-04-21 12:19:01)

Kara looks over to Ben and then back "Can you take us to our other ship so we may pick up our supplies and our pilot?"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-04-24 12:50:18)

Lanius secures the dormant Force Harvestor in a cargo container and buckles up in the cockpit. Jolan and Tanya continue their conversation on the lounge.
With everyone on board, Bendak starts up the ship and it takes off. On its way to orbit, it flies low enough to the capital city to show everyone in the cockpit the debris from what was the starport. After breaking through the atmosphere, a fire fight between Jut-hakks surviving followers and the Republic fleet can be seen in the distance.
Setting course Bendak directs the ship toward a familiar cruiser, the Titan's Valiant, which has separated itself from the battle.
An indicator on the console informs those in the cockpit a transmission is incoming.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-04-24 13:18:23)

Tonin turns to who ever is in the lounge with him. "Well at least we are off the planet and are away from the rest of my former friends." Tonnin trys to find a place to set down and strap in as the Mando had insturced. " I am pretty sure that your friends in the Republic will not be happy to see me alive and breathing. I wonder what kind of welcome I will recive?"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-04-24 13:26:09)

Kara sighs and straps in near the Sith she was starting to concider a friend "don't worry..you helped get us out and secure the harvestor..they can't be that mad." She smiles and chuckles "I'll protect you."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-04-24 13:38:22)

Tonin turns to Kara. "I hope they will be as understanding as you. I will try not to tarnish your reputation with them if I can." Tonin smiles at her. She maybe the only person on his side and he can iagine why that is. *"The Force much truely work in mysterious way indeed."* He thinks to himself.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-04-24 13:49:50)

Kara leans over and pats his arm "Don't worry.." she smiles reasuringly and leans back in the seat, worry for her kushiban friend filling her.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Vash** (2008-04-26 12:32:05)

Bendak flips a switch "This is the Physalis go ahead" he said as he looked back twords the passenger area "You know I really don't like these guys X90, they ask too many questions and they don't respect the fact that this is my ship" he said as he sighed "Well lets get this done with so I pay off this ship" he said as he turned back to the controls

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-04-26 12:39:50)

~Physalis, you are authorized to land in bay 2, Captain Prius will be waiting in the war room to meet with you and your passengers, Titan's Valiant out.~
"**We should dock immediately and not keep Capt Prius waiting for long.**" Lanius says to Bendak.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Vash** (2008-05-01 13:06:29)

"Alright I'll be there asap" he said as hen flipped the switch. Bendak flipped another switch "Hey we're going to be docking soon" he said. He looked around and spotted the Titan's Valiant "Ok Go tell the others that we're here and to get the cargo ready" he said as he approached the ship

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-05-01 14:37:57)

Kara leans back into her seat with a sigh, waiting for to dock. "I wonder what we'll be doing now.."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Vash** (2008-05-04 01:19:55)

Bendak flipped a switch "Hey Prius this is Bendak. I've got your cargo here and I'm coming in" he said as landed ship. "Alright we're here so get your cargo and get going, I need to talk to a few people" he said in a cold tone

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-05-04 02:54:47)

Kara frowns at the call, and sighs as she undoes the saftey restraint and moves to the unconcious Jedi. She undoes the womans restraints and takes hold of her, looking to the other Sith for help.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **thelastfool** (2008-05-05 13:12:17)

Ben gets up from his sit and heads off the ship after making sure he didn't forget anything.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-05-05 13:19:37)

Exiting the ship, there is a greeting party waiting consisting of a few guards and Capt Prius's second in command.
When he sees the first person to come off the ship, he says "Greetings from Captain Prius. She wishes to speak with all of you immediately. When you're ready please follow me."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-05-05 15:03:44)

"Ready as we will ever be my good sir." Tonnin says. "Lead the way." Tonnin looks around the ship that they are on. It looked like any other ship he had ever been on. He follows his new friends to the meeting with the Captain something or other. *"I guess I have traded one taskmaster for another. No matter I must make myself usefull and try not to give poor Kara a bad name for trusting me."*Tonnin thinks to himself. "Is are Mando friend going to be coming with us?"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-05-05 15:11:03)

Kara sighs and rolls her eyes, "No one help, I can do this myself.." She sighs, but chuckles softly, she seemed to have picked up a few things from her furry friend *'hope he's ok..'* she thinks as she drags the Sith woman from the ship.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-05-11 22:12:16)

The man leads all of you into Captain Prius' meeting room. And you all see the middle aged female captain sitting watching out a view port at the still ensuing battle outside.
As the door closes she turns and looks up at all of you.
"Ah, I see you all have safely returned. We feared the worst when the city was severely damaged. You probably noticed that the spaceport was destroyed."
She holds up a hand before any of you can speak. "Your Kushiban comrade is fine. He managed to take off in the Solaris before then and has been assisting us on some other matters I won't go into."
Looking to Lanius she says. "I assume your mission was completed successfully?"
Lanius nods and motions towards the bag.
"Very good, Master Lanius. I will leave what happens to the device in your care, and if you wish to employ any one to assist you then you have my complete support." She looks pointedly at all of you including Bendak.
"If there is nothing else, I must take my leave."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Vash** (2008-05-12 19:37:45)

Bendak looked around and then looked at the Cpt. "Hay how about my payment, look my ships good but its seen a lot of combat before and I need to do some mantince on it." he says a little impatiently. He looks to the others and back to the Cpt. "So if you don't mind I would like my creds so i go pay for a few things"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-05-12 19:42:00)

Capt. Prius turns to Bendak and replies "All repairs will be taken care of and the agreed upon credits have been transfered to your account." She looks at the others.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-05-12 22:53:04)

Kara looks around to the others of the group, she was thankfull to her the kushiban was alright, but hoped they'd get to see eachother again *'he did promise to take me places.'*

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-05-15 19:23:23)

Tonin doesn't seem to care about what happens to the Froce harvester. He only cared that he wasn't being escourted out in chains for what he was. He is uneasy around the Jedi Master, kind of expecting him to cut him down but he seems to be keeping himself in check fairly well. "So is there anything else for us to do?" "I mean you don't expect us to just hang around here forever do you?" Tonin has desided that the Sith have one thing over the Jedi they don't wait for the Force to move them they act.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-05-28 10:48:42)

With nothing else required of her, Niandra Prius turns and leaves the briefing room.
Lanius sits back in his chair and eyes you all wearily. "I know I have put you through a lot over this past year, but I'm afraid I must ask for your continued assistance. Though the Force Harvestor is dormant for the time being, I fear it may one day become reactivated. I wish for you to transport me to the spirit of Ulic Qel-Droma where it is my hope a safe location or a means to destroy can be found. Though Jut-hakk has been thwarted, it is my fear there are still other sects will try to fill the void left by Jut-hakk's diminished power."
"Unless you have any questions, I suggest we leave as soon as possible."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-05-28 13:46:35)

Kara moves over to the Jedis side and lays a hand on his shoulder "when we get back into the ship I suggest you try to a sleep a little."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Vash** (2008-05-29 13:04:36)

Bendak looked at the others "As long as I'm getting paid I don't care. So is it just passengers or do we need to load up some cargo as well?" he asked looking at Lanius

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-05-29 14:21:05)

Lanius nods in agreement to Kara then addresses Bendak. "You will be compensated as was agreed in your contract. There will be mainly passengers. The only cargo is in this bag." He motions to the bag carrying the Force Harvester. Lanius stands picking up the bag, looking at the others. "I'm sure Niandra has seen to the rest of you being compensated as well, though no amount of currency could show my gratitude for your assistance."
Glancing at Tonin, he says. "Though, I can only hope currency is not all you want."
"In any case, if you would to pick up any supplies while we are here, now would be the chance. Captain Bendak, if you wouldn't mind I will proceed you to your ship and take a bunk."
(( 1500 credits has been added to everyone's accounts with the exception of Bendak and Tonin... I guess that just leaves Kara... ))

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-06-02 13:06:40)

Lanius stands, collects the bag and leaves the meeting room. Kara, Bendak and Tonin are left to prepare for the next leg of the journey.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-06-02 13:59:54)

Kara sighs and pulls her hair from the ties that were holding it in the tail, letting her hair fall "Well...I suppose I should check for any medical supplies, better to be safe than sorry later. Would you like to come with me Tonin?"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-06-03 01:25:19)

Tonin looks at his freind. "Of course I would be delighted to. Besides it is getting borring in here to many Jedi for my taste." Tonin follows Kara out of the room. "Kara if I may ask this. Why do you care what happens to me, I am a Sith you are Jedi we don't see eye to eye on anything. I mean no disrespect I am just cureous is all." Tonin seems alittle embrassed by the question.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-06-03 01:29:26)

Kara turns to him with a smile "You opened my eyes to things I was blinded to, doesn't matter what side you see or what side I see, so long as we fight together, it doesn't matter." she smiles and takes his hand tugging on it "come on, lets go find some supplies. We'll need all we can to keep this bunch alive."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-06-03 01:41:54)

Tonin moves along with Kara. Around her he feels lighter, alittle less darker. It is all confussing to him but he likes it. "Well I guess after a our last outting I would say Medical Supplys would be a good idea. I also have some thing I need to pick up."
"Some of the thing I could show you your Masters do not want you to know, but I suppose there are things we could teach each other."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-06-03 01:57:02)

Kara smiles at him, still holding onto his hand lightly "There's a lot we could teach eachother, and we have a while to learn it all. Maybe we can even find a way to balance the force." She couldn't remember the last time she felt so happy around someone, well...a human atleast, around the kushiban she was happy but..this felt different, though she dare not put a name to it.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-06-04 11:03:58)

Kara and Tonin:
Making your way through the ship, you eventually find yourselves in the ships PX. There you are able to buy any supplies you will need at the regular cost.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-06-09 12:40:10)

Assuming that is all you wanted to accomplish; All of you are now back on the ship. You find Lanius in the ship's lounge speaking with a Duros.
Lanius looks up at all of you as you enter. "Ah, good. You have returned. May I introduce Proboss." He motions to Duros.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-09 19:14:12)

The indicated green skinned Duros stands in a relaxed pose, arms at his sides. He is dressed in a pair of olive green overalls, with a mustard yellow fitted shirt and brown tankers boots. He wears a well-worn utility belt at his waist. He looks up at the approach of the others, and seems to scan the incoming group.
**"Either one of you Captain Bendak by chance? I feel somewhat guilty in not observing the old customs."**
He ponders for a moment, thinking to himself:
*At least it is an interesting ship, wonder what's up with the colors though…haven't seen those since the war….and who are these people, they seem pretty optimistic so far…*

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-06-09 19:55:49)

Kara walks in, having found nothing of great importance that couldn't wait, even if she did want that new stainless steel sergical kit. Stepping into the ship, she seemed to remember that the entire time her hand had been in Tonins. She smiles at him, as she removes her hand from his and bows slightly to the Duros "hello, My name is Kara, I'm the medic for the ship."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-11 02:54:16)

Nodding his head, and grinning at Kara,
**"Where are my manners! Hello, there to you as well. My name is Proboss, and assuming that I get the opportunity to be such, I hope to be the ships mechanic. I always appreciate seeing a medical professional on any journey, especially during these dangerous days."**
Noticing the hand-holding going on, Proboss raises an eyeridge. *Ahh, human love. So…interesting. They seem opposites at least in apparel choices…I wonder if there is more going on there…not like I won't have time to find out I suppose…*
**"Have you seen Captain Bendak by chance? I wish to formally request permission to board and serve. I understand it is a little late, but I would hope that he…or is it she?…would forgive my minor oversight. Captain Prius was insistent that I get aboard quickly so as not to delay your departure. Also, if accepted here, I have several questions regarding this vessel and upgrades that she may have been through."**

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-06-11 10:09:13)

Kara smiles gently at the mechanic, he seemed quite nice to her "The Captin is around somewhere, he should be on the ship I would think..though I'm not sure." She turns to the Sith beside her and smiles "Ah, and this is Tonin, he's only just come aboard from our previous mission. As for upgrades I'm afraid I, at least, can't answer those; I do hope you find the Captin for that though."
She looks at those present "I'm going to make sure my equipment is clean after all we've been through, Proboss it was a pleasure meeting you, I'm sure we'll work well together; and you can usually find me in the medbay." She looks again to Tonin with a smile and a light touch to his shoulder before making her way to her place on the ship to clean her surgical tools.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Vash** (2008-06-11 13:02:49)

Bendak had left to pay off a small chunk of what he had owed on the ship and was walking back "That should keep him happy for now" he said as he looked at his ship and smiled "But it's all worth it. This ship is a great piece of work and soon it will all be mine." He walked up the his ship and walked right past Lanius and the other not even saying hello or looking at them. He walked to his main quarters and began to clean his blasters as X-90 rolled in and began beeping "What do you mean there more people on my ship?" he asked. X-60 beep and whined and then Bendak look back at the main lounge and saw a new person.

Finishing his introductions with Kara and Tonin, Proboss was about to turn back to Master Lanius when he spots the Mandalorian enter the ship and head behind him.
Proboss turned and watched him walk by with a look of shear terror on his face, his jaw dropping as he slowly tracked the Mandalorian walk by. *A Mando…a nerf-herding MANDO! OH! Captain Prius said NOTHING about this. My debt to her is PAID! She might even owe me one this time…*
After the Mandalorian disappears into his quarters, Proboss audibly closes his mouth, and regains his composure, squaring his shoulders and strengthing his posture.
Just as the Captain Bendak came out into the lounge, Proboss turned, standing almost at attention with a small piece of flimsiplast in his hand. **"Captian Bendak Starkiller, my name is Proboss and though belated, I request permission to board, Sir. Also, I have here a letter of recommendation from Captian Prius for you. I hope to secure employment, as it were, as your ships mechanic. A cover story for my assignment to assist Master Lanius in reaching the completion of this mission."**
He stands with severe posture, holding out the letter of recommendation for Captain Starkiller.

Bendak looked at him and then looked to Lanius and then looked at Proboss "Ok first off you can calm to be my mechanic, but if you touch anything in this ship I will shoot you out an airlock" he said as he crossed his arm "Secondly you don't work me, so I'm not paying you a single cred, but if you working for Lanius I don't have a choice" he sad as he held out his hand "If you prove useful I might try and hire you after this is all said and done. If there's nothing else welcome aboard the Physalis"

**"Thank you, Captain. I appreciate your welcome to the Physalis."** Proboss reaches forward and hands Captain Starkiller the flimsiplast. **"I understand your feelings regarding your ship, and I will respect them, though I feel that it is a disservice to not use my abilites while you have use of them. I shall attempt to curb my interest and stay out of your way. Also, I was not attempting to weedle credits out of you, but work as a ships mechanic in lieu of paying you anything for my passage. If you prefer not to have me work, once again that is your choice and I will do my best to honor your wishes."**
Proboss pauses for a moment, looking down to his gear bag and rubbing his scalp for a moment.
**"The only question I do have though is if this a standard layout for the Dynamic class frigates? I ask because if it is, where do you prefer I should bunk and rack out? If not, are there particular room assignments?"**
He pauses for mere moments, looking about the lounge. His attention is obviously still toward Captain Starkiller, but it is apparent that his mind is beginning to wander. *I haven't had a chance to work on one of these recently…oh well, it would have been fun to really put some work into this ship…*

Lanius watches the exchange between Bendak and the newcomer Proboss before interjecting to say, "Captain, will we be departing soon? I am most anxious to arrive at the temple of Rhen Var."

"Yeah we'll leave now" he said as he turned and started to walk away "By the way I don't care where you sleep, just stay out of my room" he said over his shoulder. He walked up to the cockpit and warmed up the ship for take off

Kara glances to the door at the feeling of engines warming up. She sighs softly, sad to see some of her friends staying behind to fight. Still, she was needed and would take their good times together to heart in her memory. She picks up another tool and begins to wash and steralize it, going slow for once to make them shine again.

Scratching his head at the Captain's reply as he walks away to the cockpit, Proboss turns around slowly looking at the lounge, trying to remember what he could about Dynamic class frigates.* *Well, and he's helpfull too…*
Proboss picks his bags up off the floor, and nods to Master Lanius. **"I will be right back. Let me go find a place to drop my stuff, and change into my traveling clothes. If you have a moment, I would like to discuss the mission parameters with you so that I can get an idea about what I can do to best serve you."**
Proboss nods again, and walks aft, back towards the entrance ramp, looking for a bunk and a refresher.

While in the process of doing your respective tasks, you hear the sound of the engines as Bendak prepares to leave. After gaining clearance to leave Bendak pilots the ship out of the Titan's Valiant and into space, then prepares to enter hyperspace. It isn't long before the stars elongate and the ship enters hyperspace.
Bendak: The journey will take 2 days.

Tonin spends is time between helping Kara and mediating on thing so far. After medating in his room he heads to the medbay to talk to Kara. When he sees her he smiles. "Good day, I was wondering if you knew what we are going to be doing this time around? I was also wondering what you thought of the addition to the crew?"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-06-16 16:28:39)

Kara turns, giving the sith a soft smile "I'm not sure to be honest of where we're going but the new crewman seems nice." She leans her back against the counter with a sigh "I..have to admit I miss the others..I know that..Jedi must keep everything in check..too much of something and we fall. Still, since our talk I've been thinking a lot, maybe...feelings aren't as bad as they make them out to be..how can it be so bad. Granted I don't know much about them." she chuckles softly.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-06-16 17:01:25)

"Well some feeling are bad and can be powerful such as anger. It can make you quite powerful. Some are not so bad." He looks at Kara to see if she understands. "The Sith teach that if you use your emotions and passions it will set you free. I have done some imposable things when I have needed to. I have also done some stuff that I am now not proud of." "I will try to make up for those things if I can." Tonin looks away from Kara as if he is ashamed of telling her about himself and what he has learned as a Sith.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-06-16 17:14:05)

Kara hums softly "free...interesting.." she smiles at him, stepping up to him and moving so she could catch his eye again "You've made up for a lot things already Tonin."

"Your Masters would not see it that way." "They would strike me down instead of try to redeem me, and they maybe correct in there thinkingwith everything that has happened lately." Tonin looks at her and trys to reassure himself that she is right and he is coming back to the light. " With your help I am sure I can become a better person." "Anyway I was wondering if you could help me with something else? I waswondering if you could help melearn to use the force better then I can?"

Clanking boots echo around the corner as Proboss comes into the Lounge area, dressed in a flight suit with his helmet under his arm. He is sporting a blaster pistol slung over his hip, a utility belt, and bandoleer. He also seems to have a carbine combat slung under his armpit for easy reach. *Hmm…I hope Master Lanius will have a moment to discuss this mission…*
**"Ah, Master Lanius, I was hoping to have a moment to discuss with you what exactly were your expectations of this upcoming mission, and how best I could assist you and the crew."**
He slides onto the couch opposite Master Lanius and runs a hand over his scalp. He slips a datapad out of a pocket, and prepares himself to take some notes, scribbling something as he looks up.
**"From what you said earlier, we are going to Rhen Var, to some temple? Anything you could tell me about it from a tactical standpoint? Also, what do you expect in the way of resistance between here and there, and possibly while we are there?"**
Grinning sheepishly, Proboss chuckles a little bit.
**"Not too many questions I hope, but I always get excited being back out amongst the stars…must be the old spacehound in me."**

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-06-16 20:38:31)

Lanius smiles and looks at Proboss amused. "I have not had the pleasure of being to Rhen Var, though Kara has. It is more of a sanctuary than a temple. It is where Ulic Qel-Droma went into exile after the Great Sith War as well as where he died. The planet itself is a relative wasteland with the sanctuary underground in caves."
Lanius leans back in the lounge chair making himself as comfortable as possible.
"I am heading there to learn. It will also be a chance for Kara and her new companion, Tonin to recuperate from their hardships. Unless the other Sith sects wish to come out into the open and follow Jut-hakks path, I don't foresee any resistance."
"Is there anything else I can answer?"

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-16 22:00:42)

Tapping his stylus against the table, Proboss sighs as he scribbles a few notes.
*…Hmm, talk to Kara about this planet if possible…*
**"Well, now that we are getting down to the micrometers, I suppose I don't have too many questions more questions…I was told that I am primarily here to guard you as you deliver something to this…temple? I really don't need to know the specifics of the item in question I suppose…plausible deniability and all…but if you could endulge me for a mere moment. What is the nature of the item? Is it a weapon of some kind? Also, what is the likelyhood of bad stuff happening if this gets into the wrong hands?"**
Proboss rubs his hand over his scalp again, and looks up from his datapad at Master Lanius and grins.
**"Sith…Mandalorians…Secret Missions to deliver strange somethings to hidden Temples on deserted planets….this is turning into quite the plot for a holovid! Are all dealings with Jedi like this?"**

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-06-16 22:11:34)

Lanius frowns as he considers you. "IT is of course natural for you to be curious about the item in question. But there shouldn't be anything to worry about. Thanks to the efforts of Kara and her companions the item has been rendered inert. Only a very powerful Force user could revive it. It is doubtful such a presence could be hidden from Kara, Tonin or myself."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-06-19 02:06:01)

Tonin looks down alittle embarist. "I can't use the Froce to move things or see the future, most, well actually all of my talent lays in the use of a lightsaber." "I never really good at the other stuff. But I excell at combat." Tonin hopes that she will not find to much fault in this. But he did ask for her help.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-06-19 02:12:03)

Kara hums softly "everyone has a skill they excel at with the force. I'm not very good with a lightsaber, only enough to defend myself and my patient until help arives." She turns her head and raises her hand, one of her tools moving to her hand "But I can move objects very well. I..can't help much with combat..but I can help you learn more with moving things."

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-06-19 02:24:45)

"It would be an honor to have you as a teacher Kara." Tonin smiles at the relief of expecting his lack of Force talent. "I could help you with your lightsaber form, cause I would hate for anything to happen to you my dear."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-06-19 10:03:24)

Kara smiles and chuckles softly as she takes a seat on one of the beds, patting the seat beside her "I would love to learn whatever you could teach me, though I doubt anything would happen to me with you around." a faint tint of red adorned her cheeks after her words.

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-06-19 15:10:54)

"Well I cannot be around all the time, even if I so desired." Tonin takes a seat next to Kara. "So you will teach me how to use the force and I will teach you how use a lightsaber." Tonin finds himself alittle uncomfortable around Kara, but he can think of no toher place he would rather be. "So when would you like to start?"

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-06-19 15:32:01)

Kara nods her head, training him and he training her would allow them more time spent together. She smiles at him, her voice calm and soft "Close your eyes, the best way to start is always back at the beginning, to move into a meditative state, it's there we hear the forces call. The Force is in us all, for some it's heard stronger than others but it's always there. Try and hear it, feel it, that power that's deep inside that gives wisdom and advice when you've needed them.."

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **ganthet** (2008-06-19 15:37:20)

"I will try." Tonin says and closes his eyes consenrating on the Force and Karas vocie. He understands that if he wants to become better he has to start over at the begining.

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-06-27 12:18:07)

All of you spend the 2 days of the journey in your various pursuits and you feel the slight jolt as the ship exits hypserspace. Through ports you see the ice planet of Rhen Var where Kara and her companions faced the Darks Side spirit of Saalo Morn and encountered the Force Ghost of Ulic Qel-Droma. ((That was just a little reminder for Kara since I am unsure if she remembers that encounter... As fun as it was <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->))
Lanius now fully rested looks down at the planet eagerly.

### **ganthet** (2008-06-29 01:37:46)

"So that is the place we are going? Seems kind of deselate." Tonin looks at the planet they are desending on try to see why the Jedi would have a temple here. "Well at least we will have plenty of peace and solitude while we are training." Tonin looks over at Kara and smiles.

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-29 01:54:46)

Looking out the port next to Tonin, Proboss nods his head...
**"No, no…isolated is good…hide the item, and keeps everything niiiiiice and quiet."**
He looks over at Tonin and Kara,
**"Training, hunh…so you two are jedi two then? Interesting. I am beinging to wonder just who is protecting who here…I have never had such prestigious and capable warriors around me."**
Grinning, Proboss taps the glass, and winks as he turns and meanders his way to the port dormatory to where his stuff was located.

The planet below does indeed look desolate with no signs of civilization or surface ruins. Lanius heads to the cockpit to direct Bendak to the landing site. After a few minutes he comes back out and takes a seat, preparing for the landing.

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-06-29 14:06:07)

Kara sighs over the sight of the planet "Never thought I'd be coming back here again..." At the new members words she was about to respond when he left, she sighs again and turns to Tonin with a wry smile "suppose I should mention that I'm more of a healer than a fighter?" She looks back to the view "but you are right...at least it's quiet for training."

Bendak follows Laniuss' instructions as he preps the ship for landing "OK let do this" he says as he pilots the ship down and lands right were he was told to land. He walks back to the main area and grabs two rather large, black, blaster pistols and makes sure that they are good for ammo "Ok everyone off the ship, joy ride is over" he said as he got ready to get off the ship

With the ship safely on the groud, Lanius makes his way to a cargo room to grab various supplies. He places an all temperature cloak around his shoulders and pulls out a few lanterns passing one over to Tonin and Kara. He also takes hold of climbing gear. With the dormant Force Harvester secure on his person he heads off the ship unless someone stops to talk with him.

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-07-01 02:21:04)

Kara smiles at the Sith as she takes a lantern and makes sure her cloak is tied on and wrapped around her "Come on, I'll tell you all about the adventures that went on here." With that she waits for him at the ramp before leaving after the other Jedi; her hand lightly brushing against his as they walk.

---

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-07-01 22:14:20)

Making your way off the ship, Kara easily recognizes where they are. Not far from the landing site is the cliff where Lanius prepares to set up the climbing gear he has brought with him. It's only when he stops that you notice something is wrong. Already set up are two lines heading down into the crevice.
After a few moments he sets up another set and prepares to repeal down.

"Where is your sence of adventure Kara? I sure who ever is here is friendly, hopefully." Tonin moves with Kara and the others as they make there way off the ship and into the Temple. Pulling his cloak around him to keep the cold at bay.

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-07-03 11:01:35)

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Vash** (2008-07-04 03:35:50)

Bendak looked up "And if they're not friendly I'm sure a few blaster bolts to the face will change their mind" he said with a small a laugh as he pulled out his blasters and looked around

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-07-05 00:18:07)

Now at the bottom of the ravine the door into the tomb is hard to find. Kara is the first to find it, half remembering where it was.
The door is finely cut and heavy looking. Working together you are able to move it aside. Through the door almost hidden among the features of the stone wall, a dark opening beckons. Inside, the ground lsopes sharply downward into blackness.
Shifting his bag he takes out the lantern and lights it, piercing some of the darkness. In his other hand he holds his saber at the ready.
Kara:
[hide]The tomb no longer seems permeated by the dark side. You can still sense some of the taint but it is not as strong as it was while under the influence of Saalo Morn.[/hide]

Tonin steps in front of Kara and the others walking into the tomb frist. Tkaing out his lightsaber. "Can you tell me where and how many Kara?" Tonin starts to look around to see if he can find the danger.

### **Alicia** (2008-07-05 16:04:44)

As all of you walk in the stone door closes behind you. The only source of light now comes from Lanius's lantern. Down the hall you can see another opening. Its door has already been set aside.

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-07-05 23:48:55)

Kara looks back at the sound of the door closing. She turns back to the Sith and steps up to him slightly "I don't like this..." She takes a breath and searches through the force for the others that were in the area; trying to discern who they were and where they might be.

Looking around at those gathered around him, Proboss tilts his head and raises and eyeridge.
**"Getting a bit skittish in here?"** His voice rings through the hallway, and he immediately drops into a crouch and shuts his mouth. *I must admit that it seems a bit spooky though…*
Stopping for just a moment, as if to question his own feelings about the situation, he settles into a crouched stance and raises his carbin up into a readied position, pointing roughly 45 degress ahead of him at the floor...to facilitate a quick reaction if one should be needed.
**"I'm with you guys on this one…if you are nervous, then I will do my best to trust that you are more sensitive to these kinds of things."**
He moves forward cautiously, getting into a more aggressive position near Master Lanius.
**"Perhaps it is best if I stick with you and do what I can to protect you, eh?"**
With that, he falls into position, and mimics and shadows every movement from Master Lanius, betraying his nominally militaristic past. There is a slight buzz as he purposely switches the selector switch on his carbine from safe to semi.

## Re: Another Beginning

### **Alicia** (2008-07-29 17:24:22)

Moving through the entry hall you see that the ceiling consists of half a dozen distinct square blocks of solid stones about 2 meters across, covering the length of the corridor. They are suspended from above by stout chains. Kara remembers how theses blocks had trapped them in here after opening the door in the next room leading into the Dark Hall.
Moving into the crypt the glow of the lanterns spreads out around you. This small, square chamber seems to be a crypt. A large sarcophagus, crudely carved with the image of an impressive humanoid figure, rests near the far wall, below a roughly-painted mural depicting the same figure pulling starships down from the sky. Scattered around the base of the sarcophagus are baskets of withered fruit, odd bits of metal fashioned into crude jewelry, and an old blaster pistol, its power pack long drained and dead.

## Re: Another Beginning

### **zerah** (2008-07-29 21:59:17)

Kara stares at the sarcophagus, she couldn't help the memories that surfaced from this crypt, She sighs softly "This place brings back a lot of memories..."
*Edit: took that part out about the memories that surface and saving for later =P thanks for the reminder licia.*

just a reminder Kara this is the fake crypt the sarcophagus isn't real as far as you can tell. The sarcophagus of Saalo Morn is deeper down.
here's an image. [hide]http://campaign.swrpgrc.com/images/maps/index.php?cmd=image&gallery=other/&image=crypt_40px.jpg[/hide]
Room 1 - Crypt (current location)
