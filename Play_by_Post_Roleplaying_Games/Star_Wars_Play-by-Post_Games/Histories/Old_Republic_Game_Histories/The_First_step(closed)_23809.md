# The First step(closed)

### **Avarna** (2009-03-03 23:17:24)

"The first step on any is the hardest, and the path of the Jedi is hardest of all." Jedi Master Mical spoke. Beside him stood Master Visas Marr, And Master Arissa Saur. It was one of the rare days of celebration at the Jedi Academy on Dantooine. The first class of students to be trained here since the Jedi Cival war is about to graduate. Family and friends have been invited to attend the ceremony, but only those that lived on the farming world are able to be present.
"All of you have been Guided by your instructors: You've learned to wield a lightsaber, and to feel the Force. But know that your education hasn't ended. As it says in the Jedi Code, "There is no Ignorance, there is Knowledge" And now is the time to take the first steps towards spreading knowledge. I now bestow upon you, One and all, the rank of Jedi Padawan. Tomorrow, You will receive your first assignment as Jedi."

Wess stood at attention, a broad smile on his rough features. He couldn't help but feel proud of himself, and rightly so; it was not hubris to be satisfied with one's accomplishments. He eagerly awaited his first chance to test his abilities. He hoped he didn't let everyone down.
Sneaking a glance towards his parents, he gave a little wave towards his mother.

Alyss was very eager. She had been looking forward to her future and this assignment was just the beginning. It was nice to see her family and everything but she no longer had any reservations about leaving her old life behind.
Her eyes surveyed the other youths around her. Her mouth quirked to the side as she noticed Wess being silly. They had trained so much that it was funny comparing his friendly personality to that of his serious all-business one. He was so focused on excelling that she couldn't help developing a bit of rivalry with him in their various encounters.
They were all going to do great things someday. She just knew it.

As Wenton stood listening to Master Mical speak about their futures, he noticed Wess waving at his family. He also noticed Alyss almost smirking at Wess for his silliness. While extremely happy about graduation, Wenton didn't show it on the outside. His use of the Force was limited to himself, but he could control himself. However, he certainly didn't blame Wess for his exuberance, not with his family here. Wenton reached inside his tunic and felt the cred hanging around his neck as he thought about his family, particularly his father. He knew that he wasn't the master of the force that his mother and brothers were. He certainly wasn't as good as Alyss or Marcus. Sometimes during training, Wenton felt that he was inferior to his companions. They could call upon the Force to do incredible things, while he was stuck here in the middle of combat. However, then he would remember his father, or stories of him, and the great warrior he was. Kenton Kether also couldn't use the Force to manipulate the universe around him, but on Corellia, no one thought less of him.
Letting go of of the cred, Wenton's hand fell back into place behind his back, clasping the other hand. As it did so, it brushed against his double-lightsaber. He wasn't finished mastering the difficult weapon, but one day he would become a great swordsman, like his father. He would serve the galaxy and those who live in it.
Shifting his eyeballs in their sockets so as to not move his head, Wenton also caught a glimpse of Lu'ren. The Zabrak had just recently arrived at the enclave, and so Wenton didn't know him too well. He also caught a glimpse of Marcus, standing in the back, as usual. Wenton worried about Marcus some what. He didn't make friends as easily as the others. Wenton had broached the subject a few times, but had gotten the impression that Marcus didn't want to talk about it. So, Wenton didn't press. Marcus would alk when he felt like it.
All in all, Wenton was in the company of good friends. And that, he decided, would do in the absence of his family.
All he wondered about now was what was going to be his first assignment.

Marcus Serath stood alone towards the rear of the crowd of new padawans. He couldn't understand the conflicting emotions he felt at being here, hearing this speech. One part of him, the part that had made him weary of his old master, was excited at the prospect of becoming a Jedi. Another part of him, the part that enjoyed the power that came with the Dark Side, was disgusted at the idea of being a "guardian of the peace." And try as he might, Marcus couldn't figure out which side of him was the true Marcus Serath.
Hearing the ceremony coming to a close, Marcus shook off his indecision and focused in on the last sentence the master had said. *So, we receive our first 'assignment' tomorrow,* Marcus thought. He was no stranger to danger after four years as a bounty hunter, not to mention his training in the Dark Side before that. Finally, Marcus could settle on an emotion: anticipation. Equally excited and weary for tomorrow's possibilities, Marcus resigned himself to wait until tomorrow to find out more.
Suddenly it occurred to Marcus that he barely knew the other new padawans around him. If they were assigned to a mission together, lack of familiarity could be a liability. However, if he were assigned to a master with no other students, then getting to know his fellow graduates could become a distraction, which was also a possible liability. With a sigh, Marcus realized he could never successfully strike up a conversation anyway, due to his anti-social nature and the aura of the Dark Side he unconsciously gave off at all times. Once again he found himself forced to resign himself to wait until tomorrow to learn anything more.

Lu'ren stood distanced from the other Padawns and sighed when Wess waved towards his family. Of course he didn't even know where his family were, or if they even loved him. It was a proud moment for Lu'ren but he didn't show it much. The long hyperspace journey from Coruscant had left him tired and he hadn't shaken it off yet. He looked around towards his companions, they all seemed different and he didn't know them at all. In fact the only person he knew at all was Visas, and she now stood next to the other Jedi Masters, she seemed happy.
The assignment though, the words had cast mystery and some doubt into his mind. He was slightly nervous, not out of fear of what he may face. But more out of fear that he might let the Order down.

*Late, late, late, late, late â€¦ too late! Drax!*
Liran pushed through the ring of spectators to join her fellow apprentices standing before the masters as inconspicuously as possible - and failed, of course. Ignoring the amused glances and grins she threw Arissa Saur an apologizing smile, almost able to hear her resigned sigh in the back of her head. 'Unpunctuality is more than just a sign of disrepect for the other students and your teachers - it is a deplorable habit that negatively impacts on your whole life.' *Oh, please, master. It worked for that Carrick guy, didn't it? Besides, what am I to do if the Force wills me to arrive a bit late every now and then? Especially if it hides my favourite robe and I have to wear this rag instead?!*
Looking down her perfectly fine formal Jedi robe the Zeltron wondered once again if she had accidently snatched up one of Alyss' cast-offs. It just didn't look good on her.

Marcus, seeing as the ceremony was over, turned and made for the main academy building, brushing by the tardy Zeltron on the way. *It's still too early to sleep, so I'll get some lightsaber practice in first,* Marcus decided. He made his way to the lightsaber training room and pulled a training saber and remote off a rack on the wall. He stopped and looked at the training saber in his hands. *Why use this when I could get used to the feel of my real saber again?* Marcus, using the Force, replaced the training saber on the rack.
After keying in the difficultly level he wanted, he activated the remote. Then, as it floated on its own power, he flicked on his crimson lightsaber. Then, the droid fired stun bolts at him, which he deflected with some effort.

Wenton heard the rustling at the back of the group and immediately knew that it was Liran. Who **else** would be this late to their own graduation ceremony?
At the close of the ceremony, Wenton turned to see Liran at the back of the group fussing with her robes. *Probably thinking that they're not good enough, or something.* Wenton glanced at the Zeltron and thought that she looked just as good in that robe as any other.
Noticing Marcus heading towards the main building, Wenton decided to follow him. *No one should be alone on their graduation night. Besides, someone'll need to bring him back for Liran's party. **No one** should miss that.*
Heading after Marcus, Wenton playfully bumped Liran's shoulder on the way out of the main room.
Reaching the sparring room, Wenton noticed Marcus drilling his lightsaber. Wenton kept his distance for a few minutes while the young padawan drilled. After a while, Marcus went over to the wall mounts and placed his personal saber on the stand and picked up a training double blade. He also picked up a training single blade for Marcus. Keeping a safe distance while his fellow padawan had an active, real blade, Wenton called out;
"Marcus! Do want someone to spar with? I could use some exercise myself."

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-05 19:23:55)

"â€¦Sure, these remotes get boring after a while." Marcus released the activation switch on the lightsaber in his hand, letting the crimson blade deactivate. At the same time, he dodged around a stun bolt, deactivating the droid and catching it. Once again using the Force, he placed the droid and his saber on the rack. Finally, he walked over to Wenton and accepted the training saber.
Taking a few steps back, he bowed and activated the saber. He held the blue blade in the standard Shii-Cho stance, one of the only ones he really bothered studying. "Ready when you are."

Seeing Marcus stepping into his defensive stance, Wenton ignited his blade, one side only. Wenton was training with the double blade, but he knew better than to try it out on Marcus. Being physically blind might confuse *some* people, but Wenton knew better than to underestimate Marcus. He'd seen him in combat enough times to know what the Miralukan was capable of. Instead, Wenton had another idea, Ataru. Stepping foward the last few meters to gain some speed, Wenton deactivated his saber at the last second and jumped into the air to flip over Marcus's head. His plan was to land behind Marcus and attack him with his from behind, hoping to end the match quickly with a cho mai, aiming to disable Marcus's weapon arm with the stun saber.

Wenton scored a hit to Marcus's weapon arm, but noticed that it wasn't enough to slow him down, yet. But, Wenton hoped he could keep this up to whittle the Miralukan down.

*Ataru! Trying to disorient me?* Marcus whirled around to meet his attacker. His Force Sight was not as easily confused as most people assumed, and was sometimes more effective than normal sight. But then, Wenton knew that. They had sparred before, and he was one of Marcus's favorite opponents. And while Marcus knew he was the inferior of the two in pure lightsaber combat, he also knew he was far the superior in the use of the Force.
Deciding to go for the direct approach, Marcus stepped forward, holding his lightsaber with both hands. He made a downward cut with the intention of battering his enemy's blade aside and hopefully scoring a hit as well.

During the rest of the ceremony, Wess wiped the dopey grin off his face and conducted himself as a true padawan should, at least to Wess' mind. This was an important occasion and he felt he shamed himself and his family by acting like an excited country boy.
As the ceremony came to it's end Wess headed towards his dorm, having already made a decision to meditate on his newfound achievement and see if he could find some insight within himself concerning the mission that was soon to come. Everything, no matter how small and inconsequential, seemed like a mission to Wess and he would do his best to accomplish whatever it was.
As he walked he nodded to each of the other padawans, a stern but congratulating look on his face; they should all be proud of what they accomplished today.
Alyss, such a strong grasp of the force. Wess had trouble levitating his lightsaber sometimes; Alyss had the same amount of trouble levitating a speeder.
Wenton and Marcus. Each so intense in their own ways, and each already shaping up to be deadly combatants. Wess' head hurt sometimes just watching the two go at it.
Liran...she probably wanted to have a party after the celebration. When did she *not* want to have a party? Maybe sometime he'll be able to relax long enough to go to one, but so far he hasn't been able to get rid of the feeling that he'd be wasting precious study time.
Lu'ren. Of all the padawans, Wess and Lu'ren's abilities seemed the most similar and yet Wess knew next to nothing about him; he was so reclusive and had yet to open up to anybody, as far as Wess knew. He hoped some day they would become friends, as he did with all the padawans.
And then there was himself, Wess. Try as he might, he has yet to excel at any one particular thing. He cannot even approach Alyss' skill in the use of the force, his combat skills are exceeded by Marcus and Wenton and he will never have charisma Liran possesses....he was just...Wess.
Perhaps that is what he will meditate upon tonight.

The blades crackled and popped, spreading the smell of ozone as Wenton parried Marcus's blade to the right of his body. Using the momentum created, Wenton allowed the lightsaber to continue its natural circular arc over his head as he dropped down into a low stance and swung for Marcus's legs, this time going for the cho mok maneuver.
(Attack: 12+2=14)
(Damage: [2+2+2]/2=3 points hp damage)
Managing to connect to some small extent with Marcus's legs, Wenton decided to not risk Marcus coming down with an overhead strike and used the momentum of his squatting combined with that of his rotating arm to cartwheel away from Marcus and get out of reach before coming back to him again.
(Acrobatics check: 14+8=22)
Rising to his feet again, Wenton quickly moved to a safer distance from the force powerful Miralukan.
*He can't get me if he can't reach me.* Wenton thought.

Marcus growled. He hadn't taken any serious damage yet, but he had been tagged twice. That made him angry. He stretched his arm out, calling on the Force. "Graaaaaaaaah!" He trust his arm forward, grabbing Wenton with the Force and throwing him across the room, into the far wall. "Hah!" Marcus bent over, catching his breathe after throwing Wenton. Then he straightened up, cracking his neck and smirking.

"Unfff" was all Wenton managed to get out as Marcus grabbed him in a Force grip and threw him across the room. Wenton felt his muscles scream in pain as the hard, unyielding stone met his fairly unprotected backside. He was also fairly certain he'd felt some bones injure as well.
Landing on the ground, Wenton barely managed to keep his balance. Then he noticed something.
*That **really** took it out of him. Time to move in for the finishing blow.* Wenton **really** hoped that Marcus didn't have another one of those tricks up his sleeve as charged the Miralukan, blade getting ready to swing for Marcus's mid section in a sai tok. Normally, the sai tok was frowned upon by the masters as it would, if successful, cut an opponent in two at the waist. *But*, Wenton thought, *these are sparring sabers. It won't kill him, but it might take the wind out of him.*

*Sithspit!* Marcus lept back, desperately trying to avoid the dangerous attack. Somehow, he made it in time to avoid much more than a scratch. Breathing hard from the effort of moving that quickly, Marcus knew this fight had to end quick, or Wenton's superior saber skills would turn the tables again. Marcus raised his blade overhead, gripping it tightly with both hands. He stepped into the blow, adding all of his strength to his attack, which he aimed to be a Sai-Cha, a decapitating blow. Or rather, it would have been if he was using a real saber and if he had not missed Wenton's neck entirely, instead hitting his shoulder.

Knowing that he was losing this fight, thanks to Marcus's propensity for the Force, Wenton realized that he couldn't just keep swinging away at Marcus, hoping for the best. He had to fight smarter, not harder. Taking a second to catch his breath, Marcus felt much better and more energized. Then, focusing all of his acrobatic training, as well as the Force through his movements, Marcus moved into the Soresu style of combat. Pure defense. He wouldn't attack until the Force told him he was ready to get back into it. Melding into the force, Marcus became the embodiment of *untouchable*.

"â€¦Soresu, eh? Good strategy, and an excellent style. I'm certainly impressed, as always, Wenton," Marcus said in a calm, complementing tone. Inwardly, though, he was mad. Very, very mad. *There's no way I can get past that defense easily.* Marcus thought for a minute, deciding how to attack. Then he smirked. *Juyo.* He pulled back three meters, preparing to charge. "Brace yourself," he muttered. Then, he took off, bringing his full momentum to bear with both his hands on the hilt. "Yaaaaaah!"

Wenton staggered under Marcus's **powerful** attack.
***FRACK***, he thought. *I didn't think he was **that** good.*
However, Marcus's charge attack had given Wenton the amount of time he needed to do something extraordinary. He'd caught his breath. He'd also decided that it was time to show his full potential. Squatting just enough to get the momentum going, Wenton jumped backward, rolling mid air to avoid any surprise attacks made by Marcus. Landing on his feet, he faced Marcus and a grin spread over his face.
*This might be the end of the duel for me, but it's the only way I can win this. Besides, I need the practice anyway.*
Spinning the training saber over his head for a bit of flourish, Wenton activated the saber's full potential. A second blue blade emitted from the opposite end of the saber, making it a true light-staff.
"Alright, Marcus! Let's do this!" The grin spreads even further as Wenton gets ready to spar with a person he hopes will become his friend, if not a long-term sparring partner.

Suddenly, the training lightsaber left Weston's hand, and flies into the hand of Master Arrisa Saur. Her expression is stern, as she steps forward. Moments latter, the same fate falls upon Marcus's saber.
"A good display of swordsmanship. But you need to be mindful of your feelings Marcus, anger leads to the dark side. And you don't need another lecture on that." She then places one of the practice sabers on the rack. "So would you like to try sparing with me?"

Marcus grunted in anger and surprise as Wenton evaded his follow-up attack. Then he acknowledge the Jedi Master entering the room. "Master Saur." His anger had gotten the best of him? True, it had. Marcus would have to reflect on this. In the meantime, Marcus was curious about the Master's offer of a sparring match. "Sounds interesting. Is the offer for me or Wenton?"

Wenton is shocked by the sight of his saber flying, deactivating mid air, out of his hands.
*I didn't think Marcus had **that** kind of control over the Force.*
His shock was replaced by a degree of guilt when he saw where the saber landed. In the hand of Master Saur. And she did not look happy. Wenton had known that there were rules to practice duels, and maybe they'd broken some out of carelessness. Hearing Master Saur's comments towards Marcus, Wenton thought it impolite to hear his comrade getting dressed down like this. He bowed at the waist towards Master Saur and then towards Marcus and backed out of the sparring ring, turning only when he reached the defined edge of the ring (not like it had been the limits of their duel, though). Reaching the edge of the room, Wenton knelt down in a meditative position and awaited whatever punishment Master Saur had in mind for him while he pondered the previous fight.
His meditations lead him to realize that he **had** let his need for competition get the best of him. He had let the fight continue longer than it should have, and not for the sake of practice, but for the sake of beating Marcus. He had let himself be driven by aggression. And aggression, he knew, was the path to the dark side.
The shame of this realization burned inside of him and he knew he would have to apologize to both Master Saur and Marcus before he left the room.
Wenton perked up his ears at Marcus's suggestion of sparring with Master Saur. He knew that neither one of them would stand a chance alone. But, if they worked together...
***NO!*** Wenton shouted to himself. *I will **NOT** be pulled in by the thought of aggression and glory again. If Master Saur wants to spare with either me, Marcus, or both, I will only do it to learn from her. I will do it to become a better Jedi. Nothing more.*

"One, Either, or Both." Arrisa replied. She looked over to where Wenton knelt, apparently meditating on fight. As the Master stepped into the circle she let her outer robes drop to the floor. "Of course, I'll understand if you feel a greater need to prepare for Tomorrow."

Wenton heard Master Saur's reply about sparring. Not looking up from his meditative stance, he searched his feelings.
*Am I prepared to fight and not be pulled in by aggression? Especially with my colleagues and masters? Can I enter this fight untainted by the previous one? Or, should I just back down and humbly concede my earlier foolishness?*
Wenton waited for a moment to see what the Force told him.

Alyss departed as well, seeking out her family for hugs. She smiled somewhat shyly at her accomplishment and shared the warm feelings she had with them.
As she walked away with her family, listening to them chat about her future grand adventures, Alyss caught Wess' eye and gave a little wave. She meant it as a playful tease about the wave to his family.
She smiled to any other padawans that looked her way and watched to see where some of the most promising students disappeared to.

Lu'ren noticed as Wenton and Marcus left, and also another padawan's particular interest in Liran. She was certainly different, so charismatic she could probably talk a Rancor out of a fight and teach it to fetch. Ally was certainly the most intriguing to him, she couldn't speak but her ability to manipualte the force was almost mystical compared to his own. He was interested in Wenton and Marcus right now however, he saw them head to the sparring room and felt it could be a good oppertunity to witness them in combat, it could prove useful in the long run.
He arrived to see Master Saur and the two students in the room. For now he decided to lean against the wall and see what would happen, he did hope to get some training in before the next morning though.

Having confirmed through the Force that this would an excellent learning experience, and that he **could** control his aggression or at least Master Saur would help him control it, Wenton decided to enter the sparring ring with Master Saur and Marcus.
*We might **lose**, but we will learn.*
Bowing deeply at the waist as he enters the ring and again as he accepts the training saber from Master Saur, Wenton positions himself on the opposite side of Saur from Marcus. Breathing deeply, Wenton calms himself and sets himself in a standard Niman stance for optimum defense. He didn't know yet how they were going to fight her, but he didn't want to use an Ataru move and land right in front of Marcus's blade, stun or not. With a flick of his thumb, Wenton ignited one side of the blue saber in his hand.

Lu'ren now realises what's about to happen, sparring with a Jedi master, even with two other students would be a great oppertunity so he takes a blue, singlebladed training sabre, "Mind if I.. Help?" he said towards Wenton and Marcus. He ignited the lightsaber, the blade pointing behind him. He'd only ever sparred with Visas until now, and he always knew she wouldn't use her full strength against him, this seemed like more of a challenge.

Marcus smiled with anticipation. Now THIS was more like it! What better way to learn to work with someone than fighting alongside them? And against a Jedi Master no less. He ignited his lightsaber without any hesitation. "All right then. May the Force be with all of us." He held his arms over his head, both hands on the saber, and bent his elbows, resulting in his lightsaber being behind him. He had chosen Djem So, a form he had little practice in, but seemed appropriate for this battle.

Lu'ren nods as he sees the others take up their stances and does the same himself, he bends his knees a little, likely in preperation for some sort of acrobatic leap, and tightens his grip on the training lightsaber. The blade is now pointed towards the ground before him.

Master Saur looked over the students, and fell into the opening stance of Makashi. However, effortlessly, she blocks Lu'ren's attack, even as she dashes forwards towards Marcus. Her strike slips past his defenses easily, to leave a backhanded strike against his bottom. But its clear she could have put more force behind the blow. As with Lu'ren's attack, the Jedi Master easily blocks Marcus's attempt to counter attack. She takes three more steps before turning around to look at her students once again.
(Marcus take 6 stun. She's being nice and not applying her bonus to damage)

"Gah!" Marcus snarled as the training saber gave him a good jolt. *Incredible. She's fast! And she was holding back on that attack? This is a true Jedi Master, after all!* Marcus, realizing Djem So had completely failed him, shifted once again into the stronger, more aggressive Juyo style. *Ok, control. You can do this. Aggression feeds on fear. From fear comes anger. And from anger, the path to the Dark Side. Clear your mind of fear, and you remove your anger.* Marcus took a deep breath, calming himself. He then takes a flying leap back, landing only a few meters away. Then, he charges, swinging his saber with both hands.

After a moment of thought, Lu'ren changes his stance, reversing his grip on the lightsaber so the blade is behind him. He charges towards Saur again, before falling into a forward roll and attempting to strike her from behind.

After meditating for a while (nothing important, just clearing his head) Wess soon walked into the training room, origionaly intending to go through his forms. When he was alone he liked to do all the various lightsaber moves very slowly and surely, believing that it will improve his technique by teaching his body how to move.
What he found was a battle betwix three of his comrades and a Jedi Master.

*How typical! I get here and the party stops .. well, Jedi party, that is. But now it's time for a real party!!!* Liran thought as she homed in on her target. Unfortunately, Wenton's playful bump sent her off-path and she couldn't help stumbling against another student. *You are on the list, Wenton!* she glared after him in mock anger. Not that the guy complained - this was one advantage of being a Zeltron: nobody ever complained if you bumped into them.
Re-acquiring the objective Liran threw her arm around Alyss' shoulders and cooed "**Just the girl I was looking for."** She favoured the poor girl's family surrounding them with a dazzling smile and a conspiratorial wink. **"You'll have to pardon us for a moment but there's some important Jedi business I really need the number one student for. Don't worry, though, I'll return her as soon as possible. Promise."**
Sweeping Alyss away from her family Liran whispers **"Nice save, wasn't it? Anyway, all the boys have gone off to hop around and play with their lightsabers, so it is up to us girls to organize the party. And what a party that will be! â€¦ But first we need to sneak off the Enclave grounds and get the band in."**

Noting that Lu'ren had entered the fray, Wenton became happy that he'd have the chance to see the Zabrak in action. He noticed that the others seemed to have Master Saur distracted for a moment. Wenton decided to make his move. He ran in right behind Marcus, using his charge attack as a cover, and Lu'ren's attack as a diversion, Wenton rolled to the side along the ground from behind Marcus, coming to a crouching posture for a cho mok to cut off Master Saur's legs. He figured that Saur would notice him going for her feet and react, hopefully creating the distraction that Marcus needed to get through her defenses.

Even as Wenton attempts to flake the Jedi Master, he fails to tumble past her. Master Arrisa seizes the opening and reaches out with a kick to force him to keep his distance. Then as Lu'ren and Marcus seek to press they're advantage, But Arrisa blocks both they're attacks with her lightsaber.
"Well, Done." She compliments the students, as they manage to surround her on three sides. But she then changes her stance, Quick on her feet, she tumbles away from the trio of students, and even as they attempt to strike she's no longer there. Spinning around, she strikes Wenton once again, and again is a good three meters from the students. Its clear that she's an Ataru Master.

(hp 1/31)
Tripping over his feat as he tries to roll closer to Saur, Wenton catches a full foot in his rib cage. He thinks he heard ribs crack. He knows it didn't feel that good. As if to add insult to injury, the next thing Wenton's aware of is the burning numbness of a training saber cutting right through him. Collapsing to the floor from the double attack by Master Saur, Wenton wheezes as he tries to catch his breath. He can't feel his arms, though, nor his legs. All he feels is a burning numbness creeping over his body. He manages to stand up and walk towards the edge of the ring, stumbling the entire way. He makes it to the saber table, replacing the weapon, before collapsing to the floor again. Rolling over onto his knees, Wenton catches his breath and enter a meditative state. He hopes that Master Saur, Marcus, and Lu'ren forgive him for his weakness. But, he **did** learn something from this encounter, he's no Jedi yet.

Lu'ren glances over his shoulder as Wenton stumbles away from the ring. Instead of disheartening him It made him more determined, he felt certain that it was possible to break through Master Saur's defence. He now runs towards her before leaping into the air, attempting to land just in front of her. He tries to follow through with a hard downward strike. If he couldn't even hit an opponent in a sparring session then he could never serve the Order well enough...

"Fierfek!" Marcus glared at Wenton a moment, angry at him for giving up. Then, he noticed his injuries and softened his expression. He gave Wenton what he hoped was a reassuring smile, and then leaped back into action. He whirled his lightsaber around, aiming not for Master Saur, but her lightsaber, in a Sun Djem maneuver.

Block, Block. Arrisa Saur appeared to have no problems intercepting the strikes with her own lightsaber.

Lu'ren stumbled forward as the saber smacked him in the back. The attack knocked the air from his lungs and left him gasping for a few moments. It all seemed pretty pointless now. He deactivated his saber and left the sparring room somewhat frustrated, he needed some fresh air and so headed outside.
The sky was different here, it wasn't bustling with speeders and spacecraft, it was quiet... Serene. It was the same on the planet's surface itself, instead of gilltering spires and dingy nightclubs there were just a few scattered settlements and alot of hills.
He wondered where the Girl's had gotten to, he could have sworn he heard mention of a party earlier on.

## Re: The First step...

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-06 19:53:29)

It was over, just like that. Marcus wasn't stupid enough to try and fight alone. He deactivated his training saber, and bowed to Master Saur. "Thank you for the match, Master. It was mostâ€¦instructive." Then, he walked over to Wenton, and repeated his bow. "And thank you, Wenton. I hope to duel with you again sometime." With that, Marcus turned towards the rack, where he placed the training saber and retrieved his real lightsaber. He stopped in the doorway to give one last bow to both Master Saur and Wenton, and then walked outside.

Wess stepped aside to let the two other padawans pass as they left the training area. With a respectful bow to both Master Saur and Wenton, he entered, making his way towards the winded padawan.
He intended to say something, but saw that he was meditating and decided not to disturb him. Oh well, might as well begin what he originally came here to do.
Activating his yellow lightsaber, Wess began the opening movements of Shii-Cho, performing the various katas in slow, fluid motions. As he progressed he began to work faster and faster until he was moving at full speed.
Afterwards, feeling properly warmed up, Wess began to repeat the process with his favored style; Juyo. Wess had yet to actually implement Juyo in any of his sparring matches, afraid that he had yet to achieve the necessary control required to utilize the difficult art. The pain of losing his brother, and the drive that the tragedy birthed in him to succeed constantly threatened to bubble to the surface. Juyo, for Wess, was at once a focus exercise and an outlet for his pain. The high impacting and furious strikes helped him sort out his own aggression issues, and the mental discipline the style required helped train him to deal with his anger and pain.
Idly, as he practiced, he wondered if the other padawans would be in fit condition for the mission tomorrow; they looked like they received quite the whopping.

## Re: The First step...

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-06 21:52:18)

Marcus stopped as he noted Wess entering the lightsaber training room. He turned to watch him for a moment, and was surprised to notice him practicing Juyo! Marcus had never seen Wess use Juyo, and never imagined that such a quiet student would use such a comparatively violent form. Intrigued, Marcus returned to the room. Keeping a safe distance, Marcus bowed to Wess. "Sorry to interrupt, but is that Juyo? When did you start using Juyo?"

---

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-06 22:46:44)

Wess shrugged stiffly, a little put off that he was being interrupted in the middle of his training. He continued his movements as he spoke, trying to concentrate on what he was doing. His answer was short.
"Soon after I first started...I...nevermind"
He didn't sound angry, he just sounded distracted. This was Wess' biggest personality flaw; he took his training too seriously sometimes, and felt like he was failing if he stopped for even a second.

---

## Re: The First step...

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-06 22:51:52)

Marcus was more intrigued than annoyed at Wess's short answer. "Juyo is a very aggressive form. I use it to channel my Dark Side urges into a more constructive end. In fact, that's pretty much the only reason to use Juyo." It was a comment. But it implied a question. Why are you using Juyo? What's your hidden aggression? Marcus didn't want to ask out loud in case Wess didn't want to answer, but he was curious.

---

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-06 23:08:56)

"Interesting."
Wess spun around, reaching a point in his kata where he delivered a flurry of bold, direct slashes. He felt that the most practical aspect of Juyo was being unpredictable, almost random in the attacks. This put on opponent of the defensive, which gives the attacker even *more* time to attack.
he continued, wondering how long Marcus would stay there.

---

## Re: The First step...

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-06 23:14:15)

Marcus nodded, both acknowledging that Wess did not intend to tell Marcus what he wanted to know, and Marcus also meant it as a congratulations on a perfect Juyo form. "Well, keep up the good work, your form is excellent." As anyone who spent any time around Marcus knew, when Marcus gave a complement, you could take it to heart. With that, Marcus decided to leave Wess to his training, and once again walked outside the training room into the cool, clean air of Dantooine.

---

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-06 23:30:48)

Wess nodded as Marcus left, absorbing the compliment into his subconsciousness to be reviewed at a later date. He understood that Marcus was just trying to get closer to him, and being a swordsmen probably felt that during form practice it was a good time. However, Wess also understood that if he let up on his training, even for a little bit, it would stifle his potential and might even give birth to a habit of laziness...at least in Wess' own mind it might.
He just couldn't afford that; he needed to be better.
As he finished up his katas, his thoughts drifted back to their 'conversation' and Wess hoped he hadn't offended Marcus. Alyss and the other padawans that were native to Dantooine knew how Wess got sometimes when he was busy.
He sighed to himself and began to walk to his dorm. Maybe, instead of trancing for four hours he would just get some regular sleep. It had been weeks since his last nightmare, after all.

---

## Re: The First step...

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-06 23:52:42)

As Marcus reflected on Wess's use of Juyo, his thoughts turned towards his own use of Juyo earlier. He remembered allowing his anger to get the best of him, and upon further reflection, it really wasn't for any good reason. Marcus found himself more than a little annoyed at the idea that he had so easily slipped into his old way of doing things over a simple sparring match. He decided he needed further reflection on his actions, and headed to his room, where he would meditate on his behavior.

"Tired. *But of course* â€¦" Liran grinned while playfully tightening her grip around Alyss' shoulders. "Alyss, my girl, over the past few years since I came to Dantooine I think I heard the whole plethora of possible excuses from you: 'I am tired.' 'I have a headache.' 'I'm presently levitating a really heavy landspeader over my head.' and I did let you get away with that most of the time." Shifting a bit under Alyss' reproving glare, she corrected herself. "Well, sometimes â€¦ okay-okay, once or twice. But this is totally different - how often do you think you'll graduate again? Ha, got you!"
"Anyway, to get the band in we have to get rid of that annoying protocol droid guarding the entrance and I thought maybe you could bounce him around a bit â€¦ " she added teasingly, well aware of Alyss' stance on such frivolous use of the force ... and the counterfeit passes she had created earlier on, just for this occasion.

(hp 2/31)
After an hour of meditation, Wenton got up from his position, rather stiffly, and retrieved his double saber from the table he'd left it on before the sparring match and clipped it to his belt. He felt no shame in being beaten to near unconsciousness, he had learned that he needed to know his limits and continue training to surpass them.
Turning with a limp in his step, he saw Wess practicing his forms.
*Well, I know better than to mess with Wess during his practice time. Especially since I can barely defend my self right now. One more blow and I think I'd end up in the infirmary.*
At the thought of the infirmary, Wenton realized that he probably needed to head there anyway. There was a mission tomorrow, not to mention a party tonight, and he wasn't ready for any of it. Wenton stumbled out of the training hall and headed towards the medical building. It wasn't uncommon for trainees to need attention after sessions and sparring matches, he just hoped they'd be open on graduation day.

Alyss sighed as Liran talked. She *always* could out-talk Alyss. Obviously.

Lu'ren decided to head back inside, maybe Visas could tell him a thing or two about resisting force attacks. He always felt that there wouldn't be any need but.. Well things seemed different now, even the Temple seemed more forboding than it used to.
As he walks through the door he sees Liran talking to Alyss, and the latter didn't seem to be appreciating it. He took a few steps before them, not so secretly trying to find out what they were discussing.

"Alyss, hun, don't tell me you have never heard of 'It's better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.'," Liran chattered happily, only to fall silent for a (tiny) moment and adopt a thoughtful expression. "Truth be told, though, I never do either â€¦ Anyway, let *me* tell *you* some simple facts of life: One, today we graduated. Two, there will be a party tonight. But if it makes you feel any better, I could always do a 'I have foreseen it.' in a spooky voice.

Having raised her voice from a whisper to just the point where she was sure Lu'ren could clearly hear her, Liran prepared to draw another one of her fellow students into her web. Turning and grinning broadly she said "Lu'ren, my Zabrak buddy, you are just what I need. I hereby charge you to defend the punch-bowl with your life."

"Be still my heart," Liran gasped dramatically while clasping a hand to her chest. (Never letting go of Alyss, though, because she knows that the mute girl is an elusive one.) "Surely you didn't mean to insinuate that there's anything but regular, fine, barely intoxicating punch served at my parties. I'm a responsible host, of course. And Jedi. Jedi-host?

Rather effortlessly Liran adopted Master Saur's admonishing tone. "Only the Sith deal in absolutes â€¦ and exotic punch. Beware the dark side of the punch, my student, and do not let corrupt you, lest you provide amusement to the whole party by dancing badly on the tables." 
â€¦
"Anyway, someone has to protect the punch bowl from 'undue interference' and it can't be me 'lest I not dance on the tables'. Thus the honor falls on your shoulders â€¦ unless you rather want to guard the band? I could always re-assign Wess to bowl duty. OH, PLEASE!"

I just won't do a very good job at it..."

Liran nearly groaned. Obviously she still had a lot of work to do with properly 'educating' Lu'ren in *The Way of the Party*.
"Of course not, Lu'ren. Nobody comes to a party and wants 'pure' punch. What *I* want is: No amateurish meddling with *my* punch â€¦ or rather, the special punch *I* organized for this party if you like that better. And believe me you *are* going to like it."

It looked like tonight would at least get slightly interesting. Not as Interesting as Lower city coruscant with Gang wars and Spice busts but interesting nonetheless. But then Liran knew just how exciting those could be, back when they had known each other at the Coruscant temple.

Wenton had a spring in his step now that he was out of the medical wing. He knew he needed to practice, but he had a feeling that he should be headed in another direction.
After a few minutes of walking around and admiring the night light, he noticed Liran, Lu'ren, and Alyss talking. Well, Lu'ren and Liran were talking. Alyss looked like she wanted out of there. Deciding to intervene, Wenton strolled casually up to the group.
"Well, well, well, Liran. Up to not good I take it? So, what's the plan for tonight? And, of equal importance, how are you keeping the masters away from it all?"

While Liran and Lu'ren flirted-and dragged Alyss along-she continually looked this way and that for a way out. Her pale blue eyes sought objects to tumble to make a disturbance. A bathroom to dart into, feigning sickness. A person to-Oh! Wenton.
Alyss heard his simple question clearly and quickly lowered her head to conceal a grateful smile. Instead she used the force to let him feel her gratitude for his interjection and replied: **Yes!**

Hearing the resounding answer from Alyss, Wenton moves in between her and Liran, hooking his arms into the arms of each girl at his side.
"Now, Liran. If this is like any of your other numerous escapades over the years, you've undoubtedly already given Alyss her job. You're just holding her back from doing it now that you're flirting with Lu'ren over there. Tell you what. I'll take Alyss here and we'll get started on her part while the two of you decide on how to better anger the masters with this little soiree. Okay? Okay."
Not waiting for an answer or even an acknowledgment, Wenton disengages his arm from Liran's and walks Alyss towards the door.
*Just keep walking.*
He's barely able to get the message out that he did, hoping that Alyss got it, or at least realizes what he's doing and goes along as they make a break for it, trying to escape the Zeltron's machinations for a few moments at least. Because, let's be realistic, they both know there's no where on Dantooine they could hide where they could be safe from Liran forever. Probably nowhere in the galaxy for that matter.

" 'Tis a matter of great importance, indeed. After careful deliberation," Liran explained in all seriousness, blissfully ignoring the sniggering around her, "I have come to conclusion that there two possible approaches. The first involves a complicated process for asking the masters for permission by carefully singling each one out and backing them into a corner with veiled hints of what the other masters have already acceded. The second option is even more challenging as everything hinges on one brave man sacrificing everything to run interference for his fellow students. Let's call him the dummy decoy.
And that's why I am happy to say: 'Hello, Wenton! It's *so* nice to see you, too!' "
Liran's grin nearly reached her ears.

"How are you getting it in then?" He asked, "Mical's been watching the door since the ceremony ended... He definately knows your up to something. It wouldn't surprise me if Visas was on the case too, especially after that perculiar incident in the Lower city..." Lu'ren stopped for a moment and glanced at Mical, "I don't suppose someone with your... insider knowledge would know what we're being sent to do tomorrow?"

Hearing Liran's comments still directed at him, he gave Alyss a gentle push in the back before turning back towards the Zeltronian conspirator.
*Keep going, Alyss*
"I caught that comment about a 'dummy decoy'. Indeed, one would have to be a dummy to try and distract the masters."
Seeing the look in Liran's face, Wenton knew he would lose this argument.
"Fine! What do you need, and for how long? Are we talking about distracting them for a few minutes, or for the whole night, making me the one left out of the party?"

Slowly, and gracefully Visas approaches the plotting students. If the Masters had any indication of the impending violation of peace and serenity they hadn't made any obvious signs of it. Still in her maroon robes and a hood covering half her face, the Mirikula Jedi looked first at Wenton and Alyss, then Lu'ren and finally Liran.
"Liran, Good, I have some training for you." Visas replies, in one hand she's carrying what appears to be an empty bottle. "I don't think you've done the Oxygen Bottle exercise in the past."
Visas then goes on to explain the exercise. It started by taking the bottle the Jedi Master carries, removing all the air from inside it, using the Force. After that, you only allowed the Oxygen molecules to enter the bottle, until it was full. "If done properly, You should finish in twelve hours. So if you start immediately, you should just have enough time to finish before receiving your assignment in the morning."

Hearing Master Visas's lesson for Liran, and realizing that she would never be able to host her party, Wenton considered letting it happen. It was certainly something the young Jedi needed to do to practice her use of the Force. Wenton considered sending Liran a telepathic *ha ha*, but then worried that Visas would overhear it. Instead, he decided to ask a question that he'd wondered about for awhile anyway.
"Master," he said as he bowed to Visas. "Could you give us some sort of detail as to what the mission is? We could be much better prepared for said mission if we knew what to prepare for. Also, what gear should we pack? Will our normal utility belts do, or do we need more specialized equipment? Is the mission here on Dantooine, or somewhere else. And, if of world, how far will we be traveling? Will we have space in the shuttle for practice so we dont' get out of shape. I have these questions and more, if you're willing to spend some time."
These were all questions that Wenton had anyway, but he still hoped that Master Visas didn't notice his other intention; to give Liran the out she needed.

## Re: The First step...

### **Avarna** (2009-03-08 14:34:10)

Visas turned to adress Wenton, and listened to his questions with her infinite patience. "What you need will be provided on your arrival. Master Saur has offered to transport you to Courasant aboard her transport. And I believe Rest would be the best preparation for the coming challenge."

Lu'ren smiled inside when he heard the mention of Coruscant, so much that he completely missed the meniton of a challenge. It looked like he might get to visit the Temple soon. He always felt more comfortable in the city, you could lose yourself and no-one would care. The crime served as a source of adventure too, either commiting them or trying to stop them. Lu'ren prefered the latter but it wouldn't surprise him if Liran somehow convinced him into doing the former.

Alyss hurried a few steps away, taking a corner and then peering around it at the others. Suddenly she was reminded of her brothers and sisters. This was just all one big game, the plotting, playing..the silly talk. She grinned. And here she was hiding from one of the children's plots sure to get them into trouble...Oh, and here came the stern mommy to-oops.
Alyss stepped back around the corner and bowed slightly to Visas.
*Sleep! Yes, such a good plan..*, she thought wistfully. She couldn't help wondering if any of them would get any sleep at all tonight. Maybe Wess and Marcus who were lucky enough to escape to their rooms earlier!
Excitement also entered Alyss' feelings. So they were going off planet finally. Her first time leaving her home..

Wenton bowed his head in silent acknowledgment of Master Visas's wisdom.
"Yes, Master, of course. I'll get to my room as quickly as possible and prepare for the morning."
*Sorry, Liran.*
Wenton hoped that Liran would take the point and go to bed. For now at least. Now would not be a good time with the masters watching their every move.

Shaking in obvious mock exasperation, Liran answered patiently.
"Lu'ren, my friend, the masters are *all* on my case. Even if they had never heard anything about my Coruscant doings, they'd still know that there will be a party tonight. Because I am here tonight. Really, if you play this game it would be a cardinal sin to underestimate the opposition.
Anyway, no news, no tidbits, no rumours, nothing on this mission. Which can mean two things: One, the Masters planned this alone because it is important. Two, they managed to compromise all of my channels at once without me hearing anything. Though within the realm of possibility, I have consider that highly unlikely since I always account for counter-moves. Redundancy has its uses.
Anyway â€¦"

Though the arrival of Master Visas cut her reply to Wenton short, Liran still kept her 'game-face' on. After all, her intervention meant nothing but a temporary reprieve ...
"Just with the force?" Liran asked with wide eyes. "That's hard. Really hard.
But I can still do it, of course. Don't even need the force for it, at least not Jedi force. I'm pretty sure *Zeltron force* will do quite nicely. Anyway, did you ever work with the Coruscant Police Force, Master Visas? I did and it was quite an enlightening experience. Have you ever considered the implications of a force-powered criminal, Jedi-trained or otherwise? Such a man, or woman if you want, would be a star in his line of work - the force doesn't leave mundane traces and it's use has no identifying markers even to a trained mind. Two different force-users who do the same thing leave exactly the same traces in the force. Mind-boggling, isn't it?" she went on mildly.

Lu'ren was now slightly dissapointed and also realised he'd have to go through another tedious hyperspace journey. He loved flying but hated the boring bits in between, sitting on a bunk or chair counting the revolutions of the air condiitioning, he wasn't looking forward to it. That was tomorrow though and surely he could get some proper supplies to help make the journey less boring.
*Saur certainly won't pack any interesting supplies for us* 
He was about to open his mouth to reply to Liran when he realised, she really was a bad influence...
"You can't let it go to waste..." He trailed off.

Alyss didn't know if she could watch this anymore. She bowed again and turned, hurrying down the corridors of their dorms, searching for her room.
Maybe she could escape this crazy mess and tomorrow would come soon.
She smiled though, as she jogged down the hallway.
*Oh Liran..*
She shook her head.

"Of course it is difficult, If it was easy it wouldn't be a proper exercise." Visas replied, placing the bottle in Liran's hand. "And don't try to change the subject. The Oxygen Bottle exercise is to help you learn patience, as well as your ability to focus. Both are traits you still need much practice in.
"And should you fail to complete it, Arrisa has agreed to help you on the trip to Courasant." This was a veiled way of saying, "If you don't get it done by morning, you'll be doing it every day for a week."

Wess paced in his dorm, his nose stuck in a slate he'd downloaded from his datapad. It was the complete works of Tark Main, the author of *The Adventures of Ruck Tinn* series. He'd always loved them as a child, and he often read them (over and over again) when he had trouble sleeping.
Like tonight.
Just when he was thinking about possibly trying to go back to bed, he heard hurried footsteps outside in the hallway. Was something amiss?
He poked his head outside to see Alyss blur past, still holding the slate in his hands.
"Alyss? Something wrong?"

She shrugged and then peered at the slate in his hand.

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-08 18:41:21)

Wess looked down at the slate he was carrying and shrugged in a half-embarrassed kind of way. It wasn't exactly the most enlightening and classy stories one could read, but at least he was reading, right?
"Just stuff my brother and I used to read together. Anyway, how are things? Has Liran got her party started yet? I know she was planning on one...kind of predictable, really."
Idly, he wondered what happened at those parties. He imagined they were like all the other boozers he used to endure while he was growing up; drunk men acting stupid, drunk women acting...stupid...and eventually the panicked flight when everyone realized that they had made too much noise and the authorities were showing up.
Did Jedi throw different parties? Maybe so, but if Liran hosted one he imagined that it would be the more common kind.
"I can't sleep. I'm not taking up your time, am I? I just heard you thundering down the hall and thought something might be amiss."

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-08 18:58:51)

"I seriously doubt that even **Liran** can get that party started now."
Wenton had been just a few steps behind Alyss in heading back towards the dorms. He had taken Master Visas's words to mean, "Get to bed now, padawan!" So, he had.
He walked up to the two Jedi and let Wess know what Visas had said about the mission on the morning.
"Well, I'm planning on getting a couple of hours of meditation time in, then heading back to the training room for some drilling. I kinda figure that the shuttle to Corsucant won't have much room, so I'd better get what I can while I can. If you two will excuse me. Good night."
Wenton waved at the two as he walked past and entered his room. Once inside, he unhooked his lightsaber and sat cross-legged on the floor, facing the door. While Wenton was sure the Enclave was safe from pretty much anything, he'd built up a habit that he had no intention of breaking now.
Reaching inside his tunic, Wenton pulled out the small golden cred that hung around his neck. He looked at the image of his father, Kenton Kether for a moment, hoping his father would be happy with the life he'd chosen and the path he was on. He had no real way of knowing, of course. His father was dead and one with the Force. Wenton had spent nights before in meditation, hoping that his father might come visit him. It'd happened to other Jedi before. Wenton had read those stories in the archives. However, it hadn't happened yet.
Replacing the cred to its place inside his tunic, Wenton breathed out and focused on the Force around and through him. He could feel the beat of his heart and the flow of his blood, but nothing outside his own body. His connection to the Force was strong, he felt it flowing through him, but it didn't reveal anything beyond his own body. So, Wenton directed the Force into relaxing his muscles and repairing any damage, major or minor, that had happened during the course of the day. He still felt a bit stiff from his duel with Ariss, but knew that would pass in time.
Wenton continued breathing as he allowed the Force to take him away from the physical realm, planning on waking up in four hours to get some early morning drilling in.

Alyss smiled at the mention of Wess' brother. She thought about her own family and how she'd miss them. She got a melancholy look in her eyes for a moment..Then she shook her head to his question.
When Wenton showed up, Alyss nodded along with his information and waved to him as he went off to bed.
She glanced back up at Wess, suddenly unsure of what to say or do..But she felt a bit closer to Wess in a way then she did to the others. They were both born on this planet, and, although they had only known each other as long as they'd been at the enclave, they had a lot in common. Life on Dantooine was never an adventure..
Suddenly, Link:*'Are you scared..?*'

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-08 19:54:19)

Wess nodded politely to Wenton and took in the added information. Coruscant, eh? He'd heard from some of the other padawans that it could be a rough place. He'd also heard that it was the very epitome of class and civilization in the galaxy, although he imagined that he if they were being sent on a mission there, it would most likely be somewhere a little on the unsavory side...unless the masters were planning on having the padawans practice their diplomacy skills.
He reacted to Alyss impression with a thoughtful frown.
"Scared? I suppose so. I've never been off-planet before, but I would be lying if I said I hadn't been dreaming of it for some time now. I really just want to go out and accomplish something useful for once, you know? I want to help people, and judging by what I've heard of the city-planet, they could probably use it..."
He trailed off. People in Dantooine could use some help too, but he'd failed at that already once.

Alyss nodded with renewed excitement. It really was going to be a great adventure.
She noticed that both her and Wess continued to space out at intervals, thinking their own thoughts. So she shrugged and smiled.
TL: *'See you tomorrow.'*
She then headed off to her room to stay for the night. Tomorrow would be the second biggest day of her life.

Wess smiled
"Have a good night."
Maybe he should try going back to sleep as well. If he continued to be unsuccessful, he'll simply give in and trance for four hours.
He hoped the next day brought him peace of mind, even if that night didn't.

*But my ability to focus is just fine, Master Visas, we just prioritize differently.* Liran thought while twirling the bottle absentmindedly. "Well, I guess I better retire to my quarters then. Have fun, everyone, â€¦ and a nice, quiet night." Bottle in hand, Liran skipped out of the Great Hall into the direction of her quarters, whistling a bawdy song she had overheard once in the lower sections of Coruscant.
However, once out of hearing range (and she knows well enough from past incidents just how good the Miralukan master's hearing was) she stopped and glanced back at the Hall. *Which part of 'sacrificing everything to run interference' didn't you understand, master?* Shaking her sleeve off impatiently, Liran raised the custom datapad molded around her left forearm and whispered a priority message on one of the private, un-monitored channels: <span style="font-size: 0.85em;">&quot;Control to all. From this very moment we move to alternate plan B. Use the documents I&#39;ve supplied. Control out.&quot;</span>
The visit to her quarters was a short one as Liran still had places to go and only needed to drop of the battle and retrieve a certain genelocked case she had brought with her all the way from Coruscant all those years ago.
<span style="font-size: 0.85em;">&quot;Comm? I know you are on duty, Jarik. Be a dear and cover me on the monitors while I go down to the basement. Liran out.&quot;</span>
Purposefully she strode into the dark and deserted workshop, exactly as Liran had expected and planned for. When they rebuilt the Enclave, the Jedi had ordered new, state-of-the-art equipment - with a number of interesting functions the Order did not care about and disabled subsequently. But with the right kind of gear and specific knowledge they could be enabled again, both of which Liran had brought with her from Coruscant. What a shame, she thought, that this trick couldn't be used elsewhere but for now it would do. Beautifully so.
After attaching the module and letting it coax the computer into accessing its buried features, Liran went to work, talking softly to herself:
"I like you, Master Brianna, â€¦ okay, I really like you, Master, but even I know that it is a rather stupid thing to sign a blank verigraph. Especially with me. Still, thanks. It is exactly what I need right now, even if I had hoped to save it for later."

*We'll have to make sure we have fun on Coruscant*
For a graduation it wasn't as... Eventful as he could have hoped.

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-09 18:03:13)

*Comm Control, 11.45 PM:*
Zari Narida looked up in surprise as Liran stepped into the room. The Zeltron Jedi was certainly (in-)famous around the Enclave for her aversion to work with 'technical thingies' because she favoured her 'personable skills'. *Personable Skills!* In Zari's younger days there had been other, definitely more descriptive, names for such a sleazy behaviour. And if this little harlot appeared suddenly out of the blue in the center of all 'technical thingies' instead of preparing for her mission tomorrrow, she was bound to want something. *Not good.*
"Evening, Zari. Say, I've been thinking about sending a message home before -this is the holonet console, right? By the way, it seems like all the cameras in the basement are out. Is that normal?"
Zari nearly told the Jedi where could she stick her a fake concern but the whole basement surveillance system being down would be a serious problem, indeed. Determined to risk only a quick glance, she nevertheless heard the most dreaded sounds a tech could conceive behind her the moment she turned her back.
... the humm of a lightsaber being ignited ...
... the groaning of melting metal and the screaming of burning circuits ...
... "Oops." ...
Whirling around, Zari stareds speechlessly at what had been a perfectly functiong holo-comm console only a few seconds ago.
"It somehow jumped into my lightsaber." Liran didn't even bother to don a sheepish smile as she dropped into one of free seats.
About to explode into a fury of screaming and cursing, Zari barely managed to reign her temper in when she realized that the Zeltron girl was deliberately goading her. Still breathing heavily, the head tech in her chair and regarded the Jedi through half-closed eyes.
"Care to explain why you'd just destroyed my holo-console? And, perhaps more important, why I shouldn't call your masters?"
"Zari, Zari, my girl, there's absolutely no need to call anyone because they will be coming here anyway. A bit later, though, but you'd absolutely cheat yourself out of the Grand Finale if make that call now." Liran chattered, blissfully unaware of a hidden camera monitoring the monitor room she did not account for and the old human proverb "Who watches the watchers?". Jedi sure are a distrustful lot. "I mean, who wouldn't want to see a girl who sticks her boobs in people's faces getting chewed out by the whole leadership of the Enclave?" Liran went on, laughing softly at the look of discomfort on the tech's face as she quoted her verbatim. "Yes, I hear things here and there. Some more interesting, some less. And I really have to tell you sticking one's boobs in other people's faces is nothing special. Everyone can do that â€¦ Drax!, even Alyss could do that. I just do it better because mine are bigger. But the real secret lies elswhere: pulling strings, playing the Game - that's the real art!"
After a moment of embarassing silence, Zari asked the question that was really burning on her mind: "All this ... just for your party?"
Liran only barely stopped herself from roaring out in amusement since she had no intention of hurting Zari's feelings any further. "My party â€¦ *MY PARTY*? Zari, it looks like I have to let you in on Zeltronity's biggest and best-kept secret: Zeltrons don't need parties, they are one. If I want the best party anyone could ever imagine, I simply close my eyes. And that's that. This is not about me or 'my party'. It's theirs," she said, indicating the monitors covering the padawans' quarters with a shake of her head. "Their's alone and they have earned it. Who can say where we all are in one year - some will have left the Order, some will have died in it's service and some might even have fallen to the Dark Side. I don't know and sincerely dount anyone else does. And that's why they have earned this party - not for me, the masters or the Order. Only for themselves. For their graduation after years of hard work. And I will ensure that this party is taking place, with the masters' consent or against their will - I don't care. Not one bit."
Clearly (and untypically) agitated by her own words and thoughts Liran jumped out of her seat and gazed at the black night beyond the Enclave's perimeter through the viewport of the room.
"You are one strange Jedi, Liran."
"Funny thing that, Zari. I'm not a Jedi nor will I ever be one. And don't you dare to tell me any different - I know what you and most others here are thinking. Hey, I can still get 'Jedi-trained Zeltron' but there's this thing about second places â€¦
Anyway, time flies and the show is about to begin."
Shaking the sad experession that had somehow crept onto her face away Liran flew back to the monitor banks and, more important, the public announcement system. The thrill of the game nearing its end banished eyerything lese from her mind, including the realization that apparently this whole party was slowly getting to her: because for a tiny moment she had actually imagined that her reflection in the viewport spoke to her. *"Hey, I am Liran. Who are you?"*

*Jedi Enclave, 00:01 AM:*
The public announcement system boomed to life, carefully adjusted to reach the living quarters throughout the building on a frequency that penetrated even Jedi trancing.
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**&quot;It&#39;s a wonderful morning on Dantooine. Welcome to the first day in your new life as Padawan of the glorious Jedi Order. This calls for a celebration. My name is Liran and I&#39;ll be your host tonight.&quot;**</span>
Bubbling with laughter, Liran leaned back in her chair and started the countdown " 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 " but Master Mical still managed to surprise her by bursting into the comm room almost two seconds early. Without turning around she flung the datapad lying next to the her over her shoulder and into his hands. "A present from Coruscant, Master Mical. A treatise by the historian of our Order, the honorable Master Brianna, about Jedi celebrations and how they are essential to communal spirit building, especially on joyous occasions such as this. Signed and verigraphed. Unfortunately, the holo console has suffered a fatal accident and the replacement module has somehow been misplaced, so you will have to believe the word of our highly esteemed historian. Even more so since a verigraph just can't be faked, right?"
Liran finally swiveled the chair around and grinned broadly at Master Mical, well aware of what was bound to follow.
"In other words: Welcome to the party, Master Mical!"

Lu'ren woke up with a thud as the announcement roared through the building. He rubbed his eyes and looked around the room, dazed for a moment or two. After remembering where he was he also realised just who's voice was filling the room.
*What are you up to nowâ€¦*
He sat up and noticed the Holo-set was on, he'd decided to watch a Vid to pass the time and it seems he'd fallen asleep. On the screen a well dressed Bothan was playing Pazaak with a slimy Hutt, He'd be dead in a few moments thought Lu'ren. ButThen he'd seen this movie a thousand times. Lu'ren now stood up and stretched his arms, Liran must have gone through a lot of trouble just to stay on the comm as long as she had... Maybe the party would be on after all.

Wenton emerged from his trance immediately upon hearing the announcement. He listened to what sounded like Liran fending off Master Mical. But, that couldn't be, could it? Would Liran really be that suicidal? Then he heard the comment about social gatherings and what not and thought to himself;
*Frak it all! You only graduate once!*
Rising to his feet and grabbing his saber in one fluid motion, Wenton clipped the elegant weapon to his belt and walked out of his dorm. Turning down the hall, he heard Lu'ren moving in his chambers.
Banging his fist on the door once, Wenton called out;
"You heard the lady. Party!" Walking towards Alyss's, Wess's, and Marcus's doors, he repeated the procedure hoping that would bring them around. Then, he bolted out the door and into the night. He just had to find the party. Wait, no. He had to find Liran. Wherever she was the party was.
Figuring she was in the Comm room, Wenton took off at full speed.

Marcus had finished meditating only an hour earlier, and the sleep he had gotten since was nowhere near enough to prepare him for Wenton's intrusion. He nearly leaped out of bed and stuck Wenton down with his lightsaber. What stopped him was that, in his tired state, he missed his lightsaber and grabbed a datapad instead, and then tripped over his bedposts, causing him to hit the floor. Hard.
Rubbing his head as he stood up, Marcus looked at the datapad in his hand. Recognizing it as **not** being his lightsaber, he put it back on his desk and grabbed his lightsaber instead. He paused in the doorway, considering just going back to sleep, but decided, *What the kriff, you only graduate once,* and followed Wenton.

Lu'ren stumbled into the corridor, he'd left his lightsaber behind. After all, why would he need it at a party? He sure wasn't planning on doing nay sparring for a while. He turned to see Marcus and Wenton run off down the corridor, probably to find Liran. He decided to follow though he though best not to run. He'd just end up with his face in the ground if he did. Noticing he hadn't got anything on his feet lu'ren began to stumble after them. He wasn't a morning person...

Mical wasn't impressed. For the remainder of the evening, Liran ran laps around the Enclave wearing a 10 kilogram sack (10 kilo= about 22lb for those unfamiliar with metric) with a pair of remotes programed to fire at her should she slow to a walk.
The following morning, Visas and Arrisa stood at the landing pad, behind them was a brand new *Dynamic*-class Freighter. It was painted in a white and green color scheme, and had only arrived from the manufacturer two days ago. It was to be Master Saur's personal transport, since it had been purchased with her personal funds, instead of those of the Order. The ship has even been named yet.
After the escapades of the previous night, there is little fanfare. The Padawan are lined up, Master Visas speaks. "It has been decided that the time is right to re-open the Jedi Temple on Courasant. So that is where your first assignment will take you. You will find the necessary cleaning supplies have been delivered by the time you arrive, along with additional utility droids."

## Re: The First step...

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-10 13:16:11)

*Cleaningâ€¦ Great. I can handle gangers, scum and multiple forms of villainy but cleaningâ€¦*
Lu'ren nodded as Visas spoke. It seemed like they would be heading to the Temple after all. But surely they didn't have the manpower to maintain it alongside the enclave. He stretched his arms and looked around at the other Padawans. Maybe he should be grateful that they aren't being flung onto Korriban or an equally deadly location.*It won't be long until we are.* He thought.
"It's going to take a long time to get the entire Temple fixed up. Where do we start?"

Marcus would later realize that Liran's party had saved him from making a very foolish choice today. Had he not gone without sleep for most of last night, he would have been able to put two and two together and realize that he was being sent to *clean* the Jedi Temple. If he had realized this, he may very well have done or said something very, very stupid. Since he was not capable of properly putting two and two together at the moment, he got only that they were going to the temple, and it was being reopened. Taking the moment to focus himself and come fully awake, Marcus resolved to perform his task to the best of his abilityâ€¦even though he would soon find out that it was something as simple as cleaning.

Wess gave a curt nod and looked at the rest of the padawans assembled. Noticing that they all looked a little less than enthusiastic, he decided to speak up; he wanted their first mission to be a successful one, and that won't happen if their hearts weren't in it.
"Come on, guys, it could be fun! We once restored an old abandoned barn nearby where I used to live. It's not so bad, and it looked great afterward! We get to make the first step to establishing a temple on another planet. Doesn't that make you proud?"
Wess had his arms out, his hands beckoning in an expectant pose. He wasn't a very good moral booster, but he hoped this would suffice.

(Going back to last night)
Wenton went running from the dorms at full speed when he saw Liran was starting to run laps around the building with ten kilo bags and remotes shooting her every now and then. Seeing this, he came to a complete stop and ran back inside the building. He certainly knew better than to upset Master Mical.
(forward to the landing pad)
Wenton stood at the landing pad in line with the other padawans. He had used what little time was left in the night to meditate instead of getting up for early drilling. He'd decided to not risk further upsetting the masters and stayed the rest of the night in his dorm. Now standing at the landing pad, he heard his first assignment.
Cleaning the Temple.
Wenton actually liked the idea. He knew from his mother and his personal studies that the Jedi Temple had at one time been a great cache of Jedi lore in the forms of scrolls, data pads, and holocrons. Lightsaber construction, force techniques, all of it might possibly still be there in the temple.
Hearing Wess's semi-enthusiastic pep talk, he decided to add his two cents:
"Do you people realize what we're being offered? We'll be in the Jedi Temple! The housing of the galaxy's largest library, as well as millenia of collected Force teachings. We might be the first ones to find these treasures. This is a huge deal!"
He hoped the others would see it this way.

"Been there, done that.. There's cobweb's the size of a starship in some of the chambers. I'd hate to think what created them."
Lu'ren was getting pretty excited but hid it well, the Temple was probably his favourite place, he'd spent alot of time there with Visas over the years. He was sure there was much left for them to discover though. He thought again of how huge the building was.*It can't be a simple cleaning job surelyâ€¦ They should be testing us not boring us*

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-10 18:20:04)

Marcus, now fully awake, absorbed what the others were saying and analyzed his feelings on the matter. Then, he spoke his mind, calmly. "I admit to a degree of annoyance at a menial task such as this. However, an opportunity to see the esteemed Jedi Temple on Coruscant seems more than worthwhile to me." Marcus then fell silent, arms folded across his chest and face expressionless. Someone with particularly good ears, however, would be able to hear him mutter, "<span style="font-size: 0.70em;">And see if it truly is as impressive as some say.</span>"

When it was time, Alyss boarded the transport. She thought it was very nice that Master Saur would transport them with her own personal ship.
Alyss was nervous. She had never flown before or been off this planet. And all she wanted was to strap herself in and not crash.
She was more pale than usual this morning...

---

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-10 18:32:59)

Hearing Lu'ren's comment about cobwebs, Wenton smiled.
"Then, this should certainly be a challenge, wouldn't you agree, Lu'ren? Not worried about a bug, are you?"
Seeing Marcus with his arms crossed over his chest, Wenton couldn't help but smile. That guy tried so hard to look serious. He'd blow a gasket one day if he wasn't careful.
Finally boarding the ship after Alyss, Wenton noticed her pale complection. He walked over to her and placed what he hoped was a comforting hand on her shoulder.
*We'll be fine*
He hoped that Alyss would take the comfort and be more relaxed on the journey to Coruscant. He knew, as did some of the others, the beauty of hyperspace travel. Wenton settled himself into his seat and strapped himself in for take off. He wasn't a pilot. He knew he'd better stay out of their way.

## Re: The First step...

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-10 18:41:26)

Marcus remained silent as he boarded the ship, sitting towards the back. He pulled up the hood on the black cloak he wore, bowing his head and crossing his legs. He then sliped into a trance, remaining fully aware of his surroundings, but focusing inward, in a meditative state.

---

## Re: The First step...

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-10 18:58:17)

Lu'ren followed them onto the ship, instantly heading towards the cockpit and gazing at the controls.
*It's.. Beautiful*
He longed for the day where he would have a ship of his own. To fly between the stars and go wherever he wished. That seemed a lifetime away now though, he sat in the co-pilot's seat. Hoping to see the Bird take off if Master Saur didn't decide he should go and sit somewhere less interesting.

*It's a brand new day â€¦*
... following an interesting night. A night of revelations. Revelations of friendship and enmity, revelations of courage and cowardice and, not least, revelations of past and present. Liran felt in her heart that there would be no going back now - the die had been cast and the future beckoned. *Her* future.
As she walked over to Arrisa's freighter - the spots where the remotes had hit still smarting with every movement - Liran looked one last time upon the erstwhile home she had now outgrown. With no more than a shrug she left the past behind and stepped up the freighter's ramp, only to stop at the last moment. *Out with the old, in with the new.* Smiling for the very first time on this day, Liran detached the lightsaber from the belt clip, hefted it and flung it away as far as possible.
*It's a brand new day â€¦*

## Re: The First step...

### **Avarna** (2009-03-12 23:20:57)

Liran's lightsaber seemed to hover in the air for a moment, before being drawn into Arrisa's hand. The Jedi Master then turned and smiled at Visas, "Don't worry, I won't abandon them on the Moons of Vega."
As each Padawan boards the ship, they are greeted by a pink colored droid with a female personality. It was an older model GG-series hospitality droid. "Hello, I'm GiGi, its a pleasure to meet you. Please let me know if there is anything you need. You'll find the sleeping Starboard Dormitory to the right, and the Port Dormitory to the left past the Main Hold." (follow the deck plan found in SOTG pg 81)
The Jedi Master then turns and walks towards the boarding ramp, and simply places a hand on Liran's shoulder. She doesn't say anything about what just happened, assuming that the Zeltron would speak with her should she desire to.
Making her way to the cockpit, Arissa pauses for a moment to look at Lu'ren sitting at the co-pilot's station. She seems to consider this for a brief moment, then nods. "Well, don't just sit there, Start the pre-flight while I go double check some things."

## Re: The First step...

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-13 09:44:09)

Lu'ren's face lights up as Arrisa speaks. He immediately runs his hand over a series of switches, flicking each into the on position. Starting the ship's diagnostic systems, after a few seconds a light above each switch turned green to signal that the system was functional.
"Engines green, Life support green, Computer systems green." He continued as each system gave a green light.

*Lu'ren seems to be enjoying himself in the cockpit*, Wenton thought to himself. Now that he was strapped in, he could poke around the ship's computer to see what kind of information the Holonet had on Coruscant. He'd never been himself and had only heard stories from his mother growing up. While he was no slicer, Wenton could atleast perform a simple net search for basic information. He busied himself with studying the history of the planet, till he got bored with it and started playing a solo hand of sabacc.

---

## Re: The First step...

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-13 17:02:11)

Marcus, noticing Wenton playing Sabacc, came out of his trance in order to check the terminal in front of him. Searching through its features, he found one that brought a smile to his face. Using the terminal, he sent a message to Wenton, Alyss, Liran, and Wess asking, "Anyone up for a game of Pazaac, Republic Senate rules?"
(OOC: I love Pazaac. By far the best KotOR mini-game. Best way to pass the time on a hyperspace voyage. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->)

---

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-13 18:01:11)

Wenton looked down at the computer screen with the message about Pazaac. He had learned Sabacc from his extended family on Corellia, despite his mother's protestations, but he was a little rusty on his Pazaac. Then again, since when did Corellians care about the odds? Leaning over the computer terminal, Wenton typed:
*Ok by me, Marcus. Something to pass the time would be a welcome distraction.*
Looking over at Alyss, Wenton smiled.
[TL]
*You in?*
Wenton knew better than to ask Liran. **If** she'd play, it would't be pretty. He still rememberd that *friendly* game of Sabacc he'd played her once, just once. The memory of going back to his dorm at a Force-propelled run in his birthday suit had always made him a bit skittish to play the Zeltronian again. Wenton may be a Corellian, but he tipped his hat to the professional from Zeltron.
Plus, though he'd never been able to prove it, he was sure that Liran cheated.

## Re: The First step...

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-13 18:51:47)

Marcus brought up the computer-based Pazaak game, and linked his console to Wenton's. The virtual cards were dealt, and Marcus snarled at his hand. *Bah! I despise mono-colors.* Seeing that his score was only a five, he passed, shifting it to Wenton's turn.

---

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-14 00:43:09)

Wess was about to reply before stopping himself. Was pazaak really appropriate right now? They were going on their first mission as Jedi Padawans, surely there was something better for them to do with their time. Something more constructive, maybe even educational.
Screw it. Math was involved, wasn't it? Strategy and all that?
"I'm in."

Alyss began to relax more as the journey got underway. She started looking around and becoming more interested.
She smiled over at Wenton and got closer to the group to watch. Alyss had never been very interested in the game and so she had never bothered to learn.
She glanced over at Wess when he spoke and gestured to the seat beside her and across from Wenton and Marcus (not sure if that's the layout but oh well).

Wenton drew four cards from his side deck and then one from the table deck before playing it down.
A seven.
Deciding to not play a card from his hand, Wenton passed to Wess.
Wenton realized that he'd better learn this game too.

Lu'ren relaxed as all the ship's systems turned green. He wondered about what the ship could be called though.

The Obsidianâ€¦. Noo*
He continued thinking of names whilst turning to check the Navi-computer. Co-ordinates for Coruscant seemed in order.
*The ship's in perfect shape, won't be for longâ€¦*

Idly typing away on her personal datapad, Liran blinked in exasperation as Marcus' message flit across her terminal. *Republic Senate rules! What will be next? The Retirement Fund for Elderly Jedi? Whatever happenend to 'No risk, no fun!'?* Liran let a calm, friendly smile slip onto her face as she rose from her seat and swayed over to the players to lean on Wess' headrest.
"Boys, boys, boys. You know why it is called 'Republic Senate' ? Right, because it doesn't achieve anything. I think it's about time to move on to the grown-up version - just perfect for all 'apprentice-no-more' *Padawans*. I already introduced Wenton to it some time ago and could tell he loved it. I mean, *really* loved it," she finished with a tantalizing wink in Wenton's direction.

Wenton squirmed in his seat a bit at Liran's mentioning of her first, and so far only, lesson in Pazaak's *other* set of rules.
"Liran," he said looking up from his terminal at the Zeltronian manipulator. "We're Jedi, we don't have money to gamble with. Since we **can't** gamble, we've only one option; Republic Senate rules like Marcus said. What else would you have us do?"
As the words slipped from his mouth, he realized that he'd probably set himself up for a bad thing.

## Re: The First step...

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-14 21:22:39)

"Looking" up from his intense gazing at his console's screen, Marcus registered Liran's comment. If he had eyes, he'd have rolled them. "Also, I can guess at what lengths you might go to to win with credits involved," he muttered, "looking" back down at the screen in front of him. Grumbling once more at his abysmal hand, he drummed his fingers on the console, waiting for Wess to finish his turn.

## Re: The First step...

### **Avarna** (2009-03-14 22:27:17)

Master Arissa Saur, walked into the main hold as the various Padawan were discussing Liran's potential to *bend* the rules of Parzaak. And leave it to most mysterious of their three trainers to offer a solution to they're trouble. "GiGi was programed to be a dealer in a Parzaak den on Belor Six. Why not ask her to keep an eye on Liran? But don't let her play."
Then the Master was gone once again, checking on the engines and making sure everyone settled in well, before returning to the cockpit and settled into the pilots seat. She doesn't look at Lu'ren, but speaks. "I've always like the Dynamic-class. They always have a hand-crafted homely feel to them. It's unfortunate the line is coming to an end, I believe the one under construction will be the last."
The take-off was smooth and graceful, the sort you expect from an experienced pilot. Moments latter the ship broke though the atmosphere, and into the the void of space. "Would you like to take the controls?"

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-15 00:00:53)

Wess smiled a little and shook his head silently at the other padawan's banter as he gazed intently at his own deck. He hadn't played this game in years, and he wasn't very good at it when he had; instead of strategy he had always just thrown down what felt right... and would lose his shoes because of it.
Sheesh, didn't anyone play marbles anymore? Now *that* was a game...
He sighed a little bit; if he overthought it too much he'd have a fit.
He slapped down four cards until he had a total of +16. Then he held seeing as how he didn't really have anything that could make it higher without going over.

## Re: The First step...

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-15 06:16:32)

Lu'ren smiled and nodded, looking at the controls in front of him. The ship seemed designed to allow either Pilot or Co-pilot hjave full control without having to move around.
*Saur's right, this ship does have a hand crafted feel to it.*
"Have you thought of a name for her yet?"

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-15 10:35:10)

*Oh, Wenton, why do you have to make it so easy?*
Looking at him in confusion, Liran asked hesitantly "Money? Gambling? What does this have to do with â€¦?"As Liran's eyes flew open in surprise a teasing smile grew on her face nearly from ear to ear. "Wenton, you naughty rax! I can't believe you are thinking of *that*! No really, I try my best to teach all of you something to dispel the boredom of Republic Pazaak and all you can think about is taking advantage of poor little me and Alyss! I am so disappointed!"
Unfortunately, the delightful bantering is rudely interrupted by Marcus. "It's a free galaxy," Liran turned slighty to address Marcus. And even though her expression and tone did not change, her voice somehow acquired a certain icy quality. "So you are free to 'guess' whatever you want â€¦ but you are also free to keep your 'guesses' to yourself, period. Something I'd advise you to do, because your 'guessing' and actually knowing anything are two very different beasts."

Liran's amusement only grew in the light of Weston's increasing embarrasment. Never one to let anybody off the hook too easily, she decided to turn the 'thumbscrews' yet another bit. Not too far, though, as his bashfulness was kinda cute. Plus it was nice shade of red, after all.
"Alyss knows? **Alyss knows?!** I am shocked! So all of this was just engineered for your own nefarious purpose? To feed your twisted desires - at my expense? I am ashamed, deeply ashamed â€¦ because it could have been done a lot better. I can't really fault you for wanting to sneak a peek here and there at all - I mean, who doesn't? But trying to rope all your fellow padawans into a round of Strip Pazaak just so you can get a better view? Why didn't you just ask?
Anyway, I think you definitely need further instruction. *Private* tuition even. And believe me, boy, I can teach you *so much*." Lira practically purred before straightening herself and leaving boys and girl to their boring game with a final wink at Wenton.

Wenton stammared and stuttered for a few seconds before falling completely silent. He'd been brought up differently than Liran obviously had and had no idea what to say or how to respond. He simply looked down at his Pazaak screen with a distracted look in his eyes, completely unable to focus on anything due to the embarrassment that he'd just suffered at Liran's cruel, cruel words.

"Liran, I believe you have an exercise Master Visas gave you to do." Arrisa reminded the Zeltron about the Oxygen Bottle exercise that she failed to complete on Dantootine prior to they're leaving. Hopefully the young woman would spend half the journey focusing on that task.
Turning her attention back to her co-pilot. "I don't get caught up in naming a ship. Its my ship, and the registration is good enough to distinguish it from another. But I won't stop you from naming it if you like."

"I've never been creative.. maybe a name will present itself after some time," replied Lu'ren whilst focusing on the space ahead. He moved his left hand over the intercom and spoke to the rest of the ship, "We'll be jumping to hyperspace in a few minutes. You might want to take a seat."

"I'll quieten down when I'm gone, Lu'ren," Liran said sweetly from the cockpit entrance. "No other way â€¦ well, a gag could possibly work â€¦ or perhaps â€¦ Anyway, you've been missing a most interesting development. Who would have ever thought that â€¦ but I don't want to 'bore' you with these thrilling new news. I mean, piloting's hard work, right? Takes a lot of concentration, no distractions allowed and so on. Anyway, I have an exciting date with a bottle - fascinating personality, really. Way better than some alleged 'living beings'. Lousy sabbac player, though. Well you can't have it all." She chattered, apparently oblivious of any looks of remonstration.

Grateful that Liran had finally stopped tormenting him, Wenton strapped in to the webbing of his seat after hearing Lu'ren's comment about entering hyperspace. Then, remembering that Wess and Alyss had never gone off planet, Wenton turned towards the two;

Wess sighed and shook his head to himself. He was terrible at this game.
As Liran went off on her little speech, Wess' face became more and more vague as he tuned her out until all he could hear was the chatter of her voice with no real distinguishing words. He didn't really need to actually hear what she was saying; in all the time he'd known her she pretty much kept saying the same thing. He wondered if she would be any help at all during the reconstruction of the temple.
He buckled himself in for hyperdrive silently, absorbed for the time being in his own thoughts. Without any real knowledge of the layout of the temple, he couldn't really think of a very good game plan. He resolved to make it his top priority to search the place and set priorities. Maybe he'd make a list... yeah, that sounded good.
While the other players were taking their turns (if we're still playing) Wess began to click away on his datapad to see if he could find any information on the current status on the temple they were flying to.

Unstrapping himself, Wenton stood up and helped Alyss into her webbing. When he was convinced that she was strapped in good and tight, he sat himself back down and re-strapped in. Then, looking back at the screen, and promptly realized that in all the commotion that Liran had caused..., he'd forgotten who's turn it was.
"Um..., Marcus? Who's turn is it?"

"It's my turn, sorry." In actuality, it had been Marcus's turn for nearly the whole time Wenton and Liran had been talking. The problem was, Marcus couldn't decide how to play. He had drawn a nine this round, adding to a total of 14. This meant that he was close enough to 20 that a high draw would put him over. And with his lack of red cards in his hand, he had to be careful of that. On the other hand, none of his cards could bring him close enough to 20 to be sure of a win. Finally, deciding he couldn't hold up the game any longer, he chose to stay in and hope that his next draw was low.

"I am disgusted! Simply disgusted! You just can't keep your hands to youself, right?" the beautiful Zeltron laughed when she caught Wenton adjusting Alyss' webbing upon her return from cockpit, the devilish smile on her face showing clearly that she was up to no good - just as usual. Evidently she hadn't lost her skill in sneaking up on people in their most embarassing moments.
Making her way past the other padawans - not without playfully bumping into Weston - Liran almost shook her head at the sight of the pride of the Order, the next generation of Jedi, dutifully buckling up like little children. Veteran hands at travelling knew, of course, that 'entry shock' upon going to hyperspace was a rare phenomen that only happened with novice pilots, if ever ...
The steady stream of Gamorrean invectives hailing from the engine room only mere moments after the ship accelerated and Liran had suddenly vanished (ungracefully tumbling down the whole length of the corridor) only underlined her previous concern: Novice pilots were indeed the greatest danger of all!

Wenton turned bright red, again, at Liran's comments. Instead of answering, though, he stayed quiet in his crash webbing, hoping that Alyss didn't think he was like **that**.
However, Wenton's face stayed bright red a few moments later, though from something else, when a slight bump in the entry to hyperspace caused the Zeltron to fall head over heals into the engineering section of the ship. Wenton could not stop himself from laughing at the manipulative little demon getting her just desserts.
Wenton tried to open his mouth to say something, but simply laughed again, unable to control himself. He figured that Liran would ask for help if she needed it. He did briefly wonder how she'd learned to snort like a Gamorrean. Finally able to control himself;
"Liran! You ok? By the by, where did you learn to snort like that? Your last boyfriend?"
Wenton howled in laughter.

"Sorry about that!" Lu'ren laughed for a moment as Liren rolled down the corridor, somewhat ungracefully. He walked past the Pazaak table and looked into the engine room form the doorway.
"I never knew you were a mechanic.." he said after finding Liran sprawled on the floor near the Hyperdrive, "You should wait until you see my brilliant landing.."

In order to keep other, more important body parts from getting injured Liran had taken the inevitable impact on the hyper-engine block on the least sensitive one - her head. With the resulting **"CLONK!"** still reverberating in her skull she suddenly realized that the architect of her misfortune was somehow now standing beside her and snarled at him - quite literally because her dazed mind had still not switched back to Basic from the Gamorrean she was currently cursing in. In an astounding series of snorts, grunts, snarls and other disgusting sounds she berated the Zabrak, belittled his flying skills and cursed his tribe and ancestry. 'Astounding' mostly because of her almost epic repertoire of imaginative insults and the still correct pronounciation of them despite her obvious lack of tusks. (The latter probably being less surprising for those who had come to witness - or even fell victim to - her amazing talent for voice-imitation.)
Once her throat began to tire and more of her mind had eventually returned, Liran rose from the floor and hissed, now in Basic again: ""You are so lucky the Jedi don't give out flying licenses, otherwise I'd have yours for this. Let Arissa pilot - that can't be much more worse. As for this," she indicated the hyper-engine with her right foot, "fix.it.yourself!" Underlining her last words with a series of kicks against the unyielding piece of machinery, Liran whirled around and limped 'majestically' out of the room.
And though she had meant to pass the other padawans indignantly Wenton's guffawing, not to mention his insinuations and general lack of respect, definitely merited *punishment*.
Leaning against the doorframe she made a miserable face and replied in a small, pain-filled voice: "No, I'm not okay. I must have hurt something rather badly."Giving him a few moments to let that sink in, she then went on with a slowly spreading grin: "Thus I require an immediate and personal examination. Thanks for volunteering, Weston! I knew you cared! Just give me a give a few moments to get rid of this bothersome robe and don't bring anybody else - I know what a shy and modest girl I am!" Now openly roaring with laughter Liran finally strode back to her dorm.

Lu'ren scratched the back of his neck as Liran hurled alien obscenities at him. He was pretty glad that he could understand only a few of the harsh words, a few was enough however and he'd stopped laughing completely by the time she left the room.
The hyperdrive core seemed fine but it wouldn't hurt to take a look. Lu'ren stepped towards it before realising, yes, it would hurt a lot. Tinkering with it now would probably land them in deep space or worse, in the outer rim. They'd have to hope her skull really wasn't thick enough to do anything to the intricate machinery.

Wenton was chuckling to himself as Liran strode through the main hold area where they were all sitting. He stopped dead cold, though, at Liran's lewd comments about an examination. At these comments, he simply lowered his face and muttered,
"It's **Wenton**, not Weston."
Wenton could handle a lightsaber fight, flipping end over end near a precipice, and probably even fighting Sith Lords, one day. However, he had **no** idea how to deal with teasing females. He also imagined that Liran knew this and was exploiting it. He still didn't know how to stop her.
*Short of killing her, that is.*
As the thought came to mind, Wenton quickly shook his head to clear it.
*That wouldn't solve the problem*, he thought. *She'd just come back as a Force Spirit and then **never** shut up.*

Drawing a card from the table deck, Wenton drew a seven. Combined with his previous seven, Wenton's hand now numbered fourteen. Deciding to stay pat for the moment, stemming from his lack of attention due to Liran's tortuous teasing.

Wess looked in Wenton's direction, marveling at how uncomfortable Liran could make the poor guy. She literally got him with the same line every time. He wondered how she would act when she got older and her... parts started to droop. He couldn't help but smile at the image of her freaking out when she finds her first wrinkle. Then what would she have? Sarcasm?
He wondered if he should say something to Lur'en; it wasn't his fault she didn't buckle in and he didn't look too happy about it.
"Don't worry about it, man, you did fine. It's not like she could have done it better... just get a maintenance droid to work out those dents and pay her little tantrum no mind."

The remainder of journey to Coruscant went by as uneventful as Liran would allow it to be. Which became remarkably more peaceful once Master Saur locked the Zeltron in the meditation chamber so she could focus on the Oxygen Bottle exercise she seemed to be avoiding.
Arrisa took the controls of the ship and brought it through the atmosphere. Already its abundantly clear that the world is fated to become covered in buildings making it just one large City, The Padawan crowd into the cockpit to watch the shifting cityscape, before the Jedi Master finally brings the ship to rest upon a landing site on the temple grounds.
"Lu'ren, will you please show the others to the Dormitory, and help them find unoccupied rooms." Master Saur instructs them, as she slowly places the systems into stand-by mode. "Once your settled in, we'll meet in the Council Chamber."

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-23 21:30:12)

Wenton turned at the mention of **un**occupied rooms.
"Unoccupied, Master? I thought the entire temple was abandoned? Or did I misunderstand?"
Wenton looks around at the tall spires of the Temple. He knows enough history to know what he's standing on top of, and to explain what he's feeling.
A Force Nexus. A powerful convergence in the Force. Here, they would rebuild the order. Here they would start again the Light against the Dark. Here they would...
Wenton's attention was drawn away as Liran stepped out of the ship. Maybe the Nexus could also help the group's party animal. Maybe something inside the temple would eat her.

"Yes master," Lu'ren replied to Saur before taking a look around the cityscape. He could feel a buzzing inside him, he was back. Back where things mattered and he could change them for the better. A place where he could make a difference. He headed into the temple after a few moments, walking through the pretty decrepit corridors, avoiding cobwebs and fallen masonry.
"Rooms are through here," He said to no-one in particular. Gesturing to a side corridor off one of the larger rooms.

Due to his inability to see the way normal people do, Marcus was able to "see" the temple without obstructions like the webs and rubble. He was able to see what it represents, not what it was. The Force was strong here, and Marcus could feel it. *Even if our purpose here is not grandâ€¦being here in itself is a worthwhile event.* With this thought in mind, Marcus entered the corridor Lu'ren had pointed out.

Wess was stricken with an awe-induced silence as he walked towards the rooms in the famed Jedi Temple. The sheer power and *history* of the building filled him with... something he couldn't quite name. Many times as a boy he would imagine following the footsteps of the heroes before him, wondering if he would ever be worthy enough to do so. The very thought that the Jedi of old, heroes all, had walked just where Wess himself was walking was truly astonishing.
A sad sort of smile made itself visible on his face; the exhilaration he felt was wonderful, but a dark little voice in the back of his mind wondered if he could control himself enough in the times to come. He didn't want to lose this feeling.

Arissa smiled shyly. Then proceeded to answer the question. "The so called occupied rooms, are honorary quarters that have been set aside for Jedi that we believe survived the Dark Wars, but have yet to return to the Order. Rooms have also been set aside for the all the Masters, even though we are rarely all here at the same time."
And with that Master Saur disappeared down a darkened hallway.

Wenton realized for the first time that there might actually be other Jedi out there in the galaxy. They could have survived and might one day return. He knew the importance of Jedi surviving and wanted to make sure that this Temple was ready for them. Turning towards the rooms that Lu'ren pointed out, Wenton chose one close to the others and began to lay out his things.

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-24 22:50:07)

Marcus made a point of walking as far down the hall as possible, and taking a room that had no other rooms adjacent to it. He entered the room, unpacking all his belongings, and claimed it as his own. Once this was done, he sat in the middle of the floor and began to meditate until they received their first task.

## Re: The First step...

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-25 08:48:11)

Lu'ren's room was near the centre of the corridor. Most of his things were already there, after all he'd used the room before leaving for the short stay at Dantooine. He checked everything over it seemed to be the same as when he left.

Wess chose a room right next to Wenton's. He didn't really have much to unpack... basically he emptied what was in his pockets.
Like Marcus, Wess meditated in the middle of the room until their first assignment, contemplated his place in the grand scheme of things.

*Coruscant! How terribly â€¦ exciting.* 
Liran barely stifled a yawn as she walked down the ramp onto the Temple grounds. As expected, the temple hadn't changed one bit since her last visit to the Republic's capital. Stagnant and unyielding, it was truly a fine symbol of the Order.
The flight had been a rather amusing experience, especially with Arrisa's childish antics. If she really was a typical example of what the Covenant had created it was absolutely no wonder that it ended in such a disaster. *"Brains was never a requisite for becoming a Jedi and all too often it just gets in way."* her former teacher had been fond of saying - there was a certain ring of truth to it, even - or especially - after all her years in the Order. But nevertheless she had used the solitude well, finally finishing her report for Compeer, and even got some engaging intellectual discourse with the bulkhead out of it, quite a change from the usual "Duh!" and "My lightsaber this, my lightsaber that ..." she was forced to endure when talking to the other padawans.
.
.
.
Quite deliberately Liran chose the room opposite to Wenton's since she still owed him an *apology* for misremembering his name and they really needed a bit of privacy for *that*. She dropped her bag onto the bed but did not unpack anything, still adhering to that essential piece of wisdom of her youth: *"He who travels light travels best."*

Wenton was unpacking what little belongings he had, his lightsaber was already attached to his belt. Those few possesions included a small holo of his mother and brothers, and a seperate holo of his father from before his death. Seeing the holo of the man he barely remembered, Wenton reached into his jerkin and pulled out the Jedi Cred from around his neck. Touching the golden medallion to his lips, Wenton looked at the floating image of his father and returned the heirloom to its place around his neck. Looking at the hologram, Wenton spoke very quietly.
"I won't let you down, Dad. I'll be the Jedi you would want me to be. I promise."
Having finished unpacking, Wento stowed the small bag in a corner as he heard a sound behind him in the hallway. Turning, Wenton was rather shocked to see Liran picking a room directly across the hall from him. He'd kind of hoped that Alyss would be close to his room. He felt more comfortable around her. She was quiet and shy, making Wenton feel needed. Wenton contemplated what this meant for him psychologically for a second before snapping back to the reality of Liran being across the hall from him.
He quickly went to the door to check and see if it had a lock on it. A good secure one. One that could hold back a Gamorrean if needed.
As Wenton checked the door, he realized that Wess was next door to him.
*At least there's a second padawan close by who isn't a wild party animal close by. Maybe there's hope for a good night's sleep. Maybe.*

The two hours pass quickly, with the majority of the Padawan taking the time to meditate. Like you were instructed, you all meet Master Arrisa Saur in the chamber of the Jedi Council. Arrisa is standing next to the stone in the center of the room, her fingers tracing the hole where the Jedi Exile had stabbed her lightsaber into it as the weapon was surrendered to the Council.
"Its been over Twenty years since the Jedi Council has been convened in full. Master Mical, Master Marr, Master Brianna, Master Sylis Dran, and myself, have discussed it when time has allowed, and we all agree that there is one thing that can wait no longer. On the Planet Telos, Master Atris awaits under house arrest, waiting for the Jedi Council to hold a trial for her part in the destruction of the Jedi Order.
"So, Your mandate is to prepare the Temple, and most importantly this Chamber, to host the Trial of Atris." Arrisa then walked over to one of the council seats, and placed Liran's lightsaber on it. "I'm leaving within the hour to retrieve Master Atris, and bring her here. Wess and Allya will accompany me. The round trip should take roughly two weeks barring unforeseen difficulties. Any Questions?"

Wenton looked around the ancient room and thought on the histories contained here.

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-27 06:13:34)

*Two weeks and the whole temple? That's going to be a lot of work for the boys.*
Thankful that Arrisa did not choose her for company because they'd probably have driven each other insane over the course of the trip, Liran revelled in the feeling of freedom this piece of news stoked within her. Even if she would have liked to visit her 'home' for a spell or two ... to meet old friends, have spectacular parties and kill a Quarren or two - just your usual 'homecoming' stuff. Still, two weeks without a watchful master nearby were a lot of time to get things ... *done*.
She also catalogued mentally that Atris had apparently been held within her own "kingdom", the sanctuary on Telos IV. One never knew when such information might come in handy.
"A Jedi trial for Atris - now?" she asked aloud, only to add with an entirely innocent expression: "I really wonder if this is just the first of many. I mean she wasn't the only one to bring harm to the Order â€¦ one way or the other, not?"

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-27 18:05:27)

Wenton turned towards Liran with a look of surprise on his face.
"Not the only one?, **Not the only one?** How could you say that? Atris's obsession with the Sith led to the destruction of Katarr and the Jedi Enclave there."
Wenton paused for a quick look in Marcus's direction.
"Did you know that I actually have **no** idea how my father died? All I know is that he died in the Dark Wars. I don't know how, when, or where. He may have died on Katarr with so many other Jedi. All because of this woman who allowed her hatred of the Sith to lead her to exposing the Jedi to Nihilus and also lead to the death of thousands of Jedi and millions of Miralukans. Whatever punishment the council gives her, it will be just. It will be a fair punishment for what she did."
Wenton paused, his breath coming in ragged gulps at this point, his focus undeniable as he pushed his anger down so it doesn't engulf him.
"**So**, if you don't want to help get this place ready for her trial. Or if you think that work is beneath you, then fine. Just stay out of my way as I do my duty!"
Wenton turned from Liran and stormed off, intent on finding cleaning supplies and getting started at once. This place **would** be ready for the trial of the traitor Atris. He would make sure of it.

Sighing in exasperation Liran calmly raised four fingers of her right hand to underline the points she was about to make by lowering one after another as she went down the 'list'. Unfortunately, Wenton was once again having trouble keeping his facts straight. And even his departure didn't stop her reply - she just made sure to raise and modulate her voice accordingly and use the echo to ensure he caught her final words. Sometimes, being a trained orator was a lot of fun.
"First, there never was a Jedi Enclave to Katarr. Conclave, yes - enclave, no.
Second, no 'thousands of Jedi' died on Katarr - less than hundred were left in the galaxy at that point and even fewer actually attended the conclave.
Third, Atris did not 'hate' the Sith. Only the Covenant was built on that foundation â€¦ and failed disastrously. She actually believed to have better reasons for the decisions she made.
Fourth, regarding the 'just' decisions of the Jedi High Council and the 'fair punishment' it hands out - I wonder what the Exile would have to say on that?"
And just for a tiny moment - barely enough to recognize the change - Liran's face twisted in an undecipherable expression at the mention of the 'Jedi Exile'.

Marcus had remained silent and still throughout Wenton's speech, and then Liran's list. When both had finished, he turned to Liran and uttered one word: "Idiot." He then walked past her, pushing her slightly as he did so. He picked up his pace enough to catch up to Wenton, who he then walked beside. He said nothing, knowing he was rather poor at communicating his meaning. Instead he placed a hand on Wenton's shoulder, a simple gesture meant to remind Wenton to watch his angerâ€¦as well as remind him he was never alone.

## Re: The First step...

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-27 19:27:09)

Lu'ren stood dumbfounded as the events unfolded around him. He stayed still until Wenton and Marcus had left before turning to Liran.
"I get the feeling you may have been able to handle that situation slightly better then you did..."
He wiped his brow whilst looking around, "You're going to have to learn to get along sooner or later.. I'm guessing it'll be later.." he trailed off unenthusiatically.
For all the trouble Liran caused he always felt she just wanted to be noticed and recognised, she just went about getting it in.. antagonistic ways.

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-27 19:39:28)

As Wenton stormed down the hallway, he heard Liran's comments towards him. More than anything at that moment, he wanted to turn around, ignite both sabers of his blade, and kill her out right. He never would, he knew, but the feeling was there. The anger, powerful and addictive, was telling him that he'd be justified in the act.
As he was fighting this internal war, Wenton felt Marcus's hand on his shoulder. He didn't turn towards the blind Jedi, and Marcus didn't speak, but Wenton knew what the gesture meant. He knew that his feelings were wrong. Anger was the path to the Dark Side. That was a path he didn't want to follow.
*How would my father view me now?* It was all he could think about. He knew that he'd acted in an immature manner. Liran was as entitled to her opinion just as much as Wenton was. Even if she was wrong.
Raising his own hand, he patted Marcus's and breathed deeply, trying to calm himself.
"Thank you, Marcus. Thank you for being here when it's easier to not be. Thank you."

"It isn't your place to decide if Atris is responsible or not. That is why there is to be a Trial." Master Saur replied, hopefully cutting short any further. She took a deep breath as Weston and Marcus stepped out. Turning her attention fully to Liran.
"You'll find the materials you need in the storage room on level 6. Maintenance droids will see to the corridors and many of the more public areas. At the moment, Only the Council Chamber and the Chamber of a Thousand Fountains need the attention of Jedi."

"Then Jedi should get to it," Liran quipped easily, unperturbed neither by Wenton's outburst nor by Arrisa's show of authority. And since she had been told often enough that she wasn't much of a Jedi Liran had not intention of being much of cleaning lady, either.
"As for you, Lu'ren," she said, turning slightly to focus her attention on the Zabrak. "Now that was an interesting piece of advice you just gave me. Were you really trying to tell me that the proper way of 'learning to get along' is to lie? Because what I told Wenton was merely the truth - the blunt, unmerciful and utter truth. I take it you disagree with this course of action?"

"The truth may be.." Lu'ren didn't bother to finish the sentence. He was certain Liran would just have a comeback for whatever he said anyway so he walked to the window and looked out onto the city planet.
*There must be more Jedi out thereâ€¦* 
The thought crossed his mind whether or not they would ever meet any force sensitives.. and what would happen if they did. The tales of the Sith were enough to make him tremble, though he was sure by now that the mention of their ability annihilate Capital ships was a lie on Liran's part..

Lira nearly fumed as she once again experienced the reaction she despised most: unafraid of any physical confrontation the little Jedi ran away when they should be talking to her instead. And, as usual, her irritation was channeled into acidic sarcasm.
"Already checking for dirty spots on the viewport, Lu'ren? How diligent!"
Already on her way to leave the Council Chamber in a huff, Liran stopped one last time near the entrance of the room and appealed to Lu'ren almost imploringly before she departed. "Since you can't answer *my* questions, just ask yourself: 'How can you let someone loose on the galaxy beyond these walls if he is not even able to face the truth?' "

Wenton stopped at the storage chamber on Level 6. He found some of the basic cleaning supplies Master Saur had previously mentioned. Loading up with a basic muck rake and cleaning liquid, he headed back towards the Council Chamber. As he walked, Wenton thought about what he would say to Liran when he saw her again. Whether or not he had the specifics right on his previous statement, he had been angry when he'd last spoken with her. He knew that had been wrong. He shouldn't have allowed emotion to cloud his judgment like that. He knew that he owed the Zeltron an apology. He just hoped he'd know what to say before he had to.

## Re: The First step...

Lu'ren turned to face Liran, the viewport was in fact dirty, probably hadn't been cleaned in years.
"The truth should be told yes, but you have to work with him. I though you Zeltron's were supposed to be charismatic?" He said whilst walking towards her. "Maybe you should just work in the Fountain room for now. And Wenton can work in here...?"

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-28 18:09:46)

"Oh, but we are." Liran smiled. "All Zeltrons are superbly charismatic, just as all Jedi are gentle masters of diplomacy who favour talking over ever drawing their lightsaber, eh? Anyway, I can be if I want to and see the need for it â€¦ but coddling Wenton doesn't even come close. I am sorry that he lost his father but - as he said himself - he doesn't even know what exactly happened. Perhaps he died on Katarr when Atris thought she had found an adequate solution for her problems, perhaps he died on some backwater planet in a drunken cantina brawl over a lithe twi'lek dancer. Highly improbable, but not impossible. The point is Wenton does not know and wild speculations won't help. And even *if* Kenton Kether died due to Atris' machinations will he let that overshadow his whole life, his very being? His being a Jedi - just like his father?
Remember that you are all Padawans now, sooner or later you *will* be released upon an unsuspecting galaxy. If he still carries that baggage then, somebody will suffer for that. Either Wenton himself or, worse, others.
Nobody can afford to live in the past - the Jedi least of all."
Back to her usual pertness, she left Lu'ren with one final piece of advice - Liran-Style - as she moved to leave the chamber, this time for good. "And the next time you see him, take your lightstick and beat some sense into Wenton. Hopefully that will work better than a soft Zeltron touch.

Marcus had followed Wenton to the cleaning supply room, but chose not to use any of the tools he found there. After all, why use manual labor when the Force was far more effective? He began using the Force to levitate pieces of rubble and throw them out already broken windows.

"Lightstick.." The image of Wenton being struck in the head with a stun baton crossed Lu'ren mind for a moment before he realised she was refering to his lightsaber.
*You do have to be.. more blunt with some people*
"Hey, I haven't seen you fight yet.. If you're as good with that saber as you are at riling people up, you'll rival Visas in no time..."
He took a few moments to think about her words before his mind wandered again to the infinite possibilies of Coruscant. He desperetaly wanted to get out there and into the deep city.
*Once Saur is goneâ€¦ Then I can get back*

Arissa didn't intrude in the conversation between Lu'ren and Liran. Perhaps the Zeltron had more wisdom then was being given credit for. She did however walk to Marcus, clearly disapproving of him using the Force in such a matter.
"Marcus, Be mindful of your actions. What of people walking on the sidewalk below? Or perhaps the Aircars between here and there. Remember that your actions can have far more impact then you think." Placing a hand on the Padawan's shoulder, she shared her sight with the Miraluka for a moment. Showing him the crater left in the streets of the Undercity, and a young Rodian boy that barely escaped injury. She left him then with that thought in his mind.
"Wenton, A moment if you will." Master Saur asked the young man, as she met him in the hallway on her way back to the Ship. "There is a Lightsaber practice call the Cadence. They are a series of them, That I believe will help you."
The Jedi Master paused then, and took a deep breath. What she was about to say was clearly difficult for her, "I know your father's fate."

Marcus was stunned by what he had seen through the master's eyes. Not particularly because of the rodian he had nearly killed, but because he had, for one brief moment, seen as normal beings saw. And it was beautiful. Marcus was never more glad to be wearing the metal mask he covered his eyes with, because after seeing like that, tears came to his sightless eyes. And Liran would probably never let go of it if she knew that he had cried over such a "mundane" thing.

Wenton nodded numbly, barely aware of what Saur was telling him.
*Something about cadences. Hadn't father's notes mentioned something about them?*
As he was mulling this over, the next statement brought him up right. Turning towards the Jedi Master, Wenton couldn't hold his question in.
"You know what happened to my father? Please, Master! Tell me!"

---

## Re: The First step...

### **Avarna** (2009-03-29 08:34:23)

"He didn't die on Kathaar." Arissa answered, debating within herself just how much to say to him. Master Arissa Saur is something of a mystery. Even know over twenty years after the time of the Jedi Covenant, there is still no records of her. She freely admits to having been a Shadow for the Covenant, but has remained closed lipped about missions.
"He died by my hand, on the orders of the Jedi Covenant."

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-29 15:21:12)

Wenton half-heartedly listened to Saur as she spoke about the cadences. He'd heard about them before. He seemed to remember something in his father's notes.
However, Wenton stopped and stood upright when he heard that Saur had killed his father. On orders of the Covenant, no less!
*The Covenant! The ones who actually **caused** the return of the Sith!*
Turning slowly towards the Jedi master, Wenton felt his anger building within him. His hand hovered over his double saber at his side for an instant. Wenton struggled within himself against the feelings he had.
*This* master *killed my father! And now she tells me in **secret**?*
Looking into Saur's eyes, Wenton carefully enunciated each word as he spoke quietly.
"You're telling me that the Covenant ordered my father's death. The *Covenant*. The very group that caused the return of the Sith ordered the killing of father. Can I at least know why? Why did those who threw away the rules and regulations of our Order want my father killed? Was he going to expose the Covenant? Was he going to expose you? Is this why you told me here, in **secret**? Am I about to have an *unfortunate* accident to cover your tracks? **Well? What's your answer, *Master***"
Wenton managed to contain his emotions to his words alone. He knew that he wouldn't survive a fight with the Jedi master, though there was a part of him that at that point didn't care. He still didn't want to dishonor his father's legacy. He would be the Jedi in this case. He would control himself and await the answer.

"Actually I gave Visas a really good run for her money once," Liran chimed into Lu'ren thoughts, poking her head into the room 'round the corner of the entrance. Unfortunately, she lost track of her own thoughts again almost immediately. "Well, it was more like my money â€¦ and I never expected the old bat to be that quick on her feet. All over just one Exclusive Limited Edition - really *tastefully* done to boot. Nevertheless, that sure was one hell of a 'run' - I hear it still places regularly near the top of the Collectibles lists. Ah, those were the times â€¦
Anyway, where were we? â€¦ Oh, yes, lightsticks. Truth be told, you have seen me fight many times, Lu'ren, you just didn't realize it. I prefer to fight on my very own field of battle, by my own rules. A lightsaber just tends to get in the way.
Besides, I've never been properly taught how to use one. You remember the partial collapse of the training room some time back? I mean who had the fantastic idea of resting that part of the ceiling on just one pillar and then not even saber-proof it? Careless, careless â€¦ I bet your remember that - must have been around the time I started carrying around a training saber around most the time, I think."
With one last conspiratorial wink Liran vanished again.

## Re: The First step...

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-29 15:56:40)

Lu'ren trembled a tiny bit as the memories of the collapsed training room filles his mind. That room had been well maintained.. And now he was here for two weeks in an already collapsing building with no supervision. And he didn't trust his own chances of curbing Liran's destructive tendencies. He sighed as she left and walked back to the window again.
*Tonight, tonight will the time..*

"I can feel the anger coming from you Wenton, and that leads to the Dark Side." the Jedi Master warns the padawan. She doesn't reach for her lightsaber, but continues to speak. "The Covenant will be judged by its actions, not by its intentions. We'll never know what might have happened if the Covenant hadn't done as it did, Or what might have happened if Zayne Carrik hadn't caused its destruction. No ultimately, the lesson of the Covenant is a lesson against trying to alter the future.
"I tell you this, only because its now apparent to me how much not knowing troubles you. I promise to tell you more one day, but you must learn to master your anger first. Like Liran needs to learn Focus, you still need to learn control. The Cadence will help with that."

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-29 17:06:43)

*Control? Control is the only thing keeping me from committing suicide by attacking you here on the spot!*
Wenton didn't voice his thoughts, but also didn't bother hiding the anger in his face. He stared at the elder Jedi for a few seconds before answering.
"So, no answer at the moment. Fine. I can wait for the answer, but it **will** come. It may not come when I want it to, or even when you, Master, are ready to give it, but it **will** come. Now, if you will excuse me, I believe I have *janitorial* duties to attend to."
Wenton finished his words with a crisp, if short, bow. Turning on his heels, he headed towards the Council Chamber with the new information burning in his mind. He would **indeed** find the answer. It may not even be Saur that gave it to him.
*Didn't the Covenant have its headquarters here on Coruscant? I'm going to need a tour guide while Saur is gone on assignmentâ€¦.
I've got to find Liran or Lu'ren. Probably Liran for what I have in mind. She's the devious one.*
Wenton paused in a corner of the hallway and reached out with the Force, trying to locate Liran.

Marcus returned to the janitorial closet just in time to hear Wenton's last sentence. Wondering what it was about, he approached master Saur. "What did he mean by answers? Why is he so angry at you?" Marcus, never one to procrastinate, began gathering supplies even as he asked his question, pausing only to hear her answer.

## Re: The First step...

### **Avarna** (2009-03-29 20:48:11)

Wenton has no problems sensing Liran speaking with Lu'ren
Arissa turned to Marcus, "Its no longer my place to answer that. I would speak with Wenton if you want to know more."
With that, The Jedi Master walked directly to where her ship prepared for the long journey ahead.

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-29 23:41:09)

Wenton follows the Force till he finds Liran. Seeing that she's talking with Lu'ren, Wenton waits off to the side for them to finish first.
*Let's see. "Liran, I came to apologizeâ€¦" I've got to figure this out. Best start with the apology and then move right in.*

---

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-30 09:42:34)

Turning around around from her door-to-room chat with Lu'ren, Liran nearly jumped in suprise when she found Wenton standing behind her. *Creepily* standing behind her. And though she had already put their earlier altercation behind her Liran wasn't going to let him off the hook as easily, just because.
"Aha! Just now you stormed out in a huff and the moment I turn around you are sneaking back up to cop a feel! I knew you were a dirty rax, Wenton, but â€¦ I seem to have underestimated you. Good to know there's still hope.
Anyway, you came to apologize for your outburst, right? About time, I have to say. I was deeply hurt and insulted by your ungracious behaviour. That's your idea of thanks for all the kindness I've shown you? I just don't know if my poor heart will ever heal."
The effect of Liran's lament and the sorrowful mien she showed were definitely undermined by the broad grin she continually tried to suppress and which still kept tugging at the corners of her mouth.

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-30 16:43:33)

Wenton watched as the Zeltronian jumped when she saw him.
*Hmmm. She can be surprised. See how she likes this.*
"Actually, I didn't come to apologize. While, yes, I agree that I owe you one, I'm not sure how to word it just yet. That's not the point of this visit, though. I need your..., ummm..., *unique* skills."
Wenton watched her face to judge her reaction.

With her grin now in full bloom, Liran answered passionately while fiddling with the collar of her robe: "Finally! I just knew you'd see it my way, sooner or later! Hurry, I don't want Arissa stepping in on us." Closing the distance between the two of them with a quick step, Liran then grabbed Wenton's collar.
"No, really! I am just dying from laughing. Wenton, it doesn't need a Zeltron to know something's running amok in your head. Are you going to spit it out or do I have to beat it out of you?"
A dead serious Zeltron can be a scary thing, indeed.

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-30 17:46:14)

Wenton was unphased by Liran's first comment, but slightly surprised by her second.
*So, she has a serious side after all.*
Wenton doesn't even move away from Liran as she has her hand on his collar. He keeps his voice low so as to not be heard.
"While that might be interesting to see you attempt to beat me in combat, I don't have time for that now. I have a favor to ask. After Master Saur's left the planet, I need to find a certain building. You're familiar with Coruscant, aren't you? Do you know where the Draay Estate is?"

## Re: The First step...

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-30 17:51:38)

Lu'ren heard Liran speak somewhere behind him. He didn't turn but tried to passively listen in. He was slightly confused by what he heard, he must have missed a few words.. Or he was just too tired. The Hyperspace journey seemed to be catching up with him.

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-30 18:06:50)

Liran matched Wenton in volume as she replied.
"Nope, no idea. Lu'ren's the resident expert on sight-seeing tours. When I was here my teacher deliberately avoided anything even remotely connected to the Order. So we either ask him or I'll have to pull it from a computer - shouldn't be problem. But the place is, at best, a ruin, destroyed by Republic ships more than 30 years ago. Probably picked clean - by Jedi or others if not both - an age ago if you are looking for something." Slightly tightening her grip on his robe she went on. "But nothing comes without a price, especially not with me: I want to know why. You are a hothead, We*s*ton, in more than one sense. No way, I'm letting you go out there with your "mad-hat" still on."

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-30 18:14:03)

Wenton nodded as Liran explained that she wasn't the one he needed to find the residence. However, that didn't mean that she wouldn't be useful. Looking down at the red skinned manipulator, Wenton spoke,
"My mad hat will probably stay on for a while, Liran. You want it gone, then help me get into that mansion. That mansion is, or was, the headquarters of the Jedi Covenant. They were a secret order within the Jedi Order."
Wenton paused as he considered whether or not to impart the next bit of advice. He dipped into the Force to search his feelings to see if he could trust Liran.

Liran rolled her eyes in mock annoyance.
"I know about the Covenant, silly. I also know that Arissa was one of their shadows, so perhaps you should ask her. Not that she's going to tell you anything.
But, hey, that was a very nice evasion â€¦ not too shabby at all â€¦ in fact, that was lousy. I want a reason, preferably a good one, why you are so suddenly interested in the Covenant." And then she added with a sweet smile "And please don't forget that, unlike me, you are a really bad liar."

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-30 19:15:50)

Wenton breathed deeply, having not gotten an answer through the Force.
*Liran's hard to read. No doubt about that.*
Sighing and looking Liran in the eye, Wenton began,
"Fine then. According to Saur, the Covenant ordered my father's death. I'd like to know why. I'd also like to make sure that the Covenant's really gone. I figured that of all people, you would enjoy an *outing*."
Wenton put a look on his face that easily (especially for Liran) read, 'And that's all the information for now.' Noticing Lu'ren still standing there, Wenton turned his head and spoke up.
"Lu'ren, I know you're listening. Can you help me find the place?"

---

## Re: The First step...

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-30 19:29:18)

Lu'ren quickly turned when he heard his name mentioned. He walked towards the pair and faced Wenton.
"I don't know where it is specifically, but I think I know someone who does. A friend of mine, he knows the area well. I can contact him but we'll probably have to meet in person. Might take a few hours.. Look, I won't ask for your motives or why you want to go there but I'm doing this as a favour. I'd like to think you owe me one?"

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-30 19:37:09)

"Sounds interesting." Marcus's voice came from the other end of the room. He had been searching for Wenton to ask about his conversation with Arrisa, and walked in early enough to hear most of the conversation this time. "Mind if I join in?" He asked as he walked over to the three other Padawans.

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-30 19:48:39)

Wenton's face frowned a bit at the Zabrak's mention of keeping score.
"If that's what it takes, then I'll owe you one. I imagine that Liran'll take her payment in making me do her share of the cleaning."
Wenton began to pry himself free of the Zeltron's grip when he heard Marcus behind him. Turning around, Wenton looked at the eyeless Miraluka for a second before answering.
"If you want. I know that I could certainly use the help..." Turning to the whole group, Wenton completed his sentence, "... from all of you. Lu'ren, when do you think we can meet this friend?"

---

## Re: The First step...

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-30 19:54:40)

Marcus cut in before Lu'ren could answer. "It seems wise to avoid doing anything other than what we are expected to until Master Saur has left orbit." Marcus, now standing only a meter behind Wenton and Liran, stood with his arms crossed, but his senses were anything but still. He sought out master Saur, attempting to approximate her location.

## Re: The First step...

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-30 20:05:32)

Wenton's first response was to say that they should go and if Marcus wanted to wait, that was his business. However, something told him that Marcus may have a point.
"Agreed. Besides, I believe that Lu'ren said earlier that his contacts would take a few hours anyway. In the mean time, why don't we continue cleaning up?"
Now completely detaching himself from Liran's hands (claws in Wenton's opinion), Wenton grabbed his cleaning equipment and started to work on the Grand Council Chamber.
*Saur might be a fake, a darksider, or someone who was lead astray. That doesn't change how important this place is. If we can't get to work immediately, I'll get to cleaning.*
Wenton didn't want to admit to himself that he really didn't want time to think. Especially not about what Saur had said to him.

Marcus seemed to snap out of a trance suddenly, and said, "I don't sense master Saur on the planet. Still, we might want to be careful. Let's wait for an hour or two." He grabbed a nearby cleaning tool, and set about cleaning. No sense wasting time until they were clear.

Liran's answer to Wenton's challenge could be read just as easily on her face, 'Suuure!'. "See, that wasn't so difficult, was it. And now we can all be *friends* again." she finished with the customary suggestive wink at Wenton.
The rest of discussion/planning Liran followed in silence, her mind already turning wheels while the amateurs still plodded along. Disguises, IDs, etc. ... there was a lot to think of. When they finally came to the conclusion to adjourn the foray and go back to cleaning, she decided that it was time to act: Tiptoeing over to Wenton she suddenly hugged him from behind and whispered 'sweet nothings' into his ear:
<span style="font-size: 0.85em;">&quot;You know I don&#39;t like secrets. *When* I find out what you withheld from me you are going to pay for that. Dearly.&quot;</span>
