# [Path's of Corruption] Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-01 21:25:01)

You have arrived safely on Nar Shadda, where the hunt begins. The masters gave you no further information than what was told to you in the briefing, and the ship you came in has just taken off to return to the academy, leaving you without a transport. You are entirely on your own, with only one directive: find Arken and his contact, and then kill them.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Welcome to the Paths of Corruption.**</span>
You see before you a rather old and poorly maintained landing pad. You have obviously arrived in a poor section of the moon, and there are hardly any people around. A Rodian walks up to you, most likely to ask for a docking fee, but runs off after taking one look at you. A pair of Twi'leks stand near a stack of crates, conversing with one another. A rusty protocol droid walks by, his every movement causing a squeak. Lastly, a Quarren seems to be working on a damaged speeder, but careful observation will reveal that he is taking occasional glances in your direction, as if studying you.

Dawntracker begins to realize that he will not be the most stealthy here due to his Sith issued Trooper Armor, but since the Rodian ran off scared perhaps he is not smart enough to realize that their is not much of a Sith Military Presence on this planet.
Dawntracker looks back at the "others" and lets them know what he is gonna do.
"Sadly I am not gonna be real subtle here with my Armor on, but I figure if I draw the attention to myself maybe they will come after me or one of you will find them first."
Dawntracker heads in the direction the Rodian ran, since he was obviously frighten he may give out some information. Fear does have unusual effects sometimes.
Dawntracker looks back after a few steps
"I don't suppose I should count on any of you coming to lend a hand if I run into trouble, but let me know if you need a hand."
Dawntracker heads off in the direction of the Rodian with his Blaster Rifle in hand, showing he means buisness should any of the locals get any bright ideas.

Noticing the Quarren sneaking glances at the group, and Danwtracker going off to *waste* his time scaring people, Dorn decided it was time for information.
"Greetings, sir. Undoubtedly, you work around this port. And I'm sure you've seen other ships here. What I'm even more sure of, is that you want to tell me if you've seen a Dynamic-class ship in the past few weeks. It's name was the Star Skimmer."
Peering into the Quarren's eyes, Dorn reached deep into the lower being's mind and **pushed**.
"**You want to tell me. You want to tell me now.**"

The Quarren seems to fight against your influence for several moments. Then, he caves, and says, "Yeah, I've seen it many times." He seems to begin to say something else, but regains his control and stops himself. Then, he reaches for something under his jacket.

Seeing the Quarren reach his hand inside his coat pocket, Dorn snickered.
"Well, since you put it that way."
Reaching into the Force that connects all beings, thus allowing the manipulation of all beings, Dorn finds that spot in the Quarren's body that dictates fatigue, exaustion, and consciousness. He reaches out through the Force to knock the wind from the amphibious rogue.

Garak stood silently, scanning the area around him. That Trooper was going to scare the Jedi into even deeper hiding if he wasn't careful. He was certain he'd have better luck if he began to search on his own. This Moon seemed abundant with various species, he wouldn't look out of place.

The Quarren convulses in pain as the Force rips through his body, rendering him immobile. A hold-out blaster drops from his jacket due to his convulsions.
Davkas doesn't notice anyone attempting to make a move against him.
Garak notices that the droid appears to be carrying a datapad, which he is attempting to hide from your view.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **Tempeste** (2009-04-02 08:34:54)

Garak noticed the droid's futile attempt to hide the datapad and moved towards him slowly, as to not arouse any suspicion. Once he was close enough Garak deftly raised his hand and drew upon the force, he attempted to grip the datapad and move it into his own hand.

Slowly walking of their ship behind the others, Gisah shook his head and chuckled.

Now that the Quarren was unconscious on the ground, Dorn stooped down and quickly pocketed the hold-out blaster pistol. Then, he reached out with the Force, extending his hand over the unconscious body, and lifted the amphibion off the ground and carried him back towards the Dock. Once he had him behind some crates, he began to look around for some rope to tie him up.
Seeing Gisah standing there, Dorn turned towards him,
"Gisah, help me tie this one down to the chair here, if you please. He has information about our target. I need to *interrogate* him."
Dorn smiled, relishing what was coming.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **Tempeste** (2009-04-02 16:04:11)

Garrak began to grow frustrated and began to lash out with the force. Raising an arm and propelling compressed air towards the mechanic being. It didn't matter whether the datapad had anything of importance on it anymore, he just didn't appreciate it when things resisted against him. Especially droids.

Dorn successfully finds some synthrope nearby. It looks exactly long enough to tie up the Quarren.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-04-02 18:04:04)

Once again shaking his head, Gisah began to regret ever accepting to join the Sith Academy. If people called the few Chistori that wandered the Galaxy short-tempered, what would they call the Felucian he travelled with now? Insane?. And the other one, desperate to brandish his power over the weaker beings of this planet, just because he could. Beginning to walk away from the landing pad and towards an area where there might be more populated, he answered Dorn without even turning around.
"No no, heÂ´s all yours. "Interrogate" him all you need, perhaps itÂ´ll keep you out of harmÂ´s way"

(2/5 Force Points)
After making sure the Quarren was fully tied up, Dorn sat back and rested himself for a minute. He needed is full strength for this.
Once he was ready, Dorn reached out and grabbed the tentacled head of his prisoner.
"You **really** should've just given me the information. However, I'm glad you didn't."
Feeling his conscious free itself to some extent from his body, Dorn dived into the mind of the unconscious victim with complete disregard for the mental health of the Quarren or pain that he might feel. He broke through the barriers of the mind, looking for the information that the Quarren had on the Star Skimmer or on Arken Oyels.

You plunge through the useless memories and knowledge until you find what you seek. You see an image of a lush, jungle world, apparently where the ship in question is supposed to be. However, before you can learn more, the Quarren's sanity snaps and he is rendered brain dead. However, you do successfully withdraw from his mind before its death.

Falling back on his rear after exiting the Quarren's mind, Dorn looks disdainfully at the now brain-fried creature.
*So weak. And so utterly useless! I've got to get better at that!*
After resting a minute or so, Dorn stands up and looks around to see what around him, like the canyons Nar Shadda is so famous for, might help him dispose the body. No sense in leaving evidence behind.

Finding a suitable ledge, Dorn looks down at the Quarren and notes again that he'd never be able to life the being with his arms.
*The Force is my strength.*
Reaching out with the Force, Dorn lifted the Quarren out over the edge and quietly dropped him where it looked he might fall the farthest.
*Maybe he'll hit someone else down there.*
Knowing now that the Quarren thought the ship was somewhere else, Dorn decided to see if any other Force users were in the area. Sitting down in his private area, Dorn reached out with the Force to look for any Force users in the area.

Sighing to himself for this dead end, Dorn walks over towards Gisah.
"Well, we now know two things. One, there are no other Force users nearby. Two, the Quarren thought that the Star Skimmer is on some lush forest covered planet."
Sighing to himself, Dorn began to rack his brain as to what he should do next.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-04-02 19:10:13)

"Great. And I trust you think it was worthwhile to dispose of the Quarren just to gain *all that information*?"
The Chistori sounds quite unimpressed.
"I guess weÂ´ll have to go look then. There should be some places where we can find information"
He heads of towards more populated areas, just to get a feeling of where they are.

Dorn follows in Gisah's wake. This was certainly out of his element. He'd never toured much of the galaxy in his life. In fact, he'd been to exactly four planets, the fourth one being the moon he currently strode upon. He also kept his mouth quiet around the big saurian. No point in upsetting him more now.
However, he did constantly keep his senses attuned to the area around him, just in case.

"My skill **indeed**. Or do you forget it was my skill that got us the little bit we have? Or, did you manage to gain something from droid before it plummeted to oblivion?"

Dorn remembers to what kind of plants he saw in the memory.

Dorn ignores the comment from Gisah as he explains the forests he saw in the memories.
"I have no reason to doubt the Quarren's memories. He thought it was true. And, at the moment, it's the only lead we have. Though, even I must admit that it's very lacking."

Dawntracker traps the Rodian in one of the alleys a distance from the Landing Pad.
"Listen Rodian I will make you a deal, I need to know about a smuggler you tell me everything you know you get to walk away to live out your life......"
Dawntracker points taps his Rifle a bit.
"...but if you lie your going to regret the last few minutes of your life, now do we have a deal?"
Watching the Rodian nod in Fear Dawntracker continues
"This Smuggler would have come in on a Dynamic-class and would be here to meet with some friends or a contact, now tell me what you know so you can go like we agreed and as a bonus if you lead me to him you will get a reward and still be free to go...so what is your choice?"

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-03 14:36:35)

"*D-Dynamic* class? Th-there are many ships of that class that comes here often." The Rodian says, nervously glancing left and right in fear. He attempts to reach for something in a concealed holster without you noticing, but you spot his hand's movement.

Dawntrackers voice tone indicates he is not playing around any longer

The Rodian immediately drops the hold-out blaster to the ground, and you slide it away from him using the Force. He puts his hands up, whimpering over and over, "Please don't shoot, please don't shoot!"

Dawntracker sighs loudly, he didn't have any reason to kill this alien other then he tried to pull a blaster on him...but he has done the same thing...like when he met Jarg...
Dawntracker lowers his Rifle a bit
"Look you did as I asked and droped the Blaster, I'm not going to kill you so just tell me what I need to know so you can leave and if you have ever met a Sith Trooper before or even a Sith you know I would have killed you for even reaching for it.."
Dawntracker lowers his Blaster Rifle as the Rodian wasn't a threat at the moment
"Just tell me what you know about the Smuggler and where to find him if you know, don't warn him about me and avoid the men you saw me with and you will most likely live through the day, I think that is by far the most merciful act you will ever get from a Sith or anyone on this planet so spill it.."
Dawntracker just wanted the info so he can finish the mission...he had wish at times things didn't have to be like this but you do what you have to to survive, after all that was not only the Sith way but the way of the Galaxy.

"N-no! I-I won't tell you anything! Y-you won't take me alive!" The Rodian suddenly pulls out a thermal detonator, which he activates. The explosion throws you back, badly burning you. The only thing left of the Rodian are the black marks on the walls and ground.
Davkas takes 15 damage.

Dawntracker sits up and exasperates loudly from the Thermal Burns as the pain slowly dissipates from some nerves either calming down or dying.
Dawntracker gets up rather slowly now knowing that Rodian "was" the most likely lead to the Smuggler or insane.... most likely even with the explosion no one would come to see what it was as most people here would no better to help someone here....unless they were a Jedi
Dawntracker waits a bit to see if anyone come to see or help, if not Dawntracker will leave the Alley and find himself an Arms Dealer for some new armor as the one he had on would not help him anymore without a Squad with him, then most likely a Medic or a Cantina to take away some of the pain.

Dorn continues to walk behind Gisah and next to Garrak. As he walks, he ponders in his mind the best way to continue the mission, as it is obvious that *these* two will never figure it out. Inspiration hits and Dorn starts to reach out through the Force, sampling emotions. If he can figure which people are most scared of them, maybe those will be the ones with information.

Garrak stopped as a small explosion fille dthe air with noise for a moment. Quickly glancing around he noticed the Trooper was nowhere to be seen.
*Imbocile.. That savage will get us all killed.. Sooner than planned.*
Places like these thrive on information, someone here must make a living from selling information to the right people.. That gave Garrak a thought.
"There must be an information broker nearbyu, I suggest we find and, get an answer from them?"

"Yeah, that sounds like a good idea to start"
Rubbing his ears as the Aurak Amplifier he wore had amplified the sound of the explosion a little more than he had wanted to, Gisah figured it wasnÂ´t even worth shaking his head.

Dawntracker was some what surprised he had found the Power Suit, he was just about to give up when he came across this Merchant in a far corner of the Merchant Area.
Too Bad the Armor was so overpriced, but then imagine what he would charge for a Sith Trooper Armor, besides the scanners they have now make it impossible to be a Spy these days but that is classified so the merchant shouldn't know.
Luckily for Dawntracker his Armor was still in good condition, minus some Thermal Burns but anyone decent with a Fusion Cutter and a Hammer could fix it up.

Dawntracker clears his mind and takes the Power Suit and takes whatever possessions the Merchant had on him.
Dawntracker then heads off to an Alley off in the distance to change into his newly acquired armor and looks for a place to throw his old Armor to the near bottomless depths of the Nar Shaddaa.
After this he takes a moment to look through the possessions he took from the Dead Merchant to see what would be worth keeping.

Dawntracker after putting on his gear and tossing what he didn't, decided it was now best to make his way to the Local Cantina to look for the smuggler or get info as to where a good place to find one was.

A gray skinned Toydarian flies up from behind the counter, greeting you with, "What do you want, eh? You here for a drink or some *action*?" He makes a subtle nod to the card tables, indicating that there were some seats open. "Or do you want some information? We have some of the best information brokers on the moon here, I think, eh?"
Your brief glance around the room tells you little more then that it is dark.

Dawntracker looks at the Toydarian, ~I have met there kind before, they would sell out their own mothers if they could make a credit~
"I do need some information, would you be the one to ask or is there someone else I would talk to about meeting up with a certain smuggler?"

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-03 23:59:04)

"Well now, that would depend on who you're searching for, I think, eh?" The Toydarian, presumable Sokko, scratches his chin, as if considering the question. "If the guy you're looking for is a local, best to start with Grudo the Hutt. He pretty much runs this sector, and he know everybody that lives here, eh? If he's from off world, though, then your best bet is to talk to the spacers we get through here all the time. Chances are, if they don't know 'im, they'll know someone who does, eh?" Then the bar keep sticks his finger in your face, saying, "But if you are thinking you're stayer here, you better order something! We don't allow no stinkin' freeloaders in this establishment, eh?"

Dawntracker know a little about Hutts, enough that they know everything that happens in an area and their greedy, that should be his source to find the smuggler and maybe his Jedi Friends.
"Thanks for the info, so this Grudo the Hutt would be located where and how would I get to meet him and I am in a bit of a rush to get the info I need..."
Dawntracker takes out 300 Credits and hands them to Sokko the Toydarian
"The credits are for the info and if you should happen to hear anything about a Smuggler piloting a Dynamic-class Ship, try and let me know as there might be more credits in it for you friend."

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-04 00:19:14)

The Toydarian burst out laughing at this. "There are lots of smugglers who fly old *Dynamics* in the galaxy, kid, heh heh." He seems to consider your statement for a moment. "The Hutt'll be in his big fancy casino over on the other side of the sector. Kriffin' worm takes all the decent profits there are to be made in the area. ...But anyway, you could get just about anyone to show you the way, eh? Hard to miss, I think, eh?"

### **Tempeste** (2009-04-04 06:53:57)

Garrak nodded as the Saurian spoke, "You go find this information broker... I'll try and survey the area, look for anything out of the ordinary. Remember, this could be much bigger than a single smuggler and a Jedi." As he finished speaking, Garrak moved off into the shadows, trying to keep his prescense hidden whilst looking for any groups of people, there must be a few gangs around here who'd like nothing more than to help a goody jedi get killed.

Dorn listens to Gisah and Garrak make their plans.
*They're still thinking like mud soldiers, not Sith. However, my own plans so far have not turned up much. I know I won't be able to keep up with the fungus in the shadows. I'd better tag along with the saurian and see how I can help with the information broker.*
Without saying anything, Dorn continued to follow Gisah.

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-04 08:29:44)

Garak overhears a Trandoshan talking about a "Jedi-loving smuggler" who was doing business "the boss" recently. You remain unnoticed, hidden around a corner from the Trandoshan and his friend.

Gisah watches as the Felucian moves away. He felt that both of them were probably out of their native elements on this urban moon. Not to matter though, he was certain they would come through. Heading of in another direction, he started to search for a cantina or some other place where one could usually find people holding information.

Entering the cantina, Gisah looks around, searching the corners of the cantina for the type of shady characters that normally sat in the background watching things. He walked up to the bar counter, resting heavily on it while looking around.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **Tempeste** (2009-04-04 08:55:20)

Garrak waited for a few moments, wieghing up his options. Walking straight up to them might not be a good idea. He decided to wait and see if one of them left, it's much easier to.. Negotiate when people are alone in a dark alley.

---

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-04 09:02:02)

Gisah notices Davkas and Sokko talking as soon as he walks in. A further check of the room and you notice several card tables, for Pazaak, Sabacc, and other games, on the rear wall. Also, some booths line both of the other unoccupied walls, but no one seems to be sitting in them. All the other patrons of the cantina are at the card tables.
After ten minutes of waiting, the person the Trandoshan was speaking with leaves, while the Trandoshan stays in the alley.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **Tempeste** (2009-04-04 09:05:38)

Garrak watches the person leaving, waiitng until he's out of sight before slowly walking into the alley. He moved towards the Trandoshan, as silently as possible. Not attempting to remain hidden, but to simply create the effect that he easily could have if he wished it.
"Alien, You know something, something I wish to know."

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **Tempeste** (2009-04-04 09:14:16)

"Who do you work for?"" Garrak raised his hand in a gesture as he spoke, it probably meant something to other Felucians but to a Trandoshan, nothing.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

"That's an organisation, I need the name of who your *Boss* is. Don't worry, I have something important for them. They'll thank you for leading me to them." Garrak had a vague idea of what the Exchange was, an old Duros had muttered the name to him a few months ago before swiftly dying. He was sure it would complicate things though.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-04 09:20:10)

While Gisah walks over towards Davkas, who is sporting a new armor, *Where did he get **that** from?*, Dorn looks around the room and notices the gaming tables.
*Hmmm. Maybe there's some information to be had overthere.*
Dorn walks towards the gaming table, using the Empathy power to help out, looking for someone who doesn't feel comfortable in the cantina. He's also keeping an eye open for people who might be working at a computer, or selling information. Dorn was painfully aware of the fact that he lacked the requisite skills to work in such an environment. He needed to upgrade.

"Your boss has an interest in the Jedi yes?" Garrak produced his Rubat Crystal from a small pouch before raising his hand to show it to the Trandoshan thug. "This is a rare lightsaber crystal, I'm sure your employer would be interested. I have many more."

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-04 09:27:26)

The only one in the room who seems uncomfortable in this setting is Dorn himself.
The Trandoshan takes one look at the crystal before grinning wide. "Oh, he want that. I take you to him, yes?"

---

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **Tempeste** (2009-04-04 09:29:25)

"Yes, please do." Garrak placed the crystal back into the pouch before standing aside to let the Trandoshan lead the way. He had the sudden feeling that he may be getting himself into a situation akin to blundering into a Rancor den..

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-04 09:33:02)

The Trandoshan leads you to a hanger that, compared to the rest of the sector, seems quite well maintained. The Trandoshan stops at the door, turning to you and saying "You leave your weapons here. No see boss with them."

Dorn sighs to himself.
*I guess there're no easy victims in here. I may have to go looking elsewhere.*
Certain that Gisah and Davkas could handle just about anything that came their way, and not really caring if they couldn't, Dorn walked out of the cantina and began looking for a parts junkyard.
*If someone is running around in the old derelict that I saw earlier, they'd need to repair the thing. They'd need parts. Maybe a repair shop would be a place to check.*
Dorn starts looking for a repair/ parts shop, preferably with only one or so workers in it at the time.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **Tempeste** (2009-04-04 09:38:25)

"Of course," Garrak replied whilst removing his weapons, clearly placing the Lightsaber and Skullblade into the Thug's hands, "I expect them back in one piece."
*I don't need a weapon to be deadly…*

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-04 09:40:31)

Repair shops, being much in demand in this sector, are plentiful. Only one nearby seems to have only one employee, however.
The Trandoshan nods absently as he stares at the lightsaber you hand to him. He takes it and the skullblade and enters the building.

As you enter the building, you hear a few people scramble around, as if rushing to get to their posts. When you turn the corner into the main hanger bay, you see five people with blasters pointed at you. A voice reaches you from behind them, saying, "Apologies for the rude welcome, but that lightsaber means you're either a Jedi, a Sith, or someone who killed one. And any of those could mean trouble for us." The voice's owner, a Rodian, steps around his guards, smiling dangerously at you.

Upon finding a worker by himself, Dorn knows he's found the place he needs to be. Walking into the shop, dorn puts on his most disarming smile. He also reaches out with his mind, wanting to make sure that he saw the only being in the shop.
"Hello, friend. I am in search of a particular smuggler. He's done some work for me in the past and I wanted to contract him again. He pilots an old Dynamic ship called the Star Skimmer. His name is Arken Oyels. He is a human. Would you happen to know where I could find him?"

The Zabrak running the shop appears to be alone. "Ah, Arken, eh? He's pretty famous around here. You say you've worked with him before, eh? He stops by here about once a week to pick up shipments. No one knows exactly which port he'll land in on any given week, but it's never far from the old Exchange hanger. Most think they're his supplier. More than that, I don't know. He was here about three days ago, so you'll have to wait a while before he comes back."

Dorn smiles as the Zabrak hits the ground. He quickly runs over to his horned victim, taking out his vial of paralytic drops. Moving quickly and deftly puts enough drops into the being's mouth to knock him unconscious. Once that is accomplished, Dorn takes out the mesh tape from his utility belt and goes about tying the Zabrak's hands at the wrists behind his back. Next he ties the ankles. Finally he ties the two together. Once the Zabrak is fully bound, Dorn sits back and rests for a minute.
"You know this is nothing personal," he tells the Zabrak, not really caring that he's unconscious. "This is simply my modus oporandi. You've helped me greatly, now I need you to help me some more."
Dorn reaches out and touches the Zabrak's head. This time he made sure to take his time and go carefully as he entered the being's mind. After sifting through the mind, he begins looking for all the information the creature knows about fixing things.

"Well maybe I wasn't to specific with the Smuggler, his name would be Arken Oyels and his ship would be the Star Skimmer, so unless you know anything about him or learn anything, Ill be heading to the Casino to meet Grudo the Hutt."
Davkas put his attention back to Gisah, noticing that Dorn is now no where to be found.

Assuming you spend a Force point, you're now trained in Mechanics. However, you do not learn anything more from him than what he already told you.
"Hm, you're quite confident aren't you? You see five men with guns pointed at you and you with no weapons of your own. But then, If you are a Sith, you can just strike me with lightning or something, am I right?" Still wearing his confident grin, he motions to his men, who lower their weapons slightly. "Now then, I hear you have something for me?" he asks as he walks towards you.

(1/5 Force Points)
Dorn stands up from the Zabrak and looks down on his latest victim and smiled as he spoke to the unconscious body and put some mesh tape over his mouth.
"You know, I'm getting better at this. I didn't kill you like the last guy. Not too bad I think. Now, unfortunately I can't allow you to live seeing what you know. So...,"
Dorn pulls out his short blade. The lightfoil would be too obvious to anyone who might be following them. He hated to admit it, but Gisah was right. Dorn'd been careless in his previous uses of the Force. For now, at least, he'd have to be more secretive. Dorn hated admitting he'd learned something from that mud soldier.
Still, on to buisness. Stooping over the unconscious Zabrak, he was about to kill the Zabrak when an idea occured to him. Dorn put down the sword and disrobed the Zabrak. He had an idea.
Once the Zabrak's clothes were off and put away, Dorn knelt next to the alien with his short sword in hand. Quickly and repeatedly he thrust his blade into the being's chest. Over and over again, until the creature was dead. Once that was accomplished, Dorn found some material (like a plastic tarp) to wrap the body in. Having done so, Dorn used the Force to lift the body towards the back of the shop. He'd take care of the corpse later.
Once finished, Dorn quickly changed outfits with the clothes the Zabrak had been wearing. Now wearing the clothes of a mechanic, he started cleaning up the blood stains and looking for anything of use in the room. If he was a mechanic now, he might need a tool kit or a security kit.
*Better yet, I think I'll just take inventory of what's available here.*
Dorn set about his new task. After all, the Zabrak **had** said that it'd be a few days till the human showed up.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

You find three tool kits that are still in full working order, and a power recharger that is in fairly decent shape. Also, you now seem to be in possession of a mostly repaired speeder, which the Zabrak had nearly finished working on before his untimely demise.

Dorn figures that he might as well call the others and let them know he's found a safe house for them to stay at. No matter how powerful he is, he isn't strong enough to handle a lot of beings at once. He knows that. That's why he chose the lonely mechanic. Reaching into his ear, Dorn touched the comlink.
"Gisah, Garrak, Davkas. I've found a place to stay for the time being. Let me know where you're at and I'll come get you."
While waiting for the others to return the call, Dorn finishes the repairs on the speeder.

"You will be given your weapons back when you exit the building. Good day, then sir." With that, the Rodian turns and returns to whatever he was doing before you entered.

Dorn cursed not so silently as he slipped in the aluvial damner fluids that had been spilled earlier by the previous mechanic. Before continuing the repairs, he found some towels and began cleaning up the place. Hearing Garrak's response, Dorn touched his ear piece.
"I'm in a repair shop not far from Sokko's Cantina. The others were there too last time I saw them. Meet me there in a few minutes. I'll pick all of you up."
Dorn gets back to work finishing the repairs to the speeder, this time being more careful.

"Well I guess Dorn has either won himself a Speeder in a game of cards or he killed the previous owner....regardless I think since we are almost to the Casino I think it best to meet him later after we speak with the Hutt...."

You see, I just inherited a repair shop and I've noticed that it's systems are out of date. I may know my way around an engine, but not the holonet. I was hoping that I could pay someone to set up a better network for the shop. Do you know anyone around like that?"

"Eh, I can think of a few people who might have the skills you're looking for." He goes about making your drink as he talks. "There's a few who fancy themselves slicers over on those tables back there. But they couldn't slice their way out of Nerf pen, I don't think, eh?" He chuckles as he hands you your drink. "The real slicers on this moon hang out at a friend of mine's place, called Gooro's."

Dorn takes the data pad in his hand and gives it a percursory glance before pocketing it. Looking at the Toydarian he smiles.
"Thank you very much. You've been very helpful."
Walking out of the cantina, Dorn motions for Garrak to get in the speeder with him.
"Gisah and Davkas aren't here. They've moved on to some casino and will meet up with us later. So, unless you've got other plans, we have a few chores that we can get around to. One, we need to fortify our new safe house with some extra security measures. Even if we're only here for a few days, I'd like to have a permanent place set up here for us to come back to, one day. Second, we need to get ourselves a computer expert. While, yes, we could watch the ports every day till our target arrives, we're only *assuming* that he'll show up at the ones your friends mentioned. He could, theoretically show up at any of the ports on the planet. And that's just the ports. So, we need a way of monitoring more of this planet at once. We'll need to set up a computer network that can do that for us. Now, like I said earlier, I've got to dump some trash and then probably head over and get myself a slicer before heading home. You coming?"

Dorn slowly drove around the city looking for an not so conspicuous place to throw his *trash* away. While they drove around, he said,
"That concerns me too. If they know about Force users, they could be sympathizers to the Light side, for all we know. By the way, you didn't let them know about your Force sensitivity, did you?"
Finding a vacant spot next to the edge, Dorn popped the opening to the rear cargo container, and Force lifted the dead body over the abyss before letting it fall. Closing the container, he got back in the speeder and drove towards the more populated sections again."

Garrak replied as Dorn got back into the speeder.
"I had no choice, besides, I got the impression they would have killed me if they thought I was anything but a force user. Their leader seemed to know just how deadly the force can be. He knew he'd be dead right now had he tried anything." Garrak slowed his breathing for a moment to try and discover whether dealing with the Exchange would be helpful at all.

"I'm getting that notion too," Dorn replied while driving through the streets. "Look, we need to go pick someone up for the store. Like I said earlier, we need a slicer. Now, that Toydarian back at the cantina was kind enough to give me this." Dorn hands over the data-pad with the map on it. "It'll get us to a place called Gooro's. Sotto said that the good slicers are there. Want to come along to be my *muscle*? Otherwise I could drop you off at the shop or somewhere along the way."

You don't feel any danger in dealing with the Exchange from the Force.
As you arrive at Gooro's cantina, you immediately notice that it is much nicer and well maintained compared to Sokko's. It is nearly three times the size of the small cantina you just came from. Garak recognizes the Trandoshan and several other people he saw in the Exchange hideout standing near the door. They seem to have just come from the cantina, as they appear drunk and a few are still holding the remnants of their drinks.

Dorn parked the speeder, hopped out, and walked inside the cantina. He spent some time looking around for slicers, probing their emotions in search of one who was fairly confident in their slicing skills.

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-05 14:39:45)

Immediately upon entering, Garak recognizes a rather familiar face. Standing behind the counter of the bar was the Rodian Exchange boss that you met with earlier today. He turns to face you, and says, "Ah, my Felucian friend! Come for a drink or more information?"
Dorn finds only three slicers that merit his attention. One is a Wookie sitting at one of the Sabacc tables. One is another Zabrak, who looks very similar to the one you killed. He sits at the bar, drinking. The last is a Ithorian who sits alone in one of the booths, mostly hidden in the shadows.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **Tempeste** (2009-04-05 14:48:14)

Garrak notices the Rodian and takes a seat at the bar in front of him. "I'll take both." he said in reply to his question, "I'd like to know your business with force users, you seem to know alot about them."

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-05 15:01:44)

Dorn sees the Zabrak drinking and immediately notices the family resemblance. *Hmmm. I guess technical skills run in the family.* He keeps his distance for a second as he asks the barkeep, "One Corellian whiskey and one more of what the Zabrak's having. I'll take it to him, if you don't mind."
With the alcohol in hand, Dorn secretly takes out some knockout drops and puts a strong dose in the Zabrak's glass. Walking over towards the Zabrak, Dorn slides the drink in front of him. "You looked like you might need another. What's got you drinking tonight?"

---

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-05 15:11:56)

The Rodian turns his attention away from Garrak long enough to give Dorn the drinks he asked for, the turns back to the Felucian and says, "I do a lot of business with Force users and their allies. Some of my best clients are the Jedi, but I think their money is running thin. That's why I've been looking to strike some deals with the Sith. I figured whatever you're up to will be a good place to start."
The Zabrak looks up at Dorn, accepting the drink with a grunt. "I came here because my brother promised me a job. My first one since my old gig went south. I get here, ask for directions to his place, and they tell me he's missing. Probably bailed on me like he always did. Dunno why I ever believed him this time." He takes a big shallow of the drink you brought him before looking up at you again. He notices the mechanic's uniform you're wearing and says, "Huh. That looks kinda like what my brother used to wear actually. You work for him or somethin'?"

### **Tempeste** (2009-04-05 15:27:33)

Garrak nodded and smiled a little, "If this goes well then I'm sure the Academy will be interested in forming a more, permanent relationship." Garrak truthully felt that this situation wouldn't go as smoothly as anticipated. He rubbed his hands together, this moon was alot colder than any other planet he'd been too, Felucia, Mustafar and Tatooine all had warm climates. "Do you know the Jedi this, smuggler is in contact with well?"

Dorn looks at the Zabrak and smiles. He describes the Zabrak's appearance to the one at the bar. "Is that the one? Sorry pal. I don't work for him. I acquired his shop from him. He left for somewhere in the great beyond." He waves his hand in the air. "So, you're looking for a job? What happened to your old gig? Also, what do you do? What skills do you have?"
Dorn keeps his eyes on the Zabrak, waiting for the drugs to kick in.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-05 15:36:32)

The Rodian smiles and shakes his head, saying, "Not specifically, no. I've been in contact with the Jedi only by their representatives, like Arken and a few others. The Jedi themselves stay in their secret location that only a few know, and don't even bother to show the galaxy at large their faces. Wise, but still annoying."
The Zabrak continues drinking, growing drowsy on top of intoxicated as he does. "Actually...I used to be a bodyguard." His head drops suddenly, jarring him back into a mostly awake state. "But my real talents...are in computers. I can slice my way around any system you point me at." He takes another drink and starts to try and say something before succumbing to the effects of the drug you slipped into his drink.

Garrak listened as the Rodian spoke and thought for a few moments as he finished. "What need do the Jedi have with the Exchange? They usually spend their time trying to shut your kind down." He turned to notice Dorn talking to the Zabrak, he got the feeling they'd pick up another body soon...

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-05 16:02:03)

You feel it would be prudent to find an safe location before attempting anything.
"I get the feeling the Jedi don't really know or care where their representatives get their goods from. They just know that guys like Arken somehow get their hands on crystals or holocrons, and then give them to the Jedi. If they knew that their primary supplier was the Exchange, they might not be so thrilled, at least at first." the Rodian replies.

---

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **Tempeste** (2009-04-05 16:05:38)

"Holocrons?" The mention of the word had grabbed Garrak's attention moreso than any others, "Do you have any of these, supplies right now?" He glanced over his shoulder again, it looked like the Zabrak was almost unconsious.. "The Academy would appreciate any extra help you provide us with."

Putting his arm around the Zabrak's back, Dorn uses the Force to help him lift his new victim and carry him outside and into a dark ally. Once outside, Dorn uses his mesh tape to tie the Zabrak up completely at the ankles and wrists. Once that is done, Dorn catches his breath from all of his uses of the Force in the past few minutes before grabbing the Zabrak's head.
"You have several somethings I want, from the sound of it, but only one I can take. Maybe I'll let you live once I'm done here." After making sure no one's coming, Dorn grabs the Zabrak's head and carefully peers into it's mind, looking for it's skills in slicing.

"Jedi.. Sith, it's all down to your point of view. Any Holocron you have would be useful. I'm sure I'd make it worth your while if you could even just let me see one." Garrak was certainly interested in obtaining a Holocron, he generally felt the force was much too primal and bestial to be tought through books and scrolls but the wisdom of a great force user could be useful indeed.

Davkas heads over to the Twi'lek, trying to remember if it was the same one that was on the landing pad earlier...but then he was too busy chasing the suicidal Rodian so he can't remember.
"I was told to come meet with Grudo, I have business with him and would very much like to work out a deal with him...if he wouldn't mind meeting with me and my friend as it may be worth his time."

"Hmmmm. This could stand to get a new lock." Dorn turns around and sees the blank look on the Zabrak's face. "Drak, was it? What's the problem? You told me that you could slice your way into any computer system. Is the stuff I asked you for too dificult? Tell you what you can do for me. Run an errand. I'm going to need a new, top of the line lock for this door. I can install it myself, but I don't have the parts here. So, you run out and get it for me while I try my luck at that computer. Maybe the night air will do you some good."
Dorn thinks back to the information he stole from Drak's brother as to how much a new lock would cost and give's Drak the money. As the Zabrak walked out, Dorn set down at the computer. *One job at a time.* He started working on slicing his way into the moon's ship landing system. He needed to set up a watcher program that would keep him abreast of all of the ships that landed on the small moon.

You can't seem to recall at the moment what the lock is likely to cost. The computer work, however, goes much better.

After a considerable period of time, you successfully slice into the system of the entire moon. About the time you finish, Drak returns with a electronic lock in hand. "I had to pay a bit more than you gave me. It ending up being four hundred credits total." he says, handing you the lock. He looks at you as if expecting you to pay him back for the three hundred he's out, but not specifically saying such.

Dorn does not feel that Drak is lying.
The unknown speaker does not seem to be nearby anymore, as Gisah cannot see him. While he does hear plenty of people talking with each other, none of their conversations seem interesting in the least.
The Hutt laughs again, causing his whole body to shake.

I need the Exchange boss who runs this moon dead. His name is Kerrik Sullgo, a Quarren. He will be difficult to meet, and thus kill, so I will give you the generous time limit of three days. Now leave, and do not return without Sullgo's head.

Davkas wondered about the "good" that removing the Hutt would bring as the Exchange would still be there to take the Hutts place.
"I would have to agree with you, but after we get the smuggler and his supposed Jedi friends I think it best to do the same to the Exchange Boss as we do to the Hutt."
Davkas sighs as he waits for Dorn to respond
"At least by removing them both we can say we did good from many perspectives I suppose."
Davkas looks back at the Casino and wonders about what "Guards" the Hutt may have.
"So how many guards do you think we will have to deal with?"

"I couldnÂ´t care less what criminal syndicate runs this rotten moon, my point was that if we turn around now, we had made the number of Hutts in the Galaxy decrease by one. And that in itself is a good deed"
Gisah casts a glance back towards the casino, sliding his lightsaber from his belt into his hand.
"I suppose there will be many more than we saw, the slime most likely has half that casinos patronage working for him"
He starts to walk back towards the casino, not caring to wait for the others.

Taking out the extra money, Dorn handed the rest to Drak, mentioning, "Good job. Tell you what. I'm about to head out to pick up my other partners. Come on. I could use an extra pair of eyes. Or, can you drive? Because I'm terrible at it."

"I am not Sith. I just happen to have a lightsaber and a few questions for your boss"
Carefully applying a slight pressure around the mans throat, he removes the lightsaber from his belt and presses the deactivated handle into his opponents guts.

The Twi'lek, fearing for his life, complies, and opens the door for you. However, the sea of blasters pointed at you is still there, and one of the mob, a human, steps forward to address you. "There's something you seem not to understand, Sith. Your kind aren't welcome around here. In fact, there's a reward in store for anyone who brings in a Sith corpse. So you can see where we might not be willing to just let you go on your way."

For a moment, Gisah thought about dashing into the HuttÂ´s chambers, forcing the slime to call of his hounds at the point of a lightsaber, but then he changed his mind. A quick scan revealed seven opponents. While the thugs certainly were no match one by one, the numbers could make this encounter a challenge indeed.

The man attacked by Gisah is decapitated as easily as Davkas's opponent was killed. However, not about to give up, the remaining six take aim. The first shot narrowly misses Gisah, but the second and third shots get through, nailing him in his side and shoulder. Three more shots go Davkas's way, the first two going completely wild, but the third nicks his ear.

Dorn lets a small smile creep over his lips as he targets the turrets at his victims. He targets one turret each at the two guards in front of the Hutt, and the other two set for auto-fire (if possible) at the crowd gathered at the door. That would only leave 4 more for the mud-soldiers, but he doesn't want to risk damaging such nice weaponry just yet. Once he had his targets, Dorn let loose a volley of blaster bolts, burning flesh and blood of his victims.

Your second attack kills on of the turret operators near to door, and renders the other, who was across from him, unconscious. By now you can hear the Hutt screaming in Huttese. Apparently the translation droid was destroyed or disabled, as no translation follows.

Dorn steps away from the computers and heads in the room with his allies.
"Subtlety has it's place. So does brute force. Why don't the rest of you finish cleaning up while I have a talk with our host here."
Dorn walks towards the giant worm, a smile creeping over his face.
Stopping out of reach of the worms giant hands and tail, Dorn looked up at the slug.
"So, tell me what you know about Arken Oyels. And you should know that I'm not a patient man."

He looked over at the Hutt though. It would be interesting to see how this turned out.

The Hutt's reply is in Huttese, so none of you understand it. But all of your understand his annoyed tone, indicating a reply somewhat akin to "Screw you." Meanwhile, the remaining two guards attempt to sneak by you, but Dorn, Gisah, and Garrak all notice them. Davkas remains oblivious.

Reaching down into the Force, Dorn stretched out his hand and let loose a bolt of stunning energy, intent on crippling the Hutt without killing him. After all, draining the Hutt's brain would work better if it were unconscious.

Looking around at his colleagues, "I mean, to **our** will."
With that, Dorn rests for the minute or so he needs to to be at full strength, then he reaches out and touches the Hutt's head and begins to carefully sift through the Hutt's mind, looking for information on Arken Oyels.

Dorn's search leads him to discover the Hutt's full plan. It seems that Arken Oyels is somewhat of a celebrity in this sector of Nar Shadda, and the Exchange had been profiting greatly from his employ. The Hutt wanted that profit for himself. His plan was to have Kerrik Sullgo, the Exchange leader on the moon. He had hoped the the ensuing confusion would be enough to swoop in and convince Arken that he was the better choice for a business partner. Of course, if it wasn't, he could always assassinate more of the Exchange leadership. It also seems this Hutt was not the oldest or smartest of the Hutts in the galaxy. One of the more successful in this sector of Nar Shadda, however.

Davkas walks past the Speeder.
"I'm going to walk around awhile....clear my head and maybe feel less annoyed by our "controlled reptilian* in the group."
Davkas heads off, not in any particular direction with his mind going through the events of the last couple years and especially today...was he starting to regret it or was he starting to understand what it truly was to be a monster..

Gisah donÂ´t turn to look at Davkas as he answers.
"I never said anything about killing him. I said "remove", which can mean so much more. Besides, it doesnÂ´t matter. I donÂ´t kill a defenseless being, not even one as disgusting as a Hutt. Unlike our "friend", who apparently dare not even face someone unless they are bound or unconscious, I appreciate a challenge. I know myself well enough to know that IÂ´ll survive. And unlike you, I do not fear the Hutt sending his associates after us, I would have gladly accepted the challenge"
Watching the man walk away, Gisah thought to himself.
*At least that one seems to have some honor in him…*

Looking at Davkas walking away, Dorn hopped back out of the speeder. Turning to Drak, "Take Gisah and Garrak back to the shop if they want. If they don't want a lift, just head back and find something useful to do. I'll make my own way back."
Turning towards Gisah, Dorn didn't bother hiding himself or his true power. He simply looked the reptile in the eyes, albeit he was looking *up* to do it. "Honor, if that was your concern, Gisah, is for the dead and defeated. Power is all that matters in this universe. The power to ensure your own survival and to bend the universe to your will. That is all that matters." Turning away he began walking after Davkas, but not before mentioning over his shoulder, "Oh, and if you want to see what I do with those who *can* put up a fight, ... **anytime**." He finishes his statement by raising his hands to either side.
Catching up with Davkas, Dorn didn't look at him, but just started talking. (Taking 10 on Empathy). "I can feel that you're slightly disturbed by what just happened back there, Davkas. You seem to think that we're here to remove unsavory elements from this moon. Do you not realize that we ourselves are unsavory elements? We are predators, Davkas. It is as simple as that. We hunt, we prey, we kill. That is who we are. The sooner you realize this, accept it, and move **with** it instead of against it, the happier and more powerful you will be."
Stopping in front of Davkas to make sure he was listening, Dorn looked him in the eye. "I could show you, if you wanted. It is remarkably easy to let go of this self doubt and feelings of guilt. They just slow you down in the end. What do you say?" Dorn finishes by extending a hand towards Davkas.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-04-15 16:48:05)

Still in his own thoughts, Gisah faces Dorns eyes.
"Do you really think I care what *you* of all beings think of me? Or what you think of honor for that matter? But if you must know, I have the power to ensure my own survival, and I donÂ´t have to practice that power on every worthless being that comes along just to ensure myself of that fact. You believe power to master the universe is the ultimate? I believe that the ability to master yourself is the only thing worth pursuing"
Watching the other walk away, he didnÂ´t even care about the threat.
"You are not worthy of my time. But stay out of my head or maybe IÂ´ll make an exception"
Hardly being able to stand the prescense of the disgusting being, he jumped into the speeder.

Davkas at first tries to shake off what Dorn is saying. He doesn't know exactly how powerful Dorn is but he knew he was an aspiring Sith Lord...he talks about power and being the predator as any True Sith would.
As Dorn stops in front of him and after his words and the extension of his hand, Davkas instinctively grabs his lightsaber and ignites, it ignoring the onlooking people as they stare and pass by.
"I am not a Predator, I am a Soldier....I simply do what is expected of me, whether I like it or not. You live under a delusion of what it is to be a Sith I think, you may be strong now but there will be a time when someone comes and strikes you down and you will be forgotten like all the Sith before you and the rest of us..."
Davkas switches his lightsaber off before stepping off to the side
"...I'm only here because it is what is expected of me, I am not a Predator and I am not Prey."
Davkas continues his walk of solitude simply letting the Force guide him to where he should be or until he finds himself at a Cantina for a Drink.

Seeing Davkas walk off in a huff, Dorn smiled at him.
*We are all either predator or prey. There is no other option. If you will not be a predator at my side, you will be my prey instead. The time may come when there can only be one of us left standing in this group. I have had no indication from the Force that that time has come yet, but when it does, I can assure you that I will be at the top of the pile, with the bones of my enemies forming the foundation of a new empire. At my side or under my feet, whichever allows you to live with yourself, Davkas. It is your choice.*
Dorn turned and started walking back towards the shop. He needed to check the logs and see if his *current* prey had shone up yet.

Looking the alien dead in the eyes, "You know, we may have to kill them. Their weakness could endanger us.

"That depends. Who are *you* and what do you want here? If we can reach an accord, then perhaps we can help each other."

"You can call me Mek. These two," he says as he points to the two who's faces are uncovered, "Are Seran and Dormo. The guy in the hood calls himself 'The Seer,' because of his Force powers." As he says this, the hooded man turns to Mek and seems to be angry at him.

Mek is about to speak when 'the Seer' puts his hand on the Nautolan's shoulder and steps forward. "It is too late to hide your Force presence, Sith. I sensed you the moment we entered this building."
Upon hearing this, Mek angrily turns toward the hooded man and says, "You sensed something like that and didn't tell me!?"

Garak hears the clicking of the two humans behind him raising their weapons. The Seer raises his hand, warning the two to back off. "There is no such thing as 'safe' for one such as I. However, simple bounty hunters pose no threat to me." As he says this, he performs a sudden backflip over Garak's head, and in the next instant the Felucian feels something pressing against his back.

The weapon flies into the Felucian's hand, and he realizes it is a lightsaber. The Seer turns his shadowed face towards Dorn. "I am neither Jedi nor Sith. I belong to no Force Tradition, nor do I have an affiliation. I am the one who cannot see, yet watches all. I am the Seer, and the Force has guided our two destinies to meet."

Garrak glanced at the lightsaber before turning to face the Seer.
"You believe in destiny when you watch all, I guess you're too ignorant to see the truth at least. And you're not Jedi or Sith yet you use a Lightsaber? Then you're either lying, or you stole this from someone's corpse." Garrak looked down at the saber again, igniting it to see the colour of the blade.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-25 09:45:29)

The blade of the now ignited saber is an extremely rare black color. As Garrak is igniting the blade, the Seer says, "Ignorance? Is it ignorance to believe in that which you have seen? I have watched destiny's path through history, and I came to the inevitable conclusion that the Force has a will all its own. And from that will, it dictates the destiny of every living being."

"Who exactly are you?" He asked whilst unigniting the lightsaber and placing it on his twisted, rancor hide belt, "I have no destiny, and neither will you unless you remove my *ignorance* and asnwer the question." He continued in a harsh tone. This Seer was intriguing and the black saber, definately something that could strike fear moreso than a red one, he'd keep it.

"Then you die." He finished calmly, whilst summoning strength from the force and launching a bal of compressed, sickening air towards the seer.

He then flicked it on, the crimson blade illuminating his face in a red glow.

Two, killing the lot of you will gain me some benefit in the future. Three, something else I haven't seen yet. However, since I don't know which one it is, I'd rather not have anyone die at the moment. At least, not until I know which path to take. However, I will not allow my allies to suffer.

There is an audible crack as Mek's body drives his comrades hard into the floor. Mek appears to be only dazed, but the other two look dead.
Drak nods at Dorn's command, and focuses the turret's aim on the three prone forms.
"Anything, you say? I feel your confidence is rather misplaced." With that, the Seer turns to Dorn and says, "Yes, there is much I could teach you. For that is why the Force has guided me here. I have seen your path and mine are intertwined. We share a bond, you and I. Our extraordinary command over the Force, and our ambition to use it."

All I got from the Force was that that meeting would be profitable for me. That doesn't mean that this Seer is completely trustworthy. He could be clouding my understanding of the Force. However, if there's the chance for power, I'm going to take it. I'm well aware that we're being watched by the masters. They would undoubtedly want us to look into this Force user.

Davkas makes his way through the alley he had walked through before when he reached the Casino.
His eyes go back and forth as he look around trying to catch any glimpse of an ambush of of Dorn and the others. He was starting to wonder if it had been best to not call them and let them know he was coming.
Davkas makes his way to the Casino entrance still looking around before he enters to look to see if his so called companions were waiting inside.

Too riled up in the combat, Gisah hardly notices the shots hitting him, even though he knows it can be dangerous to ignore them. Swinging around to gain momentum, he brings his lightsaber up into an overhand chop and then brings it down towards the Kel Dor. After all, he only needs one of them alive.

As the Kel Dor's head splits open beneath the powerful blow of Gisah's saber. As it does, the human, terrified, runs away, dropping his gun as he does.
Davkas notices Dorn and Garrak in the speeder, about to leave.

Blinking as some of the blood - at least he thinks it is blood, it might be something else as well - splatters in his face, Gisah notices the last of the thugs dropping his weapon in panic and running away. The battleraged Chistori isnÂ´t about to let him get away though, and dashes off after him, striking to capture, not to kill this time.
((Not sure what action combination will be required, but IÂ´ll use Run(Full Round), Move+Charge(Move+Standard) or whatever to catch up with him and tackle him))

You bring your lightsaber's hilt down on the man's head, rendering him unconscious. As he falls to the ground, you hear footsteps approaching in the distance.

Hissing as he feels some of the pain he had subdued in the heat of combat, Gisah heaves the fallen man onto his shoulder, and looks around for some place to vanish into and observe whoever is coming. Keeping his deactivated lightsaber in his hand, the Sith Apprentice leaves the bloody scene. He suspects the man will be out for at least a few minutes, but he keeps an eye on him, ready to muffle his mouth should he wake up and try to make any sounds.

Mere moments after Gisah ducks behind a pile of crates, three more men, two of them dressed in the same armor as the now dead thugs, round the corner and take in the bloody scene before them. One, a black-clothed human with a hood shadowing his face, makes a motion to the other two. They respond by walking off in opposite directions, weapons drawn. The black-robed human remains staring at the dead bodies. Once the other two are out of earshot, however, he turns his face towards Gisah's hiding spot. "You can come out now, reptile."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-10 09:48:22)

Taken a bit by surprise that the man seemed to be calling out to him completely unarmed, Gisah wasnÂ´t about to get fooled by it though. He knew that there were several types of beings in the Galaxy that didnÂ´t need weapons to defend themselves, and Force users where only one of them.
Sliding forth a roll of mesh tape, Gisah quickly bound his unconscious prisoners hands and feet, and covered his mouth. Once he was done, he slid his lightsaber into his hand in a reversed manner that left it partially hidden by his palm. Not because he expected to hide it from the man, but mainly because it was a style of combat he preferred.
Rising up from his hiding place, he started to walk forward towards the man, scanning around for the two thugs he had arrived with, or anything else that might be threatening.
"So, and who might you be then?"

The man pulls his robe aside, revealing the lightsaber hilt on his belt. "I am the Killer. Or so I call myself. You, my reptilian friend, have attracted the interest of some very powerful beings. I am one of their many messengers."

---

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-12 07:32:46)

Gisah did not appear very impressed with the mans claims.
"And what do others call you? And who might these powerful beings be? Certainly Exchange thugs would be smarter than to make such claims..."

The man shakes his head, saying, "No, that's not how it works. You don't get to know anything like that until you've proven yourself."

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-12 18:15:24)

Gisah smiles.
"I guess you wouldnÂ´t say that unless you had something to back that up with. But before I decide to prove anything for you, might I ask why it would be in my interest to have anything to do with you?"

---

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-05-12 18:28:14)

"Because I offer you the one thing you crave above all else. Power!" Just then, the two Exchange thugs come back into view. With a shout of surprise, they raise their weapons at you. But before they can fire, the Killer snaps both of their necks with the Force. "You see?"

---

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-12 18:39:15)

Gisah watched the mans display of power, without showing any spectacular interest.
*So he is just one of them…*
Still, he felt that it might be an unnecessary provocation to insult the man, and besides, he might have something to learn from him after all.
"I might not be as impressed as you want me to be, but you caught my interest Killer. So, tell me more"

---

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-05-12 18:54:51)

"Well...the best way to learn is by doing, after all..." The Killer removes the lightsaber hilt from his belt, and ignites it, revealing its black blade. "Come. Let us see what kind of strength you possess. Then I can judge what you are to be told."

---

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-13 10:10:03)

"Very well"
Gisah offered a small nod, a symbol of warriors honor to the man, as he snapped his lightsaber into life. He wondered a little curiously about the otherÂ´s black blade, and what would make his blade appear like that. He wasnÂ´t in his prime, still weary from the earlier challenges he had met during the day, but he wasnÂ´t going to let that stop him. Drawing a deep breath, he started into a slow-paced stride towards his opponent, but as he approached, he quickened his steps, and called upon all the secrets he had learned form the Keetael to use the Force to increase his momentum. At the peak of his motion, he swung himself into a spin, bringing his lightsaber in a horizontal slash towards his opponents side.

Mere moments before your lightsaber makes contact with his flesh, the Killer brings up his own saber, battering yours aside. As he does, he says, "Impressive momentum and strength. But if that is all, you are no match for me." With that, he swings down his own saber, cutting from your shoulder down to your side. "I can see you have much yet to learn. But I can also see potential for a great destiny ahead of you."

Gisah grinned in pain as the black blade raked his side. Taking a few steps backwards, he deactivated his lightsaber and looked at the man.
"A warrior must know his limits and bounds, because that is the only way to overcome them. And it seems I have reached mine. You are strong, and had I not been weary from earlier fights I might have been able to offer greater resistance, but as of now it seems pointless"
Biting down the last jolt of pain he replaced the weapon at his belt, and straightened.
"I would, however, be most interested in knowing what you can teach me"

---

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-05-13 10:50:22)

The black lightsaber swings out, as if to decapitate you. Just before contact is made, however, the blade deactivates. "The first thing I can teach you is to never let your guard down. Had I been your enemy, you would be dead now. But I suspect such a possibility has not escaped you." With that the Killer turns and begins to walk away. "You would do well to meet with your comrades now. They will have met with my brother by now. They will explain what you are to do now. Tell them I will wait with my brother. Until then...don't die." With that, he vanishes into the shadows.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-13 13:59:31)

Gisah watched the man depart. Of course he had known that lowering his guard was a foolish thing to do, and that in the face of a true enemy, he would have been dead. But he had had a feeling that the other would not strike him down, and if that feeling had been wrong, he knew that he would not have been able to fight him off. He knew when he had met his match.
Returning to his prisoner, he checked to see if the man was awake yet. He had some things to tell him before he returned to the others.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **zenkatarn** (2009-05-13 14:51:36)

The man begins to stir, awakened by the noise. At first he just groans, but before long he's struggling against his bonds and attempted to shout at you despite his covered mouth.

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-13 15:26:45)

Gisah sighed. He wasnÂ´t sure his patience would last if this one put up a fight as well. He placed his hand firmly around the mans throat.
"Listen very closely now. I am wounded, and I am tired, but I can quite easily turn you into just another stain on the ground, just like the rest of your pals. I have had a change of plans, so IÂ´m going to leave you be now. Hopefully someone will find you, sooner than later. But the next time we meet, I will expect you not to raise a weapon against me, and suggest to your friends to do the same. I will be coming back to speak to your boss, and I better get to see him, do you understand?"
Not really waiting for an answer, he gave the man a smack over the head with the back of his palm, sending him back into unconsciousness, and pulled out his comlink.
"Garrak, Dorn, Davkas, where are you? Would you mind picking me up, I heard you have made a new acquaintance and received new orders"

## Re: Episode II: The Hunt

Dorn pulls up the navigator on the speeder and points to the spot on the map.
