# [Path's of Corruption] Episode I: Sunset (concluded)

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-15 13:12:36)

It is the Dark Century...
The Sith Legion's rule has spread across the galaxy, and the Jedi are all but wiped out. It is in this climate of fear and darkness that your journey begins.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Welcome to the Paths of Corruption.**</span>
"So you pathetic whelps are our latest recruits?" A tall, imposing Feeorin paces in front of the eight fresh Initiates. His dark yellow skin is covered in scars and wounds from old battles, which he shows in an obvious attempt to intimidate you. He smirks confidently, twirling his lightsaber by his side as he speaks. "I am Zyne, and though I am not a Dark Lord, I *am* lord of this academy. And you will address me as such. Your time here will be neither pleasant nor in any way safe. You will be at constant risk of death in a million different ways. However, should you survive, you will become a powerful member of the Sith Legion. Some of you may become Sith Warriors, able to utterly decimate any opponent with the lightsaber. Some may become Sith Warlocks, able to use the Dark Side of the Force to do most anything imaginable. Some might choose the path of the Sith Stalker, able to move unseen and unheard, and strike from the shadows. And some of you may even grow to become Dark Lords, second only to the Emperor himself." Zyne pauses, letting each student think on his words before continuing. "But most of you will become something else entirely. Most of you will become **dead**!"
Zyne stops pacing in front of the doorway leading into the academy, facing you. "Choose well which of these you wish to be. Because there will be no one to hold your hand in the Legion." He returns his saber to its place on his belt, and steps to the side. "That is all the orientation you get from me. You are free to look around the academy or whatever else you may wish to do until morning. You will be expected to be on time to all of your classes. If you are late...well...just don't be late," he says with a cruel sneer. He then gestures to the door, indicating that you may enter.

Garrak looked at those around him.
*Five, maybe six will be dead by the end of the week*
He headed towards the door, his skullblade slung on his back and a lightsaber at his waist. The luminous tips of his tentacles glowed as he walked.

Dorn kept his face calm, but sneered inwardly.
*Not even a Sith Lord. How pathetic he must be that the only honor he can give himself would be to try and intimidate new recruits.*
Looking around at his classmates/ future victims, Dorn knew he would have to tread carefully until he found out who were the truly dangerous students. Then he would have to kill them in their sleep. First, though, he made his way towards the archives, where he knew the real power lay. He planned to spend most of his first night in the academy studying the archives in search of old wisdom.

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-15 14:26:20)

One of the other students, a Selkath, dashes for the open door, desperate to get away from the heat of Mustafar's surface. He makes his way immediately to the food hall, where he begins drinking water like there's no tomorrow.
The Cather that follows him in giggles to herself, enjoying his suffering as a true Sith should. She makes for the saber training hall, eager to begin her training.
A Zabrak in dark clothes steps in line, entering the building. His metal gauntlets make a scraping sound as their claws run across the stone of the doorway. Considering his options, he decides to find his quarters, intending to meditate.
A man with a very insane grin could be noted walking the opposite direction of the rest of the group. He chooses not to enter the building, but instead pulls out his blaster rifle and sets out hunting the native creatures.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-15 14:42:59)

Gisah listened intently to the man that would apparently be his superior for some time to come. Or at least until one of his students surpassed him. Gisa knew little of the true ways of the Sith, but he knew that one only remained in power as long as you was the strongest. An experienced hunter, Gisah was well aware of his strengths and weaknesses. He could tear a wild beast apart using nothing but a primitive blade, but he was also very conscious about the fact that his skill in using the Force, and particularly its darker sides, was still feeble. Yet, in time, that would change.
Intrigued by what secrets might be hidden within archives as ancient as those surely found at a Sith academy, he started to make his way towards the archives.

Dawntracker stood at attention during "Lord" Zyne's speech, as all Sith Troopers would to their Superior, but Dawntracker was unsure as to why he was there.
As the other initiates went their separate ways Dawntracker tried to measure up his fellow "students". Knowing he hasn't ever really used the Force before, he couldn't be sure of their abilities compared to his own, but then the Force can't save you all the time as he had seen on several occasions.
Dawntracker decided it best to introduce himself to "Lord" Zyne as was his training to address the Superior on site. Dawntracker walks over to Zyne and salutes him.
"Lord Zyne, I am Lance Corporal Davkas Dawntracker Sir, I am here to serve as ordered..."
~Perhaps the Headmaster knows more of why I was sent here, as I am still a bit hazy from it all.~

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-15 15:14:33)

Zyne smiles as the man salutes him. "Not any more you're not. Now you are Davkas Dawntracker, Sith Initiate. You are no mere soldier anymore. You are here to train in the Dark Side of the Force. You will learn to wield a lightsaber, and bend the Force to your will. And by the end of it, if you survive that long, you will be a true Sith."

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-15 15:35:12)

Dawntracker didn't let it show but now he knew he was knee deep in it now.
~Save a Sith Lord and get sent to the academy because your Sensitive....Great.~
"Very Lord Zyne, I shall do as is expected of me or I will earn the rewards of my failure."
~Great going Dawntracker, guess if your gonna survive you best make an ally of some sort here.~
Dawntracker notices the man who went off with the Blaster Rifle and decides to follow him, as the man didn't appear to have a Lightsaber but then maybe the creatures here would help give Dawntracker an edge to surviving the other "creatures" here.....or end his misery much quicker.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-15 15:41:20)

"Range: Optimal. Wind: Negligible. Target: Locked." The man mutters to himself, just before firing off a shot from the heavy blaster rifle he carried. The shot is dead on, and his target, a large, reptilian creature, falls into a lava flow. "Perfect. Jarg, one, alien planet, zero." As he stands, he notices Davkas following him. He draws his sidearm and points it at his fellow student. "What do you want? Why'd you follow me?"

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-15 15:44:39)

Garrak heads to find his room. He didn't desire a conversation with any here, he could sense their weakness.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-15 15:51:47)

Dawntracker pauses as the man "Jarg" points his Blaster at him, Dawntracker puts his hand up showing no intention of threat and slowly removes his helmet and brings it to his side.
"Well first I was gonna tell you great shot, but now that your aiming at me perhaps I better hope it was a lucky shot....."
Dawntracker steps back a bit just encase the Man fires he might be able to dodge it and pull out his own Rifle.
".....That and you didn't seem like the typical Force user like the rest of them, so I assumed we might have a bit in common."

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-15 15:57:50)

Jarg tilts his head to the side slightly, considering what the man in front of him just said. Then he smiles, slightly more friendly than before, and twirls his pistol before re-holstering it. "Oh, right then. You're right, I don't know thing one about this 'Force' thing of theirs. I'm just here because I was promised POWER!" His smile begins to grow more insane as he speaks, even as he inspects his rifle. It becomes increasingly clear that he is obsessed with maintaining it in perfect condition. "And you? How'd they get you here? What's your deal?"

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-15 16:13:01)

Dawntracker sighs a bit as the situation seemed to die down and at the thought of why was he here.
"I saved my Superior, a Sith Lord from being killed so I am here as a reward of sorts....some reward huh?"
Dawntracker grins, as it was kinda of a joke but more of cynical remark to his current situation.
"So your after Power?....Well I suppose your already got the Mentality for this place, me I am here to Survive and I intend too no matter what I am up against...."
Dawntracker decides to try his luck, he had had men in his command like this Jarg before so he had an idea of what to expect, if all else fails he knows that Jarg would be one to go out shooting.
"..So Jarg was it? Seeing as Power and Survival tend to go together quite often, how about we "assist" each other with our goals, if you catch my drift?"

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-15 16:21:09)

Jarg looks at Dawntracker as though he was out of his mind. After a few moments silence, he bursts out laughing. As he begins to slow his laughter, he looks again at Davkas and seems to realize he's serious. "You...wha? How do you expect me to gain power if I'm held back by someone like you? Didn't you ever hear the phrase, 'Those who ask for mercy deserve none?'" Jarg snorts in contempt, and returns his attention to his rifle.

Dorn made it to the academy archives. As he entered the doors, he wondered briefly what kind of media he'd find on the molten planet of Mustafar. It didn't seem to make sense to use flimsiplast, but maybe data rods or data disks?
As he walked, Dorn begun casting his awareness around himself through the Force, intending to make sure he was never caught by surprise.

Dorn notices only one other living being in the room, and no other items of interest. The other living being is directly behind you, coming down the stairs.

Grabbing some scrolls that looked like they had been written by Freedon Nadd, Dorn decided that he wasn't ready yet to meet whoever else might be interested in the archives. Dorn knew that he wasn't a fighter, not in the traditional sense. Better to sit in the shadows and to not be noticed, thus gathering information and deciding how to best gain power over one's enemies. Taking his precious scrolls, Dorn walked out of the archives and towards his room, intending on spending the night in study.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-15 17:11:18)

Dawntracker realizes he made a mistake now, this Jarg was not the sort he had thought...Jarg was far worse...the one who would plan it out to kill you, a perfectionist...a professional killer.
Dawntracker had to make a choice now, Jarg has seen weakness in him and would most likely plan him out as his first target...or tell the others of his plans for seeking an ally...the only suitable choice would be to convince him otherwise, which was most unlikely as Dawntracker was not much of a Bluffer or to remove him as a threat for the better good for himself.
Dawntracker puts his Helmet back on and reaches for one of his CryoBan Grenades.
Dawntracker takes his CryoBan Grenades, arms it and tosses it at the base of Jargs Footing then pulls out Blaster Rifle to finish the job.

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-15 19:51:01)

Jarg had been anticipating the possibility of an attack, and had his rifle already primed and ready to retaliate. However, before he got a chance, the grenade headed his way stopped heading his way. In fact, it flew in the opposite direction...and into the hand of Lord Zyne.
Zyne approached the two students, grenade in hand, with a slight frown evident on his face. "What's this now? Students aiming for each other before even spending a day here?" Zyne's tone had a hint of humor to it. "We can't have that, now can we?" He tosses the grenade back to Dawntracker, awaiting his no doubt entertaining reply.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-15 20:15:07)

Dawntracker didn't account on Zyne interfering, but then of course when it comes to Sith its usually the unexpected that kills you.
Dawntracker reattached his Grenade to his belt then stood at attention towards Zyne and thought of the only answer he knew would be acceptable.
"This "Jarg" stated that he didn't consider me a threat, Lord Zyne, I thought it best to correct his assumption."
Dawntracker also realized he had failed to kill Jarg, which could be punishable.
"I accept my punishment for my failure, Lord Zyne."
Dawntracker figures he is not gonna like whatever else was coming his way.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-15 20:22:36)

Without warning, Zyne burst into a very loud laugh. "Most commendable, Dawntracker. Jarg, have you been properly corrected?"
Jarg smiles crazily, saying with a shrug, "Yeah. He acted much faster then I had guessed." He returns his rifle to its place on his back.
Zyne nods. "Right then, no punishment will be necessary, provided you do not attempt to further prove your point." With that, he walks off.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-15 20:40:33)

Dawntracker now begins to understand more of what they expected here, there was a part of him that wished it was not like this to survive but then what else was there but the Dark Reality of it all.
Dawntracker regain his thought as Zyne walks away, he figures it be best to enter the school now.
He decides to put the ordeal out of his mind but knows form now on he will have to watch Jarg, as he would most likely be watching him.
Dawntracker enters the front and decides to grab something to eat before he heads to his quarters, perhaps one of the other students would be more "helpful".

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-15 20:55:28)

The Selkath student is still in the cafeteria when Dawntracker walks in. He turns to look at the human as he enters, but ignores him immediately afterward. After drinking the last of his water, he stands, walking towards the doorway.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-15 21:05:44)

On his way down to the archives, Gisah meets a human male moving past him out of the archives, leaving with a couple of scrolls in his arms. Throwing a curious eye after the man, Gisah enters the archives and begins to search for the information he is seeking.
He may not know much about Sith Lore and such, but he does remember hearing about a Dark Lord of the past named Marka Ragnos, who had been strong both to the body and with the Force. And another one, called Ajunta Pall, who had been the greatest blademaster among the Sith, and who had crafted a dark blade of enormous powers.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-15 21:08:54)

As Dorn exists the archives, he is stopped by a Quarren in a Sith Master robe. "No materials are to be taken out of the archives," he states threateningly.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-15 21:26:11)

Dorn stops short when he comes face to face with the Quarren in master robes. Noting the robes and the manner of speech, Dorn decided that the master probably was what he appeared to be. Dorn also knew that the only way to find out for certain, at least for now, would be to challenge him. And, if Dorn were wrong, it would turn out badly. Instead, Dorn bowed deeply to the Quarren.
"My apologies, master. I am new here and didn't yet know the regulations. How wise of you to keep the records all in one place, thus preventing the loss of such important records as these. I will return them immediately."
Turning and retreating down the stairs, Dorn began racking his mind to find a way to get the information from the scrolls out of the archives. He understood that knowledge was power, and he planned on having **all** the power.
Maybe this master would have to die one day too.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-15 21:42:36)

Dawntracker eats his fill though he was being cautious of the food, not sure whether or not one of the student had gotten the bright idea to poison any of it.
Dawntracker leans back in the chair thinking
~Well what to do now...I could go train with a lightsaber...if I had one....hmmm maybe I should find a Holocron, Darth Sinin was looking for those as I recall~
Dawntracker stand up having decided that maybe a Holocron would give him some sort of clue as to how use the force, otherwise he was gonna be as worse off for not knowing.
With that thought in mind Dawntracker made his way to the Archives, figuring perhaps one would be there, or someone would know where to find one.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-16 07:56:36)

After resting in his room for a few minutes, Garak decides to see if he can discover exactly what kind of power this place had in store. He decides to look for the Academy Lord's chambers to try and stealthily take a look inside.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-16 17:03:05)

Replacing some of the scrolls, Dorn spent his time looking over a scroll written by the great Sith Lord Naga Sadow and gave some description of a Sith Warship called the Corsair, which contained a weapon of great power. This was the kind of thing that Dorn had no intention of sharing with his fellow students. This was the power of the Dark Side of the Force. And he would attempt to make it his alone. Walking amongst the scrolls, and making sure that no one was around, Dorn hid the scroll amongst the others until such a time as he could later retrieve it and take it for his own collection.
Checking to see if anyone else had noticed him, Dorn exited the archives, confident in his first secret from his fellow Sith.
(Take a 10 on a Stealth check to hide the scroll.)
(Take a 20 on a Perception check to make sure no one saw him do it.)

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-16 17:09:10)

The Quarren Master from before makes a sound not unlike a human cough, indicating his presence to Dorn. "May I ask what you are doing with my scrolls?" He pulls out the poorly hidden scroll, holding it in front of Dorn accusingly.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-16 17:18:56)

Realizing that he'd been caught trying to secret away the scroll, Dorn decided it might be best to simply confront the issue.
"Knowledge is Power, Master. I assume that you are the archivist, as you say the scroll is yours. If this is true, then you understand the nature of Power, and you've also read enough of the great lords of the past to know that Power does not do well when it is shared. I was attempting to make sure that I had access to Knowledge that my fellow students did not. I do not intend on sharing Power, Master. That is not the way of the Sith."
He looked up at the Quarren Sith Lord, expecting some sort of rebuttal or even a punishment for attempting to secret information from the archives. Though, he mostly was upset at being caught. He would have to do better.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-16 17:24:16)

"Interesting. However, if that were true, surely the best course of action would be to burn the scroll after memorizing its contents, yes? Furthermore, if you were going to hide it, would it not be far wiser to attempt to sneak it out of the achieves and hide it in your room? Or better, somewhere no one would think to look for it? Hiding something in plain sight is *not* so good a tactic as some might have you believe." Here the Quarren pauses, waiting to hear how Dorn will reply.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-16 17:34:12)

Dorn listens to the Quarren's response, and realizes that he has possibly found a master he does **not** want to kill, ... yet.
"Master, you previously caught me attempting to secret scrolls from your archives. Why would I attempt the same feat twice in the exact same manner, expecting a different result? In truth, many things **can** be hidden in plain sight without their being noticed. Who would notice one odd scroll amongst so many? That would give me another opportunity to sneak down here in the middle of the night and steal it at that juncture, when most other students and masters would be asleep. Then, I could hide it in my room until such time as I had made a copy of it and returned it here, no one being the wiser. That would allow me to study its mysteries at my leisure without being caught."
*Actually,* Dorn thought, *I could then replace it with a false scroll. Thus I could lead my fellow Siths down false paths of power, leaving myself with the **true** power.*

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-16 17:41:21)

Sitting down where he is, studying the records he has found, Gisah canÂ´t help but smile at the conversation he was hearing through the aural amplifier he was wearing. The device had always served him well on hunts, and it would appear as if he had been correct in assuming it would be useful among all the scheming Sith in the academy as well.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-16 17:42:19)

The Quarren smiles, or at least, the Quarren equivalent of a smile, saying, "Correct. What is your name, Initiate?"
Garrak notices that while the lock electronic, and thus very difficult to disable, there seems to be some discoloration on one of the large wall stones near the the door. A closer look reveals the presence of some kind of sand-like substance at the base of said stone.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-16 17:44:25)

Dorn bows at the waist, while never taking his eyes off of the Quarren.
"I am Dorn Gracus, Master. I regret that I haven't yet learned your name."

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-16 17:49:03)

Garrak notices the odd stone and instinctively pushes it. Expecting it to reveal something hidden. The thought did cross his mind that it could be a trap however.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-16 17:50:51)

"You may address me as 'Master of Learning,' or simply Master Grathk. I will be watching your progress with great interest, Initiate. Know that you have earned something that may prove invaluable this day: Respect." With that, the Master returns to his place at the top of the stairs leading to the archives.
Garrak hears a slight scraping sound, and feels the stone give slightly. However, it has not moved any noticeable amount, and seems like it will take a fair amount of effort to move.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-16 17:59:07)

Dorn makes a mental note.
*Master Grathk. Interesting. He may prove useful to me in my acquisition of power.*
Dorn turns to leave the archives, fully intending to return in the middle of the night to make good on the plan he told his new master. After all, Knowledge **is** Power.
On his way out, he tries to get an impression from the other students who are in the archives.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-16 18:05:50)

Dorn successfully senses Gisah's interest in something, though he is unable to identify what he was interested in. There are no other living beings to sense the feelings of.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-16 18:10:47)

Knowing that the archives might not be the best place to get a word in with the lizard who was obviously interested in something, Dorn continued on his way out of the archives.
*Maybe he found an ancient sith recipe for roasted, something. I'll have to make sure that I have a word with him later.*
Dorn continued own his way to his room, where he intended to meditate for a few hours before going back to the archives.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-16 18:14:48)

Garrak notices the slight movement and pushes harder. Trying to shift the stone and see what would happen. He glanced around to check now one was watching.
*This room, must contain something of worth*

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-16 18:16:41)

The stone moves noticeably now, though the scraping noise increases in volume proportionally to how hard Garrak pushes. A quick glace confirms that no one is nearby, for the moment.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-16 18:33:43)

Garak stops for a moment and summons all of his strength before pushing the stone again. Getting frustrated with the effort needed to move a simple stone.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-16 18:34:21)

Briefly feeling something brush at the edge of his consciousness, Gisah ignores it, whatever it was. He had found a most intriguing tome detailing the prowess of Ajunta Pall, one of the first Dark Lords. Pall had been a powerful warrior, standing in the front in battle against the Jedi Order, single-handedly laying dozens of Jedi to rest.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-16 18:37:10)

The stone finally gives way, sliding easily into the room beyond. The resulting opening is just large enough to crawl through.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-16 18:39:11)

Garak crawls through the small space, emerging on the other side. He immediately stands up and begins to search the room, methodically for now but a sense of urgency begins to creep upon him.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-16 18:42:58)

The room contains a simple bed, with nothing but dust under it, a desk with a few blank pieces of flimsi, and what appears to be a holocron on a pedestal. However, a closer inspection reveals that it is just a model, and not in fact the real thing. In your disappointment, you almost miss the slight discoloration of a stone in the back of the room, similar to the stone that allowed you in.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-16 18:45:34)

He sighed inside as the quick search revealsednothing.
*A waste of my time… What's that*
He headed towards the discoloured stone and pushed it with the same determination as he did the first.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-16 18:50:10)

The stone gives after a while, sliding into the room beyond, like before. This room is lit by a dim blue light, and is completely filled with metal shelves, with narrow lanes in between. On the shelves are a variety of Sith artifacts and other items of interest. However, before you can peruse the room thoroughly, you hear the sound of someone keying in the code on the electronic lock of the door to the main room.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-16 18:57:31)

Garrak quickly turned around and tried to put the stone back in it's place. He then crouched down and tried to slow his breathing. If he was quiet enough, maybe the Lord would leave without noticing hhim there.. And give him a chance to gain some real power.

---

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **zenkatarn** (2009-03-16 19:01:30)

A full five minutes pass in silence. Just as you start to think you might have made it unnoticed, a voice you don't recognize comes from the other side of the wall. "Don't bother trying to hide. I know you're back there. If you were going to try and hide, you should have replaced the first stone you moved as well." You here the sound of the stone being pushed in, as whoever is on the other side of the wall attempts to gain access to the secret room.

Garak cursed under his breath as he stood up.
"This, must happen a lot? Students attempting to find an edge, an advantage over their peers?"
Garrak tried to stay calm, he resisted the urge to simply draw his blade and chop off whatever bodypart he could reach first. That wouldn't do him any good though...

"Of course it does." The voice says as its owner finishes pushing the stone in. The man who crawls through and stands up in front of you is the dark clothed Zabrak student! "It's what I'm doing right now." He looks around the room, obviously impressed, though whether at the collection or himself, you can't tell.

Anger begins to build within Garak as he fully realises the situation.. He hid from a mere acolyte and now it seems he'll have to deal with him somehow.
"You don't truly expect me to share this knowledge do you?"
Garrak moved his right arm in a position to easily pull out his Skullblade if needed.

"I would rather think not. Unfortunately for you, I feel the same way." He says, pulling his robe aside to reveal the hilt of a lightsaber. "I made sure to pick mine up early. Surely you did the same?" He made no attempt to disguise the overconfident sneer that spread across his face.

The Zabrak draws his saber and ignites it, its red blade lighting up the room. He quickly reaches out with the Force, trying to stun his opponent before he can act. The attack succeeds, and while it is not enough to stop the Felucian, it does give him the second he needs to dodge the attack. However, before the battle can continue, an alarm sounds in the secret room, and Lord Zyne's voice comes from the speaker over head.

Garak quickly turned and grabbed the first thing his *hand* touched on a shelf before leaving the room. As soon as he'd gotten a few metres from the room he began to walk normally, attempting to not arouse any suspisicion. He headed back to his room to check over whatever it is he just picked up.

Reaching his dorm, Dorn locked the door to his room. Looking around briefly at the sparse quarters, he knew that this would be a fitting spot for now, until he found another, more powerful.
Sitting down on the floor, Dorn crossed his legs and placed his hands, index fingers tucked under his thumbs, on his knees. Breathing deeply, Dorn reached out in the Force, trying to find out where the more powerful initiates were. It was time he got to know his enemies.

You sense the six of the other students, but are unable to get a fix on the masters. The first one you sense is the Felucian, who is only slight weaker in the Force than you. He is in a room two rooms to your right. Directly across the hallway from the Felucian's room is a Zabrak, who's Force strength equals the Felucian's. One of the two humans is also in the hallway leading to the archives. He is just slightly above average in Force strength. Still inside the archives is the Chistori, who's Force Strength is similar to the human's. In the Saber Training Hall, you sense a Cathar who's Force Strength is merely average. Lastly, directly across the hall from you, you sense a Selkath, who is only slightly less powerful than you.

*Well, it's a start.*
Dorn now has a rough estimate of the obstacles in his way to power. However, he still worries about the lizard in the archives.
*It can't be good that another student is vying for the power of the ancients. And, from first appearances, I wouldn't want to face him in lightsaber combat, therefor I **must** maintain dominance in the ability to use the Force.*
Deciding he needs to know what the Chistori was studying, Dorn reaches deep into the recesses of his mind and the dark core that is the center of his being, drawing out the power that is the Force. Dorn casts his mind out of his room and towards the archives, seeking out the Chistori. Hoping to catch a glimpse of what he's studying down there.
*Then, I can hide those scrolls from him in the future. Knowledge is Power. And Knowledge of one's enemies is Power over them.* he thinks smugly to himself.

You find three items of interest. One is a heavy, 750 page tome entitled "The Lure of the Dark Side and its Practical Application," by Marka Ragnos. Another is a smaller manuscript, only about 200 pages, titled "The Fundamentals of Calling Upon the Dark Side," by Naga Sadow.

Realizing what the Chistori was studying, Dorn felt a twinge of fear that he might have a rival for true power. However, he dismissed such thoughts immediately. Even if other students found tomes of study, even written by the Great Sith Lords of the past, they would never understand them. Not like he would. He was also confident that Master Grathk would defend his archives, at least while he was watching them.
Deciding that the archives were safe for now, Dorn instead cast his mind towards each of the initiates that he'd previously sensed. He wanted to know how they felt at this moment. He especially wanted to know which ones were afraid. Fear was a valuable tool, after all. And he could manipulate those fears to his advantage, once he knew them.

Davkas seems excited about something, but also afraid of his own weakness. Gisah is still intently focused on his reading. The Cathar is enjoying herself immensely. Garrak seems proud of himself, but you also sense a tinge of worry. The Zabrak is similarly worried, and angry as well.

Now that he had an inkling of what his opponents were feeling, Dorn decided to make his first move. After taking a minute to rest from his exertions (regaining his Force Strength), Dorn stood in one fluid motion, walked to the door of his room and stepped out into the hallway. Using what he'd sensed earlier as a locator for each initiate, Dorn walked straight towards the Selkath's room. Not even bothering to knock, Dorn simply checks to see if the door is open.
(If it is, continue. If not, he knocks.)
"Greetings, brother!" Dorn says with a smile on his face as he enters the amphibian's room. "I see you're a Selkath. You must be **terribly** uncomfortable here. I can't even imagine! Might I ask a favor? Even a nerf-headed saurian like the Chistori down in the archives right now reading through ancient texts would be able to sense you're great power in the Force. I know I certainly can. I was wondering how you could even stand that such a weakling as that one would even **dare** tread foot in what should obviously be **your** personal study area. I myself would be absolutely enraged to find a weaker dark sider, if you can even call him that, defiling the teachings of such great lords of the past as Ajunta Pall. How **dare** he? I think you should go down there and show him a thing or two. That's beside the point. I was wondering if, after you show that lizard who's who around here, if you would teach me some techniques. I'm afraid I'm woefully unprepared."

The Selkath stands from his desk, where he appears to have been reading something. He glares at Dorn with the intensity of a bull Rancor. And then he says, "To what advantage of mine would it be to challenge the Chistori to a duel, may I ask? I agree, the archives should be preserved from unworthy eyes, but do you truly believe lowly violence is the way to prevent this lizard's incursion?" He crosses the room and stands in front of Dorn, never letting up his glare. "I understand your mind, like your grasp of the Force, is limited, but surely even you can see the advantage of duplicity and espionage?"

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-17 11:34:00)

Delving deeper into the tome regarding Ajunta Pall, Gisah learned more of PallÂ´s prowess, including the legends of the Dark LordÂ´s blade. Apparently Ajunta Pall had been a skilled alchemist as well as a master swordsman. His blade was said to have been forged using ancient Sith techniques and the power of the Dark Side, making it as formidable a weapon as a lightsaber.
This was something Gisah found very interesting, as he had never felt really comfortable with the energy weapon he had been assigned as he came to the academy. He had always preferred the heavy, steady weight of a more traditional weapon in his hands, and thanks to his training with the Keetael, he could summon the Force to turn even the simplest weapon into a tool of destruction.

Pacing for a few more minutes Val finally stops and gazes around his room once more, well time to get a move on he thought, doing something would be better than allowing some meager fear eat away at him.
Moving towards the door he leaves and heads down the hallway towards the archives.
He looks around and try's to located a copy of some basic force principles, everything he had done had always been luck he thought, but knowing now that it was this force. He had to learn the basics so he could build a solid foundation, and what better place than this archive of sith knowledge.

As Dawntracker enters the Saber Training Hall, an anguished cry reached his ears followed by a loud thump. Then, a female voice says, "Come on, is that the best you idiots can do? I need a real challenge here!" The Cather you saw outside is fighting several other students in the middle of the combat ring. As you are taking this in, a Zabrak in the robes of a Master approaches you. "Another new student, hm? Here to duel or to pick up your lightsaber?"

The Master walks over to a box with an electronic lock on it, which he deactivates, and retrieves a lightsaber from it. As he hands it to you, he answers your question. "There are only three. All battles must have only two combatants in the arena at once. Both students fight until one yields or is incapable of continuing the fight. And most importantly, you may not kill your opponent. If you attempt to do so, a master will intervene. If you would like to do battle, the current champion is that new Cathar student. She's really rather impressive. I should think beating her might net you some amount of prestige." With that, the Zabrak returns to his position near the ring.

After studying the texts for several hours, Val thinks he may have gotten the main principles laid out in the text.
Hmmm, he thought, now some where to practice without being seen if I fail.
With that Val headed back to his room and began to practice some of the principles he had come across to quiet his mind and feel his surroundings. Letting his emotions fuel him, he began to understand what the masters had written.
Meditating for an hour or so with his breathing slowing and his mind wandering through the ripples he could sense, Val was in complete awe at the sheer enormity of what he was doing.
Feeling it was time practice "reaching out" and "effecting the world" Val placed his trophy silver lightsaber in front of himself and began to try to levitate it.
After several frustrated attempts, he finally succeeds in lifting the lightsaber and moving it back to himself.
Val Laughed at his success. Small as it was in relation most likely to other students here, he was ready for his steps into a larger world.
Now time to get some grub he thought and headed out his room to he mess hall.

Hearing the Selkath's comment, Dorn realized that he was stronger than he'd originally thought. However, it appeared that the Selkath hadn't realized Dorn's actual Force Potential. Perhaps this was not the one he should start out with. He knew he could try to force the issue, but that might reveal his hand too soon. Deciding that it would be better to try this form of attack later, Dorn bowed towards the Selkath.
"Of course. Of course. I see why you're one of the stronger initiates here. Undoubtadly you'll become a great Sith Lord one day soon. I have no doubt that you've amassed a large collection of knowledge in your time here. I tried sneaking one of the scrolls out of the archives earlier, but my bumbling attempt was thwarted by Master Garthk.

That is why you two will never become turly powerful." The felucian stopped for a moment in thought, "If I wanted you dead, I wouldn't have to wait until you were asleep.

Dorn smiled inwardly. This tentacly creature would not pose a threat to his ascent to true power. He had a brief image in his mind of the Felucian laying on the ground, smoke rising from the crispy body. He wondered briefly if this would work. If it didn't, he would have to lay off for a few minutes. Pushing minds was difficult work. He decided to lay the foundations of a future inner war between these two.
However, hearing the Felucian's comments, he decided that not much help would be needed. Knowing that he could resist the Felucian's power, he decides instead to hide his true powers and let things play themselves out.

Finding the texts regarding Ajunta Pall to be very intriguing, Gisah feels like he has been in the archives long enough.

While he himself has no interest of getting involved in the plotting and scheming behind the scenes of the academy, he feels that he should no doubt feel them out. Replacing the scrolls and tomes, he gets up and starts to make his way for the training area.

The Selkath finds himself lying on the floor for the second time in a disturbingly short period of time. However, before he could make the foolish fauna pay for its crime of hurting him, a loud voice echoes down the corridor. "What are you doing, if I may ask?" The yellow skinned Lord Zyne comes striding quickly to the room, stepping between the two combatants. "You are not allowed to kill fellow students. Honestly, you are a most troublesome group." The Feeorin looks at the three Initiates in turn, clearly annoyed. "Each of you are to return to your rooms and sleep. You will begin your training tomorrow.

Dorn bows at the waist, still not removing his eyes from anybody. He has to work to keep his anger in check. He had intended on letting the two combatants wear each other out and then to finish off the Selkath had the Felucian not done so himself. His plans would have to wait, though. Time to kill would come soon enough.
"Of course, Master Zyne. As you command."
Straightening out to just barely standing (still concealing his true power), Dorn retreated from the room to his own. Once there, he sat down on the floor, crossing his legs and laying his hands, palms up, on his knees. He meditated on the Force, seeking the moment when he would have the best chance at making it to the archives in the night. Even if a perfect time didn't come, he would take a good time. He cast his senses outward from his room, trying to get a position on every Force user in the academy.

During his meditation, every few minutes, Dorn reaches out through the Force to the Selkath in the other room. He already knows the Selkath has negative feelings towards the Felucian. Those feelings only need to be fanned. Every few minutes or so, Dorn sends out a short telepathic message to the Selkath, while also working to actively cover his tracks so the Selkath never realizes where the voices are coming from.
*Felucian must die*
*Primitive, worthless, expendable*
*Masters won't care*
Repeating the phrase over and over again, stoking the hatred that the amphibian already seems to possess for the fungal initiate, while masking his presence so to continue to remain anonymous.

However, when it returned the second time, he was aware enough to recognize the voice in his head.

He continued using the Force to keep track of the occupants of the academy, fulling planning to sneak out the moment that they all were in their respective quarters.
He also meditated on the best way to get out of his room without alerting the masters. He was sure that they'd left some method of discovering if students left in the night. Perhaps he could discover it and bypass it. No need to take it out. Let the masters think their methods worked and they wouldn't bother putting up new ones.

The Zabrak Master nods, walking over to the rack on the wall. He removes what looks like a simple sword, and hands it to Dawntracker. "This is a Training Saber. Its blade is covered in minuscule barbs taken from the Pelko bug. Its venom can temporarily paralyze any limb struck. This is the weapon of the Training Hall." He then notes the arrival of Gisah, who he asks, "Here to fight or pick up your lightsaber? If you want a fight, you'll have to wait until the current one is done."

"Oh, someone new!" The Cathar student twirls her training saber in a quick flourish, settling into a ready stance. "Let's get started then!" She starts off the fight by leaping over Dawntracker's head, striking down at him as she passes over him. The attack scratches Davkas, but is not deep enough to affect him with the Pelko poison.

Gisah shifts his body enough to show the lightsaber hanging at his hip.

While he waits for the current duel to end, he looks around in the training chamber, looking over the various weapons found there.

Dawntracker winces a bit from the scratch then turns with the training saber with an upward slash hoping the Cathar would be to intent on holding a strong offense rather then a defense.
"Gee I bet you always keep the boys running don't ya?"
Dawntracker feels a rush as he does it, he was using the force...or was it just the adrenaline?

Despite Davkas's sudden rush of adrenalin and the Force, the Cathar parried his strike, twisting as she did to fully avoid the blow. "Not a bad attempt, but trust me, you'll have to do a **lot** better." She grips her saber with both hands, aiming to finish the fight with this blow. However, still off balance from the previous parry, she fails to hit Davkas, her blade cutting thin air instead.

The Cathar barely manages to get her blade up in time to parry the attack. The powerful blow results in a loud clang and the two blades begin to vibrate from the impact. The Cathar's counter attack gives Davkas another scratch, but he remains standing despite the pain and growing amount of poison in his system. "Really? 'Cause I think I'm doing ok on my own!"

Davkas's blade stabs through the Cathar's shoulder, prompting her to cry out in pain. "You...are dead!" She screams, bringing her blade over head and swinging it down on Dawntracker with the power of the Force behind her blow. It sinks into her target's shoulder, paralyzing his right arm. Even as she does, however, her own right arm is paralyzed by the Pelko poison in Davkas's blade. Breathing heavily, she gasps out, "I don't intend...to lose...this fight..."

As Davkas puts his last reserves of energy into his attack, the Cathar did the same, and their blades met in mid-swing. The two locked in a pushing contest, but with only one arm each, neither could make significant headway. Then, the Force gave Davkas's blade a little nudge, and the two blades slipped off each other. The Cathar's sword sliced thin air, but Davkas's went straight on to hit the Cathar's other shoulder. Her eyes went wide for a moment, then closed as she passed out. The sword in her hand slipped from her grasp and hit the floor with a clang. She started to fall, but was caught by the Zabrak Master before she hit the ground. "The match is over. The winner is Dawntracker."

The Zabrak walks to the center of the arena, holding up his hand to silence the murmurs of the other students. "The battle witnessed here was impressive, and bloody. Just the way a battle between two Sith should be. The hour is late, however. We will allow only one more challenge before we close the Hall. And because Dawntracker is in no condition to fight, we will allow any two students to step into the ring. Do so now if you wish to battle." With that small speech, he walks over to Davkas, saying, "We are not so foolish as to neglect the necessity of proper medical facilities. Follow me, and I will take you and your vanquished opponent there." He then picks up the Cathar and walks out into the hallway, turning left and walking to the Medical Hall. You're not sure, but you think you may have impressed him with your battle.

Watching the two students leave the circle, Gisah turns his eyes towards the rest of the students. The previous fight had been pretty good, but he hoped there would be even more of a challenge among the rest of them. No reason to fight a fight unless you gave it your all.
Summoning one of the training sabers into his hand he steps into the circle, weighing the weapon in his hand while waiting for an opponent.

As Gisah steps forward to battle, a human steps into the circular ring as well. He has a cocky grin on his face, and seems completely certain of his victory. "Its a bit annoying, really. I was going to challenge whoever won that last fight, but they went and ran off on me. Well, you'll have to do I guess." He stretches his arm out, and someone places a training saber in it. It seems he must be fairly respected in the Training Hall.

Spinning the blade in his hand into a backhanded grip, Gisah looks up at his opponent. He could immediately sense the radiating pride and cockiness from his opponent, and mentally, he sighed. If this man was as arrogant as he seemed, but lacked the skills to back it up, this would be over shortly. If he did however, this could turn out to be most interesting.
He started to pace slowly a few steps to the right, holding his saber behind him in one hand, the other hand held in front of him, tracing the movements of his opponent with his index finger.

The Human smirks, twirling his blade in a quick flourish. "Ah, defend and counter attack, eh? Unfortunately for you, I've seen it all before. This tactic isn't even a problem." He takes a step back, then starts running forward. Just before reaching his opponent, he jumps and flips over his opponent. As he does, you see an opening to attack, and stab up, forcing him to parry and land in front of you. However, his attack gets through your defense, cutting slightly into your side, which begins numbing from the Pelko bug poison. With a smirk, he says, "Not bad, but not good enough"

"Whoa!" The Human attempts to block the incoming attack, but the sheer power of Gisah's attack batters his saber aside and slices into his arm. "Gah!" His left arm falls limp at his side, now useless. "That's...quite impressive." Holding his saber in his only remaining hand, he stabs twice quickly at Gisah, hoping one of the two attacks would slip through his opponent's defense. However, Gisah simply knocks the sword aside, nullifying the attack completely.

As he parries fist one, then two blows from his opponent, Gisah moves in close, stabbing his blade towards his the manÂ´s shoulder.

The Human staggers back from the powerful blow, his breathing irregular. Taking a moment to steady his breathing, he prepares for his counter attack. "I have no intention of losing to a neophyte like you." His eyes become bloodshot, and the Dark Side flows through his body freely. With his inner rage awakened, he strikes out at Gisah, and manages to land a light blow on his shoulder.

As Gisah raises his blade to strike, the Human misjudges the blow as a high swing, and ducks to try to avoid it. Thus, when Gisah swings low, the blade that would have just removed the man's leg decapitates him, leaving his body headless. At that moment, the Zabrak Master walks back into the room. Seeing the dead body, he quickly moves to take charge of the situation. "Congratulations, Initiate. You have provided a great service in exposing and cleaning out this unworthy rat. However, there are rules against killing your fellow students in the ring. I'd appreciate you heeding them next time. For tonight, everyone return to your beds. Your lessons resume on the morrow."

Garak decided to leave his room. He'd been injured worse than he thought, and though he didn't want to admit it, he needed to get it looked at by a professional. He headed to the Med-bay and found a doctor to treat him. He was surprised with their knowledge of Felucian Physiology, it was almost too good. After he'd been treated Garak headed back to his room.

Sensing that all were in their respective beds, Dorn arose from his meditative position.

Once in the hall, Dorn briefly wondered whether or not speed should be a factor in his sneaking around. After all, if he could get to the archives and back quickly, he'd be less likely to be seen. However, the same might also be said of moving slowly and methodically.
Deciding that speed would be a key here, Dorn reached into the Dark Side of the Force to spur his actions along. He wanted to get to the archives quickly, and so he added on the speed.

It takes you 4 rounds to reach the archives. You do so undetected, however, once you reach the archives...
"Ah, greetings, Mr. Gracus. Here for some late-night reading? I believe Lord Zyne asked that you remain in your room until tomorrow morning, but I certainly have no intentions of telling him if you don't intend to." Grathk's voice comes from the back room of the archives, followed shortly by Grathk himself. His presence silently warns you *not* to try to steal from his archives...again. "For future reference, it would be unwise to tell the enemy your plans, even hypothetically, and then still attempt the same tactic."

Dorn starts upright instantly upon hearing the Quarren's voice. Straightening out into his normal height, Dorn turned around and looked the archivist in the eyes. Seeing the Quarren Sith Lord, Dorn put a friendly smile on his face.
"Truth be told, Master, I didn't think you would believe a student to actually be stupid enough to attempt a crime after confessing to the plan. Most students would have the... Let's see, what would you call it? Courage, valor, stupidity, insanity? There are so many options to describe this kind of plan. To confess ones intentions of rule breaking to a figure of authority, and then to commit said crime in the exact way one said one would."
He let his words hang in the air for a few seconds before continuing. "Besides, scrolls have been stolen from these archives before, Master. And, I figured that what was once violated could be so done again. After all, if that amphibious Selkath could manage it in such uncomfortable circumstances as this, surely I could do it better. You simply proved to be a better Master of Learning than the previous archivist, since **he** allowed the theft and you've prevented it. Because, I'm sure that if it had happened on **your** watch, you would want to do something about it."
Reaching deep into the Force around him and in him, he reached out towards the Quarren's master's mind, knowing that the master wouldn't want someone to steal from his precious archives and would probably want to do something about it. Dorn strained his considerable mental powers to help him out in this endeavor. He knew that the Selkath would have to be taken care of eventually, and what better way than for someone else to do it for him. No way for the evidence to be tied back to him. And, who would question the wisdom of a master killing a student who stole from him.
Turning his head towards Grethk, Dorn smiled his most disarming smile. "Since you're up, Master, could you recommend something for me to read?"

Grathk seems amused by your reasoning, and does not seem at all angry, likely because he figures that Dorn's plan was foiled, and he does not need to worry about his archives being disturbed. That is, until Dorn uses the Force to convince him to go after the Selkath. Then he seems to get *very* angry. "The fish defiled *my* archives!? This shall not stand!" As the Quarren rushes to the stairs to leave the archives, he hands Dorn a sheet of flimsi, saying, "This is a list of my favorite tomes. They are long but very informative." After saying this, he moves as fast as his robes will allow him, heading for the Selkath's room.

## Re: Episode I: Sunset

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-22 14:25:11)

Dorn accepted the flimsi from Grathk and smiled quietly as the *master* went to handle the misbehaving student. He truly hoped that the amphibian would be dead soon and not simply punished. Otherwise, Dorn might have to actually handle it himself.
With his hopes now raised, he looked down the list of tomes on the flimsi and turned towards the shelves of the archives, intent on finding something to read, but deciding to stay in the archives for the time being while reading. After all, if Grathk was **that** angered at a fellow amphibian, who knows how angry he might get at a primate sneaking scrolls out. Also, he imagined that he now had free use of the archives at any time he chose. He **would** steal from this archive at some point, but not yet. With his only real competition now gone, he had all the time in the world.
Finding a tome on the mental abilities of past Sith Lords, Dorn sat down at a small table and began to read.

After searching for some time, Dorn realized that this might **not** be the place Grathk would leave the good stuff after all. With a sigh of resignation, he again returned to the flimsi that the Quarren had left him, this time choosing a treatise on using the Force to help one's natural abilities, or lack thereof. Dorn was particularly interested on using the Force to heighten one's *constant* senses, as opposed to when he was just focusing on it. This would be a **very** useful technique to learn.
After studying for a while, curiosity got the better of him, and Dorn wanted to know how things were going with the Selkath. Replacing the treatise he'd been studying, Dorn found a corner of the archives that was not easily seen from the door way, just in case, sat down, and meditated on the Force, trying to locate the Selkath, and glimpse him through the Force. Dorn really hoped to see a charred husk of an amphibian.

Upon glimpsing his vision, Dorn seems to remember seeing a scroll of some sort on the Selkath's desk. He'd been studying something. And he **refused** to believe that it was something **not** stolen from the archives.

Reaching out with the Force, and praying the Grathk would not take anger at the situation, Dorn sent out one silent message, hoping that it would work:
*Check the desk.*
He continued to monitor the situation, when he realized something. There was a chance that the scroll that he'd seen on the Selkath's desk was not stolen from the archives, and that would spell doom for Dorn. Deciding to take matters into his own hands, Dorn quickly stood up and grabbed a scroll from the shelves that matched Grathk's list. Tucking the scroll into his sleeves, and the list folded into his belt compartments, Dorn quickly listened to the Force to see if it was safe to travel back towards the Selkath's room. He knew that there was still a chance that this might work.
(Assuming that it's safe to travel, and possibly if it's not:)
While Dorn traveled through the halls at night, being careful to mask his presence with the Force, he stood ready to cast an illusion, no matter the personal cost, to make it appear that he was in fact **not** in the halls at night. Upon reaching the Selkath's room, he cast an Illusion again, this time to again mask his presence from anyone while he secreted the scroll to just within the door. Once that was done, and hoping that no one noticed him as well as Grathk finding the scroll in the Selkath's room, Dorn quietly slinked back into his own room, where he meditated for the remainder of the evening.

The next morning, all of you arrive at the main lecture hall, where you have been order to for the start of your studies. Standing at the head of the hall is, not surprisingly, Lord Zyne. Flanking him are Grathk and the Zabrak saber master, and all three wear emotionless expressions. Then Zyne cracks a smile. "Well, it seems that you all survived your first day here. Well, except for that trash you rid us of, Mr. Gisah." At this, the Zabrak master laughs quietly, though only briefly. "It is time for you to receive your first assignments as Sith Initiates. We have watched all of you from your arrival here. And we have not missed anything." As he says this, Zyne stares directly at Garak and Dorn. "We have decided to send five of you on a little field trip, to test your abilities. The five chosen will be based upon our observations thus far. Master Grathk, perhaps you would like to announce our first pick?"
The Quarren bows to Zyne, saying, "Of course. My nomination for this honor is Initiate Dorn Gracus. He has impressed me with his duplicity last night. For future reference though, if you are going to plant evidence in another student's room, do not plant a scroll that I know was there before I left. The fact that it was on the list I gave you should have dissuaded you from using it." After saying this, he steps back behind Zyne, who then beckons the Zabrak forward.
"My nominations are Gisah and Davkas Dawntracker. Their feats in my training hall were impressive, and worthy of recognition." He then steps back, giving the stage back to Zyne.
The Lord of the Academy nods in turn to Grathk and the Zabrak, and then says, "And as for myself, I have nominated Garak. Not only did he have the initiative to steal from my own quarters, he fought off another student who had the same idea, and got away with one of my Rubat crystals. And don't worry, I don't expect it back. Our final decision was a difficult one, but as he did nothing to lose favor with us, we have decided to send Valerian Pandak as the fifth." After saying this, Zyne steps back, ending his speech with, "You will report back here in one hour for your mission briefing. You have until then to prepare. Dismissed!" He and the other two masters then turn and leave the hall.

Garak was impressed, the thought has crossed his mind on more than one occasion of how exactly a Sith academy could function. With each student vying for more power, taught by Masters who themselves would be seeking the rewards of the dark side. They seemed to manage perfectly though, he'd have to be more careful in future endeavours. After they'd finished speaking he nodded and headed to his room to prepare. He planned on taking his recently aqquired lightsaber alongside his revered skullblade. He wouldn't use it however, he hadn't been trained in it's use and preferred to make kills silently. Of course apart from the sound of shattering bones.

Dorn nodded towards the Master of Learning. While his plans on having the Selkath killed by an enraged master were foiled, he had learned a valuable lesson. He would be more careful in his future plans.
As Dorn turned towards the group, he kept his eyes carefully looking around the room for the Selkath. Upon finding the amphibious initiate, he reached out with the Force to peer into the creature's feelings. He had to make sure that nothing un-towards would happen in the next hour. And, if it did, he would have to be the one to do it.

You are surprised to find the Selkath is more angry at the masters than you.

Noticing the Selkath's feelings, Dorn walked in the direction of the dorms. He planned on meditating for a few minutes to find out how to best prepare for the future mission.
As he walked down the hall way, he came to the Selkath's door. A thought passed through his mind. Dorn peered into the Force to find the Selkath. If he was far enough away to give Dorn ample time, Dorn might leave a small present for the Selkath. Surely the amphibious initiate required special equipment on this furnace of a world. Maybe something he could slip a poison into. Something that would kill the Selkath *after* he'd left on this mission.

The Selkath is currently across the temple. However, you feel that poisoning the Selkath, while beneficial in the extremely short term, might not be wise in the long term.

Garak had a long think about his 'fellow' apprentices. He had no intention of aiding them in the long run but a short term alliance could prove useful. Until he's learnt enough to take out whoever he chose to side with, of course. He began to meditate, calling upon the spirits of his homeland to guide him. His ancestors and the spirits of Shaman's before him.

Dorn nods his head, disappointed, but sure in his knowledge of the Force. Turning from the Selkath's room, Dorn enters his own and meditates on the best method to prepare for the mission.

As the masters left them to their own thoughts, Gisah decided to remain outside and meditate. Looking around, he found a nice spot, if a spot could be said to be nice on the volcanic planet of Mustafar. While he was sure he would savor whatever mission the masters presented before him, but to be honest, heÂ´d rather perform the hunt himself, given some of the other students. He would probably never get used to the ways of the Sith, but going on a mission with two people who were recommended by the masters simply because they were too greedy and selfish to pursuse the knowledge already available to them wasnÂ´t something that he could say he looked forward to doing.

Dawntracker headed off to his room to gather his equipment thinking ~How wonderful, getting grouped with the "Best" of the "Worst".....~ and wondered if the Force was not without a since of humor or irony.
Dawntracker gathered up his gear, clipped his new Lightsaber to his belt, he slung his Blaster Rifle on his shoulder and sheathed his sword on his back and had his CryoBan Grenades packed on his Belt. Whatever Dawntracker would face he would be ready.
Dawntracker headed out to the meeting point for the start of the mission, he would have normally socialized with his team but under this circumstance it would be best not too.

Knowing that the time had come for the briefing, Dorn rises from his meditative position. Walking over towards his desk, Dorn pulls the utility belt off and wraps it around himself. Strapping the holster in it's place, Dorn then retrieves his pistol and short sword, his only possessions from his previous life, and holsters them on his belt. The slugthrower, as everyone else calls it, didn't have the power that a blaster might, but it was silent, using magnetics to launch the projectile on its trajectory. The short sword, the traditional weapon of the Family, was sheathed behind Dorn's back, where he could better keep it hidden. Finally, Dorn retrieves his light-foil, the weapon his previous master had given him. Finally, Dorn dons his voluminous black cloak, which usually kept all of his physical weapons hidden. Besides, Dorn very seldom pulled his physical weapons, he preferred to use the Force to destroy his enemies.
Fully dressed, Dorn unlocked the dorm door and walked into the hall and towards the briefing room. All the while, Dorn kept an eye on his surroundings, physically and through the Force. No sense in being clumsy now.

Garak had felt the time arrrive and thus left his room, heading towards the briefing. The sooner he knew what they were doing the better, he'd decided it best to try and befriend the other apprentices for now.

As you all arrive once more in the lecture hall, you notice immediately that only Lord Zyne remains in the room. He is not, however, standing on the main stage as he was before, but rather in the middle of the room, next to a holoprojector that seems to have risen from the floor. The image the projector was, well, projecting, was that of a moon. Specifically, as the name at the top of the image reads, Nar Shadda.
After giving you a moment to look at the hologram, Zyne coughs to regain your attention. "This, as you've no doubt already read, is Nar Shadda. It is the first stop on your mission." He types a few commands into the projector, and the image moves to the moon's surface. "Commonly known as the smuggler's moon, it house more criminal activity than almost any other moon. Because of the incredible population of the planet, it is difficult to find anyone one the moon. Difficult, but for a true Sith, not impossible." Here he again issues a command to the console, which changes the image to a beat-up, decrepit old *Dynamic* class star ship. "This is the *Star Skimmer*, your target's ship. It was recently seen landing on the moon, in the refugee sector. Its owner's name is Arken Oyels. He is your target." Here again Zyne changes the holo image to a shoulders-up picture of the human in question. "He is a small time smuggler, and was beneath our notice...until a routine search of his ship turned up a lightsaber crystal. Somehow he escaped from that encounter, but our surveillance of him since has revealed our worst fears: Some of the Jedi have survived!"
Pausing for effect, Zyne shuts off the holoprojector, and walks around it to stand in front of you. "Your mission is to find him, follow him to his Jedi contact, and then, once you've gotten all the useful information you can from him, kill him. Also, while you might think that this little excursion is an excellent chance to do away with your fellow students, remember: You will be watched every step of the way. The academy's rules against killing fellow students still applies outside the academy. And besides, until you become a true Sith, you may find each other useful." With this, Zyne ends the briefing with a quick wave of his hand as he turns and leaves the room.

Gisah listens to the words of his master, satisfied that the hunt would finally commence. He doesnÂ´t really like the though of killing this smuggler though. Not so much for moral reasons as it dies not appears that the challenge would be there. The Jedi however, he was sure would prove a great challenge. He didnÂ´t knew all too much about the Jedi, except for the fact that they were supposed to be skilled warriors and formidable foes. Yes, he would look forward to testing his strength against them.

Garak smiled inwardly as the Master spoke.
*A hunt.. Yes a hunt*
He muttered something in Felucian before slamming his skullblade to the ground in excitement.

Dorn allowed a small smile to creep over his lips.
*So, this is our first test. A Jedi, or at least the possibility of one. This should prove interesting. As to finding a Jedi, that shouldn't be too hard for one trained in the Sith. So, I'll locate this human and his Jedi, and send my* hounds *after them.*
Dorn smiled at that idea.

Dawntracker takes in the mission begins and begins to assess the situation. The smuggler was just doing what he could to do to get by, having fought the occasional pirates and smuggler, Dawntracker knew the difference between them.
The Jedi however he had never met one before, he had only heard tales but assumed they were just a weaker version of a Sith.
~Well this should be interesting, the rest of the group I'm sure feel excited in their own ways...~
Dawntracker turned his attention to the others
"We better get moving, I assume I will be piloting the ship so try not to kill me unless you like floating in space."
With that Dawntracker gets up and heads towards the exit of the academy to the landing dock, not looking overly excited as the others, besides who gets excited about being on a ship full of savage monsters...

Following after Dawntracker, Dorn agreed with one thing. No sense in killing anyone before he was done using them. Quickening his stride so that he caught up withe Dawntracker, Dorn nodded his head towards the other human.
"You're a pilot, huh? How good are you? We're not likely to crash or anything, are we?"

Garak followed suit, walking behind the pair he stated forcefully, "Then you'll take responsibility for anything bad that happens aboard the ship." He continued to follow the pair.
