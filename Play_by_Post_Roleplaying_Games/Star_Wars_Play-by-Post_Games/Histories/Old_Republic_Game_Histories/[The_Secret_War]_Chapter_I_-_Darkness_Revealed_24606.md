# [The Secret War] Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-08 18:10:09)

*It has been three centuries since the Galaxy was last touched by the flames of war, 300 years since the Dark Wars ended with the destruction of Malachor V. The Jedi Order, crippled and nearly hunted to extinction, have rebuilt and regained much of its strength and numbers. But now, it seems, the peace is at an end. From beyond the borders of known space, a vast Sith fleet emerges, bringing war to the Republic once again. Caught off guard, and unprepared, the Republic fleet tries to muster a defense. In the space above the peaceful planet Artorias, the RNS Calloipe hangs alone, stationed on patrol duty around the system. Gathered aboard is a small group of Jedi and the commanding officer of the ship. They have each been individually summoned, although they don´t yet know why…*
You have all been gathered aboard the ship, and have taken your seats in the briefing room. You yet don´t know why you´ve been called here. For Elspeth Duquesne it seems simple. She´s here because she´s the commander of the ship. The other three however, young and unexperienced Jedi who´ve barely made or are soon to become Jedi Knights, have been pulled from whichever corner of the Galaxy they happened to be in. Hopefully, the answers will come to you now, as an older man enters the room. He is human, and judging from the robes he is wearing and the metallic cylinder hanging from his belt, a Jedi. He wears a graying beard, the same color as his long hair, and from the looks of it, he has been in the Order for some time. As he reaches the end of the table you are seated around, he places his hands on the back of the chair in front of him and speaks.
"Greetings to you all, I am Master Belth Allusis. I suppose you are wondering why you have been summoned here. The answer is simple. As you all know, the resurrected Sith Empire have been rolling in over our territories in the outlying sectors for several years now. Despite our best efforts, system after system is falling to their might. The shipyards of Sluis Van lies in ruins, and Korriban has fallen back into Sith hands. This invasion must be stopped, or the entire Republic is in danger"
He pauses for a moment, looking at each of you, and you can see a burning passion and determination in his eyes.
"As we so painfully learned centuries ago in the Mandalorian Wars, the actions of a few can send ripples throughout the Galaxy that alters the course of the future. Which is why each of you have been summoned here"
The Jedi Master lets go of the chair and starts to pace a circle around the room, as if to let this information sink in.

Neku leaned back in his chair, his foot tapping against the floor to the rhythm of a song that he was playing through his headphones. As a result, he didn't notice the Jedi Master enter the room until Yoshiya, his Guardian Spirit, whispered in his mind, *"Neku, pay attention!"*
The young Force adept immediately sat up in his chair and pulled his headphones down so they rested around his neck. He then gave his full attention to the Master as he spoke. Yoshiya shook his ethereal head, even though no one in the room could see him, saying, *"Honestly, Neku, do I have to do everything for you?"*
Neku frowned and glared over his shoulder at his ever-present annoyance. *Oh, shut it, will you?* he projected his thoughts at Yoshiya, expressing his annoyance. Yoshiya's spirit just smiled and shrugged in response as Neku returned his attention to the Master, waiting for him to speak again.

Willum sits at the table, yawning just before the Master comes in. He's tired, physically from the war, and mentally fatigued to a greater extreme due to the things he's seen recently. After the Master comes in and begins the briefing WIllum's old familiar worrying begins to stir when the Master begins speaking of great being's wakes crashing throughout the galaxy in the Mandalorian Wars. He worries, and he waits to hear more...

Captain Elspeth Duquesne stands ramrod straight at the back of the relatively small room, her beige uniform with brown overtones and a deep red beret marking her clearly as being an officer of the Tapani Imperial Navy.
She quietly observes the assembled Jedi with a wary look, knowing full well that the milk runs ended the moment they stepped onboard. Part of her couldn't help but resent the fact that some of her crew would probably die, couldn't help but blame the Jedi if it happened, and yet deep down she knew that it was part of the job. Any assignment had a potential for danger and it wasn't a fear of dying or squimishness, no it was a certain mistrust of Jedi. Civilians, mystical or not, with power over the military was never good in her book.
When no one seems to speak up, she intercepts the pacing Jedi.
"I take it the Calliope will be requested to provide transport." She pulls out a datapad from her tunic. "What are the mission parameters?"

Solon Niachei waited silently with eyes closed, the very image of a monk with his fingers intertwined, resting on his lap and his straight posture in his chair. He was in fact resting. Called away from his fleet with no new duty station onboard he was taking the moment to rest.
As comfortable as he could get in his chair, his mind was still. Letting his mind work as it willed the single query appeared in his mind. *How is Master Sk'ade and the fleet faring?* Having been on the battlefront for the better part of a year, attrition would mount from pure fatigue.
Sensing a presence coming to join them Solon adjusted himself to watch and hear the apparent Jedi Master. Having completed his speech Master Allusis circles the assembled. Doubt appears to Solon as he mulls over the words. *A zealous leader proclaiming the forging of a future often leads to ruin. And only those chosen by destiny get to 'shape the future', were it so easy to simply pick a few and change the course of the Sith invasion.* Remembering the stories of the so called Jedi Civil War he wonders whether one of the others assembled has done something so noteworthy that the meeting was arranged for the grand scheme.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-09 20:09:18)

Being interrupted in his stride, Master Allusis halts in front of Elspeth.
"Yes, that would be a correct assumption. As a matter of fact, you and your crew have been officially relieved of your service under the regular fleet until further notice. For the time being, you answer only to me"
Continuing his circle until he reached the place where it had begun, the Jedi Master speaks again.
"As for the nature of your mission, it is a simple thing, that is far more complex to accomplish. The Sith advance must be stopped. With the way the war have developed so far, the Republic have begun to look at more...unconventional strategies to turn the tide. As you know, the shipyards of Sluis Van were devastated by the Sith attack. However, Republic Intelligence have reported that the shipyards have been restored, and that the Sith are now using them to produce new ships for their fleet"
He pauses to clear his throat for a moment, but just as he is about to speak again, a loud alarming sound begins to echo throughout the room. Very timely, the comlink Elspeth wears around her wrist begins to sound.
"Milady, we need your presence at the bridge. Two Sith cruisers have entered the system, and are approaching fast"

"I'll be right there." Elspeth answers coolly in the wristcom before turning to Master Allusis and the three others in the room.
"If you'll excuse me?... I believe we'll have to conclude this at a later time."
With a curt nod to the Jedi Master she steps out of the room at a brisk pace, heading for the bridge.

### **zenkatarn** (2010-03-09 22:05:38)

Neku leaped to his feet reflexively when the alarm sounded. Realizing that whatever the alarm was for, it was no doubt outside of the ship and thus impossible for him to do anything about, he quickly sat back down. Turning to the Jedi Master as he did, he asked, "So uh...what do we do?"

---

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-10 04:58:24)

The Jedi Master looks over to Neku, and his face is quite calm.
"We should make our way to the bridge to try and see what assistance we can offer"
Without waiting for the rest of you to follow, he starts out of the room.

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **Magical2099** (2010-03-10 05:10:07)

Willum's constant worrying, does have one benefit: he's rarely surprised. He stands and brushes his hand through the short salt and pepper scruff on his skull and turns to follow Master Allusis, his analytical mind already running numbers and probabilities,
**"Master, we have limited options. I don't know about my companions, but I am rather useless in space combat. If we move now, we can escape and return with reinforcements, or if there is a rather suicidal pilot we can borrow, I'm willing to lead a boarding team. Up close and personal is our stock and trade, after all. Unless we are aboard the Republic's very finest and battle-hardened vessel, our choices are few."**
Willum's voice carries echoes of boredom to those who can't feel the Force, but the occupants of the room undoubtedly hear the resignation and inevitability of bloodshed to come.

---

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-10 05:27:42)

Master Allusis slows down his pace somewhat to let Willum fall in beside him.
"Do not be so hasty to make assumptions based on limited information. For the moment, we know little about the approaching ships. This world is a peaceful one, lacking military defenses of its own. Perhaps they are merely troop transports, not expecting to find resistance before they reach the surface. Perhaps they are warships intent on an assault. Or perhaps they are even diplomatic vessels. Until we know more of the situation, we cannot make a well-founded judgement"

---

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **Magical2099** (2010-03-10 05:44:43)

**"Very well, Master,"** Willum replies, his voice holding the same tone. He doesn't bother to argue knowing that masters don't tend to appreciate it, no matter how logical or well founded. Half of the Master's words were proof of Willum's point, but masters didn't gain that rank by simply being old and Willum had been wrong before.

### **Thraken** (2010-03-10 06:38:21)

As the Ship sirens sounded Niachei reflexively stood to attention, sliding his chair out of the way, before waiting as he was not assigned to the crew. With Master Allusis' apparent seniority he only strides off after the Captain once he departs, so hearing the Jedi Knight's rather reckless plan of effecting an unplanned warship boarding from a corvette.
*Are all other Jedi mad? When was the last time I went back to the Temple anyway?* He doesn't actually know...
**"Master, Is our mission time sensitive? If we become engaged here alone we'll take damage and will need time to repair, 'less we proceed below strength."**

---

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-10 06:44:35)

"I would have preferred it if we could have departed as soon as the briefing was done, but we cannot just abandon the people on the planet below. Hopefully, a battle can be avoided, and if not, we must try to hold them at bay until reinforcements from nearby systems can arrive"

---

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **zenkatarn** (2010-03-10 08:11:51)

Neku followed the rest out of the briefing room, listening to the conversation without joining in. Like Willum, Neku saw no point in trying to argue with or annoy the Master with pointless questions. He'd do that with Yoshiya instead. *What do you think, bro? Any chance this is all going to be resolved without a fight?*

Elspeth strides on the bridge calling out orders.
"I want a sitrep." She says to her second before turning to her communications officer.
"Mister Kellarov, hail them. Ask them to identify themselves and state their intentions."
She sits down in her command chair and stares at the plot for a moment.
"Miss Basai, match their course and speed. We'll keep our distance until we know more."

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-10 09:19:08)

Snapping to attention as their commander enters the bridge, the officers quickly stands back down as they go about their duties.
"Milady, two Sith vessels have entered the system. Scanners have been unable to establish the exact model, but we have detected no deployment of smaller ships. They are still at the outer edges of the system, on the far side of the planet. We expect to arrive at a point where we can intercept them if they gets closer in 5 minutes"
The communications officer takes off his headgear and shakes his head.
"Negative captain, they are not responding to communications.
Behind Elspeth, master Allusis and the other Jedi enters the bridge. The elderly Jedi Master walks up to her, with obvious concern in his eyes.

Willum settles in towards the doors out of the crews' way, opening himself to the Force to better take in the data his mind needed to think his way through to a solution, if only for his own satisfaction. Shortly after doing so he receives a rarity-- he finds himself surprised. ***The Jedi next to him who had jumped at the alarm is– two people?!? What?*** He turns to stare somewhat open mouthed in shock at the young man.

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **zenkatarn** (2010-03-10 10:22:27)

*"The Sith aren't really known for favoring negotiations over invasion, now are they? But you never know, and Master Allusis has a point."*
Neku glanced over his shoulder at Yoshiya as he said this, thinking, *Yeah, I see what you mean. Still, can't hurt to hope, right?*
Yoshiya smiled in his slightly condescending way and said, *"Actually, it technically can."*
*Oh shut up, you know what I mean.* With that, Neku returned his attention to the situation at hand, staying alert to any way he could help.

The baroness turns slightly in her seat at the Jedi Master's approach, barely hiding a grimace.
"I suppose you Jedi have some suggestions? Go ahead, I'm listening."
For an instant she turns back to look at her helmswoman.
"Close in on them, but stay out of effective weapons' range."

---

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-10 11:09:54)

Allusis shakes his head and raises his hands in front of him.
"While Jedi have been known to influence the outcome of battles through the power of their minds, I am not one of them. This is you arena captain, not ours, but if we can be of assistance we will do what we can"
As the ship blasted forward in space, soon two large figures became visible in the distance. They were moving closer, but their speed appeared to have decreased somewhat. Suddenly, a series of bright flares, barely visible to the eye over the great distance erupted in space near the Sith ships.
The systems operator called for Elspeth´s attention.
"Captain, we register multiple energy signatures emerging from the ships. They have launched fighters!"

### **Anonymous** (2010-03-10 11:34:04)

Elspeth looks at the plot and nods.
"I see them. Alright, go to General Quarters and raise shields, I doubt we'll be able to avoid action."
She furrows her brow in consternation at the plot, as if calculating something.
"Any word on the two cruiser analogs' class? Armements? Size?"
"Navigation, start plotting a hyperspace jump to the nearest friendly system."

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **zenkatarn** (2010-03-10 12:23:41)

*"Called it."* Yoshiya said, nodding his head slowly as though he had predicted this outcome.
*Right, because you're the only one in the room who thought they might attack.* Neku rolled his eyes at his spirit companion. As battle began to draw ever closer, he began tapping his foot against the floor. At first it was too soft for the others to hear, but it quickly grew in speed and volume as Neku became more anxious.
Yoshiya frowned, saying, *"Calm down, Neku. There's nothing you can do to help, but if you become a distraction you'll only be a hindrance."*
Neku stopped tapping his foot and thought, *I know, I know. I just hate not being able to do anything!* He turned to Master Allusis and said, "Master, isn't there *some* way we can help?"

---

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-10 13:11:00)

"No milady, it seems they are deliberately staying out of our range. The only thing we can say for sure is that they are larger than us"
An operator next to the first speaker interrupted.
"Fighters inbound, two squadrons coming in at point oh-five, and another two following. ETA, 1 minute. Scanners indicates Imperial Interceptors - Lightly armed craft, but small, agile, and numerous"
Off to the side, Master Allusis turned his head to Neku.
"Patience, young Jedi. Is taking action just for the sake of it really better than taking no action at all? If we cannot find a way to contribute, our best course of action is to remain passive and alert for when the time to act comes"

---

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **zenkatarn** (2010-03-10 13:26:02)

Neku frowned stuck his hands in his pockets, resuming his foot tapping. Yoshiya shook his head and sighed, saying, *"Well then the time better come soon, or Neku might just lose it."*
Neku rolled his eyes at Yoshiya's comment and resisted the urge to begin pacing. He started trying to think of possible courses of action that would help in this situation. He quickly came to the conclusion that he was no better a tactician than he was a pilot or gunner.

Captain Duquesne taps the two cruisers on the plot with a finger.
"What are you doing? What are you waiting for? What are you hiding?." She asks no one in particular in a thoughtful tone.
Snapping out of her thoughts, she turns to her tactical officer.
"Miss Sereiko, you have permission to open fire on the fighters, target selection is at your discretion."
*Activate Jamming Array
Open fire with all weapons on the fighters when they get in range. If one of the fighters is destroyed while it has two or more adjacent fighters, use Explosive Shot. (Tell me if I should add the stats for the ship's weapons for posts like this one.)*

After his odd sensation about the jumpy Jedi, who was now tapping his foot impatiently, Willum returned to his meditation. He was useless in space, so unless things became quite grave and his suggestion of boarding and capturing one of the cruisers came up he would simply stay out of the way.
He began to analyze the strange sensation surrounding the jittery young Jedi, wracking his brain for any stray hint in his memory and searching through the Force.

The small fighter craft streaked towards the ship like a wasp swarm, scattering effortlessly out of harm´s way as the main turbolasers opened fire against them. Assuming attack formation, the small craft began opened fire with their cannons, and the ship shuddered slightly at the assault. In response, the Calliopes broadside batteries filled the space with fire, and four of the enemy craft turned into little more than space debris. They still circled the ship though, swift and agile as flies, lasers hammering on the shields, and behind them was a second wave incoming.
In the distance, the cruisers hung quiet, two massive silhouettes against space.
Trying to recall anything he has been learned, Willum finds that he has never heard of anything like what he felt in the other Jedi, and he has no idea what it means.

### **Thraken** (2010-03-11 18:45:07)

*This is very strange. They're sending interceptors at us, down one sixth strength already and their Cruisers are hanging back. It'd take a lot more pounding from interceptors to even deal appreciable damage to our shields.*
Solon thinks back, through all the fleet actions he's been a part of, and the times he has fought the Sith...

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-12 19:58:58)

"Yes, captain, entering orbital trajectory now to match the cruisers current speed and direction"
Even though the superior targeting systems and numerous guns of the Calliope continued to pump out heavy streams of fire in overlapping arcs, it seemed the vaporizing explosions of the enemy fighters became fewer and fewer in between. It seemed almost as if the fighters was content to sweep across the hull of the ship, dodging laser cannons like some kind of sport. They had broken formations, and were swarming the ship like an atomic cloud, their low-powered lasers taking shots only when a vital target presented itself, continuously being stopped by the shields.
Both Elspeth and Solon, experienced and well-versed in fleet tactics, stood confused by the Imperial actions. It was clear that their fighters lacked the power to pierce the Calliopes shields, and yet they had launched four full squadrons of ships to lead the assault without the support of the larger ships. Either they had something planned, or they were simply quite incompetent...but how to know which?

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **Magical2099** (2010-03-13 09:10:11)

Upon finding himself drawing a complete blank on the odd Jedi's strange aura, Willum lapsed back into his old habit of assuming the worst.
**"They are stalling. This reminds me of a street charlatan waving one hand around to keep you from noticing the "disappeared" whatnot going up his sleeve,"** Willum says, knowing there is a chance he's wrong and hoping he is. **"They are either content with our current actions because they're inserting troops on the other side of the planet, awaiting delivery of something from the planet, waiting for allies to fall into position, or waiting for a saboteur to cripple critical systems on board here. Or any number of other dreadful things, for that matter. I'll be waiting in the hanger bay, mayhap I can lend a hand there."**
Willum turns to leave the bridge and begins taking stock of his personal belongings of merit, trying to decide if anything left in his quarters warranted getting before finding something of use to do in the hanger.

"Those fighters are like gnats, a distraction. The cruisers are hanging back, either because they don't have the firepower to take us out or because they are hiding something. My gut tells me its the latter." She turns to the Jedi Master. "Normally, I would proceed on my own autority, but you did tell me I was under your command. I don't know what you had planned exactly, but if I go ahead we'll probably take a serious licking."

Neku seemed like he was about to say something, but he stopped himself, as if reconsidering his suggestion. As he did, Yoshiya asked him, *"What is it? You think of something?"*
*Well, yeah…* Neku replied, *But it's probably stupid. I was thinking we could get in one of the ship's escape pods and launch ourselves at the cruisers, allowing us to avoid putting a pilot in danger…but then I realized it sounded kinda dumb.*
Yoshiya stared at Neku for a few seconds before saying, *"You know Neku? You're right. That **does** sound stupid."*
Neku frowned and replied, *Oh, who asked you? I said it was a bad idea, didn't I?*

"I did say that, didn´t I?"
The old man smiled.
"In situations like this, captain, you may take whatever measures you finds necessary. But I agree with you, there is something strange over this whole maneuver..."
He closed his eyes for a moment, and seemed to be entering some sort of trance. A few moments later, he opened his eyes again.
"There´s...a disturbance in the Force. But it is not centered around the Sith cruisers...it is closer"

"Oh sorry. That might be me. I have that affect on people sometimes." Neku said when the Jedi Master mentioned a disturbance in the Force.

As Elspeth moves over to the helmswoman, Master Allusis stands still for a moment, as if wondering over something. Then he snaps out of his thoughts and holds out a warning hand towards her.
"Wait a moment captain..."
He walks over towards the systems operator and looks at the screens with a concerned look. After a few moments, he points towards the battle map, and a sector closer to the planets orbit.
"Forget the cruisers for a moment, focus the scanners here. It´s fleeting and elusive, but it´s there"
The operator looks a little bit confused, but he is apparently not about to argue with a Jedi Master, and gets to work. After a few moments, he looks a bit surprised at the instruments and turns directly to Elspeth.
"Milady! Scanners are picking up two small craft headed for the planet. Class and type are unknown, but they appear to be sizable enough to hold a small landing force. Their signature is barely visible, they must be using some sort of cloaking device"

The astonished captain immediately turns to the system's operator and the Jedi Master next to him.
"WHAT!?"
She stares blankly at the plot for a moment before regaining her composure.
"I want an intercept course on those landing crafts, now!" She says to lieutenant Alys Basai before turning to her tactical officer. "Forget the fighters. Re-prioritize your targets with those two stealthed crafts as primaries. I know they'll be hard targets, but just fill their trajectory with as much weapon's fire as possible."

*Not me I guess…* Neku thought, actually somewhat relieved that he wasn't the disturbance in the Force the Master had sensed. He still felt pretty useless in the current situation, but at least now something was happening. He decided to reach out in the Force to sense what it was that Master Allusis felt, even though it was likely futile.

The ship swung about sharply, as it accelerated to try and catch up with the stealthy craft. The cannons forgot all about the fighters, and turned their attention to filling the area with crossfire. A blast seemed to strike something, and a massive explosion erupted, revealing one of the landing craft, supposedly having damaged its cloaking device.
Neku reached out into the Force, and he felt a weak, tingling presence emanating from one of the shuttles.
Suddenly the ship rocked violently, apparently struck by something heavy. While the shields were still intact, it seemed the cruisers had finally opened fire.

Elspeth grabs the back of a nearby seat to stabilize herself.
"Alright, concentrate fire with the laser batteries on the exposed shuttle. Retarget the turbolaser batteries on one of those cruisers. I'm afraid we can't do more at the moment."
With those words, she sits back down in her command chair.

"Um..." Neku started to say something, but halted himself before he could complete a full sentence.
*"What's up, Neku?"* Yoshiya asked, puzzled by Neku's partial thought.
*Well, I was thinking maybe we could take a shuttle down to the planet and defend it from whoever's aboard that landing craft…*
*"So suggest it. What's the problem here?"* Yoshiya interrupted his brother, annoyed at Neku's hesitation.
*…Right…* Neku turned to face the captain and said, "Um, excuse me. Captain Elspeth, was it? Why don't we, meaning the Jedi and I, take a shuttle down to the planet and deal with the Sith landing party?"

"Duquesne" She says to Neku in a chiding tone. "And the Calliope doesn't have those capabilities. We can land for a short time though and if Master Allusis permits it, I have a mission for you Jedi. It would benefit the Republic greatly if we could capture that stealth shuttle intact and I intend to drop you off with whatever men I can spare for that very objective."

"Oh. Right...sorry." Neku half-turned his head to glare over his shoulder at Yoshiya, thinking, *You knew there weren't any shuttles, didn't you?*
Yoshiya shrugged, his condescending smile fixed in place, *"Of course, why do you ask?"*
*Then why'd you let me make a fool of myself like that!?* Neku mentally asked.
*"Because if I don't let you screw up once in a while, you'll never learn. I have to let you make your own mistakes sometimes, right? And making a fool of yourself in public seemed like a safer mistake then, say, stepping into a minefield."*
*That was one time, and I was distracted, okay!?*

"We'll be under fire the whole way." Solon steps up, objecting.
"The time it would take for a full landing procedure would make Calliope an extremely easy target for attack. If would be much faster if we make a rapid exit from hovering over the landing site. Say, using ropes or other equipment to make planetfall."

Captain Duquesne quirks an eyebrow.
"Who said anything about "full landing procedures"? This will have to be a combat landing. Besides, unless they have a death wish and follow us into the atmosphere, we'll be quite safe from their fire."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-22 19:23:55)

With one of the shuttles exposed, the Calliope´s batteries turns their fire against it, but the shuttle is surprisingly agile for its size, or maybe the pilot is just aces. Whichever it is, few shots strikes the nimble craft, and even fewer seems to do any real damage. The fighters seemed to gather in response to the shuttle being an obvious target, forming up in an escort formation around it, losing to of their own ships to the heavy fire.
Having stayed silent in thoughts for a few moments, Jedi Master Allusis seems to be in agreement with Elspeth.
"I wouldn´t count on them having any qualms about firing into the atmosphere, captain. After all, *we* are the ones flying over a friendly planet. Once we are clear, try to draw the fighters away from the planet, and if possible bring the battle to the Sith"
Looking at the rest of the Jedi gathered at the bridge, he motions for them to follow.
"Any personnel you could spare would be appreciated of course, but we can handle ourselves if necessary. We´ll be standing ready to drop from one of the cargo holds on your command. May the Force be with you"
On his way down from the bridge, Allusis picks up a comlink, and sends a transmission to Willum.
"Meet us at the aft cargo hold. We´re going down to the planet"

Neku double-checked his sabers as he followed the master to the hanger bay. He was glad to finally have something to do, though he wished it didn't involve risking the civilians planet-side. *Looks like we're getting some action after all.*
*"So it appears. Stay sharp, Neku. We've never faced an actual Sith before, so we don't really know what we're about to be put up against."* Yoshiya cautioned, his normal smile replaced by an expression of grim anticipation.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-27 11:08:45)

"Yes milady. Changing course now"
The Calliope streaks down towards the planet, matching course and speed with the landing crafts. Several of the fighters that closed up to protect the shuttles breaks their formation, veering back towards the ship, lacing her with laserfire. The Calliope´s gunners are hesitant to return fire as the ship breaches into the atmosphere, but the shields seems to be holding.
"We have spotted the shuttles captain. They have settled down on an empty landing pad near the planet´s main spaceport. Most likely trust us not to fire upon them at such a location. Preparing to descend for emergency drop...now"
The ship dives pretty steeply towards the surface, and in the forwards viewport, the city below becomes clearer and more visible. Elspeth can clearly see the spaceport and the landed shuttles near it. The ship slows down considerably and levels out, and a systems operator speaks into the comlink.
"Deactivating shields now. Strike team, ready to go"
=============================================================
Having reached the cargo hold, Master Allusis and the remaining Jedi hears the voice over the comlink, and in the next moment they see a small distortion in the blue force field covering the exit of the hold, and understands the shields are down. Outside you can see the sprawling city around you, and straight ahead is the spaceport.
Producing a metallic cylinder from withing his robes, the Jedi Master turns to the young Jedi with him.
"Are you ready?"
Without waiting for an answer, he moves over to the open hatch, and jumps out of sight.

**"Finally, no more worries,"** Willum says, more to himself than his companions, as he draws his Dueling Saber and Lightwhip with a flourish and swan dives from the open cargo bay.
*This is **GLORIOUS**!!!* he thinks as he plummets towards the surface of the planet, reveling in the action to come. In battle alongside other Knights he doesn't have to worry about any one but himself, and since he's practically never concerned with his own safety, battle is his only escape from his over-active imagination and crushing sense of duty. The ear-to-ear grin looks out of place on his face, and doubly so due to the circumstances surrounding him.
He takes in as much of the scenery as possible before preparing for his landing.

Neku stood on the edge of the opening in the hanger bay, looking down on the city below through it. He wasn't especially afraid of heights, but we wasn't fond of the idea of jumping out of a moving spaceship. "How exactly are we supposed to get down there without breaking our necks?" he muttered, his voice rendered inaudible by the winds outside the ship.
*"Well, the first step is to jump, Neku."* Yoshiya informed him.
"Yeah, no problem right? Just jump, then land without killing yourself. Easy for you to say, bro."
*"Yeah, it is."* Yoshiya then gave Neku a little nudge through the Force, causing his brother to lose his balance and fall out of the hanger with a shout of surprise. *"See you at the bottom, Neku!"*

The three Jedi dropped from the ship and landed behind Master Allusis. You can all see the Sith landing craft, a few hundred meters away or so, positioned next to what appears to be a large hangar. Undoubtedly, they´ve seen your landing (they´d have to be blind not to), but you don´t spot anyone headed towards you.
Just looking over his shoulder to see you landed safely, the Jedi Master points toward a paved path leading up towards the hangar. The place is on the outskirts of the spaceport area, with the main buildings behind you, so there´s very little objects or other buildings lining the path. A few trees, a low rock wall, and some scattered boulders in the free open.
"That seems to be the clearest path. We cannot be sure of their intentions, so I think we should intercept them as soon as possible. Let´s go"
=====================================================
Aboard the Calliope, Elspeth feels the ship shudder and shake. The enemy fighters must have seized their opportunity to strike when they had lowered their shields.
The ship swings heavily upwards, and accelerates fast to try and out as much ground as possible between them and...well, the ground.

Landing on his feet with only a faint thud Niachei continues moving, rolling neatly into a still kneeling position. He surveys the rather open area as Master Allusis gives his assessment. "That seems to be the clearest path. We cannot be sure of their intentions, so I think we should intercept them as soon as possible. Let´s go"
*Well. True enough. The logical thought from the situation would be that the landing party is hostile. But as a Jedi that cannot be taken for granted.*
**"Fast but cautious then."**
Solon pulls his own lightsaber from its belt clip. Mostly black due to its finned style grips, environment seals and three part emitter shroud, the metal casing appears only as silver highlights to the design. Plotting the positions of the sparse cover in his mind Solon makes a quiet dash toward the first piece of cover on his way to the hangar while ready to ignite and bring his lightsaber up at any time.

On the ground, the Jedi moves forward, cautiously but with haste. As you approach, you can see armored Sith soldiers emerging from the shuttle. They do not appear focused on you for the moment, but a few of them are pulling heavy crates from the ship.
You are still too far away to see what might be in the crates.

"Understood. Plotting an intercept vector now"
The Calliope streaks towards the deep space, headed in the direction of the Sith cruisers. The starfighters seems to have decided that they would do best to keep their distance for now. Their mission had obviously been to distract the attention from the two landing craft, and now that their mission had been accomplished, a continued engagement of the Calliope would be nothing short of suicide.
==============================================
As the Jedi moves towards the Sith landing party, master Allusis turns to give a quick glance towards Willum.

Heeding master Allusis´s waring, the small Jedi group proceeds forward with caution towards the Sith landing party. Suddenly though, something flashed through the mind of the group that even the most untrained padawan could not have missed, and almost in unison you throws yourselves in different directions. A split second later, a high-powered blaster bolt passes right where you all just stood, and splashes into the ground behind, ripping up a crater and sending rubble and smoke everywhere.
As you look ahead, you see two Sith warriors operating a massive blaster cannon, and several others working on mounting a second. Other warriors have scrambled from the hangar behind, and you seems to have gotten yourself some trouble on your hands.

Willum recovers from the after shock of the blast and decides the Master's insistence on caution would get him killed rather quickly. He decides to do this the way he was taught, and draws deeply on the Force to amplify his natural speed. He activates his blade and whip, decision made and target chosen, he gives himself to the Force, trusting it to guide him. The image of his actions plays out in his head as he begins to move forward: he would land close to the trooper operating the live cannon, strike him down, and continue onward, past him and towards the troopers setting up the second cannon.

Letting his sudden unplanned momentum carry him Solon lets himself roll crouched on his feet. *A foolish approach.* His lightsaber's dark green blade flares to life and Solon is already in motion without pause. *In war one defeats the enemy.* Close the distance before they can fire again. He is sprinting. *We are soldiers. Our code demands we fight for the oppressed*. Out of line from the cannons, stop at point blank range. *So driven towards killing the enemy, are we Jedi any more?* Each battle since the start of the war the contradictions raged in his mind while his body moved to fight without without pause.

## Re: Chapter I - Darkness Revealed

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-05-03 18:14:36)

It appears that the Sith Cruisers are not really willing to take the fight up close with the Calliope. Obviously more veered for troop carrying than combat, the ships fires up their engines and enters a vector away from the planet. Apparently they are quite satisfied leaving the ground team as it is.
==============================================================
Obviously, the large cannon requires some time to heat up. While the gunner is apparently not the most skilled marksman with the big gun, it does spew out blaster bolts at a very hefty rate. With blaster bolts flying over their heads, the three young Jedi finds themselves whipping their lightsaber ferociously to fend away the bolts. *Neku takes 9 damage*
Being the fleetest on his feet, Solon rushes through the hail of blasterfire with his lightsaber flashing. Spotting the soldiers coming from the hangar behind to join the gunners, he heads directly for them. As he brings his saber in for a strike though, the front soldier bends his knees and jolts forward, bringing an armored shoulder straight into the charging Jedi who barely manages to roll out of the way. *Solon takes 6 damage*
Halting short, the two closest soldiers drops to their knees, lining up their rifles against the new threat. Luckily, the first soldier is quite in the way for them, and only a single bolt comes even close to Solon, which he easily parries with his saber.
Quickly recovering from his body tackle, the Sith soldier stands up nearly face-to face with Solon, and fires from the hip. Something he shouldn´t have done, since it´s hard to aim like that, and the shot goes wide.
Moving with the speed of the Force, Willum races forward, and picking up speed he takes a small leap up on one of the crates unloaded by the Sith and pushes away as he throws himself against the opponent, saber coming down. The massive cannon is somewhat in the way though, and he overleaps his opponent, diving into a roll and coming up continuing towards the soldiers setting up the second cannon.
Coming up on the battle scene, Neku finds several interesting opportunities. Solon engaged with the oncoming Sith soldiers, Willum rushing towards the not-yet-operational cannon, and several battle-ready soldiers just itching to get that final shot which will end the battle.
(Sorry about the delay. I´ve been trying to make a good map, but I´m really poor at anything graphical. You´ll have something that looks like crap soon enough though <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: --> )

*Twip* The hard pauldron clips Solon and with a grunt he rolls off to the side. Flowing with his momentum again he bats aside a blaster bolt to stand and face a wide shot from his new friend. *Someday the Force may decide not to let those shots stray anymore*. His mind still churning with useless noise he moves immediately regardless to plow a lightsaber through his neighbouring Sith Trooper.
With a moment of solid footing Solon flips into the air. Aiming for a better position as he upends and turns, he shifts to a lesser used two-hand grip as he whips his lightsaber around and strikes diagonally down at the Sith.

Neku holds his arm out to his side and releases his grip on his lightsaber. He then immediately catches it again, using the Force, and sets it to spinning in midair. Taking in the situation in a glance, he sends his saber in to attack one of the enemies aiming at Solon. The spinning saber flies parallel to the ground, aiming to cut its target in half at the waist. Meanwhile, Neku positions his guard shoto so that he can quickly block any attack directed at him while directing his floating saber.

Obviously surprised by the speed of Willum´s attack, the Sith soldier manning the cannon is obviously too well-drilled to let it show. With the Jedi scattering, he takes his aim on the one still withing the firing arc of the cannon: Neku. This time though, the young Jedi is more prepared for the assault, and avoids the assault easily.
Fluidly recovering from the violent tackle, Solon leaps into the air, bringing his lightsaber down two-handed against the soldier, and scores a violent hit against the biceps of his opponent, causing him to cry out in pain.
As the soldier staggers to the side, another hailfire of blaster bolts from his comrades strikes at Solon. Still recovering from his massive attack, the Jedi barely gets his lightsaber up in time to deflect the bolts. *Solon takes 16 damage*
The struck soldier is clearly in pain, and staggers away from Solon. As he catches his breath, he swings around and lines up his rifle for another shot. But the injury clearly oains him, and the shot goes wide.
The second character manning the cannon sees an opportunity to strike as Willum drops down behind him and his companion. Hoping to catch the Jedi unable to defend himself, he fires a spray of bolts at the Jedi, and is profoundly surprised as Willum get up from his roll with the lightsaber swinging widely to bat away the shots.
Willum spins around on his feet, pushing away towards his missed target, and lashes out with the lightwhip. The weapon strikes forward, and twirls around the legs of his target, and as he jerks it, the soldier falls onto his back as the Jedi approaches him.
Dropping his lightsaber, Neku sends it flying through the Force, directed towards the soldier that Solon wounded. The saber flies at full speed, like a disc of energy spinning towards the waist of the Sith. He tries to dodge out of the way, but the saber still clips him in the side, and he nearly falls over.

The prone soldier sees the Jedi approach him, and does the only thing he can do and lashes out with his feet, but the nimble Jedi easily flips into the air and avoids the attack.
Solon moves quickly, jumping and dodging blasterfire, and his lightsaber swings in a clear arc down upon his already wounded foe, and this time he won´t be getting up anytime soon.
Readily determined to take down the approaching Jedi, the soldiers fires a single burst of shots each, before retreating back a few steps. The crossfire is heavy, and if the Jedi had hoped for a moment of peace in the eye of the storm he is sorely mistaken as he has his hands full with deflecting away blaster bolts. *Solon takes 22 damage*
Shaken upon the sight of their allies falling before the Jedi, the soldiers operating on the second cannon abandons their efforts and takes off at great speed towards the hangar.
The assisting crewman at the first cannon backs away a few more steps to take his shot at Willum. But hitting a Jedi somersaulting in midair is easier said than done, and the shot flies straight into the sky.
Taking flight, Willum twirls through the air, and brings his saber down hard against his target, who barely manages to roll out of the way, and the energy blade stabs him through the shoulder. You´d expect him to pass out from the pain, but the high-pitched cry tells you he probably didn´t.
Feeling his grip on the lightsaber slip, Neku decides to call back the weapon to his hand, rather than having it fall to the ground.

"Milady, we´ve left low orbit and are unable to communicate with the ground crew. If we push it to the max, we might catch the ship before they leaves, but it will be close"
Though at maximum range, the cannons on the ship begins to pump bright energy lances into space, though it is impossible to judge if they even reached the enemy before dissipating.

Willum sees the shot fly wide and after hearing the soldier's cry decides to deal with his still-standing comrade. He dashes towards him, Lightwhip snaking forward, hoping to place himself properly to take advantage of either of the soldiers' foolish decisions.

The mental diarrhoea his mind constantly churned out is absent, replaced by dull thudding as his fatigued body continues to flail his lightsaber around to ward off blasterbolts. Planting his feet solidly into the ground he regains his balance and surges forward to engage one of his attackers
(standard action and burn a Force Point to gain a +5 Competence Bonus to skill checks)
(move to melee range of the trooper near the second cannon)
(UtF +15 to Deflect or Block attacks, If any actually fire deflectable shots aim for the other trooper off to my right)
