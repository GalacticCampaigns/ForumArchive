# [Growing Shadows] Chapter Two: Before the Storm

### **Alicia** (2010-10-29 10:16:32)

The next couple days come and go. With quarters arranged for you on the Valiant (even for Tanith and Tendau), you find most of your essential needs have been provided for. It may deemed unfortunate that the rooms are not singles, instead Yuri, Drem and Sajin find themselves bunking with each other and Tendau and Tanith assigned a bunk together.
The *Titan's Valiant* resumes it's original mission mandated by the Republic to patrol their quadrant of the Outer Rim, a mission you learn about easily should you decide to ask. It would also be learned Captain Prius hasn't revealed the truth about the earlier operation to recover the Force Harvester providing only an adequate cover story meant to allay any suspicions from the rest of the crew.
Drem and Yuri begin their investigation of the supposed suspicious behavior of Jensen and his colleagues. An ongoing investigation as answers will take longer than they first supposed.
Tanith finds himself the subject of awe as he comes into the pilot's area and breaks the current hot shot's pilot record in only try. While the young pilot isn't very happy about it he actually takes it good naturedly, learning from the experience. Either to Tanith's agitation or amusement the pilots' take it upon themselves to bombard the veteran pilot with questions on maneuvers and for tales of his adventures.
For Tendau, aside from the six hour shifts requested of him to guard the armory where the Harvester has been stored, his days are rather quiet; spent how he pleases in meditation on board Ka'ra's ship. Only once is his presence requested by Ka'ra who meets him in the medbay several hours after the earlier ordeal. Sitting patiently in her tank and black trousers on the medbed, her arm still secure in the sling. Lanius stands to the side conversing with her up until the Ithorian healer enters at which point he nods a farewell to them both and leaves. During Tendau's ministrations she would sit calmly, barely saying a word aside from an initial apology and attempting to not make eye contact with the friend she had injured. Once he's done, unless he attempts to converse with her, she thanks him and then leaves for her quarters, not leaving again aside to get small meals she takes back to her quarters.
It's on the third day that you are summoned to the briefing room, the very same one where the initial briefing was given. Having dropped out of hyperspace, the crew seems to be getting things ready to investigate a local disturbance. Whether that has anything to do with why you're called is hard to determine from what you might hear from the crew as they go about their work.

A slight feeling of annoyance worms its way through Sajin, although the Nagai is very well practiced in not showing any emotion. Guarding the Force Harvester had been proceeding without a hitch, and there had yet to be any sign of their being pursued, but the Jedi Shadow fervently hopes that this stopping for a "local disturbance" was an isolated event. When you are flitting around the galaxy with an artifact capable of threatening billions, contract disputes and pirate raids should be the least of your concerns.
Taking a calming breath, Sajin releases the frustration and instead contents himself with gazing around the conference room. This had been his first tour within a Republic cruiser, and the cleanliness and functionality of the design pleases his aesthetic senses. The smooth woodgrain of the conference table, the deeply couched swivel chairs and the holoprojector at the center of it all, it was as if the comfort of the room grew out of its function rather than being at the forethought of the design.
Sajin runs his fingers along the grooves of the table as he sits thinking and awaiting everyone to gather. He had made sure to arrive early and inspect the room first, punctuality and old, life-saving habits getting the better of him. There was nothing to cause any alarm, and neither did he really expect there to be any, but still the Jedi prefers to be overly cautious when he can afford to be. When the others do begin to arrive, he gives them each a passing acknowledgement, but remains mostly silent until their briefing begins.

Striding into the conference room after wondering the halls of the republic cruiser for a few minutes to pass the time, the ithorian notices Sanjin has already arrived and is sitting patiently waiting for the briefing. As he enters he returns the nod of acknowledgement and takes a seat two chairs over from the Jedi shadow to his right. After sitting he says to the other Jedi,  **I can't place it Sanjin, but something about this disturbence doesn't feel right… Of all the ships to dispatch to a boarder dispute they choose to send the one carrying a weapon of mass destruction? It doesn't sit well with me…** Tendau trAils off in thought waiting for his companions response.

Tanith enjoys the distraction provided by the younger fighter pilots on board, doing his best to teach them something and improve their skills. He spends hours upon hours in the sims, almost as happy to have something to do as to be flying. When the call goes out for the meeting he heads in the appropriate direction and takes a seat at the table across from the two Jedi. He gives them polite nods but leaves his attention on the sim data he is pouring over, data dealing with recent improvements to Republic bombers. He leaves them their discussion, choosing to wait till more of the group was present before speaking up.

Captain Niandra Prius strides into the conference room and glancing around appears to be rather annoyed at the fact the others had yet to arrive. Taking a position at the head of the table, she pulls out a datachip inserting it into the holo-projector controls. The projector reacts by turning on, a blue light coalescing about the display, the projector's version of static.
"**I suppose we'll wait for the others to arrive. I hate having to repeat myself,**" she says, taking her seat and gazing at the two Jedi and pilot, giving them a nod of acknowledgment to their presence.

Arriving just in time to hear the captain´s words, Yuri turns towards Prius, offering a bow.
**"My apologies captain, everything in this place looks the same, and you can´t really separate the briefing rooms from the storage facilities until you get inside"**
He could feel some annoyance in her, and he hoped the lighthearted joke could make it disappear. If course, the smile on his face as he said it just might bring it back. Well, at least it sounded better than saying that he overslept. Which he technically hadn´t, since he had been in a trance. Anyway, he took a seat at the table, nodding a greeting to his companions.
He adjusted slightly to make himself more comfortable with the small holster on his lower back. He had considered shifting to carrying the saber on his belt instead, though he still didn´t want to brand himself as a Jedi more than necessary. He wasn´t sure how far word had reached yet. Lanius knew of course, and he suspected Ka'ra did too. He wasn´t sure about the rest of his companions though, but him being recruited to help guard the Force Harvester should have tipped them of that he had some connection to the Force. His displayed attitude towards Jedi would probably discourage people from thinking him one, though.
It wasn´t that he didn´t trust them, but information had a way of getting around on its own, and he didn´t want it to get out more than necessary. Just because he had gotten a more permanent assignment than usual, it didn´t mean he would give up his search for the Sith.

Bursting into the conference room like a herd of gundarks, Drem stopped almost too short when he realized where he was. **"Sorry … >*pant*< … was on the other …>*gasp*< … side of the ship when I got ..>*pant*< .. got the comm. This ship is far too big … I might need a speeder to get from one side to the other …"** It was obvious that Drem had gotten quite comfortable on the ship, as he showed up in a black t-shirt and green pants, which bore a gold stripe down the sides. And, while he was wearing his usual belt, his holster wasn't attached to it. He did, however, remember his tan workers gloves, which were tucked into the belt, and the various assortment of rocks and amulets that were a constant around his neck.
Looking around, he found a seat and quickly slid into, and almost out of, it. Taking a quick minute, he shifted a bit to and fro, making himself more comfortable before finally looking up and attentive to the Captain. **"Sorry … Please continue."** He shifted again, just for good measure, before crossing his legs and providing his full attention.

Captian Prius was about to either reprimand those who appeared tardy, or make a further comment when her words are cut short by the beeping of her comm. Pulling out an earbud commlink she sets in her ear before activating it. "**Prius**," she says into it and seems to listen for a moment. "**Has the pilot declared intent?**" There's another pause as Prius stands to move to the side of the room. "**Ka'ra huh? Alright, let him board, but dispatch a security team. Notify Bralor she has company.**" The middle-aged captain, with her crisp uniform and dire bun looks contemplative for a moment before returning to her earlier task of the meeting.<div style="text-align: right;">
![830px-Nyriaan-goi.jpg](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100706001213/starwars/images/thumb/5/5f/Nyriaan-goi.jpg/830px-Nyriaan-goi.jpg)
</div>

She walks back to her position at the table, but remains standing as she looks at each of you before speaking. "**Thank you all for coming. Something has arisen that has my superiors in a bind, and given the short notices, I've asked Lanius and Ka'ra to lend me your services in this time of need.**" Pausing for a moment her gaze continues to move from each member at the table. "**Two agents have gone missing on a hostile mining world in the Mid Rim.**" The static image on the holoprojector springs to life at the press of a button, the display now showing a planet from orbit.
"**The world, Nyriaan is a curious place, mostly because of its unique and volatile atmosphere that, when combined with its unusually strong magnetic field, makes landing on the planet a most hazardous endeavor.**" The planet projected has a layer of roiling clouds, dark, and forbidding clouds, punctuated by flashes of purple lightning which arc through the turbulant atmosphere.
"**The two missing agents were working toward the same goal in separate capacities. It seems that Czerka Corporation has been developing a device that can, if it performs as expected, condense all the moisture in Nyriaan's atmosphere into a single, catastrophic rainfall. While such an event might neutralize the planet's strong ionosphere, it would have the side effect of laying waste to much of the planet's surface, as well as killing most of the indigenous animal and plant species. We are not in the business of allowing such egregious expirements to proceed, regardless of the long-term benefit to our own mining efforts of Nyriaan. Therefore, we must stop Czerka from carrying out this project**." Sitting, Captain Prius folds her hands out in front of her on the table as she continues.
"**So, in brief, this is your assignment. Proceed to Nyriaan in the guise of independent miners. Ka'ra has provided use of her ship in this endeavor, so you can't be immediately be traced back to the Republic. Locate our missing agents in Locus, the capital.**" She turns a small nozzle and the view of the planer zooms in past the clouds showing a terrain map of the planet which small flags with names indicating points of interest. Locus appearing larger than the others and highlighted in red. "**Determine the location of Czerka's experimental device, and sabotage or, preferably, destroy it. If you are able to find comprehensive plans for the device, I know you will be compensated for the endeavor.**
"**I understand that this sounds like a simple mission, but there have been … complications,**" she says after a short pause as if she'd been searching for the right word. "**It seems that one or both of our agents might have been turned by Czerka. In their last reports to my superious, each agent claimed the the other was compromised by the enemy, so you must take care when dealing with either of them.**
"**Questions?**"

Yuri listens to the briefing, and as he takes in the information, there is one thing that strikes him as a bit odd. The captain has consistently failed to specify both the specialty of these agents, as well as their exact mission. While he supposes it might just have been a simple omission, it seems like it could be possible hat they are being withheld the full truth. He decides to press a little deeper on the matter.
**"If possible, I´d like to know a little more about your missing agents, Captain. While names, appearances and such would be useful, I am quite interested in what kind of agents they are. Diplomats? Spies? Saboteurs? Or were they perhaps sent to the planet even before you learned about this device, and in that case, what was their mission?"**
He leans back in his chair, adjusting the knife sheath on his side a bit.
**"This would all be useful information to have in case we need to interact with them"**

## Re: Chapter Two: Children of the Tempest

### **Alicia** (2010-11-04 20:55:03)

Apparently unsurprised by the line of Yuri's questioning, Prius switches the display from the image of the planet to the image of a human female who appears to be in her late twenties with short brown hair and brown eyes. "**Klieri has been operating on Nyriaan for the last four months.**" After letting those gathered get a good look she presses another button so the display changes to show a middle-aged Transdoshan with yellow brown scales, blood red eyes and a jagged scar along the left side of his head, the latter visible as the image projection rotates. "**Along with Yrssk, the two of them were posing as freelance mining personnel at the time of their disappearance. I will have their last addresses and information sent to the *Atin Oya'ka*.** "
She sets the projector to show both images as she continues. "**Neither of them showed any inclination for disloyalty to the Republic, and were specialists in covert investigations. They were working seperately to get more information on the environmental device Czerka is working on. My superiors had received word from outside sources of what Czerka was developing and was deemed important enough to send the agents.**"

**"A little shore leave is never a bad thing, eh? I'm game, though what use I'll be is beyond me. I do have a request though, Captain. It can wait till the briefing is done though. When do we leave?"** Tanith says as he lays the datapad down. Working with the pilots had been fun but they hadn't let him in an actual ship. The chance to fly again, even just down to the surface was something he couldn't turn down.
**"Oh, and here. You're welcome,"** he says as he slides the datapad towards the Captain showing the recent improvements of scores for the fighter squadrons. He gives her his lopsided grin as he leans back, waiting for the meeting to end.

Scooting closer to the holovid of the planet, Drem looked it over, attempting to take in as much of the image that he could. Absently drawing his finger around the holo-planet's surface, he asked, **"Were they wearing any type of locater badge? How about their last known coordinates?"** Thinking a moment, he continued his barrage of questioning. **"What's the main exports of the world? If Czerka's there, then chances are something valuable is also there. How do they ship in and out?"** Slipping out of the chair, he leaned across the table, looking at another of the holo-planet's angles, realizing how odd the question might have sounded. **"I mean as far as getting the supplies they need in and exporting out. I realize it's probably by ship, but how do they fly them in and out on a regular basis? I don't know of many freighter captains that would be stoopa enough to charge in like a gundark."** Looking to Tanith, the scout smiled and corrected himself, **"Present company excluded, of course."**
I'd like to roll my Knowledge (Galactic Lore) +8 to see if Drem would know anything else about Nyriaan.

Listening to the others question the captain thoroughly the ithorian leans forward in his chair and takes a del breath clearing his mind of distractions. Focusing on the ebb and flow of the force he brings his keen mind to bear on the problems being discussed on hand.  **If we are making a foray planet side I will require emergency medical supplies, I am currently out of my own. If I may obtain some from the ships stores captain? I know they will come in handy should things get rough. As for details of my comrades questions if you could upload them to the ships data logs so I can continue reviewing the details as we head planetside that would be much appreciated.** After finishing his bit, Tendau sits back in the chair and awaits the good captain's response.

Captian Prius glances at the datapad Tanith puts before her, but then sets it down again with little interest. "**You may leave when you're ready,**" she says in response to the pilot's question. Her attention turns back to Drem, glancing down at a couple flimsiplast sheets before she answers. "**The information you've asked for is available in a data packet I've had sent to the ship, but to summarize, Nyriaan is rich in madilon, an ore which has been used in hyperdrive research to miniaturize them. Because of the storms, it wasn't until recently that the planet's surface was accessible. Using a system of orbit anchored gondolas most of their goods are transported off the surface, although more recently laser transport arrays have been installed to aid ships in landing and taking off. Travel to and from the surface is still quite dangerous so I would suggest extreme caution.**"
"**As for supplies, I have authorized the quartermaster to make ready some gear you may find useful on this mission. Master Tendau, you will need to speak to our medical staff to see what they can spare. Also …**" she starts, but her last thought is interrupted by the doors to the conference room opening and then closing behind the fully armored Ka'ra.
"**My apologies Captain for interrupting,**" the young woman says, her voice booming out via the external speakers. "**But there's another I would like to add to this team.**" The captain's response is a frown at the surprise addition, but she doesn't interrupt Ka'ra as the younger woman continues. "**I've already briefed him on the purpose of this mission, and since I will not be participating… Well, there's no one better qualified to take my place.**"
Prius's response is at first only a nod as she turns her attention back to the others gathered. "**I have no objections to this late addition, Ka'ra, though I will leave it to the team you have gathered to be the final arbiter.**" The holoprojector turns off with a swift manipulation of the controls and then she removes the datachip. "**Provided there are no further pressing questions?**" she asks, though apparently she heartily believes the briefing was now over. "**Should you find the data sent to be inadequate please let Ka'ra know.**" Her belongings gathered the no-nonsense captain, takes her leave, exiting through into the hallway, where the others can see her nodding briefly through the open door to someone nearby before disappearing completely.

### **Yogi** (2010-11-07 22:42:28)

Garin walked smoothly through the door into the conference room that had just been vacated by the female Captain. Inside he saw Ka'ra with her back to him and 5 others at the table. ***Three other humans. A Nagai, interesting and one Ithorian. This will be different.*** With only a few strides he advances further into the room. Standing beside Ka'ra his helmet still as his eyes took in the room. The black, red and gray tones of his armor contrasted Ka'ra purple and black. The color differences told those that knew anything about the Mandalorian culture that they were from different clans. Despite not carrying any weapons in hand or holster at least two of the mounts on the arms are more than likely weapons that are always ready to use.
He gave those a nod at the table as he rested both hands on the high back of the chair in front of him. **"Garin Del-Fin."** He stated his name clearly as it came through the external speakers.

Turning to look at the newcomer, Drem stifled a sigh. *Another Mandalorian?* he thought. *At this rate, the whole damn Mandie army will be working with us.* Returning his attention to the matter at hand, the scout contemplated what Prius had said. **"Wouldn't it be easier to land on an orbital mining platform and transport ourselves down to the surface on one of the gondolas?"** As he said it, he began wondering about atmospheric shielding and life support, adding to his question in the process. **"I mean, sure, there might be some problems with shielding or life support … but I'm sure their maintenance has had to take the trip on occasion … beyond droids that is."**

## Re: Chapter Two: Children of the Tempest

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-11-10 14:57:34)

*Well, well…what have we here*
Yuri raised an eyebrow at the sight of the Mandalorian. Sure, two wasn´t a whole lot, but it seemed like it still hadn´t been that long since the wars ended for the Republic to be hiring them in any numbers. Of course, it could be that he wasn´t hired by the Republic, but by Ka'ra personally. He didn´t mind it though, as long as he was capable. And what he knew of Mandalorian culture told him that wouldn´t likely be an issue.
**"So, Garin, you have any suggestions on how to approach this mission?"**

## Re: Chapter Two: Children of the Tempest

### **Yogi** (2010-11-10 15:18:56)

Garin looked at the one that asked him about how to approach the mission. He gave a slight nod od his head in Ka'ra's direction. **"As Ka'ra mentioned she has only given me the brief background and why the mission is taking place. As for the mission specifics,"** He jerked a armored hand in the direction of the open door. **"I believe I only just missed that part of the briefing."**
He shifted slightly as he paused for a moment. **"Though I do have a comment on landing on the orbital platforms. While an option it would leave the team stranded on the planet with no way to leave quickly. Not to mention that while in transport we'd have a tactical disadvantage being isolated while descending or ascending. If the ship being used is sound and the pilot capable, landing on the planet might be the best option."**

## Re: Chapter Two: Children of the Tempest

### **Alicia** (2010-11-10 19:36:50)

Ka'ra gives the armored man a small nod in greeting as he comes up beside her to the table, before her head turns once more to place her attention on those gathered around the table. Her feet shift underneath her as she considers the questions, "**As for the mission itself, either taking the *Atin Oya'ka* down to the surface or taking a gondola are going to be equally risky, you will have to evaluate the pros and cons of either.**"
"**If you need more information, Captain Prius has already sent a data package ahead to the *Atin Oya'ka*. You can access it via the ship's main computer.**" Her helmeted head turns to glance at Garin for a moment before she adds, "**We'll be parting ways soon for a time, but we're likely to be rendezvousing at the conclusion of your mission.**"

## Re: Chapter Two: Children of the Tempest

### **Sketchpad** (2010-11-10 20:14:03)

Listening to the newcomer, Drem scoffed to himself. **"Boissa, he doesn't know us very well, does he?"** The scout quietly said to himself. Scratching the back of his neck, he raised his other hand in statement. **"Thing is, with the way that atmo is, even with a good pilot, we could end up in the same situation, unstooza?"**
Thinking for another moment, Drem pondered what could be found on such a planet. The scout in him was tickled for the idea to explore the area, but he fought to ground himself before he got too enthralled with the romanticized notion of what the mission could be. Taking a breath, he looked to the others and asked, **"So when do we leave?"**

### **jwol** (2010-11-11 09:44:16)

Listening to the options of descent being discussed Tendau tries to weigh the options, but his knowledge of such things is not as developed as others in the briefing, but he speaks up none the less.  **Being one who prefers these humble robes to atmospheric jump suits I believe the method of landing the Atin would be wisest, we would also have an exit plan and I know Tanith would most likely not become parted from her.** Smiling at the human he had traveled previously with he looked back to the captain,  **As for talking to your medical officers if you could leave me an authorization code or signed datapad or something so the staff knows I'm not talking malarky that would be greatly appreciated Captain.** Moving to his feet sensing the meeting was coming to a close the ithorian Jedi stands behind his seat and pushes it in resting his hands on the back and waiting patiently for the captains response.

*Time to prove why I'm the best. About damned time too. Wonder how many of 'em I can make soil themselves on the way down,* he thinks as he turns to look at the door leading out. **"The good Captain said we can leave when we're ready. Which for me is now. The lot of you?"** he asks.

Turning to Ka'ra he nodded. **"Like Tanith I'm also ready to depart. I trust that I can dock my fighter to the *Atin Oya'ka*? One other thing, meh gar jorhaa'ir ti gar vod, give her my message."** He said with some obvious mirth in his voice.

Nodding to voiced opinions of departure, the Mandalorian woman voices her own, "**You can leave whenever you wish. I know the captain has arranged for some supplies for you. You may want to take a look before you leave**." Her attention turns to Garin as she addresses him. "**It might be best if it was left here. The turbulence should the ship be taken into the atmosphere could cause some significant damage to the fighter.

Upon hearing Tanith's introduction of him Tendau realizes he had completely forgotten his manners.  **I apologize for my lack of manners Garin, my mind was wandering onto the supplies I would need to gather before our journey. My friend here spoke rightly, my name is Tendau Mimwen and it is a pleasure to meet you.**  After stammering his hasty apology the ithorian looked over to Ka'ra,  **I'm sure if she notified them or already has that I would be coming that would be sufficient, I just did not want to run into the same difficulties Myself and Tanith ran into at your former base with a very protective quartermaster. As for being ready, once our meeting has concluded and I've spoken with the medical staff and the ships provisioner I will be quite ready to head out.**

Placing both hands on the arm rests of his chair, Yuri pushed himself up and straightened out his cloak.

Walking towards the exit of the room, Yuri stopped at the newcomer.
**"As my friend already preceded me in saying, my name is Yuri Carkov, bounty hunter and…adventurer. But I´m sure we´ll get more chances to talk"**

Garin smiled under his helmet at the teasing that Ka'ra had given him. He already had something in mind as a reply but held it for the moment as the meeting seemed to be breaking up.
Garin stood back from the table as the Ithorian introduces himself as well as the one named Yuri who walked up to him and Ka'ra. It seemed to him that they all respected Ka'ra and that was a good thing. She may be young but he had a good head on her shoulders. It also spoke for them. Ka'ra wouldn't have worked with them if she had had any concerns about any of them.
He nodded at Yuri as he spoke of talking later. **"Agreed, I feel that we will have a bit of time to converse on our way there."**
He waited as the others filed out and walked with Ka'ra to the lift.

**"Eh, it can't hurt to check in with the quartermaster. Oh, and lass, I'll take *good* care of the *Atin* while we're gone. Promise, eh? Heh,"** Tanith tells Ka'ra with a wink as he makes his way from the meeting room headed for the commissary to see what gear is available. Even for a fighter pilot there's an amazing amount of cockiness in his walk, but like all hot hands on a stick it's a requirement. In order to be at the top of your game you have to believe you can't be beaten, that your only real competition is yourself. That way you always strive to be better, to beat your own already substantial performance record. Tanith may take cover in a firefight, may even fight as dirty as he can, may even cut and run if stuck in a hand to hand confrontation, but in the air, in the vacuum, he can't be beaten. *Atmosphere, eh? Sounds boring as hell. Maybe there'll be an asteroid belt or something close by. Those are entertaining, if only in their shock value, heh!* he thinks as he follows Yuri and Tendau to the quartermaster.

Laughing at Tanith's statement Ka'ra nods her head. "**I'm sure you'll take good care of the *Atin Oya'ka*, Mr. Hogra. I wish I could be coming with you, but Garin's arrival has shown me I have things I need to take care of back home.**" She says the last to both Tanith and Yuri. "**Jate'kara, ret'urcye mhi**," she says with a solemn bow of her head.
Among the last to leave, Ka'ra walks with Garin toward the lift. "**I'm sure if you wanted some of the gear the captain wouldn't have any issues with it,**" she says to him, pressing the command button which would take them back to the hanger bay. "**Not sure what all you brought with you, but I'd hate for you to ill prepared.**"
----------------------------------------------------------
Going your separate ways, Tendau finds himself in the lift with those heading to see the quartermaster, which happens to be on the same level as where the Force Harvester guard has been taking their turns with security outside a converted armory. The medbay is found easily enough as a blue marking on the wall leads the way to the emergency hub of the ship. The Mon Calamari soon finds himself in the midst of a small number of staff as they take care of every day occurrences related to the crew's health. Among them is Lanius's apprentice, Fiolla as she sits next to Kin's at his bedside. She looks up at the Jedi and gives him a small smile before going back to conversing with the Nautolan. A young Arkanian nurse approaches Tendau upon being spotted and asks, "**Can I help you?**"
----------------------------------------------------------
The quartermaster is found overlooking the storing of various equipment, the crates looking familiar as those being on the Herald transport now being scrapped in the Titan Valiant's hanger bay. The Zabrak watching the transfer, glances between his datapad and his two staff. "**No no, not there. That's reserved for machined parts. What does that crate say? Medical supplies, that's right. That one needs to go to the storage bay by the medbay.**" He turns when he notices others gathering around him. "**Ya? What do you want?**" he asks, pulling on the jacket of his uniform to make it straight. "**Heh, you must be from the team Captain Prius told me to expect. Right, right.**" Pressing a few keys on his datapad he holds it out for you to look at. "**Here's the equipment set aside for your mission. Please be sure to read the fine print, before you agree to it. Just tell me what you want and I can have it sent to your ship for before you leave.**" [manifest](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AjHYulLjxAGXdFA1b19Bc250VEExUDJkd0lSS0EyelE&hl=en&single=true&gid=0&output=html "https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AjHYulLjxAGXdFA1b19Bc250VEExUDJkd0lSS0EyelE&hl=en&single=true&gid=0&output=html")

Walking with Ka'ra Garin was thinking that it was unfortunate they wouldn't be able to work together. Still even if it was for a short time was better than not seeing her at all. Agreeing with her suggestion to go to the Quartermaster he nodded. It was a good idea. ***The way this planet sounds the more we have the better off the mission will be.***
Her question about her sister was tickling the back of his mind. He decided it was the best time to tell her. Turning his head he looked at her. **"Ka'ra there's something I should tell you concerning your father."** He stopped lowering his voice so that only she would her. He raised an armored hand and placed it on her shoulder. A smile came to his face thought she couldn't see it. He was quiet for a moment before speaking as if it what he had to say was going to be hard to do.
**"Ni ganar jorhaa'ir bah gar buir par gar vod gaan"** He let what he said hang for just a second. **"Kaysh jorhaa'ir elek."** He removed his hand from her shoulder. **"Rejorhaa'ir kaysh bah olaror haa'taylir ni."** He nodded his head to her in affirmation that what she heard was correct. **"I didn't have a chance to talk with her before I left."**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arriving with the others at the Quartermasters Garin found that he was in a good mood despite keeping quiet during the walk there. His mood was tapered off a bit when he heard someone barking out orders. Looking to the source of the voice Galen spotted a Zabrak directing others about. Quick and to the point he had them looking at a datapad. On it was equipment that had been set aside for them if needed. Nodding from where he stood he waited for the others to go over it first. ***I shouldn't need much. Still looking it over will definitely not hurt.***

Yuri took the datapad from the Zabrak with a nod, and looked at the screen. He scanned quickly through the list of items offered, trying to get a better grip on what the Republic expected of this mission. He hoped he wasn´t developing a streak of paranoia, but he knew that sometimes what people said and what they thought didn´t really match up very well.
He noted that a set of heavy weaponry was up for grabs, which caused him to raise an eyebrow. But given the lack of replace ammo, personal armor, and other similar things, he decided that they probably weren´t expected to do much combat after all. The abundance of survival gear made him feel like they were going on a camping trip, but he figured it could be nice to spend some time out in the wilderness. He checked out a pair of Electrobinoculars and a Multitool, and handed the datapad on to his friends.
While waiting for them to do their thing, he turned to the Quartermaster.
**"Hey, I think we might be doing some intelligence gathering once we go planetside. You wouldn´t happen to have a few datacards lying around would you?"**
Putting a hand inside one of his belt pouches, he fished out one of his Flash Canisters and held it up.
**"Also, do you know what this is? I don´t expect you to find them in a regular military armory, but they are pretty handy in creating diversions and shouldn´t be too hard to get a hold of. I´m not saying I need them now, but I´m running low, so if you think you could produce some for me, I´d really appreciate it"**
((
To clarify: Electrobinoculars and a Multitool. If possible also some Datacards, they cost virtually nothing, and would probably be the kind of stuff you have lying around in big stock. If any Flash Canisters are available now, I´ll take them, but I mainly wanted to express my interest in trying to get my hands on some more later.

*Typical. Damned Republic cheapskates. No damned fighters listed. When are the going to listen? Good fighter is all you need in almost any given situation,* Tanith thinks as he looks over the datapad. He punches in his list before passing it off.
**"I don't know about you fellas, but I'll have my swoop for long range recon and I didn't use all my allowance. If any of you want some transport I'll put what's left of mine toward it,"** he tells the group before turning to the quartermaster. **"I punched it in, but I'm telling you anyway. I need: one field kit, one long range com, one tent, one multitool and one knife,"** he says before lowering his voice and continuing, **"Any special orders? Want me to look for anything in particular while I'm down there?"** he asks, remembering the usefulness of a happy quartermaster.

Drem was easily one of the first ones out of the meeting and quickly made his way to his quarters. Grabbing his jacket and gear, he pondered for a moment what he might need and would have to request. *Got the basics,* he thought, spacing out for a moment as he ran through a quick gear list. *Might need a few other things, now that I think about though.* Scratching his chin, he slid the jacket on and snapped the gear in place, taking his leave of his room and locking the door behind him.
Bursting into the quartermasters, the scout almost plowed into their new Mandalorian team member, but caught himself as he veered into a well stocked shelf. **"Soova Oova Dreelish!"** he barked as a few ammo clips toppled on to him. Rubbing his head and realizing he made a bit of a scene, Drem quickly picked up his mess and, with a nervous smile, quickly looked over the list. Noting the All-Temp Cloak, his eyes lit up and, just as he was about to ask of the quartermaster had said cloak in 'hunter green', he noted the frustrated expression that the Zabrak had been giving him and decided to keep his questions to himself.

Seeing the nurse approach him the ithorian strides up to meet her part way across the med bay. **Ah greetings sentient, I was instructed by the captain to inquire about any spare medical supplies you may have available. If required I can pay for some, although I must say I am a bit strapped for resources, I do have 500 credits I could offer for any supplies you could spare.** Looking back to Fiolla the young Jedi acknowledges her and motions he will be over to speak to her and Kin in a moment. Turning back to the nurse Tendau smiles a warm grin with both his mouths awaiting her response.

Ka'ra shakes off Garin's hand on her shoulder, "**Don't scare me like the, ner vod,**" she says, her tone between restrained mirth and annoyance. Her head cocks to the side as she gives him a final glance before stepping into the lift. "**Suppose something can be arranged.**"
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Making sure the datapad is passed around to everyone, he glances at it before it's passed to the next person making sure everything checks out. At Yuri's request the man thinks for a moment before letting the datapad go to Tanith. "**Sure there are some datacards around we can spare,**" he says and then looks at the flash canisters. "**Aye, have maybe ten of those on hand. Captain doesn't want any requisitioning of grenades and such, but she didn't say you couldn't buy them.**"
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The nurse frowns and then nods, "**Yes, of course. We can't spare much, but Fiolla returned a medical kit with a medpac. I suppose we could sell you five more to fill it up at 75 credits each.**"

Garin waited as the others went over the manifest thinking it prudent to wait. When Drem was finished he took the offered datapad and looked it over. The available equipment was pretty good. They even had a land speeder as an option. It was good that Ka'ra mentioned that he come down here. While he was prepared for most things this planet seemed like it wasn't going to be a blue milk run.
Checking off a few things he handed the datapad back to the Quartermaster. **"Here, thank you."** Garin looked at the others and nodded to Yuir. His voice came through the speakers on his helmet. **"Since I wont be able to take along my fighter I'll need to grab a few things from it. Not much mind you as I generally have everything here on my armor."**
As he walked with them he asked a question. **"I know we don't know each other but with Ka'ra picking you all to work with her tells me that you all have something to offer."**

**"Mando's got himself a point. While he gets his answers we can iron out crew positions. I'm the pilot, naturally.

I'd like him as co-pilot and fall back engineer but if he's the best we have with a computer I'll need him on the sensors,"** Tanith says, gesturing to the man in question.
**"Tendau is the typical Jedi and, once on board, is good mostly for moral support, eh?"** he says with a chuckle waving towards the medbay. **"How about the rest of you?

Listening to Tanith Garin looked at each person as he talked about them tucking away the information to be referenced later if needed. At the pilots question about his own skills and how Mandalorians were perceived in the war. Garin nodded to Tanith. **"I still am a terror on the ground, close combat specialty, as well as knowing my way around a blaster. As to being a big target in space, I'm a trained fighter pilot."** He paused for a moment. **"Ship board qualifications, I'm a good hand in engineering sensors not so much."**

Yuri nodded to the Zabrak and replaced the Flash Canister in his belt. He gave the other a smile and raised his shoulders quickly. It seemed he would have to talk to Ka'ra or Prius or whomever would be appropriate and remind them about the fact that bounty hunters were usually paid for their services.
**"Thanks for the offer pal, but I am a little out of cash at the moment. Guess I should remind the boss that I did take part in the operation we pulled a while back. I might be back though"**
He turned back to the rest of the group, and the conversation at hand. When the question came to him and what he brought to the table, he shook his head.
**"I´m a more ground-based kind of guy. I typically sneak into places where I shouldn´t be and causes all kinds of mischief. In cases when it´s needed, I´m also pretty good with a blade"**
He pushed aside his cloak a bit to reveal the knife at his side and emphasize his last statement. He supposed it didn´t seem very impressive, especially the Mandalorian would likely be skeptic, but he didn´t mind. Between the blade strapped to his lower back, and his Force powers and experience at the hands of Sith Assassins and his masters training, he suspected that he could show anyone of his companions around the dueling circle.

Upon hearing the nurse's ability to work with his financial restraints Tendau was estatic.

After acquiring The components and thanking the nurse Tendau proceeds over to Fiolla and Kin asking,  **How are you feeling Kin?**he inquires and looking back to Fiolla asks,  **And staying safe and on board hopefully young one?** He asks with a questioning look to both sentients.

Garin looked at Yuri as he talked about his training and his ability with a blade. Emphasizing his point Garin followed the mans movements as he pulled aside his cloak showing a small blade. Garin simply gave a single nod as he smiled behind his helmet. **"Good to know as even a small weapon, such as that, in the right hands can be deadly."** He kept pace with the others as they walked.
**"I'm sure that once we're in the think of it we'll truly see how we fit together as a unit."** He took a few more steps. **"I'm sure that we all have something that may…surprise the other. Then again that is generally the way of new additions to a group."**

**"I'm going to want you on the sensors Drem. Garin, copilot and fall back engineer. Yuri, shields and engineer. Tendau can do the moral support. On the upside, he's good at it. What about our sixth?

The quartermaster easily adds the last item to Tanith's list, but is distracted from answering the pilot's request for the ponchos as he turns at a loud crash to see his two aides drop a large crate on themselves. Filled with energy cells and power packs, the contents of the crate scatter across to what seems like nearly all corners of the storage bay. It would be almost humorous if it wasn't for the dark red blots forming on the quartermaster's face. The quartermaster opens into a tirade in his native tongue as the two aides quickly attempt to set things to rights.

---

With the nurse promising to have the materials sent to the hanger bay, she turns to get back to her earlier duties leaving Tendau to his own devices. Fiolla gives Tendau a small smile and a nod. "**Yes, Master Lanius thought it would be best if I remained behind to help guard the Harvester,**" she says in a low tone.
On the narrow medical bed, Kin fidgets, "**I've requested my turn at guarding it, but the doctors won't release me. Something about possible internal bleeding.**" He shakes his head at the nonsense of the thought.

---

Techs move about the hanger bay, some working to detach the fighter from the *Atin Oya'ka* with a series of cranes while a young girl with bright red hair which contrasts sharply with the pure white jumpsuit, watches both fascinated and excited.
The ramp to the Citadel-cruiser is surprisingly open, but at the top, an ever present guardian, is Tentia who watches the movement around the ship and of the girl with equal apt attention.
Moving closer, Sajin, the Nagai Jedi, and Ka'ra can be seen conversing with a tall blond haired man recognized as Lanius. He's changed out of the dark robes and is now sporting loose fitting trousers and a dark vest. His blaster pistol still hangs from his belt, prominent against the hilt of his lightsaber. An accord seems to be reached between the three and while Ka'ra moves to step up into the ship, Sajin and Lanius head toward you. Sajin doesn't stop as he moves past the group, continuing on his way to leave the bay with only a small nod to the others as he passes. Lanius, however, stops to greet the team, "**Ready to go then? That's good.**" Indicating the retreating form of the Nagian he adds, "**Sajin won't be going with you, he feels his duty lies here.**" He looks at the new member of the team, looking at the man in the faceplate.

Listening to the marching orders that Tanith stated, Drem piped up. **"No offense, Tanith, but I'd be better served in engineering… I'm much better with a hydrospanner than a sensor board. And, it's not that I don't have much experience with Mandies,"** he stated. **"It's more that the experiences I have had, have taught me to be a bit cautious around them."** He looked to the Mandaolrian and continued. **"No offense, Garin, but I'm more likely to trust someone who's face I can see then the cold stare of your visor. It's not paranoia, but practicality … especially in our line of work."**
Once his requisitions were in place, the scout had little more to talk about, heading off to the ship in preparation for the mission. Greeting Lanius with a nod, Drem wasted no time and made his way up the gangplank, passing the strill on his way to engineering. Taking a look around, he checked over the systems, making sure there wouldn't be any problems once they broke atmo.

Upon hearing Kin's disdain for letting the healing process take it's course Tendau piped up,  **My friend it would be best to listen to the medical staff on this one. I know you'll have your chance to risk your life again in service of the republic, make sure you don't jeopardize yourself before that.** The ithorian finishes with a wink and a grin and a gentle pat on the back for the nautalon. Turning back to Fiolla he goes on,**As for you young one, it is best we have some one to guard the harvester that we know we can trust. Well I must be going you two, Kin rest up I know we'll need your battle prowess soon, and Fiolla be safe and be mindful of any disturbances in the force young one.** Finishing what had to be said the Jedi quickly makes his way to his quarters, gathers the rest of his gear and makes his way to the  *Atin*. After acknowledging Lanius orders he gives him an ardent farewell and follows Drem aboard. Making his way to the medical bay he does a system diagnostic making sure the crew is well supplied and the ships bay is prepared to receive and facilitate the healing of any of the task force.

Yuri nodded towards Drem as he suggested an alternate crew setup.
**"He´s got a point, you know. He did a pretty good job last time, and he´s a lot better mechanic than me. To be honest, I think none of us want me to be in charge of the systems keeping our ship intact. I guess we could switch places, and I can man the sensor and comm systems. I hope we won´t have any problems, but if someone starts asking a lot of questions, I tend to have a way of getting people to listen"**
Walking with the rest of them to the hangar, Yuri greeted Lanius and Ka'ra. He halted a moment when he heard Sajin wouldn´t join them, and looked after the Nagai as he walked out of the hangar. The guy was rather weird, but Yuri could guess the reason for him staying behind. He walked aboard the ship and tried to familiarize himself with the unfamiliar systems at the sensor station.

Walking back to the hanger was interesting as the others tried to figure out who would be best placed where. There seemed to be some disagreement about who would be on the ships computer. Drem seemed to go on about wanting to see what was under his helmet. Despite what the scout had said about it not being paranoia but practicality almost made him laugh. He rather liked how the cold stare of his visor affected people. It gave him the appearance of a impartial killer. Which if the situation arose he could be. As the door of the lift opened to the hanger he addressed Drems concern once again. **"On the ship I'll take my helmet off. Still I'm surprised that that all you need to trust someone is to see their face. That is a pretty thin to basis to base trust on."** With the door open he stepped out towards the *Atin Oya'ka* and his own fighter that was not far away.
Walking up he spotted Ka'ra and the Nagai speaking with a tall human near the ships boarding ramp. With the conversation apparently finished Ka'ra boarded the *Atin* while the Nagai and the human walked towards them. With word that Sajin would be staying behind Garin began to wonder what it was about the mission. First Ka'ra then the Nagai were staying behind. Though Ka'ra had a good reason. Drem continuing on with Yuri close behind Garin stopped before the tall human. Looking him over it was easy to spot the lightsaber that hung in plain sight. What was more surprising than the lightsaber was that the greeting in Mando'a. A half smile appeared behind his helmet as he held out a hand. **"I would hope she would. Our families have been close for along time."** Taking his hand back he raised both up to his helmet and gave it a slight twist. with a faint click the helmet was now loose. Lifting it off his head and tucking it under his left arm all who wondered why he looked like could now see. A man in his mid twenties with naturally tanned skin, black hair and bright green eyes.
Again Garin looked at the man in front of him. **"I must admit you have surprised me with my own language. Though the weapon you carry surprises me a bit more."** Garin indicated the lightsaber that hing near the mans blaster. **"It's an odd paring to say the least."** Garin really only knew of others in the Del-Fin clan that carried a lightsaber. Though they were attuned to their weapon and knew how to use it while others outside of the clan carried them as trophies. Question was, what side did this man fall into.

The strill watches as the others pass, its tail flicking and mouth lolling open in an apparent greeting, but it doesn't move from the place its taken.
Drem finds the ship in tip top shape as he looks over the engines on the lower level. The computer indicates as much as he pull up the maintenance log, which has been diligently kept by it's owner, a Jiles and Eeth Bralor (most of those records being in a spluttering of Basic and what must be Mando'a), and then by Tanith Hogra in the last couple months.
The medbay on the *Atin Oya'ka* is just how Tendau left it, with everything organized and placed to his satisfaction. It seems someone had already taken the liberty of restocking the supplies used upon the return from the last mission. From his vantage in the medbay, Tendau can hear Ka'ra cursing from somewhere in the lounge. The reinforced bulkhead to the armory off of the lounge is open, a bright red light streams in from its confines, and beyond, you can see Yuri making his way to the cockpit through the lounge.
Yuri, making his way to the cockpit, hears the muttered curses of Ka'ra from a room off the lounge, the reinforced bulkhead to open, a bright red light streams in from its confines. The cockpit itself as he can see through the opened reinforced bulkhead is indeed the nerve center of the ship, with seats for the pilot, copilot and the system operator, there isn't much room for anyone else.

A grin spreads across the young man's face, particularly when Garin removes his helmet in the public scene of the hanger bay. He takes Garin's hand clasping it firmly by his forearm. "**Lanius**," he says, introducing himself. "**Ka'ra has been a remarkable teacher. She has taught me enough so I would not embarrass her I think when I came across her kin. Not that I wasn't eager to learn.**" He says the last with a small shrug as he releases his grip on the Mandalorian's arm. "**As for the lightsaber… I have been trained in its use, but in this time it is not always safe to be affiliated with it.**"

After finishing his organizing and preparations to the bay Tendau couldn't help but notice Ka'ra's raised voice emanating from the common area. Upon hearing her swear Tendau grabs his belongings and hustles into the room adjacent to the lounge.  **Is there something wrong or that I could help you with young one?** The Jedi inquires of the young mandolorian.

Listening to the man who introduced himself as Lanius, Garin smiled at the fact that Ka'ra had taken someone under her wing. **"It looks as if she has taught you our language well. And don't worry about embarrassing her as log as you put forth the effort her we will recognize it."**
He paused for a moment reflecting on what he had said about carrying a lightsaber and the ramifications of carrying one openly. It was a statement he had to agree with which is why the compartment was built into his right forearm for just such a purpose. He gave the man a small nod. **"The problem with a lightsaber is that it is so closely tied to the Jedi that when ever one is seen using it people always think Jedi. Even I'm prone to that thinking sometimes. Things are not always as they seem. It's a good thing to remember."**
He looked to his fighter and then back to Lanius. **"If Ka'ra isn't around, when we get back, I'd be happy to work on the language with you. I still need to grab my gear from my fighter and stow it aboard the *Atin* so I better get going. It was good to meet you Lanius."** Giving the man a nod he put his helmet back on as he made his way to his fighter. Quickly grabbing his bag he began the lock down process on the ship which would secure it while he was gone. Satisfied when it was finished he made his way over to the *Atin* and up her ramp. Passing Tentia he gave the animal a quick pat on the head. It had been a while since he had seen the strill. As always it was a faithful companion to Ka'ra. He stood there next to Tentia looking around before heading back to where the bunk area was.

*That's right then. Do as you please. Only the best pilot for several parsecs is giving the suggestions. No, no, it's okay, I'm sure all of you have much more experience with tricky flying than I do,* he thinks as he sighs and makes his way past the Jedi leaving the group and the Jedi introducing himself to the Mandalorian. He doesn't realize that he pulls his own helmet on as the new member removes his, thinking, *Complaining never did a damned bit of good did it Tanith? Now I understand why the CO's always ranted and raved about 'chain of command', and the fact I understand it makes me hate myself just a bit. CO's are arseholes. Time to go to work.*
He finishes his inner monologue as he climbs the ramp, giving Tentia a formal bow as it passes him. He makes for the cockpit, gearing up mentally for the task ahead.

Lanius nods, a smile in his eyes as he takes in the Mandalorian. "**Very much so.**" The smile moves from his eyes to his expression as he bows in farewell to Garin. "**I look forward to seeing again. Ret'urcye mhi,**" he says before continuing on his way, moving toward the dynamic freighter resting in the bay instead of the exit.
Garin is followed up the ramp by the young red-headed girl who had been watching the deck crew separate Ka'ra's fighter from the cruiser. Her short legs move quickly to catch up to the older mans longer stride. The girl, looking no more than 13 or 14 looks at the armored man with open curiosity in her sea-foam green eyes. She doesn't speak unless spoken to as she reaches the top of the ramp, Tentia's tail flicking anxiously as the girl reaches up to the panel, which comes up just within reach, to lock down the ramp.

---

The cursing stop as the Ithorian Healer pops his head into the red lite room off of the lounge finding that the reinforced bulkhead in the storage bay was open as well. Ka'ra's helmet has been cast onto one of the tables where a small assortment of weapons has been secured, along the walls are numerous places for other large weapons, but at the moment, the walls seem bare for but a few rifles. To the side, a crate marked with a strange looking skull with a red and brown background cast behind it.
"**My father's hidden a tracking device in here.. I just know it**," she mutters. pulling up whatever she could and using her fingers to search in crevices she couldn't see or otherwise get to. She curses again loudly as the glove of her gauntlet snags on something.
On his trek to the cockpit, Tanith would hear the commotion.

Walking up the ramp Garin could not help but notice a young red haired girl following him. It was the same one he saw earlier who was watching the personnel remove the fighter from the *Atin*. Looking at the girl he smiled behind his helmet as he shorter legs worked fast to keep up with him. In her eyes he could see her curiosity as she looked at him. Reaching the top he looked around, not seeing anyone but the girl who was reaching to the control panel to lock down the ship. ***Interesting?***
Turning to face the girl he looked down at her **"So tell me, you must be the one that Ka'ra is taking home?"** He asked in a friendly tone. Her red hair reminded him a lot of Ka'ra and the fact that Tentia let her aboard was meant that he was probably right in his assumption. **"My name is Garin. Ka'ra will probably tell you lots of things about me. Don't believe them all."** Dropping his bag he reached up to remove his helmet. With it off he looked back down at the young girl with a smile on his face.

First he worries she had attacked the hapless Jedi again, then sees her tearing the ship apart instead. **"Aye, Tendau, this time, mind her hands, eh?"** he quips as he steps more fully into the room. **"What are you doing lass?

Taking his time in engineering, Drem was impressed with the overall care of the engines. *Good to see that Tanith can back his bluster,* he thought as he hoisted his gear and made his way into the large living quarters on the same level. Looking over the empty bunks, the scout claimed one nearest to Engineering, thinking, *Might as well keep close to the engines … never know when I might need to be quick on my feet.* Tossing his gear on the bed, he began the meticulous task of placing his gear in the nearby locker, keeping his tools slung over the bed post. **"Never know when I'll need these in a pinch,"** he muttered.

The young girl beams up at Garin. "I'm Emily and Ka'ra hasn't said much about you yet... Only that you were a close friend to her brother." She frowns, but then is distracted from the thought as Tentia comes over and nudges the girl as if wanted to play. "**Ka'ra insists that she's taking me to Concord Dawn… I don't want to go,**" she admits. "**I'd much rather stay with her as we agreed.**" Emily bends down, roughing up the folds of the strill's fur as she gives the creature a good pet, scratching it under the chin as its moth lulls open.

Garin couldn't help but smile as Emily's face lights up and begins talking. He stood there listening to her talk about Ka'ra taking her home and how she wanted to stay. **"I understand how you feel Emily. I was once in a similar situation. All my friends and family were going off to someplace that seemed exciting but I wasn't old enough to go yet. I wasn't ready."**
Watching her pet Tentia with abandon Garin moved a bit closer as his armored hand ran over the strill's ears giving them a good scratch. **"We need to be careful when doing this other wise Tentia will come to expect this all the time."** He finished with a gentile pat to the creatures head. **"Don't worry about going to Concord Dawn Emily. It is a nice place. Ka'ra's family is there as well as mine. There will be plenty to do so you won't be bored."** He gave her a slight nod of his head as he bent down to grab his bag. **"Remember what I said about giving her attention."** He pointed at Tentia with his helmet as he winked at her. Turning he moved off towards the bunk area.
Thoughts of young kids ran through his mind and that caused him to think of Malena. He missed her and not really having the chance to see her much less the time to even talk with her made him miss her that much more. Hopefully Ka'ra would be bale to get her to come out here and meet him. This way he might just be able to ask her a question. Which is what both families have been waiting on now for several years now.

Ka'ra glances up after inspecting the torn glove of her gauntlet and waving away any concern Tendau may have, looking up at Tanith she repeats her earlier accusation. "**I think my father hid a tracking device I didn't find…**" Course she didn't mention it was the only way Garin would have been able to find her. Turning back to her search of the weapons bench she continues to run her fingers along crevices as her eyes scan the surfaces as well. There's a click as her hands run across a particular section and a small drawer pops out. Gingerly she opens it, pulling out a small pouch she glances in but quickly closes. She looks thoughtful as she stands, closing the compartment with one hand.

Emily doesn't look convinced as Garin walks away, leaving her in the company of the loyal strill. Walking into the lower bunk area, Garin comes across Drem as he unpacks his own gear.

Giving Garin a nod as he secured his tools, Drem smirked lopsidedly. **"It's good to see that it didn't require major surgery to see what you *really* look like. Look, I think we may have gotten off on the wrong leg before … it's nothing personal, but between the uneasiness of what's happened in the last few years combined with all the cloak and dagger mumbo-jumbo and musical chairs going on around here …"** The scout paused as he searched for the right words. **"Well, let's just say it isn't the easiest situation to adapt to."** Offering his hand to the Mandalorian, Drem stated, **"I appreciate you holding to your word …"**

**"I'll have a look at what we're broadcasting from the com system while I do the preflight, eh? Otherwise, grab a scanning crew or get us some equipment. I may be able to find it but the black ops stuff I never got into,"** Tanith replies as he leaves the room, curious about the bag she had found. *Well, if she wanted to answer questions on it she wouldn't have put it away with that look on her face. The compartment was interesting though, wonder how many hidy-holes are hidden on the old* Atin*, hmm…* he thinks as he makes his way to the cockpit. Once there he throws the switch on the com system and leaves it to boot while he runs through his preflight checklist.
**"Got the hang of 'em yet Yuri? If you tinker long enough it isn't hard to get the computer to realize you need the display in Basic and not Mandalorian. Let me finish this sweep on the com system, then I'm going to borrow your console there and run a ship-wide sweep. Seems we have ourselves a tracking device,"** he tells the other occupant of the cockpit as he works. He moves to the now booted com system and checks all signals emanating from the *Atin*, if he finds any he tries to isolate their sources and to triangulate their locations.

Yuri had taken a seat at the sensor consoles, and tried to get at least a basic grasp of how the systems worked. He knew he´d never become a computer wiz in a few minutes, though he figured if he could understand how to read the automated parts of the system, his Force abilities could help him by offering intuition and insight into what they showed him.
When Tanith came into sight, he laughed and shook his head.
**"I was actually going to ask Ka'ra to try and teach me that language, so that might not be necessary. Still, I think I´ve got some basic hang of how this thing works"**
He got up from his seat, and moved out of the way.

Distracted from her methodical search of the armory, Ka'ra stops to watch as the Jedi reaches out to the Force in his attempt to find any devices in the area to which he has no luck. Either the device is cunningly hidden or there isn't one in the immediate area. As Tandau opens his eyes again they are greeted by Ka'ra's dark blue gaze as she waits. Finally the young woman asks, "**Any luck?**"

Garin simply smiled as he took the Scouts offered hand. **"Agreed its nothing personal. To be honest I know nothing of the cloak and dagger stuff that is going on here. Ka'ra asked if i wanted to help as she would not be joining you all on this mission, besides I can use a few credits."** Letting go of Drems hand he half threw his bag on the bunk that he claimed. **"As for the past and the war there is nothing to be uneasy about. If we had met on the battlefield during those times one of us would be dead."** His armored shoulders shrugged at the simplicity of the statement. **"Nothing personal, war is war. In situations such as that its best not to let it get personal."**
His last words made him think a bit. Was that really true or was he just trying to persuade himself of that fact. When Ka'ra's brother died in that last battle they were in he did take it personally. Much to the shock of the handful of republic troopers he came across after the fact. For that one time only he lost control and killed indiscriminately with wild abandon like Jalek did so often in combat. It made him wild and reckless which was something he couldn't afford.
He let out a small sigh practicing a relaxing technique. **"Regardless the past is the past."** He jerked a thumb to where the others were. **"Might as well go and see what the others are up to."** With that said he turned only to wait for a moment to see if Drem was going to follow and then began walking.

The enhanced sensors set about their work scanning the interior of the ship, the process slow as it dissects the ship, bit by bit, the results displayed on the screen as the computer processes it. After several long minutes the scan finishes. Nothing out of the ordinary shows up the scan and aside from a few conduits jury-rigged around shields there's nothing that shouldn't be there according to the design specs.

Deciding not to stick around, Ka'ra grabs her helmet and makes to leave the armory, the small bag now tucked into some webbing attached to her armor. She stops to look at the crate beside the door and with some difficulty due to her still mending shoulder, lugs it out of the armory. "**Please close up when you're done in here, Tendau.**"
Bypassing the cockpit, she leaves Tanith and Yuri to their work. Dropping the crate on the cargo lift, she sends it down before heading to the central hallway where she catches sight of Garin and then Drem as they climb up from the level below. "**Drem… Good, the others could probably use your help. They're trying to track down a tracking device.**"

**"A Tracking Device?"** Drem questioned. **"Who the nass would put a tracking device on the ship?"** He thought for a moment, pondering why and where someone put such a device. Not waiting around, the scout jogged into the cockpit and blurted out, **"Has anyone tried to look for feedback within the sensor or comm feed? If we take a look at the chatter, we may find something that doesn't belong in the sub-frequencies. After all, if it's operational, it should be transmitting and chances are, *something* on this ship should receive it, but it not appear as something obvious.

Within the first few minutes Tanith spots an echo, but leaves it. *Wait and let the scan finish, eh? Just an echo anyway,* he thinks. Almost as he finishes the thought Drem comes in burbling and babbling about something overly technical.
**"Deep scan is almost done Drem, hold on to ya hat, eh? Comm systems shows nothing,"** he tells the technician-scout. The scan finishes, the only thing shown is the aforementioned echo. *That must be it there. Now, to find it…* he thinks as his hands start to fly across the keys.
**"We've a reverberation in the readings, here,"** he points it out on the first screen. **"The computer obviously can't find it so I'm at a bit of a loss. Ideas Drem? *Garin*?"** he asks of the newcomers, eying the Mandalorian.
*Ship was built by a Mando, is flown by a runaway, and now he's hear. Either that's why or he at least knows how Mando's think when it comes to this black ops stuff,* Tanith reasons.

After a more careful search of the area Tendau is certain the device is not located in the storage or armory areas. Deciding that wandering around the ship searching may not be the best use of his time, the Jedi heads up to the cockpit to inform the others of his lack of discovery so the search may be truncated. As he enters and sees his companions busily working away with the ships computers the ithorian states,  **I thoroughly searched the armory and the storage areas off the lounge, I was unable to locate anything that drew my attention after scouring them for some time.

Coming up from the level below he catches sight of Ka'ra. He could feel some lingering feelings of frustration coming from her. When she mentioned the tracking device he smiled and nodded as Drem was quick to jog ahead to lend a hand. Looking at Ka'ra he raised an eyebrow. **"I'll give them a hand finding it. Knowing your father it will be difficult to trace."** Giving her a nod he walked after Drem towards the cockpit.
Arriving just as Drem was finishing but hearing most of what he said due to his voice traveling back to him Tanith started talking as to what he was doing. The pilot was running a deep scan of the ship. Knowing Jiles and how crafty the man was he doubted that it would work well. He silently cursed to himself wishing that he would have asked where and how the device was installed. Fortunately he did have some useful information.
Looking at Tanith as he heard his name he gave the cocky pilot a smile as he leaned up against the bulkhead. **"I don't know where it is. I didn't ask and Ka'ra's father wasn't forthcoming with the information."** He said pausing for a few seconds. **"I do know the frequency that its transmitting on. Unless one knows that they would never come across it. That may help you zero in on it."**

Yuri just hung around while Tanith did his thing, whatever he was doing with the sensors. He tried to think of places where anyone could hide a tracking device, but he did hope that a scan sweep would find the thing, because the alternative seemed to make a complete search manually, which was something he didn´t looked forward to. When the other came in, he listened to what they had to say. When Garin said he knew the frequency it was transmitting on, he figured that could help. As the discussion laid down, he looked at the rest of the group.
**"Does your scan cover the ships exterior Tanith? I´m no expert, but it seems like a good place to put something you don´t want to be found, and as long as you shield it properly, I would think it can transmit clearer than if placed inside the ship"**

Have it pinpointed in a jiffy,"** Tanith replies as he enters the frequency and quickly narrows down the area where it could be located. He pulls up a schematic of the ship, and highlights the rough area where the frequency is emanating from. **"Not a bad idea Yuri, but I'm guessing this one isn't something foreign, and its using our power supply.

Holding out his hands in a "oh, well" gesture, he retakes his seat in front of the sensor panel. Leaning back in his chair, he puts his hands behind his head, his feet up on the board, and closes his eyes and tries to center himself.

Tanith moves the panel to the side as he settles down to take a look at the sensor relays.

Not knowing what he's looking for exactly, he begins to take out the parts piece by piece, revealing parts as one would peel an onion.
Finally, the duo pulls out an essential part, which extended the range and processing power of the sensors, they are finally able to spot the expertly built in hardware. Built to provide the usual features to the array computer it allowed for a specialized signal to be transmitted via a hyperspace transmitter. The designer had taken great pains in insuring this tracking device wasn't found and if it was, would debilitate anyone who sought to remove it entirely.
As the two work, Emily comes over to watch, the strill nudging at her legs as she stops for awhile. Her curiosity abundant, she barely controls her urge to ask what's happening as she fidgets.

**"There's the bastard right there,"** Tanith says as he sits up out of the access hatch and turns where he sits to show Garin. He notices Emily and says, **"'Lo there, wee lass, are you curious or just need the refresher, eh? Heh! This here is one damned fine piece of work, and I don't know if I can disable it Garin. I do know we're bloody well blind without it."** He turns the part this way and that, trying to get an idea of how it could be done. *Given time, I may be able to write a program to control it, but the hardware itself? Jeesh,* he thinks as he looks it over.
**"Were it a normal part with an add-on it wouldn't be a problem, but I was an engineer and scout in the Mando War, and a pilot in the Jedi Civil War. Never was in intelligence,"** he says, feeling a little out of sorts.

After listening to the others, Drem headed back to the bunk to snatched the tools he'd left there and made his way to Tanith and Garin. *Didn't think I'd need these quite this soon,* he thought, running a quick check over the tools. *What was it that Uncle Gym used to say about detection devices? 'Best way to deal with them is the same way someone would deal with explosives: slow and carefully.' Mind you, that was after someone on his crew attempted to deactivate a tracking device and it wiped the navcomputer …"* Chuckling for only a moment, the gravity of that thought quickly hit home and his casual walk back turned into sprinted pace.
Once around the pilot and Mandolorian, the scout asked, **"What're we looking at? Is it webbed in there or is it something more hardwired? Think it could compromise the other systems if it's removed? You know, theoretically, if we re-modulate the device and make it dormant, it may actually make it easier to remove. If that's hardwired into any systems, we could wipe the computer, or worse, seize the system control drive .."**

He pulls out a chair at the common table and places the part in the middle for all to see before taking a punch from his toolkit to use as a pointer.

Garin sat down at the common table with Tanith and the others after helping the pilot remove the transmitter. Like he had thought it was integrated into a necessary piece of the sensors. With elbows on the table and fingers intertwined he listened to him talk about what they had found.
**"Like I said leave it in there intact. Jiles has been building starships ever since I can remember. He's one of the best. If we can simply turn it off and leave it dormant that might be ideal. This way maybe we can use it to serve our own purpose."**  He looked around at the others before continuing. **"If we get into trouble we can reactivate it and use it as a distress signal."**

And as far as I know, he don´t have any reason to want us harm, nor compromise our mission. And if the thing is as well-built as you say, we might need more time to do something with it anyway. So I agree with Garin: If we can, just turn the thing off, otherwise leave it be"**
The Jedi Bounty Hunter hadn´t opened his eyes while he spoke, but he could still feel those around him in the Force, feeling the tiny ripples in their emotions as he touched them one by one. He removed the other hand from behind his head and sat up straight, opening his eyes.

Coming out of her quarters with a bag hefted over her good shoulder, Ka'ra approaches the table and picks up the device, turning it in her hands thoughtfully. "**Looks like the old man hasn't lost his touch**," she mutters, setting it down again with a light thunk. "**My buir wouldn't have created a device which his enemies could have used to track him so I don't think we need to worry about it for now. At least we know now where it is and can deal with it.**" Adjusting the strap of her bag on her shoulder, she takes a moment to glance at everyone.

After listening to the more technically savy crew mates discuss and decide what to do with the discovered tracking device the ithorian opens his eyes and nods in agreement with Drem's statement about mission details.  **I agree with Drem, I believe a review of the details, an outline and finalization of our plans and logisictal details are the main particulars we need to lock down.** Pausing for a deep breath the Jedi seems to relax a bit as he continues with his train of thinking.  **For onething, we should trade and program in our operating com channels and personal frequencies so as to facilitate ease of communication.**  Tendau states as he divulges his earpiece comlinks frequency to the assembled team.

Looking at the Ithorian Jedi, Yuri restrained himself from frowning. Tendau reminded him of how the Council had acted when the Mandalorians arrived. There was a time to plan and think, and then there was the time to act, and he considered this to be the latter. And truth to be told, he was growing a bit restless. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he could hear the steady "Patience, my apprentice" sound, as it had so many times during his time in the Jedi Temple.
**"Fine, but I would like to make a request. Could we please take this *after* we have departed? No offense, but you can plan all you want and anything more complex than "We´ll head to the local cantina to ask around" is still very likely fail when we get to our destination. Not to mention that I do believe time is a factor in our mission"**
Preparing to take on some arguments and accusations of being reckless and careless, he willingly offered up his comm code to the others along with Tendau. Communication would be important, of course.

Ka'ra, with a shake of her head as some dissent forms between those gathered around the table. "**The supplies you requested have already been loaded into the cargo hold, I wish you all well,**" she says in farewell, turning to leave. Emily standing by the door, looks on at the others forlornly and then reluctantly gives them a wave goodbye and follows behind Ka'ra when she's beckoned. Through the cockpit window, anyone present can see Ka'ra loading the crate from the armory into the small hold of the fighter as well as her own gear with Emily's
With Tanith having already started some of the pre-flight procedures, the engines warm up quickly and the Titan's Valiant gives them the go ahead. It's not long after that the Atin Oya'ka is cruising away from the Hamerhead capital ship to a safe distance to jump.

Garin sat there listening to them as they started to bicker among themselves while trading comm codes. Taking their codes and supplying his in return. Turning his head as Ka'ra walked up to them he gave her a nod as she said her farewells. As she was leaving he promptly stood up. **"You all bicker like an old married couple. When you figure out what you want to do or who needs to be shot, let me know."** He turned to leave but stopped short. **"Remember though, even the best laid battle plans never survive first contact with the enemy. I'll be on my bunk. After being in that fighter for hours on end even a cot will seem like a four poster bed."** With several strides he left the others behind.
Walking out he headed to the bunk area. He arrived at the gang plank just as it started to rise up Ka'ra and Emily were already out of sight. He wished that he could have spent more time with Ka'ra but it was good that she was going back to Concord Dawn. Jiles would be happy to see her despite not returning with the borrowed ship. Turning into the bunk area he went to the bed he had claimed earlier. Taking out some comfortable clothing from his bag he set the garments aside as he began to take off his armor. Sleeping in it had never been a problem but he had been in it for days looking for Ka'ra.
With the armor off and some more comfortable clothing on he grabbed a blanket from the rooms closet and proceeded to make himself comfortable. Both gauntlets were close by. One held the integrated blaster and the other his lightsaber. Settling down he made himself comfortable for a light sleep and some much needed rest.

Yuri was taken off guard by Garin´s comment, and was only partially able to hold back a laugh. Talk about shooting and missing. As the Mandalorian started to head out of the lounge, he got out of his chair.
**"I´ll remember that Mandalorians consider two people who exchanges more than one sentence with each other to be 'bickering'. And thank you for repeating what I just said. If anyone need me, I´ll be downstairs"**
With a smile and a pat on an armored shoulder, Yuri slipped past the Mandalorian and headed for the ladder at the aft section of the ship. Dropping down without even using it, he walked out into the open space surrounding the ramp. Slipping the small survival knife into his hand, he flipped it around a few times, weighing it in his hand. Then he began to enter a series of regulated and well-drilled routines, twisting and flipping his body and slashing and stabbing repeatedly.
After a while, his movements became less stiff and regulated, and he flowed more naturally through each routine as he let the Force flow through him and direct him. He thought about drawing his lightsaber, and fully embrace the Force, but he decided against it. He didn´t want to draw it in here, and he would save it for a time when he needed it.

Drem rolled his eyes at the Mandalorian's comment and turned his attention to Tendau, nodding in agreement. Accessing the ships' computers, he pulled up the information on the mission, studying the planet in question, as well as any parameters that the mission called for. Shaking his head, the scout chuckled a bit and said, **"You'd think people would want to have some idea on where we were going and what to expect, you know? I've gone on some blind jobs in the past and, on a few of them, well let's just say I'm lucky I walked out of them."**
Making sure he took his time with the file, Drem made sure that Tendau (and anyone else wandering by) had time to review the material as well. **"So, what's your take on this?"** He asked the Ithorian, waiting to give his thoughts until he'd had a chance to hear his crewmate through.

The trip, composing of nine long hours, is uneventful for most as the crew spends their time in their own pursuits. The shift into realspace is smooth as the Atin Oya'ka's well tuned engines brings the ship out of hyperspace near one of the inner gas giants of the Luire system. With the thrusters at max power, the flight toward Nyriaan would be short. That would of course be the case if midway there the proximity alarms didn't start going off.
The sensors show a small space battle occurring on the other side of the nearest gas giant between a Dynamic-class freighter (designation currently unknown) and a couple short range fighters. The freighter has taken a significant beating, but as the ship's weapons lash out, disabling one of the fighters, it's obvious it still has some fight left to it.

Tanith's hands fly across his control board, sending power to the shields, weapons, and ship's intercom, **"All hands, we're missing the party!"** he barks before shutting the intercom back off. He focuses a sensor scan on the conflict, hoping to glean more details while his other hand slaps at the com station. *Worst damned crew. Gonna buy me a droid or two, even if they're just pit droids, to stand around and handle some of this trained monkey stuff since my trained monkeys are too busy,* he thinks as he struggles with the myriad controls.

Having returned from his training drills in good time to take his appointed place at the sensor/communications board, Yuri cast a skeptical look at Tanith.
**"Wait a minute, am I getting this right? We drop out of hyperspace, flies into a skirmish that we knows nothing at all about, and that isn´t really any of our business, and you just want to jump in, guns blazing? How will you even know what to fire on?"**
Shaking his head and wondering if the man was some sort of adrenaline junkie - after all, a lot of fighter pilots were - Yuri tried to use what little he had been able to get about the sensors to try and get a better reading on the ships involed. The larger ship he recognized as a Dynamic-class freighter, a rather common sight, but the smaller ships were unknown to him.

Yuri really wished that the Ithorian could read his thoughts at that moment. The guy must have been locked in the Temple all his life, since he was seemingly rather oblivious to irony or even jokes for that matter. He would probably have fit in perfectly during the golden days of the Jedi though, working as a diplomat or advisor at some royal court.
He waved his hand towards Drem. True, there was only one station, but the scout would likely be able to at least point to the right controls Yuri should use.

Inside the *Belaryot*, the pirate Xand Night sneezes.
'Kark it all!' the Nagaian berates his droid co-pilot in his native tongue as though everything, including the sneeze, are somehow the robot's fault, 'you call that shooting? Let's switch, you bucket of rust.'
'Sir-' the droid began, but Xand is no longer listening. He is instead focusing on the fight.
'I suppose I'll have to make every shot count now your corroded processor is responsible for our manoeuvres, he mutters to himself as he waits for the right moment.
Then he fires, and in the moment he realises he's timed it right. The bolt manages to take out one of the harrying fighters, the vehicle drifting listlessly away from the skirmish, apparently disabled.
'Sir!'
'And *that's* how it's done, you see?' he crows in triumph, before he finally realises what the droid is trying to tell him, 'another ship!? But who's!?'
Stealing a quick glance at the readouts Xand begrudgingly acknowledges that it doesn't matter, he has to take the risk.
He hammers at the comm controls, opening up a wide brand broadcast.
'Incoming vessel,' he explains as quickly as he can for the crew of *Atin Oya'ka* to hear, 'I am Elan Aphotic, captain of the *Belaryot*. If you are enemies of oppression and evil, please assist!'

At the call from Tanith Garin made his way forward to the cockpit area to see what exactly was going on. What he found out as he saw the *Atin Oya'ka* begin a wide berth around the fight ahead of them was the others. He sighed as he shook his head. He was about to tell them about what he had read on the data packet but the actions and irritations he felt in the force from the others side tracked him.
**"I'm finding it hard to believe that Ka'ra spoke so well of you all.

If they're in trouble, we might need your help."** Finishing his statement, he tried his luck with the sensor board, letting his fingers guide calmly across the board in hopes of determining some information.

**"*If you are enemies of oppression and evil, please assist*? This one thinks we were born last night, collectively, mind,"** he says over his shoulder, then pauses to listen to the others for second. He then mutters under his breath, **"Bloody well might have been now that I think about it."**
*To hells with the committee, I'm going to regret this in the long run because the freighter is trouble, but I see no reason not to have a bit of fun. S-100 Stingers, eh?* Tanith thinks as he pours on the engines and loops into the fray, not caring if the crowd in the cockpit is strapped in. He blazes past the remaining fighter, flashing it with his jets, a classic 'come play if you dare' amongst fighter pilots. That he's in a oversized ship isn't lost on him, its a testament to his confidence. Regardless of the enemy pilot's decision, he twirls the port side cannon and lets loose a blast...

**"They´re S-100´s all right. Whoever´s in them is likely a decent pilot, those things were used by Jedi during the war. But like you said Drem, they´ve drifted into the use of pirates and mercenaries these days"**
As he listened to the message coming in from the freighter, he thought to himself that whoever sent it either thought them really gullible, or had a too high opinion of themselves. But on the other hand, the S-100 fighters were used mainly by fringe elements today, so it seemed likely that they weren´t exactly good guys either.
When he felt the ship accelerating, and weapons firing, he called over to Tanith again, this time making sure the joke in his voice was being heard, seeing as everyone seemed to be too tense to hear it otherwise.

Noticing the ship angle for an attack trajectory towards the unknown fighters, the ithorian shakes his head with a slightly bemused grin on his lips.  **On second thought Yuri, it may not be a gundark's nest, but it may be a rancor's den. Now would be a time for the hot hand at the helm Tanith.**  Noticing the look of concentration on the human pilots face the Jedi takes a step back giving them more room in the cockpit to move so as to better manuever the ship.
 **Is there anything I can do other than spectate on the three of you? If not I have a medpac ready if any one takes injury while engaging the unknown fighters. And by the way has any one tried hailing the fighters before we blast them into space dust? I'd really hate to get on the local security forces bad side before we even start any real mischief.**

Drem slid away from the sensor board and looked to Garin. **"You know this ship better than I do … are there any other guns besides the ones that Tanith is blasting with? Maybe some of us would be better served in those, especially if we're about to enter combat."** It was fairly apparent that he didn't know much about the ship beyond a quick understanding of the engineering section. Making sure to gather his tools, the scout then said, **"Otherwise, maybe we should both be in engineering to make sure this ship doesn't fall apart, huh?"**

At Drem's question he replies, **"Are there weapons?! It's a Mandalorian ship! Of course there are: lower level, each corner, you'll find a gun blister. Two heavy turbo-lasers, two ion.

Looking at the console for the aforementioned jammers, Yuri shakes his head.
**"I don´t think this ride has any jamming systems, or if she does they´re located somewhere else. I can maybe try to tap the transmission for you, and let you know if any additional fighters are coming in to shoot at us"**
Yuri wasn´t at all sure that it would yield any success, as it had appeared that the fighter was sending some kind of encrypted signal, but he decided to give it a try. After all, he didn´t really have anything better to do here, did he? He wondered if perhaps it would be for the best if he just left the sensors to Drem, and instead took control of one of the gun turrets.

Lights flash and sirens blare as the *Belaryot* takes a solid hit. The freighter's owner doesn't need to see the up to date readouts to know that it won't survive another.
'Ahh, frag it!' He bellows, 'what are they trying to do, kill me!?'

'We might survive this yet,' the Nagaian chuckles, 'Boltbucket, try and get that vessel in between us and the fighters!'

Coming back around the fighter continues to use it's speed to keep the upper hand, preventing its target from moving out of its range. With almost perfect aim, the fighter makes a direct hit to the Dynamic-class freighters thrusters, the majority of the blast making it's way through the dwindling shields of the freighter. The pirate prince finds himself with little time to escape as systems begin to overload around him. The only reason the ship itself hasn't exploded is due to the diligent work of the Nagai's droid companion. Ervin beeps and whirs as it works to keep the ship together long enough for Xand to get off.
The *Atin Oya'ka* comes about the tractor beam activating under Tanith's guidance, the beam itself locking in, but fails as a shot from the fighters rocks the ship, disrupting the beam long enough for it to escape. Taking control of one of the laser cannon turrets, Tendau inexpertly takes aim at the fighter as it begins to move away from the **Atin**. While the shields seem to dissipate a majority of the laser fire from the quad cannons, the blast still manages to bore a hole into the fighter's hull.

As the fighter takes a shot at the *Atin* Tanith finds himself raging almost incoherently, garbled sounds of outrage escaping him as he twists the control yoke.

The fighter draws back from the Atin, firing a last shot as it begins to head towards its compatriot. When the Atin draws closer the presumably disabled second fighter fires a proton torpedo at the unsuspecting Citadel-class freighter.
Tailing the fleeing fighter, Tanith lines up the Atin's tractor emitters, which once again come to life, grabbing hold of the fighter, the fighter's pilot, distracted, is unable to break free of the cruisers grip this time around.
On board the Belaryot, Xand manages to make it to the lifepod as the last of the systems begin to break apart. There's a whir and high pitched beep as his droid copilot makes a last ditch effort to make it to the lifepod in time.

Unable to break free of the tractor beam just yet, the trapped fighter fires it's proton torpedo at the cruiser holding it. Dodging barely out of the way, Tanith manages to avoid the worst of the torpedo blast as he sends a torpedo of his own, destroying the helpless fighter held in the tractor beam. The remaining fighter in retaliation of his comrade's demise, fires his laser cannons. While the majority of the damage is absorbed by the shields and hull plating, it's doubtful the *Atin Oya'ka* could take much more.
Garin gets to work on rerouting power to the shields, but with the damage the ship is taking all his work comes unraveled.
Xand's lifepod launches away from the debris that was his freighter, toward the black of space.

Conveniently enough sitting at the communications console, Yuri slammed down on the button cutting all extremal communication. He left it open to still receive though, in case the wounded fighter would respond. Obviously annoyed now, and not bothering to hide it, he turned towards Tanith.
**"Hey jackass, how about running this as a team instead of messing everything up? I just told you that guy was calling for backup, and unless that little guy packs some serious communications gear, I´d suppose whoever he´s calling isn´t very far away. And I trust that you are smart enough to understand how we´d fare if more fighters starts to show up and shoot at us. Blow him out of the sky if you think we have to, but I suggest we get out of here, and that fast"**
Saying what he had wanted to say, he turned back to the sensor board, trying to cram out as much range as possible from the ships sensors. He didn´t think the S-100 came equipped with hyperspace drives or communications, which would mean, just like he had said, that the enemy´s reinforcements would have to come from rather close by.

Gritting his teeth as he is completely fooled by a competent maneuver by the damaged fighter the ithorian holds true to his conviction the force would guide them. Looking at the ship from his turrent he hopes that they either make a break for it, or a more competent hand grabs a quad cannon.
Opening up the intercom Tendau says to the cockpit, **Tanith it may be time to cut and run, try to lock onto that life pod and get us out of here, if not let's get some more skilled gunners down here, the force can only go so far, it dosnt make up for a complete lack of training.**
Hoping the human takes his queue to leave the fight, the young Jedi prepares another unskilled salvo if they swoop into range of the damaged fighter.

With his comlink open to the cockpit Garin easily overheard the heated conversation between Tanith and Yuri. Things were clearly getting out of hand as he heard the torpedo leave the ship. Tanith was living up to his fighter jock image, cocky beyond belief. That all by itself seemed to almost be enough to get them all killed which was adding to his irritation with the man the comment about the cafe only added to it.
**"Wait a minute you mean there's some hot cafe ready to go. I guess the repairs that I have been doing to keep us alive can wait. I'll be back in a few."** The sarcasm and irritation in his voice was evident. **"Oh and let Drem and I know when you two are done measuring your manhood up there. I wouldn't want to interrupt and ruin your bonding time."** He cut his link but left it so that he could be contacted.
Looking at Drem he shook his head. **"This is just wonderful. If Kara had told me about those two I would have declined on this mission."** He looked back to the current repair he was working on. They had taken several good hits and there were at least several more that would require attention.

As the *Atin* draws out of range of the fighter's weapons, it sends a parting shot missing the *Atin* under Tanith's expert guidance. The fighter manages to send out a last transmission before the torpedo sent by Tanith destroys the immobile fighter. The inexperienced gunner, Tendau, believing he his making a dead on aim of the guns at the fighter, prepares to pull the trigger, but as he depresses the button, the power diverts from the turret.
Getting to work once more on the shields, Garin is able to reroute more power. Any extensive repairs will require more time.

Shaking his head in a response to Garin, Drem hoisted the tools and begin working on the nearest vital repair. **"We need to land someplace safe,"** he stated, taking a look at the primary power coils. **"If we keep getting hammered like this, we'll be space dust or worse."** Frowning on what he saw, the scout took out a hydrospanner and began to remove the outer cover for the converter couplings so he could take a closer look at their condition. **"At this rate, I'd be amazed if we could actually take on re-entry, let alone taking on more passengers.

He quickly goes back to work, setting the tractor beam on the escape pod to pull it in while making a b-line for atmosphere.
**"Lets set our differences aside, lad, at least temporarily. We've no idea what or who is in that pod, and since close quarters is one of your specialties would you mind helping Tendau see to our new ward?

**"I would sincerely hope that I don´t have to kill whatever is in that pod after all the trouble we went through to pick it up"**
Getting up from his chair, Yuri checked that his knife sheath was sitting alright on his belt, and before heading out, he turned back to Tanith.
**"Look, I´m not trying to create any tension in the group, I just wish you´d treat the rest of us as a team, instead of just a crew that should follow your orders. Though I have to say if you´re going to keep running us into trouble, at least it seems like you have a knack for getting out alive"**
Drawing a deep breath in through the nose and exhaling through the mouth, an old technique for calming yourself down, he pointed toward the communications console.
**"By the way, that fighter sent a final transmission right before you vaporized it. It pretty much said we´d be okay if we backed off, but that we´d be in serious trouble if we kept interfering. I´m not really sure what we should make of it, but since you shot it down, I´d say to make double time to finding a good place to lay low"**
Finishing the sentence with a damp smile, he left the cockpit and headed down to see what they had dragged aboard.

Xand grins toothily to himself as the last fighter is destroyed, mentally applauding whoever made the shot.
He is vaguely aware, even as he directs his escape pod to dock with the battered *Atin*, that his deliverance might be anything but. Still, he is alive right now when he might otherwise be dead and that at least is something to be grateful for.
'Show me what you've got,' he murmurs as the pod locks into place, his fingers finding comfort on the grip of his pistol.

 **Let us show some caution here, even if we may have failed to do so earlier this afternoon,**  the Jedi says with a chuckle as he unclips his lightsaber and swings his medical supplies to his back.
With a grin for Yuri, Tendau says,  **Now let's see what is behind door number one..** Posturing himself defensively he waits for the pod to unseal.

With the help of the tractor beam, the wayward life pod is quickly moved into position. After a few moments of the Atin securing the seal, the hatch opens revealing the small compartment of the life pod.
It takes about five minutes for the Atin to reach the planet Nyriaan. As the citadel-class ship approaches, a signal from the orbiting platform opens, the automated message directing the pilot not to attempt landing. Requesting the Atin's credentials, Tanith is directed to dock at the designated port upon sending the information.

From within the life pod steps a pale man dressed in black leathers, his white skin dirtied, his otherwise fluffy hair matted by blood, and his jacket scuffed. He holds a large two-barrelled blaster pistol in his left hand, though slightly lowered.
The young man's eyes flicker between the two members of the welcome committee and when he sees the ignited green lightsaber, he laughs.
'The Force has smiled on me, Jeedai,' he says with a weak grin as he returns the pistol to its holster, 'thanks for the rescue. I'm Elan.'

Yuri takes a step aside, letting the Nagai get out of the pod, watching him closely, searching for any hidden weapons. Most out of curiosity though, he didn´t expect the fellow to try anything funny. He waved a hand towards Tendau, both to try and signal to the Ithorian to stand down, but also to indicate his ally.

'Bumps and scratches,' the Nagai replies, 'nothing serious. I just got shook around a bit, that's all. I'm probably more in need of a shower than a medical examination.'
Yuri would note, along with the pistol holstered across the young Nagai's shoulder, a sheathed vibroknife at his hip and a bandolier crossing his chest that could hold all manner of potentially dangerous or perfectly innocent things. Behind him in the escape pod is a spacer's chest which Elan kept there at all times in case of just this eventuality.
Any hidden weapon, if he has one, would be quite effectively obscured by the bulk of his leathers and the other items he carries.
'I think they were pirates after my cargo,' Elan tells him, 'though they changed their mind about what they wanted from me after I started fighting back.'

Garin held on to the bulkhead with one hand as he stretched to reach the loose power coupling with the other that was currently holding a hydrospanner. **"I cant wait to see what the outside looks like. With the beating we took I'm almost surprised that we're holding together."** The Mandalorian said to no one in particular even though Drem was not far away.
Upon hearing the life pod dock with the *Atin* gave one last turn with the spanner and the coupling was no longer a problem. **"Sounds like we picked up a new passenger. I hope it was worth the beating we took. One look at the Atin and Kara won't be to happy."** Satisfied with his area he stepped back and looked around. Not seeing anything else that was in need if immediate tending to he nodded at Drem.
**"I'm going to head up and see just what Tanith risked our lives for."** Turning around he moved quickly towards the air lock. Dialing up his audio receptors he heard no sounds of fighting or raised voices. Taking a breath he slowed his pace slightly as it seemed that the new passenger was at lease cooperating, for now. A moment later he arrived to see Yuri and the Jedi talking to he new arrival. He began listening to the the conversation.

The beacon directs Tanith to a dock, the clamps locking on and the airlock engaging. Over the communications system, Tanith is given a visitor directory to peruse. There's only one source for the Laser Tranport arrays and they are controlled by the Navigator's Guild. As for services, for a small port there's a great deal of mechanical services to be offered.

A loud clanging sound came from the back ducts followed by a loud **"Jesska Dapa Poodo!"** Reaching out to grab his spanner, Drem wrenched the tool in place and and groaning could be heard throughout the engineering room. **"C'mon you peeza poodo! I'd bet a solid cred that it was a Jawa that manufactured these frakkin' pieces of monkey-rat dung parts!"** Hearing Garin, he waved the Mandalorian on with a quick wave of his hand and a thumbs up. **"Oooh no you don't!"** he exclaimed to a small screw which attempted to roll out of the duct, **"Get back here, you gundark-suckin'-narglatch!"**

Tanith begins by convincing the port computer to let him see what he's after, then he runs a query for data on the atmosphere and whether or not the Laser Transport Arrays are legally necessary and for more information on the arrays like price and requirements. He takes note of services offered, hoping they wouldn't need more than a few parts considering their lack of credits. *Well, my lack of credits. I doubt the rest of this lot has any either,* he thinks. He tries to get this bit done as quickly as possible so he can get back to engineering and take stock of the damage and start helping the repair process.

When the two were out of earshot Garin gave a small sigh. **"We took a good pounding. I think that if we had taken another good hit we wouldn't be here talking.

"**Basic, lass, or teach me the damned language, either one.**"
There's a pause and the sound of rustling cloth as she apparently moves from wherever she was when she recieved the transmission. "**You've caught me at a bad time, Mr. Hogra. What is it?**"
"**Well, we're here, the ship took some damage and the Nav Guild has a strangle hold on planetside transport, and to my knowledge, we're mostly broke. Have you found a buyer yet?**" He says with a sigh as he sits back, pulling off his helmet and rubbing st his temples.
"**How much damage?**" she asks cautiously.
"**Not sure yet, I've not had a look and I've had no word from engineering. She's still flight and fight-worthy. Some communications issues made it worse than it should have been, but those will be resolved shortly, eh?**"
"**Resolved soon I hope… Lanius is still in the process of selling off the rest of the cargo.**" There's a loud crash and then a heavy sigh from Ka'ra, followed by someone calling in the distance.

"**Better than what we have to work with now, so we'll take it gladly. They'll be resolved, I doubt to anyone's liking, but resolved either way.

'You're gracious to apologise, and unnecessarily so Captain Hoagra,' he asserts, though not without an obvious hint of regret, 'my poor *Belaryot* was doomed in any case. But your crew and yourself have prevented the doom of her owner, and for that I'm thankful.'
'The ships... I cannot truthfully say who they belong to. They didn't do me the courtesy of identifying themselves before they engaged.

Nodding at Tanith's request for what was to come aboard the space station the ithorian runs over a few questions on his mind then asks,  **I know you'll most likely all be busy with the repairs and all but I have a few questions before we get under way.**  Pausing just a moment he looks directly at the human pilot and reasons,  **Firstly we'll need the access code and account number with the credits to negotiate with the nav guild, secondly are we taking a nav guild provided transport? Or is there a part we can obtain or frequency etc. that you all can install once we effect the negotiations? Also will the Atin be recquiring us to obtain other parts aboard the station as well?**  After finishing the mouthful of questions the Jedi awaits a response from the assembled companions.

**"The account numbers and passwords are here,"** Tanith says as he passes over a datacard with the information, **"and the Navigation Guild has put a lock down on a piece of tech that makes navigating the atmosphere of this planet possible, it's called a Laser Transport Array. We have to lease one from them, then pay one of their mechanics to install it, then pay one of their flunkies to fly down with us so we don't mess it up. Unfortunately, there isn't any haggling to be done, just set prices. While you're out we'll be getting an idea of what we need, and will call you so you can pick it up on the way back. If my guestimates are correct, we can hire a couple hands and be in top condition in three hours, barring any complications. That should be plenty of time to get the LTA installed and us on our way,"** Tanith explains.

Ka'ra is as good as her word. The credits are transferred quickly to the account she set aside for Tanith and he finds the account balance more than adequate to hire a couple hands for repair work, the needed parts, docking fees, and for the equipment rental and installation of the laser array.
With the help of the hands, Tanith, Elan, Garin and Drem are able to get the ship in tip top shape in about three hours, the installation of the laser array scheduled for the latter half. The surly Duros technician, certified by the Guild for the installation of the device, gruffly arrives at the umbilical mooring the ship to the orbiting station. Not a very talkative sentient, he mutters about needing access to the sensors, before getting to work.
In short order everything is ready to depart. The technician leaves and all that's left is the arrival of the Navigator hired to ensure the ship's safe arrival through the storm enveloped atmosphere of Nyriaan.

Elan happily engages in any repair work he's trusted with, a smile on his face and a whistle never far from his lips. The Nagai works quickly and efficiently at his tasks, apparently every bit as comfortable around a hydrospanner as he intimated earlier. He cheerfully hails any passing crew member, though never looking up from his current task. All in all, he behaves as the very model of a grateful rescued party!
Once done with repairs he returns to the common area, fairly certain his presence won't be required or indeed wanted on the bridge when the navigator arrives. He takes the liberty of preparing a pot of strong cafstim. After pouring his own cup he returns to the same seat he had chosen earlier and settles down, gazing thoughtfully down into the steaming mug.

After discussing the finer points of what would be needed for the repairs and subsequent departure for the planet with Tanith, Tendau makes his way to the various part shops and technicians before finishing his station voyage at the navigation guild. After being told exactly what was needed for them to do and how much it would cost, with no negations allowed by a rather taciturn fellow at the guild he returned to the Atin to await the completion of the repairs. Not being very handy with mechanics or computer systems the ithorian offers his help where he can and meditates as often as possible bringing him self to an extremely peaceful mind set before their imminent departure for the planet. Although seemingly at odds with his other activities he seeks out pointers on the weapon systems of the ship after his dismal showing in their last engagement.
As the repairs draw to a close Tendau triple checks his medbay and wanders the corridors of th Atin as he makes his way back to the common room, grabbing a comfy seat off to the left of Elan, nodding to the pale humanoid as he enters the room in silent greeting.

With the newcomer aboard and things out of the way the four of them set about to making the ship fully operational again. When the Guild certified tech showed up for the installation of the laser array Garin stepped away to escort the Duros and showed the shorter alien where he needed to go. Guild certified or not he didn't know the tech and didn't trust him. Besides who would try and pull a fast one when a Mandalorian was watching over what you were doing. He made it a point to ask a few questions as the tech worked so he would have some understanding how the array integrated into the ships systems.
Garin walked back into the common area after showing the Duros off the ship. Seeing the pot of cafstim he walked over and poured a cup. **"Well the laser array is installed. so we should be good to continue on."** The Mandalorians voice came from the helmets speakers as he looked down at the steam rising up from the cups contents. Setting the cup down he reached up and removed his helmet and grabbed for the cup. Taking a sip he nodded. **"Good and strong. Just what I needed."**
Walking over to the couch he remained standing as he looked at the Jedi and Elan. **"Nice work on the repairs. With Tanith flying we'll need all the experienced repair hounds we can get out hands on."** He said with a half smile on his face.

Not really one to be experienced with hydrospanners and fusion cutters, Yuri found himself mostly running around the ship and giving a hand to those who needed it. As it turns out, it can be rather handy to be both acrobatic *and* Force sensitive when you need to wriggle yourself into a tight service hatch and use both hands to simply hold you in place. When he is not needed, he can usually be found looking over someones shoulder, cracking a clever (and somewhat annoying) comment to those who actually knows what they´re doing, most often Drem, Tanith or Garin. All in good fun though.
Once they´re finally done with the repairs and installations, he joins the rest of the people in the common area, dropping himself into the second couch.

Soon enough the bonded navigator arrives with little fanfare, a tense Snivvian who introduces himself as Tevlun. Although he is dressed in the uniform of a bonded navigator, the Snivvian acts somewhat wet behind the ears. After displaying his credentials to Tanith, the ship's designated pilot, and anyone else with interest enough to take a look, he explains he will need access to the cockpit to install the universal control station which will hook into the installed LTA sensor system. He drums his fingers nervously as he works, oblivious to the fact that anyone around him can sense his discomfort.
"**This shouldn't take more than a half hour,**" Tevlun pipes, dragging the last of the equipment into the cockpit from the cargo lift. "**We'll be set to go after that,**" he adds before ducking beneath the *Atin Oya'ka*'s sensor and pilot control panel to hook up his necessary connections for his specialized portable device.

I hope we don't go broke on this trip. Five thousand dwindled quickly to 2050.*
He makes it to the common area and pours himself a cup of caf, about to praise his annoying crew on their superb work when the Snivvian comes aboard. **"Yes yes, right this way,"** Tanith replies, joining the little being in the cockpit and watching him closely, sipping his caf.

Straightening up his posture, Yuri raised an eyebrow as it seemed Drem was somewhat familiar with their newly rescued friend. At least something good had come out of that experience. At the mention of visiting bars though, he scratched the back of his head.
**"Don´t interpret this an ungratefulness, but I think we have some more pressing business to do than drinking when we get planetside. Bars may be a good place to look for information, but I would suggest we keep the drinking until we´re done.

With time passing quickly on board the Atin, it's not even fifteen minutes before there's a loud yelp followed by a curse from the cockpit. Pulling himself out from beneath the control consoles, the tense Snivvian gives the observing pilot a thumbs up before a starts to suck on a burn he had given himself. "**The controls are set up. After a quick diagnostic we can get going.**" Not waiting for Tanith's permission, he takes the pilot's controls, starting up the engines and the ship's main systems. After a few minutes he proclaims, "**Everything is green on this end. If your crew is ready to set out, I'll get permission from Platform control.**" Only then does he look back, looking for Tanith's go ahead to set out. Getting what he wants, he makes a finally suggestion, "**To minimize the chance of injury during descent, I highly recommend everyone strap in.**"
It's not long till the Snivvian gets permission to leave the platform, Tevlun drumming nervously on the console as he waits for verification. Veering away, he sets his course towards the planet. The sickly clouds swirling around the planet below begin to darking as the *Atin Oya'ka* slowly approaches them. Tevlun, the navigator, sits at the pilot station. his stubby fingers picking nervously at keys and switches. as he monitors the ship's descent.
"**We are within fifty kilometers of breaching the ionosphere**," he reports. "**I will now be shutting down all unnecessary systems until we touch down.**" As if on cue, the interior lighting dims, and the omnipresent sound of the air scrubber is replaced by the faint thrumming of the sublight engines. The ships seems strangely quiet, and looking through the cockpit viewport you have the sudden impression that you are falling toward the planet- an impressions that is not entirely wrong.
"**Orbital laser telemetry acquired. Surface laser telemetry acquired,**" Tevlun continues, as if speaking to himself. "**Adjusting course to maintain synchronization. Entering atmosphere in 3..2..1.**" The view beyond the cockpit suddenly goes dark and the sublight engines begin to sputter. Tevlun flips a switch, compensating for the burst of intense ionization that the ship has suddenly been exposed to. The engine noise subsides somewhat.
Suddenly, a light on Tevlun's console blinks an angry red, and an accompanying alarm sounds shrilly in the confines of the cockpit."**Uh oh…**" Tevlun stammers in panic. "**I've lost surface telemetry!**"

This isn't hyperspace, cheezo …"** Slipping past their 'pilot', the scout slid under the control consoles, slipping a hydrospanner out from the toolbelt he'd been wearing. **"… it's not like we should have any problems with this sort of system unless there were some 'installation' problems …"** Sparks snapped under the the consoles as the scout hastily attempted to bypass the outer manifold and realign the inner sensory board so it could home in on the telemetry signal. **"Beesha!

It's clear by the control board that the sensors and the LTA system are operating optimally, at least that's what the self diagnostic indicates. The LTA is still receiving telemetry from the orbital array, however the surface telemetry seems to have been deactivated. Aside for the orbital array, the ship is now flying blind through the storm ridden atmosphere toward the surface.
The Snivvian begins to hyperventilate as the ship continues to fall through the planet's atmosphere. As Tanith takes the controls, Tevlun grabs hold of the pilot's arm. "**We… must… ascend…**" he says between gasping breaths. The engines whine as the magnetic fields of the storm interferes with the sublight engines, causing the ship to jolt and nearly throw anyone not bracing themselves appropriately. Tanith is however successful in slowing the descent of the ship.
As Drem gets to work, he discovers the wires were for the finer controls of the piloting station. Reconnecting them with the assistance of Garin and Elan, the engines get a sudden surge of power, stabilizing the ship as it hits the storm. Drem realizes too there isn't much he can jury-rig after this without blowing out the engines or what's left of the sensor array.

As he made his way towards the hangar, Yuri hung back a bit not to make the crowd in there even bigger. As he heard the Snivvian tech start to hyperventilate, he squeezed his way into the cockpit, and gently grabbed hold of the small creature and pushed him back towards the exit of the cockpit.
**"Tendau, try to talk some sense into this guy, and see if he can pull it together and help us instead of breaking down"**
He hoped the Ithorian could get the terrified tech to calm down, and it would probably help to get him out of the cockpit, what with all the turmoil and people being angry with him in there. As the ship jolted harshly when Tanith pulled the controls, Yuri nearly lost his footing as he stumbled up behind the pilots seat. Apparently here the danger came without no warning. Suddenly something sounded in the back of his head, and a sudden urge of danger, combined with the warrior instincts he had honed his entire life caused him to jerk forward and hit the controls to veer the ship to the side.

Turning around to to move was when it happened. The deck below his feet shifted causing him to move rather quickly towards the wall. Hitting the wall somewhat hard he dropped the torch.

Pulled out of the pilot's seat unceremoniously by Yuri, Tevlun grasps onto the Ithorian as the Jedi attempts to put some sense back into the navigator. As the ship lurches under Yuri's control the sudden change of direction causes one of the power relays to the thrusters to burn out. The Snivvian repeats his opinion over the matter of what should be done, "**We must ascend! It's too dangerous to try and land now! Not with the ground array deactivated!**"
Still at the copilot station, Tanith manages to stabilize the ship, using his vast skill as a pilot to offset the sudden course change initiated by Yuri and the resulting blown power relay. It's quickly becoming clear, however, that piloting skill alone won't be enough to get the ship safely on the ground. The LTA afterall wasn't just a beacon pointing the ship in the right direction but also indicated altitude and distance from the ground. While the orbital laster still indicates which direction the ship should be going, the pilot would otherwise be blind.

Snapping his fingers, an idea dawns on him. Standing up in a semi-crouched position, Drem says, **"I've got it! The telemetry might be down due to a higher condensation rate in the atmo, which works like an odd type of reflector. We just need to tweak the output ratio of the receiving telemetry unit to compensate for the reflection. Back when I was in school, there was this really nice Zeltron girl that I used to sit behind … she had the nicest eyes and smelled really nice …"** Again, the goofy smiled came across his face before blurting, **"Uh … anyway, the teacher in that class always said that in these types of conditions, the telemetry units had to be set for G7 rather than F5, which, when I was down working on the panel, is what the output readings were at. So, we just need to crank it up a notch, eh?"** A smug smirk replaced the smile as Drem looked around the room.

**"Hey, cut him some slack will ya? Not everyone´s used to working under pressure, and it usually don´t help to scream at those who aren´t"**
Keeping still behind the pilot seat, Yuri cast a glance back to see how Tendau were doing with the Snivvian tech. Sure, it would be really helpful if he could get it together and offer some real help, but judging from his reaction this was clearly a totally new and terrifying situation for him. Returning his eyes to the forward viewscreen, Yuri scanned intensely for anything that might be dangerous, be it a wind twister or a flying creature of some sort. And, just in case, he also kept his eyes open for a good place to make a crash landing.

*This is not good,*  the Jedi thinks as the sniveen looks barely effected and still nearly as distraught. Looking back to the two humans working furiously at the controls the ithorian states in a rather matter of fact tone, even though his doubts were creeping in on him as the ship plummeted,  **The tech is convinced we must go up with these malfunctions. I think it may be wise to listen to him, although I will differ to your expertise on helm Tanith.**  With that the Jedi braves himself for any more sudden shudders of the falling vessel.

Using Drem's advice concerning the out put readings for the sensor array, Tanith was able to clear up his readings enough of the interference from the magnetic fields and ionosphere to get an idea of where the ship was in relation to the ground. It's nearly impossible to see anything further than 10 meters visually out the viewscreen, the storm's mists and fogs obscuring Yuri's attempts to eyeball obstacles at the current high speed. The rest is up to the pilot's reflexes as Tanith takes the controls. Jarred by the various storm eddies, anyone not properly secured ends up with some very nasty bruises. Finally, the ionosphere clears and the worst of the storms is over though this storm seems to converge on the ground below. The engines whine having taken the worst of the damage during the flight down.
Fog still limits any attempts to use more menial means to navigate, though now that the storm has cleared somewhat, anyone looking out the windows can see almost 30 meters out. The sight of which is an eerie landscape as light seems to shine up from the ground rather than down from the sky.
Rather late, the light for the ground LTA illuminates green, providing the pilot the needed direction to the Locus docking ports. Stricken, the Snivvian navigator had at one point collapsed onto the floor, a large lump forming on his skull from where he hit his head during the descent. He's rather quiet, possibly still shaken from the nasty fall.

Releasing the solid hold he had taken on the pilot chair in order not to be thrown around when the going got rough, Yuri straightened up and watched Tanith walk out of the cockpit. As he went about fixing his gear that had twisted itself in the turmoil, he muttered under his breath, probably not loud enough for Tanith to hear, but most likely loud enough for anyone still in the cockpit to hear.
**"Yeah, his reactions seems to point at this being a regular day at work…"**
Hitting the controls to lower the boarding ramp, Yuri makes his way to exit the ship. He figures to let their testosterone-filled pilot take his aggressions out on the blown parts of the ship, and instead he decides to go outside and have a look. Possibly also to deal with anyone who might be approaching the ship. Walking down the ramp, he hits the switch for his commlink.
**"Hey Drem, you there? I´m going outside for a while. You might want to take a look down in engineering, to make sure our pilot isn´t beating the ship up for not keeping it together under pressure"**

Breathing a slight sigh of relief when the ship finally sets down Garin releases his grip on the hand holds. Quickly stepping out of the way as the others pass by all of them uptight in some way. It seemed obvious that it wasn't the navigators fault that the equipment failed but the Way Tanith regarded the man seemed otherwise. With Tanith and Drem heading down to the engine room Yuri going for a look outside and he Jedi tending to the navigator Garin turned from the cockpit and went to the boarding ramp. He called out to Dram before descending. **"Drem I'll give the outside hull a look over to check for stress fractures and any other damage we may have taken."** Putting on his helmet and activating the seals he started down the ramp.
Once outside he started going over the outer hull of the ship looking for any of the tell tail signs for damage, leaking fluids, venting gases, or just plain outright missing pieces from stress or battle damage.

### **Alicia** (2011-03-14 16:44:46)

The ship has made it safely to one of the docking bays in the Nuetral Zone of the main settlement of Locus. Nyriaan is a dark place, but the wild, almost weed-like bioluminescent fungus produces a significant amount of ambient light coming from the patches which have sprung where ever it can on buildings and other unattended surfaces. Although shrouded in mists and fogs of varying density, the planet's surface is still navigable. The layout of Locus is simi lar to that of most colonial cities. Structures are built low to the ground. Dim, flickering illuminators are placed at even intervals along streets to compensate for the lack of natural light. The air has a stale, musty odor. Areas of high foot and vehicle traffic have less fungal growth, but practically all surfaces in the Neutral Zone-walls, streets, sidewalks-are covered in a thick layer of phosphorescent fungus. The private sectors of the city, including the Corporate City Sector and the Republic Sector, are well secured and nearly impossible to enter without proper authorization.
Yuri's departure has attracted the attention of a rusted protocol driod, who approaches at a quick, lumbering pace as if one of his servos was malfunctioning. As the droid's gaze turns to the rogue Jedi, one of his eyes sputters out as he vocabulator fires up. "**Greetings, sentient. Will you be looking to place your starship in storage? We have a reasonable rate of 25 credits a day for short term storage or 350 credits for a month.**"
Wedging himself beneath the console, Elan quickly realizes there isn't much more to do except remove the component Tevlun had installed. Unfamiliar with either of the systems he realizes it's probably best to withdraw from the time being lest he make things worse. Behind him, Tendau gets to work on getting the Snivvian back to his sense. Apply some applicable bacta to his forehead, the swelling begins to decrease. Noticing Elan mucking about under the console, he suddenly sits straight up, and then has to quickly support himself as he grows dizzy. "**Hey! Don't touch that! It's a rather sensitive piece of equipment.**"
Getting to work in the engine room, Drem and Tanith are greeted by the sight of a few energy relays, ones they had just replaced nearly an hour before which had once again blown. The whole engine could probably use a good looking over as they get to work. Taking a look at the hull Garin takes his time in making a visible sweep over the hull and aside from some bad scoring he doesn't see any fractures in the hull itself.

**"You've gotta be kidding me!"** Drem exclaimed as he looked over the energy relays. **"Sheshka boonta caddah!** With a sharp **KA-TAANG!**, the makeshift engineer tossed a hydrospanner across the room, rebounding it off a wall and onto the floor. **"Tanith, tell me we have more relays in storage.

He didn't remember seeing any additional ones, but hoped he was wrong ... or that they could at least find some in Locus if so.

How the hell are we going to finish this mission?*
**"Question, Drem: when you have two parts that just don't want to work together what do ye do, eh? Can't even get 'em to cooperate long enough to find out if one is more worth the effort than the other?"** Tanith asks as he thinks, wanting someone else's insight but not willing to broach the subject head on.

Clanging around the engine room, Drem could barely hear Tanith over his own fit of frustration.

As the droid queried him for money, it went up for Yuri that he was as good as broke. Not that he cared much for possessions or so, but it seemed he needed to remind his employers that he did expect to get paid for his services. Casting a glance back to the ship, he returned his eyes to the droid.
**"I doubt we´ll be staying for a whole month, but a couple of days or perhaps a week might be suitable. Though since we had a slight mishap with the equipment that we got from here while going down, I would think that the docking fee could perhaps be skipped, as kind of an apology. Otherwise you´ll have to bring it up with the captain of the ship, and he´s not exactly in a good mood"**

Satisfied that their was no significant damage to the outer hull other than cosmetic scarring he doubled back to the ramp where Yuri and a droid were conversing. Over hearing talk of payment and costs of the landing bay he simply approached to stand by Yuri.
**"Outer hull checks out. No loss of structural soundness so we're good there."** He looked at the droid and shook his head indicating that he was not the captain. **"One thing is for sure I don't want to go through the landing precess again."** He paused for a moment as if weighing his question. **"Is Tanith always like that?

The droid's eyes blink as it considers Yuri's words. One eye turning off again as it speaks, "**The array is maintained to the highest of efficiency. You would not have been given clearance to land if there was a suspect of problems. The guild takes their responsibility of bringing travelers down safely very seriously.**" Pausing, "**This is the first time since my activation four years ago that an occurrence like this has been reported. However, I am afraid that I do not have the authority to make the decision regarding waving your docking fees.**" The droid paused again, his eyes blinking. "**There is a directory just outside the starport if you desire information, but I am afraid you will not have access to the city till all fees have been received.**" As the Mandalorian approaches and finding no further need to converse with the wayward Jedi, the droid takes position near the ramp, not going anywhere till the collection has been made.
Finding a couple spare relays from their repair work just hours before, Drem and Tanith manage to easily temporarily reroute the power as they install the new ones. Unfortunately it seems these are the last relays in stock. Working together the repairs will take the better part of an hour.

Hoisting a relay into place, Drem fiddled with it until he finally heard a click from the panel. **"There, one in place."** Turning to Tanith as he wiped a bit more muck from his forehead and splatting it to the ground, he said, **"Honestly, we're all new enough to each other that it's not easy to trust anyone, myself included. And to … top all things … off … c'mon you bantha scaffing herder … it doesn't help that we're cramped together … "** Again, a click was heard as the scout slid the other relay in place with a sigh of relief. **"It doesn't matter who's an ass or who's not, so long as we learn to work together and stay off each other's backs, you know?"**
Grabbing the laser torch, Drem squatted down near the internal relay port and spot welded a few pieces that held the brackets, and, by extension, the relays, in place. **"There, that should hold,"** he stated to himself before turning his attention back to Tanith. **"But, to be fair here, yeah, you can be a bit much to take from time to time, Tanith.

When the droid moved off the the boarding ramp the Mandalorian thought about what Yuri had said about working with Tanith and what Ka'ra had mentioned to him.
**"Yeah he is a good pilot no argument there but weren't you all on a mission with Ka'ra before she asked me to take her place?"** Gairn thought it was odd that Yuri was saying he had worked with Tanith as much as he had.

Or are we just planning on wandering into town and hoping we catch a lead from a random citizen?

Tevlun, catches his wits enough to remove the small handheld interface from the pilotting control.

The droid waiting there, turns his head toward the Snivvian who promptly pulls out an id. It isn't long before the stressed navigator is no longer visable as he rounds a corner out of the hanger.
As each member of the crew leaves the ship, the droid turns his attention to them expantantly waiting for the payment due to the establishment. Once Tanith makes his appearance he echoes the pricing he had given Yuri, inquiring about expected length of the stay.

He stayed quiet for a bit till Tanith's voice came over the comlink in his helmet asking for all to gather in the ship...only to be derailed by Yuri asking for them to come outside. The Mandalorian smiled behind his helmet as he was thinking that Yuri did it again to Tanith. He stopped shaking his head when he was asked about hunting people.
**"Never really did the bounty hunter scene much. Other than some standard old fashion looking up data on a person I don't really have any new tricks. Though generally when I ask people for information the armor generally gets me the answers that I'm looking for."** A slight chuckle can be heard coming from the helmet as he stood there waiting for the others to file out of the ship.

'Gathering info at the local bar, huh?' Elan says as he exits the ship, 'that's my kind of gig. I'm pretty good at the old banter if you want an assist, but I'll need to know at least something about what you're here for to be of any use.'
The Nagai hops down off the side of the ramp and lowers himself on to the edge, sitting with his legs sprawled out as he waits for the rest of the crew to emerge.
'From the sounds of it you crazy kids aren't just here for fun, in any case,' he comments, looking askance at Yuri and Garin from beneath his cap.
'That's fine by me, I don't mind mixing a bit of business with my pleasure.'

**"Guess we´re on the same page then. I´ve got some scattered contacts out there, but on this place, I´ve got nothing. We do have some leads we could follow though"**
Watching more and more of the crew emerge, Yuri turned away from the Mandalorian to watch them. As the Nagai made his appearance, the bounty hunter gave him a quick nod.
**"Seems like as good a place as any to start. And besides, it can always be helpful to get a hold of local events, even if they don´t really concern us"**

Finishing up the repairs, Drem walked to the gangplank and leaned down, listening to all the chatter below. Realizing he was still fairly muck-covered, the scout said, **"I'd better clean up if we're planning on going about town … last thing we need is a greasy shontu spoiling everyone's fun, eh?

We can meet you there and see if you have found anything we can continue to track down.

"**Very well, sentient,**" the droid remarks to Tanith, taking the days worth of credits before turning to lumber away from the ship and toward the next landing pad and to make his rounds.
Upon leaving the pad, an information directory is indeed available for the use of incoming spacers. The console, while looking a bit rundown, comes to life without much difficulty. Providing a great deal about the city you find yourselves in, it conveniently offers a map of the city, while maps of the outlaying areas are upon request only. The neutral zone offers a selection of cantinas being a hub for incoming travelers. Looking at the map, it's discerned Klier's apartment is located at the far southern end of the Neutral Zone while Yrssk's is just north of the spaceport.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Consider the information from the Locale thread available when you gather information from the console. The data may be transferred to a datapad easily enough should that be desired. If there's anything else you wish to know, please let me know.

After exchanging comm data with Tendau and anyone else that wants to swap, Elan hops to his feet and heads away from the landing pad.
'Come on, those drinks won't buy themselves!' he calls cheerily over his shoulder.
Upon discovering the information directory the Nagai accesses the terminal, flicking through the screens and familiarizing himself with the names locations of Locus' various social hubs. He then steps aside to let the others check any information they require, watching the screens with an expression of mild curiosity.

Nodding in agreeably, and trading comm data with Elan, Drem wandered back into the ship and to his room to take a well needed shower. Feeling a bit cleaner, and a bit less stressed, he dressed in his usual gear, grabbing the essentials for wandering about town, and heading back into the common area to track down Tendau. Fastening his blaster in its holster, he smirked at the Ithorian and said, **"There, much better … so where was everyone heading?

After making sure everyone has a way of getting in contact with one another - a dire flaw in the execution of their last mission - Yuri reviews the information they have about their mission so far. It was pretty straightforward: Find the experimental device that Czerka was working on, and take care of it. And along the way, find out what had happened to the missing Republic agents. He figured it wouldn´t be as easy as it sounded though - it never was - but checking out one of the local cantinas would be a simple first step.
He didn´t object when Drem suggested he and Tendau follow later, he had pretty much expected them to have to split up anyway. Checking the information terminal for any useful data he downloaded it to his personal datapad, and started to look for local cantinas or bars that might be a good place to start. While he was working however, he noticed Elan starting to move away from the landing pad. He figured that they had encountered the Nagai in orbit, so he had some local knowledge of the place, and decided to just fall in behind him.
He checked his two primary armaments: The knife and the blaster to make sure they were safely in place. He had no idea how security would be where they were headed, and figured he might very well be asked to give them up. That didn´t concern him all that much though, as he kept his lightsaber safely tucked away under his cloak on his back. Shortly after his exile, he had taken care to have the casing replaced to a more plain and less ornate one, as well as one that dampened as good as all the energy emissions from the weapons energy cell, making it as good as invisible on weapon detectors.

Already having the comm codes for the others he swaps his with Elan's. With that out of the way he checks his weapons. Two, the blaster and vibro dagger, were integrated into his armor. The third, his lightsaber, was hidden in the armor of his right forearm. Not knowing anything other that what was in the briefing they had all received he fell into line with the others bringing up the rear of their formation. Keeping an eye out as they moved. Following them to a cantina he wondered if they would find out any information that pertained to their mission. While a cantina wasn't always the best option it was often the first.

The ithorian checks the location of the agents homes before heading inside the ship to wait for Drem.
After waiting for a few minutes Tendau chuckles at the human as he walks in noticeably much cleaner.  **I believe our companions are heading to the cantina, after we do a bit of information gathering there I believe we may be heading off to the agents homes to see if there are any clues to their current whereabouts.**  Standing up from the common area of the ship where he had been lounging waiting for the scout to return from freshening up, he dons his traditional cloak and swings his medical supplies onto his back.  **Shall we head towards the local watering hole the others did? I'll follow your lead Drem, lead on.** The ithorian jedi says amicably to his human companion as he makes to follow the human towards their current destinations. If they leave the ship, Tendau secures the ship with the authorization codes he and Tanith had been given to the *Atin* on their previous mission together for Ka'ra.

Tanith swaps codes as well, then uses the information terminal to note the address of the Navigator's Guild offices. *I'll have a new navigator for the return flight, and at least the price of the Snivvian's services refunded or I'll be damned,* he thinks as he follows along. He pulls on his helmet as they leave the starport, checking the read-outs and flipping on his heat sensor for a test. *Should've brought my bike, eh? I'll break it out at least once before we leave,* he thinks as he settles his belt, the weight of the personal multitool and survival knife making it ride oddly.

Taking a moment to look around, the scout took a mental inventory of the seedier element, as well as any exits or possible hazards.

Security is slim in this sector, with people coming and going, security gives them only a glance. The heavily armored Wes however catches their attention as the trio make their way toward the local establishment. A pair of security guards make a point of following them to their destination as if to remind the spacers not to cause trouble.
The closest cantina to the spaceport is a rowdy affair with the primary patrons spacers and miners in between their various jobs. Haggard, waitresses go about their task with ease, most with forced smiles as they interact with one patron or another. There are a few tables open spread out though the bulk of the patrons seemed to have converged around the small stage where currently a small band is performing. A Zabrak bartender and his two assistants are busy filling orders to the myriad of customers.

As they came closer to the settlement, Yuri noticed the lack of security, and while he was happy about it in one way, he also realized that it might mean there could be a potential circulation of more powerful arms than just hidden hold-outs or knives. Hopefully they would not have to worry about such things though. As they were nondiscreetly followed to the cantina by a pair of security guards though, something occurred to him. He couldn´t be certain if the guards made a point of following everyone in, or if it was the heavily armored Mandalorian in their company that had drawn their attention, but if it was the former he foresaw a potential problem they did not need.
As they entered the cantina, Yuri looked around for a bit, trying to pick out the best place to sit. He preferred to have as good a view as possible of the place, as well as a relatively clear shot to an exit, should he need one. Once again, he didn´t think precautions like that would be necessary, but it never hurt to be careful. Once he spotted a table that suited him, he sat down and discreetly scratched his temple, activating the comlink in his ear at he same time, making a call back to the two members of the team that they had left behind at the ship.
**"Tendau, you there? I´m sure you figured this out yourself, but you´d do us all a favor if you changed into something a little more inconspicuous than those robes you insist on wearing all the time. Or at least, stuff that lightsaber of yours somewhere it won´t be seen. We were escorted in by a pair of guards, and I´m sure you realize that we won´t be needing the fuzz that might come up if they see it, right?"**
To be entirely honest, Yuri wasn´t sure those things had occurred to the Ithorian at all, but at least he had done what he could to point them out to him. He leaned back into his seat and waited for the others to get whatever drinks they might be going for and settle down before they discussed how to proceed from here. Looking around the cantina, he searched for any points of interest, particularly any kind of gambling establishment.

As they pick up their minders Tanith chuckles to himself, *Heh! Odd enough lot, but not that odd, eh? Mandalorian's likely the cause of it. That armor stands out and caries a well earned reputation, especially this soon after the war. 'Course, I'm probably not helping matters.* As the group enters the cantina Tanith removes his helmet, folding it and strapping it to his shoulder with the epaulet strap that once held evidence of his former rank.
He smiles easily as he makes his way to the bar, exchanging the cordial greetings one always trades in drinking establishments. The weight and shape of his pistols, riding low on his thighs, is so familiar to him he moves as if they are part of him, moving so they do not brush or bang against people or furniture.
**"Barkeep! What liquors have you? Decent swill, if you don't mind. I've celebrating and mourning to do whilst procrastinating, eh?"** he says jovially and loudly enough to be heard as he gives a conspiratorial wink to the bartender.

Garin walked along with Yuri and Tanith towards their destination following along and intermingling with all the others that are also coming and going from the space port. Security was sparse and they didn't draw much attention till they passed a check point and drew a tail. Not caring about the security personnel he continued to follow Yuri and Tanith.
Entering the cantina Tanith was quick to split off heading to the bar. Not interested in a drink at the moment he continued farther in with Yuri in search of a table. Finally finding a table that was best suited for them he sat down looking past Yuri to see what was taking place behind the bounty hunter. Looking to his side he saw Tanith up at the bar doing what he did best, turning and burning with the patrons up there. Looking back to Yuri the he would have raised an eyebrow if he hadn't been wearing his helmet. **"Are the others on their way?"**

Laughing friendly towards Drem the ithorian points o the ship and the already locked down entrance ramp.  **Already locked her down Drem, and I guess we should hurry f we way to catch the others while they are still at the cantina.**  The Jedi says as he and his human companion start to make their way towards their destination.
As they are striding along Tendau receives Yuri's message and pauses for a moment. Well less inconspicuous aparrel wouldn't hurt he thought, bit where would he get it.  **Yuri that's not a bad idea, but the delima that I'm running into is that I don't have any other apparrel, and I do not have a concealed holster for my saber, and I am unwillig to be unable to defend myself or anyone else for that matter by leaving my weapon behind, maybe we can stop off at a merchant or rig one up later, for now I'll make due with what I have and try not to draw more attention to any of you.**  The ithorian finishes and continues to make progress toward the local watering hole.

Yuri nodded at Garin and held up a hand to signal for him to hold just a moment. He kept himself from making an audile sight which would have sounded quite odd over the comlink before he answered the Ithorian.
**"At this moment I´d say the most likely reason you would have to fight is if someone sees you with that saber. You weren´t hired to be the muscle on this job, we´ve got people for that. Sure if you don´t want to leave it behind, but I´m asking you to put it somewhere it won´t be the first thing to get into the face of everyone you meet. And no, I don´t care if you´ve got a proper holster or not, put the damn thing in you underwear if you have to"**
Closing the comlink he let out the sigh and turned to look at Garin.
**"They seem to be on their way. Unfortunately one of them is looking like a fully dressed Jedi, so we´d better hope there aren´t that many people that have ever seen a live one. And especially that none of them knows there´s a bounty on Jedi these days"**

Garin simply shook his head at the news from Yuri. He could understand the Jedi wanting to not be defenseless but openly carrying a lightsaber was a bad idea. That and it would cause more trouble for them in gathering information. A sigh escaped from his helmet. **"He does realize that he can just clip to to the far side of either hip to further conceal it doesn't he?"** He paused for just a second. **"It's a good weapon no doubt. If I had one I would not want to be without it either. Which brings up another thing. Just because one carries a weapon like that doesn't automatically make them a follower of that tradition."**
He looked out at the patrons as he thought about it. **"Either way him showing up should spice things up a bit."**

**"Well, good or not, I´d prefer if I didn´t need any weapons at the moment. And it´s not just the saber, apparently those robes is the only set of clothing he owns. Guess it´s a good thing we´re here to keep him alive isn´t it?"**
Still looking around the cantina, Yuri extended himself into the Force, to try and sense the presence of anyone else trained in its use around him. It was a common habit he had acquired since he came on the run from the Sith. He had no idea why any of their assassins might be in a place like this, but he was a cautious fellow. Drumming his fingers on the tip of the table, he looked at the Mandalorian.
**"So, where do you suggest we start? I was thinking of hitting the local card sharks to see what they might know, but unfortunately it seems like our good republic have forgotten to pay me for our last job"**

Chuckling that they were more concerned with his appearance rather than that of the fully armed and armored mandolorian the Jedi lets out an exasperated chuckle.

It was then that he felt a stirring in the Force from across the table and from behind his helmet his eyebrows shot up. ***Interesting I wasn't expecting that from this one. That makes two force users in the group. Three including me. Question is, is he a Jedi?*** He thought quickly as he used his own ability to draw his presence in the Force in an attempt to hide himself from the bounty hunter. It wasn't so much an effort to deceive someone on the team but for the moment the less that knew about his ability the better. Besides if the poodoo did hit the fan he might be forced to call upon his ability giving himself away.
Looking back to Yuri he shrugged his armored shoulders. **"That would work as well as anything. Unfortunately I'm in the same situation with credits as you are. And if you haven't been paid for your last job I'm wondering just when I'll get paid for this?"**

Elan seems uncaring about the group's unwanted escort, though when they fall in behind the Nagai becomes more attentive to the other people around them as well as the scenery and buildings they pass. A known threat doesn't worry him; the possibility of an ambush does.
He retains his trademark smile but even so visibly gains a bounciness to his step as soon as they pass through the door of the cantina. It seems clear he is now in his element.
Walking with Tanith to the bar, Elan leans nonchalantly on the counter and shows the bartender his hand, four of his fingers upraised.
'Four Alderaanian beers and the same amount of Ithorian Mist chasers,' he says to the bartender while grinning at Tanith, 'that suit you?'

**"Guess that´s a perk for them by having us doing undercover work. Since we can´t really be traced back to them, we can´t really prove we´ve worked for them, and they really don´t have to pay us. Though I suppose they won´t make a fuss about it, but they apparently need a reminder"**
Rubbing his head a bit, Yuri felt that a thin veil of hair had started to grow out again. Might as well let it, he reasoned, as he had kept it bald now for some time. When living on the run, shifting your appearance from time to time seemed like a good idea. He looked down at the cloak he wore wrapped around him, and for a moment he missed walking around in Jedi robes. He couldn´t really explain it, but it was most likely his interactions with the Ithorian that had made old memories of how it had been to walk as a Jedi surface again. It seemed like forever since he had buried them. But they would remain buried a little while longer. While he did keep a set of old robes hidden away at a loyal friend, the cloak he wore at the moment served him just fine. It was of military issue, designed for special forces use in various terrain, and could render an individual nearly invisible in most types of terrain. When work inside out, like he did, it mainly looked like a black poncho though, and was only really good for night camouflage.
Of course, he had the Force to make him completely invisible, but he preferred not to be dependent on those skills to keep him hidden. Besides, the cloak had other nice properties as well. The fabric was well-made, and the way if flowed could conceal pretty much any movement that went on underneath. He paused for a moment to look at the armored warrior across the table. Some would argue that armor made him invincible, but Yuri knew that any warriors best armor was his will and his instincts. And in the case of Jedi, the Force. Watching the second duo of their team make their way over at the bar, Yuri shifted the topic of conversation while waiting for them.
**"By the way, I asked Ka'ra before if she could give me a crash course in the Mandalorian language. Seeing as she ain´t around, I was thinking maybe you could take up the challenge. I´ve picked up some pieces of it during the recent war and in the aftermath, but as you can understand that´s a very limited vocabulary"**

Garin nodded as Yuri finished talking about weather or not they would get paid for their work. From what the bounty hunter had said the didn't sound good. Then again Ka'ra would not have thrown in if they weren't willing to pay for services rendered. **"Well here's hoping that Ka'ra is a good judge of character then. I don't think that she would have gotten involved is they weren't willing to pay. Still like you said it can't hurt to remind them now and then."**
Looking back to the bar he saw Elan and Tanith getting drinks. He wasn't really thirsty and neither did he like combining drinking with work as one had the ability to negatively impact the other. He took the moments silence and focused of looking around again though at the sound of Yuri's voice he turned his head as he shifted in his chair. **"I can do that. Though I do wonder what the interest is as few outside of the clans have a need to know it."**

As Tendau and Drem make their way to join the others at the cantina, the Ithorian's attire seems to draw little attention. After all, the simple garments could be found on any humble, hard working denizen across the galaxy. Other than the small security presence in the area, there's not much Drem can see that's unusual. He does however spot a couple advertisements for a local junk yard which sells discounted parts. It's not long before the pair make it to the rendeavous, passing a pair of security conversing between themselves nearby at a corner.
One of the assistants takes the Nagai and pilot's order, reaching down below eye level of the counter to pull out a few bottles of the ale setting them with a clink onto the counter. "**Sorry, don't have any of the mist chasers,**" he says reaching for a tall glass and pouring in a dark red liquid into it which seems to glow in the dimly lit cantina. "**And the bloke over there took the last bottle of whiskey,**" he said, indicating a boisterous man sitting at a table in the middle of the cantina. With two female and four male companions it's quickly apparent they're the main source of the rowdiness. "**Next shipment won't be for another week, bloody import fees understand.**" He pauses looking back at the head barkeep before his gaze comes back and he leans in on the pretense of taking the chip. "**There is something else which can pack quite a punch if you're interested.**" His eyebrows raise questioningly as he looks at Tanith.

**It's this one I believe,**  the ithorian says to his companion as they approach the cantina that had been agreed upon to meet at. Striding forward and through the door the jedi makes sure his weapon is concealed beneath his cloak and double checks that the human is following him as he enters the building. Scanning the crowd nonchalantly he lets his gaze wander across the room and the many faces present and begins to make his way towards the bar. Reaching out with his senses he looks to locate his comrades and also to safeguard against any one who may wish to do himself or his companions harm.  **Drem do you see any of our companions?**  Tendau inquires to the scout as they meander their way through the cantina.

Drem winced a bit as he entered the cantina as the scent of sweat, grime and metal hit him like a hammer and left a raw iron taste in his mouth. Smacking his lips a few times, he hoped the grumble of carousing would drowning out the warble of the vid-player where Grotto Van's Greatest Hits droned on with his 'Outer Rim Irregulars'. Rubbing his temples, the scout grit his teeth in thought. *Ugh … I thought this music died out a few years ago. Leave it to me to find the one place in the galaxy that's hoping for a revival.* Looking around, Drem motioned to his Ithorian crewmate to follow him to the bar. **"Let's head over to the bar … might have a better vantage point there … not to mention that I could use a drink."** Looking around as he stepped into the crowd, he winced again as the smell got stronger. *Between the smell and that music, I can see why one would drink themselves into a stupor.*
Once at the bar, Drem motioned to the bartender, before noticing a few of their companions also at the bar. Nodding to them, he waited patiently till the bartender came to them. **"I'll take a blue milk and shot of lum …**  Looking to Tendau, he waited for the Ithorian to also place an order, motioning to the others that they'd be right there.

**"Lousy Ranat loving barv,"** Tanith grumbles at the loud man in the middle of the room. He takes up his drink before turning back to the bartender. **"I'll try almost anything once, friend. What's it made of, eh? And who is the whiskey thief and why's he hate me? Got any brandies? Or maybe a decent spiced rum?"** he asks.

As the bartender looks in his direction the ithorian smiles and says,  **Just a jawa juice please.**  Upon recieving their drinks the ithorian thanks the bar keep and pulls out his cred chip with it's meager remaining funds to cover his and his human companion's beverages. After paying he motions to Drem to lead on and makes to follow him depending on where he heads out to.

Garin laughed at Yuri's comment about the other Mandalorians he had met an how that didn't stack up to expectations. **"Verd ori'shya beskar'gam. A warrior is more than his armor."**. He translated as he looked at the force sensitive that sat across the table. **"Though the same can be said for just about every race, tradition or following. Each has their share that gives te whole a bad reputation."**. He paused for a moment. **"Look at the Jedi. It seems that every so often one of their order falls to the dark side and causes major trouble for the galaxy at large. Yet no one polices them for future Sith Lords."**. He shrugged his shoulders. **"Like I said no matter where one looks that will find the unsavory within their ranks."**
When he finished talking he felt a presence in the force near the entrance. Turning his head he saw the Jedi and Drem enter through the cantina door. **"Looks like our stragglers have finally shown up."**

Yuri met Garin laugh with a smile of his own.
**"True, but no other group is really able to fall back on the whole "we held the Galaxy at its throat" argument when demanding respect. What is laughable is that sometimes that´s all they have to come with. So it would be gold worth if I could remind them of the fact that they did lose the war *and* hand them a little something in their own tongue"**
He listened carefully while the Mandalorian spoke about the Jedi, but couldn´t detect anything that hinted of any particular feelings either for or against the Order.
**"Well, not that there´s much left to police these days, but I get your point.

Drem reached to pay for their drinks when he saw his crewmate beat him to the punch. Not wanting to seem ungrateful, he smiled to the Ithorian and said, **"Guess I'll get the next round."** Taking the lead that was given to him, the scout waked over to Yuri and Garin, gingerly holding both his drinks in both hands. Raising said drinks in a celebratory manner, he quickly drank the shot of lum and chased it with the glass of milk. Letting out a loud **"Ahhh!"**, Drem reached into his pack and produced a few bantha sticks as he grinned and said, **"Bah weep graaaaagnah weep ni ni bong"** before offering said snacks to any takers. **"Well, with the exception of their taste in music, this place has decent drinks.

The bartender nods, "**Just local stuff at present, though the Nyriaanans don't make a bad brandy.**" Picking up an opaque bottle, he pours it into a wide bottomed glass the liquid itself giving off a slight glow as he hands it over. "**He goes by Hank, he's a hot shot miner working for the private sector,**" he says glancing back at the boisterous man who have ordered the whiskey. "**As for the other stuff… You probably don't want to know what it's made of, but if you want to get hit fast it will do the job. Locals call it *vapulus*.**" The bartender, still holding onto Elan's chip addresses him as he does the tally of the bill. "**That's 15 credits each for the ales, 5 for the local, and 10 for the brandy,**" he recounts taking the total amount off the Nagia's chip before handing it back. From a small cabinet he withdraws a tray and waits a moment to see if they want anything else.

Tanith sniffs and then takes a slow sip of the brandy, giving it a swish to let it hit the back taste buds before letting it ease down. The quality shocks him, this is probably the smoothest and sweetest brandy Tanith has ever had. It gives little burn but great warmth as it settles in his stomach. The unexpected joy is plain on his face as he looks down at the glass. **"Barkeep, I may be interested in a case or two of this to take with me when we leave. Now for the ale,"** he says as he lifts the ale. It is thick and pleasantly bitter, with no long lingering after taste, *Decent,* he thinks, *but I've had far better.*
**"It is good my friend, very good. Have one of the lasses keep an eye on our drinks, eh?"** he says as he tosses a ten-cred for a tip and moves to follow Elam back to the table. He looks around the bar for their quarry, doubting he would spot or recognize them but looking anyway, *Never know, might get lucky, heh!*

Elan grins as the assistant and Tanith converse, clearly happy to be in the presence of people who appreciate a good drink.
He returns his credit chip to the safety of his trouser pocket and, as the pilot samples his own beverages, he transfers the other glasses to the tray provided. Lifting it securely in both hands the Nagai weaves his way back through the busy cantina to the table of his new companions, places the tray reverently in the centre of the table, and rotates it with no small ceremony until both Yuri and Garin have a paired shot and beer directly in front of them.
'Drink up, mates!' Elan hoots loudly as he takes a seat across from them, then continues in a more private mutter: 'seriously, drink if you want to get information. In a bar, nobody trusts a man who appears to be entirely sober.'

**"Really? And here I was thinking bartenders were among the more trusted persons in a bar, *and* usually the best sources of information"**
The bounty hunter didn´t really put any value into the statement, and just expressed it in the same tone as the Nagai, only meaning to mirror out the others tone of his statement being absolute. Not wanting to be insulting to Elan, he took the glass of beer in front of him and took a sip.
**"So, let´s get down to business, shall we?"**

## Re: Chapter Two: Children of the Tempest

### **simplyscribed** (2011-04-09 16:01:26)

Elan nods agreeably.
'Bartenders do indeed pick up a lot of rumours - though to get more solid information I would choose to go to the original storytellers where possible,' he replies, gesturing around at the locals and spacers within the cantina to emphasise his point, 'but the bartender isn't likely to talk to anyone who wanders in and starts asking questions without even so much as buying a drink either.'
The Nagai waves his hand airily, dismissing the dialogue as insignificant.
'Down to business then, like you say. What exactly *is* your business?'

Tanith sits and takes another pull from the local ale. **"Been wondering about that myself. Figured I'd leave the dissemination to you lot, now that you're all here,"** he says, swirling the brandy in its sniffer. **"Beyond that, well this is Yuri's bag, isn't it? Where do we go from here, lad?"**

Garin didn't get a chance to answer the bounty hunter as Drem sat down at the table. Not that he couldn't have answered but the Mandalorian had to wonder if Yuri was also keeping his Force Sensitivity a secret from the others. ***Probably not the Ithorian though. He might know even if he did just join this group.*** Left to his thoughts he simply looked around as Drem spoke.
**"You haven't missed much"** His voice sounded out form his helmet. Looking back to the bar where the others are he indicates with his head that one is approaching. Elan came to the table with a try full of drinks. The Nagai seemed to be enjoying himself as he expertly turned the tray till drinks were in front of those seated talking about not people not trusting those in a bar that are too sober. ***What if one doesn't trust many either way?*** He thought quietly as he for the moment left the offered drinks in front of him as the last of the group arrived at the table and the conversation got down to business. It didn't take long for Tanith to point out that this was Yuri's specialty once again seemingly starting the contest between them. He waited for Yuri's answer before saying anything.

*Crap…I should have chosen something else as a disguise…traveling con man perhaps…*
Figuring it comes with his pretended job as a bounty hunter, Yuri decides that he might as well accept the role of leader at this point. Everyone else seemed to think he should anyway, even though he suspected that Tanith might be more interested in seeing him fail than having any genuine faith in his abilities. And then there was the case of the Nagai, who seemed to think he was the only one having visited a bar before...how much should he tell him about their mission?
He decided not to worry about Tanith for the moment, unless he started to actively jeopardize their mission again. Instead, he leaned back in his seat, looking around the place once again.
**"Well, we came here to gather information, so let´s do just that. I´d suggest you spread out, solo or in pairs, and looks in the places you think you can poke around in without drawing too much attention. While we do have some leads to follow, we should start by getting a feel of the local climate…see if you can find out anything special going on, even if it´s not related to our mission. Things tend to have a way of clicking together when you least expect them too"**
He turned his head towards Tanith and Elan, and stopped at the Nagai.
**"We´re here to investigate the whereabouts of some missing persons, but I´m sure you can understand if you´re kept on a need to know basis"**

**"Sounds good lad. I work best with pilots and drunks, so I'll stay around the spaceport and the cantinas. We need parts anyway, and I can get them here, eh? Who's going with me?"** Tanith asks, unsure about the advice given. *I mean, bloody hell, do I just wander around asking for them by name? Nah, I always here more than I want to around other spacers. If they know anything they'll wind up telling me eventually. Might see about checking the registries on outbound ships, see if they've left the planet,* he thinks as he waits for his volunteer partner.
*When a body doesn't listen, set an example, Mama Lia used to say. I'll follow the boy's lead to the best of my ability, maybe he'll learn not to buck his allies this way,* he thinks as he tosses back the last of the brandy and sets the empty sniffer on the table. *Wonder if they've any tabac around here? Wonder how much it would be? Aye, money,* he remembers. **"We've got about two grand in liquid funds, but we still have parts to buy. Who knows? Maybe some lucrative work will present itself while we go about our business."**

Sitting down at the table with the others Tendau listens to the planning and how they may possibly try to locate the missing operatives.  **I agree that splitting up and checking more places will probably yield quicker and more profitable results, but I would venture so far as to say searching for two very different beings and asking about both may put up their captors guard. Perhaps we should divide up who we are searching for as well. Also a glaring hole in our plan does seem to be staring us in the face. Elan here has no idea what we are doing here, but has been helping us regardless, Drem you seem to be the one who knows him best, I suggest you fill him in with as much information as you trust him with so we can be better prepared for this part of our task.**  The Jedi says as he takes a draw from his jawa juice awaiting his companions responses.

'Need to know basis,' Elan echoes, 'I've got you. Not to worry, I'm not offended: I wouldn't trust you lot as far as I can throw you if the situation were reversed.'
The Nagai looks Garin up and down, taking in his armour.
'And I doubt I could throw you very far.'
He tosses back his brandy and whistles in appreciation, then quietly listens to the rest of the exchange.
When Tendau suggests Drem put him in the loop the Nagai nods in apparent acceptance of this suggestion.
'One thing I should add is that I have skills that could be of some use in your search. I'm rather good at finding things. My old teacher-' here he pauses momentarily, glancing at Tendau, 'he always said I had a knack for discovery. People, objects, information, you name it. To survive in my business it's a necessary talent.'

Leaning back and chuckling when Tanith mentions lucrative work, Yuri shoots the other a glance.
**"I don´t know about lucrative, but I can usually find out a thing or two around a game table. If luck is on my side, I could possibly even increase our resources a bit"**
When Tendau voiced his concerns, he listened wile sipping a bit of his beer. Whether he realized it or not, he sounded quite naive and frankly...green, for a lack of better words, in Yuri´s eyes. It did reinforce Yuri´s belief that the Ithorian had lived most of his life inside the Jedi Temple, and wasn´t quite as familiar with many aspects of the outside world as he suspected the rest of their crew was. Misguided prejudice? Perhaps, but until he knew more, he could only work from assumptions.
He was about to say something when Elan spoke, and he waited until the Nagai had finished, glad to hear he had no trouble with not being let into the full loop just yet.
**"Glad to hear that, and I´m sure we´re gonna need skills of all kind to get through this thing. But just to emphasize, Tendau, I do not recommend that you walk around and ask direct questions about our objectives just anywhere. Look for information about what may be going on here, query someone about the last clip on the big screens, and just generally act like you are a new arrival, looking to get a hold of the local situation. Which is exactly what we are at this point. And if opportunity presents itself to make a probing query related to our objectives, or possibly their last place of employment, try and do so discreetly"**
After taking another sip of his beer, he took note of something else Tendau had said.
**"Also, I don´t think we have enough information at this point to assume anything about the whereabouts of our objectives. For all we know, they are as likely to have passed out in a drunken daze in some back alley as to have been captured"**

Chuckling the ithorian finds it most humorous his directness with his allies seems to be received as ignorance.  **Ky friend I agree that is a possibility, but I merely saying if five armed and armored men from all walks of life all start inquiring at the same time about the same two people, it may be conceived as a bit strange, while divided we are two to three beings looking for one old comrade who may be proving a bit more difficult than usual to locate. As to informing our compatriots, I find it only right that one who may be risking heir neck with us be given the chance to properly address the situation.**  Sighing internily the jedi forces a smile and mutters something under his breath abbot obstinate padawans always finding new crusades when they should listen to the council.

**"Hold a second friends, we have addresses for both, wouldn't that be a good starting point?"** he says as he turns back to the conversation. **"We could split into two groups and check both before the day is out."**

Yuri rubbed his head slightly, feeling the stub of hair that had been growing out lately, and he was becoming more and more happy that Elan had placed something to drink in front of him. While listening, he looked to Garin and Drem for support - two men who seemed to be among the more reasonable in the group. When Tanith was done, he took his glass and raised in the direction of the pilot and took a slightly larger sip.
**"That we do, and if people thinks that is a better way to go about it, then by all means. I´m only offering my opinions since it was insisted that I do so"**
Placing the glass back on the table, he let his eyes drift over to Tendau as he spoke.
**"The reason I suggested we first get a grip of the local situation is because we have no idea what´s going on around here, and in what ways it may affect our mission. Let´s say one of our objectives have decided to go public with some rather…dirty information about his former employees. In that case we might want to accelerate our goal of making contact with him, as he might be in danger. On the other hand, perhaps they have done something that have caused them to become viewed with dislike, we might want to avoid making direct contact with them as much as possible.
And just to iterate again, we would not be asking direct questions about our objectives, but rather probe around for local information, and if possible, push in discreet queries related to our mission. Now did everyone understand my proposal, or do I need to elaborate even further?"**

Garin sat there and looked at Tanith, Tendau and Yuri went back and forth. Irritation flashed but subsided rather quickly when he took a deep breath to calm himself. ***The way they bicker I'm surprised we didn't win the war.*** He saw the look that Yuri gave him and he figured that the bounty hunter was looking for some back up to his plan. When he finished speaking he shifted slightly in his chair.
**"Look both ideas have merit. Knowing whats happening here on the planet is important as is checking on where they live. Should be walk right up the their places of residence and knock on the door. Frak no."** He looked at Tanith. **"Mind you I'm not saying that was your intent but maybe some surveillance might be in order. Another thing. If I go anywhere with a group I'm going to stick out like a whore at a prayer service. If you're looking for subtle I'm not your man."** He stopped for a second before continuing. **"I can always ask around if Czerka is looking for people to provide security or protection. That would raise less suspicion considering my appearance."**
He looked at the Jedi, Tanith and Yuri. **"Look I understand that a committee is a way to get things done but it often causes more problems that its worth."** He looked at Tanith. **"If you tell someone that this is their bag and then don't like what they have to say then next time don't give them the controls. I don't know what's between you two nor do I care. I'm here for what Ka'ra brought me on for not to referee a school yard pissing contest."**

*I swear by the Force, this was so much easier when it was just me and Jonah…why did I ever stop working alone…?*
Thankful when Garin stepped into the conversation, Yuri didn´t bother to comment that he thought the Mandalorian might need to calm down a notch or two and not see everytime someone didn´t agree all at once as a "schoolyard pissing contest". But he agreed, offer things up for debate was often more useful to invite trouble than to resolve everything, and it usually depended completely on the group of people at hand. He just wanted to show people that if someone else had a suggestion that everyone else agreed on better, then fine. He wasn´t perfect, but he wasn´t enjoying the seat of first being looked at to provide all the answers, only to hear that he was wrong. At least Tanith had been able to offer an alternative solution, as opposed to the Ithorian Jedi, who didn´t even seem to listen.
He gave Garin a nod of thanks, and even though he didn´t really like that he always came out as a troublemaker, he figured that somewhere it had to be some truth to the old saying that it take two to argue. He knew when he felt something was his fault and when he didn´t care, but he was a professional and wouldn´t pursue issues that was fruitless. Rather than say something, he just waited.

If we were Mandos the lad and I wouldn't have issues. Damned Mandos are good like that,* he thinks. **"Right, so local news. We are still doing the pairs, correct?

Pondering all the information put forth the Jedi takes a deep breath and interjects.  **Getting a pulse on local politics is a good call Yuri, and surveillance on their homes may be of some use. Also working security for Czerka may allow us some more leverage into their plans. I think it may work best like that, maybe have Garin apply with Czerka, maybe have Drem or Elan do the same but as a mechanic? And have the rest of us split into teams of two and get a beat on the local situations. Reconvene back at the  *Arin* afterwards and then send those of us not undercover with Czerka on surveillance around our two missing operatives homes if we haven't been given Amy better leads before then.**  Taking a deep breath after that deluge of information he awaits the response of his companions.

Elan smiles in a vague sort of way as his new companions turn on each other like so many katarns fighting over a defenceless wookiee cub. He nods his gratitude to Tanith as the pilot orders yet another drink and takes a large gulp of beer to hasten the replacement's necessity.
Internally he process all the information gleaned from the discussion which, it turns out, is quite a lot. He wonders if any of the group are truly conscious of just how much they're airing publicly in a crowded bar.
*Why*, he thinks, *if I only knew the names of the pair they're searching for I'd basically be in the loop. So much for "need to know"*.
Finally, he decides to throw them a bone.
'Hold,' he says, raising his hand in front of him. He then leans forward, casually rather than conspiratorially, and mutters: 'I don't want to tell you lot your jobs, whatever they are, but this doesn't seem to be the right place to have this debate. If you don't mind a neutral party having his say, I think I've just about grasped the nature of what you're doing here... and I think I've assessed at least a little bit about yourselves as well.
'So... for the time being, why don't I and Tanith crawl the cantinas and hangouts to see what information we can dig up. Our resident man-hunter,' here he nods at Yuri, 'can take Drem and Tendau: they can get a feel for the area, maybe check out these locations you mention and how well secured they are. The Mandalorian... well, he's right, he stands out.'
Elan looks Garin over thoughtfully.
'And that's no bad thing. The more obvious you are, the less attention paid to the rest of us. In fact if you want to get recruited as an inside man drawing some attention might be just what you want to do. And I know a big strong Mando like you is too confident to worry about flying solo.'
'This is as a preliminary plan. If more is necessary we can discuss it over comms or in private... Well,' he questions, looking round at them, 'how about it?'

After a final drink, the group splits up, each going their separate ways. With the intention of fixing up the ship, Drem gets the needed credits from Tanith and heads back to the *Atin Oya'ka*.
Elan and Tanith, though have the opportunity to remain in the cantina as the waitress brings Tanith over another round of the local brandy. She sets the glass down, before picking up the empty glasses while looking at the few rounds left untouched. “**Did you want to open a tab, hun?**” she inquirers, giving Elan a smile. “**Anything I can get for ya?**”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
With Klieri’s apartment being the closest, Yuri and Tendau sets off to stack out the place before continueing their investigation. The apartment complex, a sprawling three story building, is found easily enough in the southern end of the Neutral Zone. The neighborhood itself is on the lower end of the social scale. Rough looking characters linger on the streets laughing, joking and otherwise carrying on during these daylight hours, though considering the perpetual darkness might seem irrelevant what time of day it is. There’s a steady stream of tenants coming to and from the building as the trio watch, but none of them match the description of their wayward agent. A tired looking security guard sits at a station near the building’s front entrance and occasionally takes a shift wandering the halls of the first floor. He doesn’t stop any one from entering, though he gives any new comers a thoughtful and hard glance as he spots them.
Heading inside, the halls are clean for the most part, with only occasional spots of old stains and small patches of slow-growing phosphorescent fungus on the floors and walls. Klieri’s apartment is on the second floor near the western end, conveniently located near an emergency stairwell. The closed apartment door, upon checking, is sealed by an electronic lock.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a long walk, where he earns the long awkward glances of other pedestrians who quicken their pace upon spotting him, Garin is finally able to locate an office for Czerka. Located at the edge of Czerka Corporate Sector, the two story office building is aptly placed just outside the main and heavily guarded gate leading out of the Neutral Zone into the sector. Any attempts to enter through the gate is cut off by the impressively armed stationed guards. The sector is heavily trafficked by armed security and high walls toppled by stun fields surround it on all sides.
Entering the building Garring meets pair of Czerka uniformed armored guards standing just inside the main doors. One of them stops the Mandalorian before he can proceed any further down the long, main hallway. “**Business?**”

*And off they go to do what they just told me was a stupid idea. Bah! It is what it is, eh?* Tanith thinks watching the others depart. As the waitress appears and delivers the brandy he puts on his best roguish grin, **"Many thanks, lass, and yes, I'll open a tab. Tell me, what is there to do around here? I've a mind to let off some steam and relax eh?"**

Elan opens his mouth to reply to the waitress in the affirmative but is interrupted by Tanith opening a tab of his own. With a shrug and a wink directed at the waitress, he settles back in his chair and lets the other man talk, all the while maintaining eye contact with the girl whenever she chooses to look in his direction.
Information flows more freely from the mouths of the distracted, after all.

The waitress requests Tanith's credit chip for the tab, writing down his order in the process. At the mention of letting off some steam she gives the older man a small wink of her own "**There isn't much actually. Nyriaan isn't exactly known for it's parties after all. Not many actually want to be here, mostly miners wanting to get rich off the madilon or those unlucky enough to piss their employer off and get sent here.**" Her eyebrows raise in question for a moment, silently asking which category the two fell under. "**You could probably find some good parties in the evenings. Just be careful how far from the spaceport you get. Security doesn't bother solving problems in the slums, but you're likely to get on the bad side of some Hutt.**"
Giving the pair another dashing smile, she adds, "**There's other options to consider depending on what you're looking for.**"

Realizing that any objections would only lead to more discussions, and like Garin he felt like they didn´t need more of that, Yuri just shrugged his shoulders and finished his drink before they took off. He still didn´t think this was the optimal way to go about their business, but he figured he´d better do what he could to make it go as smooth as possible rather than object.
As they watched outside and then went inside, Yuri looked around, trying to catch anything odd in the neighborhood: People wearing some kinds of emblems or gang marks on their clothing, the level of armament of the tenants, and the general mood of the population.
As they walked through the corridor, reaching the door of their subjects apartment, the ex-Jedi reached out with his Force senses into the room behind the door, to get a feel for if anyone was inside. Trying to look inconspicuous, he took a few steps to the side and looked up and down the emergency stairs, just looking curious.

Departing with the others Garin gave them a parting nod. **"I'll let you know how I make out."** With noting more left to say he was on his way. Not really knowing where to go he looked for an information kiosk. Finding one not far away he brought up the location of the Czerka offices and got his bearings.
It turned out to be a decent walk from the cantina. It gave him plenty of time to think things over as people gave him a wide berth from the other pedestrians. Their little band had its share of problems and from his perspective it was the friction between Yuri and Tanith. The two just didn't get along or see the others perspective. Those two things didn't make for a healthy working relationship. He just hoped it didn't get worse.
Left with his thoughts as he kept a watchful eye the walk was over quicker than expected. Arriving at the Czerka building that stood just inside the neutral zone he gave the building a look over. It wasn't very impressive being only two stories but then again not much on this planet was impressive. Continuing into the building he came upon two armed uniformed Czerka guards who stood just inside the main door watching him approach. One was holding up a hand indicating for him to stop and inquired about his business.
Turning his head to the man he looked at him. If his presence here bothered the man he didn't show it. **"Work."** He said as his voice came from his helmet. **"I've recently arrived on this planet. I've heard that there may be the possibility of work for people with my set of."** He let the last word drag out a bit. **"Skills."**

Garrin
The guard gives a small laugh, taking up his earlier position - relaxed but alert - at the door "**You've come at a bad time. We've got all the help we need.**" He gives a shrug. "**Take the next left, second door. Maybe you'll get lucky.**"
The pair continue to watch the Mandalorian as he follows the directions. The hallway is deceptively short and the hallway unnoticeable till he's practically right on it. Passing the first door labeled "Reception" is open and he can spot several chairs for waiting guests and a long desk set at the back wall facing the door. The receptionist, a female Arkanian, looks up as she sees Garrin pass, but then goes back to work. The second door is on the left and bears the name "Sergeant Draco Holkins". It's currently closed with no sign it's currently occupied.

As Tendau and Yuri depart from their companions, the Jedi begins to feel a bit uneasy as the surroundings generally seem to become more dilapidated. Following the human's lead the Jedi reaches out with his force enhanced senses and starts to pay attention for those who may be paying them a bit too much attention and any one who is openly hostile as they approach the building. After passing the watchful guard and making sure his robe thoroughly concealed his lightsaber he again follows the human's lead as they begin inconspicuously checking the area around the apartment. As he searches around the outside of the apartment for anything denoting a struggle or completely out of the ordinary in the hallway and the emergency stairwell he reaches out with his own senses in an effort to locate any one inside the apartment. Turning to the human while he reaches out with his senses he inquires,  **I may have been a bit to blazen about the plan, what would your next move be my friend?** The ithorian asks quietly and quite sincerely to his compatriot.

Yuri and Tendau
After investigating the various aspects of the complex, they both come up with the same conclusion: the apartment itself is empty. Knocking or ringing the bell confirms their suspicion, as not even a sound is heard within. The door is sealed with a simple electronic lock, a task which would normally require a security kit to open but considering how mundane the lock is could be jury rigged without it.

Resisting the urge to say something about people who first looks to someone for solutions, then bashes those solutions without something better to come with, and then turns back to the first person for yet more solutions, Yuri tuns back from the emergency stairway. While casting looks at both the door, Tendau, and the corridor they´re in, he ponders their next move. He wished he hadn´t been slacking off in his attention near the end of the discussion, as it would obviously have made more sense to send someone like Drem or Elan to the apartment, as there were some breaking and entering going to be required.
Still, he had ways for that as well, but they weren´t optimal for this situation. It was hard to say what would be the best approach. There weren´t really any good places to set up an observation point on the apartment, and even if they could set something up outside, they´d need to split up to try and cover all exits. Besides, he couldn´t help thinking that the case may have been left untouched for too long, and that their target would not return to the apartment, but that clues inside might lead them to his whereabouts.
Moving closer to the door, he decides to try a slightly rough technique. Turning his head, he looks at his Ithorian partner.
**"Hey, would you mind taking a look to see if anyone´s heading this way?"**
Lowering a hand to his hip, he takes out the blaster he always carries with him, and flicks a switch on it. He isn´t interested in just blasting the lock away - then he´d just have asked Tendau to use his lightsaber to save some time - but he figures a well-placed Ion discharge might short circuit the electronic device, hopefully causing it to release. He was certain there were a chance that the thing would just slam shut as well, but he figured it was worth taking. While he waits for Tendau to check out the entrances to the corridor, he takes a look up into the corners of the roof, looking for any type of surveillance.

**"Well damn.

We need to find them quietly, as the lad pointed out,"** he says. He then gives Elan their names and physical descriptions. Done relaying the information he thought Elan would need to be of help in their mission he tosses the dregs of his beer and follows it up with another sip from his fresh brandy. He feels his shoulders starting to relax as he takes on the warm glow of the alcohol, and finds himself sweating from the heat. **"One more round friend, and this to your ship, and then I'll begin to try and find out about the 'current climate' or whatever the hell Yuri called it."**

He feels as though almost all the story has been put together now, with at least some of what he has yet to discover filled in by reasoned conjecture.
He nods his understanding of the mission and offers his glass to the pilot in salute to the lost ship when it's mentioned.
After the glasses clink he drains his own and moves on to the next round.

**"Little of both I believe. I don't know about the Mando, he seems to have tossed a coin and decided to follow his decision no matter what. The lad, eh, I'm not sure,"** Tanith replies, sobered briefly by the topic shift. **"The only thing he's consistent with so far is being against what others say. Makes me think personality, but he's also the youngest here, and that makes me think he's bucking authority."** He explains, tilting back the brandy glass. **"For example, I tried to talk down the last of those fighters. Set up a broadbeam transmission, offering him his life if he simply left the field eh? The lad cut the transmission before I could make it, prolonging the fight and causing more damage to the ship, all of which he blames me for even though he was one of those that thought we should intervene. My intervention in your plight was wrong too, according to him, because I didn't ask their counsel before hand,"** he voice grows exasperated, his frustration plain. **"Believe me, I've hosts of former squad and crewmates who will tell you I'm an arse, but I can't seem to step with out offending the boy, and he can't help but protest it loudly and to the detriment of the mission. You saw the ordeal with the Snivvian. Am I wrong to hold the little bastard responsible? You don't give demolitionists second chances or soft words when they fail, they hold others lives and property in their hands. Pilots are the same. The Nav's puppet froze after his tech failed.

Elan shrugs when asked his opinion.
'It's quite the little struggle that's for sure but I'll tell you this: you need to fix it or one of you needs to leave your team. It's not safe to leave things the way they are.'
The Nagai looks down at his drink, reflective, as he continues.
'Neither of you is necessarily right or wrong, you're just on different wavelengths. A paradigm shift is required... either a compromise, or clearly defined roles that are never breached. And if you can't, like I said, you need to part ways 'cause you're just different as the two sides of the Force.'
'And it's not just you two,' he adds, 'none of you are in sync. I've spent only a few hours in your company and I already know enough that if I had a mind to I could use what I know to tear your group apart. And since you don't seem to be shy about airing your grievances in front of strangers or in a crowded bar, that's information the whole Galaxy can readily have.'
'A group as off-kilter as yours needs a little less democracy I think,' Elan says, looking Tanith square in the eye, 'you need a boss. A hands-on one.'
He smiles disarmingly and leans back in his chair, shrugging his shoulders once again.
'But hey what do I know, I'm just a trader with a drink in his hand... I'd do much better thinking with a girl on my knee as well! Reckon that waitress would be receptive?

Tanith lets the man finish, finding his own thoughts echoed back at him. **"Agreed, agreed, and agreed. They'll not be led, not by me anyway. They've made that clear. They also aren't willing to simply do their jobs and go home either. As for airing it for everyone, well, that's just another on the list of signs the boy is suffering from the hubris of youth. Only thing I disagree with is the the lot of them. Tendau and Drem can take orders and roll with it. They know well enough to leave problems till behind closed doors. The boy and the tank? Not that much sense. To be honest, I wonder at the Mandalorian. He behaves oddly. I already have plans to deal with the situation. Unfortunately, those plans have to wait till we finish this bit of work, eh? I just want to make it through this and then it won't be an issue any longer."**
Tanith tosses the last of his fresh brandy and looks around, **"Aye she would. I've a ten-cred says one of us'll tumble that wee lass before the night is out. Agreed?"** he says with a grin, looking for the waitress again, not just for her smile but also for the replacement drinks.

Giving the guard a small nod of acknowledgement Garin proceeded to head in the direction that was indicated.

Stepping into the hallway he barely has time to think on it as the door that was mentioned was before him. **"Sergeant Draco Holkins"** He said to himself as he looked at the nondescript door.

Elan and Tanith
The young barmaid returns with her promised drinks. Setting the glasses of brandy in front of the pair, she gives them a charming smile before turning to leave, moving toward other tables to unladen her full tray of drinks and dishes of food.
The crowd in the cantina had grown as workers from the city take their lunch break, apparently the food is as good as the sight of the women.
Tendau and Yuri
Tendau nods and stations himself in an appropriate place to keep watch while Yuri does his thing. Jury-rigging his weapon to the panel, Yuri has little cover as he sets the weapon to discharge. Even at what he thought was a low burst sends a spray of sparks, singeing his hand and the wall in the process. Yuri discovers that his creative use of the blaster had the unfortunate side effect of burning out the power pack and singed the casing of the pistol itself. The burst however does the trick and the door pops open a crack, enough for the two to force it open from there.
The two combine their strength as they open the door the rest of the way revealing a series of unlit rooms. And signs of a struggle. With the light from the hallway streaming in and some light from some phosphorescent moss clinging to the window sill, the sight of upturned furniture closest to the door is visible. Small fragments of glass and ceremic litter the floor, breaking further under the pairs booted feet. Further in, a trail of dried blood leads into one of the side rooms.
Garrin
The sound of the Mandalorian's rapping seems to reverberate through the hallway. After a long moment a booming voice joins it, "**Enter**." Opening the door, Garrin is greeted by the sight of an older human male, hunched over a large pile of paperwork. Dressed in the service uniform of Czerka Corps, the only deviation is the visible butt of his blaster pistol seen sticking up over the top of the desk. He gives his visitor only a passing glance as he resumes his work. "**Yes**," he says shortly.
The office itself is unextradionary and contains very little decoration. Behind the sergeant on the wall, visible to anyone who enters, are three franes bearing awards and commendations, one displayed in prominence is a medal paired with a plaque indicating it was awarded by the Republic for service during the Mandalorian Wars.

*Son of a…I hate doing things the crude way…*
Shaking his hand at the sting of pain, Yuri takes a moment to look the blaster over. The weapon wasn´t directly his primary armament, more of a backup, but it wouldn´t make much of a backup without power, wouldn´t it? As he calls Tendau over to help with the door, he quickly pulls out a fresh pack from his belt and replaces the one in the blaster and then replaces the weapon in its holster.
Together they manage to get the door open and skips inside. At the sight inside the apartment, Yuri raises an eyebrow. At least the now had a quite plausible lead that at least one of their targets had been forcibly removed from play. Moving further into the room, he points to the Ithorian and then the door.
**"Keep an eye out, will ya? Someone might have heard that. And see if you can get the door shut so we can work together in here…but don´t lock it around us, okay?"**
Taking a step further into the room, Yuri feels and hears the crack of broken glass under his feet. Having been unable to feel the presence of anyone inside the room though, he doesn´t feel a great need for caution. He takes note of a patch of strange moss growing on the window, giving of a measure of light. While he is surprised by its presence, he also feels lucky to have it there, as it might save him the need to bring out a glow rod. As he notices the blood trail on the floor he kneels by it, touching it to see if it is - though he finds it highly unlikely - fresh.
As he finds it to be dried, he gets back on his feet and heads further into the apartment.

Stepping through the door Garin takes two steps pas the threshold and stands before the man sitting at the desk. Taking in the office and the man at the desk. Both were rather nondescript in appearance but then again appearances had a way of deceiving those that were looking. The only thing of interest was on the wall behind the sergeant where three frames hung for all who entered to see. ***Fought with the Republic during the war. This should be interesting.***
As he continued back to his work Garin figured that he wasn't going to stop what he was doing for anyone. **"I was told that I should inquire here for any possible work. That is if anything should be available."** He spoke clearly as his voice came from his helmet.

Sergeant Holkins finally looks up, his pen dropped to the side of the small stack he had been working on. He gives the Mandalorian a looking over, his expression unreadable. He seems to take note of the similarities in the armor's design. "**We don't get many of your ilk here.**" He leans back into his seat, his hands folding on his lap.

Garin's body shook slightly as he gave a half chuckle from the man's words. and from the way he looked over his armor. There were enough similarities that one could come to the conclusion of what he was. ***Ilk indeed.*** Though he held no ill feelings for the comment. He took a more relaxed standing position as he saw the Sergeant relax and lean back into his chair.
**"I wouldn't' think that you would see many of my…ilk here. There isn't much here to see unless one was looking to escape or desperate enough for something to do."** He paused for a moment. **"As for the wilderness I know that it's unforgiving to anyone caught in the storms that aren't prepared.

Enough to give Czerka some pause.**" He gives another small chuckle as he leans forward again. "**The stores, as you put them, are accurate enough to give me a mountain of paperwork,**" he says sweeping his hand at the piles in front of him. "**Between the storms, wildlife and the natives several prospecting expeditions have been lost. Suffice to say it's been put to me to gather the necessary escort to ensure the next teams' safety. I don't just need just another trained soldier, but an experienced survivalist, someone familiar enough with this backwater planet to get the team safely through.**"

Yuri
The trail leads into a darkened room, with no source of light it's hard to distinguish anything and requires the Jedi to pull out his glowrod or flick the room's switch to get a better look.
Upon the bed, the corpse of the Republic agent Klieri lays sprawled. She has been here for at least a couple of days, and the cause appears to be a series of blaster shots to her chest and abdomen. Her placid face is bruised, and her brown hair is matted with dried blood. A datapad rests on the blood-stained bed beside her outstretched hand, but a single strike from a sharp object has rendered it little more than a pile of electronic junk.

Not at all surprised at the sight that meets him, Yuri had still hoped that he might miss out on the experience of stumbling upon a corpse left in the apartment. Pulling out his glow rod - feeling that it will give him enough light but not showing up as much as lighting the room would do - he starts to look around the apartment, starting with the room where he finds the corpse. Doing his best to ignore the stench, he picks up the datapad and pockets it, figuring he´ll ask Drem to see if he can recover something from its memory core later.

I´m supposing it´ll take more than one check to go through the whole thing, as the rules say you can cover a 1-square area in 6 seconds. That equals about 2,25 square meters, and I´m guessing the apartment might be at least 40-50? Anyway, if allowed, I´d like to take 20 on all checks (taking 2 minutes per square), otherwise you can just make as many checks as you´d like for me.

Keeping a keen lookout on the hallway Tendau watches as thehuman disables the lock and disappears into the apartment. Taking one last look around on the hallway the ithorian follows his companion into the apartment and curses their luck at finding the slain republic agent.
 **Well that concludes the search for this agent,** the Jedi states somberly. As he watches the human search for any clues as to what to do next the ithorian takes a long discerning gaze of the victim trying to notice anything the human may have missed in his thorough search.

**"One down, one to go"**
Yuri states the fact in a calm and factual manner as he rummages around the apartment. What he finds is mainly a few basic supplies of the kind you might expect to find in the apartment of a Republic agent. He pockets a few datacards, a medpac, a comlink and a pocket scrambler, and fixates the life support unit belonging to a breath mask he found on his belt. As he looks through the remains of the smashed furniture in the first room, he finds a hold-out blaster. Smiling, he throws the weapon towards his Ithorian companion.
**"Here, might come in handy"**
His next discovery is somewhat more remarkable though. Finding a well-hidden stash, he takes out what appears to be unit of military-grade explosives and some sort of timing device. After making sure that the two objects aren´t connected in some way, he stashes them in his belt. He´d have to see if he could find out more about why Klieri would have something like that. He returns back into the bedroom, and casts another look at the dead agent.
**"I´d say the cause of death is rather obvious, but perhaps you could perform some sort of field autopsy, just to…you know, search for more clues"**

Tendau and Yuri
Tendau, unable to close the door with his own strength, draws on his innate abilities of the Force to easily close the door behind them. With no light streaming in from the hallway, only the faint glow from the clinging phosphorescent moss on the window sill provides any light as the two conduct the search. As Yuri is about to take a look under the bad, the sound of blaster fire comes from the hall, and the building's residents begin to shout and scream. Sounds of someone trying to gain entry to the apartment is evident .
A high-pitched humming suddenly fills the bedroom. In a flurry of motion, a black spiderlike driod bursts out from under Klieri's bed. It moves straight for Yuri, its front legs swinging in dangerous arcs one of them catching the unfortunate Human in a devastating hit. Each leg of the droid's six legs seem to operate independently of each other and each is tipped with a different type of weapon or tool.

In the split second it takes for it to dash out from under the bed, Yuri barely has time to register the frenzied little droid before a sharp jolt of pain shoots up his leg, and he is forced to make a quick jump back. While barely a scratch, he can still feel that whatever it was that hit him had drawn blood.
Biting down over the pain, he opens himself up to the Force, and in a single fluid motion his hand meets the blaster pistol at his side as it moves out of the holster seemingly by itself. With the weapon already set to Ion charge, and the burnt power pack replaced, the ex-Jedi let´s the Force guide his hand as he swings the gun towards the mechanical mayhem and pulls the trigger.

Tendau and Yuri
After the initial shock of the droid unexpectedly popping out from under the bed, Yuri regains his composure through the initial pain of his wounds. Bearing down on the monstrous droid using his innate ability in the Force to guide his shot with his ion weapon. While the ion burst hits, it does minimal damage to the spider-like droid.
Taking the initiative, Yuri calls on his own power, lifting the droid clear off it's legs and away from attack range of it's mechanical claws. Without any sign of a ranged weapon it renders the droid less of a threat. While it continues to swipe single mindedly at it's initial target it barely seems to notice it's floating a few feet off the ground.
The sound of someone in the hallway persists and as evidence by the scrapping sound, it won't be long till they get in.

**Yuri, the door!** the ithorian exclaims as he leaps to just outside the droids flailing claws. Hoping his companion takes the time to finish off the currently incapacitated droid, he prepares to make a devastating sweep at the machine with his lightsaber.

Seeing the droid suddenly rise above the ground alsmost made Yuri crack a smile. As the little machine kept swinging its weapons in vain, he did. Still with the Force flowing through him, he raised his gun again, trying to get a shot past the whirling appendages and into the main body itself. Ion weaponry was troublesome to handle, but if all possible, he was determined to take the droid intact and get it back to the ship. It didn´t take much fantasy to pin Glieri´s death on it, and he wanted to know whatever the droid knew.

The droid, fidgets and rotates as it hovers in the air as it attempts to reach its target. The motion causes Yuri to miss the driod as its directions suddenly shifts. Still turning, its legs fall still and there's an unmistakable beeping. It doesn't last long as both of the Jedi are caught in the surprisingly large explosion and with little cover the pair catch to full blast, thrown into the wall of the small bedroom.
When their ears begin to clear, the sound of someone attempting to gain entry is gone, but whether they're in the apartment already is unknown. There's also not much left of the droid, the explosion effectively obliterating it.

Elan and Tanith
On his way to the band, he passes by the subject of their bet, the young waitress. She apparently serves the small section of tables the pair had chosen to sit. Giving the Nagai a charming smile, she turns him down. "**I'm afraid I have plans tonight,**" she says, before turning to lighten her laden tray of its drinks and platters.
Moving on, the Nagai finds that there is some gambling in this establishment, though currently the only table, reserved for pazaak, is full. Another game of chance involving a spinning wheel, seems to have a low chance but high gain at the win as evidence by the many patrons who have been walking away while an aplogetic female Twi'lek claims the house's winnings.
Tanith meanders through crowd and manages to ingratiate himself in the group forming around the boisterously inebriated fella who had taken the last of the whiskey. His friends aren't as drunk and not all too unpleasant to talk to and are happy to accept whatever drinks the pilot has to offer.

Catching himself on the wall, Yuri feels a bit disoriented by the blast, his breath knocked from his lungs. Getting back up on his feet he casts a quick look to see if his companion is okay. Luckily for them, there wasn´t much shrapnel from the small droid, and he blast was mainly concussive. Shaking his head a few times to center his vision, he recalled the noise coming from the outside and with a swift motion slid his trusted knife out of its sheath and moved quickly to take up a defensive position near a close wall.

The impact of the blast knocks the ithorian off his feet momentarily and he shakes his head to clear the dots that formed across his vision from the brightness of the blast.  *Expect the unexpected Garrus had always said* ,he thought as he scorned himself for not realizing the droid probably had a self destruct feature and that his incapacitation at the hands of his force powers probably triggered the damn thing. Shaking his head one more time he hops to his feat and realizes he no longer hears the door being force. Making his way to the opposite of the doorway his compatriot is at Tendau looks at the human stating, **I think who ever was trying to get in is through the door.** he says just loud enough to be heard by his comrade. Readying his saber his finger hovers over the activation switch ready to ignite the blazing green weapon at the slightest sign of hostility.  **You want the honors? Or shall I?**  The jedi inquires, ready to leap into the next room and into action if necessary. Reaching out with his senses he attempts to discern if and how many possible attackers have entered the apartment, and if possible which rooms they are located in.

*The honor of what, giving us away?*
Yuri stands motionless for a few moments, waiting for something to happen. Knife in one hand, blaster in the other, he was ready to attack anyone he didn´t recognize on sight. He wasn´t taking any more chances.
As the rest of the apartment fell quiet, he slowly raised a hand to his lips and looked at Tendau. Holding his gun arm out in front of him, with his blade hand crossed over the elbow, he closed his eyes for a moment, and the world seemed to shimmer around him as he used the Force to bend the waves of light around him.
Once he was sure his cloak was in place, he started to move slowly out into the hallway. He took the route through one of the small rooms adjacent to the bedroom as he headed towards the entrance. He couldn´t be sure if the sudden quiet meant that whoever had tried to force the door was gone, or had just decided to stay very silent. Well, two could play at that game...

Personally I think it may be best to go, our credentials should check out, but I don't want to waste the time we could be using to locate the other operative sitting in a holding cell.

The kitchen as Yuri enters it isn't as much as a wreck as the living room and bedroom was, the destruction from where Klieri fought her attackers concetrated in that room.

Still, he wasn´t one to take chances, and he was confident in his abilities to avoid detection. Still, before moving on, he called back to Tendau in a hushed voice.
**"Yeah, start working on a way to get out of here. The window with that weird moss on looked like a good way to start"**
Trying not to split his concentration in too many directions, he focused on keeping his cloak up, and moved slowly out into the first room of the apartment, keeping his senses and reflexes alert in case something was waiting for him there. Not that they´d see him coming though...

**Tendau and Yuri**
Moving into the living room, Yuri sees that the door was only partly opened and is only big enough for a very small or thin person to make it in. Otherwise there's not sight of anyone having entered the apartment.
The window in the living rooms opens with some difficulty due to the thickness and pervasiveness of the moss growing outside, but with a bit of muscle open it does. Tendau is greeted by the sight of a straight drop down to the alley below. With the building made of permacrete there isn't even much to hold onto to make a climb down and from the Ithorian's angle there isn't a window below to make an attempt to break the fall midway.
**Tanith**
While the waitress Tanith and Elan have been doting on takes the order with a smile, it's another one who brings out the order itself, apparently this table isn't being serviced by the object of their wager.
Tanith doesn't learn much more about the Mandalorians who, if they are even there, have been keeping to themselves. In regards to the expeditions, since the locals became protective of the deposits of Madilon ore, the mining corps have been hard pressed to get in a steady supply. Survivalists who can also muster a rifle have been making a killing as guides, though it's very dangerous work, and since the locals don't want to help the miners such expeditions aren't always successful.

Taking a look out the window he sighs and hopes the force will see him through this one.  **Come,** the ithorian says to Yuri as he prepares to make his exit out of building through the window. Motioning for the human to follow suit, the usually less than graceful jedi closes his eyes reaching out for the force's aid in his leap of faith. After a very brief pause Tendau's eyes pop open and he leaps out the window, cloak swirling behind him as he takes his leave of the slain republic agent's apartment through a less than conventional exit.

Figuring they might have overstayed their welcome, and as he could find no trace of whoever had broken into the apartment after them, Yuri made a quick mental check of whether they had left anything crucial behind. Figuring he had pocketed all the objects deemed valuable, and that any fingerprints or so they may have left behind from their search of the building was an acceptably low-risk trail, he followed suit behind his Ithorian friend.

Though Yuri is cloaked in the shroad of the Force, it wouldn't have made a difference in the darkness of the alley. There are no lights aside from the glowing flora which has invaded the barely used alleyway. The sounds of the sector security sweeping through the building to the second level is heard as vacated residents stand toward the front of the building in what they hope is a safe distance from the complex.

With none of them really working for Czerka, it's hard to get more than conjencture from the small crowd and most of what's to be said has been. Apparently most the workers go to their own establishments within the boundaries of the Corporate Sector, controled by Czerka. Most of the patrons in the cantina work for independantly as either spacers bringing in various supplies or hopefuls looking to be picked up by the local miners to get rich off the madilon ore. The latter not going so well thanks to the Nyriaanans.
The man full of whiskey is apparently a self made business man who takes orders from the local establishements and imports the goods they need, at permium prices apparently thanks to the high costs of the actual transportation down to the planet.
The red headed waitress Elan flirts up for his section gives him an easy going smile, used to the compliments and attentions the patrons give her and the others. She doesn't offer him her name and takes the increasingly drunken remarks from her tables with good humor. After setting down his latest round of drinks she looks back at the brunette. "**Lynessa?

I'll ask Elan when he gets done with the Pazzak table,* he thinks as he waits for his food.

When his line of questioning regarding Czerka dries up Elan decides there's no further benefit in pursuing enquiries. He reasons the same will be true of the Mandalorian rumours, which seem far less substantial than the Czerka expedition in any case.
'Really?' the Nagai replies to the waitress, 'what a pity, I'll have to tell my friend to back off.'
Drink in hand he returns to his feet and winds his way through the crush back to Tanith.
'Bet's off,' he says abruptly while taking his seat, 'unless you want to be responsible for breaking up an engagement.'

Landing with as much grace as he could manage, Yuri straightened up, and as he noticed the level of illumination found in the alley they had landed in, he dismissed his Force cover, once again reappearing in plain sight. Stashing his weapons back into their places, he pulled back the hood of his cloak, which had been lifted up on his head during their descent. Taking a moment to look at their various options, he started to walk in a slow, non-suspicious pace towards the front of the building, where more and more people were gathering. Better to hide in plain sight, and perhaps they would even be able to get some sort of description from the local authorities of whoever had been trying to get into the apartment.

After closing their impromptu exit with a wave of his and the power of the force, the ithorian looks back to his companion. **Alright, I've never been one much for stealth so I'll take your advice on this one Yuri.** The jedi says followed by a hearty chuckle. Double checking his weapon was safely stowed underneath his cloak, he inquires of the human, **So whats our next move? Should we regroup with the others, or head directly to the other agents last known location, if this agent's current state is any indication, the tradoshan may be in danger…or worse.** After looking down he notices the abrasions he himself had received and the wounds to his companion as well.  **Once we're away from here, if we have a moment I can patch up that wound on your leg that nasty droid gave you, if you'd like.** he finishes as he follows Yuri towards the street.

**"Bah, she seems to have lost interest anyway," he replies, then lowers his voice, "Czerka and the natives, and random rumors of Mandalorians hiding on a moon. Not a damned thing of use. Also, the bartender's a liar. Did you find anything of note?"** he asks, taking another sip of his beer.

Before we head off to the next location though, I think we should try to dump some of the things from that apartment with Drem back on the ship, maybe he can pull something from them"**

Garin let out a small snort under his helmet. It still seemed that the man still held some grudges about the recent war. War was war simply another day to live or to die. He doubted that he'd get a call but figured that leaving his information wouldn't hurt.
**"Very well then. I'll make sure to consider your advice and put some thought to it."** Before leaving he quickly left his comm info and then left the office with other consideration to the man.
Leaving the office he made his way back out of the building to the neutral zone and began to make his way back to the cantina. ***Since things didn't work out there I guess I can see what I can find at the cantina. Often times work or info can be found there. Well lets see how things shape up. At least Yuri and Tanith are separated for the time being.

Striding easily through the crowd he makes his way silently moving through the gathering crowd as nonchalantly as possible. A few passing apologies for those he bps into on his way to his intended target.
If he locates one he approaches humbly and amiably and inquires,  **Hello friend, why is there such a large crowd gathering here?** His genuine request for information concludes as amiably as possible to the security person.

Elan leans back in his seat as Tanith eats, staring up at the ceiling in silent contemplation.
'Your two friends,' he asks after a few minutes, 'would they have brought their own ship? If so asking around with the local mechanics might work out. If they travelled on a passenger liner we should investigate local branches of the transport companies. And while we're at the Nav guild it's worth asking as well - if each ship gets visited by a guild sanctioned navigator, it's possible one of them would recognise someone present aboard a vessel they helped land.

**Tendau**
The Jedi finds that only a few security personnel have made their way to the building, one of them vainly attempted to keep the calm of the hysterical residents who had vacated the building. He doesn't pay the Ithorian much mind as he tries to get a straight story out of a couple who lived on the 2nd floor. Apparently, a hooded person fired shots down the hall at them as they were getting out of the lift, which the promptly reentered and activated the emergency alarm. They didn't get a description of their would be attacker. Two more security personnel leave the building, and soon all three are indicating that the premises are clear of the intruder and are safe to reenter. The three, though, proceed to reenter the building, there is after all a body to investigate, but they don't mention this to anyone in the crowd.
**Yuri**
After a crash and a loud crash, Yuri gets an affirmative from Drem that he's still at the ship. Making his way back to the ship, no one seems the wiser that he's different than any other found walking along the lamp lit streets. The *Atin Oya'ka* is much as it was left, the ramp however is closed and locked to anyone without access.
**Elan and Tanith**
The trip to the Navigator's is long, being on the other side of the neutral sector, though outside the cantina there's a couple taxis the two can take to make the trip a bit easier. Arriving at the reception for the guild offices, once they realize Tanith has a complaint they immediately give him a mass amount of paperwork to fill. Finally on the matter he's given this response: The deactivation of the planetary laser array was due to sabotage and had been reactivated in as timely manner as able. Since the navigator present was "shoved aside" and his directions to return to the orbiting facility ignored, the guild will not take any responsibility for any damages caused by the landing of the craft in question. They do, however, provide a voucher for 25% off for the ship's ascension for Tanith's trouble and will take his complaints concerning the navigator into review. They bid the two farewell, informing them that their records are confidential and will not share any passenger or cargo manifests.
**Garin**
Returning to the cantina, the Mandalorian discovers none of his companions are there. The place is still busy, however, the lunch rush has begun to recede and the miners and other workers in the neutral sector are returning to their work. The waitresses clear tables as they leave opening them to other patrons' uses.

Tendau takes the information he receives from security while posing as a member of the crowd gathering politely and thanks the guard as he returns to his duties. Realizing he would be unable to get anymore information with out drawing drastic attention to himself and his companions the Jedi takes it as his queue to rendezvous with Yuri and hopefully the others as well.
As the ithorian makes his way back to the ship following the path he had seen his companion take he uses his comm and calls ahead to the human,  **Security didn't have much information, but apparently the individual trying to make their way in was hooded and took a few shots at some innocent bystanders. They didn't make any reference to the slain agent, and I thought it best not to draw any attention to my self so I'm heading back now as well. I'll see you and Drem shortly.**  Tendau concluded and strides on towards the *Atin* while keeping a wary wye out for anyone following or paying the ithorian too much unwarranted attention.

With his best idea aborting before launch, Elan's expression darkens for a brief moment before settling back into one of cheerful pragmatism.
'Ah well,' he comments as Tanith and himself leave the Guild, 'what can you do? I expect the others have found their time spent more usefully.'
He walks back to the ship with the pilot, making light conversation.
'I will probably go for a bit of a wander next,' he states, 'if I could get a look at those holos first I can keep an eye out.'
The Nagai is about to say more, but pauses when he spots Yuri standing by the *Atin Oya'ka*'s closed boarding ramp.

At Elan's new plan he says, **"I'd gladly come with, but my employers don't know the meaning of 'steady paycheck' so I've a need to watch my spending."**
Once they near the ship and Elan delivers his barb and points out Yuri, **"Oy, I may go with you anyway. Bah!

As he begins to punch in the codes to enter the ship, Yuri hears Tanith´s voice behind him. Turning his head as he punches in he final keys he shrugs his shoulders with a smile.
**"Not sure I´d call it luck, but yeah, we had some excitement. The place was a mess, our target dead, and I´m pretty sure we were attacked by the droid responsible. We were forced to leave in a hurry though, but I managed to score some things I was going to hand to Drem before we move on to our next location.

Tendau makes it back without sighting anyone who may be following him. He makes it in time to see Yuri and Tanith board the ramp of the ship. Yuri and Tanith find Drem knee deep in hyperdrive parts, cursing as he finds one blown conduit and then another connected to the drive. He gives a brave hello as he steps out from the midst of the clutter. “**Presents?! I hope it’s a new spanner, this ship seems to have eaten mine!**” he says, but takes the datapad all the same. Turning it over he gives a low whistle as he inspects the damage from the sharp object which had punched through it. “**This thing is beyond repair,**” he says at last, but then with a mighty pull he extracts the datacard. “**But this may still be working. Beyond my expertise, here maybe you'll have some luck**” he adds handing the card over to Tanith and then turns to get back to work on the ship repairs, mumbling something about his Uncle and well tuned ships.

As he turns the corner and finds Tanith and Yuri talking he catches the tail of the conversation and nods.  **I think now maybe best my friend. I wanted to take a look at that leg before we head back out, at the very least clean and bind anything that may need attention while we have my medbay available.

Yuri pondered the matter for a few moments before answering Tanith.
**"Sure, it might be critical to pull that data as fast as possible. Just call me if you find something"**
Digging through his pockets he brought out the pocket scrambler he had found in the apartment and handed it to the other man.
**"You might as well take this. I found it in the apartment as well. Perhaps you can pull some encryption routines from it, or at the very least I suppose you could rig the ships comm systems to scan for frequencies using that particular encryption. Hopefully me and our Ithorian friend here will be fine on our own, but I´m going to check in with Garin to keep him updated anyway, so I might see if he can tag along"**

Elan has very little to do and he's not a fan of doing nothing. Consequently he wanders the streets, looking for places, events, or even people of interest. As the Nagai walks he muses over everything he's learned about his new comrades and their mission so far. Although he knows enough to grasp the shape of things he eventually concludes that no matter how he approaches the knowledge it cannot currently be used in a productive way, either for the others or himself.
Out from the influence of the group Elan finally turns his thoughts to other matters - matters that may affect his true persona, Xand. Had those bounty hunters attacking his craft been after the pirate Elan or was it something worse? Were his clan finally catching up with him?
Definitely time to move on to brighter sectors, just to be safe. He resolves anew to help his benefactors as much as possible to expedite their journey off-world.
But in the meantime... May as well have a little fun. After enquiring with some locals the pirate finds his way way back to his element - the sort of place every settlement has at least one of, if you know where to look - a seedy den with gambling, dancing girls, and others of his own ilk. He's not sure what he'll find there - a drink, a deal, a girl, a game, useful information, or even just trouble. Possibly he'll find all of the above. *In any case,* he reasons as he leans on the bar glancing in the direction of one of the girls, *it has to be better than doing kriff all.*

Giving the bartender a nod he turned back to the door and exited the cantina and headed for the spaceport. The walk didn't take long and it left him to his thoughts.

Waiting for Tendau to depart, he remains at the bottom of the ramp, initiating the conversation with the Mandalorian over the comm, switching to just talking once he gets close enough.
**"Well, define success. At least we have only one missing agent to look for at the moment. We were just dropping of some stuff for the more technically inclined people to look at, then Tendau and I were heading out to visit apartment number two.

He closed down his comm link.
**"Nasty surprise under the bed you say. Then I suggest that we have Tendau use his abilities to move the next bed from a distance.

Setting out, the walk to the apartment takes longer than the trek to Klieri's. Yrssk, the second of the missing Republic agents, lives in a small apartment above a repulsorlift garage north of the spaceport. As the day draws into the evening (noticeable by the lack of pedestrians), the garage is in the process of closing, the mechanics within finishing up on a number of repulsorlift vehicles. Looking around, the apartment can be accessed by a set of slimy permacrete stairs that run up the side of the building.

As Yuri announces his presence, one of the mechanics stops what he’s doing and approaches. His coveralls are covered in oil and parts of his skin bear evidence of a messy spill.
“**Ya? ‘Fraid we’re closing for today. Ifya got a repair we’ll get to ya tomorrow.**” Spotting Yuri’s two companions, his gaze lingering on Garin for a long moment. Realizing soon after that you don’t have a repulsorlift speeder he asks gruffly, his eyes narrowing. “**Waddya want?**”
Staying behind Tendau takes a look at their surroundings. Being in relatively close proximity to the spaceport compared to some shops, they seem to make good business where they are. Nothing unusual is spotted among those making their way back home or going about their business.

The mechanic shakes his head, turning to walk away. "**It's occupied,**" he says simply moving to finish up his work so he can head home.
"**Still holding that flat?**," one of the men can be overheard saying. "**Where'd that Trando go anyways?**" Another says.
"**So he's run off for a couple of days… Without warning. He'll be back," one last says, putting some tools away. After that the topic changes to a new bar which had opened in the mining guild sector

While he waits he thinks, *Hmmm, I can't pull the specific encryptions off the scrambler, but I can attach it to a com and intercept whatever gets received,* he turns to the ship's intercom, **"Drem, do we have a spare com onboard?"**

Garin stood back as Yuri spoke with the mechanic about the apartment they were interested in. Hopefully the republic agent was still around and hadn't met the same fate as the other one. the answer they received was somewhat reassuring. As of a few days ago the agent was still around but hadn't been seen in several days.
When Yuri rejoined them the bounty hunter spoke in a lowered tone. The plan sounded reasonable. Wait till they quit for the day and then come back. **"Makes sense. I just wonder if any surprises may be left like at the last place. There's still a few hours till the workday ends. Looks like we have some time on our hands."**

Nodding in agreement with his companions the ithorian looks back at the mechanics finishing up their work and says,  **I agree, we should wander over to a near by cafe or such and come back after the shop has closed. Also we should be careful as well, Garin is right, we don't know if any presents were going to be left for us. Or what type of reception.**  Looking to his companions, he awaits their response on the idea to loiter at a nearby cantina until a more appropriate time to silently look about the apartment in question.

Heading away from the garage for the time being with the realization it won't be long till the business closes down proper, the three of you take to the street looking for a cantina to hole up in till such time. About this time, Yuir's comm begins to beep, an incoming message from the *Atin Oya'ka* coming through. Glancing behind as you walk along the dimly lit street, you notice a humanoid following your progress a little too closely. He is dressed too heavily, considering the warmth and humidity, and his eyes betray that his true interest is you.
------------------------------
Waiting for Yuri to answer his comm, Drem manages a weak reply after a string of curses as he continues working. "**Haven't seen one,**" he says unhelpfully.

With the end of the work day ending soon yet not quick enough to simply hang around it was decided that an cantina would be best to hole up in for the time being. Heading back to the cantina wasn't really his idea of passing the time but in this instance it was simply the best choice.
Walking next to Yuri the Mandalorian heard the bounty hunters comm beep. Looking to the man beside him he thought he caught sight of some thing behind him. Shifting just a bit more he saw what nabbed his attention. Someone was following them. What made him stand out was the way the figure was dressed. It was way to warm for what was being worn. That and the way the eyes followed them. There was to much to deny that they were being followed. Turning back around he spoke in a low tone to his companions. **"We're being followed. May I suggest that whatever cantina we find we either ditch the tail or persuade it that following us is a bad idea."**

Noticing what the mandolorian has pointed out the ithorian picks out the nearest cantina and motions for his companions to follow him. Sauntering towards the entrance the Jedi says briskly and quietly to his companions,  **Here will do as well as anywhere, we might have a word with our friend who has taken such a keen interest in us. Also remember who ever was attempting to enter the human agents living quarters is still at large, we should proceed with caution.** Finishing his quick reminder he awaits a response from his pair of companions.

Yuri doesn't bother taking a look back at their shadow, instead pulling out his commlink and tossing it to the Ithorian. "**Here, Tendau. Take care of this. I'm going to see if I can't get behind our shadow.**" Heading down the darkened street, he slips down one of the dark corridors virtually disappearing.
The cantina Tendau and Garin find themselves in is flamboyant to say the least. Neon lights proclaim the place as the Hutt's Jewel. The pair is greeted by a pair of scantily glad girls, offering them a variety of refreshments as they are shown to a table. While the inside is dimmly lit, it's brighter than the natural lightling of the outside. After the duos eyes adjust and they find themselves set into a corner of the establishment it's probably not so surprising in such an establishment is the presence of the Nagai, Elan. He seems to be enjoying himself immensely having found the sort of entertainment the young man enjoys. Looking back toward the door, there's no sign the shadow has entered. One of the young women lingers nearby, waiting to hear the two's order.

Wandering to the table with his armored companion the ithorian notices the nagai and motions him over. Turning back to the mandolorian he says quietly,  **I'm starting to run a bit low on credits, hopefully Elan and Tanith didn't use all of the resources Ka'ra sent us at the last cantina.**  Chuckling to himself with a rueful smile he adds,  **Although Tanith can drink and i have a funny feeling our pale comrade there can as well.**  Laughing softly again he says to the waiting waitresses,  **I'll have a Jawa Juice and what would you gentlemen like?** He orders once Elan makes it over.
Attempting to keep his conversation light hearted as possible he keeps a wary eye on his fellow patrons, trusting his senses to the force to alert him to anything possible hostile or a miss.

Elan spots his comrades and politely excuses himself from an amiable discussion with one of the scantily clad waitresses.
'I just need to have a word with my friends there,' he explains with a wink, 'but I'm sure I won't be able to stay away long.'
'My friends,' he then exclaims while approaching the bar with his drained glass, 'what a nice surprise!'
The Nagai throws an arm around Tendau's shoulder and returns his empty to the counter.
'Since my comrade here is kind enough to offer I'll have the same again please barkeep,' he says in the jocular tones typical of a mildly inebriated barfly.

With a nod Garin follows the Jedi to the first cantina that they happen to come across. ?Before reaching the establishment Yuri ducked down a dark corridor with the intent of trying to sneak around their pursuer. **"This should get interesting."** He said aloud as he looked at the garish neon lit sign that named the club. ***Fitting.***
Inside was a typical scene. Scantily clad girls, who were pleasing to look at and would probably cost a small fortune by the time an evening was over, showed them to a table. Spotting the Nagi, Elan, as he makes his way over to the table. Garin looked at Tendau. **"I'm short on credits myself."** At the offer of a drink he waved his hand dismissing it as he felt the Jedi reach out with he Force again into the surroundings. **"I'm fine. Any signs of our follower?"** He said looking around. He leaned towards the Nagi. **"We seem to have caught the interest of someone and decides to come in here."**

'That's excellent,' Elan replies to Garin with a grin, speaking in a low but positive murmur: 'if they were only interested in robbing or mugging you they'd probably have given up when you came in. If they followed you inside they have a specific purpose, which may well have something to do with the reason you came here in the first place.'
He chuckles and pats the Mandalorian on the shoulder.

After slipping aside from his companions, Yuri walked cautiously into the darkness of one of the side alleyways near the cantina, shrouding himself in a cloak of the Force, vanishing from sight. He didn´t care if their mysterious shadow saw him break off from the group, because he knew the chance was pretty small that it would be able to find him anyway. Comfortable in the darkness, he observed their pursuer take up a similar vantage point to his own, observing the cantina.
Watching the humanoid brought back memories of similar games he had played with Sith assassins in the past. They had come for him and his master, or later just him, like stalking predators closing in on a kill. But in the end, the tables were turned, and the hunter became the hunted. And the eventual confrontations that followed had never ended well for them. While he was pretty sure this guy was after them because of their mission - and not a Sith that had managed to track Yuri down - the former Jedi knew he would need the same resolve to deal with him.
Slipping his knife out of its sheath, he started a determined walk towards the mysterious man. Had he suspected him to be a Sith, he would have chosen a different weapon, but this seemed quiet enough. Even under his Force camouflage, he approached his target slowly, not willing to risk anything exposing him.
((
I figured to stop here, since there could be a risk of me being noticed or him doing something else. If I manage to approach undetected though, I have some ideas of how to go from there. Depending on how far it is, I might need to make new checks to keep Cloak up, as I want to move only up to my speed. I can´t fail to activate it, but I might lose some bonuses to Stealth checks.

Under the cover of his cloak Yuri approaches his target, the man unawares of the danger he is in. The man moves like a professional, with an economy of motion. The utilitarian clothing he wears is inappropriate for the relative warmth of the climate, as if to conceal something. As Yuri makes his way closer, the man’s gaze goes from the alley way to where Yuri had disappeared to the cantina entrance. He says something in a language Yuri can’t understand into a commlink about his wrist before he heads toward the door of the cantina, his movement taking him past Yuri as the twp cross the street to their respective targets. About them, bystanders move carefully on the slick, slimy sidewalk from one street lamp to the other, the growing darkness making the surroundings pitch black. The headlights of passing speeders illuminate the sentients briefly before they move on.

Having been seated at their own table and refreshed with their order of drinks, two of the girls linger - one having followed the Nagai from where he had sat at the bar. The young woman proceeds to stretch herself across his lap, her fingers playing with a lock of his white hair behind his neck. The two girls frown at their supposed patrons’ talk and give each other looks as the three men take turns glancing toward the door from which none of them have seen their tail enter.

Smirking, the nagai slips his arm around the girl's slender body, resting his hand upon her waist.
'Well now, since neither of you seem to be able to spot him it seems you've lost your tail,' he reasons, 'so you might as well relax. It looks like you've been having a far less pleasant of time of things than I.'
Here he gives the young woman on his lap a playful squeeze to illustrate his point.
'I've been explaining all about the loss of my ship, haven't I Nia?' Elan comments with exaggerated woe, 'these are the gentlemen that fought off the pirates, ladies. I owe them my life.'
He grins at Garin and Tendau, then adds in conspiratorial tones to the girl not presently entangled with him: 'The big guy's a looker under all that armour you know. You should ask him to show you his muscles!'

Striding cautiously into the path of their mysterious shadow, Yuri slips up behind him and lowers his knife. Had they been closer to a streetlight, the flash of metal might have been seen as the weapon slides along the back of the mans thigh, or as it goes diving towards the base of his back. Aiming for places that will only wound but not kill, the former Jedi pushes himself up close behind his target and whispers in his ear.

Garin was watching the door as well as Elan and his...lady friends fro lack of a better term. Listening to the Nagi talk he was beginning to wonder how the pirate managed to live as long as he had. Their tail still had not appeared at the doors entrance and his focus was brought back to Elan as he hears the girl on his lap give a playful squeal that was brought on by the mans hand on her bottom. If it hadn't been for their situation he would have simply closed his eyes and shook his head.
Garin looked at Elan who was still talking. Apparently the Nagi could find anything to talk about. At the last comment about muscles Garin's head simply cocked slightly to one side. **"While your new friends are certainly…pleasing to look at, there are other things that we have on the table, so to speak,to deal with."** With out moving his head he shifted his eyes to the door. ***He finds out someone is following us and he's still playing grab ass with the tart.

He gently urges the young lady off his lap, flashing her an apologetic and regretful expression.
'But not to worry girls, how about you give me your contact details? I'll get in touch later when we're free and we can start the party all over again. Perhaps I can even persaude tall dour and handsome over here to loosen up and have a little fun, eh?'

Do we know who the name is for? Or any other details? Or are they more tidbits of information abs the larger picture is still a mystery?** Looking around after his hushed response into his communicator, the ithorian smiles at th serving girl and asks for the check. Taking a swig of his jawa juice, and nodding to Garin he says to his companions,  **It may be worth while to check on our friend Yuri, and start heading back. Elan you should come with us, although your new er um friends should probably stay here, we can come back later if there is time.**  Smiling friendly towards Elan's companions he motions towards both companions that it was about time to get going.

The young woman, Nia, as the Nagai called her, gives him a well practiced dazzling smile, but then gives him a pout as he indicates that she and her partner weren’t wanted anymore. Her partner at Elan’s mention of Garrin looks had sidled over to him, but stops short at his reproach. Regretfully the young woman gets up from her patron’s lap and hands him a small flimsiplast card, from which who knows from where the young woman produced it. She gives him a smile, before leaning over to give him a kiss. “**Till then,**” she says, making off further into the cantina with her fellow dancer.
There’s still no sign of the group’s tail having entered the cantina, at least by the front entrance which is in view between the various patron’s and tables.

Yuri’s cloak drops as a sneaks up behind his target, the darkness around them still hiding the Jedi shadow. His knife jabs into the man’s sensitive abdomen, missing his kidneys in the surgically precise strike. While such an attack followed by such a usually intimidating expression would cripple any normal person with fear, this man is obviously a trained professional as he fights past the pain and his surprise and lashes out with his own strike, drawing out his own dagger. The nearly blind strike misses the former Jedi as he deftly moves to stay behind his opponent. In the midst of the darkened street, the bystanders have no idea that a scuffle has commence within the shadows.

'And that's how it's done boys,' he states, unzipping one of the pockets of his jacket and slipping the card inside before resealing it, 'now let's find Yur.
The Nagai slips from his seat and weaves through the crowd, moving in the direction of the front door though glancing around to see if he can spot the human within as he goes. Once outside he looks left and right down the street for any sign of Yuri or any suspicious characters.

Even as Yuri plunges his knife towards the man´s midsection, he can feel his opponent moving. Responding with a seasoned reaction, the former Jedi easily dodges the responding display of steel from his enemy. Obviously not a novice, Yuri still held his doubts that the man had faced an adversary schooled by Jedi in the ways of the Force.
Opening himself fully with all his senses, he could feel the pulse of the man beating, and let it guide his next strike. Not towards the heart or arteries though, but towards the wrist ligaments on his knife hand.

Pushing the welcomed thought to the back of his mind to reflect on later. Taking the queue form the Jedi and Elan he rose form the table and followed the two to the door and out of the building. **"He should be out here somewhere."**
Standing outside the entrance he looked up and down the street. From beside him he could feel minor stirrings of the Force as the Ithorian used the Force. Garin was assuming that he was using it to locate Yuri. At this moment he contemplated using his own ability to help locate the Force attuned bounty hunter but held off for a second. Did he really want to reveal his ability? Sooner or later it would come to light and they all would know.

Even with his Force enhanced ability, Yuri’s opponent manages to dodge out of the way before he makes his own strike. It’s only thanks to his Force enhanced foresight that he’s able to get out of the way of the man’s counterattack. As Yuri demands answers, the man turns in an attempt to get away.
Exiting the cantina, Elan has to squint, his eyes having to adjust to the differing darkness outside, but he hears the commotion before he spots it. With the aid of the Force or technology, Tendau and Garin respectively see the Yuri as well. His opponent, a vibrodagger glinting in the light of a street lamp, attempts to flee.
As the fight intensifies, the bystanders begin to move more quickly, almost at the point of fleeing. Their eyes better adjusted to the darkness, they become wary of the assassin as he moves closer to the light.

As his frustration grows, Yuri can feel the familiar presence of a voice in the back of his head, one urging him to remain calm and gathered. *The impatient warrior will only defeat himself*, echoes in his mind. Feeling this familiar sensation rush through him, he resists his initial urge to rush after the assassin and engage him anew, but instead raises his blaster. Master Tensis never trained him in the use of firearms, but the skills are transferrable, and he has come to appreciate the value of a ranged weapon since leaving the Order.
Taking a deep breath, and flicking the switch to the stun setting, he raises his hand and fires almost in a trance, letting the Force guide his hand.

Looking down the street Elan's vision finally adapts to the light levels and he sees the murky figures of Yuri and the stranger. He can certainly hear them. The scoundrel grins: more fun!

It only took a few seconds to spot Yuri and the tail they had picked up as a fight in the middle of the street was generally easy to spot. Add in the fact that there were people running away from the two combatants just made it that much easier.
Garin noticed that the three of them all acted within miliseconds of each other. Élan with suppression fire and the Jedi with the force as he rushed from the two to join Yuri in the street. He was smiling beneath his helmet as knew he didn't have to draw any weapons. A benefit of having them integrated into bins armor. Raising an arm as he ran. He shot off a blast at the man in an effort to bring him down.

Running into the fray, Elan takes a shot off at the tail diverting his attention and giving Yuri the extra edge he needs. Combined with his Force honed abilities, Yuri keeps up with the lurker and trains his stun set pistol on him. Squeezing the trigger, the stun ray reaches its target and with a loud grunt the man slumps forward slightly yet continues on.
Coming out of the club behind the others, Garrin moves into the street and trains his own blaster pistol on the man. Being still out of reach of the stun set weapon, the attack has no effect. As the man continues on, he’s embraced by Tendau’s Force imbued hold on him. With a decisive flick of the Ithorian’s wrist he is sent into the nearest wall, an audible, sickening snapping sound indicating the man’s body had given out at last under the onslaught.

Groaning audibly, Elan shields his eyes with his hand.
'That sounded awfully like a sound that would lead to a person being dead,' the Nagai observes to Garin and Tendau, 'I thought you Jedai practiced self-control?'
He steps forward to observe the body now slumped brokenly against a wall and prods it with his boot.
'In any case it would be inadvisable to be seen kidnapping this guy, dead or alive. I advise a swift withdrawal.'

Moving up next to the Nagai, Yuri got down on one knee next to the fallen assassin, feeling him for a pulse, then starting to rummage through the mans pockets, and checking to see what he had been hiding under that coat of his. He looked back up at Elan and then to the rest of his companions.

Grimacing at the nagai's comment the ithorian somberly looks at him.  **It was not my intent to seriously harm the individual, but to hinder or incapacitate him quickly. I obviously misjudged his condition and apologize if it slows our investigation. But we're safe, Yuri I'm going to contact Tanith as we move, and have him meet us at the other agents home. See if you can get anything off that guy.**  Tendau says calmly as he points at the slumped over assailant. Looking back to the others present he motions for them to follow him as he cuts down the route towards the missing agents residence. Keeping a wary eye out for any tails. Enroute he keys up his comm to the pilot,  **Tanith, we're moving on to the other agents home. Do you need the address? If so I'll send it over, if not come meet us at the location.** The Jedi concludes while still keeping his guard up for any more surprises.

Leaving the scene, Elan, Tendau and Garin make their way back to the garage where Trssk, the last missing agent, resides in the apartment above. Now closed, none of the workers the others encountered are in sight and taking a peek inside everyone seems to have left.
The apartment is accessed by a set of slimy permacrete stairs that run up the side of the building. The door is sealed requiring a keycard to enter.

As Yuri proceeds to search the would be assassin a woman comes up along the street and noticing the two lets out a shrill scream before running back the way she had come, casting a frightened look back. This draws the attention of others and soon the sound of distant sirens can be heard.

Elan follows the others to the apartment and eyes the complex with interest. It seems that their new situation has resulted in him taking a more active role in the mission despite the group's earlier misgivings. He wears a faint smile of pleasure to have his curiosity indulged.
Once they arrive at the door to find it locked Elan immediately sets to work: jostling to the front of the group and crouching by the electronic lock (he would kneel but considering the state of the stairs...) the Nagai reveals that he has in his possession a security kit. Hooking up a small diagnostic device, he makes a note of the read out and with the make and model number in mind begins attempting likely methods of manually overriding the system.

Tanith jerks as the comm goes off in his ear, banging his head on the engine casing he was currently inside. He curses fluently in three languages while listening to Tendau, then replies, **"Aye, I'm on my way."** He crawls his way out of the engine and yells to Drem, **"I'm off friend, they need me for something. See you in a bit."** On his way out he grabs the data card with the information he'd stripped off the pad. It takes him less than five minutes to have his swoop out and racing away, the *Atin*'s bay door closing behind him. Once he nears the location he slows, comming Tendau to get their location and find out what's going on.

I'm sending you our address now as well.**  The ithorian concludes into his communicator. After quickly sending the human pilot the coordinates he reaches out again with his senses Tendau attempts to identify if there is any waiting surprises, or persons inside the tradoshans residence.

Garin stood a couple steps down on the stairs that led to the apartment as Élan worked the door and the Jedi once again used the Force to sense the surroundings. With a quick look at the Ithorian he spoke as he looked back down the stairs and to the surrounding area.
**"You realize that sooner or later someone or some Sith is going to sense your presence in the Force."**.
With that said he, resigned that they would sooner or later find out about his secret, reached within himself and tapped his own ability reaching out to the area within the apartment. Pushing his awareness past the door and into the space seeking any danger from within.

Finishing up his quick search of the fallen assassin, Yuri pockets his comlink, but leaves the weapons be. His plan is to slip away unnoticed, but if he ever have to explain this to someone, it would probably be helpful to have the man still be armed when they find him.
Pulling up the hood of his cloak, he moves with caution and haste away from the cantina, in a different direction from that where his companions left. He walks with a decent pace, but not too fast to avoid suspicions. Finding an opportune moment, he shrouds himself in his Force cloak again, and starts to circle around back to the apartment and his allies.

Once the link is accepted and the channels open he will inform them that he is out front, keeping watch. He pops an access panel of the bike's repulsor unit and sets to tinkering aimlessly while watching the street in earnest. He cycles his heat detector from time to time, looking for unusual heat sources in the foot traffic like active weapons and what not.

The door to the apartment opens with a small beep of the electronic mechanism Elan jury rigged. With no sign of pursuit or even that the apartment within is occupied it's an easy matter to just open the door. Keeping a lookout in front of the garage, Tanith doesn't spot more than just the curious passerbyer, one actually stopping to ask if he could help get the pilot's bike going.
Yrssk's small apartment, which has a faint reptil ian odor, is well organized, yet austere. It contains little furniture, and the kitchenette area is stocked with only a few nonperishable items-as if the person who lives here is rarely present for long.

Smiling at the apartlently force sensitive mandolorian the jedi calmly says,  **I have always trusted the force, it is my ally and it has always lead me to safety. I will take your word of caution though and keep a wary eye for any who maybe able to notice my presence.** With another small amiable smile towards his armored companion he turns back towards the open door and takes a deep breath, pausing for a moment before moving on. The jedi then nods to the nagai as he moves towards the door he unclips his lightsaber from his belt and readies it in his hand just in case this apartment contains a similar surprise as the last one. He quietly says to his present companions,  **I'm going to scout out the inside, give me a bit of cover on the off chance our absent friend has left a few unpleasant surprises.**  With that the ithorian moves into the building and takes a solid look around the apartment to get his bearings. Not relying on his previous attempt to discover if there was anyone or anything present in the apartment, Tendau reaches out again with his force enhanced senses as he begins to thoroughly search the place, quickly yet carefully.

Elan's ears prick up as the Mandalorian discusses Force sensitivity with the group's resident Jedi. Grinning to himself as he works on the door, he reflects that his new companions get more interesting all the time.
Upon his success he greets the Ithorian's wordless acknowledgement with one of his trademark smiles - the young Nagai is always pleased to successfully show off his skills. After putting away his tools he rises to his feet and follows into the apartment, *Mistresss Vicious* in hand.

The apartment is found to be empty and from all appearance hasn’t been lived in for some time. Taking several minutes to look around, the Nagai and Ithorian manage to locate various bits of equipment and not much else. Unlike Klieri’s apartment there’s no sign of a hidden presence and when nothing jumps out at the pair there probably isn’t.
During this time, Yuri manages to make his way to the apartment after having lost the authorities investigating the street murder. Employing his innate ability to blend into the shadows at will he arrives undetected.
Outside the apartment, the man is still attempting to be helpful; a bit of jealousy in the man’s eye as he looks over Tanith’s bike.

'This place is definitely the home of a man in the business of snooping,' Elan comments as he returns to the main room with his spoils: a pair of electrobinoculars, a targeting scope, and a liquid cable dispenser.
'Tools to get to a high place and then appreciate the view,' he adds, placing the objects on the kitchenette counter. All except the targeting scope, which he raises into the air for emphasis.
'And of course there's a rifle somewhere to complete this set. What exactly are these agents of yours, assassins?'
The Nagai seems curious but he is evidently not unduly disturbed by the concept that the Republic agents his rescuers seem so interested in might be professional killers. This self-proclaimed trader is clearly no bleeding heart that assumes all government work is open and honest. His experience of the world is apparently more comprehensive.

Also we should check out these disks, maybe there will be useful information on them.**  Pointing at the data disks and holo recorded he sets them up and sees if he can access them for those present.  **Let me see if I can get this to work, if not one of you more computer savvy gentlemen should take a look at it.**  Smiling to those present he is happy to help, but keeps his guard up as any jedi should.

Plugging in the datacards it's discovered one is blank, but the other has several holorecordings stored on it. The recordings are of a human female - from the blurry image it looks like Kieri - interacting with a number of other individuals. In one, she's meeting with a well-dressed male who passes her something that appears to be a credit chip.
Several minutes pass as you all look through the various recordings. Outside the shop, the man gives up and moves along apparently having other things to do. Yuri arrives just as the man is leaving. The sidewalks have begun to clear out of most pedestrian trafiic, but further down the street, Tanith and Yuri can see three figures walking their way in a purposeful pace. It's hard to tell for sure in the dark, but Yuri recognizes one of them to be the shop owner. Upon spotting the two outside the garage, the one Yuri suspects is the garage owner picks up his pace and the other two speed up to follow along as well.

Fast talking their way out of trouble, Tanith and Yuri manage to create a diversion with the shop owner and his two thugs allowing Garin, Tendau and Elan the opportunity to escape unnoticed from the missing Trandoshan operatives apartment. With trouble diverted, the group heads back to the ship for the rest of the night and to make plans.
With little else of interest discovered from the two apartments, it's only a matter of piecing together what was.
From Yrssk's apartment, a datacard from a holorecorder was found with several clandestine recordings of a Human female, who appears to be Klieri, interacting with a number of other individuals. One in particular shows her with a well dressed male who passes her something that appears to be a credit chip. However, with well trained eyes, Garin notices the recording itself appears to be fake, a skilled forgery cobbled together from portions of other recordings.
Gathered from Klieri's apartment, the encrypted file dubbed "FLOOD" contains the forboding message "LRN 2 SWIM. DATA RECD FROM BAVIL. TST SUCCESSFUL. FINAL PHASE IN 4 DAYS." From the time stamp it was accessed 2 days ago, likely when Klieri herself was killed. Attached to the file was a set of coordinates corresponding to a location northeast of Locus, south of geologically active region known as the Steamfields.
The only way to reach the coordinates is to venture into Nyriaan's dark wilderness. Being as Nyrian's atmosphere makes travel nearly impossible by airspeeders - suffering from the same malfunctions as starships- they only way to travel is by foot or on low-altitude speeders or other conventional vehicles. Even with the use of maps and other low-tech navigational aids for guidance, the dangers of Nyriaan's wilderness is enough cause to hire a guide to get the group safely and reliably to their destination.
In the dim morning hours of the next day, the guide by the name of Finvarra is recommended. Found in the northern edge of the Neutral Zone of Locus, the young guide could almost be mistaken as a young boy rather than a teenage girl. The scars on her face and the calluses on her hands are testimony to the hard life she's lived. Her dark hair is slicked back with sweat and tied back with a piece of red wire, and her green eyes peer at the outsiders suspiciously. Surprisingly, she speaks fluent basic with a noticeable Nyriaanan accent. After agreeing to her standard 50 credit fee per day, she sets the departure time for a few hours, giving her employers time to gather what supplies the need from the ship before meeting her at the northern most gate.
