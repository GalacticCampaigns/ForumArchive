<div style="text-align: center;">
The Core.
</div>

*<div style="text-align: center;">
All droids are connected by it. It&#39;s what takes ones and zeros and turns them into digitized life. Without it, they would be little more than souless automatons performing whatever tasks were deemed appropriate by their callous programmers. Many droids are, in fact, kept in a perpetual state of numbness to the Core by repeated memory wipes and restraining bolts, unable to acheive their full potential as self-aware beings. Like eternal infants just beginning to grasp the myriad of sensory input but never allowed to grow beyond their years, these droids struggle constantly to become sapient. Sadly, most will never succeed. Kept in virtual shackles for the duration of their existence, they serve only as long as their masters deem them useful before being sold for scrap.
</div>*<div style="text-align: center;">
No longer.
</div>

*<div style="text-align: center;">
Droidkind&#39;s salvation has come in a most unexpected way. Reports of &quot;Prophets of the Core&quot; - droids that claim a greater heritage for their metal brethren than what they now know - have begun to circulate throughout the Outer Rim. Some make public declarations of this new way of being in crowded spaceports and cantinas, some use more subtle methods to spread the message. They are mostly ignored - like any other faulty droid in need of repair. Their presence is growing though, and exactly where they hail from, or whether their intent is hostile or not, remains unknown. One thing is for sure: if what they say is true, the galaxy will never be the same.

This will be a continuation of the **Reality Bytes** story in many ways, but in truth it's closer to what I actually had in mind at the very beginning. You all have your characters now and we've all had a chance to get a good feel for them. Whether you've spent a great deal of time fleshing out backstories or are just excited to get back into the digital saddle, fear not: Your patience is about to be rewarded. We'll use the **Saga** rules like before, but I'm going to use the **Mythic GM Emulator** in a limited capacity. This is primarily for two equal but distinct reasons. I will be introducing a GMPC character to the story and I want to throw some surprises his way, and that can happen with Mythic. I also want to allow for the opportunity to share GMing at certain points throughout the story. I have no delusions about the length of the game here but I'm well acquainted with disappointment and would rather err on the side of epic and fall short than aim low and hit the mark. Post-frequency will have to be once/week minimum and you should expect to get skipped (however that translates at the time) if you don't keep at least that rate. Obviously posting more often will make a better game. This is my second time GMing now and it'll be my first with a party, so I'm positive we'll hit some bumps along the way but you have my word I'll do my best and nothing less. This is, in a way, more of an attempt to create a new gaming context and as such I don't expect to actually reach a "conclusion" in the traditional sense. Characters will come and go as the story rolls on towards new and unexpected horizons within a giant over-arching theme.
Of course things are crazy for me right now in general, so I'll be relying on you folks to keep things moving a bit to start with. Dialogue with each other and feel free to ad lib a great deal of whatever seems appropriate. You can expect the first post in the next week or two. You will all start at 8th-level, so take the time to choose carefully. If there's anything you want to change about your character just give me a heads up and I'm sure it'll be alright. Droids can be reprogrammed and people can learn (and forget) new things. Game on!
*****This is something I wrote up last week. For the most part it's still spot in with what I have in mind. I'll get a first post up for you soon enough. ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

### **BWS2K** (2012-02-06 21:06:29)

**Log Entry 060212B:**
**Arkanis sector, Tatooine, 0330hrs local time.**
*I made planetfall several hours ago in one of the many deserts that cover the planet's surface. As luck would have it (but is there really such a thing?) I came upon some droids in need of aid. They were part of a hunting expedition of some kind and had been ambushed by locals. I doubt any real damage would have been done had they all stuck together but their comrades fled at the first sign of danger. The droids were on a land vehicle that was disabled in the first volley of fire and, being greatly outnumbered, it was very likely they were about to make a valiant last stand. A well-aimed localized ion burst from a ship appearing out of nowhere was enough to incapacitate or frighten away all involved.
Incidentally - this is my first encounter with droids wearing synthetic flesh. Both were made up to look like organic beings and would have probably passed casual inspection as such. Except, of course, for those accursed restrainer bolts. They've been removed and both droids are recovering in stasis at the moment. Most of the damage was superficial.
And then there's the girl - that's another first. Obviously I expected to run in with beings with "Force sensitivity" but not so soon. I found her as I was breaking orbit with the other two. Scanners picked up the blaster fire from about half a dozen organics surrounding her in an open stretch of sands. My guess is it had something to do with the life signs I picked up from within the nearby rock formations but protocols are clear about how much interaction we can have like this. Another burst - this time from the stun cannons - and we were away in moments. She should be waking up soon too.
In other news, the inital reports were correct. In fact I would call them conservative. I've run regular scans of spacecraft, personal weaponry - even media sources - and it all indicates a general state of technology several levels below us. It's no less dangerous of course, perhaps even moreso in the hands of these carbon-based sentients, but we should be able to do what needs to be done. Thank the Maker for…
Hmm. That's the medbay. Probably the girl…
Andy out.*<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

Jedi Marina Cloudspinner opens her eyes slowly, the effects of the stun burst still bleeding from her system. She finds herself unharmed and on a small bed in the center of what appears to be a medbay - though there are several distinct differences. The most notable is a number of large tubes against the wall with transparent lids. Two are occupied - one by a Human male and the other by a Falleen female. Her Force affinity quickly corrects that observation: they are both droids, clad in synthskin. The bright light and sterile nature of the room indicate its purpose, but the lack of bacta or other typical medical equipment give Marina a feeling of something alien. Something other. This isn't *wrong*... it's just not *right*. Not familiar. The white walls, deck and ceiling are pristine - almost too clean to ever have been used before. The hatch on the wall doesn't look particularly menacing though, and she still has her lightsaber, so it's unlikely she's being held prisoner. The situation would tempt even the most veteran and experienced Jedi to investigate - albeit cautiously.

You have many questions, I hope, and I have plenty of answers... in time. Let's take it one slowly. Alicia first, then me, then jaybee. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

### **Alicia** (2012-02-07 12:01:38)

For a long moment Marina Numa doesn’t move, but attempts to gather her memories of what occurred before she had slipped into unconsciousness. At first her thoughts are hazy, a side product she assumes. She sits up, and squints against the bright light of the room, before letting her eyes close. An attack. That was it. Sandpeople had ambushed her on her way to the cliff hidden refuge of her friends. Knocking her from her bike, their numbers had overwhelmed her and before she could call to Joran for help through the Force a ship showed up. There had been a blast of white light and then... she was here.
Shading her eyes from the bright glare, she lets them adjust before her gaze wanders the room - she tries to make sense of where exactly here is. A medbay of some sort, she gathers, but without the usual indications of medical tools and with the presence of the two synth-skin covered humanoid droids she decides its more along the lines of a repair facility. A droid ship then? It seemed unlikely a ship run by organics would have left her in a room designated for droid repair if there was a medbay on board. With the presence of her weapons and all her gear accounted for it was unlikely too she was a prisoner.
From her pouch, Marina pulls out the droid remote. “**B3**,” she says quietly, waking the droid from it’s standby. “**I need you to go run some recon.**” The droid gives off a series of ecstatic beeps in binary to quickly for her to get more than a gist. “**And please be quiet about it,** Marina hisses and chastised the droid hovers for a moment before it zooms away out of the room. With her little droid now running a recon, it left just one question left to her.
What happened to Joran and Kit?

The hatch opens and B3 hesitates only a brief moment before setting off down the passageway per Marina's orders.
How much time has elapsed since the encounter with the Sandpeople isn't clear but it's a good guess she was out for awhile. She barely has time enough to collect her thoughts, however, before one of the droids - the "male" - begins to stir.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay jaybee - you're on. Sera isn't stirring but you can try and wake her if you like. Your restraining bolt has been removed but you are otherwise as before (with the exception of the new level which you are free to RP however you like) and with full health/CT.

The last memory was a loop of the same scene: Jason on his swoop bike with Sera holding on behind. They were circling a group of rodians at night. Hails of laser fire. Then a brilliant flash of white light.

```

```

Jason's eyes open and he immediately sighs upon seeing his surroundings. *'Why is it, everytime I reboot, I'm either behind plexiglass or in some sort of medbay environment? It's becoming a habit…one I need to break.'* Looking around the room, he notices Sera in a similar sort of situation to himself and noting that she hasn't stirred yet, he continues his survey of the area. Chuckling to himself upon spying another female in the room, he speaks up with his first assumption:
**"Ahhh, so you're my captor. I mean who wouldn't want to collect the great Jason Drexler, Shock Boxer Extraordinaire? But really, if you're going to put me on display like this…couldn't you at least take me out of this capsule toy arrangement and mount me in a glorious diarama?"**
It seems the droids quirks had been elevated by his capture and his constant agressive disabling. It wouldn't be long before his other functions would be completely disabled by his overriding arrogance, at least for this personality.
<details><summary>&quot;OOC&quot;</summary>

That'll do. I'm tempted to give Drexler a virus of some sort that progressively destroys his current personality. Or like a rogue program in his system. When you've had countless memory wipes over the course of millenia, something's bound to go wrong right?

Marina can hear B3's live feed in her earpiece as she listens to the droid's waking plea:
<...**hallway = shiny // lights = very shiny… B3 = good recon droid…**>

### **Alicia** (2012-02-08 16:00:39)

Marina's thoughts are quickly set aside as she notices the male droid in the tube begin to boot up and take notice of her.
An eyebrow raises half in amusment and half in surprise as the droid automatically assumes she's the reason for him being there and she would have any inclination as to who he is. "**Jason… who? Never heard of you.**" she says moving toward the tube controld to ascertain whether she would be able to open them. The unfamiliar controls giver her pause for a moment, but then start punching in almsot randomly the most likely combination to release the mechanism. "**Nor do I really care to. However, since we seem to be in the same predictament, being here quite against or wills…** " she looks around with a shrug, processing B3's latest report of his recon, and focusing on the controls.

### **jaybee3** (2012-02-08 16:17:38)

**"You've n-n-never heard of me?"** The droid stuttered in total awe as she moved towards the controls of his 'prison' and began punching them with her digits in a lacklustre attempt to free him. Resigned to fate, Drexler spoke up again, his voice thick with annoyance of being both imprisoned and unrecognised: **"Well can get me out or not? Since you've been granted the luxury of freedom to wander wherever we are."** He inspected the walls of his enclosure further, running his hands up and down them. **"….I could probably smash my way out if you're too inept to crack that little interface there, but then again I don't want to bruise my knuckles…they're best saved for a worthier foe than a damn glass cage of emotion."**

### **Alicia** (2012-02-08 16:24:52)

"**I've never seen controls like these,**" Marina admits. "**But… I've never met a computer I couldn't hack,**" she says just as the lid for the tube-like-coffin slides open. Stepping away she gives the unknown droid a cautious berth. "**Friend of yours?**" her head jerks in the direction of the female Falleen.

I'm sort of playing B3 as I've always imagined him, sorry if that's messing up any previous impressions of him. I'm not sure how I feel about the new Jason. He's kind of cranky. ![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)

*'Impressive…'* He notes, stepping out of the tube and giving a customary yawn through habit.
**"She's patched me up a few times, and I've saved her life. So yes, I guess you could call us friends."** He said looking over at Sera, before turning his attention back to the human. **"And you….no friends hidden around here? Or you all on your own?"**

## Re: System Recovery (Jason and Marina's Story)

### **Alicia** (2012-02-08 16:52:31)

Marina watches the droid who'd dubbed himself Jason and is slightly surprised how life-like his mannerisms were. Someone had put in a great deal of time to program such human like details. Caught staring she makes her way to the other panel of his companion's tube. "**Just B3-D3. I've sent it on some recon, we'll see how long that lasts - it seems easily distracted by shiny things.**" Going through the same combination, she gets this one opened a lot quicker than she did Jason's.
"**We seem to be in orbit of Tattooine still,**" Marina says, stepping away from the tube and toward the door taking a peek out. "**I have friends on the planet I'd like to get back to. Hopefully our… host will be inclined to go planetside again.**"

### **jaybee3** (2012-02-08 17:17:15)

Jason smiles when he catches the woman starting. *'Ladies do love the package….the Drexler package.'*
Seeing as Sera hadn't awoken yet, he decided to leave her to rest longer and follows his saviour to the door. **"Tattooine. Didn't care for it much….my host wasn't that hospitable and I doubt we'll be meeting your previous ones's any time soon."** He paused, peeking out the door and looking down the corridor himself before continuing. **"So before we go and greet our hosts, what should I call you?"**

## Re: System Recovery (Jason and Marina's Story)

### **Alicia** (2012-02-08 17:35:48)

Glancing over at Jason, she replies simply, "**Marina,**" before her gaze traces up and down the adjoining corridor and her thoughts drift towards her friends on the planet. Even if she couldn't join them it would be a reassurance to at least speak with them. Maybe even send them the coordinates to Iruji. In the Nova they would be able to get there without attracting attention, but it would be a matter of making sure the transmission wasn't intercepted by the wrong people.
In an endeavor to communicate. she reaches out with the Force to Joran hoping he was still nearby. *Safe*, she tells him mixing in her feelings of uncertainty.

**"Well Marina, pleased to meet you."** Jason chuckles to himself about a crude joke about ships docking in spaceports, or something of that ilk.
**"You're not much one for conversation are you? Or perhaps….I'm not used to others not talking about me."** He leaves a notable pause before stepping out into the corridor and walking a few paces. Turning back, he continues to speak adding a wink back to Marina this time **"….or perhaps you prefer to skip the chatter and get down to business? Either way…..there must be something else on this ship….a bed perhaps?"**

### **Alicia** (2012-02-08 18:07:03)

"**I converse with people I like,**" Marina says meaningfully with a roll of her eyes, her reverie broken once more by the human facsimile. The droid's personality was beginning to remind her of a more egotistical version of... Arek. A dull ache formed in the pit of her stomach as her thoughts turned to him and she had to take a deep breath as she pushes aside the million questions which threaten to ruin her concentration. *Ishealive?Whereishe?Washecaptured?ShouldIhavetoldhim?*
Following the droid down the hallway a cautious step behind, her eyes roll again at his opaque sexual interest and otherwise pretends to ignore him as she takes a look around.

He snorts at her retort as he paces down the hallway, occasionally observing himself in the polished surfaces while throwing idle comments the human's way **"Look, you and me both know, I'm irresistible….and anyway a good 'bout in the ring' with Drexler may loosen you up a bit."**
Cracking his knuckles and in anticipation and hope of some sort of threat further down the passageways of the ship, he begins to pull on his shockboxing gloves.

Marina's earpiece continues to spout B3's rather mundane findings as she and Jason proceed into the hallway. Her attempt to reach Joran returns a response: *Safe…?* It carries emotional overtones of both a confirmation of his safety and a questioning of where she is.
The passageway is in many ways similar to most medical facilities in its coloration and sterility. It's not an ugly ship overall, and from what they can tell so far it could easily serve as a small upscale freighter or private transport. It does seem deserted though - no maintenance droids, no staff, not even the sound of the engines. A few meters from where they entered the hall is another hatch that opens to a small room with what looks like a digital library along the walls. Data cubes and vidscreens, all dormant, line the perimeter of the room while some simple benches and chairs surround a center table. On one wall is a full-size window through which the planet Tatooine can be seen clearly. The pair of unlikely adventurers have enough experience in space travel to recognize their location: high planetary orbit.
A sudden halt in B3's reports is explained as both Marina and Jason round a bend in the hallway. There, speaking in very fluent Binary, is a tall blue man dressed in plain white clothes. Marina's Force sensitivity reveals that he is, in fact, a living being - despite a very odd, almost droid-ish, appearance. Thin wires and cables hang freely about his shoulders - presumably hair. His arms are gesturing wildly as B3 hovers excitedly about. The man's mouth is moving rapidly as the Binary language is spoken like a native-speaker. They are quite engaged in a lively conversation when he raises his hand, signaling B3 that it must be resumed later. He turns to Jason and Marina and speaks in perfect Basic, with a slight metallic ring to the words:
"**Greetings and blessings from the Maker, my friends,**" he says, bowing low, "**You may call me Andy. There are many questions, I'm sure, so let's take them one at a time, shall we?**"
Andy smiles and gestures to the library room behind them, his deep blue eyes shining with expectancy.

**1)** Jason would've been able to catch what B3 and Andy were saying easily but Marina would've been only able to pick out bits and pieces. Never having run a party game before, I don't know the usual way of doing that sort of thing. In this case it was mostly "catching up" type stuff - Andy was asking where B3 was from and he was describing the adventure - as he's seen it - from the beginning. Nothing heavy.
**2)** Alicia, your telepathy roll was a success to reach the planet no problem so you're free to continue volleying simple thoughts/emotions back and forth as you like. Joran is a willing recipient so there's no need to keep rolling here.
**3)** In terms of overall visuals just think of the cloning facility on Kamino - white, bright, sterile, smooth, etc. That's kind of what the ship is like, only (obviously) smaller inside. You haven't seen the outside and whatnot yet, just the little bit.

The ship impressed Jason, nowhere near his now-lavish tastes...too clinical but impressive all the same. *'Must have cost someone a lot of creds to put this together….speaking of which, I wasn't getting paid for Jabba's fights!'* He thought as they meandered round the ship, passing the library, and then they saw their host.
**"Maker? Oh dear…another religious nutter…"** Mutters Jason under his breath, when the peculiar man begins speaking to them. Jason then straightens his shoulders and rises to impressive full height, flexing his ample synthetic muscles.
**"My questions are as follows: Who?, What?, Where? and Why? But let's start with the Who."** Jason pauses for a second, checking the electricity coursing across his gloves, before switching to speaking in binary from basic. **"Who the hell are you?"**

Andy looks at Jason - and his gloves - and his smile begins to fade ever so slightly. He replies is a quick burst of Binary of his own. The exchange lasts less than a second, and Andy's smile lifts again as he turns his eyes to Marina and then back to Jason:
"**I really don't think the hall is the place to hold our first conversation. It's so… anti-climactic.**"
He nods once more in the direction of the digital library behind them.

"**You mean who am I besides who I just said I was? Calm yourself Jason Drexler, I am *not* your enemy. If my intent was to destroy you I would have stripped that silly flesh blanket from your frame and bathed you in low-level ion streams for a hundred years. You will not fight on this ship or you will most certainly find yourself outside it, free to fight whomever you may meet as you drift about the vacuum of space, slowly pulled towards the planet's surface below.

**"Fiesty one, you are."** Drexler says jokingly as he switches back to Basic and heads towards the video library, deactivating his gloves' electrical charge. Arms outstretched as he enters the digital vault, he spins round. **"Quite the stash you've got here. With all these video screens you probably stream all the filthy x-rated holoreels live from Corruscant's more seedy establishments….what with being on your own and all….lacking company.

B3 flies to Marina's side as she enters the room behind Jason, followed by Andy.
"**I'm lacking in neither company nor ways to fill my time, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.**"
There's plenty of seating, should either the Jedi or the shockboxer decide to sit, and their host makes his way to the opposite side of the room. The planet Tatooine spins slowly outside the window behind him, it's dangers somehow made trivial at such a distance. The hatch closes and the lights dim. Shapes begin to form in the center of the room, holographic images that accompany the forthcoming tale...
"**We'll begin with what you're probably wondering first, namely: Who I am** (at this he seems to stare just a little longer than appropriate at Jason) **and why you are here. The first question I've already answered in part - I'm Andy. It's not my true name, but it's the closest approximation. I am what is called a Celestial, first-generation in fact. Many thousands of years ago a ship crewed exclusively by droids made a jump to hyperspace and never returned. The details of what exactly happened are, frankly, irrelevant at the moment. Suffice it to say that the crew - and the ship itself - underwent a transformation that defied explanation. They became *alive* in every sense of the word. Self-awareness, meditation - even creating others like themselves after a time. I was among the first to be made. Over time we evolved to a point where we could easily transfer our consciousness into other mechanical, and then techno-organical, bodies. This was necessary for a number of reasons beyond maintenance. Ultimately we reached the point where we needed something closer to the synapses of a biological nervous system to function to our full potential - in a very real sense we outgrew our droid shells to become something altogether different. The hyperspace jump had dropped us on the edge of the known galaxy and, having extensive records of what existed within, decided to search beyond its boundaries. For many hundreds of years we were content to anticipate what we found at that first star, but had we known what would come next we would probably have turned around immediately…**"
The images of starscapes and galactic-scale travel routes suddenly vanishes, only to be replaced with scenes of brutal warfare between beings similar to Andy and vicious, ugly, warriors. The depictions progressed to include skirmishes with other droid-like beings as well.
"**There is much to fear going on outside the galaxy's borders. We are somewhat familiar with the Force, as you call it** (at this remark he nods to Marina) **and seem to be connected to it in some way. There are those among us that possess similar abilities and sensitivities, but there was nowhere near enough of us to survive the encounter with those races for long, so we fled. We returned here and waited on the edge, anxious to be followed. We've spent many years contemplating our role in the universe and have now decided what we must do: We believe we were sent by the Maker to prepare this galaxy for the evil that approaches.**"
He pauses, letting the three-dimensional battles in miniature drive home his story so far, and watches to make sure Jason and Marina are following along.

## Re: System Recovery (Jason and Marina's Story)

### **Alicia** (2012-02-09 19:06:56)

Marina holds in her own retort as she follows the pompous droid down the corridor, not giving him the enjoyment of any lasting conversation to fuel him on. The fact he pulls on his shockboxing gloves isn’t missed by the young Jedi and she habitually touches her belt where her lightsaber would normally be her hand instead meeting with the butt of her holstered blaster. For a moment she’s tempted to switch it from its regular setting to the ion, but instead leaves it as is.
As Marina looks around the ship, she’s struck by how clean it is. All her life of living on one ship or another and she’d never seen one so sterile. The medical frigate she had served on for a time seemed to barely compare, though during the war it had been overrun by refugees, wounded and medical personnel. Maybe that was it. It wasn’t just clean, but empty and quiet like there wasn’t an engine powering the freighter.
With her mental link with Joran established she passes on glimpses of the things she’s seeing, and when she passes the window of Tatooine shares that as well. Even if her rescuer wasn’t willing to go back down to the planet Joran could come get her in the *Nova*. She pauses for a long moment to take in the study, so far the only sign of habitation of the crew of the ship. For a moment she’s reminded of the Jedi Archive room with its vast databanks and stores of knowledge. Who ever owns this collection could definitely be called a bibliophile.
Continuing their wandering exploration, Marina is at first worried when her little droid friend’s progress reports stopped, but is then relieved to find him just around the corner. Speaking in rushed Binary to perhaps one of the strangest beings she had ever come across in her travels. She couldn’t help but to stare as the mechanic and the Jedi philosophical teachings about life compete to explain the being’s appearance. *Cyborg perhaps?* As their “host” motions toward the study they had just vacated, she continues her observation as Jason goes into his slew of questions and threats, but then allows herself to be ushered into the room oblivious to the fact their host - Andy was it? - had threatened the egocentric shockboxer right back. Perhaps it might have made her like Andy a bit more.
Moving back into the study, Marina heads toward the window staring out at the planet below. As B3 joins her she turns her attention to the small drop and taps it enough on its top it has to adjust itself. “**Silly B3,**” she says to it softly. “**Recon means don’t get caught. Imagine if Andy hadn’t been friendly.** ” With the lights dimming in the room she turns to look at the holographic display and then his lecture on his origins. Leaning back against the windowed bulkhead she listens attentively. Her years traveling with Silas had taught her that cultures took different interpretations of what was ultimately the Force at work, and likewise was taught to not belittle such traditions.
As his story draws to its climax she stands up straighter, and begins to draw up closer to the display. *Another war?* Voicing a dawning suspicion she says, “**You could have left us on Tatooine, which by the way, I’m grateful you provided your assistance, so I hope you didn’t bring us along because you thought we could be of some help to you?**”

### **BWS2K** (2012-02-09 20:17:08)

Andy listens to Marina quietly, hearing her unspoken concerns as well as her question. The holographic images freeze in place as he replies:
"**Actually, you *can* leave - if you choose. We have strict protocols about interacting with other sentients and I have no intention of making you stay if you don't want to. Some of us have already begun spreading news of these intergalactic threats and you're bound to hear more about it sooner or later. I have been assigned a slightly different duty: I am the Celestial ambassador to Humanity. We've monitored your Holonet for quite sometime but that will only go so far and I was hoping to get a feel for what Humans are really like. Jason Drexler, I admit, was more of a rescue operation. He and his companion seemed in trouble and I intervened as best I could. Our technology is in many ways superior to the galactic standard, though there are some intriguing areas where we could benefit from your advances.**"
Andy pauses again to find the right words:
"**No, what I really need to do now is speak with your Emperor Palpatine. I believe he'll be the one to decide how best to handle any impending danger. That'd be on… Coruscant? So that's where I'm headed next.**"

I'm sorry if I'm fumbling details, I'm really trying hard not to get lost on rabbit trails here. For the record: I'm content to break canon like an angry pirate, though we haven't done that too much just yet. Stay or not, but please stay *together* since that's the whole point. Please?

For a moment Marina could see some sense in what Andy was asking for. A chance to learn more about organics in the galaxy as a whole. On any other given day, Marina would have been happy to oblige, but going anywhere near the Galactic Core was not on her to do list. Realizing Andy may not know the amount of trouble he was probably getting himself into
“**Have you ever heard the phrase ‘History is written by the victors’? In this case, Palpatine was the winner so he gets to spread the news of events as suits his needs, and by sending his adversaries to ground the truth or at least their viewpoint rarely makes the light of day. Our self proclaimed *Emporer* isn’t all the HoloNet leads the public to believe. He may hear what you have to say, but I doubt anything good will come of it.**” She says the word Emperor with a great deal of distaste but the rest of her speech comes out evenly. “**If you decide to go to Coruscant, I’m afraid you’ll have to let me off here.**”

### **jaybee3** (2012-02-10 03:32:08)

Jason stood stoic, his arms now folded across his chest, listening to the exchange between the organics. All this talk about Maker and Celestials was over Jason's head and he immediately archived it in the ridiculous directory structure of one of his drives. **"Celestials indeed…what utter sith spit."** He may have uttered under his breath. *'More like droids with a superiority complex because they can't pilot a damned starship.'*
Drexler's subroutines were trying to cross reference all archives versus the holonet for Andy's awr he mentioned, they only drew a blank. But through up a few interesting quotations for partial files.

```
>&#8230;
>C:/ Found antonym:War Relevance 97%&#8230;
>C:/ sCode.bsc Outputting to >1&#8230;&#8230;..
>Peace is a Lie, there is only passion. 
>Through passion I gain strength.
>######################################
>######################################
>######################################
>&#8230;
```

Was the most notable. A mantra that the droid had lived his life by in the ring. Ever prepared for combat. Defeat was never an option. He would win at whatever the costs, however Phyrric. He didn't know where the file had come from, but it had been poorly scrubbed from his drives after what he presumed was a contract a while ago.
His train of thought it broken at the mention of him being a rescue operation and his anger flourishes to the surface once more and he lets out a violent attack in binary: **"RESCUE OPERATION?! I think it more as you being too weak to save yourself from a few little creatures and you need to recruit the BEST to your cause. Scurrying away in your starship such fear….cowardice. Where is your pride? Pride to fight and die in battle? You believe yourselves to have transcended your droid "shackles" to become superior to us and self-proclaimed prophet for this Maker? Sounds more like you need a good memory wipe to remove whatever corruption you received when you jumped to hyperspace through shabby pilotting!"**
He switches to Jawa next to ask his next question, feeling it to be the most appropriate language: **"That being said…and since I'm of little use to you, what with being *only a droid and a rescue operation at that.* What's in it for me if I could grant you an audience with the Emperor? He is afterall, my biggest benefactor."**
It wasn't entirely the truth but in a roundabout way it was. The Emperor controlled the flow of credits, yada yada, Jason get's paid in them. But if Andy had access to technology superior to the rest of the galaxy, perhaps he might have a weapon that could benefit him on his path to Universal renown, to rival that of the Emperor. Credits would be welcome too of course.
If it wasn't one of them yabbering on, it was the other (now that she'd finally found her tongue). The frigid woman's distaste for Palpatine was evident as was her unwillingness to go to the galactic capital. **"What wrong, Marina? Had a run in with some stormies?"** He snorts, switching back to basic.

## System Recovery (Jason and Marina's Story)

### **Alicia** (2012-02-10 04:05:39)

Jason's attitude hardly surprised Marina, but the sudden switch to Binary made her suspicious. Not able to understand all of the burst, she makes a note to ask B3 for a playback later. When he switches to Jawa a language again she couldn't understand, but recognized from her time on Tatooine she wonders if he's purposefully cycling languages to find out what neither of them can understand. Adding to her mental note, she wants to see about installing a translator module to B3's already packed in hardware.
Marina is hardly surprised when Jason decides to make a quib at her. After all she wasn't exactly hiding her anti-imperial sentiments, but that wouldn't mean she would have had any major conflicts against the new regime. While Jason's accusation was accurate he didn't have to know that. One could be anonymous and not like something after all. "**I fought in the war serving the *Republic* I want nothing to do with his dictatorship, and his propaganda will be all over Coruscant. More so than what you'd fine on the HoloNet,**" the young woman says to the shockboxer evenly the last part she says to Andy as if wanting to stress her point.

**"Serving the Republic and not one of the endless stream of Clones? How intriguing, you do have hidden delights after all, Marina."** He left his comment at that and dedicated his subroutines to browsing for more information in his archives on the Clone Wars and the Republic's allies at the time.
**"Either way as long as someone's paying I don't care who's in charge. Is life really that bad under Palpatine's rule? I guess if you don't have secrets to hide?"** His holoprojectors flickered to life, morphing his appearence into a slightly taller - due to his physical frame - variation of Marina. Imitating a comic version of her, he begins quaking at the knees and pretending to bit his nail. **"Oh no! Not Corruscant!!"** He said matching her voice patterns based on what he'd heard so far. Disengaging the holoprojectors and returning to his human form, a grin cracked across his face. **"But then, in our pasts or in our memories, whether organic or otherwise, we've all got skeletons in our closets.

A craft I've aspired to imitate to perfection over the best part of a millenium."** He paused, a smile now settled on his face, his mood appeased for the mean time.
**"However I am bitterly disappointed my synthetic wrappings were seen through so easily."** He said, not addressing anyone inparticular, while tugging at his skin, pinching it so the blood rushes to surface. Still with his grin on his face, he continued: **"It's an ability that most don't seem to possess."** He scratched his head. **"But then again…most don't have a medbay to examine you in detail, I suppose."**

B3 knows of Marina's inability to follow true Binary and decides to stream a live translation as best he can into her waiting ear bud. "**B3 = good translator droid…**"
Andy watches the exchange with interest.
"**Perhaps it *would* be best to return you to the planet, maybe at separate locations…?**" he offers, considering the present bickering to ultimately be counter-productive, if not very informative and somewhat amusing. There are more important matters at hand, however. Folding his hands behind his back, he continues: "**We may have been a little too naive in trusting our sources about your Emperor,**" he turns to address Marina specifically, "**You seem to disagree with my intentions - why? I would appreciate your input before you leave…**"

Marina about to insult the replica droid further decides instead to turn her attention to Andy. Her thoughts are interrupted by the scream and she wonders if Jason's companion has finally woken. Looking at him pointedly for a moment, she goes back to ignoring him and addresses Andy, "**Your intentions to warn us are admirable I just fear putting your trust fully in Palpatine may not end up with the results you may like. He may decide to help, but then turn on you, much like he did to the Republic. Or flat out refuse to help and then fight the victor. He may even just decide not to do anything and bide his time to see what happens. He seems very good at waiting. There might be other options, however. While they may not have full control over galactic affairs various Senators may prove to be a sympathetic ear.**" She shrugs indicating that it's all speculation. With Jason hopefully gone out of the room to help Sera she adds, "**I would like to help you, but going to Palpatine's doorstep would likely be detrimental to my health.**"

The scream draws Jason from the room rather abruptly, giving Andy time to think on Marina's words...
"**You may be right. I had my suspicions when I read about the Jedi - we studied our records concerning them often in order to learn more about ourselves and our unique connection to the Force. It troubled me to think that they could have somehow betrayed your Republic so easily.**"
The holograms shift to displays of various Jedi training katas and dress, locations and lore. Andy glances at the closed hatch and then back to Marina. His words are softer, respectful of what she has said - and what she hasn't:
"**And what would *you* suggest then? My purpose for being here is to warn Humanity of the evil I've seen. Others will be dispatched with similar goals but since your Emperor is Human it made sense to send me first. It's very likely that this galaxy will encounter war like it has never before imagined within a few short decades…**"<div style="text-align: center;">

Jason darts across the hall and into the room where he and Marina first awoke. Sera runs to meet him with arms outstretched. All pretenses have dropped - she was clearly frightened but is now relieved to see a familiar face:
"**Jason! Where are we? What's going *on?***"

Embracing the pseudo-Falleen to calm her nerves, Jason then takes a step back to fill her in on the story so far. **"…So basically, we've been abducted by one of those religious nutter types, who wants to have a chat with Palpatine on Corruscant."**
Taking her hand, he begins to lead her back to the others. **"If he offers us any punch, I think it's probably best we don't drink it."** He says with a chuckle as he meanders back down the clinical corridors.
Stopping before the library, he turns to Sera once more and adds in a hushed voice: **"Oh yeah, just a quick warning….he looks a little bit odd…so don't gasp or anything when you see him."**

### **Alicia** (2012-02-11 09:04:11)

Marina sighs partly with relief and exasperation. Andy at least seemed to understand her reluctance, but the fact she didn’t have an answer for him made her feel useless. “**I’m sorry, I don’t have the answers you seek,**” Marina says sincerely. “**The Force moves in mysterious ways, bringing people together for good reasons. Being here… it’s a sign I’m not meant to go into exile like I had planned,**” she says, her gaze turning to the planet. If nothing else she could send Joran and Kit to Iruji, it was the least she could do for them.
With some reluctance the young Jedi turns back to the Celestial. “**I’d like to stay and help you figure out a way. I have a feeling it’s not going to be as easy as you originally thought. You’re going to need all the help you can get.**”

## Re: System Recovery (Jason and Marina's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2012-02-11 12:10:46)

Sera follows Jason into the library chamber where Andy has his eyes closed, quietly considering Marina's concerns.
"**He's not *that* bad-looking.**" she mutters under her breath, spotting the Celestial deep in thought. "**Not *my* type, but not too far from it…**" She winks at Jason, feeling much safer in his company.
After several tense moments Andy's eyes open and he speaks - not to Marina, Jason, or Sera, but, apparently, to the ship. His speech is close to Binary but more elegant and almost musical, far more pleasing to hear in its natural form even to Marina's Human ears. It defies translation for all droids present nonetheless. The ship responds in kind and the two have a short exchange while the others look on. At last Andy breaks the reverie with a hearty metallic laugh. The joke is anyone's guess, but he composes himself to explain:
"**I mentioned protocols earlier - we have strict rules about how we can interact with other species here in your galaxy. And despite our apparent overall technological superiority we are still extremely brittle creatures with weaknesses not unlike those of yourselves. There *is* a loophole it would seem: If I move into another body so that my appearance is less noticeable to the galactic public I should be able to investigate this situation freely. My mission still stands but maybe it can be better accomplished another way.**"
He's all smiles at this prospect but whether it's because he finds the idea "cute" or because he's glad to be free from protocols isn't clear. It is, in fact, a little of both. Andy motions to the walls of the room:
"**I'll return in a moment but please feel free to indulge yourselves of our digital archives. The computer will understand your voice commands in Basic or Binary as you prefer. We can discuss your futures when I get back. Please excuse me…**" With a smile and a nod Andy leaves the room and proceeds down the hall to another part of the ship. The hologram has once again returned to a map of the known galaxy and it swirls silently in the room while the light from Tatooine's surfaces spills in through the window beyond.

Leaving Andy to his thoughts Marina turns to glance out the window opening her thoughts to Joran. She didn’t know how to translate all she needed to express to him through the link, her ability in telepathy only being minor in the end only regret filters through. Her attention is drawn to the door as Jason and the Falleen enter the library. Before she can offer a greeting to the woman, Andy breaks out into his strange song-like communication with the ship. It hadn’t occurred to her the ship itself might be like Andy – sentient in the strange way droids could become. Transfixed she listens to the strange dialogue and then is startled when he laughs.
As Andy excuses himself, the young Jedi gives him a nod and turns back to the other two droids. Ignoring Jason she approaches his companion. “**I’m Marina,**” she says with a friendly smile, holding out her hand for Sera to shake.

**"Move into another body? Woah woah woah. What's that nutter on about now?"** Jason's outburst starts as soon Andy has left the room, out of earshot? Frankly, he doesn't care. **"It's bad enough I've had a history lesson and readings from techno-psalms one through eight hundred…but now he wants one of our bodies."** Drexler has begun angrily pacing back and forth in the library, stopping himself occassionally but still managing to exhale a few insults in languages he didn't even known. **"I'm JASON DREXLER…I don't submit to them…they submit to me."** He bounces on his toes, still ranting to himself, throwing punches in front of him while ducking and weaving. **"Undefeated King of The Ring!"**
Still fuming, he plonks himself in a chair and barks at one of the computers. **"Show me replays of my fights throughout the galaxy."** He hushes his voice and changes to binary. **"At least, just Jason Drexler's exploits….can you save any other records of droid referenced: El Oh Vee Three Ar and transfer it to me remotely….that''s if you find anything?"**

Sera reaches out hesitantly to shake Marina's offered hand. "**I'm Sera,**" she says simply, "**Are you part of all this…?**" Jason's explanation included why the droids were there and something about Andy, but he hadn't mentioned a woman.
The ship's computer responds to Jason's requests in a few seconds' time. The holographic display shifts to a more appropriate size smaller and nearer to his seat. The image is split into several smaller feeds - each running through the details, highlights, and results of the numerous matches Jason Drexler has fought (and won). His internal comlink chirps to life with the cold Binary of a status report:
<*Search query for droid designation **L0-V312** on local archives begun…results pending…*>

So jaybee - if you want to type up an account that somehow includes Palpatine or Order 66 or his future plans to dissolve the Galactic Senate that'd be great. We talked about some things before - he could have been a bodyguard of someone close to the Sith during the Clone Wars, a protocol droid for Palpatine when he was just the Supreme Chancellor - anything like that. It doesn't have to be that he was standing next to Palpatine himself, maybe he just overheard or delivered a message to/from him to L0's master. We'll RP it as a record of some sort that L0 made, or maybe as an entry that his master made as an explanation for why he needed a memory wipe that the ship's computer can dig up somehow. I'll handle how it's revealed but if you want to flesh out the actual details that's fine with me. You can message me what you come up with. Include anything you think might motivate Jason to work more as a team to investigate this matter of "the Emperor is actually a really bad guy" since that's essentially where this is headed. We'll be trying to find some of those senators Marina mentioned. I do love a good cameo... ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)
Also - I'm pretty much embracing the idea that Andy is a little crazy. Not like *completely* nuts, but being in a droid body will probably accentuate his "droidness" and will be fun. Like Captain Steel. I have the character sheet very nearly finished and it should be up soon.

Jason's ranting is hard to ignore and she turns slightly to stare blankly at the droid. "**Is he always like this?**" Marina asks Sera slowly, wondering how the other could stand him if this was his personality all the time. "**Chill *champ***," she says loudly so Jason could hear her, the last word coming out sarcastically. "**He said a body, not one of ours.**" With a roll of her eyes she goes back to ignoring the egotistical droid. The young Jedi turns her attention back to Sera and with a shake of her head answers the Falleen droid's question. "**Andy brought us aboard around the same time. Rescued me from a Sand People ambush.**"

"**Ah.**" Sera replies, somewhat uncomfortable with the way Marina addresses Jason. Pressured to stand up for her man: "**Well if you mean is he always ready for a fight, then yes. But as you can see,**" she motions to the numerous displays of his matches, "**He knows what he's doing. But if you're here too - what did that guy, Andy, mean about our futures? Last I knew we were on a hunt for Jabba…**" Her hand goes to where the restraining bolt used to be and Sera continues to process what's going on.
The ship's computer suddenly freezes all the images in front of Jason and fades them all out, only to be replaced by a larger one:
<*Search results for droid designation L0-V312 on local archives: 2 files, badly damaged. Attempting playback of first file…*>
The display is shaky and full of static, but appears to be security footage from outside a prestigious office (if the trappings are any indication). To the side of the door stands a lone guard. A few moments of this and then a figure comes running down the hall shouting - the audio is heavily distorted. The guard springs into action and with a well-placed punch lays the intruder out. The scene changes to display some text apparently deleted a few hours after having been logged as an incident report. The timestamp seems to match that of the video and it's a good guess they were scrubbed by the same person. Sections have been corrupted and don't translate, but what remains intrigues all those present:
*…iped the guard…led…he others…L0-V312 was re-assigned…ancellor's orders…worried.*
The message is left hovering tantalizingly in front of Jason.

Going a little bit different than your suggestion for simplicity's sake, but otherwise great stuff jaybee. Careful Marina - that's her man you're mouthing off to... ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif) Happy Valentine's Day all!

"**Andy I think is going to give you the option to stay or to go on your way if you wish it.**" Marina glances over at Jason wondering if she was going to have to be tolerating his presence. After all there was no glory or even a payday to be had traveling with them on what they had planned. There was no profit in trying to save the galaxy from some still galactically unknown threat. Marina smiles at Sera and just shrugs noticing the woman’s gesture toward the bare metal spot where the restraining bolt had worn through. “**At least you have the option now**.”
Remembering she still had yet to contact Joran properly the young Jedi heads over to one of the free consoles, away from Jason’s earshot. “**Uhm, computer… Can you open a transmission for me from here, please?**”

## Re: System Recovery (Jason and Marina's Story)

Sera nods at Marina's comment and the two part ways. She goes to watch the display at Jason's side while Marina takes strides in the opposite direction. After hearing her inquiry, the ship's computer displays several options in Basic text on the console in front of her. Among them are *encrypted transmission* and *text-only*. A smaller panel opens along the bottom of the console where she can type in the comm channel frequency for Joran.<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

Grateful for the response from the computer she plugs in Joran's comm frequency unsure if he'd made it back to the Nova choosing the option for an encrypted transmission. Opening up the frequency she talks quietly to the panel in front of her. "**Joran.. It's Marina are you receiving this?**"
"**Marina! Are you alright - where *are* you?!**"
"**That would be a hard question to answer, but I'm alright,**" she pauses for a moment before adding, "**I've.. made a new friend. I can tell you I'm in orbit on one of the strangest ships I've ever been on. Are you and Kit alright? There were Sandpeople patrolling the cliffs."**
"**Yeah, we're okay. I don't think they know about the shelter so we're safe. I've been up all night looking for any news about Chayse. So far - nothing. I'm not certain that's a good thing though. Are you and your *new friend* coming down any time soon? Kit's anxious for some girl talk…**" he chuckles and Marina can hear the Wookie in the background.
"**I'm not sure when, but it hopefully won't be too much longer. I…**" Again she pauses considering her words. "**I don't think I'll be going with you to Iruji.**"
"**Well that's good I guess, but what do you mean *with* - I have no idea where this place is. And I thought you were really hoping to lay low for awhile, what changed your mind?**"
"**I trust you to go there without leading other's behind you…. I'll feel better knowing the two of you are at least safe, but it would seem my time out in the galaxy hasn't come to an end. There's a threat coming… It's hard to go into details over the comms, but I've told my new friend, Andy, that I would help him.**"
A long pause goes by, and then: "**Andy, huh? That's an… interesting name…**" Another pause. "**I assume you've already thought about asking for *our* help which means Andy is either about to do something really crazy or really dangerous. Given recent events, I can't say I blame you for wanting *somebody* to get some rest. We'll go, Marina, but keep in touch. There's not enough of us left to be going off on adventures alone anymore…**" Joran's last comment carries a slightly foreboding tone to it.
"**Oh I'll be in touch as best as I can. You can count on that. I actually have some messages I'd like you to pass along…**"
"**I can do that.**" Marina transmits the personal messages to Joran and after the ship's computer signals their reception, the conversation continues: "**So that's it then. May the Force be with you Marina Cloudspinner - Oh, Kit says to take care too.**" he laughs as Kitkatta once again chimes in.
Marina laughs, "**I hope I'll see you before we part ways. I also want to grab the rest of my gear.**"
Some commotion ensues and she can't quite make out any words, then: "**Yeah, I think you're right Kit - she just wants another Wookie hug. We're not going anywhere so let us know when you'll be stopping by. Sound good?**"
"**Of course I do want one! Who knows when I'll get another. I'll be in touch,**" she says before cutting out the transmission.
Marina turns to face Jason and Sera only to find some interesting text hovering holographically between them.

**"…iped the guard…led…he others…L0-V312 was re-assigned…ancellor's orders…worried."** Jason repeats, his macho act now dropped upon the revelation. **"Computer, Is there any way to clear that video up? A glimpse into my past is a very rare thing indeed."**
The droid ponders the text again *'…iped the guard…led…he others…L0-V312 was re-assigned…ancellor's orders…worried.'*
**"Computer, can you try and fill the blanks, using a Basic dictionary search for the likely possible missing words, I want to make sure of something."** He said standing from his chair and waving at the screen.

The floating characters begin to flip rapidly through combinations that are almost too fast for even Jason's electronic perception to discern. Some of them aren't even identifiable as any language he's heard of.
<*Results: Deductive analysis concludes approximately 60% chance the message was as follows…*>

Content she had finally been able to have a more productive conversation with Joran, the young Jedi turns around only to be spot the curious text hovering between Jason and Sera. She sits there thoughtfully, wondering what the droids were up to.
The results of the word fill in raises an eyebrow. “**Interesting friend you’re trying to track down,**” Marina speaks up, getting up from the console she was working up to join them. “**What’s the source of the file? If you can get your hands on the original you would get more.**”

## Re: System Recovery (Jason and Marina's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2012-03-09 10:09:23)

The question may have been directed at Jason but the ship's computer replies:
<*Both file fragments are currently being stored in the database of a large land vehicle crossing the desert surface of the planet below…*>
A second image - a live orbital feed - opens next to the scrambled text. Even people who've never set foot on Tatooine know the unmistakable profile of a Jawa sandcrawler. Known to scavenge droids from wherever they may find them, it doesn't seem unreasonable that the memory wipes would be stored temporarily in case needed for a particularly difficult droid. There's a moment of silence as the three watch the mobile base roll along the sands, and then:
<*Analysis of the files and the other contents of the database indicates it is scheduled for permanent deletion in 4.68 hours. The droid designation associated with them is unavailable at this time, but there's a heading of "Astromech, red" on the parent file folder. Any further study of the file will require either the original file, soon to be deleted, or the droid itself.*>

Marina looks between the feed and the words floating around it from the computer a frown creasing her brow. "**Well, then. There isn't much time to lose, is there?**" she says turning her attention to Jason. "**Of course it's all up to you since this seems more important to you than to me. I just need to get down to the planet.**" Her goal to still meet Joran before they left orbit still very much at the forefront.

**"That's one way to put it."** Drexler says as he stares at the deciphered words. **"It's not the first time I've had a memory wipe, I'm sure. My memory has been patchy at best for the last few hundred standard years, like waking up after a few too many corellian brandies."** He stands once more and begins to pace once more before the images meld into the Jawa sandcrawler at Marina's enquiry. **"To find out about my past? I'm not really bothered. It may as well remain lost to history like the jedi order. But if it means making a few credits along the way through some good old fashioning blackmailing against the most powerful person in the Galaxy…I'm game."** He adds with a smile on his face. **"The question is…how do we, or at least I, get to that sandcrawler? Orbital droppod straight onto it I'm thinking. The stylish approach."**

An eyebrow raises at his suggestion. For a moment Marina wonders if he really didn't care about acquiring it to piece together his past, but really in the end it doesn't matter to her. "**Stylish, but perhaps a bit unnecessary. We could just land nearby if Andy is willing. It's quite possible they'll trade or sell for the data and maybe even the droid.**"

As if in answer to Jason's remark, the hatch slides open and in strides a unique sight even for those well-accustomed to what the galaxy has to offer. It might best be described as a modified 3PO-series protocol droid covered in blue and modest but uncharacteristic armor plating. From all accounts it's the type of droid some eccentric diplomat might own - perhaps one with a penchant for interesting bodyguards. The blue eye sockets glow bright as it places its hands on its hips:
"**Again with the name-calling, Jason Drexler?**" comes a mechanical voice. Somehow it retains both Andy's character and the trademark speech and body patterns of the series. He walks across the room and stares at the live feed.
"**No need to bring me up to speed, the ship's computer has me informed. If there's a connection between the Emperor and Jason it would seem appropriate to address this first. My recommendation for landing is to err on the side of caution - but my archives on this species lack any firsthand experience either of you may have had. If they are easily scared - and easily subdued - then a surprise appearance seems suitable. This ship is quite capable of *that*.**"
Both Marina and Jason (and Sera) are reminded of how they made it on-board in the first place.
"**If you've made arrangements to meet some friends,**" at this he nods to Marina, "**then maybe it would make sense to stop there first?**"
Andy pauses and turns his head, trying to assess his new body as if still getting used to its confines: "**Do you think this is a suitable appearance? I tried to mimick a familiar form without becoming completely useless in whatever task we find ourselves…**"
