</span>
**"Gimme 20 creds on the kid, he looks scrappy!"
"Are you spaced?! The red-head there is going to mop the floor with'm, one arm and all! You're on!"**
The training atrium is a buzz of activity as a pair of Jedi trainees prepare themselves to spar at its center. One is a grey-eyed youth just entering his teen years wielding a blue-bladed lightsaber with a handled that is longer than his arm. The other is a red-haired young woman approaching her middle-teen years. In one hand shield wields a green-bladed lightsaber, while her other hand is oddly missing all the way to her elbow joint. Several other initiates and padawans sit in a circle around the the sandy dueling pit, varying degrees of perspiration coating their foreheads. A mottled collection of Republic personnel and adherents of other force-using paths also gather around the pit, credits changing hands in discreet, and not-so discreet, wagers on the sparring matches.
Both turn to bow and salute to a massive Feeorin Jedi Master, who acknowledges them with nothing more than a simple nod before returning his attention to the maintenance of his meditation garden, a small Ithorian girl potting plants at his side. Behind him in a separate portion of the garden is a tall, shirtless youth who appears to be stacking and arranging large rocks by hand. Sweat drenches the padawans dark skin, and every so often he looks over toward the ensuing sparring match and gives a wry shake of his head before he returns to his rock arranging.
A soldier steps away from the throng of onlookers and approaches the Feeorin, the red-badging on his shoulder showing him to be an officer, and the numerous medals adorning his chest plate show him to be a well decorated one at that. He spares an amused glance for the padawan stacking rocks before he shakes his head and snaps off a crisp salute to the Jedi Master.
**"New orders'll be coming in soon General, I'm going to get the men ready. What'd the kid do?"**
The soldier, a clone by the look of him, inclines his head slightly toward the youth, although he keeps his voice low for the Jedi Master's ears only.
**"Nothing."
"Nothing?"**
The clone trooper's brow furrows and he looks back at the youth and then at the Feeorin, his eyebrow quirked in askance.
**"Nothing. Padawan Torendau has some things to work out for himself. This is one of the ways he works them out."**
Frowning, the clone commander takes another look at the padawan, and indeed the youth's bearing and the fervor with which he carries out his exercise would indicate that he is performing the task willingly, rather than as penance.
**"Couldn't he just, ya know…"**
As the soldier trails off, he waggles his fingers, pantomiming the use of the Force. The Jedi Master merely shakes his head and completes the trench that he has been digging, turning to accept a plant from the little Ithorian before gently placing it in the dirt.
**"Won't work anything out that way. Besides, it's good to sweat every so often; over dependence on the Force is a weakness and leads to the dark side."**
The Jedi Master then rises to his feet and dusts his massive hands on he hem of his robe. After giving a few instructions to the young Ithorian, the giant Feeorin moves over towards the sparring ring, the spectators gathered around the ring parting before him. The clone trooper merely shakes his head again and follows after, and when the Jedi Master comes to stand before the two duelists, he folds his arms over his chest and looks each of the fighters directly in the eyes before nodding to himself.
**"Begin!"**

Ash scowls as he faces Adalyn across the dueling circle, displeased at the prospect of another ignominious defeat at the hands of the older padawan. Since her arrival he's had to accept that even with her self-imposed handicap the older girl is still a superior fighter, and any thoughts he might have had of defeating her to demonstrate his own skill have long since been quashed, temporarily put on hold until he can develop the necessary ability. Not that he doesn't plan to try - he told Adalyn not so long ago that she's his rival, and he won't be happy unless he gives his all.
He recalls the fight after which he made that claim and they had come just a little closer to understanding each other - or possibly by scratching the surface he had only found more mystery underneath. Time would tell. But he's not focusing, and that was the key reason for his previous defeat That, and he let Adalyn get in under his guard.
Steadying his breathing and stilling his body, Ash begins to block out the babble of the crowd, the actions of the other apprentices, even - though this last is harder - the presence of Master Ruhk. Nothing exists other than himself, Adalyn, and the space surrounding them. He sees her in stark relief within his mind, acknowledging her features in a mechanical sort of way: her slender, graceful build - *she moves so fast!*; her long red hair - *uncontrollable, surely, won't it get in the way and get damaged by one of our sabers? And wouldn't I feel guilty if it were my doing?*; her severed arm, hidden beneath her sleeve but evident enough regardless - *she's remembered her training with a regular saber well enough Ash, don't forget that. She still beats you.*; her fine Tapani features - *what's going on behind those eyes?*. The only sound he hears is the crackle and thrum of their lightsaber blades.
He offers a salute, bringing his blade up toward his forehead. Then, mind still clear, body responding perfectly to the clarity of his thoughts, he slips with ease into combat form. His saber rests against his right hip, the long hilt extending diagonally across his lower back, the blade out to the side. His left arm raises upward in Adalyn's direction, palm outstretched. His feet shift outward, planted firmly, ready to stand strong against an initial strike - or launch him forward towards his opponent.
Ash is barely aware when Master Ruhk catches his eyes, but it distracts his mind from playing over the upcoming fight long enough to be made aware of the Feeorian's subsequent nod. The duel has begun.
He begins circling, aware of Adalyn mirroring him opposite. His left hand slips down across his waist to join the right on his weapon's hilt. Then he breaks into a run, charging across the circle, bearing down on her to strike at her right. Only at the last second does he reveal the action as a feint, spinning on his heels and bringing the energy blade around to her left flank. Successful or not, he spins away again, returning his posture to the previous form as he waits for retaliation.

Adalyn stood waiting for Master Ruhk to give the command for their spar to commence, her gaze coming to rest on the youth that was her opponent. A rivalry had formed between the two of them, well more on Ash’s part than her own. Her part was more a determination to not lose to the younger trainee, proving to him that she had indeed deserved the place by Master Ruhk’s side. Why they both couldn’t be his Padawans only Master Ruhk could say and he wasn’t.
Her saber came down to her side after the salute, an at ease posture until Ruhk gave the command to start. As their Master came to stand at the edge of the ring, she meets the Feeorin’s gaze, her displeasure at having to face her opponent in such a manner plain to see. Absently she takes note of the presence of the Clone officer, but it was hardly a concern just that moment and she ignores his presence. With the command to begin she takes a defensive posture, waiting for the moment she knew would come. From her experience, Ash was always the first to break, his impatience getting the better of him. As they begin to circle each other, her gaze doesn’t leave her grey-eyed opponent, her expression serious.
Her own thoughts begin to clear, finding the place she had trained for years to attain under Master Fillin Ta’s guidance. The flows and ebbs of the Force would guide her, she knew, and if she needed it to she could affect the outcome of the fight like she had so many times during battles with the Separatists. That could wait, though.
She’s not surprised when he finally charges at her, she tries to get out of the way of his full strength put behind the swing before bringing her own saber against him using her speed more than her strength to find her way between the reach of his long-handled saber. Missing the feint she feels the blade of the training saber hit her. While the boy would have the satisfaction of the hit she could already feel her body negating the energy from his attack. Ash didn’t have to wait long for her retaliation, though she tempers it to concentrate on her defense during the early stages of the fight.

Although Adalyn is the quicker and more experienced fighter, Ash has the reach and leverage advantage with his long-hafted lightsaber, and as he barrels forward his last minute feint strikes true, leaving a painful weal across Adalyn's left thigh. But the elation of striking the first blow is short lived, as the red-haired Padawan draws upon the Force and absorbs the energy of Ash's training saber and then dissipates it as a benign cloud of heat around her. Through some trick of the ambient light, and the evaporation of the sweat-heavy air around the two, the cloud of heat appears as a red-tinged shimmer that blows away in all directions around the two. Assuming a defensive posture, Adalyn licks a blow out at the retreating initiate, but it serves to do nothing more than ward Ash away as he resets his stance.
**"Didja see that?! He hit'er clean and she took it like a nerf-lick! She's cheating!"
"Must not know many Jedi son; they all cheat! Now throttle-off and get your creds set for when Red here beats the runt and I win!"**
Many of the non-Jedi onlookers erupt a brief bout of applause at the display, but a glower from Master Ruhk quickly hushes them to low murmurs. The Jedi Master then returns his attention to the ensuing combat, his face as passive as a particularly *austere* purple slab of granite. When he speaks, the Feeorin's voice contains the steady rumble of an approaching thunderhead; low yet projecting power.
**"You're not a bull bantha Ash, so don't charge like one; fight to your strengths. And don't look at me that way Padawan Pallax. Your comrades will test you more than any battlefield, and expose to you greater weaknesses. These practices will serve you well… If you should choose to learn from them. Continue!"**
At Master Ruhk's sharp command all fringe conversation breaks off and the atrium is once again thrown into silence, aside from the constant, heavy thudding of stone-against-stone as the Korunnai Padawan behind them all continues his tireless work.

### **simplyscribed** (2011-06-14 17:10:52)

Irritation flits across Ash's features as his brilliant maneuver is rendered null by his opponent's use of the Force. A small part of him hopes that Master Ruhk will declare it a foul but he is wise enough not to expect it. The Master will let it slide, despite the fact that as a youngling Ash himself only has rudimentary abilities in the Force and no training in its combat applications. He'll see it as a challenge.
The odds against him climbing even higher, Ash isn't in the greatest mood to listen to his Master condemn a tactic that actually *worked*. Truthfully he knows he had good reason to strike fast and hard in those initial seconds. Adalyn is the better fighter, and, apparently, is going to be allowed to use her Force powers. No, if he'd waited for her to come to him he'd be fighting a losing battle from the start. Keeping her off-kilter, that's essential. She's gotten used to him making the first attack but didn't expect him to be aware of his own fault, to use any cunning. Not that he has any reason to think that he'll be able to pull off another trick like it now she's wise.
Still, no harm in trying. And maybe his own meager Force ability can be of some use after all.
Their blades crash together in a blurred frenzy of blows. Apparently on the defensive, Ash allows himself to be pushed back toward the crowd, withdrawing carefully from the reach of Adalyn's weapon.
*Fight to my strengths, shall I?* he muses, then leaps back in among the audience. *Let's see her strike me amongst this lot.*

Adalyn probably would have glowered again at the master if she didn’t have better sense and wasn’t focused on her young opponent. She ignored the cheers and admonishments of the crowd for her use of the Force, though the haze surrounding her was harder to ignore as was the weal his saber had left on her. She fought through it all and began pushing him back toward the crowd, he just managed to stay out of her reach. He surprised her as he suddenly moved into the crowd of observing bystanders, using them to shield and hide him.
The act seemed rather cowardly to her, using innocent bystanders, and it made her angry. A Separatist or anyone else wanting to kill a Jedi wasn’t about to let a group of people get in their way to do so. However, she wasn’t a Separatist and he was likely using her concern for the bystanders against her. *Learn from a comrade indeed,* she thought. *I never would have expected him to go hide in the midst of a crowd, and yet… that’s just the sort of tactic someone might use.* Her anger quickly dissipates as she takes that into consideration and begins focusing on her task of extracting him from within the crowd.
Rather than following him into the crowd and risk losing him completely she stops. Standing at the edge of the ring, she gazes over the crowd he had decided to try and hide in, not only her eyes working to detect him, but used the Force and her other senses as well. It would be hard for him to mask the sound and glow of his saber unless he turned it off and those he was using as shields likely would not want to linger.

**"Hey, where's he going?! He can't do that! Can he do that?!?"
"Haha, the little exhaust port ran! Pay up Chapper!"**
The sound of Ash's footsteps fades into the crowd as he beats a seeming retreat. Wexal and Depik roll to their sides to allow him to pass, Depik with an overly enthusiastic wave, and when he's fully amidst the throng, it's as if the crowd were some singular entity conspiring to keep the waspish youth concealed.
Adalyn dispels the lingering shimmers of mist, and when she does she finds Ash nowhere in sight. Drawing upon the force, she extends her senses from the center of the dueling ring to encompass the entirety of the atrium, and as she does so free-floating tendrils of light blossom within her mind's eye, each one representing a life force within the immediate area. With them comes the various senses of anger, confusion, and amusement rolling off various members of the crowd, but suddenly her mind sharpens and focuses on one aura in particular: Ash's.
When the Padawan opens her eyes, the spectators appear hazy to her eye while Ash stands out almost fully-defined and in stark relief to the crowd. Here and there the wily initiate uses the force to goose and jostle the onlookers, hoping to divert Adalyn's attention, but he does not quite escape Adalyn's Force-honed perceptions. Wherever Ash moves, Adalyn follows, until the Padawan is at the edge of the dueling ring shadowing Ash's every step. The crowd edges warily away from glow of her lightsaber.

---

Master Ruhk watches the turn of events with the same implacable expression, although a slight quirk of his brow signals his surprise. A tall figure filters through the crowd behind the Jedi master- the scarred Padawan. In the empty ring beyond the crowd stands a stack of rocks in an impossibly-balanced, one-two-one pattern. It would appear that the Padawan finally worked out whatever it is that he needed to work out.
**"How goes the sparring master?"
"Differently, Khol. Differently."**
Khol grunts in amusement, but says nothing more, as he looks into the ring to see just how differently the match was going. He frowns as he sees only Adalyn, but a moments concentration reveals Ash's life force weaving through the crowd, and the Padawan's eyes widen in first surprise, then understanding. Setting his feet, Khol settles in to watch the rest of the spar, his curiosity piqued.

*Carefully Ash, carefully.*
The young Jedi trainee pushes his Force ability to its limits as he soothes or disorienting members of the crowd during his passage Each individual requires a slightly different emotional or mental manipulation in order to prevent them giving away his position. He finds the task taxing but not impossible, this sort of Force use being part of the day-to-day experience for a Fallanassi initiate. He has not let those skills go rusty, practicing regularly - wherever and whenever he thinks he can get away with it.
Soon it becomes apparent that his tactic has only partially worked. He's safe from Adalyn, at least until she decides to risk bringing the melee into the crowd. But she clearly knows where he is, stalking him as he moves around the ring.
*Time to shake things up again.*
Ash smiles and gives Adalyn a little wave of acknowledgement with his right hand while his left drops to his utility belt, clicks open a compartment, and takes hold of the object inside.
He waits for a few seconds, standing at ease and apparently in no rush to go anywhere.
Then his hand whips up with remarkable speed and in the blink of an eye a brightly lit halo lamp whizzes toward's Adalyn's face.

---

Move action to withdraw halo lamp.
Swift to activate it.
Standard action to Feint (ie. distracting/dazzling her with the halo lamp) as per the Deception skill; +8 (since he isn't rushed or threatened I would argue it's possible to Take 10 on this one? I won't kick up a fuss if you rule otherwise though.) Note that the feint will occur right at the end of the round and if it works will cause Adalyn to be flat-footed in *my* next round so if it works this would need to be accounted for in your posts.

Adalyn follows Ash’s movements from the edge of the ring, her lightsaber at ease beside her as she gets nearer to the edge. The observing bystanders shy away as she doesso, but that suits her just fine. It allows her to get closer to her young opponent hiding in the midst of the crowd
As he stops she takes the opportunity. *Why go into the crowd, when I can bring him to me?* she asks herself. With the thought, a devilish smile forms; a hint of the young woman she used to be. Drawing on her innate power, she concentrates on his form within the Force intending on picking him up to hover a couple meters above the crowd and bring him back toward the center of the ring, dropping him from the height in the hopes of off balancing him, but not necessarily hurting him in the process.
Moving towards him, she doesn’t intend on letting him near the crowd to hide again. “**Nice move, Peztar,** ” she starts. “**The bystanders are lucky I’m not out to get you at any cost.**” With that she raises her blade, back into a fighting stance.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Standard Use the Force for Move Object +13; raise him up 1 sq and move him up to 5 sq to get him as close to the center of the ring, or at least to the other side of me. I’ll let him fall which will hopefully cause him to go prone.
Move action to get adjacent to him.
This is of course my intention provided I’m not dazzled first. I’ll spend a FP as needed.

**"And if you were?"**
Master Ruhk's voice cuts through the din of the crowd, causing more than a few heads to turn in his direction. Although the volume of his voice has not changed, his question is much sharper and challenging, demanding an answer. His eyes lock onto Adalyn as she continues to shadow Ash, his gaze deep and waiting.
**"The Jedi's first duty is service to the Force. The Force is the essence of every living thing; so by extension the Jedi's first duty is to life itself. What would you do, Padawan Pallax, if 'bystanding' life comes between you, and your objective?"**

---

Ash chooses the exact moment that Master Ruhk completes his last question to spring into action, a halo lamp appearing in his hand at the flick of his wrist, which he then uses to flash a beam of bright white light directly into Adalyn's eyes. With little time to think, Adalyn seizes the Force and sweeps her hand toward Ash, and then back behind her towards the center of the ring in wild fashion. Several surprised exclamations erupt from the crowd as the dark-haired youth goes hurtling from their midst to skid across the sandy dueling pit to land unceremoniously in its center. Adalyn then staggers flat-footed towards the center of the ring, blinking and scrubbing feverishly to clear the bright, circular after-images from her vision. **(Damage to Ash: 11 pts)**

---

**"Bit more inventive this time. That lamp trick is new."
"Mhmph."**
Master Ruhk doesn't seem overly inclined to agree with Khol, and Khol for his part doesn't press the issue any further. Both continue to stare out over the match, Master Ruhk expecting both learners to answer his questions, while lumbering youth hopes that his friends don't harm one another too badly.

Yanked off his feet almost at the same instance he releases the halo lamp - *and thank the Force I was quicker off the mark* - Ash feels the breath escaping from him as the unseen power of Adalyn's ability encloses around his chest and hurls him bodily through the air. He grits his teeth, unwilling to give his opponent or the audience the satisfaction of any kind of exclamation. Something like this hadn't been entirely unexpected anyway, though admittedly he hadn't been prepared for how it would feel.
He sprawls across the hard floor face upward and a thousand points of pain blossom across his shoulders and back causing a grunt of pain despite himself. The youth doesn't let this stop him though, reaching behind himself to plant his hands and push off the floor, flipping agilely to his feat.
To his immense satisfaction Ash discovers that his own tactic was effective: Adalyn moves unsurely toward him, blinking against the after-images caused by his halo lamp.
This is the opportunity he wants, and probably the only opportunity he'll get before the older padawan ends the fight. Determined to claim a small victory on his own terms, he lunges forward, coming in low under her hampered guard, igniting his saber and striking out at the hilt of the training saber in her hands.

Master’s Ruhk’s voice booms over to her, but she doesn’t have much of an opportunity to answer him as Ash puts her on her guard once more. The light sent her way had blinded her for an instant, the light imprinting in her eyes and obscuring her vision with an array of spots. Instinctively, she raises her right hand to rub at her eyes, but only when nothing happens does she realize her folly. Instead, blinking through the dazzling lights in her vision she makes her way toward her adversary, her lightsaber held out at the ready to meet him. She’s forgotten that Master Ruhk would expect her to answer him, her full concentration going back to the fight.
*I don’t need my vision to fight him*, she thinks to herself, and taking a calming breath she closes her eyes, allowing her other senses and her trust in the Force to take over. As a youngling she had been taught not to trust in her eyes, but in the Force. It was one of the first things a youngling learned upon being given a lightsaber. She hears his saber ignite, a preamble to an attack she knew.
Using her own agility she throws herself forward to roll and come up on Ash’s other side, her saber swinging where her senses tell her Ash will be. It was almost a flamboyant maneuver, but she was tired of playing games.

Ash rolls onto his shoulders and plants his hands, using the momentum from the maneuver to hand-spring to his feet. As he does, a sensation warns Adalyn through the Force, and she spins with a rising cut that is meant to catch Ash through the collarbone. The dark-haired youth feels the muted heat of the plasma blade wash over his face as it blurs past, singing some hair from the top of his head but leaving his no worse for wear. **(Acrobatics check successful, no AoO)**
The long-handled lightsaber hums to life as Ash pounces like an angry Bha'lir cub, his intent to sunder Adalyn's training saber. Time seems to slow for the two, and all else fades to obscurity as the brilliant blue blade inches towards the hilt of its antagonist. At the last possible moment, Adalyn's vision seems to clear and with the threat looming she releases her grip on her lightsaber with a spinning flourish, and Ash's blade only manages to scourge a blackened furrow through it's metallic finish. **(Rolled a 17 on sunder attempt, miss)**
As Ash goes lunging by, Adalyn collides with his shoulder and attains a grip at the base of his neck with her now-free hand and then uses his entire body like a springboard to push herself up and away from the Initiate in a spinning somersault. The momentum from Ash's attempt on her lightsaber causes the green-bladed saber to go tumbling backwards over the initiates head in the same arc, and when Adalyn lands the lightsaber falls into her outstretched hand. **(Acrobatics check successful, no AoO)**
Spinning desperately, Ash brings his lightsaber around in a whistling two-handed slash, but he is off-balance and in a dire position. Adalyn neatly ducks under the offending swipe and comes up within Ash's guard with a slice that, if these lightsabers were fully focused, would have dissected him from right hip to left shoulder. Every nerve-ending in Ash's body becomes blazing torrent of pain and misfiring synaptic information, leaving him sizzling, slumping, and barely standing in the center of the dueling pit. **(Damage to Ash: 8 pts, -2 on CT)**
**"Hold! This match is concluded."**

---

Master Ruhk trundles forward, his heavy footsteps leaving deep in impressions in the sandy dueling pit. Padawan Khol trails the massive Feeorin, and from the surrounding throng comes a chorus of cheers, boos, and muttered curses as credits exchange hands.
**"You showed impressive cunning, and improvisation against a more skilled opponent Ash. You played to your strengths and sought to disarm Adalyn; remove the threat, not the man. That was good thinking, and shows that you are progressing."**
The Jedi Master flashes a very rare grin, no more than a slight up-turning at the lips, and the corners of his deep, violet eyes crinkle with amusement. But even though he appears in good spirits, when next he speaks there is durasteel-hard sternness to his tone.
**"But you showed cunning and ingenuity at the possible expense of those innocents surrounding you. Although this is practice, it is certainly not a game, and you risked bystanders for a slight advantage. For this, you will personally repair any damage you may have inflicted on Padawan Pallax's lightsaber, and the resources to do so will come from your own credits. Should you not have enough, you will work until you do."**
He then turns his gaze upon Adalyn. Behind the master, Khol turns a look on Ash that is some small part sympathetic, but mostly barely restrained good-humor.
**"And I still await an answer from you Adalyn. Strength is meaningless without focus and care. I will give you some time to think upon it, but should your answer be unsatisfactory you will work penance until you achieve enlightenment."**
With his lecture complete, Master Ruhk turns and lumbers back over to his garden. The crowd surrounding the dueling pit has begun to disperse, and a trio of Younglings rushes towards Khol, Ash, and Adalyn, each youngling carrying a cup of cold water. Depik offers her cup to Khol, while Wexal and Jyzen offer theirs to Adalyn and Ash respectively. Jyzen takes a moment to fan away the curling tendrils of evaporated sweat rising off of Ash, Depik chatters excitedly about the match and anything else that comes across her mind, and in a few short moments the small Jedi family is standing in the center of the ring by themselves.

Despite the pain that consumes his body and the damage to his robes, and despite yet another defeat at the hands of his self-declared rival, Ash is smiling as Ruhk approaches. He knows that he's conducted himself well.
His smile broadens as the Master praises him, but as the sentence falls his expression turns to one of confusion and hurt. He opens his mouth to reply, to explain why Master Ruhk is wrong , but the Feeorian has already began talking to Adalyn. Feeling impotent anger, Ash catches Khol's eye, the padawan gazing at him with sympathy. He shrugs feebly in a poor pretence of calm, then looks away.
Accepting the glass of water from Jyzen, Ash mumbles his thanks, but he doesn't meet the younger boy's eye. In fact he doesn't seem in the mood to mingle with the others and walks away, glass in hand. He moves awkwardly, the shocks of pain as he takes his steps causing him to limp falteringly. Gritting his teeth he carries on, heading resolutely toward his room.

Her adrenaline continues to course through Adalyn’s body and only her self control stops her from ending the fight completely as Master Ruhk calls the halt. Stepping back, she takes a staggering breath that she didn’t realize she had been holding. As Ruhk lumbers over to them, she gives Ash a salute before clipping her training saber she had claimed to her belt next to her normal use. She had been pleased to discover the weight of this one matched very closely to the saber Ruhk had given her.
She gave Ash a nod, the praise was well deserve as he had indeed fought well if a bit unorthodox and she found herself agreeing with their master as he lectured Ash the dire flaw of his use of it.
It wasn’t long before he turned to her with his own lecture, and she nodded to him. She would indeed reflect on it, but she supposed she would do what she had, locating and isolating her target. She would do what she could to protect the bystanders unless it became apparent they were more at risk for her opponent to be at large. Not answering right away, she decided she would take the time Master Ruhk was providing her and reflect on the quandary.
During her reflection, Master Ruhk had made his way back to his garden and the younglings he fostered clambered up, surrounding she, Khol and Ash. Gratefully she takes the proffered glass of water from the Arconan giving the youngling a rare smile of thanks before taking small sips. It was never good to down water quickly after such an excursion. Half listening to Depik as she talks excitedly, not that the youngling was easy to follow when she got going, Adalyn watched as Ash walked away from the group. Sullen seemed an understatement for the mood he was in now and as he limped away, she felt bad for the wounds she had given him.
Hesitating for a moment, Adalyn soon too excuses herself from the group, following after Ash. Knowing she may not be wanted, she still wanted to attempt the peace offering. She easily catches up to the limping youth and for a long moment she’s quiet. “**I know you don’t want me here, but I’m here regardless. I’d like to help you if you’d let me.**” Looking straight ahead, she gives him a sidelong glance to see his reaction. The offer seemed silly coming from a crippled young woman, who seemed hardly whole.

For long seconds Ash doesn't reply, his jaw set. Then deciding he can't ignore her forever, he acknowledges her somewhat mulishly with a reply:
'There's nothing to help with.'
There's another pregnant pause, though before long he speaks up again, the pent up frustration gushing out.
'I knew you wouldn't hurt anybody. That was part of my strategy; everyone was perfectly safe because you wouldn't hurt them to get to me and I took advantage of that. It was a good plan that suited the circumstances and it's not the *same* as a real fight. I wouldn't have done it in a real fight. Master Ruhk was wrong.'
By the end Ash sounds less angry and more disappointed - his hero, in his eyes, has proven himself fallible.
The young lad sighs, and holds out his hand.
'Give me the lightsaber then, I'll go repair it.'

### **Alicia** (2011-06-18 19:35:39)

Adalyn is quiet adding to the pregnant silence while she takes in his rant, her pace matching his limping gait. "Master Ruhk likes to test us. While this was a practice and you believed you knew how I was to react, there's always the possibility that your opponent won't act like you expect. Case in point the stunt you did. I expected you to act like you had in our previous spar, your stunt catching me off guard.
"If you had been wrong those people could have been in danger, and their lives would be your responsibility," she sighs. "Admittably if you had posed a greater threat, I would have sacrificed them to protect others." Slowly she unclips her training saber from her belt. Before she let's him take it however she says, "Let me treat your wounds... I know enough to at least lessen the sting."

Ash listens to what Adalyn has to say and, albeit begrudgingly, he has to admit there's some sense in what she says.
'Next time I'll remember that you could turn out to be a raving psychopath then,' he comments with a playful grin.
'I'm fine, really, my dad used to tell me "pain is a lesson to avoid being hit". Besides it'll be a good opportunity to practice that trance technique Master Ruhk showed me. How are your eyes?'
The last question slips out in a tone of genuine concern, after which Ash coughs, arranges his face in a carefully blank expression and faces ahead again.

"A pshychopath rarely believes she's at fault," Adalyn says, joking back at him. She then let's him have the saber, not forcing the issue in treating his wounds, she was hardly one to talk. Both of them working through the pain in their own way. Unfortunately hers wouldn't heal with meditation alone.
His concern earns him an amused glance. "Still a little blurry," she replies looking straight ahead. She was finding it hard to see in the darker corridors, her eyes taking longer to adjust than usual and she was resisting then urge to rub them. "Some rest will probably put it to rights."

Ash takes the weapon in hand and cursorily inspects the damage. He's pleased to see it's mostly superficial; although damaging it had made sense during the duel he would have felt guilty if he'd actually destroyed as wonderful a piece of tech as a lightsaber. Not to mention his relief that repairs shouldn't be too difficult.
He clips the weapon to his belt alongside his own saber while listening to Adalyn's assessment of the condition of your eyes.
'Sorry,' he apologises gruffly, 'I hope you feel better soon.'

"**Thanks…**" she starts, and stopping she turns to face him. "**I'm sorry too for your injuries. I hope it doesn't take you too long to recover.**" Her head turns toward the direction they had come. "**I'd best go meditate on Master Ruhk's question. He'd probably give me penance for making him wait.**" She shrugs then, looking back at her younger companion. "**Rest well,**" she says after a long moment, and then she turns to head towards her own room.
Opening the door to her room, she glanced into the sparse quarters given to her since she had left the infirmary of the Churunthur where she had spent some time recovering from her injuries after Ruhk had brought her back from the brink of death. The room consisted of her small bed and a desk and chair. An assortment of parts was carefully laid out on the surface of the desk from when she had been inspecting the potential parts for use on her future lightsaber.
After showering and changing into a spare set of clothes she sat on the floor next to her bed, entering the deep trance used for meditation. She reflected on Ruhk's question, knowing full well he would want an answer next she saw him, but her thoughts didn't linger on that quandary as her thoughts became disturbed her own perpetual questions.

Ash nods to Adalyn and continues on his way. As he walks he suddenly remembers the glass of water in his hand and takes a gulp, the clear cold liquid soothing the dryness in his throat.
He is definitely calmer now, and in fact the more he thinks about it the more he's inclined to see his "punishment" as a blessing in disguise. Thanks to the excuse of repairing this lightsaber he now has an opportunity to take it apart and take note of the mechanisms inside, giving him plenty of time to start developing the components for his own weapon and even to put some thought to improving the design. When Master Ruhk declares Ash ready to build his own, he *will* be ready.
The young Jedi is actually smiling by the time he reaches his room, a cramped little space with furnishings that can only be described as "crowded". On the right side of the chamber his thin bunk rests flush against the wall, the door to his personal refresher unit adjacent to its foot and at right angles to the entrance. Along the left side of the room are several storage lockers, shelving units, and squeezed into the corner nearest the door a chair and desk where he keeps his tools and works on smaller projects: his workshop. Enough space runs through the centre of the room to walk single file provided a person isn't too broad, and against the far wall this walkway leads to is a tall mirror, the reflection of which, from certain angles, seems to extend the size of the room.
Ash puts the glass down on his desk then changes out of his damaged black and robes and into his spare white set, tossing the discarded clothes messily onto his bunk. He cursorily inspects the damage to himself in the mirror, noting that he's going to have some nasty bruises for a day or two. Concern for himself thus acknowledged it can now be ignored completely, and he promptly sits at his desk and inspects the lightsaber to assess the actual damage. Ash makes use of his bracer computer as he does so, researching materials and costs and making notes and schematics of the device as he takes it apart. He also slots in a blank datacard, in order that he can back up the saved research files and schematics.

Mechanics +7; I'm guessing I don't really need to roll for these uses of a computer?

## Re: Act I: Descending into Darkness

### **Anazider** (2011-06-20 00:06:06)

Ash runs a search on his bracer computer, it uplinks to the greater library on the floating Jedi Academy, and a deluge of parts, schematics, and design theories begins to flood across the miniature screen. It doesn't take long for Ash to settle on a list of components to repair the case of the lightsaber, and a design that would make it slightly more durable, although it will cost the young Jedi some choice pieces of his scrap collection. **(100 credits from resources)**
It is little over an hour into the repair, and Ash has become so engrossed in the job that he does not realize that the entry chime to his dorm has beeping for several moments. When he moves to open it he finds Khol looming outside, and the tall Padawan has to duck his head just within the entrance to be able to make eye contact with Ash.
**"Master received new orders: the Chu'unthor will meet with a squadron of MedStar frigates in deep space, and then we'll break off with the taskforce and escort the squadron to New Holstice. We leave at 0500 galactic standard."**
If Ash looks at his chronometer, he will know that to complete his project so that it is ready for the morning he will have to work the rest of the night, leaving him only three-to-four hours of sleep if he is lucky. He also knows that the information Khol just relayed could just have easily been relayed through the comm system, and did not require a personal visit. Which means that Khol wants something, and judging by the way the Korrunai leans against the wall and quirks his eyebrow at Ash, it was likely to talk. Although his face seems flushed a deep bronze (or is that a blush?), he seems genuinely concerned for Ash's well being.
**"You all right?"**

---

***Ten minutes before Khol calls at Ash's door…***
Questions race through Adalyn's mind, a myriad of personal quandaries and existential entanglements that rush towards her in the warm void of her meditation, only to slip away into the ether as she seeks to grasp the answers. As her mind's eye draws closer to the answer that she seeks, an enlightenment through the Force, a buzzing of the entry chime at her door pulls her from the verge of understanding and thrusts her fully back into awareness of her small dorm.
When Adalyn goes to answer the door, she finds Khol standing just outside. He has to hunch slightly to make eye-contact with Adalyn through the door, although he doesn't seem so comfortable as to allow himself to lounge in the doorway. For some reason the dark-skinned Padawan appears fidgety, although this is starkly at odds with his normal quiet self-assurance.
**"I, uh… That is to say *we*- the master, you, me, Ash and the Clan- have a new mission… In the m-morning! So make sure to be ready!"**
Flashing a shy smile that quickly turns into a grimace, Khol raises his hands in a placating gesture to ward off any insult.
**"That ain't to say you won't be ready! Because you always are! Haha… Oh by the Force…"**
Khol combs a hand through his braids as he looks down at the floor, setting the cowerie shells at the tips of the braids to clacking and clinking musically. Adalyn realizes that this may be the most she's heard the other Padawan say in perhaps a week or more, and she never seems to hear him this jumbled of tongue or thought with Master Ruhk's other students.
**"You're… All right, aren't you? You and Ash always seem to go at it tougher than you either of you ever do with me. He… he didn't hurt you or anything, did he?"**
The Padawan then looks up and affixes Adalyn with a gaze that is vibrant with concern, and some adolescent murmur of some other emotion. He seems on the verge of launching into some sort of defense, or explanation for Ash, but he anxiously holds back until Adalyn replies. As with many others, his eyes stray to the rolled-up sleeve of Adalyn's missing arm, if only once, but instead of pity or apprehension, there is only the genuine concern.

## Re: Act I: Descending into Darkness

### **Alicia** (2011-06-20 00:37:09)

A frustrated sigh escapes her lips as the door’s chime penetrates her meditation. Adalyn could swear she had been close to the epiphany she sought, but apparently she hadn’t been quite ready for the revelation.
At first annoyed at the interruption, she’s then surprised to see that it’s Khol standing outside her door. Usually it was a youngling or two, wanting to divulge their latest scheme. Attempting to mask her surprise at seeing him, she couldn’t help but give a small at his stuttering antics, something she couldn’t help to admit she found somewhat cute. She hadn’t yet been able to place whether he was just unused to having girls close to his age around, or whether her peer had a crush on her. Whatever the case, this was the most he had really said to her. They had never really spoken when they’d been set to spar by Ruhk.
Finishing his confabulation, she stands aside motioning for him to come in. He seemed rather uncomfortable looming in the short doorway, though the thought came to her that perhaps he may have been more comfortable outside of it. Once he enters, she moves past him, noting the look he gives her missing arm – she’d noticed many people seemed to stare at it, often with pity. Taking a seat on her bed, she let him take the desk chair.
“**No… he didn’t. My vision has already cleared, though I fear I did him more harm than he did me.**” She cocked her head at him curiously and added, “**Thanks for your concern, Khol. Did you work out what you needed to in Master Ruhk’s garden?**” The last she asked sheepishly, looking down at her feet.

Ash listens to the news thoughtfully and does indeed look at the chronometer. He decides to work through the night - along with his wounds this provides the perfect opportunity to attempt the Force trance technique. If successful he should not only recover from the worst of the pain but also have just enough time to emerge from the trance feeling fully rested. Of course if he fails he'll not only be tired but also still in pain, which is bound to make him cranky. The possibility of failure doesn't really concern him though, it not really occurring to him to allow for it.
He smiles at Khol's concern. It's touching really, the older boy endeavouring to fulfil the responsibilities of the brotherly roles that have developed between them.
'I'm over it,' Ash replies jovially, apparently in a much better mood than he had been when he left the duel, 'though I'll have to repurpose some of the parts I was saving for our project. Sorry.'
He looks at the Korunnai, taking note of his flushed features, which causes him to grin wickedly. He has an idea he wasn't the first to receive a visit from the concerned padawan.
'Was *she* all right?' He teases.

---

## Re: Act I: Descending into Darkness

### **Anazider** (2011-06-20 23:31:59)

Khol nods and relaxes a bit further as Ash reassures him. He relaxes so much that when the younger Jedi teases him, Khol doesn't appear to notice as his eyes take on a far away look.
**"She's *great*, especially that smile she gets when- "**
Suddenly cutting short with his mouth agape, Khol blinks twice before attempting to cover the momentary lapse in control with a ragged cough. The lumbering Padawan pushes himself away from where he leans as he recovers from the exaggerated cough, and as he runs his gaze around the room he seems to focus on everything else except for Ash's smirking face.
**"Adalyn's fine! Your fine, I'm fine, we're all fine! Everything is fine! Uh, you probably want to get some rest before the mission, I will go."**
Khol moves to beat a hasty retreat from the room, and as he does the overgrown manchild threatens to topple a couple of Ash's neatly stacked shelves. The Korunnai just barely manages to catch the shelves, whether physically or through some trick of the Force. As he sets the last one aright, he nods quickly to Ash and then crosses the threshold out, although he pauses and turns slightly back into the room.
**"You won't tell'er what I said, will you?"**
Although Khol's tone is pleading, there's a distinct undertone that promises swift retribution should word reach Adalyn. While the older Padawan was far removed from being a bully, it was well known that he in fact despised the sort, he was still rather effective at making his displeasure known, and more importantly *felt*. Khol played the part of the surrogate older brother well.

---

Khol gives the fiber-grown chair a few testing pats, and after finding a position that wouldn't send him crashing through it, the Korunnai reclines slightly. When Adalyn asks him about his training, he once again smiles shyly and rakes his hand through his braids, although this time the gesture serves to move his padawan braid out of his eyes.
**"Master Ruhk says that a Jedi in harmony with the Force can find beauty in all things, even bunch of rocks. I had my doubts, so Master told me to move the rocks around until I found something beautiful."**
He stares down towards the floor, his hands bracing out to either arm of the chair so as to prevent his full weight from being at the chair's center. The darkened youth begins to speak again but hesitates, sneaking a glance up at Adalyn as if he's unsure if he has said too much already, before he lowers his eyes and continues, his padawan braid falling errant again.
**"I've never been good at meditating like I should- I can't seem to get quiet enough to focus. But when I'm moving, or working with my hands, everything seems to make sense, like it all falls into place. Master says he was the same way; its our way of working things out."**
The words almost all come out in a rush, like pressure release blown off the valve, but from Khol it's a steady, ponderous flow, as if he is working out his thoughts with each sentence. At the end he sneaks another glance at Adalyn, and regardless of her response Khol looks stricken, as if he's said a great deal more than he had intended to say. He quickly rises to his feet, the small fiber-grown chair groaning with the sudden movement, and Khol moves with a care greater than even his considerable height would require as he begins to make his way to the door.
**"I'm sorry, that probably all sounded really spacebrained. You probably want to rest before the mission, I should go. I'll go."**

---

## Re: Act I: Descending into Darkness

### **Alicia** (2011-06-21 00:53:25)

Adalyn listens to what Khol has to say, the first time he’d put full, non stuttering sentences together directed at her. Remembering the impossibly balanced rock structure he had left, she could see how it could be beautiful, a work of art. She looks up at him, glad that for once he’s able to hold a conversation and that he’d decided to open up to her. For a moment, she was jealous of his ability to find harmony within himself, his questions answered. Lately, they remained just out of her grasp. Her own inner turmoil often left her feeling dissatisfied after her meditations.
She looks up as she hears the groan of the chair as he rises. As he begins to move carefully toward the door, it’s easy for her to reach out, grabbing him by the wrist with her left hand before he’s able to leave her completely. “**Khol…**” she starts, the sentence forming before she really knew what she wanted to say. Looking up she catches his gaze. “**Thanks for coming by. It means a lot to me…**” Realizing she was still holding onto his wrist, she let’s go and looks away for a moment.
“**I saw the rock sculpture… It did turn out beautifully,** ” she says, blushing slightly before looking down again. Quickly she tries to cover the exhibition and hope the darkened room prevents him from seeing.
Clearing her throat slightly and looking over at him once more she asks, “**You said we had a mission, but you didn’t give specifics. What time are we heading out?** ”

'I promise not to say a word,' Ash replies, raising his hand to his heart. Then as Khol walks off he bursts out laughing.
*Well well.*
Shaking his head, he returns his attention to the repairs of the lightsaber and completes the repairs.
Finally finished in the small hours of the morning, Ash sits on his mattress cross-legged and slows his breathing, focusing internally and attempting to apply Master Ruhk's lessons and enter into a recuperative Force trance.
Failing that, of course, he'll just go to bed and get what little rest he can.

### **Anazider** (2011-06-22 01:59:57)

Khol nods firmly, Ash's word always having been good enough for him, and then he departs in a hurry. Ash is able to return to his work, and after many hours he finally reseals the casing to the training lightsaber, his work complete. The scoring has been completely repaired, and now the overall design of the lightsaber is slightly more sturdy, assuring that his previous strategy against Adalyn will likely not work a second time. **(+1 to DR)**
With his work finished, and the remaining hours until he must be awake quickly fading, Ash settles in the middle of his to meditate. At first the shifting-nature of the bed and the cross-legged position almost unbalances him, but soon he has attained a trance-like state, the Force enveloping and flowing through him more fully and taking away his aches and weariness. Ash meditates peacefully, awash in the ebb and flow of the galaxy, until the it is time to make ready for the mission.

---

The gangly Korunnai could likely have drug the diminutive Adalyn all around the ship, but the grip she places on Khol's wrist stops him more surely than the most powerful tractor beam. Adalyn briefly feels the muscles of Khol's arm tense, a reflexive reaction to the grab, and beneath her hand she can feel the rough edges of a deep scar. When she looks into his eyes, there is a brief flash of an almost feral anger, and perhaps fear, but it all-but instantly evaporates when Adalyn thanks Khol and compliments his sculpture.
**"I-It was j-just a stack of rocks… But th-thank you."**
Khol then attempts turns away from Adalyn with the excruciatingly obvious fake cough imaginable, all in an attempt to hide the ferocity of his blush. He does this almost all the way to the door, but when Adalyn asks about the mission he turns around slowly, the look on his face confused as if he had forgotten the original pretense for why he had come to her room in the first place. Suddenly, his eyes go wide and he shakes his head as if to clear himself from a daze.
**"0500 Galactic Standard- escort duty for a MedStar squadron on its way to New Holstice. Probably take on more med supplies and troopers when we get there."**
Khol looks down at his feet, and when Adalyn catches a glimpse of his face she finds the picture of thoughtfulness and solemnity looking back at her. Many of those onboard the *Chu'unthor II* that weren't truly familiar with the lumbering youth thought him to be slow-witted, or simple, but such quick judgments completely obscures the truth: Khol liked to ponder, and plan everything through before acting, moving thoroughly to the heart of a matter rather than be concerned with the tangle of its details.
**"Master Ruhk likes to challenge you; make you question what's at the core of you, to better yourself. If you can honestly answer why you want to be a Jedi, for yourself, you can answer any question he'll give you. I hope that helps, if you're still looking for answers. Rest well."**
With one last bow, Khol departs and leaves Adalyn to her own reflections as the night ticks away.

---

The night passes without further interruption, and when Ash and Adalyn awake they find a message waiting on the comm units in their rooms, indicating that they are to meet in launch bay A42 for their mission. After necessary grooming and change of dress, it doesn't take long to negotiate the familiar maze of hallways of the floating Jedi Academy to access bay A-42.
Bay A42 was the largest of the *Chu'unthor's* docking bays, cavernous enough to house multiple shuttles, fighters, and personal craft, as well as a pair of Consular-class cruisers. All around the docking bay is a vibrant mass of activity, with platoons of clone troopers marshaling to transports, parties of dignitaries arriving for meetings onboard the academy, and the constant coming-and-going of Jedi and other Force users. As Adalyn and Ash filters through the the ever-shifting conglomeration of sentients, they find themselves receiving bows, waves, salutes, and bits of small talk, all threatening to try and keep them from making the start of their mission on time. All are well-meaning, but there is always some extra bit of anecdote, joke, or lesson that begs to keep them from finding Master Ruhk.
When finally they do find the towering Feeorin, he stands speaking with a naval officer in front of one of the the Consular-class cruisers. Idling behind him near the boarding ramp are Janders, Howler, and Switch, and flanking Master Ruhk is Khol. The three ARC troopers salute in perfect precision, and Khol gives a slight wave. Both he and Master Ruhk appear to be wearing battle armor; Khol's is modified clone trooper armor with the markings of a Jedi Commander, while Ruhk's is more archaic and hand-crafted in appearance. Judging by the number of nicks and blast-scarring adorning each, both sets of armor have been put to extensive use.
Master Ruhk waves Adalyn and Ash over, and as they approach they recognize the naval officer as Captain Yothku, the Kadas'sa'Nikto commander of the *Chu'unthor's* spacefaring operations and its contingent of veteran Republic personnel. Captain Yothku gives his thin-lipped approximation of a brilliant smile when he notices the two young Jedi, and when Ash and Adalyn have joined the small group, Master Ruhk opens his mouth to speak before he is suddenly interrupted by a loud banging and a spluttered litany of curses in Dug. Just as suddenly, Clan Zakkeg goes sprinting right through the middle of Master Ruhk's gathering, then between the three ARC troopers and up the boarding ramp, with Buthbo tripping and squeaking the whole way and Wexal shrieking before they disappear into the cruisers depths.
**"We ain't do nothin', honest!"**
Staring after the younglings for a long moment, Master Ruhk merely harumphs and shakes his head before returning his attention to the others.
**"We'll take the *Aegis*, since we'll need the additional cargo space for the two Mobile Surgical Units we're picking up. When we arrive, I will deal with the paperwork while you,"** as he says this, the Jedi Master indicates Khol, Adalyn, then Ash, **"will go to meet with the commander of the Rimsoo unit, and then bring him and his personnel back to the ship. Questions?"**

### **simplyscribed** (2011-06-22 08:25:50)

Ash stirs from his Force trance feeling adequately rested, if not completely on form: a little pain and some stiffness remains to remind him of yesterday’s duel. He rises, dresses, and equips himself with no preamble and is soon leaving his quarters behind him, Adalyn’s lightsaber clipped to his utility belt.
He passes as fluidly as possible through the hanger bay, greeting those who acknowledge him cordially and carefully masking his impatience. In reality he just wants to get going: while the mission may well be a blue milk run (and he feels it must be or Master Ruhk would never take the younglings), it is still good to feel he’s to be part of *something* and he’s eager to start as soon as possible.
Upon arrival at the ramp of the *Aegis*, he bows to Master Ruhk and Captain Yothku, returns the salute of the commandos, and nods in greeting to Khol and Adalyn, to the latter of which he mutely passes her lightsaber. The weapon is not only repaired but has also had its casing entirely replaced with a more durable material which nevertheless retains an equivalent weight and balance to its original design. She sees that it will be even harder now to damage the weapon, a peculiar consideration from the young man who had attempted to do so in the first place and might reasonably be expected to attempt it again.
When the proceedings are interrupted by an unexpected clamour Ash isn’t surprised when the younglings of Clan Zakkeg fly by and onto the vessel, and aside from a raised eyebrow and the barest twitch of a smirk he doesn’t react.
‘I have no questions,’ he answers Ruhk’s question, ‘provided Khol has already been given the necessary information.’
He naturally assumes that the senior padawan is to take charge of their task.

The look in his eyes almost makes her shy away for a moment, and the feel of his rough, scarred skin beneath hers sparks a moment of curiosity and worry. Then his expression changes and he becomes his normal tongue tied self. Looking down she doesn’t see his own blush as he heads for the door, though his coughing fit causes her to look up and then away as he turns to answer her question. Glancing over at the chronometer she realizes she has the rest of the evening to herself. It could be a long night.
Khol’s statement as he departs leaves Adalyn so speechless she barely got in a ‘good night’ before he disappeared completely, the door closing behind him. Adalyn’s thoughts continue to race as she changes for bed. The task requiring a great deal more focus than it once would have required - the fingers of her left hand stumble over buttons and knots in her feeble attempts. She still isn’t use to dressing with one hand and since she has an early morning, she doesn’t bother to remove all of her clothing, just falling into the bed half dressed in her undershirt, pants and boots.
Sleep was hardly going to come easily so she didn’t try, instead slipping into the Force Trance. *Answer for myself why I want to be a Jedi… Is it really so simple?* Khol had told her something she had already known – Master Ruhk’s habit of pushing and testing his young charges – but was the answers she had been seeking as easy as validating her reasoning for being a Jedi?
At the core, this was really the only life Adalyn knew how to lead. She had been a young child, weaned and walking, curious about her surroundings when her parents had sent her to the temple, hoping under the protection of the Jedi their three children would find sanctuary from their enemies. During her young life she had been groomed for the inevitable choice of joining the ranks of the Jedi Order. The choice validated when, unlike her sisters, she had been chosen to be apprenticed by a Jedi Master.
Her only taste of what her life would have been like came a couple years into her apprenticeship. Master Ta, believing it important the young Jedi knew where she came from, traveled to the Pelagon the capital of the House she had been born into. At first she was ostracized, her Tapani peers judging her worthiness based upon the state of her clothing, but after some encouragement from Master Ta she was able to ingratiate herself into their good graces. From them she learned the finer points of Tapani life, most of them the hard way as she made one faux pas after another. In the end, she found her peers to be egocentric, using their hereditary position for their own means rather than the good of the Tapani people.
Once, a young Adalyn had been told that the power a Jedi possessed came with the greater responsibility of using it to protect those who didn’t. With the power came the hard lesson that to use it for the wrong reasons, a great price would have to be paid. While she had never quite understood the lesson as a child, the words had been instilled in her. Now that she was older, she was learning how severe the consequences could be. The momentous lesson having occurred just a few mere months ago. Not for the first time she asks herself, *Why have I survived? Why did he save me?* While she had wanted to live, there was the moments as she felt her men and her master join the Force she had been prepared to join them, her own life force slipping away. Only the process had been stopped by the revitalizing energy and determination of Master Ruhk.
*Why?* A pain in her hand brought her out of her trance, her nails of her remaining hand having dug into her fist drawing blood. Curling into a ball she wept, not caring if it was out of self pity or grief or even a combination of the two. The phantom pain in her right limb increases, driving the tears on. She had cried in those first days too, when she thought she had been alone and she had slept from the exhaustion of it until Master Ruhk had dragged her out of bed.
When the chronometer goes off, she sits up with a start, not realizing she had cried herself to sleep. In the mirror, the puffiness of her eyes betrays her and no amount of cold water she splashes on them seems to help. Running out of time she puts on the remainder of her clothes and makes her way to the hanger bay.
With a false cheer and barely masked impatience she makes it through the crowd to Master Ruhk’s side, meeting up with Ash and Khol. She gives the Commandos a polite nod of acknowledgement, but then, for a moment, she’s taken aback at the sight of Khol in the modified clone armor, the sight of it drawing forth unbidden memories of the last time she had worn such a set. She looks away quickly; glad she has something else to concentrate on as first Clan Zakkeg bounds their way through the hanger bay onto the cruiser – their antics for once not cheering her – and then as Master Ruhk gives them the basics of their mission. From the sounds of it, it is to be a milk run and she is glad of it.
“**No, Master,**” she echoes.

From behind Master Ruhk, Khol gives Ash a sly smile, or as sly a smile as he can manage with so earnest a face. The Jedi Master, possibly sensing Khol's amusement and Ash's assumption, grunts to himself and shakes his head slightly.
**"Khol has the details, but *you* are doing the talking. It seems these days that part of a Jedi's duty is knowing how to deal with people with a high sense of superiority, and it's about time you started learning firsthand. We'll use this as a test of how far you've come in your training- and how much further you may have to go."**
Master Ruhk's voice is its same rumbling baritone, and yet that last sentence carries a good deal of implicit weight to it. Captain Yothku offers the young Jedi a sympathetic smile for having to deal with Republic bureaucrats before he pulls an antique chronometer from a neatly-pressed pocket, and turns back to the Jedi Master.
**"We will be arriving at the jump point within the hour Master Ruhk."
"Good. Go and get situated, and make sure the younglings haven't broken anything- I'll deal with them in a moment. I have a few more things to discuss with the Captain, and then I will join you."**
After summarily dismissing the three, Master Ruhk turns and walks a few steps away with Captain Yothku where they converse in bowed silence. When Khol, Ash, and Adalyn move to board the Aegis, Janders gives Ash an approving nod, Switch claps him roughly on the shoulder in congratulations, and Howler launches into a story about some exhaust port politician, as the clone describes him, that the squad had to rescue on Malastare.

'Adalyn and I are doing the talking?' Ash asks, then seeing Khol's attempt at a sly smile broaden he adds, '*I* am doing the talking?'
He falls silent, processing this, then a smile spreads on his lips. He isn't slow to note the significance of the phrase "it's about time you started learning first hand". *A test is it? Very interesting.*
Ash also can’t fail to note the implication when Master Ruhk refrains from grouping him with the "other" younglings. He feels certain that what he had assumed was a blue milk run is actually the turning point which he has long hoped for. Providing that he acquits himself well of course.
Grinning at the clone commandos who seem to take the same interpretation of events as himself, Ash finds the possibility suddenly becoming real in his mind thanks to this implicit confirmation from the soldiers. He is surprised to note that the concept is intimidating. If only he'd woken up this morning *knowing* it would be the day that changed his life!
Following Khol up the ramp and trying to not freak out about the sudden pressure of the mission, he makes certain the younglings are behaving themselves well (at least by their own standards) then claims a seat and straps himself into the crash netting.
He sits in silence, playing through hypothetical scenarios in his head and trying to work out the optimal responses for these fantasy situations. He also tries to remember every scrap of etiquette he ever had cause to learn, and it turns out that there hasn't been a lot. Deciding that he’ll just have to rely on his common sense and intelligence to get him through, Ash settles back and awaits take-off.

Relief floods through the young woman as she takes her place beside Ruhk and her two peers, no one taking notice of the signs of the night of self pity. As Master Ruhk explains the importance of the mission, particularly to Ash, she takes a slow calming breath hiding it in with her normal breathing.
Adalyn’s relief turns into pleasure for Ash. At last the young man was going to get the opportunity he believed had been lost when she had arrived. Unfortunately he was going to have to deal with self important bureaucrats who would probably not make it easy for him. As she follows Khol and Ash onto the ship, she considers giving the young man some tips she had learned during her time with the young nobles of the Tapani – no one was filled with more self importance than they, after all.
Deciding to wait till his high from this most important of news to settle before offering her advice, she takes her seat near the enthused young Jedi. As she straps in, she can practically see the wheels turning. Deciding now was probably as good as any time she finishes securing herself before offering her aid. “**Ash,**" she starts, but then she has to grimace as the buckle proves more difficult to snap with one hand. Using a quick application of the Force she's gets the satisfying click. "**I spent nearly a year with the Tapani, I’d be happy to give you whatever help you need to prepare.**”

Ash is broken from his reverie when Adalyn sits beside him and offers her assistance. He silently considers her proposal for a few moments, then nods.
*It’s true this definitely isn’t my area of expertise,* he tells himself, *I should really hear what she has to say.*
‘Please,’ he admits, ‘that would be very helpful of you.’
The young man seems more friendly to Adalyn than usual – perhaps the knowledge that all going well he will soon be made a padawan has reduced the sting he had been feeling.

Pleased he's accepting her offer help, she eases more comfortably into her seat collecting her thoughts before she offers some key advice.
"First impression is important to them. If you get off on the wrong foot, they may be less likely to take you seriously. Its best to approach them with respect and confidence. They may see you as inferior or they may afford you some respect on the account of your training as a Jedi. The fact you're young may hamper you as they may feel slighted that they are having to go through a supposedly inexperienced and low ranking representative if they were under the impression it was Master Ruhk who would be greeting them." She pauses a moment to make sure he's following. "But as long as you remember that you're Master Ruhk's voice during the dealings and conduct yourself accordingly you will bring honor to the both of you." She gives him a reassuring smile, remembering the first time she had to deal with bureaucrats.

'I don't know a lot about honour,' Ash grumbles in response, staring at Adalyn.
Suddenly he sits a straighter in his seat, his belt and crash webbing stretching to accommodate the movement.
'How should I greet them?' he asks, 'do I bow? Offer my hand? What do I *say*? Should I know their names already?'
It seems Ash is beginning to realise just how complicated things might be for him.
'This is no blue milk run,' he laments, 'it's going to be a bloodbath.'

### **Alicia** (2011-06-23 16:04:58)

Adalyn can't help but to laugh at his lamentation. "Only of you insult them and they follow the custom of dueling." She decides not to mention what generally occurred when a Tapani aristocrat was offended.
"When you present yourself, you should bow. Shaking hands is a sign of equality where a bow is a sign of respect. The depth of the bow tends to be important. You don't want to bow too low that you set yourself as inferior but not slight so as not to offend. Knowing who you are addressing tends to be important as you can determine how much deference they will anticipate by their title."
She pauses allowing the information to soak in. "If you aren't introduced by the bureaucrat's associates then you will need to present yourself. This is when knowing who you are addressing is important." With another pause she considers the best universal introduction which he could use on a variety of persons. "For example you could say, It's a pleasure m'lord - or m'lady - to be at your service. I am Ash." She quirks her eyebrow at him hoping she's not throwing too much at him.

'"My lord"', Ash responds in frank disbelief, 'you've got to be kidding me?'
The idea of abasing himself to someone based purely on their self-declared rank rather than any actual merit they possess irks him - in his mind it's just another form of bullying and he's had quite enough of being bullied for one lifetime. He can see no difference between "I'm bigger and stronger than you so do what I want" and "I'm wealthier and from a better lineage than you so do what I want".
His distaste for the idea is extremely apparent by his expression.
'I can't do it,' he states firmly. 'Someone who deserves their title like Master Ruhk is one thing, but I don't know these people and I don't see why I should respect them more than anyone else who *didn't* happen to be born into a privileged family.'

### **Anazider** (2011-06-24 00:29:54)

The Consular-cruiser's interior retains some of its stately elegance as a former courier for diplomats, but most of the cruiser's interior has been refitted for the purposes of warfare. Where once a grand dining table sat, now stands a large holoboard surrounded by innumerable charts and graphs detailing troop movements and battle reports. Just within the salon pod and aligned along a corridor leading to the flight cabin are several rows of passenger seats, much like a troop carrier, and indeed each one is situated with it's on crash harness and survival kit in case of an emergency landing.
As Adalyn, Ash, and Khol enter they find the younglings already strapped in and chattering incessantly about their latest caper, what Master Ruhk is going to do to them, and most importantly, the mission. Clan Zakkeg has only been allowed on a small handful of trips outside of the Chu'unthor before this one, and never on an actual mission, so excitement and enthusiasm inherent in their conversation is infectious. They each take a brief moment to acknowledge the other Jedi, the three ARC troopers, and any other personnel that board the ship, before they are once again engrossed in their own little world.

---

Khol listens intently after they are all settled into their seats and Ash and Adalyn begin to discuss the mission. At first the Korunnai maintains an impassive facade in a fair imitation of Master Ruhk, but as Adalyn's advice continues, and Ash's responses become continually more dour, Khol's mouth slides into a quiet frown. When Ash makes his final statement on respect, Khol steeples his fingers together and rests his chin on them, interjecting before Adalyn has a chance to respond.
**"Adalyn's advice is… *valuable*,"** Khol gives his fellow Padawan a too-quick nod of acknowledgement before he continues, **"But it may not be as applicable to this situation as it would be to others."**
After the quick outburst, Khol sits silent for a moment as he gathers his thoughts. When he is ready he nods slightly to himself, as if confirming an idea, before continuing.
**"Think on what Master has said: We will be meeting the commander of a Mobile Surgical Unit. That would mean they are either a combat medic, or a doctor that has served with soldiers on the frontlines. That sounds like someone who has earned their title, and likely by saving lives in extreme situations."**
Khol quirks an eyebrow at Ash as he judges the effect his words have on the younger Jedi, and then he inclines his head a centimeter to the right, the Korunnai equivalent of a shrug. As he does so, his Padawan braid swings errant across his face, and he scoops it over an ear before he speaks again.
**"I would say that you don't have to respect'm any more, or any less, than anyone else but you would do well in respecting him, *period*. Show them who you truly are, and that who you truly are *means* something, and you will be respected and followed in return."**
Just as Khol completes his profundity, the crew of the *Aegis* boards the cruiser and makes their way into flight cabin, while several clone gunners take their positions in the gunnery wells around the ship. More republic personnel, and even a few Jedi that will be transferring to New Holstice upon the ship's arrival, also board the ship, and then lastly Master Ruhk. He is truly an imposing figure, massive and clad in armor and billowing robes, and when he enters the cabin the youngling's excitable conversation immediately fades to guilty silence. The feeorin master grunts quietly to himself as he notices how quiet his young wards have become, and as he lumbers through the aisles of seats he comes to sit quietly next to the youngling clan, causing their guilty fidgeting to increase.

---

A slight tremor accompanied by the sudden feeling of a rapid deceleration is all the indication given that the *Chu'unthor* has exited from hyperspace. Running lights blossom into illumination all around the Aegis, and with another lurch and the roaring sound of power thruster engines igniting, the Consular-cruiser takes off from the A42 flight deck and enters the inky loneliness of space. If looking out of a viewport from the *Aegis*, those onboard would see a scurrying swarm of escort fighters, personal transports, and support ships surrounding the *Chu'unthor II*, while to the fore is the MedStar squadron that the Aegis was sent to defend.
The medical squadron consists of five *MedStar*-class frigates, with two *Pelta*-class frigates and a half-dozen V-wing fighters for escort. Judging by the amount of blast scoring marking each frigate, the squadron had seen a heavy skirmish on their way to the jump point, and it is a likely bet that the squadron had started with more than just the six starfighters that patrols it now. As the Aegis moves into position at the point of the scrabbling fleet, a squadron of ARC-170 starfighters breaks off from the swarm surrounding the floating Jedi Academy, and assumes combat space patrol around the entirety of the newly formed fleet, bolstering its defenses further.
**"We'll be travelling as fast as the slowest cruiser, so we will be adding an additional hour or two onto our travel time. Everyone get as comfortable as they can, and we will alert you when we are due for arrival, or if any trouble starts."**
The voice of the ship's captain blares around the small compartment, and then clicks off with a hiss from the intercom. The stars stretch and distend, then swirl together all around as the *Aegis* gracefully leaps into hyperspace, the rest of the squadron soon following suit.

## Re: Act I: Descending into Darkness

### **Alicia** (2011-06-24 01:24:03)

Taking pause at Ash’s outburst, Khol easily interjects. As he takes his time in placating their young friend, Adalyn’s thoughts begin to wander. Khol is right of course that not all of her advice would be needed, though she doubts the full lesson would hurt in the long run, but as he mentions the MedStar cruisers her thoughts divert from their task at hand.
Adalyn takes on a far away look as she leans forward, her chin cupped in her knee rested left arm. *That’s right… It’s going to be a medical convoy.* Ever since the start of the war, whenever she was on a medical ship she always sought after her older sister. The idea that her sister might coincidentally be stationed on any of the ships she encountered was silly to her afterwards, but it was a hope she never seemed to squash in the end.
“**I wonder…**” is all she gets out as the other passengers begin to arrive. Sitting up straight and proper in her own chair as Master Ruhk arrives, she becomes distracted by the guilty demeanor of the younglings. *What have they been up to?* she thinks with a frown. As the voice of the captain sounds overhead and with the promise of an extended wait till their mission proper would start, she tries to settle back into her seat the urge to daydream again becoming increasingly hard to deny.

When Khol interrupts, Ash is wise enough to listen. The older padawan speaks rarely but his words are usually worth listening to.
'That makes sense,' he agrees thoughtfully. In truth it isn't so much the title "lord" he objects to in any case, it's the word "my" preceding it, implying that the speaker is somehow subservient. Upon thinking it through Ash believes he can select his words carefully enough to avoid a terrible diplomatic faux pas and remain true to his own principles.
As Master Ruhk settles down by the younglings Ash turns his attention on the Feeorian.
*It's just like him to set such an important test within a field that I have no experience with, he just loves to take us out of our comfort zones.* Ash thinks, then suddenly remembers a catchphrase that was often mouthed among the Midnight Prowlers when someone acted in a way that exemplified or even caricatured their typical behaviour:
'Classic Ruhk,' he mutters to himself, then more vocally: 'all right, I think I can do this. Just be polite and respectful. I can do that. Probably.'

## Re: Act I: Descending into Darkness

### **Anazider** (2011-06-25 19:13:50)

**"You will do well."**
Khol graces Ash with one of his rare smiles, bolstering the youth's confidence. The Padawan then retreats into silence once more, only moving to spare a nod for Master Ruhk and the others as the Cruiser begins to fill up. After the Aegis makes the jump to lightspeed, Khol leaves his seat to inspect the holoboard, and this prompts others to rise and inspect whichever portion of the cruiser they find most interesting.
During the course of the trip, Clan Zakkeg's latest escapade comes to light after a bit of interrogation by Master Ruhk: They had played a prank on the Dug smuggler, Rongis. Rongis smuggles goods out of Separtist-controlled territories for the Jedi, and has a reputation for accepting the most dangerous of missions. It is also well known that Rongis charges exorbitant prices for his smuggled goods, but having little desire for money and access to the Repbulic's bottomless coffers, many of those onboard the Chu'unthor grudgingly pay for the smuggler's exotic wares.
But Clan Zakkeg had had enough, especially after Rongis cheated another youngling clan out of a box of candied Bofa fruit. Buthbo synthesized a stink bomb from several of the plants in her garden, Depik reprogrammed a pair of DUM-series pit droids to spray the Dug, and Jyzen and Wexal made off with the candies and distributed them to other younglings before high-tailing it through the launch bay and onto the *Aegis*. Even Master Ruhk has a difficult time containing his mirth at the story, but as penance the Jedi master apprehends all of the candied fruits, and promises that the younglings will work for Rongis until their debt is repaid.
From there on, the journey through hyperspace is relatively serene, shared in companionable talks, training, and constant news streaming in from the various warfronts. Although several hours pass, to the passengers of the *Aegis* it is only a passing epoch in time, and before long a brief chiming sounds around the many halls of the cruiser to signal the emergence from hyperspace.

---

As the cruiser enters the system, they are welcomed by a Republic defense fleet. The MedStar frigates and the fighter cover break formation, each headed for their own destination on or around the planet, while the Aegis makes its way to the New Holstice capital of Memorial. The cruiser glides through opalescent cloud cover as it passes through the planet's atmosphere, and as the last cloud passes, the entirety of the world opens below the Aegis, and a flock of some colorful native bird honks by in startled greeting. New Holstice is the very model of picturesque tranquility, with rolling hills, grassy plains, and crystal-clear lakes fed by bountiful waterfalls.
A slight bump rocks the *Aegis* as it makes its landing, and its passengers soon begin the disembarking process when given the all clear by the captain. First out of their seats are the Zakkeg's, but they are quickly corralled by Master Ruhk. After everyone has gathered their belongings and the flight crew completes their landing checkdown, the boarding ramp to the cruiser lowers, and a pleasant breeze of warm, moisture-heavy air enters the cabin and washers over the Jedi. The other passengers exit first, followed by the ARC troopers who secure the foot of the ramp with a soldier's conditioned precision. Folding his hands within the billows of his robes, Master Ruhk marches down the ramp, his heavy footfalls thudding with ever step, while the Zakkeg's trail after him. Khol, Adalyn, and ash bring up the rear, and as they all reach the bottom of the ramp, Master Ruhk turns to lock gazes with each of his students as he imparts his instructions.
**"Youngling's stay with, and obey, the Padawan's- I mean it Jyzen, *no* schemes or adventures,"** Master Ruhk speaks with steely authority, and Jyzen stands at full attention as his name is mentioned. The Feeorian stares at the younglings for a long moment, to make sure that his word sink in, before he turns his attention to the three older Jedi.
**"I would recommend you take them to the memory moth crystal at the center of the city, that should keep them occupied and it is something that every Jedi should see. It is near to where you will meet with Captain Elarc Vel, the commander of the Rimsu units we'll be taking with us."** The Jedi Master then turns to focus solely on Ash, his violet-eyed gaze penetrating and bracing.
**"Remember: Agile mind, peaceful hand, and above all else, trust in the Force. My comm channel will be open if need be."**
Master Ruhk then turns without another word and walks towards what appears to be the local command center. Captain Janders salutes the family of Jedi, Lieutenant Howler gives Ash a brotherly punch in the shoulder, and Switch gives the dark-haired youth a wink before all three move to flank the Feeorin. That leaves Khol, Adalyn, and Ash alone with Clan Zakkeg at the base of the boarding ramp, the bustling city of Memorial spreading out before them.

## Re: Act I: Descending into Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2011-06-26 16:21:07)

Ash bows to Master Ruhk and grins as Howler and Switch offer him their goodwill in their own ways.
'I will not fail you,' he resolves aloud, then turns round to face the younglings.
'It's rare that we get an opportunity for a trip like this,' he tells them, 'so let's not give Master Ruhk any reason to regret trusting us okay? We're all on our best behaviour.'
He deliberately says "we", hoping that by associating with them his instructions may have some more impact on the Zakkeg clan.
'Pair up: Jyzen and Depik, Wexal and Buthbo. Stick close to your partner and look out for them just in case something does go wrong. Nothing should though so long as nobody wanders too far from the group,' he adds, 'Khol is the easiest to spot, so keep him in your sight at all times. if you lose sight of him you've wandered too far - comm Khol, Adalyn, or myself and we'll come find you.'
Of course Ash realises that strictly speaking he's not one of the padawans the younglings have been ordered to obey, nor has supervising them been strictly stated to be a part of his responsibility on this mission, however he is very determined for everything to go smoothly and he imagines Khol won't contradict what he's said. He looks at the Korunnai to read his expression.
'How long do we have until the meeting?' he asks, 'Is there time enough for us all to see the crystal or should I head straight to the meeting once we reach the city centre?'

Growing tired of sitting, Adalyn follows Khol to the holoboard the projection showing an array of troop movements and the war fronts. Things had grown dire since she’d last look at the reports. She stood there, looking over the different systems she had her master had once helped to defend, feeling useless for several long moments. Now she had a different mission, though what exactly that was she wasn’t sure yet. Her interest sated, she turns from the board, giving Khol a shy smile before heading off to find something to eat. She had skipped breakfast after all.
As the ship drops out of lightspeed, Adalyn wakes from her light trance, follows the others to the bottom of the ramp, and listens to Ruhk give his instructions to the younglings and then to his padawans. She is pleased to realize he had included Ash in the latter instructions and wonders if Ash had picked up on it. With a bow as Master Ruhk leaves she makes sure she has everything and then glances at the younglings, wondering how long it would be before they came up with a scheme most likely against them.
With Ash putting them in pairs and looking to the Korunnai for affirmation to his plan, she speaks up. “**It might be best under the circumstances for the two of us split responsibility so you don’t have to worry about looking after them, Ash. You’ll have Captain Vel to worry about, after all.**”

Ash nods in agreement with Adalyn's observation.
'Thank you,' he observes, 'I was hoping Khol and yourself could take charge of the youngling's expedition. If that's the case I'll focus on my meeting.
The young Jedi trainee sounds grateful for Adalyn's intervention, despite his apparent self-assurance. He leans in toward Adalyn and murmurs quietly:
'Just keep Jyzen occupied okay? He's the one that stirs up the others. Wexal is the worst confederate which is why I split them up, but all of them can be led to distraction by Jyzen if you let them.'

**"We'll be expected within the hour; Master Ruhk likes to keep a *brisk* schedule with these sorts."**
Khol hands Ash a datapad with the scheduled appointment, a personnel roster, and an overlay map. The medical facility where Ash is to meet Captain Vel is marked in the northeast corner of a plaza, with the memory moth crystal memorial a short walk away at the center of the plaza.
**"We should have plenty of time before the pre-fab units are loaded onto the ship, so long as we don't stay too long. Hate for Master Ruhk to have to come after us."**
The padawan flashes a knowing half-grin, and when Ash pairs the younglings he earns an approving nod from Khol. Four sets of eyes cut towards Ash, almost in perfect unison, with the meanest whose side are you on? glare that he has likely ever seen. This earns a hearty chuckle from Khol, who then taps first Jyzen on the head with a knuckle, then Depik, as a means of choosing them to follow him. Turning their glares on Khol, the two younglings rub gingerly at the sore spots, but they move to flank the towering Korun without question.
**"Good idea Adalyn, yet…"** Khol turns a serious, yet concerned glance on Ash.
**"Are you sure you don't want us there for support? These officials can be… *trying* at times, no matter the respect they've earned."** As he talks, Khol begins to walk away from the cruiser and motions for the others to follow.
The mid-morning crowd in the streets of Memorial are bustling, but pleasantly so, and the small family of Jedi are able to negotiate the avenues with relative ease. Street hawkers of nearly every species peddle their wares, and a constant stream of medical speeders flit about to and from the countless number of hospitals, labs, and spaceports that are interwoven throughout the city. The buildings are all of modest, functional designs from a variety of wars, but two things predominant among them: one, the cleanliness of the surroundings. Not a scrap of litter or ounce of unregulated mold mars Memorial's clinical pristinity.
Second is the tall crystal spire at the heart of the city. From where the young Jedi currently stand, they can only catch glimpse of the spire's tip from over the peaks and eaves of nearby buildings, but what they do see appears to coruscate with an inner light. And above all of their physical senses are the feelings that wash over them through the Force; a gently uplifting melancholy, like the wistful remembrance of a departed friend or the reflective yearning for days gone past.

Ash flicks through the datapad, familiarising himself with the details of the appointment. This provides him with a perfect means to ignore the betrayed glares of his erstwhile comrades. Running a cable from his own datapad bracer to the portable unit, he transfers the information to his own hardware before handing the unit back to Khol.
'I'd like at least one of you to be there,' Ash admits as he falls into step beside the tall Korunnai, setting a brisk pace to keep up with the padawan's long stride, 'but I don't see that we have a choice? We can't exactly take the whole group along to the meeting, can we? It wouldn't give the greatest impression.'
He lets out a small sigh of resignation and shrugs, accepting the circumstances for what they are.
'I'll just have to do the best I can. Don't worry, I promise not to let them get to me.'
'Besides,' he adds with a grin, flashing a look back at Jyzen and Depik, 'I'm more worried about the trouble *you'll* be getting into.'
'Between this rabble,' Ash says quietly with a smirk, his words intended for Khol alone, 'you might find yourself needing to play the hero. Just don't bumble it because Adalyn's here.'
As he makes his joke Ash lightly punches Khol on the arm, laughing, then nimbly steps out of reach before the Korunnai can think to punch him back.

Adalyn gives Ash a reassuring smile at his observation concerning the younglings’ mischief causing habits. “**Don’t worry, Khol and I can manage,**” she whispers back conspiratorially, turning to the duo remaining after Khol had begun to walk off. With a bob of her head she motions for them to come along. In the process of keeping an eye on her small group of younglings she takes a good look around, partially marveling at the clinical cleanliness of the city. They were either dedicated, extremely proud in their city or just plain ataxophobic.
“**We can decide once the time comes whether one of us can be afforded to go with you,**” she says, absently still looking around and catching sight of their destination over the top of the prestine skyscape. As the feelings from the spire wash over her, she finds that her pace has slowed almost to halt.
With a shake of her head to clear the numerous thoughts from her mind, she picks up her pace to catch up to her the others. Coming from behind she doesn’t catch what it was Ash says to Khol, though he apparently said something he expected some retaliation. Shaking her head, she wonders who was more likely to get into trouble - the Zakkeg clan or Ash.

**"What?! Hey- "**
Khol's go wide in surprise after Ash's joke, and the Padawan darts a nervous glance in Adalyn's direction before he reaches for Ash in an effort to keep the other boy silent. But Ash anticipates Khol's actions and neatly dances away, leaving the Korunnai youth grasping at air. The younglings all burst into triumphant fits of giggling, having seen Khol so greatly off-balance, and Khol for his part clears his throat with the worst faux-cough anyone has ever heard before he continues to lead everyone towards the crystal spire.

---

As the Jedi draw closer to the city's center, the feelings emanating from the crystal spire grow stronger, until at last they are standing before the tall structure and enveloped completely in an aura of gentle tranquility. The crystal spans over ten meters in height and appears to twist and undulate towards the New Holstice sky all its own, but upon closer inspection the spire is in a solid state and the warping sensation is an optical illusion of the light within the crystal. A low hum permeates the area surrounding the crystal, like the low whisper of countless songs being sung in concert, and a deeper look at the crystal reveals that its light is not intrinsic but rather the byproduct of thousands upon thousands of colorful butterflies fluttering within its depths. The butterflies shine with their own luminescence, and as they fly their light refracts around the crystal and upwards, blending together in a pure white light.
An ever-changing crowd of onlookers surrounds the memory moth spire. Most stand at a comfortable distance gazing at the spire, or basking in its presence while amicably chatting to one another. But several groups idle much closer to the spire, mostly consisting of Jedi or other traditions, either sitting on the well-manicured lawn surrounding the crystal or even directly touching it. Jedi stand at four evenly-spaced crystal podiums surrounding the spire, and each wears the Ansata-marked robes of a Jedi Historian. Within each podium are more of the colorful butterflies perched upon curling tree branches, but these butterflies do not appear to be as brilliant as those within the crystal.
Approaching from the south, the crystal podium nearest to the young group of Jedi is manned by a matronly-looking Twi'lek of advancing years. Khol leads everyone the crowd to the base of a stairway winds past the historian and up to the crystal, and as the Twi'lek spies the tall youth she gives all of the young Jedi a grandmotherly smile before she continues her lecture.
**"The memory moth crystal stands as a memorial for every Jedi that has ever been slain since the inception of the order. Once a name is whispered to a memory moth, and a memory dwelt upon while holding one, that moth will sing that one name for the rest of eternity."**
The Twi'lek historian looks around the assembled gathering, and when her gaze sweeps over Khol, Adalyn, Ash and the Zakkkegs, she smiles again and her next words seem to be particularly for them.
**"When those sensitive to the Force touch the spire, they may clearly hear the song of any name that they focus upon and access the moth's shared memory. Upon touching the spire, if you should not hear the name that you seek, come to me and I shall provide you with memory moth's so that you may honor those that have been lost."**

Ash listens to the Twi'lek's words in amazement, unable to believe that the massive crystal ahead of him is comprised of millons of singing moths. It doesn't seem credible, and yet isn't the Galaxy vast and filled with many amazing things?
In truth, despite Ash's advanced maturity for his age he has had very little exposure to the wonders of the Galaxy. Since leaving his isolated home all he's really known is pain, anger, and injustice.
Stepping forward he reaches out to touch the smooth structure, then slumps forward to rest his forehead against the cool crystal.
*Dad* is his first thought before he angrily reprimands himself: *idiot! He was never a Jedi! Not even an Adept! No one you know is remembered here.*
Unless...
Hadn't his father's friend, the man named Regus Lim, been accused of being a Jedi by the very people who killed both him and Daru?
Unbidden, recollections of that terrible night come back to Ash and it's as if he never left, that all along he's still been that horrified crying child huddled in a corner, watching as Lim tries to explain that he is no Jedi, holding his hands out in meek supplication, and is rewarded with a vibrobayonet to his stomach. Unable to look away though he wants to so desperately Ash witnesses his father springing into action, his san-ni staff swinging with lethal elegance and causing havoc amongst the soldiers closest to him.
Ash remembers the echoing shrieks of multiple blaster bolts, the smell of scorched ozone and of burned flesh. He remembers the clatter of the san-ni staff falling to the floor followed by a muffled thud caused by a larger dead weight. Daru. With his own screams ringing in his ears Ash lets out a whimper and sheds a tear, the small liquid crystal sliding down the side of its larger singing brother.
*He can't have been a Jedi. He should have been able to defend us. He can't have been!* Ash thinks angrily, but he has to know. He has to.
Squeezing his eyes shut, pressing against the crystal with enough force to leave a red mark upon his forehead, he focuses on the name of a man who may or may not have been a Jedi. Who may or may not have been missed enough to merit a memory moth.
He isn't sure he wants a response. He isn't sure what it will mean, or what he'll do.
He only knows that even if he doesn't want to know, there's no turning back, not here. Not now. He *has* to know.
*Regus Lim.*

Adalyn listens to the matronly Twi’lek Jedi Historian as she gives her lecture, the last bit seemingly to be directed at their small group. She bites her bottom lip as she glances toward the spire. There was only one name known to her, but she was unsure whether she could handle the emotions such an act would bring forth. Standing back for a long moment she watches as first Ash and then others proceed to the Moth Spire, touching its surface.
Finally she takes one step and then another until she’s within reach. Hesitantly she reaches out with the only hand remaining to her, her fingertips and then her palm coming to rest on the stone pillar housing the eternal memory moths. For a long moment she stands there, staring at the glowing, fluttering butterflies within and lets the serenity of the place wash over her.
*Is there someone who would have taken the time to memorialized Master Fillin*, she wonders. Her eyes close as her mind’s eye pictures the tall Whipid master as she had last seen him. He had seemed resplendent in the variation of the Jedi Battle armor he donned, the black of his fur clashing with the trampled white snow around them. He hadn’t needed a cloak in the chill, his fur protecting him from the elements.
Taking a deep breath, she whispers the only name which mattered: *Fillin Ta*

**"The nature of the memory moth's immortality is a tightly guarded secret of the force. For countless millennium, scientists have studied memory moth biology in hopes of finding the key to the memory moth's eternal life, but the more that is found the more questions remain. It is known that so long as a single cell of a memory moth exists, an entire memory moth can be reconstituted from it. And each moth born in this manner has carries with it the genetic memory of it's predecessor. Some think that…"**
The Jedi Historian drones on in the background, getting into the meat of her well-practiced lecture, as Ash and Adalyn stand touching the crystal spire. When Adalyn regains her senses, she sees Khol standing near Ash with his hand on the shoulder of the younger Jedi, his face tear-streaked. To Adalyn's eye, a brilliant blue aura surrounds Ash, the brightness of it in the Force almost enough to make Adalyn shield her eyes, but suddenly the aura erupts into blue motes and then vanishes. A memory moth, the same color as the aura that had just vanished from around Ash, perches on the youth's head.

---

Ash has no idea how long he has been kneeling with his head pressed against the crystal spire, but when he comes to he finds Khol's massive hand gripping his shoulder and a blue memory moth perched on his head.
**"Are you okay Ash? When I saw how deeply you were drawing on the Force and… and the tears, I-"**
Khol cuts off with a shake of his head and then says no more, allowing the thought to trail away. His face is a picture of concern, and his doesn't leave Ash's shoulder, but the Padawan does look down at the chronometer on his commlink, then back up to Ash with a slight frown.
**"You've been kneeling like that for the better part of an hour; if you don't hurry you will be late for the meeting with Captain Vel. Do you ne- do you want us to come with you?"**
The Korun tries to give as reassuring a smile as he can, and on Khol's bluff, earnest face it truly is heartening. Behind him, Depik and Buthbo sit with their legs crossed and their hands pressed against the spire, while Jyzen and Wexal busy themselves with trying to catch memory moths with their bare hands.

Ash slumps away from the crystal, heedless of the tears still flooding his eyes. He is dimly aware of a strong hand falling on his shoulder and he looks up at Khol.
The Korunnai is saying something but Ash isn't really listening, still trying to make sense of what he's just seen. Only when the older padawan looks at his watch do certain synapses start firing in Ash's brain and he leaps up like a startled animal.
'I'm late,' he murmurs while violently rubbing at his wet face with a sleeve of his robe, 'I have to go.'
'I'll be fine,' he adds stubbornly, a trace of his normal personality already arising to wall off the vulnerability he has unwittingly exposed.
Ash walks away, straightening his disarrayed robes as he goes and making an obvious effort to compose his features.
He takes a quick look at his databracer to remind him of the arranged location for the meeting then heads straight there, walking fast and with long strides as though to distance himself from the others as soon as he's able.

Adalyn’s gaze follows the memory moth’s passage for a long moment, even after it disappears into the multitudes. The Force had heard her call, but not in the way she had expected.
Drawing back, she let’s her hand fall to her side. As she looks around, she’s startled to see the state Ash is in, his experience with the butterflies having significantly affecting the youth. Light on her feet, she moves to join the two. For a long while Ash seemed to be in a daze, not aware that Khol was even speaking to him, before jumping up.
“**Ash**,” she starts, knowing he was going to need all the encouragement he could get at this point. “**May the Force be with you.**”
Watching as he ran off, a part of her was glad that he had decided he could do it on his own, or at least wasn’t taking her with him. “**He’ll make us proud,**” she says to Khol, before looking up at the Korunnai and giving him a true, yet shy smile. She feels invigorated, more than she has since her master’s death.
“**I hope that you’ll forgive me if I leave you alone with the younglings awhile yet…**” she stops, looking back toward the historian and the tree of waiting memory moths. “**There’s still something I need to do.**”
*There is no emotion, there is peace.*

Khol's hand is left hanging in the air as Ash leaps to his feet and dashes away in a hurry. The Korunnai's countenance is all deeply concerned frowns and confused furrowing of his brow, but when he turns to discuss the matter with Adalyn he is left with even greater confusion as the other Padawan mutters a hasty apology and then is off for the historian's lectern. Exhaling a slow, calming sigh, Khol shrugs to himself and then goes to coral Jyzen and Wexal, who appear on the verge of plotting something devious, while Depik and Buthbo continue to sit near the crystal- Depik chatters idly about everything she had seen, while Squeaks listens graciously while weaving a necklace from long grass.

---

The Twi'lek Historian completes the remainder of her lecture before answering questions or attending to those that would like a memory moth. When it is Adalyn's turn, the elderly Jedi smiles and places an age-worn hand on the center of her podium. After a moment's concentration, she withdraws her hand and fluttering in her palm is a memory moth with wings of a deep saffron.
**"Once you hold the moth within the palm of your hand, open yourself to the Force and dwell upon the memory of those that have been lost. Speak their name while holding the memory, and they both shall be imprinted upon the moth, whereby it shall glow with remembrance forever more."**
Lifting her hand aloft, the memory moth dances within her palm before taking to the air. When Adalyn raises her own hand, the memory moth swoops from the and lands delicately in the young Jedi's palm, the feel of the insects gossamer crochets tickling her fingertips.

**"Good morning sentients, I'm Andarla Zek and headlining your 0900 galactic standard newshour is the reported death of Hnhr'roov, a Wookie shipjacker connected to theft of a prototype yacht from Baudo Shipyards. As we broke the story to you earlier this cycle, Hnhr'roov had bargained a reduced sentence in exchange for further information regarding the mysterious criminal organization known only as 'The Wire'…"**
The sounds of the mid-morning marketplace stream by Ash as he dashes through the streets, idle market-goers leaping out of the boy's path as they spot him rushing their way. The medical facility is not that far distant from the crystal spire at the heart of the city, but the winding nature of the streets and the increasing number of citizens and speeders filling the avenues seems to impede the young Jedi at every turn. More than one muffled apology is offered as he proceeds, and more than one accidental disaster is averted through a judicious use of the Force, but after many a close call Ash finally arrives at his destination.
The medical facility is a large pre-fab building that sits at the corner of a curving intersection. Composed of practical angles, the building's profile screams function over form, and if the ease by which the numerous medical speeders stream into and out of the facility is any indication, it performs its duties admirably. A tall security gate surrounds the building, and as Ash passes through it he finds himself on a large, neatly manicured lawn that leads to the front of the building. No square-centimeter of the lawn goes unused, another testament to the building's practicality, and toward the rear of the lawn sits a row of massive duracrete cubes; the pre-fab RIMSU units, still fully packaged. With a few polite inquiries, Ash pointed towards the RIMSU units, and the medical personnel standing in front of them.
**"Captain Vel, we still have not received our supply of cortical stim units, and Major Donrell says- "
"I don't give two flaming karks what Major Donrell says! You tell that perverted old bastard that he… "**
What follows is a melodic stream of expletives and improbable threats the likes of which could even burn the wax out of Ash's old street-urchin ears. Captain Vel wears the white lab coat of a doctor, but from what Ash can see the captain also sports a crisp officers coat underneath, and interestingly enough her trousers are decorated with a double-class Corellian bloodstripe. Although when Captain Vel turns around and finds Ash standing there, the young Jedi is confronted with quite possibly the most beautiful woman he has ever laid eyes upon.
**"Well, you want somethin' kid or you enjoyin' the free show?"**

Ash has never really understood the phrase "took my breath away" until this point, but when the foul-mouthed woman turns to face him he finds himself stunned. By her looks sure, but in equal part in sheer amazement that such depraved curses could fall from her perfect lips.
It's enough of a shock to bring him back to the present, which is good. Up until this moment he had still been dwelling on his experience at the crystal.
At Captain Vel's attention he straightens up and assumes as professional a manner as he can muster.
'My name is Ash Peztar, and I represent Jedi Master Ruhk. It's a pleasure to meet you Captain Vel.'
He smiles - thanks to her beauty this expression comes naturally, given his mood he'd feared it would be forced - and bows in respectful greeting.
'Are you nearly ready? May I assist with anything?'﻿

Leaving the now confused Khol to roundup the troublemakers, Adalyn waits as patiently as she could manage for the matronly Jedi Historian to finish and get to her. At last the saffron colored butterfly rested in her palm. The weight of the creature was non-existent and the only sign of its presence was the slight tickling of her palm.
Drawing away from the lectern, out of the way, she looks down at the moth. *Such a tiny creature for such an amazing task. This tiny creature was to hold a final memory of Master Fillin for eternity,* she marveled.
She realized she now had a great responsibility to provide a memory of her late master which would serve as a proper memorial for the man and Jedi he was.
Moving slowly, Adalyn makes her way toward the spire, taking a seat on the soft grass around it's perimeter. She closes her eyes, concentrating on her task at hand, the butterfly balancing lightly in her hand. Unsure how long she sits there, sorting through the years of memories she'd shared with Fillin she finally settles on one which feels the most right. Her head bows as unbidden true tears of mourning caome to her, but she holds fast to the memory. Opening herself to the Force, she concentrates and lets the name flow from her mind with the memory. *Fillin Ta*

Captain Vel folds her arms across her chest and shifts her weight into an impatient stance when Ash begins his introduction. As the young Jedi continues, Captain Vel's lips scrounge up into a sneer that is near a snarl by the time Ash finishes, and when he does the Captain waves a dismissive hand in his direction and turns away.
**"Great! So the big sithspittin' Jedi General sends one of his brats to get me! Well ain't that about a- hey!"** 
In two swift strides the Captain leaves Ash where he stands and is across part of the lawn, verbally pouncing upon what appears to be a rather low-ranking supply officer. Ash is only able to catch bits and pieces of the very, very one-sided conversation, but part of it ends with, **"I bet your mother knows how to find a kriffin' torque…"**. Near the end of the tirade, Captain Vel has both hands on the collar of the hapless quartermaster, and she is shaking with gusto. At last she releases the poor man, who skitters away as quickly as the physical laws of this universe allow. Finally, she storms back over to Ash and looms over him. Given the view, this is not an entirely bad thing for the youth.
**"You wanna know how you can *assist* me?! ASSIST ME!! You can help me by making everyone else not an idiot! You can help me by finding me two Starshine Surprises and a Zeltron grav-ball player to drink them off of! But if we're talking in karkin' realities here, you can help me by meditatin' in a corner, or whatever the kriff it is you do at Jedi baby daycare, and staying the fark out of my way! I'll be ready when I'm Forcefrickinsithspittinnerfkriffin-the-fark READY!!!"**
And with that the woman marches away from Ash like he no longer exists and finds someone else to terrorize. Many of the medical personnel gathered around smile and shake their heads like they're use to the blonde demon's antics, but she has the rest of the republic personnel in the area constantly looking over their shoulders. The few healthy troopers in the area give the young Jedi wry grins or barking fits of laughter before acknowledging new orders over their commlinks and marching towards the hospital's entrance, intent on their next mission.

*Fillin… Ta…*
The memory moth whispers the name of the slain Jedi Master, and when Adalyn extends her hand to free the butterfly, it flares with a brilliant light the color of a dusk-shrouded sun, fading behind gossamer clouds. It continues to sing the name, each trill fading on a gentle breeze only to be added to the eternal song serenading the memorial. Before long, the memory moth flutters through the crystal to perch on a curling tree contained therein, and no matter where Adalyn looks Master Fillin Ta's memory seems to shine brightest.
Adalyn feels a comforting pat on the shoulder and when she looks up she finds the Historian's hand on her shoulder, a lifetime of selfless compassion reflected in the Twi'lek's wizened, blue face. When the elderly Jedi feels that Adalyn is sufficiently comforted, she turns back to her podium to start her lecture anew as more spectators come in and the clone trooper guard rotation changes. Even as many sit dwelling upon the past, life on New Holstice continues to march towards its inevitable horizon...

Chancellor Palaptine's shrill voice echoes around the city's center from a multitude of holoprojectors, and it booms from loudspeakers strategically placed around the medical facility's courtyard.

Ash physically bends away from the Captain's verbal onslaught like a reed battered by a storm. What had been amusing directed at others was infinitely less so when the full fury of it is being vented at him. It's enough to take the joy out of the view.
'I could easily acquire you two starshine surprises, but the Zeltron may prove difficult,' he begins dryly, but trails off as Vel storms off across the lawn to ruin somebody else's day.
'What the kriff was that about?' the young Jedi wonders aloud to the amusement of the nearby medics and soldiers.
Before he can decide on his next course of action, Ash is distracted by the news feed suddenly airing throughout the city. He recognises Supreme Chancellor Palpatine immediately, but as the holoprojection's message begins taking form he feels a chill travel down his spine.
*A threat within? I've got a bad feeling about this.*
Something doesn't seem right. In fact he has the nagging sensation that something is very wrong. Ash has been a Jedi initiate long enough to trust in his instincts.
He continues to watch the broadcast, unaware that he is holding his breath and unconsciously grasping for his lightsaber hilt.

For a long moment Adalyn watches the moth in melancholy ambivalence.
In a way, she felt as if she was saying goodbye - something up until now she had been unable to do. A weight had been lifted from her heart as the memory moth flitted from her hand to join the eternal chorus - singing her master’s name. Her guilt at surviving had driven her to wallow in despair. Ash had been right– strange it was to admit. Her master wouldn’t want her punish herself. There was no reason to. While she may continue to mourn his death, she would do so by remembering and honoring that which he had taught her.
Her eyes close - *There is no emotion, there is peace* - then she looks up as the matronly Jedi Historian places a comforting hand on her shoulder. The touch was reassuring in its compassion and the young Jedi managed a smile of appreciation before returning to her own thoughts. *I’ve been selfish* she realizes. *And ignorant, unfaithful to what Master Fillin tried to teach me.* Instead of trying to work out the emotions raging in her she had dwelled on them, fuelling the pain and anxiety. She had stumbled and rather than picking herself up, she had fallen.
With a heavy sigh, her eyes close once more, her thoughts focusing on the tenets, the Jedi Code taught to her since she could remember.
*There is no death, there is the Force.* Looking up at the memory moth, shining brilliantly for her, she realizes the literal truth of the tenet embodied in the small creature. While she knows the Jedi mean something differently for those words, right before her she sees a creature imbued by the Force to carry an aspect, a memory, of her master for eternity.
As the speech begins, the sound of it booming across the grounds of the memorial, the sense of foreboding with it causes her to snap to attention. *Have there always been this many guards stationed?* At first she thinks maybe they expect a riot of some sort as a result of the speech, but the feelings she has through the Force are hard to ignore.
Through her life she has been told to trust in this feeling and so she jumps to her feet, seeks out her companions and hurries to their side. The urge to flee was strong. So much so that the words the Chancellor utter become almost indistinguishable. Activating her hands free com link she hopes she can get to Ash in time. "Ash... Meet with us. Now!" she says into the comm her urgency severe.
“**We need to go,**” she says to the towering Khol, as quietly as her urgency allows.
Her gaze passes over the crowd. *Should I warn them, but warn them of what? All I sense is some impending doom.* Not knowing what to do, she seeks out the best way for their small family to escape from whatever is to come.

**"They've affixed vibrobayonets… You do that if you expect a close quarter fight, not for guard duty or a riot…"**
Khol stands at a promontory near the crystal spire, overlooking the influx of clone troopers while almost the entire crowd turns to view the Supreme Chancellor's announcement. His frown is dark and his eyes troubled, and when Adalyn comes to him with her plea, the look of desperation in her eyes is all he needs to move without questioning.
**"Time to go Zakkegs! Stay between me and Adalyn, and move quickly."**
Depik and Squeaks share a nervous glance, but the steel in the Korunnai's voice is enough to make the younglings leap to their feet and fall in line. Gone is the confused and awkward teenager of just a few moments ago; Khol has become the battlefield commander, one forged in the fires of the Clone Wars. When Adalyn brackets the youngling clan at the rear, Khol begins to make his way through the lawn and down the stairs near the Jedi Historian, his considerable height and the thunderhead scowl he wears causing people to quickly move out of his path.
**"Younglings keep together, and no matter what happens you get to Master Ruhk and the ship. Understood?"**
Speaking in a low tone, Khol passes the order over his shoulder to Adalyn and the Zakkeg's, but when he turns his head for confirmation his eyes are for Jyzen. The Korun's voice has become quieter, and almost monotone, but when he turns to look over his shoulder or scan the continually-increasing number of clone troopers in city's center, Adalyn notices a frighteningly dangerous look in Khol's eyes; one similar to the look he gave her when she grabbed his arm, what seems like ages ago...

As she leans down to eye level with Ash, and prepares to skewer him in the chest with the same finger, she cuts off mid tirade and turns to regard the nearest holoprojector as if seeing it for the first time.

The Jedi Historian raises an aged hand to her face, covering her mouth at the horror of the Chancellor's proclamation. As Adalyn passes by the Twi'lek, the matronly woman turns to caution the younger Jedi, but her words of wisdom shall remain forever unheard as a blaster bolt parts her Ansata robing at the breast.
All around the Jedi, the song of the memory moths becomes discordant and rises to an almost deafening pitch. But as the chaos in the song grows what is heard is not the whispers of the immortal butterflies, but the screams of the betrayed and dying. Young and old, infirm or hale, armed or peaceful, it does not matter; across the galaxy the Jedi are being exterminated, and every death seems to reverberate in the Force. Wexal, Jyzen, and Buthbo raise their hands to their ears in an attempt to shield themselves from the screams that echo only in their minds, while Depik hugs her arms to herself and falls to her knees, tears streaming from her eyes. Khol holds a hand to his chest over his heart, while in his other hand he tightly grips his lightsaber.
More blaster fire screeches through the park, and the shouts that fill the area surrounding the crystal memorial are all too real. The blaster shot that silences the ancient Historian punctures a neat hole through the crystal spire, striking the nesting tree within it and starting a small fire. Several other wayward bolts join it, and soon the crystal memorial is alight with a wholly different kind of fire, smoke billowing through the multiple holes now perforating it. The brilliant lights of the memory moths flare and then are consumed in flame or drowned in dark grey smoke, and only a small handful of the butterflies manage to escape.
**"By order of the Supreme Chancellor you Jedi are under arrest for treason and conspiracy to overthrow the Republic! Failure to submit to arrest will be met with lethal force!"**
A squad of six clone troopers surrounds the small Jedi family, three in front before Khol and three behind in front of Adalyn, all with their blaster rifles trained. The terror and fury in the city is almost tangible, but from the clone troopers the only feelings the Jedi can sense is the cold, incomparable certainty that comes from following orders without question.

---

The chill running down Ash's spine spreads to his entire body as the Chancellor's speech continues. It is almost enough to set the young Jedi's teeth to chattering, and it is accompanied by a borderline inability to draw breath, like the breathlessness one would experience after a perfect punch to the solar plexus. Ash barely has the willpower to not fall to his knees, but he is left visibly shaken. Captain Vel steps forward to catch the youth, a healer's impulse or some other emotion driving her, but she freezes again as she catches sight of something just over Ash's shoulder.
**"By order of the Supreme Chancellor you Jedi are under arrest for treason and conspiracy to overthrow the Republic! Failure to submit to arrest will be met with lethal force!"**
When Ash turns around, he finds the muzzles of three blaster rifles staring him in the face. Late morning sunlight glints off of the perfect white of the clone trooper's armor and the enameled black of their visors, and the commands coming through the speakers on their helmets contain not a trace of hatred or pity. Suddenly, Ash feels a sharp tug at his shoulder and then just as suddenly he finds himself being pulled behind none-other-than Captain Vel herself. The captain raises a hand to word off the three troopers, and with the way that the sun highlights her hair, to Ash Elarc Vel looks positively angelic.
**"Now you hold just one Force-forsaken minute there soldier! I don't know what the kriff Ol' Palpy there is talkin' about, but this is still a farkin' kid, Jedi or not, and I'm not going to just- "**
A rifle-butt to the head causes Captain Vel's argument to end with a sharp click of her jaw, and the rabid Corellian woman lands in a groaning heap at Ash's feet. The clone trooper that struck the captain trains his blaster rifle on her prone form, while the other two stay leveled on Ash.
**"In accordance with contingency order 66, any Republic personnel and/or citizens found aiding and abetting any Jedi are to be arrested and charged with treason and conspiracy to overthrow the Republic! Submit now, or face execution!"**

---

***"The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated! Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. These have been trying times, but we have passed the test. The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger. The war is over. The Separatists have been defeated, and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning. In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society, which I assure you will last for ten thousand years!"***

Adalyn follows behind Khol, taking up the rear as he leads the Younglings out of the plaza. As Palpatine’s speech continues on, she’s glad he hadn’t questioned her. What had been a wonderful day, a supposed milk run, was turning into a nightmare. When Khol looks back at her she catches the hardened, dangerous look of his eyes and a shiver runs down her spine.
Her gaze meets the Jedi Historian’s who moments ago had been comforting her in the supposed safety of the memorial plaza. Before the matronly Twi’lek could speak to them, she was shot down.
The cry in the Force was almost deafening as her Jedi brethren are cut down without prejudice, betrayed by those they had fought beside the last three years. For a moment, Adalyn’s vision flashes white, but then fighting through the pain her determination wins through. She knew loss, she knew pain, and she was beginning to accept it all. If she didn’t fight then the small family she had been brought into would perish.
Adalyn wasn’t going to fail them.
As the clone trooper surround them, blocking their way forward and their way back, and spoke the orders, Adalyn calls on the Force willing the clone trooper to lift from the ground to be thrown into his closest comrade. Drawing her saber, the cool metal of the hilt brought her complete focus to the task at hand.
With her innate ability combined with the skilled training of her Master, Fillin Ta, she focuses on her companions coordinating and giving them hope while at the same time baffling their opponents. The ability she had once used to aid those clones which had been her allies in battle was now turned against them.
In a smooth motion she draws her lightsaber and charges at the third clone trooper before her. Her green blade a haze as it cuts through the air.

Before Ash can reply to Adalyn's clipped warning he is interrupted by the Supreme Chancellor's continued speech. The young Jedi is filled with a sensation of such profound shock by Palpatine's words that he very nearly collapses under the weight of the feeling. He has never felt worse. That is to say, he has never felt worse except for a few seconds later when he is overcome by loss and agony as thousands of jedi lives are abruptly ended in a brutal fashion that sends ripples through the Force that can be felt even at the farthest reaches of the Galaxy.
*So many! So many!*
The pre-teen screams his agony, his anger, and his terror out to the skies, staggering a step backward as though struck by a physical blow. Ash is dimly aware of Captain Vel rushing forward in an attempt to support him, and of the clone troopers stepping forward to arrest him. His expression as he looks up into the blaster rifle muzzles is very nearly feral, no doubt confirming in the minds of the soldiers the madness of the Jedi and the necessity of their recent orders.
He growls in the back of his throat, fingers clutching for his lightsaber hilt, but is suddenly swept around to a place of temporary security by Captain Vel.
Surprised and filled with gratitude at her bravery, he is able to subdue his animalistic rage somewhat and think about the consequences of his actions.
*You're on your own again Ash, just like before. Don't run like you did then. Think smart this time!*
And yet his anger flares again when his angelic (if oddly foul-mouthed) rescuer is knocked down by a sharp blow from a clone trooper's rifle butt. This time he keeps his fury in check, but Ash realises he can't just escape, not if it means leaving Vel to take the heat for aiding him.
He takes advantage of the momentary distraction to draw his lightsaber and ignite it in a fluid motion. The steady thrum of the blade is comforting.
'Hey, you barvy droyk-for-balls,' Ash spits at the clone trooper still training his weapon at the fallen medical officer, 'I'm the one you want. Right here.'
Bravely or foolhardily depending on one’s point of view, he gracefully leaps over the prone form of Vel in order to give the clone troopers something more pressing to concern themselves over than an execution shot.
'I'm sorry Adalyn,' he says into his comm with an air of finality, 'get the younglings to safety.'
Move action to draw/ignite lightsaber.
Move action to tumble adjacent and to the right of the lead trooper in an attempt to avoid his AoO (shouldn’t provoke from the one at the back as advancing into his threat area not moving through it). Acrobatics +8
Swift action to use comlink.

With her purpose clear in her mind, Adalyn draws deeply upon the Force and focuses on the energy emanating from the Clone Troopers and their tributary to the flow of life. Drawing upon the raw emotion and vibrancy profligate in the surrounding area, the Padawan uses the Force to slightly alter the course of fate itself, and as she does so the Clone Troopers become more dull in reflex and skill, while her companions find their battle acumen enhanced.
Maintaining her channel to the Force, Adalyn grasps the life essence surrounding the center-most clone in front of her and uses it to hoist the trooper into the air. When the clone trooper is at a dangerous height above the ground, Adalyn uses her grip on the Force to violently hurl the clone at the trooper to his left, both landing in a loud clamor of plastoid armor and the very-audible snapping of bone. The clone trooper she initially hurls lays with his helmet twisted at an unusual angle, while his brother-in-arms now finds himself with the ability to touch the heels of his feet with the back of his head. Both are very, very dead. **(UtF: 27. 6d6 damage for 30)**
**"They're resisting- Open fire! Open fire!"**
The clone trooper in front of Adalyn shouts orders to his comrades before raising his blaster rifle to unleash a torrent of red-flavored death on the Padawan. Adalyn evades the blaster bolts, seeming always one step ahead of the trooper's aim, until she is completely within his guard and slashing at his knees. A seasoned combat veteran himself, the trooper rolls away at the last second, suffering a glancing blow to his leg, but undoubtedly still in the fight. **(1d20+10 = 23 attack, 7 damage)**

---

**"Why you smarmy little- "
"Look alive corporal, here he comes!"**
Ash's foul-mouthed ploy works, as he feels a spike of anger coming from the trooper looming over Captain Vel which is promptly accompanied by a wildly errant blaster bolt. With an agility that only the young possess, Ash leaps over the fiery doctor and then turns the jump into a hand-spring to the right of the lead trooper, which causes a second blaster bolt to go scorching through the space he had previously occupied. **(1d20+8 = 21, acrobatics check successful)**
The young Jedi is able to evade another blaster bolt, but a fourth shot scores a sizzling furrow along his cheek that briefly bleeds before the heat of the blaster fire cauterizes it. The trooper that scores the glancing shot moves to surround Ash, and the dark-haired youth lashes out with his long-handled lightsaber but only manages to scratches a snaking black wound on the troopers armor. Now surrounded on three sides with only his back exposed, the clone troopers don't seem intent on allowing Ash to escape. **(7 damage to Ash)**

---

Khol shakes his head against the lingering pain of the death convulsion, and when he looks up his eyes are clear and full of menace. The Korunnai lets loose a terrible roar, like the roar of a wounded Nexu, and after igniting his lightsaber he charges the lead clone trooper. The trooper raises his blaster rifle in a terminal effort to defend himself, but Khol cleaves through the weapon in a slash that takes the blade of his lightsaber from the crown of the clones helmet through its armpit, leaving the man a smoldering wreck.
Spinning at an almost inhuman rate, Khol brings his lightsaber up in a crossing slash to deflect a blaster bolt harmlessly into the sky. But the concentration required for this feat leaves the Padawan open to fire from his flank, and Khol finds himself unable to parry the blaster bolt that lances painfully through his thigh. The Korun's leg buckles painfully around the wound and he falls to one knee, his lightsaber weaving warding circles around himself.
**"Khol!"
"Stay back!"**
Khol's shouted order is ignored as first Jyzen, and then the rest of the Zakkegs charge the clone trooper that shot the Korun. The leaping, twirling, and shouting of the younglings would seem almost like something out of the Corusca Circus, if not for by the end of their flurry the clone trooper they attack is left staggering and barely able to stand under his own power. Although their training lightsabers are made to stun only, a stunned opponent in a real battle is almost as good as dead.

A part of her registers Ash's message, and inwardly Adalyn curses - he was on his own. There was little hope they would be meeting up anytime soon with the hospital being in the opposite direction on their ultimate destination - Master Ruhk.
With the lead clone trooper having dodged out of the way of the brunt of her attack, Adalyn pushes forward looking to finish it before moving to help Khol and the Younglings who had gone to his defense in a flurry of blue Amd green training sabers. Her own green saber comes down on the trooper once more, her full intention in ending this quickly before anyone else got hurt.
Their lives were at stake.
Her mind moving ahead, she intends on moving to intercept the last untouched trooper, hoping to draw his attention away from her wounded fellow Padawan.

Ash grits his teeth against the painful searing of his cheek. That, he thinks, is going to sting like a bitch later.
It also serves as a bitter reminder that he is no Jedi Master able to fight off armies, and that jumping directly in front of three armed soldiers is now top of the long list of unwise an unthinking actions he has perpetrated in his short but eventful lifetime. Nor is he a good enough fighter to be able to quickly dispatch three clone troopers highly trained in melee combat and wearing thick plasteel armour with only a low-powered training saber. The only saving grace of the plan is that it succeeded in its intended effect, ensuring the safety of Captain Vel.
*Captain Vel! She's carrying a pistol!* Ash thinks in a moment of epiphany, realising instantly that the weapon will be a damned sight more useful to him right now than his training saber.
Switching to a one-handed grip, he continues to dodge the clone's blaster fire, striking out often to prevent them from being able to do much more than fire snap shots. Reaching behind him with his other hand he clears his mind and focuses on the sidearm holstered at Vel's hip, willing the holster's clasp to slip free and the weapon to soar into his hand.
He doesn't believe he can fail: something about the plan just seems right. He has never been able to tell with complete certainty whether such feelings are the result of his Force training or simply his overconfidence, but they have never failed him on the few occasions he has felt them before.
Trusting in the Force to guide him, Ash opens fire the moment the pistol lands in his palm.
UtF +8 to move light object; DP to make use of the ranged attack unleashed ability. Obviously this post assumes the success of the move light object - if that fails please assume Ash uses his standard action to make an attack and I'll edit the post to reflect when I get a chance.

### **Anazider** (2011-07-09 19:13:33)

The clone trooper facing Adalyn grips the stock and barrel of his blaster rifle, then lets loose a warcry as he viciously lunges at the slight Padawan. A memory brief drifts across Adalyn's thoughts, of a spar not too long ago and Ash's desperate charge in an effort to beat her for the first time. Adalyn uses the clone trooper's momentum against him to neatly spin away and behind the soldier, like a leaf dancing on the wind, and as she twirls the Padawan inverts her one-handed grip on her lightsaber and stabs behind herself. The lightsaber pierces through the clone's spine and out through his heart, and when Adalyn withdraws her lightsaber the clone trooper collapses in a boneless heap, quite dead. **(1d20+8 = 17, 14 damage)**
Adalyn then skirts around the battle to come up behind the undamaged clone trooper, but his focus is solely on the injured Khol. The clone is intent on bringing the lumbering Korunnai down, as the trooper knows that the fight has become suddenly more desperate, but when he unleashes another hail of blaster fire on the padawan, Khol manages to deflect every bolt.
**"Down!"**
Without looking, Khol sweeps his lightsaber in a blurring arc behind himself and Clan Zakkeg ducks in perfect coordination as the blade of the saber whizzes over their heads to disperse a rain of blaster fire. Khol leaves the uninjured clone trooper at his back to dash at the one that attempts to fire on the younglings, and when the Padawan reaches the unfortunate soldier his lightsaber hums in an overwhelming staccato of slashes and thrusts. Already barely able to lift his blaster rifle after the attack of the Zakkegs, the clone trooper does all he can to evade and ward off the lightsaber, at last sacrificing his blaster rifle in a shower of blue and red sparks that leaves the weapon cleaved in twine. But this also leaves the trooper with his guard down, and the tremendous hooking punch that Khol lands smashes through the trooper's helmet and sends the clone tumbling backwards end-over-end and through the windshield of a landspeeder parked nearby.
Jyzen prepares to lead the Zakkegs in a charge against the remaining clone trooper, but an outstretched hand from Khol halts them in their tracks. The lone trooper takes a cautious step back, but then sets his stance, preparing to square-off against every single one of the Jedi, even if it costs him his life.

---

The trio of clone troopers surround Ash in a classic Dantooinian firing squad, blaster rifles raised and at the ready. As they open fire, the Force is with the young Padawan as one of the clone troopers finds that his blaster rifle jams and rather inconveniently disperses the entirety of it's charge. His comrades duck to avoid the uncontrolled torrent of blaster fire, and this has the added benefit of causing their shots to also go awry, leaving Ash at the center relatively unscathed. **(1 on attack, negative effect rolled)**
As Ash calls upon the Force, weaving it around the Captain's sidearm in an effort to telekinetically pull it towards himself. The youth's confidence rises to new heights, but sinks to a new low as the blaster begins skitter across the lawn and stops as if it were caught on something.
That something just so happens to be Captain Vel's hand. The Captain's hand rises as quick as a striking viper, and from her back she fires three shots in rapid succession. An eerie silence descends on the area surrounding Ash's desperate fight, then suddenly it is broken by the clattering collapse of all three clone troopers, each one sporting a smoking blaster hole right between the eyes. Captain Vel manages to give Ash a roguish wink before her head slumps back to the grass. **(Rolled 20 on attack, 26 damage each)**
**"Karkin' rude bastards! Help me up kid, we gotta get you out of here and I think that sonuvabarv gave me a concussion…"**
Captain Vel shakily moves her hand to the side of her head, where she finds a rapidly-swelling knot and a small trickle of blood. Each probing touch causes the Captain to wince or groan, and it does appear that she is having trouble with her balance, which makes recent gunslinging all the more brilliant. When finally helped to her feet, Captain Vel is still a bit woozy and has trouble walking straight under hown power, requiring her to lean heavily on Ash. For the youth, this may not be that great a burden.
**"Welp! Looks like my career is about finished- wasn't really cut out for the army anyway. C'mon kid, facility's got a private spaceport for bigshots and emergency care speeders. We get there, we can vapor trail it out of this dump and figure out what the kriff is going on!"**

Determination fuels the young woman as she flanks the lone, remaining trooper. She and Khol are in no position to take a captive - not that she believes the trooper would submit. They are now fugitives, and while the troopers were only doing what they were ordered to, she can't show mercy. 
Not if they are to survive.

Ash is flabbergasted when his plan fails thanks to the intervention of Captain Vel, superb as her own efforts may have been. Still, what matters is the results and those are undeniable.
'Impressive gunplay, lady,' he acknowledges as he hoists her up and allows her to drape an arm across his shoulders.
The youth considers her suggestions and has to bite back his initial thought, which is to get back to the others and to Master Ruhk.
They have every bit as much chance to escape as him. A better one, really. He can always find them later once everyone is safely away, and Vel is right. The nearest and easiest escape route is the correct one.
'Sure, let's go,' he agrees. Acting as a support, he allows her to direct them while taking on the burden of her weight.
As they walk on, he alternately attempts to comm Khol and Adalyn in order to explain to them his situation. He wonders while he does so how they and the younglings are faring, but won't allow himself to believe any of them have come to harm.

Adalyn and Khol prowl around the clone trooper between them. The young Tapani moves with the fluid grace of a dancer, while the towering Korun stalks with the lethal sureness of a predator. But the clone trooper is no stranger to battle himself; impressed with the memories of a ruthless warrior, and the survivor of half a dozen major battles, the clone sets his stance and then quickly rolls away when he feels Adalyn pressing the attack behind him. **(1d20+10 = 18, 7 damage)**
The trooper comes up firing, Khol still his target, but every crimson lance that issues from the clone's blaster rifle is either turned aside or evaded by the Korunnai. Khol lopes forward with deliberate, purposeful strides and when he is within the troopers guard the clone brings the butt of rifle down in a two furious two-handed chop meant to brain the Padawan. Raising his left arm, Khol blocks the chop at the clone's wrists, then brings his lightsaber up in a vicious lunge that takes the trooper through the chest and off his feet. In one fluid motion, Khol spins and slams the clone trooper, the blue-bladed lightsaber acting like a giant dissecting needle as it pins the clone to the ground.

A pregnant silence follows the death of the last clone trooper, even as the cacophonous sounds of battle and subjugation surround the young Jedi. The streets of Memorial are thick with fighting and the constant traffic of patrol speeders and hover ambulances, but as of yet no one appears to be advancing on their position. The younglings of Clan Zakkeg turn wide, imploring eyes on the dead men at Khol's feet, then on Khol himself, but the Korunnai averts his gaze and moves to pull his lightsaber put of the impaled trooper as an excuse to not look at anyone. Depik is weeping openly, while Wexal and Buthbo do their best to console her, although they are not doing a very good job of managing their emotions themselves.
**"Khol, what… What are we going to do?"**
Jyzen steps up behind Khol as he asks his question, although the look he gives Adalyn asks the same of her. The sandy-haired Zabrak holds his training saber as if half of him wants to throw it in a gutter and afterburn in the opposite direction, while the other half wants to run screaming into the nearest platoon of stormtroopers, to exact a toll for every Jedi lost this day. To his credit, Jyzen does neither and instead stands firm, giving the other younglings some measure of courage while they all look to Adalyn and Khol for guidance.
**"We get Ash, we get to Master Ruhk, and then we get back to the *Chu'unthor*. Master and the Council will know what to do… "**
Khol's voice is an emotionless monotone, although there is an undercurrent of barely-muted pain and cold-fury bubbling just beneath the surface that sounds distinct to Adalyn and the younglings. The Korun leans heavily to his left, favoring his wounded right leg, although the look he gives the company of clone troopers gathering in front of the medical facility is a promise that he will tear through them all to get to Ash. With the number of wounded Jedi, Jedi healers, and MedCorps gathered at the facility, it is quickly becoming one of the major flashpoints of the battle, and one look at the Adalyn and the Zakkegs is enough to cool Khol's intensity, if only by a slight amount.
**"No -I mean- yes, we gotta do all that, but what are *we* going to do Khol? You heard what they said! They're going to kill- "**
**"One pebble at a time moves a rockslide Jyzen, s'what Master always says. I don't know what we're going to do, but we have to survive to do it. That means taking things as they come, one at a time."**
The emotionless drone to Khol's voice is gone, replaced with a dreadful weariness that shouldn't belong to a young man of fifteen years. Jyzen looks up at Khol to give further voice to his fears, but upon seeing the pained strain on the Korunnai's face, the youngling closes his mouth and merely shrugs. This earns a brotherly grip of the shoulder from Khol, and at that same moment Ash's communique comes through, further brightening what little morale remains.

Ash and Captain Vel stand at the eye of one of many storms gathering around the large courtyard, although no other attackers appear to immediately notice them. The Captain directs Ash towards one of the facility's many emergency exits by regaling him with tales of how she uses it to sneak drinks between operations. Even with a dazed and endlessly-blabbering amazon draped over his shoulders, Ash manages to navigate the chaos of the courtyard without attracting attention, and when he and Captain Vel close the door to the service entrance behind them, it is a certified miracle of the Force that they arrive mostly unscathed.
**"H-hey kid… Hey… Lift's at the center of this floor. Takes you to the garage uptop…"**
It's obvious that Captain Vel is having difficulty maintaining her concentration and when next she attempts to speak, instead of her usual verbal vomit, actual vomit comes up, which she noisily deposits on the ground and around Ash's boots. The pungent smell of regurgitated alcohol fills the dimly-lit hall in front of the exit, while the beautiful captain is busy spitting and scrubbing her mouth with her lab coat to rid herself of the taste.
**"Knew that was karkin' comin'. Don't, uh… Don't let me nod off here kid. Kriffin' bad to go spacey the way I feel. Kriff me for leaving my bag in my office!"**
A sudden realization comes to Ash: Captain Vel has been mumbling nonstop in an effort to keep herself awake. As her attention continues to wane, and her eyes blink in an uneven fashion, it is becoming readily apparent that she is quickly losing this battle. A long corridor leads from the service exit to the interior of the medical facilty, and the fading sounds of blaster fire can be heard not too far away.

((**SPECIAL** => All right folks, here are some maps to tide us over until my formatted digital copies arrive (same maps, but I'll be able to augment (bug Alicia) those to better reflect positioning) and I'll explain things a bit: Ash and Elarc start in the upper left-hand corner of their map, and the turbolift to the garage is in the center. The Captain is doing a bit worst than she was before, but a) the blaster fire sounds fairly close, and b) Ash doesn't know his way around this floor of the hospital, aside from that the turbolifts are at the center. Ash is still slightly injured.
The effects of Adalyn's battle meditation continues to last, as this encounter isn't entirely over, but you are currently outside of combat rounds. Khol's leg is somewhat badly injured, but he's the only one and he seems to be handling it well. Khol, Adalyn, and the younglings are occupying the ground space between the two statues to the south of the memory moth crystal (the blue fountain thingie). Continuing to head south takes you back the way you came, and is the most direct route to the *Aegis*, but it also appears filled with some of the heavier fighting. Taking the roads east or west will likely take you back to the ship, but will also take longer and may require some detours. Heading north takes you past the medical facility where Ash is, and also the largest concentration of Clone troopers that you can see.
Questions/comments/concerns, let me have them. Oh, one more thing: 300xp to everyone for surviving the initial encounter. Good work people, but it only gets more *interesting* from here. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: --> ))

Getting through to Khol, Ash feels a momentary lightness that transcends the deep suffering he feels.
'Khol, I'm okay,' he says as quietly as possible, 'but there are soldiers everywhere. I can't talk long, Captain Vel knows an escape route but she's barely conscious. Don't come for me, you understand? It's not worth risking everyone else's lives for. Get the younglings and Adalyn to safety, Captain and Vel and I will get out another way. We can find each other later. And Khol? If I... If I don't find you again for a while, tell Adalyn I'm sorry for the way I treated her. I think that's important.'
Upon closing the comms link he finds himself very nearly drenched in foul-smelling vomit. He nudges Elarc gently with his elbow.
'Don't you fall asleep on me lady,' the youth orders, 'I still need you operating under your own steam. We're almost there okay? Think I have an idea to keep us safe, if I can pull it off... But you have to be quiet. I'll keep pinching you or something. Don't go to sleep.'
OOC: I would like, if possible, to extend the Use of Force Cloak to apply to Vel also. Perhaps a DP to emulate an Unleashed ability? If this fails Ash will just try to be as stealthy as possible with the burden of Vel on his shoulders (Stealth +8)

Adalyn doesn’t move at first as the last of their adversaries is slain. The finality of it as Khol removed his own lightsaber from the trooper was almost overwhelming. Extinguishing her blade, she clips it to her belt and bends down to inspect their equipment hoping they're carrying medpacs at the very least. She had a feeling they would need them. As Jyzen begins questioning the point of it to the equally overwhelmed Khol, she approaches the distraught younglings.
Placing a calming hand on Depik’s shoulder, she looks at them in turn. “**We need to be strong and not give into the despair,**” she starts, enveloping them tighter within her Force influence. For once she wishes she had Vivian’s gift to calm the mind, but Adalyn is just going to have to do the best she can. Her gaze proceeds to the wounded Khol – in his state it was unlikely they could go far unnoticed. They were going to need to take the effort to blend in if they were going to pass through the city.
“**We should keep moving, find some place safe to rest and regroup before we make our way onwards.** ” For a moment she questions whether their master was even still alive. The sense of loss had been so overwhelming; so indistinguishable it would be hard to know whether they had felt his passing.
Her thoughts are interrupted as her commlink goes off and her heart is lightened by the sound of Ash’s voice. “**Ash… Thank the Force,**”she says in a near whisper. A tightening in her throat keeps her from proceeding, but she’s saved the effort to speak as he goes on to update them. As the channel closes once more, the elation that he had survived fills her.
“**The sooner we get moving the sooner we’ll find ourselves reunited.** ” *But which way?* Taking a look south, while direct, she quickly realizes it wouldn’t be their best route considering their state. With a look to the east and west, she opens herself to the Force, letting it guide her like she had been taught.

Khol stares mutely at his commlink after Ash's transmission ends, his expression unreadable. He turns to give one last, forlorn look at the medical facility before shaking his head and returning his full attention to the prospect of their escape. The padawan closes his eyes as he opens himself to the Force, but several moments later his eyes flutter open and he looks confused and disappointed.
"No insight through the Force. Something hides the answer- there is too much fear and pain in the moment."
In her rummaging for supplies, Adalyn finds three medpacs, one power pack, and one day's worth of hard rations. The fighting has become more intense, perhaps a rising action leading to an eventual climax, and the patrols around their area have become more frequent, but as of yet the group is still unnoticed. As Khol stares towards the southern road, his jaw clenches and his look becomes direly grim. The tall youth extinguishes his lightsaber, but keeps it in his hand, as he begins to carefully head in that direction towards the ship and Master Ruhk.

---

**"Ah kriff, now I think my retinas are detaching."**
Captain Vel passes her free hand over her eyes as Ash begins to half-carry her down the hallway, but the captain is in fact not suffering from further symptoms; Ash has surrounded them both in an obscuring Force shroud. The area immediately surrounding the padawan and the surgeon appears darker to their eyes, as if glimpsed through dark, translucent linen and even ambient sound has become more muted.
As they round the corner, Ash and Captain Vel find the interior of the hospital in shambles. Blaster wounds and long scorch marks Ash can identify as lightsaber gouges mar the walls, while the broken bodies of wounded Jedi and clone troopers litter the floor. Scattered around this lobby area are multiple hover-gurneys, most vacant although a scant few have dead or dying patients still clinging to them in some fashion. At the center of the lobby is the turbolift, it's doors wide open and its interior vacant, and four clone troopers secure it at every corner. As of the moment, they appear completely unaware of Ash's and Captain Vel's presence, but judging by the number of boot prints dotting the pristine floor, a greater number of soldiers cannot be too far away.
**"No! We healed you! I saved your lif- "**
Even through the Force cloak, Ash can clearly hear the pain and incredulity in the statement before it is abruptly silenced by the report of a blaster rifle. The voice, alien and heavily accented, comes down from a nearby stairway, and is accompanied by the sounds of booted feet marching, and anguished sobbing.
((**SPECIAL** <!-- s=> -->![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!-- s=> --> Sorry for the lateness folks, I've rewritten it so many times to try and include so much that I've finally settled upon this for simplicity's sake, and to get back on track. Now! Down to business:
Alicia's already added the newfound goods to her sheet. Khol is about to leave the relative safety of your current position to head south towards the starport, but has not yet. With the amount of blaster fire raining around the area, Khol, Adalyn, and the younglings are subject to a random possible chance of being hit by blaster fire until they reach another safe area. Having an ignited lightsaber out mitigates this somewhat, but it also draws more attention and the greater possibility of being caught by a patrol.
Ash is just in front of the small stairwell to the west of the turbolift, and there is a clone trooper stationed at each corner around the lift. Due to the use of the destiny point, he and Captain Vel have a)total concealment and b)+10 to stealth, although they are both hampered somewhat by the captain's debilitation. Maintaining Cloak is a standard action, but Ash does not have to make a new UtF check because of the destiny point and can sustain until end of the encounter. From their current position, it will take one move action to get inside of the lift, and a swift to activate, but both Captain Vel and Ash will have to make a new Stealth check upon approach.))

### **Alicia** (2011-07-18 15:24:22)

Adalyn takes a moment to take a deep breath as the onslaught of fear and hatred is opened to her once more, nearly taking over her senses completely. “**I feel it too…**” she starts her eyes closed as her Force imbued talents allow her to see what her eyes cannot. “**But I can also see a light at the end, at the space port… Master Ruhk is waiting for us.** ” Her eyes open with the last thought and there’s a small smile there, but her expression quickly changes as she spots Khol start on his way down the direct path and also the most dangerous.
Moving to jump into his path, she does her best to avoid grabbing a hold of him. “**Khol… No… We can’t go that way.**” Looking down the southern route she could almost still see the light that was emanating from the space port, like a beacon lighting a sailor’s way home. Only this way was full of rocks which would surely drown them. Her gaze turns back to Khol and then the younglings. Maybe if it had been just she and Khol they could’ve risked it, but it wasn’t just their lives.
“**This way,**” she declares moving toward the eastern route, gathering up the Younglings as she passed. She couldn’t ignore the feeling of apprehension she had felt, but whatever they would face down this path was probably better than the greater risk of being in another fight. Opening her senses once more, she stays on guard for any approaching patrols which would ruin their escape, her hand lingering over the hilt of her lightsaber clipped at her waist.

'Hush,' Ash reprimands Elarc, not even aware as he does so how much their roles have reversed since their initial meeting only scant minutes ago, 'you're fine. Well, no worse. It's me, I'm hiding us.'
As they turn the corner and face the guarded turbolift, Ash momentarily draws back despite the protection offered by their immersion in the White Current. It is at this moment that he hears a useless appeal from some not so distant location and the sound of gunfire, presumably a healer gunned down in cold blood. One of many innocent victims of this crime. Hearing continued weeping and realising there are others it takes all of Ash's willpower not to rush off in a madcap rescue attempt. He realises if he does so he will only doom himself and Vel.
Grinding his teeth, he eyes the guards warily. If it were just him he'd be confident about making it, but with Vel in the state she's in...
It has to be risked.
'Right,' he tells her quietly, 'listen to me. This is important if you want to live. They won't see us but they could still detect us with other senses. So make no sounds and move as stealthily as you can. We can take it as slow as you need to-' here he pauses momentarily, wondering how long it will be before a patrol passes, then quickly brushes the thought aside in favour of encouraging Elarc,'-so don't worry. Where the floor is dirty step in the existing boot prints, both our feet are small enough that we shouldn't leave an obvious trail if we do that. Does the elevator have an access code?'
Once furnished with that information or an answer in the negative, Ash leads Elarc out across the hall toward the lift, confident in his powers but less confident in the combined stealthiness of himself and his attractive though vomit-speckled and incredibly woozy burden.
Standard: maintain cloak; move: get to lift, Stealth +20/+19 factoring in Condition penalty (I am happy to spend a FP if necessary though I strongly suspect it won't be Ash that causes any problems given his modifier!); Swift: activate lift

**"Whaat? Oh…"**
Captain Vel takes Ash's admonishment with little reply, further showing to what state her condition has degraded. The captain reaches just within the collar of her jacket and fishes out and access card on a corded lanyard, and as Ash carries her across the hospital's lobby, she holds the card in a tight fist, as if the grip will keep her senses in the present.
**"You hear something Dusty?"'
"Jus' the same Gex. Remember: we're jus' followin' orders, s'what the best troopers do."
"Not that ya dumb mynock, I mean… "**
Ash crosses the lobby at a slow, yet steady pace, and Captain Vel has enough sense to keep her peace, although her eyelids are now beginning to droop heavily. The two clone troopers ahead of him continue their discussion about what they may, or may not, have heard, but do not appear cognizant to the fact that a Jedi and would-be traitor are walking right between them. But just as the padawan gets he and his unlikely ward across the threshold of the turbolift, Captain Vel stumbles and falls to her knees, wrenching Ash around the neck and threatening to send them both sprawling. The lurching sensation is enough to further upset the captain's stomach, and the sounds of her dry heaving are such that even Ash's powers in the Force are not enough to muffle them. **(Captain Vel rolls a 1 on stealth)**
**"Hey, what the slag!"
"It's comin' from the lift; gotta be some Jedi trick, get in there!"**
One of the clone troopers raises his blaster rifle and begins to step foot into the lift car, while the other calls for backup. Captain Vel's concussed state quite possibly saves both of their lives, as torrent of blaster fire scorches the back of the turbolift at chest height, where she and Ash had both stood mere seconds before. Ash desperately activates the lift car and directs it towards the top level, but the lift's doors meet the resistance of the clone troopers arms, and slowly begin to slide back open. Half-crawling and half-sliding across the turbolift floor, the vivacious doctor slams a hand against the emergency close button while she also feebly attempts to insert her security card into the offered slot.
The safety sensors within the lift car trigger, and the car refuses to move while its doors are obstructed. The clone trooper's arms are effectively trapped, although his blaster rifle waivers menacingly in the air, and just beyond the doors Ash can hear the booted footfalls of several more troopers approaching the front of the lift.

---

Khol halts in his tracks as Adalyn leaps into his path to stop him, and as she relays the warning she has received through the Force, the Korun's frown becomes even more grim. He nods quickly, and then alters course to take the eastern road, lightsaber in hand.
The pristine serenity of Memorial has quickly deteriorated into a blaster-scorched war zone. Landspeeders lay burning and twister along side of the roads, and inert bodies sprawl everywhere, like carelessly-flung ragdolls. Not all of the bodies in the streets belong to Jedi, though; it would appear that some of the Republic's citizens have not fully invested in the Chancellor's, now Emperor's, rhetoric, and have paid the ultimate price for their compassion. With Adalyn's senses and Khol's defensive acumen, the two padawans are able to avoid stumbling upon a pair of patrols, while also deflecting any stray blaster fire.
The road that Adalyn has selected appears to curve further eastward before eventually drifting back south, and as the family of Jedi continue, they find themselves traveling through a residential area. Most of the buildings in this area appear to be cheap prefabrication, although well maintained, and likely belong to Memorial's more working-class citizens. An eerie calm cloaks this area, although blaster fire still rings in the near distance, and it would appear that the fighting was lightest in this part of the city. The Younglings have mostly managed to compose themselves, although Jyzen mimics Khol in keeping his diminutive training lightsaber in his hand at all times. Khol's limp appears to have improved, but with the stoic mask that the he is wearing it is difficult to tell if this is due to a lessening of pain or sheer determination on the Korunnai's part.
Thirty meters ahead of the Jedi, the road bends into a blind turn and as they pass the opening an alley, a series of faint clicks and buzzes echo from within the alley's depths. Wexal startles at the sound and pauses, and when the youngling turns toward the alley the sounds grow slightly louder and more distinct. Not too long after a female Arconan appears from the shadows enveloping the alley, and she beckons quickly for the Jedi to follow her.
**"She says that we are friend of the Jedi, and wants us to follow them. She says there are many soldiers around, and more will return any moment."**
A deeper look into the alley shows that the Arconan is not alone; several other Arconan men and women also linger in the shadows away from the entrance. They all wear the heavy duty clothing of laborers, and by the few beams of sunlight that manage to pierce the darkness in the alley, it is apparent that more than one of the Arconan have the gold-tinted eyes of salt addicts. The eyes of the female that first beckoned to the Jedi are flecked with gold, although they mostly retain their verdant coloring. She beckons once more rapidly and then disappears back into the alley, and judging by the posture of the other Arconans it would appear that they are all extremely nervous.
Wexal looks to Khol and Adalyn for guidance. As of the moment, there are no signs of any advancing patrols, and the streets remain deserted.
**Darkness Falls: Escape from Memorial! Round #4**
-Ash Peztar - 17
-Clone Troopers (medical facility) - 16
-Captain Elarc Vel - 7
((**Special** <!-- s=> -->![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!-- s=> --> Something I forgot: For Ash's use of the Destiny Point, he and Captain Vel gain a +2 to attack for the next 24 hours, so factor this into your stats please. Ash and Elarc are staring down the muzzle of a blaster rifle, and the clone trooper is squeezing his trigger although he counts as pinned, as per the Pin feat.
Khol, Adalyn, and the Zakkegs are about fifteen meters (10 squares) from the opening from the alley, and thirty meters from where the alley makes a blind turn back towards the spaceport. They detect no clone troopers through the force, and in total there appears to be six Arconan laborers in the alley.
Questions, comments, and/or concerns, let me hear them.))

Reacting fast, Ash frees himself from Vel's grip. Ignoring the pain he now feels around his neck, the young Jedi drops his Force cloak and instead focuses on the blaster rifle pointed into through the lift doors, intending to wrench it free from the clone trooper's grip with the Force and fling it harmlessly into a corner of the turbolift. In the same instant Ash ignites the lightsaber, the distinctive thrum of the blade no doubt audible to the pinned trooper.Regardless of the success of his attempt to disarm the soldier, Ash holds the energy blade just above the man's arm as though it were an executioner's axe ready to drop.
'I suggest you remove your arm before I'm forced to remove it permanently,' he informs the clone coolly. Ash is glad that the soldier has no way of knowing that his saber is only capable of non-lethal attacks, although he expects if he's forced to use it he can still cause some real damage. As he has found out in many training duels, non-lethal does not equate to pain free.
Move action to "Move Light Object" +7 - Once again I am prepared to spend a Force Point if it'll help (I realise there is a Force Disarm power for this kind of thing but figured it's worth a shot, and even if he has no chance mechanically Ash would probably try anyway); Swift action to ignite lightsaber; Readying a standard action to attack the clone trooper if he takes any course of action other than withdrawing his arm - after applying all current modifiers, attack +1, damage 2d10+1.

There’s something to be said about being on the run after those who had trusted the most turns around and begins to exterminate the people they had been working with through life and death situations for the last few years; one learns how to distrust. All she has is her trust in the Force and her small family standing with her and the hope Master Ruhk will continue waiting for them.
While Wexal looks between his two elders for guidance, Adalyn herself is torn between her own sudden mistrust of others and her want to find some temporary sanctuary. It’s not hard to believe the woman’s words. While the fighting had reached a high here, no doubt patrols would make their way through looking for stragglers and on these deserted streets they would surely draw attention.
Taking a step toward the alley she keeps alert not wanting to be caught by surprise should in the end the woman has nefarious motives. She looks them over as she draws closer for any sign of weapons which might be used against them.

Ash's cool tone is met by a muffled curse, but the blaster rifle wavering haphazardly in the air through the small gap in the turbolift doors begins a slow retreat. With less than half of the barrel in view, the clone trooper releases his grip on the blaster rifle and the weapon is left dangling, trapped by the gently-crushing pressure of the sliding turbolift doors.
**"Farkin' hell kid, can't believe that work- "**
Captain Vel aborts an expletive laden congratulations as an evenly-spaced beeping sound echoes inside the lift car. The sound comes from outside of the turbolift, and sounds somewhat distant, although the beeping is gradually getting closer and becoming more rapid. Oddly, Ash notes that the clone troopers are no longer gathered around the exterior of the lift and the clamor of approaching reinforcements has all but ceased. All is quiet except for the beeping noise, and as it draws closer Captain Vel grows more and more pale, quite the feat considering her already-sickness bleached pallor.
**"oohhh kriff. Kriff me with a rusty spanner kid, pull the blaster out of the door! Pull the karkin' blaster out right now!!"**
With renewed vigor, the good doctor jams her security card in the slot on the lift's terminal and begins to alternately punch the buttons for the hospital's garage level and the door's emergency closing as if her life depended upon it. Ash, perhaps taking a queue from the captain's urgency, draws deeply upon the Force and pulls upon the blaster rifle obstructing the door, hurling it towards the back of the lift car where it clatters and then begins to rapidly discharge the entirety of its power pack, forcing the unlikely companions to duck for cover unless they find themselves randomly perforated. **(UtF 1d20+8 = 28)**
Something *tinks* softly against the turbolift's doors as they slide shut and then rebounds. A pleasant chime accompanies the closing of the lift doors, but just as the car begins it ascent a deafening explosion rocks the turbolift, throwing Captain Vel and Ash from their feet and bouncing them all around the lift car and into one another. The front of the lift crumples dangerously inward and tongues of flame snake under and through gaps in the viciously warped sliding doors, but it is a testament to the turbolift's crafters that the doors and the lift's exterior shields its occupants from the worst of the blast.
The lift car shudders and then takes a stomach-churning plunge downward a few floors, providing Ash and Vel with a few seconds of weightlessness before gravity rather rudely reasserts itself. This last collision is enough to briefly rob Ash of consciousness, but before he succumbs the last sensations he experiences are a stuttering ascension, and the foul-mouthed mutterings of an *incredibly* soft cushion. **(12 damage to Ash)**

---

Through her Force-honed perception, Adalyn detects that several of the Arconans gathered in the alley bear blaster pistols, while the others wield makeshift weapons. Except for the lead female, each of the Arconans appears intensely nervous, and as Adalyn approaches a whispered murmur of clicks and chitters passes amongst the laborers. Khol watches anxiously, the grip on his lightsaber tightening, but when the Arconans fail to leap in ambush he quickly checks the road once more and then ushers the younglings into the alleyway.
As Adalyn draws closer, her senses expand to further encompass the buildings standing to either side of the alley, and a series of life forms garners her attention just on the other side of the door that the Arconans stand gathered around. The life forms are very similar to the Arconans, but much smaller, and a brief scrutinizing glance through the Force reveals to the Padawan that the lifeforms are indeed Arconan children; the adults must be gathered outside in the alley as protection against the fierce conflict plaguing the city.
The lead female Arconan beckons rapidly one more time, and then she produces a keycard from within her heavy overcoat and uses it to unlock the door and motions for everyone to get inside. Half of the other Arconans file in ahead of the Jedi with little prompting, while the other half bracket the Jedi family with the lead female locking the door behind them all. The interior of the small room in which Adalyn, Khol, and the younglings find themselves is dark, except for several sets of blinking, green-tinted eyes staring back at them, and the lack of light makes it difficult to gather numbers or to become oriented with direction.
**"Jedi save us. Save us from *salt*,"** the words rolls clumsily off of the tongue of the lead female from somewhere behind the Jedi, and as she continues it is apparent that she is moving around the group and deeper into their location.
**"Nest R'hshal remembers! *Jedi* save us, we save *Jedi*!"**

---

A shower of sparks from above and the stinging sensation of blood and sweat in his eyes rouses Ash from his light doze. The cabin of the turbolift barely illuminated, owing to the destruction of most of the lighting during the lift car's frightful journey. From what the padawan can see, the turbolift appears canted at a not-regulation angle, and the lift's doors are fused together wherever they are not scorched with holes and twisted metal furrows. Sunlight and dust motes filter through some of the improvised openings, while others peer into the seemingly-endless darkness of the turbolift shaft below.
**"Lay ther… n'longer kid… gonna start chargin' ya… "**
When Ash lifts his head to look around, he will soon realize that it had previously rested upon a bountiful portion of the doctor's anatomy. It may be the padawan's imagination, or perhaps his head wound, but if he didn't know any better he might think that the Captain had an arm protectively draped around his shoulders as he wakes. An arm that feebly attempts to shove him aside when Ash begins to stir. The Captain is a mess of bloody streaks and sweat-soaked blonde curls, but the smirk she gives the young Jedi is no less sardonic or challenging.

Ash lets out a breath he hadn't known he'd been holding.
'I honestly wasn't sure it would work either,' the young human admits, turning to face Elarc with a relieved expression as he switches off his lightsaber.
An insistent beeping begins somewhere outside the lift, getting louder and closer by the split second. Ash doesn't recognise it at first, but Captain Vel's panic triggers a rush of memory, recalling to him an old holovid he'd seen as a child: a war movie.
*Grenade*, he realises with sudden chill clarity.
With more power than he intends Ash yanks the blaster free, and as it rips forth from the door the lift slams shut. Whether as a result of pressure applied through the Force, a damaged firing mechanism, or a snagged trigger, the rifle discharges its entire power pack while flying through the lift. Ash yelps and throws himself in front of Elarc though it it turns out to be an uneccessary if heroic gesture: all of the bolts, by some twist of fortune, miss the pair of them. The weapon clatters, spent, against the rear of the metal frame.
The turbolift doors slam shut just in time and subsequent to a musical chime the lift begins its descent. Ash is in the middle of a relieved sigh when a powerful explosion rocks the lift and as it plunges downward he is thrown free of the floor. Knocked off its axis and tearing against the walls of the shaft, the screeching, crumpled frame comes to an abrupt halt that throws Ash bodily against one wall. He is vaguely aware that he bounces and lands on something else, mercifully softer. But his mind is blank, his vision fading...
He wakes later - *Hours? Seconds?* - with a pounding headache, blinking furiously as he tries to make sense of where he is.
When Elarc speaks to him the memories come back in a torrent amidst other thoughts and sensations he is quite incapable of making sense of right now: *wherewhypainsoftdangersweethelpsafepanicnoamIfineisVelbytheForceAdalynKholdamnitwhywhywhywhywhypleasewhy*. In a moment of pure panic Ash leaps to his feet. Or tries to at least - the very effort of standing so fast causes him to slump dizzily back to his knees with a groan.
'What now?' he croaks, gazing at Elarc with the beginnings of some real fear evident in his expression. Weak and wounded as they both are, trapped in the elevator shaft, some of the cool confidence he had tried so hard to project is stripped away.
Even as he asks for help, for her to take charge, Ash feels shamed. *This is not how a Jedi should act.*
Once more, slower this time, he gets to his feet. Moving carefully around the lift so as not to disturb what may be a fragile balance, he begins inspecting for possible exit routes. As he passes the blaster rifle he checks to see if it is still serviceable - finding it in perfect working order despite the enormous strain recently exerted on it by both the lift doors, and himself, Ash quicky replaces the power pack with the spare form his utility belt. He sheathes his lightsaber and keeps the firearm in hand. Doing so makes him feel strange and un-Jedi-like as though it were some kind of betrayal, but he recognises that in his condition he is no shape to get into another melee. If he has to fight it had better be at a distance and from behind cover.
If necessary: Acrobatics +7, Perception +6

Adalyn blinks as the enter the dark room, hoping her eyes adjust and relaying on her other senses. Her head turns as their leader locks the door behind them and then circles around as she speaks. Relief floods through Adalyn as her initial fears are proved false. She had taken a gambit after all hoping they truly wished to help and as a return for the good deeds of the Jedi who came before no less.
“**Thank you,**” she manages to say into the darkness, nearly whispering and then repeats herself louder. “**We don’t wish to inconvenience you longer than necessary, but we could use a place to rest and treat our wounded. After that we can be on our way.**” *They might even know a safe way to the spaceport*, she thought, but that could come later.
Glancing around again, the nervousness of the nest was palpable. She had seen the bodies of those she suspected had tried to stand up for the Jedi on the way; it was a death sentence to be helping them. “**We don’t want to be putting you in any danger.**”

A light blossoms from somewhere in the cramped room, and then another, and soon dim illumination reveals the rough details of a wide basement that has been converted into a living area for the fair-sized Arconan nest. At least eight Arconan children come into view, most of an age with Wexal and the other younglings, although a few look like they may be as old as Ash judging by height and development. Several cots, beds, and sleeping palettes line the far walls, and from their current vantage point the Jedi can see that a few are occupied by the slumbering wounded. Judging by freshness of the bandages, most of the injuries are new and were likely caused in the initial ambush of the Jedi.
When Adalyn begins to speak, the lead female and several of the other Arconans focus their attention on her, but it is obvious that they have some difficulty with Galactic Basic. After the padawan completes her request, the lead female turns her attention on Wexal and after a brief exchange in their native tongue the lead female Arconan nods an assent, and Wexal translates for everyone's benefit.
**"She says that we do not know what is going on, or why, but we know that the Jedi are good and we owe them much. You may rest, and we will keep watch. When all are ready, we will find a way to make sense of what has happened here."**
Perhaps it is nerves or the familiarity of his native tongue, but it would appear that Wexal has fallen back into the Arconan speaking convention of referring to himself as 'we', and he doesn't seem to notice it. The head Arconan nods appreciatively of the youngling's skill with Basic, and most of the other Arconans nod in agreement, although there are a few dissenting frowns and stares. It would seem that not all are happy about this arrangement and the possible added danger of harboring Jedi, but for the moment all appear to be following the females lead, and if there are any Arconans more vehemently opposed they have yet to fully display it in front of Adalyn, Khol, and the younglings.

Ash is able to stand without disturbing the turbolift's precarious balance, although the quickly amassing clusters of cuts and bruises all over his body ache in furious protest. Captain Vel's head drops back to the lift floor when the young Jedi stirs, and she appears to be making a great effort to keep her eyes open. The dust in the turbolift has mostly settled, and sparks still shower down from busted lights and dangling control panels overhead. It does not take any greater effort for Ash to make a circuit around the confines of the lift car, but his careful steps make sure to not further disturb the injured captain, or possibly alert anyone near the turbolift's exterior.
The roof of the hospital is mostly flat landing strip, and used for the reception of emergency patients which are then taken to the trauma ward on the floor below. Through one of the tears in the lift's sheet metal towards the rear of the car, Ash can see several small landing pads, likely reserved for the hospital's administrators or more high-maintenance doctors. Only three of the landing pads have ships and they do not appear to be particularly guarded, but without knowing which ship belongs to the Captain, Ash is unable to pick out an easily travailed route.
**"What the kriff was that?!"
"I don't know mate, but the lift caught Skipper pretty good; he's out cold."**
Standing about five meters from the lift doors are a trio of clone troopers, although only two are conscious and they both look as if they've recently picked themselves up off the ground. One of the two troopers left standing crouches over his fallen comrade, while the other keeps his blaster rifle trained on the turbolift, although Ash can tell by the clone's posture that he is particularly on edge. The lift doors were blow inward by the blast on the first floor and although they are barely hanging to their supports, they currently afford Captain Vel and the young Jedi some measure of obscuring cover. One of the holes at the back of the lift could possibly serve as an escape route for Ash with some squeezing on his part, or for both he and the Captain if the hole were made bigger.
**"I'm not gettin' anything from Sarge or the guys on the first floor, should we go down to investigate?"
"Probably best to stand pat here and await further orders. Dropship suppose to be inbound with another two squads; after they arrive we can go down and report in if we've not heard anythin' else."**
((**SPECIAL** => Ash is not quite in combat rounds yet since what he does will decide whether or not there is a fight. The clone troopers are currently three squares from the front of the lift door, and the landing pads are over a dozen squares to the rear. I will post a map if ever I find one that fits what I want, but otherwise game on!))

Ash groans quietly as he peers out at the two clone troopers. They represent another significant barrier to escape, but he must do something soon before the dropship arrives or he and Vel will be doomed.
Thinking of the woman, Ash's eyes are drawn to her and he pales with concern. So close to her ship, she looks near-incapacitated. With his abilities he may be able to use stealth to approach and enter the vessel - always assuming he can work out which one is hers - but there's no way the Captain can make it with him in her condition.
There's so little time, but he realises at least some of it must be spent attempting to patch the Captain up. Desperately Ash wishes he knew the advanced technique of vitality transferance, but he knows better than to attempt such a potentially dangerous discipline untrained.
Instead he returns to Vel's side, digging around in his utility belt for the 8-2A medical bundle stored within. Designed to complement a Jedi's natural healing ability, the bundle is stripped down from a normal kit and may be less effective in treating a regular person. Vel's own kit would probably be better suited, but Ash is unwilling to risk using treatments that he knows nothing about anymore than he could chance on healing the Captain using the Force.
With the basic tools and rudimentary knowledge he possesses, the young almost-padawan does the best he can to patch his ally up and revivify her. As Ash does so his mind races to come up with an escape plan. He smiles grimly as a thought occurs to him. Though vaguely abhorrent, it might just be effective and right now that's all that matters. He can feel bad about it later. If it works.
'Come on Captain,' Ash mutters as he administers his final treatment in the form of a stimstick, 'I'd feel better about the laserbrained thing I'm about to do if I had your help.'
Treat Injury +2… (fingers crossed! Once again, happy to spend a FP if necessary).

Squinting through the glowing illumination, Adalyn looks around at the basement as Wexel translates her words to the nest’s matron. Her attention comes back to the youngling as he likewise passes on the matron’s words. With a smile and a bow of thanks she turns for the nearest set of unoccupied cots and draws their small family together by them.
“**We should see to your wounds now Khol,**” she says with a look to Khol that argument was out of the question, she pulls from her belt one of the acquired medpacs and offers it to the young Ithorian. “**Buthbo, would you help me please.**”
Her gaze goes to the other younglings and she gives them a small reassuring smile. “**You should get some rest while you can.** ”

***When Ash touches Captain Vel to administer the stimstick a sudden weariness washes over him, causing him to pause. The fatigue is accompanied by a host of emotions, many bubbling up from within the youth and amplified by Ash's connection to the Force.
The whole kriffin' thing was unfair. Master Ruhk had finally given him some responsibility, and the whole thing blew up in his face. He may lose his family again this day, and this woman who has gone out of her way to save his life may yet lose hers!
…But Ash has the power to fix it all. If he would just draw upon the Force fully, he could heal Captain Vel and himself and then go Khol, Adalyn, and the younglings! Master Ruhk would forgive him this failure and use of the Force for all the good it would do! He just needs to use his true potential…***
Ash almost screams at the injustice of it all as he stares down at Vel through the beginnings of tears. His desire to defy everything, to make things right, almost overwhelms him. He can do it - he can do anything! He's a Jedi! A Fallanassi! Nothing and no one can stop him from achieving whatever he puts his mind to!
***As these ideas race across Ash's thoughts, a blue flash catches his attention from the corner of his eye, and when he turns his head he finds a cerulean memory moth resting on his shoulder. The great weariness he feels doesn't abate any, but as the moth alights Ash feels more fortified, as if no matter what may come he will endure. If he were to call upon the Force, it would respond to his need and heal the Captain. He need only to endure…***
Ash understands now. He has the power to revive his fallen ally, and a choice to make. A barrier has lifted within his mind and he has never so clearly understood the beauty of the Light... nor the lure of the Dark. He debates with himself over which path can serve him better now. Whether giving himself to his raw emotions is justifiable given the extreme situation, or whether to take the safer path. He realises that the greater part of his instinct is drawing to the Dark, which worries him but causes him to wonder - he has always trusted his instinct before.
Yet he suddenly realises there's a third voice fighting to be heard. Ash realises dimly that the voice is also himself.
*'You can't choose either - you don't know what you're doing! You've never trained to do this. You don't mess with the Force, you just don't. It's not a game. You could KILL her. You could kill yourself!'
'I wouldn't!'
'You* might*. Want to take the chance?'*
No, he realises. He doesn't want to take that chance. Captain Vel deserves better than to be the victim of his ego.
And he should know better than to rely on the Force. Certainly it is a part of him, as he is a part of it. But in the end the Force is as much a crutch as a tool. Hasn't he always tried to rely only on his own merit? Why should he risk everything now, when he already has a plan?
***The stimstick in Ash's hand begins to look rather small, but as he glances at it the young Jedi remembers one of Master Ruhk's lessons:
"The Force provides life, but we provide meaning. Those that do for themselves find the greatest reward."***
Yes, it was true. And Ash had never needed that lesson before - he had possessed that particular wisdom for years. He won't forget it now.
His plan will just have to work, that's all.
Jaw set, eyes grim, lips drawn thin, Ash applies the stimstick to Captain Vel's neck.

A pregnant silence follows Ash's application of the stimpak, then it is suddenly shattered by a sharp intake of break as Captain Vel sits full upright and shoves the young Jedi near half across the tilted lift car. Her eyes are wide and darting, and as she locks onto Ash their is a great deal more clarity in them than moment's before. Reaching up to her neck, the doctor removes the stim injector, looks at it and then tosses it aside.
**"What the fark kid, are you *trying*** to kill me? You could've exploded my kriffin' heart with too much adrenaline! You could've..."
The captain trails off as she looks at her hands and then runs a brief diagnosis of herself. Grunting, she shakes her head in wonder before having to catch herself as a bout of dizziness takes her.
**"Looks like the stimulant is battling the worst of my concussion symptoms, but if we make it out of here alive tomorrow is *definitely* going to suck Hutt."**
Seeming to notice Ash's battered state for the first time, Captain Vel straggles to her knees and crawls over to give the youth a quick once over. She tears strips from her lab coat, and using a canteen from her belt she begins to clean and dress Ash's wounds, moving with a surprising tenderness and alacrity given her tough nature. When she's done, Captain Vel takes a pill from her another pocket on her utility belt and hands it to Ash along with the canteen. **(Rolled a 20 on the heal, Ash is restored to full and moves +1 on the CT)**
**"Adrenal tab- not nearly as potent as a stimpak but it'll do for a scrawny nerf like you. I wish we could've got my gear from my office kid; bought it after cleaning out Colonel Shachedi in a game of strip-Sabacc. I got more on my ship though; what's our situation?"**
With her lab coat shredded, Captain Vel sheds it and underneath she wears a sharp officer's uniform, although the quality of the fabric and the way the cut of the uniform emphasizes the Corellian's physique is more than likely not to regulation. The sidearm blaster the captain draws is replete with chrome and electrum details, but the laser-sight mounted along its slide and the scoring around the muzzle show that the weapon is a great deal more than decoration. In Elarc Vel's hands, it looks downright lethal.

Khol does not object when Adalyn recommends rest and tending to his wounds- indeed it isn't until Buthbo comes over and aids Adalyn in patching his leg that the Korunnai's attention focuses with his start. His look is grim and determined, and even Adalyn's proximity doesn't elicit much further response. When finally he makes eye contact with her and the younglings, and opens his mouth to respond, a bright blinking light at his hip catches his attention. Khol snatches the commlink from his belt and flips the channel open, although he does not speak he merely listens for a response. Static fills the air, but enough audio gets through the interference to make out the voice of Captain Janders and Sergeant Switch.
**"Direct link online, sir! ***bbbrrzzttt*** Commander, can you hear me? Pl- ***bbrrzzttt*** -spond if you copy, over!"**
Vaulting to his feet, Khol ignores the sharp throbbing in his thigh as he nearly bowls Adalyn and Buthbo over. He gathers the younglings around and then motions everyone in the cramped room to silence as he responds.
**"Khol here Captain, although you're starting to breakup? What's your status, does Master Ruhk have any idea what in the Force is going on?"
"Order came down from the chancellor himself! Our bro- ***bbrrzzttt*** -hers started firin' on the Gen ***bbbrrzzttt*** -and others, started to cut them down. -tried to stop them, but ***bbbrrzzttt*** -on us too!"**
The com-feed is briefly disrupted as the sounds of explosions and blaster fire sound through the link. Khol's eyes shut tightly, and pained expression creases his forehead as he waits in agonized patience, but soon the link splutters and resumes transmission.
**"What about Master Ruhk; where is he? Did you all make it back to the ship in time?"
"Genral Ruhk- ***bbbrrrzzzttt*** -holding the docking bay. Handful of other Jedi are- ***bbbrrrzzztttt*** -in', but fadin' fast. Howler's- ***bbbbrrzzzttt*** -but alive, don't know how long he can hold. General said hold for survivors; hold for you, but- ***bbbrrrzzzttt*** -much longer. Wait… Are those?! Focus on the heavy squad! Focus on the- ***bbbrrrzzztttt***"**
Another explosion sounds through the commlink, but this time the communication feed terminates with an air of finality. Khol stands staring at the commlink while the younglings look on both Padawans with fearful gazes. Suddenly, the Korrun's hand flexes and is accompanied by the groaning protest of plastic and wiring as the small commlink crumples.
**"We must go. Now."**
The words are spoken in an icy monotone, and the air surrounding the young Jedi becomes almost palpably colder. He sweeps his gaze over the small basement for any sign of another exit, and wherever his eyes land on a cluster of Arconans they seem to reflexively recoil. Only the younglings and the lead female Arconan seem unafraid of the towering Korun, and when Khol speaks Jyzen rallies the other three around him. The female Arconan moves to impede Khol, raising her hands in a placating fashion, but as she does Adalyn can almost feel a darkness gathering in Khol, like clouds gathering into a thunderhead just before the storm breaks. The younglings seem oblivious to the danger; in fact they seem almost swept up in Khol's burgeoning fervor, and Adalyn feels that she may be on the verge of some tipping point, if she does not act soon.

Flung across the elevator, Ash lies there for a moment staring upward at the twisted wreckage of the ceiling. Somehow, he finds this very funny and begins to chuckle quietly.
'Shhhh,' he reprimands Captain Vel as she explodes at him, putting his finger to his lips and trying hard to contain real and hysterical cackling. He groans as his bruised body is wracked by the juddering threat of the impending belly-laugh. 'Soldiers outside.'
He calms visibly as Vel treats him, accepting and swallowing the offered pill.
'We don't have much time,' Ash explains, 'backup's coming. I'm going to sneak out there, lure them to the edge of the roof, then... take them out of the equation.'
The young Jedi sits up, grimacing.
'Chances are I can only get one though, so I need you ready to take the other out. We'll have to be quick, because we don't know how long we have to do it, get you out of this elevator, and get the hell out of here before the reinforcements arrive.'
Ash rises to his feet and approaches the hole, calming his breathing.
'Remember,' he says, 'be ready to take a shot. You'll know when's the right time. Either it'll be obvious or I'll screw up and it'll still be obvious.'
As quietly as possible he clambers through, then once on the other side slips into the White Current.
Picking a portion of the roof visible from the hole he just left Ash slowly and steadily approaches the edge, careful to maintain his cloak. Stopping at the edge he crouches down. From among his possessions he withdraws a hooked liquid cable dispenser.
Pointing the device straight down, Ash activates it, sending the hook crashing heavily to the rooftop. Having made this attention grabbing noise Ash quickly grabs the hook and latches it to the side of the roof, pushing the now exposed and coiling syntherope off the side so that it will look like someone is still ascending.
Even as the soldiers (hopefully) hurry to his position, Ash, still immersed in the White Current, takes a few short steps back to avoid either of them blundering into him. As soon as one (or both) of them is near the edge, he throws aside his cloak in favour of a quick push to send whichever (or both) of them plummeting from the rooftop.
He fervently hopes that if one (or both!) of the soldiers survive his little trap, that Captain Vel will realise that's her signal to fire. She should, he reflects, she's a smart lady.
Either way, his own first action in a worst case scenario is to quickly draw and ignite his lightsaber.
OOC: Obviously this is way more than one round's worth but I figure we don't really enter combat rounds unless he's caught. So all of that is obviously conditional, dependant on not being interrupted, caught, or anything similar. Let's see… Stealth +8, though that's before using Force Cloak which he'll do as soon as he's through the gap. Use the Force +8. As per the previous posts, happy to spend a FP at any time one is required to see this thing through. Would suck to fail at this point.

As the conversation unfolds, determination begins to envelop her only to be replaced by growing apprehension as she feels Khol’s own rise of emotions; not all of them positive. A growing fear he may even lash out at the matronly Arconan moves her into action as Adalyn tries to quickly place herself between the woman and the towering young Jedi.
“**Khol.** ” She starts sharply in an attempt to get his attention. “**You need to calm down. Rushing in will only serve to get us killed. What help to Master Ruhk would that be?** ” Standing her ground against him, she hopes her words and actions serve to at least temper the raging storm for the moment.
Motioning for Wexel to join her, she turns her back on her Jedi peer, trusting he had enough sense not to lash out with her back turned. “**We can’t stay any longer. Do you know of a back way to the spaceport?**”

The jagged edges of the ruptured turbolift car pull and scratch at Ash as he squeezes through an opening, but makes it through he does and relatively unscathed. It takes little effort for the nimble youth to attain a good ambush point, and when he casts his grappling hook it rebounds loudly off of the duracrete bricks of the hospital's roof.
**"Hey, you hear somethin'?"
"Yeah 'did. Best to check it out; Skipper ain't goin' anywhere and we've still got a good view of the rest of the landing…"**
Heavy footfalls crunch grit and debris as the pair of troopers march towards Ash's position. Just as they come into view Ash submerges himself in the White Current, and all the world around him takes on washed-out tones. With each approaching step the blood pulses louder in the young Jedi's ears, and only a greater intuition holds the youth in place as the hapless clone troopers tromp warily into the ambush.
**"How the… Looks like we've got a runner!"
"Must've climbed through one've the holes in the lift! Blasted quiet lil' bugger; ground command come in, it looks like we've got- AAAAHHHH!!"
"What the kriff- LookouAAAAHHH!"**
Ash springs from hiding and throws all of the muscle he can manage into the back of the reporting clone trooper, knocking him perilously off balance. The clone flails wildly, clobbering his comrade in arms in the helmet before tumbling over the side. Off-balance, the remaining trooper spins dizzily towards the edge of the roof before beginning a slow, clumsy tumble over, but just at the last moment the clone manages to catch hold of Ash's collar and drag him along for the ride!
...It is a very near thing, but Ash manages to cling to the edge of the rooftop by his fingertips. His body bounces off of the side of the hospital with a dull smack that forces the air from his longs, although the collision serves to jar the clone trooper at his collar loose. Below him, Ash hears the grotesque clatter of plastoid armor meeting pavement and shattering bone, while frantic demand for a report screeches through the clone troopers commlink before fading into a electronic-splutter.
And so Ash dangles, his strength ebbing and the sweat of his hands making attaining a better grip near impossible. From seemingly nowhere, an azure memory moth- in fact *the same*azure memory moth- alights on the youth's nose, and it takes every last ounce of Ash's concentration to not sneeze himself into an early grave.
*…This is what happens to heroes kid. They never show this part in the holovids, eh?*

Khol looms over Adalyn, visibly seething but not taking a single step forward. Wexal looks tentatively from Khol to Adalyn, but with the other Padawan's defiance the fervor that Khol seemed to have ignited quickly evaporates. The Arconan youngling scrabbles from behind the towering Koruun and goes to speak with matron of the Arconan nest, who stands with her people looking with grim apprehension at the collection of Jedi youth. When Wexal relays Adalyn's question, a quick conversation in the Arconan's clicking, chittering language ensues before the matron gives a decisive nod.
**"We know of a way. We detect heat very well, so Republic hire us to service thermal transfer pipes underground. We will take you through service tunnels."**
The tension of the situation has caused Wexal to fall back into speaking in the collective form, although he doesn't seem to notice. When everyone signals their readiness, the Arconan matron and a half-dozen Arconans armed with blasters and heavy maintenance tools lead the Jedi back into the alley. After a brief surveillance of the area, a pair of the Arconans move to open a service grate and when the entrance is clear they wave everyone inside. The service tunnels are cramped, dark, and sweltering, but the Arconans are flawless guides and it is not long before the Jedi are scaling a service ladder to climb through another grate.
Once they emerge it takes several moments for the eye to adjust to the abundance of sunlight after so long in the dark. Glancing around, the Jedi find themselves in another alley similar to the one they previously left, but the sounds of an intense firefight and the roar of repulsorlift engines echoes in the near distance. The Arconan Matron signals for the other Arconans to fallback into the service grate, and once they are all safely inside she moves to address the Jedi.
[attachment=0]<!-- ia0 -->Dantooine Settlement.jpg<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment]
**"You follow path," She points north and then towards the west, "It will take you to starport. We can go no further; we remember all that Jedi have done for us, but we must protect nest first."**
Looking each Jedi in the eye, the Arconan Matron appears to be searching for understanding and confirmation. When she has it, she offers the Jedi a sad bow and a few parting words for Wexal before disappearing into the service grate, which locks soundly behind her. Then once again the young family of Jedi are left all alone, with the sounds of battle looming just beyond them.

Blinking frantically in the sunlight, the young Jedi shields her gaze momentarily to focus on the Arconan matron. The matron’s reluctance to help any further doesn’t come as a surprise, already her nest had helped more than Adayln would have expected. It was certainly too dangerous for them to proceed any further. With a deep bow of thanks Adalyn offers the only thing she can for their help - her gratitude. “**May the Force be with you,**” she says as the matron closes the hatch to the tunnels.
It’s with grim determination she turns to her friends, their destination in sight, but still such a long way to go. The sounds of the not so distant battle a reminder of the haste that was required. With her eyes finally adjusted to the sunlight she casts a look around. The most direct route would be to move the damaged speeders out of the way, but who knew what sort of attention that would draw. Casting her gaze up, her attention was drawn to the roof of the nearest building of the port authority.
“**What do you think, Khol? Want to take a look? I can lift you onto the roof.**” Tracking around the buildings would take time, but if they were going to head into an ambush it wouldn’t be worth it.

Ash grins despite himself even as he strains to maintain his grip.
"I wasn't even expecting that to *work*, so I'm doing well," he tells the memory moth, reaching out to the syntherope dangling just a short distance away from him.
"Surviving is an optional extra," he adds, clutching at the rope in an attempt to get a good grip.

Somehow, some way, Ash finds the strength to haul himself back onto the edge of the roof, where he rolls onto his back and tries to catch his breath. The memory moth flutters around him then alights momentarily on his heaving chest.
*Good going, kid. Don't quit now.*
The glittering creature is shaken loose again as Ash comes heavily to his feet, and this time it settles on his shoulder. Apparently it's going nowhere, bonded as it is to the young very-nearly-a-padawan by the memories he has shared.
"Captain Vel," he calls, stumbling over to the elevator shaft on feet that feel like lead, "stand back, I'm going to widen the hole."

It seems like the Force is with them for the time being - Khol, Adalyn, and the subdued younglings manage to avoid any patrols on their way back to the landing pad thanks to a combination of caution, subterfuge, and luck. Yet fortune is finite as are all things, and theirs finally seems to run out.
A frantic firefight is taking place at their destination, where Atiniir Squad, Master Ruhk, and a small number of Jedi are pinned down by heavy fire as they hold the landing pad for other survivors to reach them. The road between the padawans and their Master is surprisingly clear, a weak point in the circle of death. Yet advancing from their position of cover behind a truck would make them clear targets for the snipers firing down from atop the port authority buildings around the pad. They are excellent shots: moments after your arrival a blaster bolt gets past the blurring lightsaber of a young Nautolan padawan, dropping him to the floor. Crying out in anguish a Cerean Knight who is presumably his Master leaps over the padawan's body to protect him from further shots while another padawan tries to drag his body back to the shuttle.
The younglings are fearful and verging on panic, and they look to you to take control and save them from this horror.

A pit forms in the young woman’s stomach as she looks upon the scene. *So close… we’re so close, yet so far away.* It takes what seems like a long moment before she clear the horror off her features and turn to the younglings with a look of calm. “**It’s alright.. once we get there this will all be over. We’re almost there,**” she puts in as much confidence as she can, even though at the moment she may not be entirely convincing herself it was ultimately important the younglings didn’t know it.
Turning to Khol, she motions him aside, but speaks loud enough that the younglings nearby can hear them. “**I have a plan, but we have to act quickly. Take Depik and get the truck hot-wired, the rest of us are going to look for a crate to use as cover.**”

Khol takes a lurching step towards the firefight before Adalyn's voice brings him up short. He clutches his lightsaber so tightly in his right hand that his knuckles audibly crack, and the sense of barely-constrained fury and urgency comes from him in almost-palpable waves. When the Nautolan padawan is struck down, it takes every remaining shred of Khol's restraint to keep him from charging to the Cerean master's aid. Instead, he curtly gestures for Depik to follow him toward the front of the speeder truck and once there he expends some small amount of pent up aggression in violently "teasing" open the door.

Adalyn watches the Korunnai for a moment, worried that he wasn’t going to listen and charge in after all, an act which would be detrimental to their immediate survival. If Khol charged the younglings would probably follow them and in the end the snipers would take them down one by one with Khol and Adalyn nearly helpless to defend them. While her idea would take more time, it meant better odds of survival; particularly for the younglings. Turning away from Khol and the truck, leaving the task to her counterpart, she draws in the others and makes a quick dash for the array of large cargo crates. Reaching out with the Force she tries to gather which ones might seem like the most likely of candidates wasting only a few moments at each crate before moving on. With any which are promising she makes quick work of the locks with her lightsaber trying to keep the door as intact as possible.

Khol pulls on the truck's door and the magnetic lock simply gives, the Khorunnai unconsciously calling upon the Force to aid him in his anger.
Dimly, he is aware of the teachings instilled in him by Master Ruhk: continuing as he is is dangerous. Yet the theory and the practice are such wildly different things, and no lessons or any amount of meditation could have prepared him for something like this.
Without prompting Depik crawls up into the cab, seeming to understand what is required.
Adalyn manages to keep control of her feelings better than the other padawan, and gives herself over to the Force. There are several large storage crates on the truck's flatbed, big enough to contain both her and the remaining Zakkegs, albeit in a very cramped fashion, and assuming one were completely empty.
She has a good feeling about a crate at the rear of the truck. She discovers that there is no cause to use her lightsaber: for whatever reason the box is both unlocked and unoccupied.

Glancing into the crate, Adalyn grabs a glow rod from her belt and tosses the activated light source inside. “**Alright, come on now. This is going to be our ride home.**” Helping the younglings inside a part of her is counting the moments ticking by. Every moment they delayed another of the ship’s defenders was getting shot down. *Too long… Not much longer. Hold on.* She pleas silently.
“**Get as close to the back as you can. That’s it, you’re doing great!**” she says, hoping some encouragement would lighten their spirits. She can’t show them how concerned she is, they're frightened enough already. With all of the Zakkegs in the crate, she makes her way to the front to see how Dejak and Khol are coming.

Khol slides into the driver seat, although he gives Depik enough room to access the electronics under the dashboard.
**"After you get this thing running get up here, keep your head down, and stay small. You won't have time to crawl into the back once we get rolling."**
He wasn't an ace pilot by an measure, Atiniir squad and the survivors of the Battle of Jabiim would certainly attest to that, but he did know the controls. And, as he wryly thought to himself, it won't take much skill or flare to do what they were intending on doing.
**"Everyone hang on tight… We'll be home soon."**
It surprises him how steady his voice sounds in comparison to the maelstrom of emotion surging through him. Khol may have spoken those words as a rally for the others, but internally he makes a vow to himself; He would see them home- ALL of them home- no matter what it takes. Once Adalyn is in the cab and everyone is secure, the young Korun opens the throttle all the way and makes for the cruiser. For home.

Having freed Captain Vel from the elevator Ash helps her across to the starship, then turns to watch the skies as she punches in an access code.
His vigilance is fortunate. Even as the hatch opens he catches sight of a gunship approaching fast from over the rooftops.
"Their reinforcements are coming," he says tensely, "hurry!"
He pushes Elarc inside and follows her in, watching the gunship get rapidly larger while he waits for the hatch to close and the Captain makes her way through the ship to the cockpit.
It is, he realises, going to be a very close thing.

---

Depik squeaks excitedly as she succeeds in bypassing the repulsortruck's ignition safeties, then scrambles up into the passenger side seat while Khol guns it. Adalyn has just gotten inside the crate with the younglings, who huddle close in the dark once it is closed behind them. Such is the size and weight of the crates that they remain in place even as the truck throttles toward the landing pad and while it is certainly not a smooth ride the box's occupants are at no great risk of dashing themselves against the sides.
Khol is dazzled as blaster fire ignites around the truck, soldiers on both sides of the battle opening up on the vehicle assuming it is some ploy by the opposition. Then there is a moment of calm as no one fires at all, unsure now whether the truck's driver is an enemy or ally. He sees Master Ruhk's eyes widen in recognition as the truck approaches, and the Jedi Master shouts something to his allies. Atiniir Squad open fire again, strafing the surrounding buildings to keep the enemy busy. Taking advantage of the distraction, the Cerean Jedi stoops to help pull her padawan into cover - and incidentally out of the way of the speeding truck.
As the truck approaches the shuttle Khol breaks hard and pulls the wheel to the left, the truck turning sharply and coming to an abrupt stop sideways, its bulk now providing additional cover for the defenders. The younglings yelp in pain as they and Adalyn are thrown sideways, knocking the crate open and spilling out, but at least they are on the side of the flatbed nearest the shuttle.

Khol ducks as low as his lumbering frame allows him to, as blaster fire riddles the speeder truck with scorched pockmarks. After he interposes the vehicle in the middle of the firing line, he reaches over Depik and shoves the passenger-side door open. The Korunnai wastes no time in scooping the diminutive Rodian up as he half-crawls-half-shimmies his way out of the truck, using his wider body as a shield against the blaster fire.
Once outside of the truck, and firmly shielded from blaster fire by the vehicle, Khol sets Depik down then moves to unload everyone else from the truck's rear. He still clutches his inactive lightsaber in his offhand, but with his prodigious strength still manages the task of unloading the Zakkegs and Adalyn one-handed and with little trouble.
**"We move as one; heads down and as fast as your legs go! Adalyn'll lead, I'll pull up the rear, and no matter what happens to us you four don't stop until you're on the ship with Master Ruhk! Everyone hear me?"**
The elder padawan takes a moment to look each youngling in the eye until he receives affirming nods from everyone. At last he settles on Adalyn, but then quickly looks away as another flurry of emotions washes over him, threatening to damage whatever calm he has remaining. Khol then ignites his lightsaber, the azure blade snap-hissing to life as he prepares himself for the task at hand.
*Whatever it takes, no matter the cost…*

The young Jedi bracers herself within the small confines of the crate, preparing herself for the rough ride she knows is inevitable as Khol pilots the truck toward the landing pad. As the truck takes blaster fire, she winces. Trapped within the confines of the crate they had only the metal of the constructs between them and death. That is, if Khol’s driving didn’t kill them first. *Calm.. must stay calm.*
Having taking position near the entrance of the crate she’s the first to come crashing out as Khol’s breaking turn maneuver dislodges them from their impromptu sanctuary of the cargo crate. She is dazed for a moment during which she tries to determine if she’s broken anything. With only some bruising, she hauls herself to her feet and turns to the closet of the younglings helping them to their feet looking them over for any serious injuries. “**Come on now, to your feet. Almost there!**” she says over the near overwhelming din of blaster fire. She’s grateful when Khol shows up helping her to collect the Zakkegs. There was just one final stretch; getting into the ship itself. *Just a bit further.* As the Korunnai meets her gaze, she can not only see but sense the tumultuous feelings in them before he looks away. Something inside of her is drawn to the surface and it too takes all her self control to maintain her persona of calm.
Drawing her own blade, the emerald blade flashes to life in her grasp and she makes ready to lead the way, preparing herself for the worst as she makes the dash toward the ship and safety.

The younglings continue to show nerve beyond their years, though they are anything but calm. They take their cues from Adalyn and Khol, striving to emulate the outer poise of the older padawans who are right now their very real heroes.
Now outside the relative safety of the truck, the padawans quickly realise despite the cover of the vehicle their position is not paritcularly safe. Fire is coming at the defenders from all sides. The Jedi rush forward to block incoming fire, deflecting it away from the new arrivals, while Atiniir Squad continue to hunker down behind crates and barrels, sporadically popping up from behind cover to pepper enemy positions with suppression fire.
Master Ruhk joins them by the truck, and his relief to see them all well is palpable.
"Hurry," he insists while gesturing behind him at the open door of the shuttle, "get the younglings on board."
The Feeorin catches Khol's eye, and his padawan sees the deep despair and fatigue he feels mirrored in the Jedi Master's expression. Ruhk doesn't ask after Ash. He knows why the youth is absent, and that there is nothing to be done. He also knows who is responsible.
Ushered along by their Master, Adalyn, Khol, and the younglings rush across the distance toward the shuttle. The other Jedi fall back around them. Suddenly Adalyn pauses in her retreat, experiencing a certain sense of impending danger. She spins around, her gaze drawn instinctively to a rooftop behind them. She is not the only one. Behind them, Ruhk has also turned to face the threat.
A squad of clone troopers rises from cover behind the rooftop's parapet, bringing rocket launchers to bear. They fire almost in unison, a salvo of the missiles shrieking towards the Jedi.
Adalyn's reaction is immediate and instinctive, reaching out with the Force to turn the deadly incendiaries aside. Between her and Ruhk, almost every rocket is redirected, and the first everyone who wasn't so quick to react knows about them is a series of explosions coming from the surrounding buildings. Yet one rocket find a target on the landing pad: it rips into the cab of the flatbed, and the truck is thrown into the air, billowing flames. The force of the explosion knocks Adalyn from her feet, and everyone shields their eyes against the sudden flare. There is an almighty crash and screech as the truck hits the ground and skids across the stone, followed by the sound of several smaller explosions as various of its advanced systems are consumed.
Even as their sight and hearing are overwhelmed by the adjacent explosion, Ruhk's padawans hear his voice in their mind, relaying a message both rushed and pained.
*Get to Bespin! The encl-*
His message is cut off in the middle, and it is soon clear why. Master Ruhk sprawls on the ground, legs crushed under the overturned flatbed, flesh burnt and his clothes still on fire. His lightsaber has fallen a few metres away, switched off automatically by the dead man's switch.

**"Get on the ship and go to Bespin…"**
Khol's voice is barely more than a harsh whisper and as he begins to stride away from the boarding ramp to where Master Ruhk lays pinned, it is almost as if a dark haze trails in his wake. Those sensitive to the Force near the young Korun feel a dreadful rage rolling off of him in waves. As he doggedly marches towards his fallen master, the padawan comes under fire from the entrenched clone trooper squads. He deflects and and evades as many blaster bolts as he can; those he can't leave sizzling blisters all over his body, but he ignores the pain.
*Save them all… Whatever it takes… No matter the cost…*
The mantra runs through his thoughts over and over again as he draws ever closer to Master Ruhk's prone form. Red strands of light cross his vision, whether it was the after image of blaster fire or due to his injuries he doesn't know and doesn't care; yet as he blinks the strands still linger, and they appear to somehow connect the troopers together. From trooper-to-trooper, building-to-squad, and from assaulting army to the cruiser behind him, everything was interconnected. But at some points the strands were much more significantly; innately he knows that if he strikes the focal points and break the ties, he will sever the clone troopers connections to his family.
*Break the strands… Whatever it takes… No matter the cost…*
He had never had a great affinity for telekinesis, but with his current mindset he feels a resurgence in the force. Khol extends a hand towards the smoldering truck bed crushing his master, and with a simple gesture the remnants of the vehicle lifts into the air. A flick of the wrist sends it hurtling at the rooftop where the rockets had launched, where it collides with tremendous force. He looks down his master, the Feeorin's chest barely heaving, and the sight fills him with an even more terrible strength.
*I can save them- No, I will save them! All I have to do is break the strands! Whatever it takes… No matter the cost…*

Stunned by the force of the blast, Adalyn is slow to get up from where she has fallen. The air knocked out of her, she gasps and only when she’s recovered enough does she sit up. It takes a longer moment for her to process the macabre scene around her and Master Ruhk’s final message. Shock keeps her rooted in place, her eyes remaining on her teacher’s still form. *He’s gone… No, he can’t be.* While she wants to deny it, she knows the truth.
Khol’s dulled words bring her out of her shock and she stands as quickly as she’s able. Her body objecting from the abuse it’s been taking. Adalyn follows behind Khol obstinately, knowing full well her actions would probably rise his ire further. Someone had to stand up to him and make him see the stupidity in his actions. “**Don’t be an idiot,** she says following behind, defending herself the best she can. Not as skilled in her deflection with a lightsaber she uses her learned ability to negate and absorb the blaster energy as it hits her body. “**Master Ruhk wouldn’t want you to die here and Force help me I won’t let you either!**”
She stops, standing over the burnt shell that had been her teacher. The burning truck had become his funeral pyre, they would have to leave him where he had fallen. Glancing on his lightsaber hilt, she draws it to her with the Force, the hilt sliding lightly across the paracrete to her. What Khol does next distracts her from effort to recover their fallen master's lightsaber. While she had felt the anger radiating off of him, it hadn't been a new occurance though before he hadn't necessarily acted on it. Now, however, she could sens the anger coming off him in palpable waves and could feel him using it to severe the burning wreckage into pieces before using the Force to hurl it toward the source of the missiles. She visibly winces as she feels him draw on the dark side.
"**Khol, please…**" she shouts. "**Let's get out of here. We can all leave together!**"

Despite the distance between them Ash can somehow feel the anger overwhelming his Korunnai friend and adoptive brother as though he were there with him, and he halts in his journey to the cockpit, clutching at his head.
"No, no, no!" he screams, tears born of frustration at his own impotence springing to his eyes. "What's happening, Khol, what are you doing?"
"What happened kid?" Vel shouts fearfully back from her position in the cockpit, but she doesn't dare go back to check on him even when she hears no response. There's simply no time.
The transport rises sharply, wobbling inelegantly due to Vel's haste to bring it up. The sublight drives screech agonisingly as the medic tries to draw from the ship its top speeds without wasting time on a gradual acceleration. She is not inexperienced at desperate maneuvers, and knowledgeable about their potential risks, so she knows better than to push it too far past its limitations. The ship survives Vel's rough handling, though its ion engines may now be in desperate need of a check-up.
The Captain has earned a few more seconds of respite but the gunship closes fast, blasters opening fire as it comes within extreme range. Vel immediately executes evasive maneuvers.
"Kid!" she cries, and risks diverting her attention for a split-second to look wildly over her shoulder, "I need you to strap in!"
Once again there is no reply. Ash *cannot* reply: stunned by the furious emotional flood, and unprepared for the sharp evasive movements, he was thrown from his feet headfirst into the protruding corner of an access hatchway. Out cold, he lies on the hard metal floor with blood slowly welling from a gash on his forehead.

So consumed is he by his emotions Khol unwittingly gives himself over to the Dark Side, and his rage is such that he seems to phyiscally project a dark miasma.
The rational part of his mind cannot draw him back, drowned out by the violence and the horror. By the sight of Master Ruhk. By the screams and cries of the younglings, forced to watch their beloved Master burn.
It is too much.
Roaring like an animal, Khol draws on the limitless potential of the Dark Side, and he marvels at the power, at the wonderful way it feels as it courses through him. He throws his arms upwards, and the repulsortruck is scooped into the air as though weightless and flung hard towards the troopers on the parapet. The vehicle crashes against the rooftop, the soldiers disappearing beneath it, and the violent impact causes the already ruined shell to crumple.
As Adalyn tries to reason with the other padawan, she steps over the body of her Master. Her eyes are drawn morbidly to his charred body, and she gasps in surprise.
Although barely perceptible, his chest rises and falls. Somehow, after all that punishment, he's still alive! Master Ruhk is a Feeorin of advancing age, and that makes him a tough old kriffer. For how long though? His clothes are still aflame, and his burns and crushed limbs require immediate and serious medical attention of a kind not available right now. There might be some decent medical supplies on the *Aegis*, enough to keep Ruhk alive until they can get him into a bacta tank. But there's no time to lose, and she is faced with a terrible choice. Will she try to bring Khol back from the brink of the Dark Side and risk the death of her Master, or will she save her Master's life and risk losing Khol?

Adalyn doesn’t think, but reacts as she drops to her master’s side her lightsaber disengaging before she drops it to the paracrete beside her. “**He’s alive! Master Ruhk is alive!**” She repeats the words over and over hoping Kohl will hear them and snap out of it as she struggles for a a moment to remove her cloak. “**Khol, he’s alive!**” she shouts a final time using the fabric to put out the remaining blaze and cover the burnt flesh. “**You have to help me! He’ll die if we don’t get him to the ship.**”
The young woman risks looking up at her fellow padawan, but she’s forced to avert her eyes. She has to act now before she loses everything. Jumping to her feet she grabs Khol’s outstretched hand, prepared for the violent outburst the act would bring. Readying her innate ability with the Force she prepares to lash out him, to stop him with a burst capable of overloading his senses. “**You have to snap out of it! We can still save him!**” she pleads, her voice breaking with the accumulation of emotions roiling inside her.

Fresh tears brim the Korun's eyes. He had endured much in the Crucible's slave pits, but none that had prepared him for the raw emotion he now feels. Khol takes one firm step away from Adalyn and Master Ruhk, and then another, stopping a few meters just in front of them. The padawan begins to weave his lightsaber blade in slow, yet intricate patterns around himself and with each passing moment the weave becomes faster, the pattern more intense, until it appears almost an oblate azure sphere surrounds him.
**"Take Master Ruhk, head for the ship, and don't look back! I will buy you time… "**
Khol's voice is a harsh monotone, and he doesn't so much as look back to see if Adalyn is doing as he beckons. Through the Force, a crimson lattice overlays his vision with each lifeform, object, and space forming a node within the pattern. Where his gaze lands on a node his vision sharpens and he gains some fractured understanding of the focal point's significance: a dead officer leads to a disorganized and routed command; a toppled building blocks access to the spaceport; a surprise attack on an anti-vehicle squad rounding the avenue secures the *Aegis*'s escape...
The moment Khol's eyes land on the anti-vehicle clone trooper squad, an almost-feral snarl rips forth from his lips and before anyone can react, the Korun is sprinting across the blaster scorched expanse with Force-borne speed. The snarl sounds almost alien to his ears, and drudges up memories he had long buried, but rather than shy away from the feelings he immerses himself in them and uses the emotion to gain the strength he now needs safeguard his family.
*They hurt Master Ruhk! They took Ash and killed the others! If you don't stop them they'll take Adalyn, and the younglings, and everything else from you, just like before! Break the strands, no matter the cost… No matter the cost… No matter the cost…*
**"…Goodbye Adalyn."**
He knew that voice; it was his own, truly himself, and it felt good to hear it before what was likely to be his end. Khol has few precious moments to contemplate before he sets upon the troopers, and his world turns all to pain, rage, and purpose.

“**I didn’t mean that kind of help,**” Adalyn remarks as Khol turns away from her, moving away purposefully from them; his blade becoming a blue hazed barrier. Before she can stop him he’s bounded away and she’s left to follow his wishes begrudgingly. Moving back to Master Ruhk’s side, she first grabs hers then Ruhk’s lightsaber, clipping them to her belt to keep her hand free.
Knowing she’d be unable to carry or even drag the injured master’s bulk, the young Jedi focuses on his form, lifting the Feeorin with the aid of the Force. Moving with him she makes all haste back to the ship, while still maintaining her concentration.

Adalyn lifts Master Ruhk's body with the Force as gently as she can, but even this most painless of levitations causes a moan of agony to escape from the Feoorin's burnt lips. She hurries to the ramp of the cruiser, up which the handful of Jedi survivors are already retreating, one young twi'lek padawan herding the Zakkeg Clan ahead of her.
Last come Atiniir Squad, Sergeant Switch stoically carrying a wounded Lieutenant Howler as Captain Janders fires controlled burst shots through the fire and smoke at distant clone troopers.
She has hardly stepped foot on the ramp when it slowly begins to rise, and by the time she reaches the top it is past the horizontal plane and rapidly closing. She turns to look for Khol, but the tortured young man is nowhere to be found. All Adalyn sees is a burning, broken glimpse of the planet, and an absence where her two fellow padawans should be. If there were any mercy in the Galaxy they would be there, appearing by some miracle out of the chaos just in time to take off with her. Just in time to stay with her. To stay safe. But the Galaxy is not that kind.
The cruiser judders as the engines ignite, and Adalyn quickly grasps hold of the nearest secured object to keep her feet steady as the ship hurriedly takes off.
Behind her Janders plucks Master Ruhk from the air with surprising gentility and follows Switch and Howler to the cruiser's small medical station. It was never designed for the long-term treatment of the kind of injuries the Master has sustained, but the Force willing the supplies available should keep him stable for now and reduce his pain. His own innate Force talent should aid his recovery also.
Adalyn finds the Zakkeg Clan strapping in with the other passengers, and with little left to do she joins them. The younglings are openly crying, even Jyzen, and she cannot blame them. Nor does she know how to comfort them.
As the cruiser rises above the city, gunships scramble to intercept it, but the airspeeders are too far away and have no hope of catching the powerful starship in time to prevent it escaping.
Neither is it the only ship escaping. As Adalyn peers out of a port she catches a glimpse of a transport in the distance, climbing steeply as it exits through the planet's atmosphere, leaving the gunship tailing it helplessly behind. The sight fills her with a temporary sense of relief, knowing that there are others who are not yet lost. Yet her relief for the unknown people aboard that ship is short-lived. Her worries are more immediate - they aren't safe yet.
What terrifies her most of all is that with the Chancellor - no, the selfproclaimed *Emperor* - declaring them war criminals and fugitives, it is likely that none of them will be truly safe ever again.
