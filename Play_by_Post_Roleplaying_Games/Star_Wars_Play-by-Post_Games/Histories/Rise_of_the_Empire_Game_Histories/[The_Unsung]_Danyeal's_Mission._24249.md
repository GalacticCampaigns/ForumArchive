# [The Unsung] Danyeal's Mission.

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-28 19:32:40)

As Danyeal sat in the comfort of the bed, Kari, the Chancellor's personal droid came into the room and looked at both Danyeal and Esrynn.
> **Kari wrote:**

> I hope that I&#39;m not interrupting anything *important*. However, the Chancellor would like a word with you.

Kari motions for Danyeal and Esrynn to follow.

As Danyeal sighs quite loudly at the Droids intrusion.
"Well of course not, I mean it would be odd for us to be in "our" personal room and think we would be doing anything important."
After he gets himself ready he follows the Droid with Esrynn.

Kari looks at the human quizzically for a moment.
> **Kari wrote:**

> I would remind you, Master Young, that these quarters are yours on loan, as a gift from Chancellor Fyor.

However, the droid doesn't say anything else as she leads the couple through the hallways of the Chancellor's suites to his personal office. The entire way, Esrynn holds Danyeal's hand.
After a minute, they enter the grand offices of the Supreme Chancellor, who is sitting behind this desk this time, looking over various holo-documents. As you enter, Kari walks over to the Chancellor and announces you. He looks up at you and smiles, rising from his chair and coming around to grasp you by the arm.

> Master Young! I&#39;m so glad to see you up and about again. I&#39;d begun to worry that those security forces of ours had stunned you a bit too hard. However, now that you&#39;re mended, I have an assignment I&#39;d like you to take on. I think it may be right up your alley. After reading Esrynn&#39;s report, I noticed something that we didn&#39;t have time to figure out in the hustle and the bustle. Do you remember the cargo ship that had gone missing a few weeks ago? I&#39;d like you to track down that vessel if you could, and find out some information from the captain. Firstly, is he still shipping stolen arms around the galaxy? Because, if he is, we&#39;d like to know about it. Also, who put him in contact with the Maw Group? Was it himself? Is there another contact? This information could be very valuable to us.
> Now, I&#39;ve already spoken with Esrynn here and she said she&#39;d accompany you for backup. I don&#39;t want you to bring the man in all by yourself, or even with the backup of Esrynn here. I just want you to gather the information and report back to me. I can then send armed security forces to arrest those who need arresting. So, interested?

Danyeal shrug's his shoulders as he replies, "I guess I could lend a hand, so when do we start?"
Danyeal was not expecting to much from this new mission but then again he could always find some way to spice it up.

The Chancellor smiles and hands over a data card to Danyeal.
> **Fyor wrote:**
>
> That contains the location of the captain of the ship, as of the last time we knew. He tends to frequent a cantina around here known as the Drunken Rancor. Something about the dancers there. Either way, you&#39;ll most likely find him there. Any information you could gather would be most useful.

With that, the Chancellor turns and sits back down at his desk. Esrynn tugs on Danyeal's hands and begins to guide him out of the room.
> **Esrynn wrote:**
>
> Come on *leanÃ¡n*. I&#39;m going to make sure you don&#39;t leave my sight. Especially not in the presence of dancing females.

As Danyeal and Esrynn exit the offices, they find a nondescript speeder waiting for them with the keys inside.

As Danyeal helps Esrynn into the speeder he hops into the driving seat.
"Well then let's go make friends with this Captain and his friends.....and maybe a dancer or two..."
Danyheal accelerates the speeder as he pilots it towards the Drunken Rancor.
Along the way he lets his mind contemplate how far this thing is going to go and how best to make it play out his way.

[Music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52z8Fl5QdY "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52z8Fl5QdY")
As Danyeal and Esrynn enter the Drunken Rancor, their ears are treated to a wonderful melody and the sight of females of various species dancing about the establishment. To one side, he sees a Duros and a Rodian dropping credit chips on a stage for a human female dancer. However, Esrynn quickly points his attention towards a Aqualish who is apparently getting a private dance number from a particularly attractice blue skinned female Twi'lek. He also notices a Gamorrean is keeping guard at the door and a female Zeltron is serving drinks. Esrynn leans over to whisper in Danyeal's ear.

As Esrynn finishes her statement, the Zeltron saunters over and asks if they want a drink.

"Just follow my lead leanÃ¡n." Danyeal whispers to Esrynn.
Danyeal then nods at the waitress "Of course we would like two of whatever our Aqualish friend is having, and if you would be so kind as take him another drink and let him know we would like a few moments of his time regarding a business transaction."
Danyeal then slips 100 Credits to the Waitress then hands her another 300 Credits "Please see that our Aqualish friend get's those credits with his drink, we will be over at the far booth."
Danyeal then escorts Esrynn with him over to the booth in the back corner.
"Let us see if we can convince our new friend that he needs us as friends to protect his special transaction as his security, if we can convince him to get another meeting with us we should be able to pull this off no problem."

Danyeal watches as the Zeltron takes the money with a coy smile, and slides the chip into a strategic location under her shirt. She winks at you as she struts away towards the bar. Esrynn raises an eyebrow at Danyeal as the couple finds the corner booth and takes a seat. After a minute, the Zeltron returns with your drinks. After delivering yours, she walks over to the Aqualish and walks in front of him to place his drinks on the table in front of him, bending over so as to give him a remarkable view of her credit hiding spot before removing the chip and handing it over. As she whispers some words in his ears, he turns his head and looks back at the two of you before waving you over.

Danyeal nods at the Aqualish and turns to Esrynn to whisper "Let me make a deal with our new friend, if you would be a dear I need you to contact our "mutual employer" to let him know our shipment of illicit good need to be set up in a private hangar and the schedule for security in the area, an open window in two hours would be best, after you know the location please interrupt us to let me know it is ready for inspection."
Danyeals gets up and heads over to the Aqualish with his drink and nods as he takes a seat next to him.
"I believe introduction are in order, but as professional prudence and experience have taught me , you may call me Mr. Blue for the time being."
Danyeal takes a sip form his drink, trying not to show how strong it was to him.
"I believe we may have a potential business venture together but only if your interested, so I must ask are you interested?"
*Deception: +14*

Esrynn nods to Danyeal before retrieving her comlink and whispering into the reciever.
The Aqualish barely turns his head away from the dancing Twi'lek flaunting her stuff on the stage. The occasional whoop is let loose. He does, however answer the question.
> **Aqualish wrote:**

> Well, Mr. Blue. That depends on what kind of *venture* you&#39;ve got in mind. I&#39;m just a humble shipping captain, known for his prompt and *hassle free* deliveries. Are you in need of such a business man?

"Yes I believe you will be able to handle the venture I have in mind, I shouldn't be surprised though as my employer, whom paid me quite a lot to forget his name mind you, was recommended to you by a particular revolutionary in the politics whom I assume you must have met before or know of."
Danyeal takes another swig of his drink and carefully watches for a response from the Captain.
*Deception: +14 and Perception +8 to sense Deception from the Captain*

The Aqualish, never taking his eyes off of the dancing Twi'lek, shakes his head.

Why just the other day, I shipped some *sensitive* material for a client. I didn&#39;t ask questions and so didn&#39;t have to answer any. I honestly don&#39;t care about your politics, or those of your employer, sir. All I care about is that I get paid for transporting your, *merchandise* to wherever it needs to go. If your employer has disagreements with the current regime, then helping them out is simply hedging my bets against any possible &#8230; *changes in the market*.
> So, you need shipping of something that I take it to be of a *sensitive* nature. I can guarantee safe passage for your merchandise, for the right price, of course. Where you shipping out to?

Danyeal can tell that the captain is running his usual spill so he can't be charged with anything, but he's not lying either.

"Fair enough, now I should have the cargo available for you inspection in a few hours."
Danyeal sips the last of his drink and continues
"I have been having to move the cargo to new locations due to the recent increase in political affairs, as much of a pain as it is, it does keep unwanted guests from knowing where the cargo is."
Danyeal then looks over at Esrynn trying to see how the process is coming and looks back at the Captain.
"I trust you can have your ship ready for transportation after the inspection?"

Esrynn looks up from her comlink and catches Danyeal's eyes. She nods silently to the human.
The Aqualish captain nods his head as he continues to watch the dancer.
> **Aqualish wrote:**

The Aqualish begins laughing at that last comment, never taking his eyes off of the blue Twi'lek.

Danyeal catches the nod and turns back to the Aqualish Captain.
"Well then considering my job, perhaps we should all become friends but first if you wouldn't mind allow me a moment with my associate to discuss the inspection time and location."
Dabyeal excuses himself and heads over to Esrynn.
"Well how is our status?"

Whispering, Esrynn looks at Danyeal and smiles.

The Chancellor has agreed to turn the Coruscant Security Forces the other way, but says he can&#39;t be directly linked to weapons. He does, however, suggest that there might be someone in the military, say at the Blue Sector Base Depot, who might be willing to *lose* some weapons. Chancellor suggests that this could net two birds with one stone. He says that they&#39;ve been looking for evidence on this officer for sometime, and it would allow us the material we need to ship to catch these others. What do you say?
