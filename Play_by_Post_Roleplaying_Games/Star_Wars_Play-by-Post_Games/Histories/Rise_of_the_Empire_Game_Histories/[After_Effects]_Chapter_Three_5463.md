Jace is the first to arrive worn and dirt Jace smells of fumes, outside what was his speeder bike lays on the ground smoldering it has seen its last ride. Jace sits at the side of the room eyes closed legs crossed, Jace has grown a bit in the last few years there is wisdom in his eyes and even anger. Jace has done his job and worked the farm as he was told but has also spent long trips alone into the desert. As each of you enter without opening his eyes Jace nods to each of you, it is not until you are all present the Jace ends his meditation and stands. "Well meet I am glad you have all made it. "
(( The speeder was all he could afford with the 600 credits a junker speeder bike with a worn out engine on its last leg. Its up to Rowen if it can be repaired though it would still have the junker template on it ))

After a long footwalk, Ganthos arrives at the conference room. Upon arrival, he spots a nearly wrecked speeder bike outsdie, and his danger sense immediately starts to tingle. He closes his eyes and reaches out with the Force. As he detects only a single prescense inside, he smiles and enters.
"Hello Jace, IÂ´d have guessed youÂ´d beat me here"
Not wanting to disturb his friends meditation, he takes a seat. His trusted blaster hangs at his side, and close nearby another weapon, one that he had practiced with a lot during the last years. He feels secure having it at his side, but it still pains him to think about how he aquired it.

As Ganthos settles, a tall red battle droid stalks into the room. Its metal head swivels, sweeping the chamber from left to right, the three glowing crimson sensor-lights in triangular configuration blinking rapidly. Red looks as battered and war-torn as ever, the scratching of his paintwork and denting of his frame serving to remind all who see him that this is a droid that is good at its function, a survivor of many battles. Of course, the scouring winds of Tatooine have also made their mark over the last few years.
'My greetings to you, organics.' Red comments in his incongruously cultured voice as he backs to the rear wall. 'Still playing with over-sized glowsticks, I see.'
Even as he says so he raises one heavy arm - the one which he has modified to integrate a blaster carbine - in the direction of the door, the carbine's muzzle revealing itself, just in case the next person through the door isn't someone who should be there.

The point is to arrive neither early nor late: Dor is a master at such matters.
The door is opened, and a slender, almost delicate-seeming man enters the room. Spotting the weapon trained upon the door, he speaks in a rather soft tenor drawl, laden with the accents of Tatooine, "Are you that unhappy to see me?"
Hand rising, he brushes a lock of jet-black hair from his brow, and moves forward into the room. Gaze lingering upon the podium, he moves to find a seat, pulling it out slowly and sliding bonelessly into it. Long, narrow fingers tap upon the edge of the table as he murmurs, "Anyone hear anything more than the communique?" Mere curiosity, apparently from his tone, the question directed towards everyone as he tucks a leg underneath him.

Red's voice takes on a long-suffering tone.
'One of these days, I will be listened to when I remind you people that as a droid I cannot feel happiness or unhappiness, except perhaps a false derivative if my programming allows for it. If I have such a buried treasure of near human emotion in my memory banks, however, I have yet to find it. I will be glad to keep it that way.'

Mace enters the conferance room looking like he had just got done repairing a ships engines. "Hello everyone Name is Mace Jodo, sorry for my apperance I just got done doing some work on one of transports that broke down in the dock area." Mace moves to take a seat at the table. "Anyone know what this is all about?"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-10 09:35:24)

"I see no one has made an attempt to configure your behaviour core yet, Red. Good to see you"
Ganthos nods to the new faces.
"Nice to meet you all, Mace, Dor. IÂ´m Ganthos Vann, former CorSec officer and now mercenary since a couple of years"

'The people I meet either pay me to behave as I do or are too busy running for their lives to give it much consideration.' Red acknowledges to Ganthos. 'I suppose it is a nice change to see someone I don't have to incapacitate as well.'
The droid's head then turns back to the parting doors, swiveling to follow Casi as she enters and puts on her little show then appears to fall asleep.
'The company I am expected to keep is stimulating as always.' He comments.

Kligur stumbles in, blinking around the meeting room with large red eyes. A long-fingered hand quickly strays to the blaster at his hip before he recognizes those assembled. He blinks twice more before straightening up, using the excuse of adjusting his bantha-leather spacer jacket to cover the previous stumble.
"Oh, good, you're not *them*. Its when you *don't* stumble that they get you. Good to see everyone in one piece."

"I don't have much," Dor says to Red, still speaking in that drawl, sounding much like a Tatooine moisture farm-hick. "Leave me my sarcasm." He stretches, pulling his leg further underneath him within the chair as he glances towards the doorway as more people enter.
"Ah, Casi. Pleasure to see you as always," He says with a hint of irony, perhaps in response to her aloof manner. "Doing well, I trust?"

The doors part and a lengthy main in drab desert uniform quickly makes his way down the aisle toward the podium. His short cut black hair is neatly combed over and they way he holds his shoulders lead you to believe heâ€™s known life in the military for quite some time.
He sets the papers on the podium and looks up, his steel blue eyes seem a stark contrast to his desert tan and dark hair.
He shuffles the papers, glancing at each in turn. â€œOkay, it looks like your all here. If you would please take your seats we can get started.â€ He motions to the many desks then turns to Red. â€œYou can stand as always.â€

Red nods an acknowledgment of the man's allowance, continuing to stand at the back of the conference room rather than take a seat.

"Well, you never know who they are. They can be everywhere you know," Dor says idly, unable to resist prodding lightly. At the woman's words, he grins, and says, "I can agree there," voice still lingering in that drawl.
As the man enters, Dor turns his attention towards him, leaning an arm on the desk and focusing upon the fellow. He doesn't speak, simply relaxes, reading to listen. Almost idly, his fingers tap upon the surface of the table in a random rhythm.

As the man enters the room, Ganthos eyes him carefully. He appears to be a seasoned soldier. Ganthos scans him for any sign of armament, and then he turns his gaze around the room, inspecting the others there. Carefully, he reaches out with the Force, touching all the individuals in the room, seeking for any hint of Force Sensitivity in them.

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-12 18:25:01)

Unimpressed with the new arrival Jace puts his feet up on the table and sits back comfortably. Jace eyes the man as if to measure him up " Lets get this over with, whats the deal we where told we would get some info. Who are you anyway?"
(( Jace reaches out with the force but not only to check for force sensitive individuals but to determine if there is anyone close by that we can not see.))

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **Anazider** (2008-01-12 20:14:05)

Kligur slides into one of the offered seats, blinking at the tall uniformed man. He grins at the banter being tossed about the briefing room, a long slender finger going up to rub at the scar running between his eyes.
"Gundarks, eh? That reminds me of a story I heard on... ce... " Kligur catches sight of the man's rather severe expression, the look causing the pilot to swallow hard.
"Perhaps another time, yeah. Down to business, right?"

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-01-12 20:26:19)

'Remind me to modify my sensor lights so I can roll them.' Red says, sounding exasperated. 'Will you people shut up so I can listen to the man say his piece?'

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **Rowen** (2008-01-14 20:32:07)

The man clears he throat and begins to speak. "I am Admiral Vissan. Commander of Delta quadrant on Tatooine." He pauses to glance at his papers. "As the communique stated, Captain Yu is missing. It was his mission to meet with Valsar Fisk, an arms and special weapons dealer on the Asteroid Epsilon Six. Or Pleasure Planet, if you like that kind of local flare." He smirks and pauses before continuing.
"Captain Yu's last transmission was from Pleasure Planet, informing us he had successfully met with Fisk and was leaving that same night to inspect the facilities." He starts to slowly pace behind the podium, his hands clasped behind his back. "He was never heard from again." Stopping behind the podium he turned to face the group again. "Captain Yu was in possession of well over one hundred thousand credits. All for the purchase and procurement of military grade weapons and armor for the Rebellion. We must find Yu, recover the credits and seal the deal for those weapons! Lives depend on it!" He slams his fist on the podium and you can tell he is very passionate in his belief.
Taking a deep breath and closing his eyes seems to calm him, he slowly opens them."We have a small window of opportunity before us. Our Rebel operative inside Tatooines starports has reported that in one hour they will be performing a update and reboot of the starship database. He has acquired the departure codes needed to leave low orbit when the computers are down." Again he looks over his papers. "If the computers come back online before you break orbit and jump to light speed you WILL be arrested, or destroyed. Your lives will be out of our hands at that time."
He begins to pace behind the podium once again. "Your contact once on Epsilon Six will be Jakar Nuu. A high stakes Sabacc dealer located in the Grand Nebular Casino. He's there every night. You can't miss him, a Zabrak with solid white horns, red eyes and a giant scar down the right side of his face." He moves from behind the podium and paces in front of the group, looking at each in turn. "You will play him." He makes a gesture with his hand and a card appears. He slowly rotates it with his fingers and everyone can see the Rebel insignia on the face of the card. "Insert this card in your hand and play it. He will know you wanting to do business. Tell him you want to by military grade weapons, place a few hundred credits on the table and you should get the location of Fisks facilities." He pauses in front of Jace. "All the while watch your backs, keep an eye out for Yu and find out what the HELL is going on!"
He returns back behind the podium. "Now, any questions?"

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-15 06:55:38)

Ganthos listens carefully while the Admiral speaks.
*So the rebels are starting to gather weapons and special gear, even out here…
Perhaps it is finally time to get really serious about this rebellion*
He turns inwards, seeking guidance in the Force, and then speaks up.
"I trust you have a ship ready for us, Admiral?"
(OOC: Take 10 on Use the Force to Search your Feelings. Trying to see if we will be able to leave in the simple and easy fashion the Admiral tells us, or if thereÂ´s something heÂ´s not telling us)

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-15 07:45:37)

Jace pauses to consider the Admiral`s words thinking to himself About time the good guys started fighting this war. Looking at the Admiral " My friend is right we will need a ship and some spending creds, otherwise I am sure we will complet this mission sucessfully."
Jace takes his feet off the table and stands, "I am ready to find master Yu, and aquire your munitions."

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **Anazider** (2008-01-15 10:38:43)

Kligur's jaw goes slack and his eyes wide and the mention of the one hundred-thousand credits. He shuts his mouth with a click, although he continues to lick his lips to keep himself from drooling.
"YES. Erm... er... Yes, we do need a ship. I'm currently between ships after the... M-Mushroom Mesa Incident." The Duro flinches as if warding off some blow that only he can see. Kligur quickly looks around afterwards, attempting to turn the flinch into a motion to adjust the fit of his jacket.
"And how reliable is this Valsar Fisk? For that matter, how about Jakar Nuu? These guys new contacts, or have you worked with them in the past?"

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **ganthet** (2008-01-15 14:38:06)

Mace stops and takes a mental inventroy of his supplys. "We will need some more med packs and any other supplys we might run out of while we are on our own." " Can you help us with that and I can check over the ship before we go." " Other then that we should have to much of a problem."

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **Rowen** (2008-01-16 08:26:58)

Admiral Vissan smiles at Jace. "Thats what I like to hear." He turns to Ganthos. "A ship is ready for you. Its a slightly modified YT-1300 and should be more than enough for the mission at hand." A slight inclination of his head has him staring at Kilgur. "Neither is trust worthy, but they are all we have. For your other questions, Yes.....we have worked with one of them in the past." Turning yet again he nods to Mace. "Supplies are loaded on the ship. Extra med packs, rations, everything you might need."
He reaches into one of his cargo pockets and pulls forth a small metal box, and hands it to Jace. "Captain Yu spoke highly of you so I entrust this to you. Inside you will find the card, One hundred thousand credits, and over one thousand in smaller credit chips for bribes and anything else you may need during the mission." He smiles slightly and looks over the group once more. "Epsilon Six resides very close to Dagobah in the Sluis Sector, the coordinates have been programed in the Nav computer on the ship. You wont have any problems with ship registration once you arrive, Pleasure Planet is filled with those wanted, in one fashion on another."
He moves back to the podium, "Any further questions before we get started?"

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-16 09:08:57)

Jace smiles and tucks the box away into his clothes, "I am ready to depart now, though" looking around the table to his friends "As soon as you are all ready we should begin this mission, that is if you agree to take on this task."
"Admiral I would like to get to the ship and prepare myself, what did you say the name was."

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-01-16 09:19:37)

'No questions Admiral.' Red states. 'And I won't ask for payment, since I owe master Yu my continued existence. After this mission if you wish to retain my services - and I assure you you do - you will have to pay for them like anybody else.'
He strides to the door and waits there while Vissan furnishes Jace with the ship's name. When Jace is satisfied he leaves with the Jedi.

### **Anazider** (2008-01-16 10:11:27)

"If it floats, flits, fleets, or flutters, I can fly it! Probably even land it too!" Kligur raps his knuckles twice on the table as he rises from his seat with a grin. He offers the admiral a half-salute before tucking his hands in his pockets and shuffling out the door, quite a bit more jovial than when he first came in.
"See you all on the boat."

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-16 10:58:32)

"Exactly what arms are these guys dealing in?" Ganthos asks as he rises from his seat.
"IÂ´ve always enjoyed that market myself" he says with a smile and then follows the others out the door. When theyÂ´ve come outside he speaks to the others in a lower tone.
"He seems trustworthy, donÂ´t you think? I didnÂ´t sense any deception from him anyway"

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **Rowen** (2008-01-17 09:00:21)

Those of you already outside see a dirty blond female in the same desert drab as Admiral Vissan run past. She bolts into the conference room and doesn't stop until she reaches Vissan. She salutes him sharply. "Sir..." she manages to get out through gasps. "The upgrade and reboot was started early." She inhales sharply. "The system will be back on line with in ten minutes."
Admiral Vissan's features darken noticeably. "What!" He screams. "I was assured my team would have ample time to prepare before leaving!" His fists clench.
The tech, seeing his anger steps back. "From what intelligence has managed to gather so far, it appears our plant was discovered." She pushes her bangs out from her eyes. "Were lucky we caught this at all........there is still time sir." She adds hopefully.
Admiral Vissan looks at her. "Always the optimist Vaella." He looks to Jace. "Lets get going. Ill show you to the ship. You will have to do an immediate prep and take off." He starts toward the doors in a full run with far more speed than you would have thought a man of his size was capable of.
Once out the door he yells over his shoulder. " Follow me, we've been found out! You need to leave NOW!"

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-17 10:31:02)

"So much for getting away nice and easy"
Ganthos wastes no time with the words, but sets of after the Admiral. As the ever-cautious fellow he is, he draws his pistol and scans around for targets.

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **ganthet** (2008-01-17 11:22:02)

Grabing his gear Mace follow the Adminal out the door. " I can help get the ship preped for take off." " What about the Imps, won't they be waiting for us once we break orbit." Mace thinks to himself *"What have I got myself into."*

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **Anazider** (2008-01-17 12:13:33)

"Cold starting a bucket then trying to run a blockade. Didn't think I'd be doing this again..." Kligur mumbles to himself as he ambles after the admiral and the others, shaking his head.
"Never a dull moment, eh gents? Shouldn't be looking at anything too rough; few interceptors here and there. Nothing I can't out-fly!" The Duro pilot grins confidently, while a small trickle of cold sweat begins to slide down his back.

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-17 12:39:22)

A noticeable smile appears on Jace`s face as he sets off after the admiral. Looking at the group "OK lets stay together, protect the admiral lets get to the ship." Jace runs to keep up with the rebel leader "So Kligur you can cold start this ship and run us out of the system good." More a statement then a question Jace continues his run. Quickly looking back to make sure the rest of the group is in hot pursuit, though not exactly looking to Red knowing full well that the droid can easily keep up. "Mace if we run into the enemy we know what to do, lets just hope we can get some speed into the bucket and maybe it has teeth too."  With that last statement Jace`s smile broadens.
*Just like the good old times.*

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-01-17 18:35:43)

'Just like old times!' Red suggests, unaware that he is mirroring Jace's thoughts. The lope of the droid's long legs easily keeps him abreast of the others, and being a mechanical he shows no sign of fatigue.
'I remember we did a lot of running back then, too.'

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **Rowen** (2008-01-18 07:14:58)

The run to the ship was short. As you arrive you can see it was well hidden, scores of rebel ground ops are just finishing the removal of the desert camouflage. The boarding ramp is already open, the lights inside illuminated. Admiral Vissan halts his run and faces the group, his physical strength shows as you notice he isn't even breathing hard. "This is where I say good bye." He give a slight smile. "Good luck on finding Captain Yu and be safe." With those parting words he salutes.
"We can keep any ground forces busy, you concentrate on jumping to lightspeed." With that he starts barking orders, allowing everyone to climb aboard and get in position for take off.

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-18 09:40:55)

Jace quickly examines the ship looking for weapon emplacements and the over all shape of the ship. With only a nod to the Captain Jace enters the ship "OK You heard the admiral lets get this tub moving," Jace heads for one of (if any) the Cannon stations.

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-18 10:28:24)

Ganthos quickly eyes the ship, but pays it no attention as he runs up the ramp after Jace. Leaving room in (possible) gunning stations for the true soldiers, he proceeds to try and find the ships internal systems, to check and see that they are all good to go.
(If no one objects, I can take the role of Engineer on the ship. I eyed through everyones sheets, and the other people with a good Mechanics skill can probably find another station where they can do more use)

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-01-18 13:40:36)

Red too goes for the second set of guns, offering Jace a professional nod from one warrior to another when they part ways to go to their individual stations.

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **Anazider** (2008-01-18 14:05:28)

Kligur stumbles up the boarding ramp towards the cockpit, flopping into a pilot chair in a sweating huff. Mopping sweat from his brow, the duro pilot goes through a well practiced start up routine, rapidly coaxing the freighter to life.
"I... hate... running. Its'why I fly..." He manages through ragged gasps for air.
"You fellas might wanna strap in. This one might be a little *rugged*."

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **ganthet** (2008-01-19 11:35:19)

Mace runs to the copit and sets down into the copilots seat and starts to go over the controlls try to help get the ship up and moving. " Cold start is not going to be good on the engines." "So is this usall operateing procidure for you guiys." Reaching for the seat belt Mace makes sure he is straped in.
(OCC I am better at fixing stuff then running it. I can help with repairs and such. I can also fix the living hope I won't get alot of practice.)

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-19 12:28:54)

Ganthos canÂ´t help but laugh at Maces comment.
"Yeah, weÂ´ve been in similar situations before...remind me to tell the story sometime"
With that, Ganthos makes sure he has a steady hold on something, and makes sure he has his tools at hand.

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **Rowen** (2008-01-19 16:04:44)

Jace and red both enter their battle stations, careful to strap in and bring there targeting computers online. Ganthos finds the engineering room and after a hurried inspection finds everything appears to be in order.
Kilgur hops in the pilots seat and starts flipping switches, mace stumbling into the seat beside him. With in seconds the engines roar to life. Kilgur closes the docking ramp while simultaneously lifting off and retracting the landing gear. If there had been no exterior view ports those aboard would not even known they had taken off.
With a small burst Kilgur managed to point the nose sky ward and is soon breaking orbit. The ships exit trajectory takes the group on the far side of the planet away from what looks like five Imperial Star Destroyers. However it appears a small squadron of Tie Fighters stumbled into you. Veering on an intercept course they grow closer.

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **Anazider** (2008-01-19 17:03:47)

Kligur begins to sweat in earnest with the appearance of the TIE fighters, but he keeps the flight path of the light freighter straight and true. He flips the internal comm to ship-wide.
"Looks like we got company! I need another two minutes before I can make the jump, think you can hold'm off that long?!" Making sure to not radically alter their hyperspace trajectory, Kligur begins a set of evasive maneuvers, the YT-1300 dancing at his command.

'Can a katarn climb?' Red scoffs, as two eyeballs appear in his sights. 'A pity this thing has such low-grade weapons, but we do the best we can. I propose we use some of our budget to make it autofire capable.'
He tracks the lead TIE of the pair with his laser cannon, then holds it steady and snaps off two shots, trusting on the highly predictable Imperial flight patterns to bring the second TIE under his blaster fire even as the first flies free. With any luck, an easy kill.
((OOC: 2 swift actions to aim, though I doubt it has cover, and a standard action to make a rapid shot. That's an attack roll at +7 (+7, -2 rapid shot, +2 for the ship's Int bonus) plus an additional +1 if it's in Point Blank Shot range, dealing 5d10x2 if it hits.))

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-20 07:38:32)

Jace smiles as the weapons systems check clears green good to go. Just as the other cannon begins to draw power and fire Jace takes aim at the lead tie as well then fires off a shoot whispering under his breath "May the force be with us." Quickly Jace prepares to fire again on the lead tie if it does not go down or the next in line. Shouting back to the others "Lets punch it we can do this everyone take a station, someone get on sensors and give Red and I a hand blasting these Ties out of the sky."
Again Jace smiles.

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-20 11:21:06)

Settling into place after the hasty takeoff, Ganthos speaks into the internal comm.
"Just like old times, eh. IÂ´m not the best mechanic around, so try to avoid getting shot before I can figure some of the systems out down here. How many are we facing by the way?"

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **ganthet** (2008-01-23 11:30:02)

From the copilots seat Mace busys himself checking things over and getting the shields up. "Everything is cool here." "Getting shields up , I hope the navacomputer isn't going to take too long." "This ship is pretty nice, and fixing a ship in space isn't alot of fun either."

Red fires his cannons first, hitting the closest Tie and neatly splitting it in two. The parts catch the Tie right behind it full in the front causing it to spin out of control.
The two Ties in Jace's view fire almost at the same time. Both laser's narrowly missing the ship. Jace take the opportunity to fire back, only glancing the lead Tie fighter.

Taking aim again at the Tie he had just hit Jace prepares to fire again. Shouting down the access hatch to the others "So far so good but Red and I will only be able to keep them off for so long, How is that jump coming?" Jace maneuvers to put the Tie in his sights and fires again.

An organic would probably whoop with joy. Red just counts over the comm: 'One down. Stand by for number two.'
Unable to use the same tactic on the second target, the droid computes potential angles of approach based on the information he has on TIEs and their strategies in his databanks, compared to the flight pattern of the attackers. He uses the probabilities worked out from this calculation to determine a likely approach for the second eyeball, and tracks along it, firing just ahead of where he expects the fighter to be in a concentrated burst.

As the ship twirls and twists to dodge the TIE fire, Ganthos does his best to familarize himself with the systems of the YT-1300. He tries to figure out what goes where, and how to quickest repair the ship should anything break.

"Keep at it guys, we're almost there!"
Kligur sends the freighter into another series of rolls and jukes, always correcting for the maneuvers to put the ship back on the right hyperspace trajectory. The durese pilot keeps a mental counter until the jump to lightspeed, hoping to buy enough time for the crew until then.

Jace and Red each obliterate a Tie each, sending the charred remnants into the void of space. One Tie remains and is on a direct heading for the cockpit. Kilgur see's the green light and punches the hyperdrive initiator. The stars appear to elongate, and lengthen, Hyperspace couldn't have come at a better time. Several saw the green laser burn a hole in empty space, where the YT had been.

Looking back to Red Jace just shakes his head and says "blasters are so uncivil, including star ship blasters." With a smile Jace exits the gunner seat "That was good team work!" Jace leaves the gunner station and head for the ships common room to meditate.

Ganthos emerges from the mechanics station into the common room, a smile on his face.
"Well that wasnÂ´t so bad now was it? Great shooting there guys, and some marvelling flying from you Kligur"
He settles down in one of the seats, producing a small golden coin from the pocket of his clothing. He starts to roll the thing on his knuckles, focusing on the Force to roll it around his entire hand rather than changing direction when reaching the last knuckle.
"How long before we hit Epsilon Six?"

Kligur locks in the hyperspace coordinates and activates the autopilot, the durable light freighter flitting through a sea of light towards their destination.
"Gonna take us about three or four days to get there, so we've got some time. Nice shooting fell- erm..." He squints at Red as he scratches at the scar running between his eyes. "Do you count as a fella? There's a question... But yeah, its gonna be a while. Best make whatever preparations you need to along the way."

The five day hyperspace trip proved uneventful and everyone feels relieved as the trails of stars once again turn to points of light. The ship gives a slight shudder as the YT-1300's sublight engines take over.
The site from the forward view port is nothing short of amazing. Lanes of ships of all makes, models, and sizes are orbiting a asteroid that is embedded in a faint patch of nebula. The side facing the ship is a mass of hangar bays, each capable of holding several medium sized ships each.
The comm comes alive with chatter and a human sounding voice speaking basic address you, "Stand by for tractor beam docking. Please maintain your present course." After several minutes the voice returns. "Tractor beam lock is complete. Please shut down your engines and extend your landing gear." Kligur acknowledges and flips a few switches and cutting off the engines. The only sound are the servos as the landing gear moves into position.
The complexity of the docking system becomes apparent as you near the hangar. Several times the ship was stopped to allow ships to pass on there way to docking areas. Each heading in a different direction in relation to your ship. Soon you are within the hangar and gently set down. The voice once again crackles over the comm. "Welcome to Planet Paradise, we hope you enjoy your stay......a docking attendant will assist you when you exit the craft."

Jace smiles at Red`s inquiry not in the least surprised by it. "Cover stories are a good idea, maybe we should pass our selves off as laborers." Jace smirks at his own remark "That would make Red a labor driod. Lets secure the ship before we depart it will serve as our way off if anything should happen, also if we get split up we should meet back here." Jace gathers his belongings being careful to hide his lightsaber well.

Kligur goes through the lockdown process for the ship's controls, making sure no one but him can take off in the transport.
"Probably there to greet us with warm face towels, and mint candies. Give us directions, and whatnot. These ritzy places got people like that."
He speaks to the others as they scurry about the ship behind the cockpit, getting to depart the boat. When Red speaks, the Duros pilot mockingly pantomimes the droids words, low so as Red can't hear him.
"Uppity bread-maker... probably doesn't know an interface jack from a hole in the wall." Kligur mutters to himself, continuing to manipulate the freighters controls until the lockdown is complete.

'Yes, they are very good.' Red comments.

'First let me tell you that though I am *not* a bread maker, if I *were* I would be the best bread maker the Galaxy has ever seen, capable of making all types of bread in all shapes, sizes, flavours, and grades. I could even pre-toast it.'
'Second, I *can* tell an interface jack from a hole in the wall. An interface jack is whichever orifice on your disgusting, squishy, mephitic person I choose to stick my foot in. Or whichever orifice I choose to *make* on your disgusting, squishy, mephitc person.'

Kligur attempts to work moisture back into a mouth that has rather suddenly gone dry.
"I, uh... have all the holes I need. Thanks. Well, lets get to it, shall we?"
Redoubling his efforts, Kligur quickly flips a last few switches and hops out of the pilot seat, edging past Red and giving the droid as wide a berth as possible. He keys in a code to the boarding ramp, causing it to lower and expose the crew to the hangar bay.

The boarding ramp opens and reveals a large hangar with two other ships, all of which appear to be the YT class of transport ship. Standing by the boarding ramp is a human male with a clip board and a pasted on smile. He inclines his head slightly and says with practiced enthusiasm. "Welcome to Pleasure Planet!" He bows and adds. "Where all your wildest dreams may come true."
As he straightens up a rugged, overweight human male approaches him. His work clothes are covered with lubricating oil and grime. He whispers in the attendants ear and takes his clip board and heads up the ramp, stopping just before the group. "Ill get straight to the point." He says in a gruff baritone voice. "Your ships transponder code matches that of a YT-1300 that broke through a barricade above Tattoine." He flips threw the papers attached to the clipboard.
"Several conditions must be met if you are to stay at Pleasure Planet. First, our technicians need to mask your transponder code. Second, due to the nature of your arrival.....namely arriving on *the run* your docking fee's will be greatly increased." He looks up. "After all we should be compensated for harboring known fugitives, wouldn't you agree?"
"Standard transponder masking will run 2000 credits. Docking fee will be 50 credits per day." He offers a slight smile and tosses the clipboard back to the attendant. "We also offer refueling at a rate of 75 credits per ones days worth of fuel."

'We will disguise the transponder codes.' Red says. He raises a hand as he does so to forestall any complaint the man would otherwise offer. 'Afterward, your technicians may check our work and we pay for their time. More convenient for you and your employees, more affordable for us... or more profitable for you should they find our job lacking and have to redo the job. There are benefits no matter how you look at it.'

The man grins at Red. "Disguise them?" He asks. "By all means. However where would you get the emulated transponder code from?" He grunts and scratches his cheek. "You need to have another ships transponder code to.....ummm, borrow its identity." He sighs. "We have *alternate* transponders in stock. Cost is about the same.....you can install the hardware but to borrow our signal will cost you 1000 credits, and we check your work." He places his hands behind his head stretches.

Scanning the man with scepicism in his eyes, Ganthos offers the man a smile.
"Look, if you are really that concerned that we are known fugitives, it would be in your interest to have our transponder codes fixed as soon as possible, right? Well, **we** can just take off if someone comes looking for us, but **you** will have to try and explain what we were doing here. Thus IÂ´d say that our suggestion isnÂ´t completely unreasonable, and would be in the best interests of us both"

Jace casually walks down the transport ramp and falls in behind his friends. Folding his arms in front of himself Jace focuses on the overweight human reaching out with the force to search the mans feelings.
"1000 credits seems fair, but only if its a permanent transponder exchange. As you know ships are plentiful and transponder code just as plenty. Besides ships blast off of Tattoine daily these days let alone a number of other planets. Is it our fault we bought a ship from the wrong person?" Jace steps out in front at his last statement and shrugs his shoulders at the overweight human. "We are only laborers looking for work it would take some time to gain the credits you require, that is of course we can find an agreement."

The man scratches his head. "Course the transponder disguise is permanent." He sighs again. "Time you have, unless you want to leave before paying." He grins at Jace. "The ship will be locked down until payment is received, you may leave someone to supervise if you wish of course." His grin fades. "Nothing will happen to your ship, after all I have a business to run and word would get out if I sabotaged every customer that came my way."
The man at the foot of the ramp steps forward and hesitates, looking at the larger man before again looking at the group and addressing them. "If you are ready I am able to give you instructions to establishments and answer basic questions about Pleasure Planet."
The big man looks over his shoulder at the attendant. "If there are no further questions Ill go get my tools and start the installation."

Jace, Mace and Kilgur take the door opposite the ship, it opens to a narrow passageway that runs approximately one-hundred feet before opening to the heart of Pleasure Planet. As you exit the passageway your ears are assaulted with the sounds of gamblers, betting machines, and the drone of holovid advertisements that hang along the ceiling.
The inside of Pleasure Planet is octagon in shape with all shops accessible from the outside promenade. In the center is a smaller octagon which appears to house the local security force, as well as the banks and credit machines.
The floor from the center to the main Promenade is mostly heavy grade Duraplex which allows security to view a floor above and below with ease.
The floor you are on seems quite busy. The promenade is packed with those wishing to try there luck in the casino's or drown there sorrows in the cantina's.
___________________________________________________________
After their companions disappear from view Ganthos and Red turn in enough time to see the overweight human walk into the service corridor. The attendant bows to the both of them before exiting the hangar threw the same door Jace's group took, apparently feeling there was no need for his lingering about. With everyone gone the hangar is eerily quiet, the outer shields keeping much of the traffics noise to a minimum. As you look around you hear a loud crash in the direction the overweight worker went, followed by the unmistakable sound of tools dropping to the floor.

Jace steps into the promenade pulling his cloak around himself but not from any chill. Looking from left to right Jace decides to take the right side. "I believe we will find what we are looking for this way guys." With a kind smile to his friends Jace nods to the right before starting in that direction at a leisurely pace.

Walking though the crowd of people betting on everything one could think of. "As long as your luck holds out, you would never need to leave this place."

'I think that man may be in trouble. Or dead. Or a killer. Maybe all three.' Red comments as matter-of-factly as droids do in situations like these. Unless they're effeminate wierdos like those golden-plated protocol droids who've been left too long without a restraining bolt, of course.
He strides off around the side of the ship to burst in on the crime in progress, or the crime scene, whichever it happens to be when he arrives. He's not too fussed really, his lack of humanity (or anything-anity) affording him the enviable ability to take a laid back approach to the whole affair.

As the small group negotiates its way through the twists and turns of the promenade, Kligur gets increasingly twitchy with each sabacc table and quarter-cred slot machine.
"Just, uh... Just one hand wouldn't hurt, ya know? Might win us some new money for the ship, ya know? Ha ha... Lookout!" The durese pilot ducks as one of the slot machines pays off, its winning siren soundling somewhat similar to the warning buzzer in a cockpit just before crash.

Jace continues his walk around the promenade with Mace close behind marveling at all the machines and advertisements while Kligur flits from betting machine to betting machine. While his winnings were small he catches back up to the group Fifty credits richer and a broad smile on his face.
The walk itâ€™s self was uneventful and soon they find themselves before the Grand Nebular Casino. Being one of the larger Casinoâ€™s on Pleasure Planet it has the largest, most elaborate sign. Reminiscent of an old Childs story it boasts a glowing, almost neon like sign with fancy calligraphic lettering.
Unlike the other shop fronts they passed by this one has several security guards positioned at the door and a droid detection device in the middle of the double entrance. Thick burgundy curtains block your view inside.
((Anazider you get 50 credits))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Red strides around the ship heading for the service entrance where the commotion happened. An armored man jumps out from around the corner, throws a small round object directly at him and disappears around the corner once again. The small object hits the floor at Reds feet, causing a concussion that erupts from its epicenter that travels thru his body. The powerful electrostatic burst causes damage to the circuitry throughout.
"I'm taking you in Blue, dead or alive."
((Simply the Ion grenade causes 8 damage. A PM as also sent to you))
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ganthos walks back inside the ship, easily finding the engine room he begins to study its layout and current configuration. While browsing different lights and vid screens start to flicker and eventually wink out completely, even the emergency lights fail to come on, leaving him in complete darkness.

"Wow that is something. I have seen stardrive use less power then that sign." Mace looks down at the guards. "So how we goignt to get past them?" " Good thing we left Red back at the ship he would probably shoot them or try to bully his way in some how."

Jace steps into the Grand Nebular Casino slowly. Scanning the floor Jace takes a moment then looks back to the others and says quietly "We should play a game or two while I look around for our contact. Stay close together and watch each others back." Jace slowly walks the floor making it look as though he is interested in the games but continues to scan for his contact.
As Jace walks the floor Jace reaches out with the force trying to sense the beings around him. Looking for their moods and his contact.

My creator stares, glassy-eyed, his breathing growing duller, the noise of him trying to pull those breaths coming as a rattle. The woostoid slumps on the floor by his desk, broken, bloodied.
'Red...' His voice comes as a whisper.
'Master.' I am there. *Why am I there?*
His gaze falls on me and he panics briefly. Then he calms for some reason. Perhaps he realises he cannot afford to expend energy so pointlessly.
*Why?*
I repeat the thought aloud:
'Why?'
'Blue...' He says, trying to make some gesture with his hands. It has no meaning.
'He is not here, master. He is patrolling the halls.'
His eyes grow wide as he tries to convey something to me without success. He gives up, and his head falls to his chest.
'Who did this, master?'
'You did.' A new voice. My brother, Xa-16. "Blue".

'Dead.' Red says dully. 'I did that, did I?'
'Alive,' he continues, 'I never wanted him dead.'
*Dead or alive. The bounty hunter. Sort this out later.*
Red's right arm reconfigures slightly, to reveal the barrel of a blaster.
'Dead or alive? Then why are you attacking me? As a droid you can take me in neither state. You should also know I'm not Blue.'
'But,' he adds, almost as an afterthought, 'if you continue to harass me, *I will kill you for your mistake.*. You might find it preferable to tell me what my brother has done to deserve a bounty.'

"Drink? Drink?! I've got no time for booze, my hand is hot!" Kligur waves the one fifty credt chip he has earned as proof of his good fortune, before following Jace in.
"Gotta hit the tables while I'm on a roll! They'll be naming this place the "Grand Kligur" Casino after I'm done with it!"
The Durese pilot takes a deep breath once they're inside of the casino, as if he were trying to smell where the tables were the loosest. He stretches his fingers, the expert maneuver ruined by a popping of one of the knuckles and a grimace marring Kligur's wide grin.
"Let me know if you need me. I'll be the one with the crowd of adoring fans all around."

"Ok my friend. Just don't ask me for a loan I ain't got a whole lot." Mace walks to the bar and asks for Corellian Ale. Finding a table somewhere he can watch the action of the Sebac tables. *"Man I wonder how hard it will be to find what we are looking for here?" [i/] He thinks to himself. He will try to keep Kilgur in site as best he can but in this mess that might be impossiable.*

Upon entering the casino Mace makes a break for the bar, leaning against the counter and casually keeping an eye on Kligur who seems to have a keen eye on the Sabacc tables. Meanwhile Jace closes his eyes and searches the feelings of those around. Tension and fear surround most of the gamblers while the dealers seem clam, and confident.
Only a few seconds seem to pass and Jace has the general location of their contact and starts moving in that direction. In the very back, at one of the corner tables sits the Zabrak, his white horns glinting in the low light and his giant scar highly visible even from this distance.
The area is clear of players at the moment. It seems he just came on shift; heâ€™s still arranging the table and opening a new deck of cards.
_______________________________________________________________________________
â€œWhat has your *brother* done?â€ The armored man asks. â€œOh thatâ€™s rich Blue. You think a simple color change is going to fool me?â€ He steps into view, his carbine firmly braced against his shoulder and aimed directly at Red. â€œKilled hundreds, cheated thousands, is that enough of a reason?â€ He pauses and shifts his body sideways to provide less of a target for Red. â€œNothing more than a low rent IG-88â€¦â€¦â€¦â€
His words are cut off as Red raises his arm and fires so quickly that anyone watching would swear it was one move. The bolt arcs off the bounty hunters left shoulder, causing him to step back. â€œYour PATHETIC Droid!â€ He screams and returns fire. The blaster blot manages to land directly in Reds midsection, smoke billows up as soon as it penetrates the droid.
((Damage was 23 HP Simply, -1 on the condition track now.))
_______________________________________________________________________________
Ganthos feels his way around the ship.
The sounds of talking, no make that screaming can be heardâ€¦â€¦
The light to the exit ramp comes into view. A few quick strides and his out! Once down the ramp a scene of unexpected proportions unfolds. Red, standing only a few yards away is staring down an armor clad human. Smoke is drifting from his midsection and the air smells heavily of machine oil. The man has a carbine pointed at Red, his left shoulder a fresh carbon score.

'Foolish organic.' Red says calmly even as smoke billows from his midsection (apparently nothing truly vital was hit). 'It's dangerous to insult a droid, when it has nothing to lose. You, on the other hand, gamble your so-called life on it!'
He fires again, arm outstretched, two rapid stun shots at the bounty hunter's chest.
((OOC: Okay, so I forgot to mention I have point blank shot last time. My bad, at least I still hit. Heh. So this time, it's +1 point blank, -1 condition, -2 to use rapid shot and go for an additional die of damage. Final modifier of +5. Oh, and two swift actions towards recovering that condition.))

*What has he gotten himself into this time?*
While observing the scene, Ganthos unholsters his pistol. Even as smoke is flowing from Reds body, he isnÂ´t really worried. The droid is quite sturdy. As Reds pistol opens fire again, he takes a few quick steps down the lowered ramp, crouches and fires a stun shot.
(Attack is at +7 if IÂ´m within Point Blank Range, otherwise +6. 3d8+3 damage.

JAce stands and watches his friends play the games for a moment. "I think I have found a game to my liking, keep an eye on each other." Jace walks over the Zabraks table and takes a seat.
"Ah the place look good, business looks good. Whats your game?" Jace continues to reach out trying to see if this Zabraks has any reaction to him sitting down. Jace sides a few credits on the table 10 to start "Maybe I could try and double this."

Kligur inhales deeply through the slits of his nostrils, as if scenting the air. Shortly after, he shoulders his way through the press of people, arriving at the 'hottest' table in the Casino.
"Yes... This is where the legend will be born! No cr-cr-crashing for me tonight!" The pilot blinks one eye and flinches in a nervous tic, appearing completely oblivious of the action.
"Whats the buy in?!"

Kligur arrives at his table. The dealer glances him over and smirks. â€œHigh stakes, 10 credits to open.â€ He shuffles the deck. â€œYou game?â€
Mace continues to watch Kligur as he *works his magic.*
Jace sits down and Jakar frowns but grins slightly at the site of a credit chip. â€œFive credits in the main pot, Five in the Sabacc potâ€¦â€¦itâ€™s a good start.â€ He deals two cards, face down to each of them. After dealing he looks at his own cards. â€œMy total is 5â€¦â€¦..and yours?â€
((Jace PM sent with your cards ))
_______________________________________________________________________________________
Ganthos quickly moves down the ramp, kneels and fires; hitting the bounty hunter square in the chest.
Red fires two quick shots that miss, hitting the bulkhead behind his target in a shower of sparks.
The bounty hunter strafes to the left, firing his carbine on the move, the bolt narrowly missing Red. â€œI wonâ€™t miss next time!â€ He yells.

"Have you worked here long?" Jace asks still trying to gauge the man while keeping an eye out for anyone paying attention to his table.

Kligur counts out ten of his hard-earned credits, sliding them across the table to the dealer in a very sly, or so he thinks, fashion. His fingers spasm in anticipation of the cards being dealt, the Duros snapping them up and sorting them as they come across the table.
Reaching under his vest, Kligur produces a large red button hanging from a chain. Those hovering around or just behind his seat may spy the letters "EJE" on the button, the rest timeworn and fire-scorched away. He kisses the button for luck, tucking it back beneath his vest as the first hand begins.

Suddenly his comlink starts to beep, and he reaches for it and hears MaceÂ´s voice speaking to him.
"Oh, we are having a small shootout with some two-bit bounty hunter. How are you doing?"

Jakar places 5 credits in the pot as well and deals a card out to Jace. â€œLong enough to know youâ€™ve never played this game before.â€ He grins, and also draws a card.
Mace stands in a panic over the information he received from Ganthos. With both Jace and Kligur heavily involved in their games they donâ€™t seem to catch his shock.
Kligur takes the cards and scans them. An Ace and the Idiot, so 15 points total. The dealer anteâ€™s up and looks at his cards with a wide grin. â€œNot often this happens kid.â€ He holds his cards out for Kligur to see. He holds the Master card and a Nine of Flasks. â€œPure Sabaccâ€¦â€¦.game over!â€ He chuckles and scoops up the credit Kligur so willing gave up.
((Tru you have a PM))

Jace pauses a moment to consider his cards, inwardly he focuses on Mace searching his feelings and trying to establish contact with him through his mind. Looking up to Jakar Jace places a red card in his hand, hiding it but making sure the dealer sees it. "Lets say we up the ante two hundred credits." Jaces voice is low, and Jace casually places the two hundred credits on the table. "Perhaps after the game we could talk business?"
As Jace reaches out to Maces mind his thoughts are on finding out what has upset his friend. ("Calm my friend, think of what has upset you and we will get through it together. Let me listen to your thoughts.")

Kligur grumbles mightily as the dealer scoops up his credits. He fiddles through his vest, fishing out his good luck charm and kissing it once more, before slamming twenty credits on the table.
"Double it up! That was just a warm-up hand... Yeah, warm-up hand..."

Mace starts making his way toward Kligur since he is the closest. All the while projecting his thoughts to Jace about the situation in the hangar.
The dealer smiles at Kligur and anteâ€™s his 20 credits, a sly smile forming on his lips. He deals and reveals his card totals. â€œI have 6.â€ He states, looking at Kligur. â€œWhat do you have.â€

Ganthos uses his mind trick causing the bounty hunter to flinch and guard as if something were falling on him and starts to line up his shot.

All security personnel please investigate and apprehend the offenders.

Jakar frowns, â€œI hope those arenâ€™t your friends they speak of.â€ He starts repacking his cards. â€œI might be able to helpâ€¦..but we must hurry.â€ He adds in a whisper.
The dealer in front of Kligur moans and tosses the twenty credits back to him. â€œItâ€™s your lucky day.â€ And begins to pack his card back into their sleeve.

Its how the workers get from floor to floor with out fighting the crowded promenade." He clears his throat. "Your friends just need to enter the service corridor in that hangar. Tell them to exit on floor 28, entry code for the door is 1178." He turns and starts to head for the back exit and calls over his shoulder. "Be quick about it."

'Yes, the arrival of unwanted and unpleasant persons unknown hasn't exactly escaped my notice,' Red responds dryly, moving with long strides away from the side of the hatch and down the ramp. 'The alarms were my first clue and turned out to be a big one, but I wouldn't be so humble as to deny the genius of my deductive skills. It was quite a leap of reasoning.'
'Close the hatch before we leave,' he suggests once at the bottom of the ramp. 'Escaping won't do us much good if we get our transport out of this pooda-hole stolen or looted for components.'

Ganthos quickly closes the hatch once Red is away, then he starts to move towards the service corridor.
"You know, weÂ´ve go to do something about your programming. Perhaps disable your vocabulator for a while"

As Mace follows his freinds. He hopes that Ganthos and Red are ok and not in need of his services. "So if our friends are involed in this what will happen to them?" Mace knows that they would not cause aporblem without good reason, but things have away of going wrong when you least expect them to. "Is security be easy to deal with in this place?" Mace asks Jace.

Jace, Kligur and Mace follow Jakar to the service elevator in the back of the casino. He keys in his pass code and waits only a short time before the doors open. He steps inside and waits for everyone to enter before pressing the button to there destination.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Ganthos and Red walk in tandem to the service corridor. Its in a standard "L" shape layout, with stairs on the right side and the elevator on the left. Ganthos walks up the the keypad and enters the code Jace gave him using the force. Once entered gears can be heard grinding as the lift begins to move. Voices can now be heard in the hanger.

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-05-24 04:49:45)

As Ganthos quickly enters the code, he can hear the elevator moving. It seems not to be a modern turbolift though, and he can hear the gears shifting. He takes a few quick steps into the stairway opposite the elevator while waiting for the elevator to come, keeping his eyes focused in the direction of the hangar.

### **simplyscribed** (2008-05-24 13:38:45)

Red follows Ganthos into the stairwell.
'Why not just take the stairs?' He queries, head tilting slightly to the left. 'They could lock down the lift too.'

### **master_Tru** (2008-05-24 20:06:02)

Jace stands inside the lift awaiting their destination and folds his arms in front of himself. Looking over to Jakar, Jace asks "Where could we meet up with my .... friends? They are very important to our transaction."

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-05-25 05:27:42)

"Jace told me to get to the elevator. IÂ´m sure he had some reason to do so. And I would hate to have to scale the stairs of we need to travel 50 floors"
He throws a quick glance towards the hangar again.
"But if you think we should split up, then be my guest"

### **ganthet** (2008-05-31 14:06:28)

Mace checks over his Med kit to make sure everything is ready incase there is need for them. Then he checks the charge on his blaster. Mace is never one to go into a situation without making sure he is ready. "Jace is do you know if our friends are injuryed? If one of them are I am going to need someplace to tend to them." Mace is hopeing that his services will not be need but with this group from what he has seen so far he might have his work cut out for him.

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **Rowen** (2008-05-31 15:37:18)

The lift slowly ascends as Jace, Mace and Kligur await there destination. Jakar cocks a head toward Jace, "Your friends in the hangar should arrive at the elevator across from this one if all goes right." After only a short wait the elevator jerks to a stop and the doors open.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Ganthos and Red enter the elevator as soon as it arrives. Both moving inside and quickly hitting the appropriate floors button. The doors seem to hang up as the marching of feet gets closer. "I think I hear something in the service corridor." You hear one say. Just as they enter the corridor the doors close and the elevator starts moving.

"Horray for modern technology, huh"
The smile on GanthosÂ´s face donÂ´t seem sincere as he pulls out his comlink.
"Mace? where are your guys? This cutting egde elevator had some trouble at the start, and IÂ´m pretty sure they know weÂ´re in here"

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **ganthet** (2008-05-31 18:16:04)

Mace hears his commlink beep. He pulls it out and see that it is Ganthos. "We are in a a service corridor waiting for you." "Are you guys allright?" Mace was glad to hear his friends voice and hopes that they don't bring an intire security force with them. "We need to get out of here when they arrive. Is there any place we can go untill thing blow over?"

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **master_Tru** (2008-06-01 06:43:03)

Jace smiles at the confirmation that his friends are ok. "Hey Ganthos good to hear your voice, are guys ok? Any injured?" Jace looks around the lift to his friends then back to Mace "Mace is right staying low might give us the chance to ready ourselves."

Jakar grins while listening to the companions. "Everything will be fine. Once your friends join us we will goto my apartment and from there discuss business." He scans the group in front of him. "They will not think to search my room. We have a......deal you could say."

---

## Re: Chapter Three "Dead Reckoning"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-06-01 16:15:04)

"Yeah, weÂ´re fine. Problem is, thereÂ´s a pretty good chance that the security is headed your way. So once we get up, IÂ´d suggest you have someplace for us to go"

Red leans forward slightly to bring himself close to Ganthos' comlink, and his waist joint make a momentary squealing complaint.
'Hm, I must be due an oil bath.' The droid comments. Then his original thought reasserts itself at the head of his process queue.
'What Ganthos means is that we would hate to cripple this place's security force over a misunderstanding, so for their sakes we should be kept apart until things blow over.'

### **ganthet** (2008-06-03 01:14:28)

"Sorry Red, we should stick together until thing cool down. We have a place to lay low and we have bussiness to conduct." Mace looks at Jace for back up on this. "Besides you two will atrack more attention if you are running around try to find a place to hide." Mace is alittle consered but he know they are capable. "Strenght in numbers and all that."

Jace gives a slight bow to Jakar and smiles "My thanks to you for your aid." Turning to Mace Jace gives him a nod and speaks into com "You do not sound so hot Red are you in need of repairs? Lets get together and at least plan our next move, we will need more information before we proceed."

### **Rowen** (2008-06-10 22:26:56)

The elevator arrives with a screech and the doors slowly open, even someone with no mechanical experience would know that this elevator had seen better days. Ganthos and Red gladly step out of the dilapidated contraption and reunite with the rest of the group. Jakar smiles, "Glad you made it. Now, lets be quick. I'm sure they will be here soon and I don't need to answer any unnecessary questions." He turns and motions for everyone to follow. "The more questions they ask the more our little arrangement costs, if you know what I mean." He adds over his shoulder.
This floor is much different from the promenade, instead of a wide open space in the center there is just a wall where the transparent floor would begin. In essence its a completely circular hallway with doors on each side. Jakar stops at room 1178 and slides his ID badge in the card reader. The doors light turns from red to green, a heavy clunk from within the door can only be the sound of the lock disengaging.
Jakar opens the door and lets everyone inside, following behind and locking the door. "Please have a seat and rest." He sets his gambling set by the door and strides to one of the many couches, plopping down and stretching out. "There are plenty of seats for everyone." He adds while motioning to the other two couches that form a "U" shape with the one he is currently sitting on. "I assume you are ready to discuss what brought you to this *facility* in the first place?" His sarcasm is not missed in his stressing of the word facility. "However, saving you from a complication and possibly getting arrested does add a substantial amount to your bargaining tab. Wouldn't you agree?" With that he leans forward, waiting for a reply.

Mace looks at mess Red is and takes out his tools and sucurity kit to help his friend out with the repairs. "Let me give you a hand with that my freind." Mace says. Looking over at Ganthos. "I am going to assume that you are ok?" Before Ganthos can answer he turns his attention back to Red.

Smiling Jace nods to the rest of his friends when they meet up again "Glad your both ok." Continuing on behind Jakar, Jace follows the man into his quarters and takes a seat. Jace leans over and whispers to Mace "I would ask before you get to close to his components, Red might not accept your aid."
Looking around the room and back to Jakar Jace smiles and continues "We would like to acquire a list of .... iteams and more importantly information on the whereabouts of an individual. Our sources have informed us that you where the man to get that done and without ..... outside interference." Jace meets Jakar gaze and begins to search outward through the force. "Does this sound like something you could do? The rewards for doing business with us are more then fair."

"So, what did we miss?"

'A good thing too. Organics are so much messier when they get damaged and need repair,' Red comments, 'I'm sure our host would object to you staining the couch.'
The droid stands to one side and allows Mace to take a look at his internals, pointing out exactly where the problems are.
'And don't bother trying to find my kill switch,' he adds, 'because I wasn't built with one.'

"That could work pretty effective as a kill switch." Mace continues to work on Reds systems. "Personaly I have met driods with worse personallitys then Red here. Of course I wiped them after awhile, but I think our friend here would put up to much of a fight for us to do that." Mace says with a smile. "Ok, lets see what we can do hear."

'You organics would have less wars and far less religious and political genocides if you could only allow those around you the right to think for themselves,' Red comments soberly.
'And why should I not put up a fight?' He queries, head tilting towards Mace. 'Would you not fight and kill if someone threatened to remove *your* memories and knowledge? An organic-made existence is not an existence all the same to you?'

"Yes I agree. I imagine life would get alittle boreing with Red around." Mace continues working on Red's systems with his assitance of course. Reaching for another tool. "I guess I never really looked at it fromthe driods pointof view before. I was just doing my job and that was part of it. Afte meeting you I guess I will look at it differently from now on."

Jakar smiles at Jace, oblivious of the banter around. His mind was focused on business. "I am a person of many skills and one of them doesn't include beating around the proverbial bush. If you have something, and/or in this case *someone* you need information on tell me. I need specifics in order to aid you, and the price varies depending on the information." He leans forward. "The Rebellion sent you that much is obvious from the card you showed me. So you can't be all that bad, any one that hates the Empire as much as me is alright in my book. But at the same time this is a business, thats why they gave you a little.....bargaining money. So lets cut to the chase, who are you looking to find and what are you wishing to procure?"

Jace returns Jakars smile "To the point I like that. With our obvious employer the main reason for our visit is officially weapons. I was pointed in your direction with the hopes that you could arrange such a transfer and credits should not be an issue." Jace looks down deep in thought for a moment then back to jakar. "On a personal note I am looking for an operative who was sent before us on the very same mission to contact you, he may have gone by the name of Hideki. It would be a great personal favor to me if you could disclose any information on this individual."

Jakar leans forward, truly interested in the deal and conversation. He absently rubs his chin. "Its been weeks since anyone has contacted me from the Rebellion. I believe he was the guy you speak of, but he left to meet Mr Fisk shortly after arranging the contact with me." He stands and starts to pace. "I haven't heard from Mr Fisk since that day as well. I assumed the deal must have gone as planned. But it must not if you are asking about him."

Mace continues to work on Red and listening to Jace and Jakar's conversation, as much of it as he can anyway. Switching tools and checking systems to make they where fucntioning properly. Without knowing what the plans and specs for Red he was going by what he knew of driods and what the parts where supposed to do.

### **Rowen** (2008-07-11 15:10:24)

"Contact?" He shakes his head. "I'm afraid even I havn't been able to get in contact with him, things went silent just after your friend went to go visit him." He rubs his chin again. "I do know where his factory is located, I could upload the information to your Nav computer and it will lead you right to teh factory."
He stands and stretches, "Could have some clues to the information you are seeking at any rate." He casually walks over to the small bar and takes a glass and bottle from behind it. "About your payment....." He slowly pours a little of the drink into his glass and swirls it around, sniffing its aroma. "Just give me 100 credits to cover the security teams bribe, I can't take your money just as I couldn't take his..........I knew Master Yu well." With that being said he drinks down his drink, his back still turned toward the group.

Jace motions for Mace to come over "Mace will take the nav co-ordinates." Looking over to Red and smiling at how fast the droid was brought back to full efficiency.

Jakar led the group from his room to the main floor. The crowds had settled and the drone of gambling machines could still be heard above the rustle of the few patrons hard at work testing their luck. The walk continued unimpeded as they descended down to the lower levels of the complex.
The ship was just as the group had left it. During its start up routine Jace loaded the nav coordinates into the computer. With in seconds their destination appeared on the forward view port, by the computers calculations the trip would only be half a days travel by hyperspace.
The takeoff was smooth, traffic at this point was slim and the traffic advisory cleared them for departure almost immediately. Once a safe distance away from the station they entered hyperspace, heading for Valsar Fisks factory.
The half day of travel allowed the group to rest and when the ship exited hyperspace they were ready for what lay ahead. Before them was an asteroid, much like that of â€˜Pleasure Planetâ€™ but on a much smaller scale. Girders and scaffolding were attached to the surface of the asteroid creating a rectangular landing path to the factory itself.
As the ship carefully navigates the Durasteel landing strip you can tell it has gone into a state of disrepair. Landing lights that once directed ships were either broken or turned on their axis, pointing off into the void. In the distance you can make out electrical discharges emanating from some of the shield generators. The hangar was in similar disrepair with what appear to be carbon score marks on the walls. The entrance door appears to have been blown from the inside but its to dark beyond to see inside.
The ships lands safely and the instruments show a oxygen rich environment.

Mace ambles behind the group and remains unusually quiet. The carbon scoring on the walls seems to have come from a blast with in the compound, with the scoring thicker at the door as it feathers out up to 20 feet. The doors themselves are bulging giving the impression the door has been hit by a large boulder. From your vantage point is appears the doors are still intact.
