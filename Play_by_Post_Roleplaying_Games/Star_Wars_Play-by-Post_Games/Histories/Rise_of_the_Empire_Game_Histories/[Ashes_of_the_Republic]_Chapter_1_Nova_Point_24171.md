# [Ashes of the Republic] Chapter 1: Nova Point

### **Tempeste** (2009-05-31 14:23:16)

Far from the eyes of the Empire lies Nova Point, a space station in deep space away from any Imperial Patrol route. Its burnished exterior surface is covered in small holes, hangar bays and exhaust holes, and the walls slope outwards as they meet the Asteroids surface. The station once harvested the the surrounding field before the fuel supplies ran dry, the owners left and Mughral moved in, setting uo a safe place for the Galaxy's many smugglers as the empire clamped down on criminal activity.
Over the past few days rumours have been abound that Mughral has been looking for good men. These were confirmed today as the Station Master sent out a general request for any willing Men and Women to meet at the observation deck, the peak of Nove Point.
Be it by choice or necessity you have found your way to Nova Point and this request is almost too intriguing to turn down. Be you in the Docking Bay, Cantina or warehouse you hear the message.

Hearing the news of work being available, Trav puts down his drink and the Twi'lek from his lap. When she moans in complaint,
"Sorry, hon, but work's work, and I gotta earn me them credits." Grabbing her chin in his hand, Trav plants a heavy kiss on her lips before pulling away and slipping credits in the lithe, blue-skinned beauty's hand. Smiling as he turned and walked away, Trav picks up his rucksack and waves good-bye to the rest of the *workers* in the back of the cantina.
"Sasa, Karna, Nana, Tori. Y'all make sure and behave yerselves while I'm gone, eh? I wouldn't want such beautiful girls to get hurt, forcing me to go shootin' people, ok?" The last bit of the comment was made while Trav was paying off his tab with the barkeep, looking the smaller, pudgier human in the eyes.
Walking out of The Happy Whiphid, Trav turned and headed for the observation deck, his folded up blaster carbine bobbing along on his thigh, his knife sitting on the other side for a nice cross draw.
So far, it had been a good day.
*Let's see if we can make it a better day.* Trav smiled to himself and begun humming a little diddy the girls had taught him as he walked along.

Sarn Octa walks down the ramp of the YT-2000 tosses a cred chip to the deck officer and makes his way to the Observation Deck. He runs his fingers through his black hair and tucks his hands in his black Rancor leather jacket that he wears over his flight suit.

The most direct route to the Observation deck is the express Turbolift that runs along the spine of Nova Point and connects all of the important decks. You easily find your to the lift, and notice others seem to be heading to the Observation deck as well.

JT-K1 "awakens" from his recharging in a hidden corner of one of the hanger bays, hearing the intriguing news. He immediately makes his way to the turbolift, eager to get a chance to actually do something. As he notes the others gathering around the lift to go up, he emits his closest approximation to a sigh. "With this many people going to sign up, I doubt they'll pick a droid to do whatever it is they want done. That is, unless it's dangerous and/or difficult for a fleshling." Still, his curiosity and boredom demand that he go and see what's going on.

Seeing the smaller human heading for the Observation point, Trav chuckled to himself before speaking up.
"Going to meet yourself a little lady, buddy? Tell you what. If she turns out to be too much trouble for ya', just head yerself on over to The Happy Whiphid. They gots the cleanest and nicest girls here 'bouts. Tell 'em ol' Trav sent ya', and they'll treat 'ya real nice."
Seeing the droid walking in the same direction also, Trav called out, "Hey! Bucket head! I think I saw some people tryin' to clean up an oil spill or somethin' like that back in the cargo bay. That's in the opposite direction." Trav makes a point of over-exaggerating his gestures when mentioning cleaning and the direction of the cargo bay, since he imagines the droid's faulty for heading in this direction.

Callra has had a rough time lately. A Wookie donÂ´t exactly blend in that well in the crowd, and for the sake of the crew he flies with, he has decided to leave them and let them fight the Empire on their own. He would have to find a way to add his strength to the various rebel factions somehow. But for now he had decided to get away for a while, and Nova Point was as good a place as any to leave the Empires sight temporarily.
As he stepped off the ship and into the docking bay, he noticed people looking at him. Of course he was quite used to that. Being a Wookie - and one as rugged as him - kind of guaranteed that people turned an eye towards you. And he bet the blade strapped to his hip and the bowcaster on his back did their share too.
As the announcement came out that people seeking work should gather at the observation deck, he decided it was as good a thing as any to look out. Looking for a quick way to get there, he stepped into the turbolift.

The turbolift door opens and the small group of people walks through, each member quickly finding somewhere to stand. Opposite the door the Lift's wall is completely transparent, made from inches thick transparisteel that provides a panoramic view of the surrounding asteroid field, and the Nova Rift Nebula in the distance. The doors shut slowly as an unpolished protocol droid manipulates the console and sends the lift hurtling upwards. Through the window you see small freighters come and go, weaving in between the asteroids and even a few starfighters that must be running escort. The Lift comes to an abrupt stop as the ascent completes and the doors slowly grind open.
The passengers begin to disperse into the large, hexagonal rooms that presents itself. The Observation deck is surrounded with transparent walls like those in the turbolift and many consoles are dotted across the large room, and aged Twi-lek man stands behind one near the center. The passengers seem to head towards him, it's clear he must be important.

An odd clicking noise comes from the JT-K1 as the annoying human man insults him. He might not have meant to, but it's certainly have J took it. As he enters the turbolift, he says to the man, "I am no mere sanitary unit." He decides it prudent to leave it at that for now rather than reveal his true function. When the lift arrives, he steps out and follows the crowd over to the Twi'lek. "This should be interesting."

Looking over at the droid, Trav looks legitimately surprised by its response.
"Hey, Rust Bucket. I didn't mean to go insultin' yur precious pride there. You must be one of them protocol droids or some such, ain't ya'?"
Then, looking the droid over and noticing the blaster rifle in its hands, Trav cocks his head to one side and whistles.
"Hey now. I don't think its kosher fer droids to be carryin' ordinance like that. Not that I personally give a care, but I know there's some folks 'round this here galaxy that wouldn' take too kindly to a droid with a weapon. Just watch yerself, there, Bucket Head. Don' go off pissin' the folks with the badges to go with their guns."
Sticking out his hand towards the droid, "I don' know what the prot-ah-call is fer saying hi to a droid and all, but my pa taught me to always shake hands and look a fella in the eyes. Or, I guess in your case, eye."
After the lift stops, Trav walks out onto the Observation Deck and lets loose another whistle. "Woooo weee! Look at that there view! Ain' that a perty sight? I gotta say."
Seeing the Twi'lek standing off to the side, Trav makes a bee line for him, "I gotta say there. You got the best lookin' office I've seen in a kath's age. All those asteroids floatin' 'round out there. Well, they look awful perty to me. Now, what's say we get down to business? What do ya' need doin' and how much do I get from it?"
Talking about money made Trav think quickly about Dani. It'd been nearly a month since he'd last deposited money in the account for his mother. He'd need another job soon enough if he wanted to keep helping out with Dani's treatments.

### **Tempeste** (2009-05-31 18:42:21)

The Twi-Lek smiled as Trav adressed him, "We'll get down to business shortly. Thanks for asnwering my call, and yes. It is a wonderful view isn't it?" He remarked whilst gesturing towards the Nebula, "They abandoned the station when their coffers ran empty, but I made her into something beautiful and amazing!" He took a few steps back and gestured for the crowd to quiten down, "For the past ten years we have lived under the Tyranny of the most oppressive empire. Under their iron fist which crushes and destroys anything it touches. We've managed to get by though, managed to survive and make a living whilst others are mistreated and killed," he stopped for a moment and looked upon the Nebula once more, it's swirling purples, blues and reds a stark contrast to the unending darkness of space.
"Now they threaten the very stars themselves.. And this is why I called you here today. If you aren't willing to put your life on the line and maybe even sacrifice it to help topple this evil regime then leave now." The man watches as a few men walk towards the door before stopping after a few steps, resolute. "You know me as Mughral, and we shall know each other as the men, women and droids who will make this galaxy as it should be once more!"
The crowd let out a cheer as Mughral stopped speaking and looked towards the men with a smile.

The droid stares at the human who stuck his hand out to shake. He seems to pause and think about something for a moment before he accepts the handshake, squeezing a bit stronger than the man might have been strictly comfortable with. "No offense taken then." With that he turns to listen to the Twi'lek's speech, but doesn't join in the following cheer. Out loud, but not terribly loudly, he says, "Well, everyone in this room will most likely be dead by the end of this venture. But, it'll be worth it to take revenge on the Empire."

## Re: Chapter 1: Nova Point

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-31 20:40:36)

As the TwiÂ´lek finished his speech, Callra joined in the cheering with a Wookie roar. This would probably be what he had been looking for. A chance to bring it back to the Empire.

Trav nods at the droid's harder than usual handshake. He doesn't reply, but he decides that he likes this droid.
Hearing the Twi'lek's speech, Trav doesn't respond like the rest of the crowd.
*I ain' got no love for the Empire, but I'm gonna be needing credits.*
Trav looks for a second like he's going to turn and leave, but then an idea strikes him.
*Hey! If we're gonna be actin' all rebellious against the Empire and what not, then odds are we're gonna be able to steal stuff and … stuff.*
Deciding that this might be a good venture, Trav stops turning and stands still.
"I'm in, just so long as I can steal money along the way. I gots ... expen-dee-tures to pay for."

### **Tempeste** (2009-06-01 08:55:20)

Mughral smiled before lowering his head for a moment, "You are brave men, but we cannot attack yet. We need to prepare.. We need to... We need to..." The aged Twi-Lek stuttered and his eyes opened wide in fear. He was now looking out behind the crowd of people, causing many to turn around and share his reaction. An alarm began to ring out to punctuate the arrival of a collosal, wedge shaped ship at the edge of the asteroid field, Fighters emerging from it's underbelly.
"Stay calm! They won't attack unless they find a reason to!" The Twi-lek was instantly proved wrong as a Tie Fighter screamed past the Deck, assaulting a fleeing vessel and causing it to explode in a spectacular fireball. The assembled smugglers and other scum now panicked and nearly filled the Turbolift. Mughral quickly pushed a few keys on the nearby console before joining them, "Now, is the time to run.." he said unenthusiastically.

"Called it." JT-K1 mutters, referring to his prediction that everyone here would likely be dead before long. "Even faster than I expected, though. Must be a new record of disappointment." He, unlike the frantic crowd, calmly walks back to the turbolift. "Well, we'd probably best get the brix out of here, I suppose."

Vor'en walks out of a aged frieghter that has just landed at this Shadow port. He had been working his way here as ships mechanic. The smell of engine coolent was still sharp in his nose. He is greeted by the news of more work. *"Well that is what I am here for."*He had been workingg with pirates and Smugglers for long enuff that most the hate he had for them was gone.
He makes his way to the meeting, where he listen to the old Twi'lek talk about what they should do about securing there lace place in the galaxy or what not. Some of the men there want to face the Empire head on, which would end there lives fast and flashy. He about to turn around to find another ship that need a crew when he heard the alarms sound and sounds of fighters screaming in on attack runs. As a ship explodes while trying to escape, he realizes that survival was now his top priority. "I need to get out of here fast or I will be sucking hard vacume."

Seeing the tie fighter fly screaming past the window and spitting fire on the base and several ships, Trav walks forward, keeping his right hand on the holstered carbine strapped to his leg. With his left hand, he grabs a hold of the Twi'lek and starts dragging him towards the turbolift.
"Alright, then. Here's the deal. Ya' got the mission information in ya'. That means that yer the ticket to the credits I need. So, I'm gonna save yer hide and get ya' out of here so that you don' die and I don' miss out on this chance. Now, ya' got a ship out of here, or do I need to find one?"
Trav says his bit as he continues to drag the Twi'lek by the arm towards the turbolift and keeping his eye on anyone who might be headed towards a specific hangar bay as opposed to just running wildly to the first one they find.

As the crowd started to move around and everyone seemed to make haste to try and reach their transports to get of the station, Callra looked around. As the ship he arrived with had left, he hadnÂ´t planned on leaving this place until he found some other transportation. Unfortunately, Shyriiwook isnÂ´t the most common of languages, so he wasnÂ´t sure if anyone would understand him as he let up a questioning sound.

### **Tempeste** (2009-06-02 15:19:40)

Mughral resists your efforts and pulls away, "That's all fine but I can walk by myself.. Now hurry." Another explosion rocked the station and threw many to the ground. Everyone makes it to the lift however, and it quickly begins to descend. Through the window you can now see TIE fighters dart around fleeing vessels, explosions lighting up the darkness briefly every few seconds. The large cruiser in the distance seems to be getting closer too.
It's wedge shaped hull and oversized weapons seem to hypnotise many of the smugglers, freezing them on the spot. Due to this none of them see the Crippled YT-1300 spiral out of control and collide with the station a few levels below. The glass floor now reveals that the steel spine connecting the lift to the station exterior is warped and twisted.
Mughral tries to act quickly, pushing the slowly acting protocol droid away from the console, but his efforts to slow the descent seem in vain...

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-02 17:09:26)

Hearing the Twi'lek's comment, Trav was about to assert himself, till it occured to him that the head-tailed alien was headed in the right direction anyway. Climbing into the turbolift, he heard the Wookie bark something out, but had no idea what he was saying. As the lift began to descend, like everyone else, he missed the spiraling ship slamming into the station. He didn't miss, however, the effects of the warped station's spine. As the lift fell and continued to fall, Trav's memories of working on broken machinery came to mind and he moved to shove the Twi'lek over.
"Don'cha understand what's gotta be done? **<span style="font-size: 1.05em;">MOVE!</span>**"
After shoving the Twi'lek out of the way, Trav pulled out a hydrospanner out of the tool kit on his belt and moved to pull the panel from the floor of the lift. Pulling the panel aside, he saw what he hoped he was remembering right to be the emergency break, and yanked hard.

The metallic grid quickly comes away but the emergancy brake hardly budges as you pull it. It seems it hasn't been maintained properly in years, it's going to take more effort. Meanwhile, the lift continues to hurtle downwards.

With the sudden exhaleration of the turbolift took alittle out of Vor'en. He was used to piloting stuff that went just as fast, but in this case he had little control over what was happening. "Stopping would be a good thing guys!" he did mean to state the obveous he just really didn't want to die in a turbo lift not a great way to go out. As his head slams against the wall he wisjed he had lift ihis helment on. His head moves to his blaster carbine if thing got stopped they might have a fight on there hands and he wanted to be ready.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-06-03 02:30:12)

As he spots some of the others having trouble making the breaks to the lift function, the Wookie lets out a high roar. Perhaps a little more roughly than necessary, he shoves the others - including the frustrated human who had tried stopping the lift - out of the way. He grabs the brake handle with both hands and pulls with all his might.

### **Tempeste** (2009-06-03 07:14:49)

The turbolift screeches to a halt as the wookie roars, pulling the handle straight up and stopping the descent just in time. The Lift holds still, mere metres above the twisted metallic rail. Luckily the lift stopped at a floor and not inbetween them, which would have left everyone stranded. The Door grinds open after a few seconds of tense silence and Mughral quickly leaves, seeming pleased to have his feet back on solid ground, or so he thought.
Another explosion rips through the station, knocking everyone to the floor, and the lift begins to buckle, the brakes straining.All of you are lucky, and the blast knocks you into the corridor but the other smugglers aren't so, and the lift breaks away from the station, the blast door quickly closing to close the gap.
Mughral looks tired, "We need to keep moving.. We're the only ones left now."
You're now stood in a long narrow corridor with numerous doors on each side, with a console beside each.
"We should be on the engineering level, we need to find a route down to the Hangar bays, I have a ship. She's fast enough to get us out alive.."

You easily manage to activate a nearby console and bring up a small map. It seems to only show the local area however and doesn't extend to the entire station. it does however, show a large control room nearby, used to moniter the stations reactor. It seems there'll be a more expansive map inside, luckily it's just down the corridor a few doors away on the left.
"Yes. Yes I am sure you do. Which Hangar bay did you land in?" replied Mughral.

"92...92.." The Twi-lek repeated the word a few times, searching his memory, trying to remember the docking manifests he was reading a few moments before this had all began. "No... You came in the Azure Blue? Of course you don't call her that anymore.. What happened to. Oh nevermind, we can talk about that when we get to safety." Mughral takes a few steps down the corridor, "Yes, The Monitoring station should give us a good escape route, it's map is updated in realtime so we won't be caught in any dead ends.."

Callra cautiously follows the others, his senses on full alert, expecting danger to follow at any time. He unhooks the Ryyk blade at his side, gripping its reversed handle and feeling the cold metal rub against his forearm. As Sarn opens a door, he prepares, peering into the opening.

The door opens to reveal a square shaped room with dark walls lined with consoles apart from one which has only one, which sits at the centre of a large window. In the centre of the room is a large Holotable, currently displaying the status of the stations core. Mughral enters after you and types a quick passkey into the centre table, a 3d image of the station appears shortly after. Lines of various colours flash across it as the console tries to find the quickest route down to the docking bays.
Moments later the view zooms into a map of the current level, Mughral studies it before speaking up. "There is a route to bay 92, Look here" He says whilst tracing his finger along a mauve, dotted line, "It won't be a long journey, but we have to pass through the reactor chamber, it's harmless though, don't worry. Then we can move down these emergancy stairs and quickly reach the outer edge of the station, from which we can move along to the docking bay.. Simple, any questions?"

He does, however, mutter under his "breath" as he does. "This is completely ridiculous.

"The reactor is this way," states Mughral as he catches up with you in the corridor and begins to lead the way. "just through this door here." The aforementioned door opens to reveal the large reactor chamber. You come out onto a ledge which is connected to a platform in the centre of the room by a bridge, and then that platform is connected to the exit via another bridge. It's a long way down however, and the reactor power lines trail down the walls in huge bundles. About ten metres up the wall opposite you is a small platform, inaccessable from your current position.
"Be careful here, some have fallen down before.." Mughral begins to walk across the first bridge, slowly and methodically, this wasn't the place to rush.
For a second a few of you think you can hear footsteps from the opposite doorway but the humming of the reactor below makes you uncertain.

Suddenly the door opposite opens, and you hear the voice of a man shouting. It goes quiet for a moment before the offendor appears in the doorway. A relatively short man dressed in the pressed grey uniform of an imperial officer. "Secure the area now! I don't want any of them to esc.." He trails off as he notices you, "Guards..."
The Officer takes a few steps forward whilst stroking a well kept, greying goatee, quickly joined by 3 armour clad soldiers.
"Stormtroopers!" Shouts Mughral as he raises his pistol, "You scum can't leave this galaxy in peace can you!? You'd rather see it in pieces."
"Scum? You will call me Liuetenant Varris.. Pieces? Yes, what a brilliant idea. I'll throw your 'pieces' right into the reactor core down there. You can be destroyed by this rusty station that you love so much. Soldiers, kill him!"
The three stormtroopers advance as the officer retreats through the doorway, "Oh, and dispose of the body," he adds before dissapearing.

Looking at the oncoming troopers, Trav temporarily considers shooting the Twi'lek and hoping for a reward, but then he remembers previous experiences with stormies. They tended to shoot everyone down and sort out the pieces later. Well, he wasn't getting shot down, that was for sure. Leveling his carbine at the nearest trooper, Trav fired off a bolt at the white armored moron. He really wished the karkin' droid hadn't gotten in the way, then he'd just mow them down in one fell swoop.

JT-K1 charges forward but fails to reach the stormtrooper and so doesn't attack. Trav's shot is right on target however and the beam of energy hits a stormtroopers in the chest. He screams somewhat as he falls to the ground, his armour making a loud thump as it collided with the metal, mesh floor. Sarn's shot is wide however, and impacts a few metres above the door behind the stormtroopers. Vor'en, the furthest away from the stormtroopers, misses badly. The two stormtroopers now fire across the bridge and one nearly hits Mughral. The smell of burnt ozone stays in his mouth however as he fires a return shot, hitting one of the enemy in the leg, causing him to nearly fall over. The wookie's shot misses two, the quarrel rings past overhead.

Looking down and realizing that Mughral had taken a hit, Trav turned his attention to finishing off the troopers quickly.

Trav knew they wouldn't be able to keep this up for long, switching Salli (his rifle) over to Bertha (grenade launcher), Trav lightly kissed the weapon before lining up the shot that he hoped would take out the rest of the stormies.
After firing the weapon, Trav scanned the area looking for the other assailant.

The recoil of firing on full autofire causes JTs shots to miss, peperring the space around the stormtroopers but failing to do any damage. Trav has more luck however as the grenade flies through the air, exploding at the feet of the armour clad troopers, sending them both flying into the air and down into the abyss. As Trav's eye follows one of the flailing troopers, he spot that the platform above where the enemy were stood is now occupied by a Scout trooper, wielding a long barrelled blaster rifle.

Even though his words are meant to convince himself that he's uncaring, his quietness as he says them speaks of another feeling instead. Trav begins patting the dead Twi'lek down for anything he might have.

Taking the frag grenade, Trav slid it into place in Bertha, topping her off again. Replacing the rucksack on his shoulders, Trav slung the blaster rifle across his back before lovingly holding the Twins in his hands again. Salli and Bertha had served him well today. He'd have to make sure that they got plenty of oil and a good cleaning when he got back to that ship someone had mentioned.

Vor'en readys himself behind the creates. Checking the charge on his blaster carbine. "Boy this reminds of some times I would have soon forgotten." It was that time when he was with that RC team. It was some Sep base, they had to get in get some intell and blow the place into a large hole in the ground. As usual it didn't go as planed, much like this situation he was in now. *"I wonder what happened to those lads. They where good at what they did, They really pulled my fat out of the fire on that one."*His thoughts roamed back to that time. he tryed to beary his past, but sometimes it was hard. As he hears the sounds of battle start he pops up from behind the creats and fires.

Trav's volley of fire manages to gun down two of the Troopers as they run through the door, knocking them onto their backs, dead. JT isn't as successful however and his attack yields no results, the shots hitting the ceiling above the troopers. The scout trooper looks down the scope of his rifle and takes aim for a second before unleashing a shot towards Callra, the Wookie. It seems something throws off his aim however as the shot harmlessly pings off one of the durasteel crates. Callra responds in kind, firing a shot that hits the Trooper in the chest, his armour seems to deflect the damage though as he shrugs it off. (Natural Twenty to hit here but bad roll for damage, so he's still alive.)
Sarn fires off a shot as well, though it misses somewhat badly, doing no damage to anything, apart from the corridors metal wall. Vor'en then pops up to fire, and his brilliantly placed shot hits one of the remaining stormtroopers right between the (helmet protected) eyes, sending him to an early grave. (Another Natural Twenty, enough damage to kill the Trooper twice over)
The remaining stormtrooper is visually put off by this, his attack missing horribly, firing from the hip doesn't help it seems.
As The soldier's head hits the floor with a clunk you hear more footsteps down the corridor, needless to say, reinforcements seem to have arrived for the somewhat incompetent Stormtrooper and his Scout Trooper ally. Four more Stormtroopers appear, quickly taking up position ahead of the scout trooper (who is still stood on the far end of the doorway) and use the edges of the doorway for cover.

Travot's fire catches two Stormtroopers unaware, hitting them both with glancing shots but not doing enough damage to put them down. The damage forces one into an exposed position however, allowing JT's shot to finish him off. Unaffected by the death of his comrade the Scout trooper lines up another shot aimed at Callra and hits right on target (17 damage and -1 step on condition track for Callra.) Callra raises his Bowcaster to shoot and unleashes a pinpoint attack, hitting the assailant again, square in the chest, knocking him backwards and onto the ground with a thump. (Another Natural twenty here, did enough damage to finish him off.) As Sarn pops off a quick shot he manages to down another stormtrooper, who falls limp to the ground. Vor'en's attack is futile and fails to do any damage. The three surviving troopers let off a flurry of shots, one misses whilst the other two hit their targets. One shot hits Travot (18 damage, -1 on condition track) whilst the other hits Sarn hard (17 damage, -1 condition track.)

The launched grenade detonates amidst two of the troopers and cuts their lives short whilst a well placed shot from JT downs the remaining soldier. The corridor is now clear save the mounting pile of dead bodies, and the distant door attempts to shut, but the helmet of a trooper has it wedged open.
The Turbolift is speeding up now and arrives after a few tense seconds. It isn't empty however as the thick durasteel doors open to reveal a very surprised looking stormtrooper who immediately drops his rifle in shock as he sees you. "No No! I'm just a recruit..

Trav, as soon as it was obvious that the troopers were dead, leaped over the barricades and ran over towards the now dead troopers. He was definitely interested in the sniper rifle the scout trooper had been carrying, along with ammo, but he kept his eyes open for anything else of interest.

Trav looks down at the body of the boy in a man's uniform. He couldn't have been much older than Dani. Trav wondered what kind of family the boy had left behind when he joined up. Had they been proud of their boy? Had they hated and feared his decision? Did his mother cry and plead with him to rethink and not go off to war?
Or, had the boy been *recruited* at the point of a blaster carbine, with his family being held as *collateral*? Trav wondered these things for a moment before squatting down by the boy's head. Placing his hand on the boy's face, Trav moved his hand downwards, closing the eyes. Quickly searching the body, Trav found the boy's ID chip that stormtroopers had in their uniforms to help identify them to other troopers. Pulling out his knife, Trav pried the ID chip off of the uniform and slipped it into his pocket. He finished by taking whatever weapons and ammo the boy had on him, though it looked like he wasn't happy about the manner of taking it.
*I'm sorry, boy. I'd'ave left ya alive. I hope that I can get this here ID chip to yer family one day.*
Standing, Trav turned and looked at the droid.
"Ya know, Bucket Head? He was surrenderin'. All ya had ta do wuz shoot ta stun, an' he'd a bin no threat at all. T's one thing to kill in battle when yur life's on the line an' all that, but what ya did was murder, cold and simple. It may not matter to ya, but it matters to me. I like ta know what kin' of folks I run with, ya know? I like ta know what we're on the same page an' all that."
Turning back towards the group and headed for the turbo-lift, Trav mentioned to Sarn. "Which level wuz yer ship on?"
After the group gets into the lift, Trav checks on the Twins again, making sure they were ready to go. He set the brace in his shoulder again and pointed the gun at the door, ready to shoot his way to Sarn's ship if needed.

JT-K1 nods at Trav's mini-speech, replying totally calmly, "Duly noted. However, I aim to make certain that any man, woman, or child who serves the Empire dies. In a sense, the blaster bolt I put through his head could be considered merciful considering some of the other, more gruesome methods I could have used to kill him." With that, JT turns to the turbolift, waiting for it to arrive.

## Re: Chapter 1: Nova Point

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-15 16:56:52)

It was with a heavy heart that Trav pulled the power packs from the tten-age boy's body. No doubt he'd lived a short, and now violent, life. However, that didn't stop Trav from taking the scavenged power packs. He knew all too well the value of extra ammo in the field. Countless times in his life as a mercenary, his only salvation from a brutal and quick death by blaster was the fact that he had more ammunition than his enemies. Ammunition that he used on auto-fire shots over and over again. It was one of the facts that had made Trav such a successful mercenary, the fact that he kept firing when everyone else had gone empty. It still didn't make him feel any better about absconding with a dead boy's possessions.
Neither did taking the frag grenade, though the feel of the smooth, round, orb of destruction had always made Trav feel giddy. This was the type of weapon that would allow Trav to take out several troopers at once. Trav remembered one time, when four troopers had been just outside his door, all bunched up together. Oh, the cleaning droids had some work to do that day. He's just taken out the grenade, rolled it out the door, and shut the door before diving behind a desk for protection. The explosion had made his ears ring for a few minutes, but the imagined faces he'd conjured up of the troopers soiling their pristine, white armor made him happy for months to come. He told that story to the girls at cantinas for a full year after **that**. And, now the full weight of Bertha, fully loaded, made Trav a more confident man again. He didn't like to run around without back up ammo, which was why he scavenged off of so many dead troopers. The dead don't need weapons, but Trav still would for as long as he was alive.
Trav sighed to himself as Sarn took the blaster carbine the boy had dropped. Trav didn't sell weapons, he collected them. He'd had a friend when he'd first signed on with the freighter that took him off world for the first time, who had more weapons than he could ever carry around at once. He'd kept them mounted on the wall above his bunk, waiting to be used. Once a standard week, Trav would watch as this master mercenary would take each of his weapons apart, cleaning out each of the crevices of any dust they had accumulated during a week of no use. This was on top of the cleanings he'd given them after each mission. It didn't matter whether or not the man had used the pistol, rifle, grenade launcher, or cannon during the fight, he'd clean it and keep it up. He'd often told Trav, "A man's only as good as his weapon. If you ever pull the trigger on a weapon, and it don't fire, your dead. You take care of your weapons, and they'll take care of you." The man had called his weapons by the names of his children who he'd sent most of his income to. It made them seem like family. After knowing him, Trav'd gotten the habit of calling his weapons by the names of women he'd loved. It made him love them more, which made him take better care of them.
Finally finished with putting away power packs and reloading Bertha, Trav took a minute to calm his nerves. During the fight, the bolt he took to the shoulder had shaken him up a bit, but he hadn't had time to calm down in the heat of battle. But now, riding a turbo lift down towards the other human's ship, he had that moment. Taking a few quick breaths (a trick that old mercenary had shown him) rushed oxygen into his blood and helped to calm the nerves. The slight trembling in his hands steadied, and Trav was holding the Twins again with the tenderness of a lover again. And, like that old mercenary had said, his love of the weapons meant they wouldn't fail him when the time came. When the moment came, they'd save him by killing others, just like they'd done before.
Trav looked at the numbers, and waited for the human to answer his question about what level the ship was on. The sooner he got off of this station, the better it would be.

The awkward silence is broken as a familiar voice buzzes over the lift's intercom, "Nice work there, but you're not out of this mess yet.

Kneeling down, Trav felt the cold, hard, unrelenting durasteel beneath his knee on the bottom of the turbo-lift. That last comment from their unknown director made Trav worry, just a bit, about what was coming when those doors opened on the docking bay.
Once on his knees, Trav made sure that the Twins were set so that Salli was the one speaking, and that she was set to say one energy-laden word at a time. Extending Salli's stock so that he could brace as needed, Trav backed her big, beautiful rear into his shoulder. Trav remembered the last time he'd held the real Salli. Her twin sister, Bertha, had been unavailable (which made Trav a little sad), she'd backed her big beautiful end ...
Trav snapped himself back to reality. Now wasn't the time to get lost in the memories of old romances, no matter how cute those Twi'lek twins were. Settling Salli's stock into his shoulder, Trav looked down his girl's sight and made himself ready for a moment's notice blaster fight, just in case.

The cold in the air made Trav worry just a bit.

Trav wasn't in the lest bit interested in running out into a potentially vacuum-like situation. He'd seen on many occasions (often caused by himself) what happened to a being's body when exposed to the vacuum of space. Things tended to go pop.
Deciding to wait for confirmation from the other human, Trav stayed in his crouched position, looking for trouble inside the hangar bay.
Then Trav realized something, albeit in a slow manner for a human. He couldn't see that well in the dark. Deciding he needed light, but didn't want to fold up the Twins into pistol mode, Trav took out his glow rod and his mesh tape, and taped the glow rod to the Twins, quietly apologizing to them for the inconvenience. Then, replaceing his mesh tape to his utility belt, Trav turned on the glow rod and began casting his rifle, with it's now accompanying glow rod, back and forth across the cargo bay, checking for any potential problems.

Upon closer inspection it seems the Crimson Fox is in the room directly to your left. Docking bay 92 is in a sorry state, through the window you see cables and refueling pipes snaked across the floor. And it seems some looting has taken place. The ship itself is fine however, and you also notice the distinctive outline of a sleek Scyk light Fighter. The room has power for now, the magnetic shield keeping the valuable atmosphere inside. It may not hold for much longer though, as the increasingly frequent dimming of lights suggests.

Trav didn't have to be told by the droid to move twice.
(Assuming that Captain Sarn's telling everyone immediately which way to head.)
Running out of the turbo lift, Trav quickly ducked inside the indicated cargo bay and began waving the Twins with their taped on glow rod back and forth as he moved his way towards the ship's docking ramp. Something about the room made him feel a bit worried. He knew that if he wanted to wait for folks trying to leave the station, he'd wait in a full cargo bay.
He also knew that each breath he took might easily be his last. Power fluctuating, cables down, lights flickering. Any moment he expected the magnetic field to collapse and the atmosphere to leave. He just planned to be aboard a ship before that happened.

He writes down on a flimsy 3 short hop destinations and runs it out to Vor'en **"Here jump to these coordinates this should throw off any tails."** He then runs back to the Fox and straps in.

Hearing the engines roar to life on both the freighter and the fighter, Trav looks out and sees the droid and the Wookie standing about, as if guarding the bay doors. Pulling on the microphone hanging off of his head and called out.

Aboard your respective ships you easily exit the hangar and into the void of space. Your navicomputer's state how you must escape the asteroid field which surrounds Nova Point station before you can make any jumps to hyperspace. Both ships almost make it out of the field before your sensors pick up incoming Hostiles. Two Tie Fighters are dead ahead and they don't seem very friendly. The quickly close in on your position and let loose with attacks, they're off target however and impact harmlessly on nearby asteroids.

Looking out into the black, Trav can't see anything with the naked eye, but he sees on the sensors that there are two ties out there. Trav considers for a second if he should wait for Sarn to tell him to shoot, until the ties shoot at them.
"Karkin' idjots! They wanna fight? Let's give 'em a fight!"
Knowing that the shots were likely to be long ones, Trav used the sensors to line up the shot. If nothing else, it would let the ties know that they had problems to deal with.

A small asteroid pelts the wing of Voren's fighter as he propels the ship forward, causing the shields to flare up in order to repel the chunk of void born rock. Small rocks pelt the Crimson Fox as it weaves between the larger asteroids, the engines humming loudly. Travot must have mistaken a small asteroid for a Tie fighter as his attack misses and harmlessly detonates the spiraling chunk of rock. The Tie fighter has much more luck however, and it's green hued laser bolts penetrate the shields of the M3-A Scyk fighter battering the pilot as it scorches the armour plating beneath. (Critical Hit, 22 damage, SR reduced by 5) The same fighter then loops back on itself and attempts to follow up with a second attack. It misses however, and leaves itself exposed to return fire (Segnor's Loop) The second Tie Fighter moves to support it's comrade and moves into position to fire upon the Scyk Fighter. As it banks to the left and snaps off a few shots, it's narrowly missed by a large asteroid, throwing off the pilot's shot and causing him to miss.

"Frak it all, man! What're ya doin'? The ties are in the **other** direction! And, more importantly, that man out ther's one of them what fought with us through the station! Ya gonna just leave 'im out there?"

Vor'en's lack of experience in a Starfighter begins to show as his shots his their mark. The Crimson Fox barrels and arcs through the asteroid field, intent on aiding it's beleagured comrade. It narrowly avoids various smaller asteroids, and banks to avoid a larger one. As it passes the final asteroid a Tie Fighter comes into Travot's view and is promptly vapourised by a trio of well placed shots, fragments of the hull fly in all directions, and the pilot's shattered body floats, lifeless from the broken cockpit. The remaining Tie Fighter misses his shot again, much to the pilot's frustration.

The jump to hyperspace goes without a hitch and after a few minutes you find your ship motionless in deep space. Far from any planet, and hopefully any imperial patrols. It's now that you notice the Crimson Fox's cargo holds actually still contain some cargo from the previous owner's last job.

Trav catches the Data pad before stuffing it back into his rucksack.
"Yeah, like I'm gonna be able ta figure that thing out."
Walking towards the common area of the ship, Trav found a table and began setting out his weapons, including the new additions. He begins to dismantle each one, starting with the Twins, and to clean them out and get them ready. He remembered something that old tracker had told him. *You get the chance, you clean your gear. You never know how long it'll be till the next chance and you want your gear to work for you. Elsewise, you might not make it to the next chance.*
He started running through his mind the ideas he had on what to do with the blaster rifle. It might make a fine sniper rifle. Just remove the auto-fire mechanism, add on a targeting scope, maybe a range finder. Add a bi-pod, and before you know it, his little harem would have a beautiful new addition.
As to the blaster pistol, no ideas were coming just yet, but it might not be a bad idea to just have a regular blaster pistol laying around, in case of emergencies.
Now, the Twins. He had some serious ideas for them. For Salli, he could remove the stun setting and add on extra power packs. Maybe Bertha could use an upgrade to, just not sure what yet. Maybe she could hold more grenades. He also thought that perhaps he could get his hands on a vibro-blade and hook it up with a bayonet ring, give the girls some teeth.
Whenever the captain made his towards the common area, Trav will look up and mention the data-pad. He'll also offer his services as a gunman for the time being.

As Travot walks into the ship's lounge a room positioned near the center of the craft, his eyes are drawn to a particlarly bulky set of durasteel crates in one of the cargoholds. There are 5 of the crates in total and each looks as though it was built to survive a bomb going off, they surely contain something of value. Elsewhere in the cargohold you notice palletes overflowing with computer parts and machinery. Much of the cargo seems to have spilled from their respective homes, probably during the ship's recent combat manouvers. Near the piles of electronic components is the still gleaming body of an airspeeder. It looks to be straight from the factory, though is clearly unfinished, as panels are open, revealing unfinished wiring. Finally, Travot notices unsecured, refrigerated crates full of various fruits.

Trav took a moment from cleaning his new blaster pistol and looked up, noticing the crates of gear.
"Ooooh! Nice!"
Getting up from the table, Trav holstered the new blaster pistol in his belt. It would have to do until he found a real holster. Walking over towards the crates, Trav began to search each one, taking a moment to grab a fruit and cut off a piece with his knife and begin eating. It had been a few hours since Trav'd eaten last and he was hungry. He began rummaging through the machinery parts, checking to see if he'd find a targeting scope, or some other kit that he could use on his weaponary. When he'd found what he'd found there, he looked at the durasteel crates and whislted.
"Whew! I gotta say. What ever's in these here crates gotta be worth somethin'!"
Pulling out his miniaturized tool kit, Trav knelt down beside one of the crates and began working the lock. A trick that the old tracker had taught him.

## Re: Chapter 1: Nova Point

### **Tempeste** (2009-07-04 19:08:00)

It takes a few minutes to bypass the lock, during which Travot nearly destroyed the entire mechanism on two occasions, which would have effectively sealed the Crate forever, unless it was cut open. The interior of the durasteel crate is padded with soft material upon which rests at least 50 blaster rifles, mostly partially dissasembled to allow easier transport, though anyone skilled with a blaster could easily reassemble them. Judging from this single crate, there must be at least 250 blaster rifles spread out over the 5 crates.
The rifles themselves are all very similar, though Travot doesn't recognise the model.

As Travot works his fingers across the weapon, reassembling it, he notices certain things seem odd.

*Oh, right. Some folks have issues 'bout this kinda thing.*
Looking up, Trav put both hands up in a non-violent gesture.
"Now, cap'n. Don' go gettin' yerself all uppettied over this. I's just curious as to what kinda cargo ya wuz carryin'. Though' per-maybe-haps ya could use an extra hand in movin' the stuff.

Stepping away from the table to emphasize that he had no intentions of stealing the blaster, Trav continued.
"So, since yer cartin' illegal material cross the galaxy, ya oughta think 'bout yer security.

Sarn spins around on his chair and studies the navicomputer, hitting a few keys before the display shows Nar Shadaa, with some basic information accompanying it, "I think it's as good a destination as any, the empire have no presence there either," he finished, now looking over the datapad.

"..." JT-K1 remains silent, debating this turn of events. On the one hand, he saw no way that going to Nar Shaddaa to de-encrypt the datapad could possible hurt the Empire. One the other hand, he was curious as to what was on the datapad, and if it was plans for the Empire's latest superweapon or something, then he would be interested. Finally, he nods, "Count me in. Let's go."

"Cool it Trav, Nar Shadaa it is then," Sarn pushes down the comm button again, "We're heading to Nar Shadaa, sending co-ordinates now," with that done he advises the others to take seat before plotting the course and jumping to hyperspace.
The ship lurches as it drops back into realspace and anyone in the cockpit is greeted with a view of Nar Shadaa, and further in the distance, Nal Hutta. The moon seems to grow bigger as you approach, eventually descending into the atmosphere of the world. Sarn finds an empty landing platform though it's owner didn't reply to any communications, he must have been away, or maybe worse. The landing platform itself looks as though it's seen better days, the supports look somewhat delapidated and beneath it is a sheer drop which could go on for miles.
Vor'en and his ship land on an adjacent platform which is connected to the larger one via a small walkway.
It seems someone has noticed your arrival however, as on the landing platform you're greeted by a group of armed creatures of various species. Each more rough looking than the last. "I'll stay in the cockpit, keep an eye on the ship," says Sarn.

Trav had spent most of the flight in cleaning the twins and going over his new acquisitions, though he had trouble pronouncing the name a few times. Trav had been standing (he has trouble sitting still) in the cockpit, behind Sarn as the human landed the ship. Looking at the landing pad, Trav smirked.
"Don' look like this be a real good spot ta land the ship, Cap'n. Looks like it's gonna fall any minute now."
Noticing the armed thugs walking up towards the ship, Trav raised an eyebrow. Hearing Sarn's comments, he scoffed in disgust and turned to walk towards the boarding ramp.
"Ya yella-livered sissy. Ok, let's let the **real** men go ta work, then. Ya comin', Rusty?"
Tucking the pistol into his belt and putting the Twins in their customized holster, Trav held his new rifle in his hands, having set it to auto-fire. Walking down the ramp, Trav tried to get a feel for the group approaching them. Size, armaments, temperaments, etc.

Travot notices that the 4 men are armed with blaster pistols of various sizes, and a few have bladed weapons in holsters, probably vibro. Standing before them is a pale skinned near human wearing an immaculate pale blue outfit, who you may recognise as an Umbaran, she has deep piercing eyes and watches as you disembark the ship.
"I believe you have something for me," she says calmly, in a distinct inner rim accent.

Turning his eyeballs inside his head in the direction JT pointed out, Trav started keeping everybody in his view. However, realizing that his list of targets was steadily growing, he switched the rifle (maybe Janey? What about Nana? Hard to pick a decent name.) over to autofire mode. He was going to need to start making shots soon, he figured.
He briefly wondered how the captain knew that this was his contact for the arms deal, but he didn't voice it. Trav was sure that the captain knew what he was doing. Besides, Captain had made the deal to start with. Surely he'd know who they were supposed to be dealing with.

The Umbaran signals one of the men to check the crate with her hands. A rodian thug approaches the crate and keys it open, looking satisfied he nods to the Umbaran. "And the rest," she says whilst motioning to the Crimson Fox, "your payment will be handled by my employer before you ask."
The Bothans continue to approach, hugging shadows cast by looming skyscrapers as they approach the thugs. When Travot speaks the bothans ignore him and the thugs just look on dumbfounded. Some exclaiming words which surely mean 'idiot' or something to that effect in their native tongues. Moments later an Iktochi thug recoils and frantically grabs at his throat as a one of the bothans attempts to choke him, with what seems to be a strand of simple wire. As the horned thug struggles with his assailant, a nearby scruffy Houk falls to the ground, a small fountain of blood spurting from his back as the second bothan pulls back his small blade.

Remaining thugs are about 12 squares from the ramp of the ship, the umbaran is only 8 squares. Vor'en is 18 squares from the ship, but has a clear view of the platform's happenings.

Travot's gun spits death as the rifle unleashes a flurry of shots. One impacts the choking thug in the chest, cutting his life short whilst another hits the stumbling Bothan behind him, searing his shoulder. The Umbaran looks on in slight shock as her henchmen are cut down, she then looks towards Travot and sneers, "You're seriously trying to double cross Garma, he'll have your heads for this!" She then tried to find a route away from the ship, running around the melee. The bothan previously wielding a knife takes the heavy blaster pistol from his prey, quickly targeting the Rodian thug and shooting him in the upper chest and causing his body to flop lifelessly onto the crate of weapons.The second bothan also takes a fallen weapon, cutting the last thug down after quickly advancing. The hired muscle falls to the ground clutching his stomach, blood seeping through a deep wound.

The two bothans glance at each other before fleeing themselves, they dissapear in the same direction as the Umbaran.

"You'll be coming with us now, and you'll come without killing anymore of my men." As he finished speaking his men advance, and the Chagrian requests for you to put your weapons on the ground.

Sarn turns hits the close and lock button on his ship sealing it and the cargo that was on the ramp inside. he turns back crossing his arms and leans on the landing gear. **"Ok have it your way. The cargo stays here till I get payment. As I said your men were attacked by others. If I wanted to cheat you out of the cargo I would not have come here."**

"Payment, Payment?! You should be glad you're still alive! That is your payment. Unlock your ship or we'll destroy it, those crates are triple durasteel alloy encased, they'll survive the explosion whilst your ship won't." The chagrian looks on in disgust, as though you'd personally offended him.

Trav gets the impression that the negotiations might not be going that well and feels his trigger finger itching. But, the last order he'd been given was to lower his rifle, so he kept it low. However, he quietly switched over to Bertha and turned just enough to catch Sarn in his peripheral vision. At the moment his captain said so, Trav would launch a grenade at the thugs.

But you will not get the cargo as long as you are threatening me and not providing what was agreed upon. I can't help it if your men allow themselves to be attacked by Bothans. So you can attack us destroy the ship and get nothing for your troubles or you can calm down pay me for my troubles and be on your way with your guns"** Sarn says meeting the chagrians eyes looking calm as if he couldn't care less if he dies.

He thinks to himself. "Hey Sarn, I realize that the credits are important, but if we aren't alive to spend them it does us little good. Why don't we just step aside let him have is cargo and then maybe we can discuss this when everybody has calmed down a bit." Vor'en hopes that Sarn will listen to reason before the shooting started.

The Chagrian finishes counting and orders his men to open fire. The speeders do so first, each unleashing flurries of bright blue energy bolts towards the party. A trio of bolts impact with Travot's torso and a fourth hits him in the thigh, he falls to the ground lifeless as smoke rises from his charred clothes. The weapon pointed at Sarn fires too, and he's hit in the arm, then the stomach, and he's also knocked to the floor. (I'm going to assume you spend a forcepoint to stay alive, or a destiny point to have the attack miss) The third speeder fails to hit any party members, instead it just leaves a series of scorch marks on the Crimson Fox's hull.

Blasterbolts continue to fly through the air for a few moments before a deathly silence embraces the landing pad. Everything goes dark...
You awaken in a damp, cold room. Each party member is lucky to be alive, some have bandages covering wounds whilst others have new scars. Sarn and Vor'en are accompanied by an armoured stranger whilst JT activates within what looks like an armoury. The damp cell has a single barred door which is guarded by at least one guard, the armoury is unguarded, it seems that they didn't expect the droid to reactivate by itself, which is odd as they've clearly patched it up in a few places.

Vor'en stands and checks himself over. "Next time you pull a stupid stunt like that your not going to have to worry about getting shot by the crime lord. I'll beat him to it." He looks at the stranger that is with them. "How did we get here? Laser brain here decided that credits where worth more then our lives where." He points at Sarn.

Vor'en's search yields no results, it seems the cell is empty apart from a tattered blanket and the three prisoners. The guard can't resist the prospect of attacking an unarmed prisoner, who seems to be wearing some expensive armour. The door swings open and the guard steps in with a vibro-axe in hand. Nemesis gets the drop on him and manages to pound his skull with the layered steel of his helmet but the Aqualish guard is only momentarily stunned. He swings his axe but misses in the tight confines of the room and the weapon scrapes against the wall above Nemesis.

As Vor'en tries to open the door, he notices that it seems to be stuck. He struggles for a few moments before the door opens, unluckily it swings around and slams into the door making a loud thump. Beyond the doorway a guard rolls over on his bunk, in fact the bulk of the room is filled with two lines of 4 bunks. Many have bodies lying in them, it seems despite the loud disturbance, they're all still asleep. At the other end of the dark, cramped room is a door similar to the one you just walked through, though it's clearly marked as the armoury.

The small group continues to edge forward quietly, and they're soon at the armoury door. It opens with a small squeak and inside it looks like a typical armoury. There's lockers along two walls, a few tables covered in equipment, and the far end of the room houses another turbolift which is marked as leading directly to the landing platform.

The lockers, strangely enough seem locked. But the tables yield better results. There's half a dozen grenades, three standard blaster pistols of varying designs, and a blaster rifle. Sarn picks up a Pistol and grenade, but stops when he notices a familiar stripped down Blaster carbine which has 'Salli' scratched near the handle. It's Travot's old carbine, it seems the crimelord's looted his lifeless body. His Grenade launcher is nowhere to be seen though, it must be locked away.

Vor'en looks on the table for a tool kit or something that might allow him to gain access to the lockers. "Well I guess finding our gear is out of the question." He lays the blaster pistol he had on the table and picks up the blaster pistols laying there. Next he check over the blaster rifle that is also laying on the table. "They must have been cleaning them or something. I need a tool kit to open the lockers and find out what is inside of them. You guys see one anywhere?"
He slides the power pack out of the blaster pistol to make sure it is charged, then he does the same for the blaster rifle. He looks at the table. "Some must have been working on this one. If I had a tool kit I could put it back together wee could use all the weapons we could get."

The Blaster is quickly restored to it's former state after almost a minute of tinkering. Vor'en also quickly opens the lockers once done, still keeping quiet. The lockers yield Vor'ens' Heavy blaster pistol and the rest of his and Sarn's belongings, Travot's grenade launcher is also there, but it seems to be damage beyond repair. One locker, tucked away contains one of the Disruptor rifles which the Crimson Fox was transporting. It seems the Crime Lord had at least partially unloaded the weapons.

Vor'en puts on his gear and stows he blaster carbine. Picking up the one he had just assembled. "I think I will try this out on some bad guys. This weapon seems to be farmiliar but I can't place it." He puts a blaster pack in the weapon and primes it to fire. Looking at the disputor that they found. "I guess they got your ship close by. That is our ticket out of here then." Look over at Sarn you can us in something like this again I will be the one putting the blaster blot in you got me?"
"So I guess we should kill us a crime lord be on our way." Vor'en looks around the room and then heads over to the turbo lift. So if this goes to the landing bay then that one must got to the guy we need. Not that I want to sneak back through there though."

As they rummage through the equipment, Nemesis picks up a blaster pistol and places it on his belt.

Stocking up on a few grenades, he picks up the blaster rifle and checks its power charge.

It was different that what he was used to, but his life had taught him to make do with what he had on hand.

The journey through the barracks is tense and seems to take much too long, but you soon make it back into the corridor. The Turbolift opens after a few seconds and the inside is plated with a burnished metal. A series of buttons are line up near the door, labeled with small tags.

Vor'en looks at the two doors. It wouldbe nice to keep the door with the the Warlords backup closed so they could kill him and get away. But they could just jam the door for the Thorn Room just as easily. He reads himself for what he was about to do bring his weapon up to the ready position, and motions to his friend to open the door.

The lift door closes after a few moments and the lift begins it's ascent. Only a few tense seconds later the door opens again, revealing the lavish throne room of a crimelord. The walls are adorned with exotic paintings and artwork, and the floor is covered with a deep purple rug. Through the skylights above you see it's night, which may explain why the room isn't so guarded. The Chagrian Crime Lord sits in his large throne though, flanked by two gruff looking guards.

Relaxing his grip on the rifle a bit - but not too much that he couldn´t fire at a seconds notice - Nemesis walked slowly forward into the throne chamber, looking around to try and spot any hidden threats. From the outside of his helmet though, it probably looked as he was just arrogantly striding forward, an appearance he decided to try and maintain at least a bit longer.

Moving somewhat closer to the chagrian, Nemesis halts at a reasonable distance away. He would show a more confident appearance if he removed his helmet so the other could see his smile, but he wasn´t going to show his old "friend" who was under he helmet just yet.
"I assume you are speaking for my companion here, because as far as I am concerned, no one has "kept" me alive. Getting imprisoned just seemed like the fastest way to get inside. And I am glad that you are not unfamiliar with death in business, because I think I owe you one"
