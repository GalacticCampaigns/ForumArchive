# [Void Stalkers] Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Frost** (2010-06-22 17:12:38)

The Void-stalkers have had a short but eventful career so far. Their first mission was the rescue of Mon Mothma from ISB agents sent to detain her on Corascaunt. After a hair raising speeding blaster fight through the congested airways of the Imperial capital they managed to escape with the leader of the fledgling rebellion. Stealing her away from the heart of Palpatine's Empire. They quickly began pirating Imperial convoys for much needed supplies and equipment. During the final part of these lightning raids they were ambushed by an Imperial dreadnught *Slaughter* that had moved an asteroid into their hyperspace corridor pulling them out of hyperspace and frying the nav computer. They had an intense dog fight with the newest imperial fighters. They managed to escape but not with out serious damage to the ship and crew. Jake Golan was seriously injured losing his right leg and left forearm. They were replaced by cybernetics and he was back on active duty soon. Lt Zim didn't fair so well his injuries healed but he remains in a coma. Using some much needed downtime the squadron headed to the Smugglers Moon for a few quasi-legal upgrades including combat thrusters and some improved shields. They soon returned to the fight by freeing a group of Wookie slaves from Trandosian slavers. The information retrieved from the ship of the slavers revealed that a large group of Wookie slaves had been taken to Bandomeer to work in the imperial mines there. They used the slavers ships clearances to bypass the Imperial security and were doing a fly by of the mine before deciding how to proceed. The mission objective was to rescue as many slaves and supplies as possible.

Standing in the cockpit while the pilots were doing their flying...thing with the turning and the rolling and things that made her stomach twitch was probably not the best idea. It was why Arty was clutched for dear life on Antur's chair, using the other to help stabilize herself.
Dressed in black, tight pants and shirt to better blend to the shadows when they touched down she had to think again on her question to the pair, would this outfit have been better if it were in white? Snowy world...white clothes would be better...did she have white?
Getting her black boot covered feet under her the human fluffs her hair, the shades of blue, blond, and pink flying every which way as the hand leaves "Land us safely if you please Antur." She remarks with a grin, she knew he would, trusted him that much.

Biardi glances around nervously at the sensors and out the transparisteel viewport. He’s still not sure why they don’t just land the ship, but orders are orders. Trying to think of a mechanical failure that could possibly explain their sudden departure from the provided flight plan the duros begins racking his brain. It would be a shame for them to get blown out of the sky *after* being cleared through the automated defenses.

### **Frost** (2010-06-22 18:36:36)

Biardi is going over the sensors when he notices that the mining station is transmitting a signal. The signal is an automated landing beacon.

### **Yogi** (2010-06-22 18:39:14)

At the controls Jake sits there with his hands on the throttle ready to push it to the stops. A fly by was their last idea.
**"We still doing the fly by boss?"**
He was ready for whatever came down. Fly-by or putting down. Either way it was going to be a ride.

### **master_Tru** (2010-06-22 18:48:22)

Antur looks at Jake and pats him on the back "Ok Jake buzz the tower, lets give them hell then run like hell. The Void Stalkers are here!" Opening the ships internal com Antur boasts "Ok fellow travelers time to fasten your safety belts we may experience some slight weapons fire followed by oh god oh god I`m going to die. Thank you for flying rebel one, time to get to work."
Antur squeezes Arty`s hand gently "Landings we can do, and most of them in one piece. Don`t worry I still owe you a dinner and I am a man of my word." Smiling Antur almost forgets the recent promotion to lead Void Stalker, skipper Captain or whatever rank the rebellion decided to give him. Antur shakes his head and looks around at the crew then back to the view port. In a low voice Antur states as much to himself as to the others "This one is for you Jax."

“Picking up an automated landing beacon on the scopes Captain,” Biardi says in a steady voice. “It looks like that’s where we need to go but if you still want to do the flyby I guess we can say we’re having issues with the plasma cooling relays so the gyro stabilizer's primary motivator is malfunctioning.”

---

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **master_Tru** (2010-06-22 19:10:59)

Antur raises his hand in the air, then sighs as if that was suppose to mean something. "Hold up Jake." Looking to Biardi Antur nods "Biardi work with Jake and follow the landing beacons automated instructions. We might not have to blast our way in" Antur completes the rest of his sentence in a lower voice "only blast our way out."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-22 19:27:34)

Having followed the conversation over the comm, Jordan figured that people had decided to try and get the ship down, and not begin shooting just yet. Satisfied with the decision, he got up from his chair in the gun turret and started to head towards the main areas of the *Voidstalker*. As he passed it, he picked up the rifle leaning to the wall at his station. He stroked the barrel of the gun with one hand, happy to feel that he had indeed got rid of all the Trandoshan guts he got all over it in the last mission.
Coming up on the cockpit, he decided to just poke his head in, since there were a few people inside.
**"So, we´re gonna blow them up from the inside instead of the outside? Good call if you ask me. Are we going to be expecting trouble settling down?"**

### **ganthet** (2010-06-22 20:49:59)

From his station in the Engine room, Deel hangs on to whatever he can to keep from being thrown around like a rag doll. Over the comms. "You know I really need to get a chair back here to strap myself into. Or take away the combat thrusters I put in. Could you guys ciut back on the fancy flying. Your killing my back here." Deel keeps checking readouts and keeping the ships systems running. "Ready when you guys are."

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Frost** (2010-06-22 21:23:44)

Biadri lets the automated land procedure take over and the ship begins a slow gentle glide onto a large landing pad built above the snow. You receive no communication from the mining facility and there is no one outside to meet you when you land. The facility has power but you see no real signs of life outside but then again its around -30 degrees outside so who in their right minds would be.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **ganthet** (2010-06-22 22:10:00)

"well that is more like it guys." Deel says over the comms as the ship glides to a stop. He checks over the read out in front of him. "Have systems check for you in minute Captain. Shall I shut her down or keep the engine running for ya?"

Biardi glances back at Jordan from the copilot’s chair, chuckling lightly at his comment. “Doesn’t look like anyone’s here to greet us but who knows. Let me see what I can detect on the scanners.”
Hunching over the boards his dexterous fingers fly over the various buttons and diodes as he scans for any life forms in the area.
At Deel’s complaints Biardi smirks in amusement. “Disable those combat thrusters and it won’t be our flying that kills you but the Imps’ lasers,” he jokes good naturedly.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Frost** (2010-06-23 00:54:55)

The scanners are showing power fluctuation through out the small compound. There are four buildings near the landing pad. They are all prefabricated building typical of Imperial design. There is a command/communications module, a barracks/living area module, a mechanics bay/garage, and a large block building with a large blast door. The blast door is partly open. There is an obvious roadway through the the snow that leads to a large storage area and the entrance to the mine. Bandomeer lacks a moon so there is no real natural light so the area is lit by large floodlights.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **master_Tru** (2010-06-23 07:20:49)

Antur looks around the cockpit "Ok boys complete the post flight check then meet me by the landing ramp." Standing Antur heads for the ramp "Time to suit up ... looks cold out there. After you Arty." Antur bows slightly motioning towards the hatch.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **zerah** (2010-06-23 10:55:40)

Arty grins at the pilot as she makes her way towards the ramp and the environmental suits. Yup, white would have been better, hell she could have worn purple and it wouldn't have mattered with that suit.
"So much for trying to go in style." She calls over her shoulder with a wink as she begins to suit up, setting the goggles over her eyes she looks over to the others as she drops into a crouch and slips along the walls, testing her movements and the noise this might make while she was sneaking about.
"We ready?" she asks as she returns to the group.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-23 11:22:05)

Jordan reluctantly pulls on the environmental suit, wishing instead that he had a proper suit of *beskar* to protect him. Having made that realization one too many time during their missions, he decided that once they were done on this ice ball, he would take a short trip - with or without permission - to Kamino.
For now though, he had to settle with what they had. After getting the suit in place, he checked the side holster holding his pistol. He then pulled the weapon sling over his shoulder, and clicked the rifle in place in it. Moving the weapon to hang by his side, he walked over to the ramp, watching Arty for a moment.
**"Ready. You don´t think they mind if we come in armed, do you?"**

---

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Yogi** (2010-06-23 12:10:42)

Jake finished the post flight check list as quickly as possible then left the pilots chair and headed back to the others.
As he geared up he looked at the others. **"I hate cold weather."** He grabbed his weapons and secured them to his body and finally took up his blaster rifle.
He smiled at Jordans remark. **"Doesn't matter if they do. We're not going to give 'em a choice."**
Pulling down the goggles and bringing up the protective covering that covered the lower half of his face he nodded at Antur. **"Ready to go boss."**

---

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **zerah** (2010-06-23 12:56:54)

Arty stands and moves to the others, setting the protective under mask up and securing it with her goggles. At least if they were going to the cold they were somewhat warm and smart with suits....unlike the last time, this suit was far more comfortable and easier to move in...and she wouldn't be called names and laughed at.
Wasn't her fault the layers of clothes had made it hard to move...fools.
....Where were they going? oh right!
Snapping back to the present the human looks about, moving to the side of the ramp after checking for her blaster, be more useful if it was *outside* the suit. Moving it quickly and redressing she was positive she was ready for some shadow stalking. "Ready to move Captain." she says with a focused look, no more time for flirting, they had work to do.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Valheru** (2010-06-23 13:02:53)

Biardi helps with the post flight check before making his way back to the landing ramp.
He quickly suites up and grabs his blaster rifle, slinging it over his shoulder. The duros nods at the others to let them know he’s ready to go. Behind the face covering Biardi grins at Jake's bravado but adds, “Well if possible we might want to avoid a firefight until we get inside. If these suites get damaged we’ll get more acquainted with the cold then I’d like.”

---

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **ganthet** (2010-06-23 13:11:44)

Deel finishes his checks and heads to the ramp to meet the others. "Everything is green Boss." Pulling on his envirosuit. "You know living in the dessert is going to make this not a lot of fun for me." Checking his suit and making sure his blaster, tools, and whatever else he might need was in easy reach. "We got a portable scanner for this. Would be nice to see what is a head of us before it starts shooting blaster bolts at us."

---

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-23 18:46:02)

Jordan laughs a bit at Jake´s comment.
**"Yeah, we really should be persuasive about them letting us into the heat"**
Digging a bit through his equipment belt, he picks up an explosive charge and looks at it before replacing it in the pocket.
**"Should we need to, I can probably create our own entrance…do you want me to knock first, Captain?"**

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Frost** (2010-06-23 21:53:50)

You assemble at the boarding ramps and wait while it lowers with a clang. The stillness of the ice and the dark make that clang echo across the night. The frigid air hits you and you shiver through your protective gear. You breath in the night air and it has an odd metallic after taste to it. There are steps down from the pad to the ice path. You a few options from here to your left is the command/communication module it is the closet building to the pad. The next closet build set slightly behind and to the right is the mechanics bay/garage. To the right is the barracks and set farther back behind the barracks closer to the actual mine is the square building with the open blast doors.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Valheru** (2010-06-23 22:56:14)

Biardi steps lightly down the ramp, rifle still at his shoulder to avoid suspicion just in case someone’s watching them. He scans the area, on the lookout for any signs of movement while also studying the possible directions the group could go in. Without taking his large red eyes of the landscape Biardi addresses Antur, “Which way would you like to go Captain? I guess they expect us to know what we’re doing because they haven’t offered any other instructions or a welcoming committee.”
After a moments thought he adds, “Might I suggest the command module? Maybe we can knock out their comms and prevent them from calling for reinforcements.”

Antur pauses looking around at the buildings and into the snowy waste. Pointing to command building Antur orders "That building there with all the communication array looks like central command for this place. We should start there, cut off their communications." Antur nods to Jake, then smiles at Arty. "Jake you take point, Arty rear. Not sure if you can sneak around much out here but from the rear position you should have the best shoot."
Antur zips up his cold gear and steps onto the ramp "Remember we are Void-stalkers, we are the best!. Lets go." Checking his weapons everything is in order, Antur watches to see his orders unfold then falls in behind Jake.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Yogi** (2010-06-24 08:14:32)

Jake heard the orders as he surveyed the area. **"Roger that Boss, command tower it is."** Double checking his blaster rifle one last time he moved out across the cold terrain to the communication building. ***Take out the head and the body should be easier to deal with.***
So far so good as there was no one around. But Jake was experienced enough to know that the poodoo could hit the turbofan at any time.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **zerah** (2010-06-24 11:03:09)

Arty nods her head to the orders, rear was fine with her, gave her more places to look over and less of people in her way should things get hairy. Stepping off onto the ramp she waits for the others to form the filing lines before taking her point at the rear.
Removing her blaster, she holds it to the ready, keeping her eyes peeled for any movements out in the snow. Sneaking was going to be hard but maybe she could try to blend a little. She crouches slightly behind the group, still moving but doing her best to be a small target that's more easily able to be mistaken for something else.

Deel grabs the Portable scanner and follows his team mates out. Switching on the scanner he begins figuring out what is around them. "So are we going to disable or level the place. Cause I could throw a big hydro spanner in there works with out all of fireworks. We can always set it up to blow if they to repair it." Looking at the scanner. "Ok lets see who or what is around."

**"We don´t have to blow the whole thing up, but we should try to put it out of commission as much as we can, at least until we clear the place of bad guys"**
Jordan fell in step behind Jake, holding his rifle with both hand while looking around the place. He hoped there wouldn´t be any shooting outside, since they were pretty much in the open, but he would be ready in any case.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Frost** (2010-06-24 12:49:13)

You carefully make your way down the non slick stairs to the compacted snow. The snow pact is very slippery but you carefully make your way across towards the command center. None of you see any signs of life or hear anything. The scanner isn't picking anything up either. No signs of life and no movement detected. You reach the entry hatch to the command module.
*[ooc: Snow counts as difficult terrain. You can choose to move at normal speed but run risk of slipping]*

---

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Valheru** (2010-06-24 13:16:48)

Biardi follows along in formation, silent and alert. As they reach the entry hatch he breaks rank and moves to one side of the door to “stack” it. While he could certainly check the door he knows his teammates well enough by now to realize one of them would be better suited to find any Imperial surprises or hack through any existing security.
The duros grips his blaster rifle tight to his chest, anticipation welling up. While he’s experienced plenty of ground combat Biardi still feels out of place when not sitting in a pilot’s chair. That might seem strange to many humans but for a duros it was rather common.
Clamping down on his anxiety, Biardi is determined that none of it show through. He’s ready to spring into action if the Imps react with hostility.

"This place is kind of dead Boss." Deel says looking up from the scanner. He also tries very hard not to slip on the ice and snow. "You this would have been easier if we had a replusor sled or speeder. I am having a wonderful time walking around here." Deel didn't mean to complain but he was not used to snow or ice. Sand he could deal with, space, on a ship no problem. this place put him out of his elimate.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-24 15:22:19)

**"Speeders are easier to spot…"**
Jordan drops his rifle down to his side, allowing it to hand in its sling as he moves closer to examine the hatch. He knew a thing or two about getting into places unseen, and unless they had some maximum security, or some fancy computerized lock, he should be able to get it open.
He pulled off the gloves of his suit and took out his security kit and looked at the lock before getting to work. He would try to do his thing as discreet as possible, in case a patrol would come by outside and check on the door.
((Taking 10 for Mechanics 25 to disable the lock, adding +5 to the DC to leave no trace behind))

### **ganthet** (2010-06-24 15:30:36)

"I know Jordan." Deel says with a sigh. He turns to see he what he was doing. "You got that? I could give it try." Deel didn't doubt his friends abilitys. He was just used to being the one that dealt with mechanical stuff.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Frost** (2010-06-24 15:50:10)

The door slides open as you quickly manipulate the locks internal elements. The room is a very basic Imperial set up. Most of the building is taken up by the large communications array and computer system in its center. Sparks fly from the computers and broken monitors smoke slightly filling the air with a mix between the ozone and blood. The lights flicker off and on haphazardly and you realize that there is blood all over the floors, wall, ceilings, and instruments. There is a door off to the left marked commander and another door marked refresher. The door on the right hand wall is open to a hallway you assume leads to the garage section of the compound. A blood smear leads through the open door and down the hallway.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **master_Tru** (2010-06-24 16:05:30)

Antur motions for all to be silent. Gesturing to Jake then to the door marked commander directing Jake to that door. Antur then motions to the door on the right hand wall then to Deel. Motioning to Arty then to the others Antur holds his fist up then points to the ground indicating for her to cover the group from inside the main door way.
Antur nods to Jordan to follow before heading towards the blood smear leads through the open door and down the hallway.
Mving as silently as he can muster Antur pulls out his blaster pistol. Looking around at the mess he sets it to kill.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Yogi** (2010-06-24 16:48:30)

Jake too k in the scene from inside the communication building. What had happened in here was gruesome to say the least. On the plus side there was no Imperial welcoming committee. He took it slow so he didn't slip in the blood. Looking back at Antur he got the sign to move to the commanders door. Giving a nod in acknowledgment he moved to the door.
He waited a few seconds till everyone was in place then reached out with his left hand and quickly pushed the door in and began to sweep the room.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-24 16:50:57)

Jordan was going to give some reply to Deel about that there were three things he could do with anything mechanic: Keep it in working shape, make it stop work, and make it go boom. However, the sight that greeted them inside the hatch made another part of his brain snap to, and he remained silent, and immediately more focused.
Carefully replacing the tools used at the door in his belt, he grabbed hold of his rifle again and raised it up high. At second thought though, he switches the grip on the weapon, grabbing hold of the stock of the grenade attachment. The weapon was loaded with a stun charge, followed by a deadly one, a combination that would allow him to open fire without risk for possible friendlies, and still switch to a deadly charge if no hostiles should be present.
Rifle pointed at the door, he kept close to the opposite side of the hallway as Antur, and followed silently.

### **zerah** (2010-06-24 17:01:00)

Snow....how she hated it...it was good as ice and in drinks, even good to munch on, but when it was under foot it was the bane of her existence, it was cold and squishy...stupid snow. She followed the others, taking careful steps to not slip and fall, she still slipped but falling at least didn't happen. At the door, she kept her back to the group and off to the side of the door to watch for any movement outside..until the door opened.
Arty winces at the stench of blood and ozone, the blood that litered the floor and the prints upon the far wall were not what she had been expecting. The hell had happened? mutiny or something worse?
Her hands hold tight to her blaster as she sinks back into a shadowed wall, crouching down in her position as Antur had instructed. She only had to wait now, wait and keep her eyes and ears open for anything to happen. She hoped nothing would, maybe there had been a mutiny but of the slaves instead of the imperials...if that was the case and they had the place locked down to their own will...they wouldn't take kindly to them without knowing they were a rescue of sorts..
This was one of those delicate situations where she was fairly certain Jax would send her to investigate ahead of the team and report back findings, she hoped they would send her, she may not want to be in the line of fire, but she knew she could get in and out with little trouble. For now though she watched the others backs, guarding the main room and entrance.

Biardi’s red eyes widen in shock at the scene displayed before them. He’s seen the carnage of war first hand before but this is taking it to a whole new level. He stares at the rooms contents wondering what could possibly have caused this. Maybe a rampaging wookie?
Remaining silent the duros recovers quickly and readies his blaster rifle. Biardi moves into the position indicated as quietly as he can. When nothing jumps out of the hallway just yet he aims his rifle at the door and waits for Jake to open it.

Deel goes cold at the sight of what greets him on other side of the door. He didn't need the order to be quite to tell him it was time to go to work. He puts away the scanner and takes out his blaster ready to enter and clear the room. He slowly moves to the door Antur had told him to cover. He tries to open the door remembering the last time he had stepped into it and damn neared died. He keeps his blaster ready and enters to clear the room.

Jake quickly and quietly opens the commander's door. The room is a small office with an large desk with built in data terminal and a high back black office chair. There is a small shelving unit with various pictures of a family and data cards. The lights are off and the room is lit by the glow of the terminal. The room seems to be empty but Jake has that tickle at the back of neck but it may just be nerves.
Deel clears the freshers and besides a foul odor detects nothing dangerous.

### **Valheru** (2010-06-25 23:26:17)

Biardi remains still, with his blaster rifle held at the ready, as the door to the Commander's office slides open. He'd almost expected something to burst forth and should be relieved that it hasn't. Instead it feels like the tension has only risen. The duros peers into the room as best he can from his position, covering his teammate until Jake gives the 'all clear'.

Looking over to Arty Antur cannot help but to feel anger if anything was to happen to her. Shaking his head Antur reminds himself, we have a job to do we all know the risks. Yea that will make things all better, right. Speaking quietly Antur calls out to Arty "See if those computers have any information on them."

After opening the door Jake looked around the room that was only lit up by the terminal. He moved as if he was about to enter the room but stopped. Something wasn't right. It wasn't anything substantial just a gut feeling. He looked behind him to the others.
**"Get me some light in this room. Glowrod, anything just don't go inside yet."** He wasn't sure what it was but something bothered him.

At Jake's request for light Biardi reaches into his utility belt and retrieves a glow rod. Activating it he extends the glow rod out in front of him while keeping his other hand on the blaster rifle.
Biardi approaches the room but doesn't enter it, coming to a halt beside Jake. The duros slowly sweeps his glow rod around, letting its light illuminate the office.

The light scans the room back and forth then Jake spots a boot barely sticking out from behind the desk. Judging from the position of the boot you think someone might be lying behind the desk.

Deel close the door to the fresher. If anything was alive in there they where going to smell it coming. He moves down the wall motioning to Antur that room was clear. Thinking to himself. *"Looks like a pack of Kath hounds where set loose in here."* The blood and death in the room was unlike anything Deel had seen before. Sure he had seen death in combat, but nothing like this. He looks around the room and behind to make sure that there was no danger.

Jordan let the others do what they were doing, and kept his eyes focused on the open door leading into a hallway with a nice shiny blood trail in it. Creeping forward, rifle raised, he moved towards the left corner of the hallway, deciding to take a post there for the time being to cover the hallway while the others finished examining the other rooms.

Arty looks over to the sound of of Antur's voice "See if those computers have any information on them." Nodding her head, she moves slowly, checking her spot for covering the others by the main gate.
Locating the computers she begins attempting to turn the thing on and see if power was running to it. Computers...she didn't care for them much, she preferred ships and droids to sitting down with a computer, they were a bit rude in her opinion. Still...she had to try something, and how hard could it be?

Jordan and Artur move to cover the hallway, while Deel examines the room. Deel sees a lot of damage done to the main computer core and communication systems he is surprised they are even working.

Noticing the boot Jake motions to the others that there is one occupant and that he moving in. Keeping his rifle trained in the body he cautiously moves into the room. With the light that Biardi is providing it has made it easier for him to see the occupant. If there is any movement Jake would have the upper hand with his weapon trained on the body.

Biardi nods to Jake in response. Moving slowly, both to keep the light steady and to keep his footfalls quiet, the duros advances into the room behind Jake. His blaster rifle is still held at the ready in case of hostiles.
((Perception +10, Stealth +7, obviously he's pretty visible but still trying to be quiet. Also, I'm assuming Biardi collapsed the stock on his blaster rifle when he drew the glow rod, if not he'll do so now.))

The damage to the computers is extensive and would require a lot of times and spare parts. Deel spends a few minutes jury-rigging it and you make it so that info could be downloaded.
Jake and Biardi sweep around the desk rifles trained on the body. They find an Imperial officer with his face a mess of blood and bone. An imperial blaster pistol lies next to the body.
Jordan and Antur thinks they hear movement down around the corner. Kind of a click click drag sound. It is moving slowly closer.

Biardi takes the ghastly appearance of the corpse in stride. He'd expected to find a body and after all the gore outside it would take a lot more than this to make him squeamish.
Biardi slings his blaster rifle over his shoulder. They don't appear to be in any immediate danger and he could use a free hand. Holding the glow rod above his head so that both he and Jake can see what they're doing Biardi crouches over the Imperial's body. He studies the man's injuries trying to determine their origin even though he lacks medical training. Then pats the body down searching for any code cylinders or comlinks the officer might have had.

Upon hearing sounds further down the hallway, Jordan slowly slid down against the wall into a kneeling position and placed his finger on the trigger to the grenade attachment. He had no idea of knowing what was moving down the hallway, but he figured the odds it wasn´t friendly to be pretty low. Besides, a stun charge would not cause any permanent damage.

Antur hears the clicking sound and judging by Jordan's movements he heard it as well. Unable to see the source of the sound Antur holds his blaster close and ready. Whispering to Jordan "Hold, wait for the shoot." Antur wonders what the others may have found by now. And now the clicking sound, what in the stars happened here? No the stars had nothing to do with this hell. *Click …. scrap … click …. scrap ….*

"Let's see....Communications.....what can you show me.." She brings up the files for it to see just what she can do...and how better to cripple whoever's still alive of the enemy.

Specking softly. "I can get it if you want me to Arty. Did some repairs to the core and we should be able to download it if needed." When she moves away from the terminal Deel takes over and sees what he can find in the system.

Jake and Biardi do a quick search of the commander's office. Biardi finds a code cylinder and a commlink as well as a spare energy pack. The blaster is standard issue office side arm the ammo counter says only one shot was fired. Jake takes a look at the terminal the words on the screen read

He rifles through the desk and finds a half drunken bottle of McCutchin's Correllion whisky. That stuff is pretty expensive, 100 credits a shot kind of expensive. He finds several flimsies of mining data and expense reports. In the middle desk drawer is a several small red gemstones.
Deel moves over next to Arty and starts playing with the computer core. He pulls up the communication files and sees most of the comms records have been deleted. Out of the ones that remain there are about 3 between the base and the mine and one to corascaunt and then an incoming message from ISD *Interrigator*
The click..click...drag noise is getting closer. The clicking sounds like boot heels on the floor as they get closer. Around the corner come a man wrapped up head to toe in cold weather gear and he is dragging a rifle behind him, he staggers a bit as he tries to make the turn. He drops to one knee looking like he is about to fall over.

Antur looks to Jordan then back to the unidentified man. "Cover me!" Antur runs to the mans side, blaster still in hand. "Are ... you ... OK? Can ... you ... hear me? What happened here. How can I help you?" Antur looks the man over checking for anything out of place, and to see if he or she is an imperial. One eye remains on the rifle, this is still a possible threat.

Jordan gets up pretty much as soon as Antur starts moving. The Mandalorian soldier proceeds forward more slowly than Antur, holding his rifle raised and trained towards the end of the hallway. When he gets closer to the corner, he slows down even further, poking his head out to check the hallway before assuming a crouching stance at the corner.

Glancing at the bottle of whiskey the duros adds, "Ah well, at least we'll have something to toast with afterwards."

That's...a bit weird..." She points to the screen and the message "what's this then? Is it fresh or old?" She looks up as movement catches her attention, where were Antur and Jordan going?

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Frost** (2010-06-28 16:58:48)

The man in the hallway collapses in a heap the rifle drops from his hand. Antur rolls the man over to check his vitals. The man is a Caucasian human male you estimate in his late twenties. He looks like he has been exposed to extreme cold his lips are blue and his breathe is shallow. Jordan moves to the corridor and covers down the hallway. The hallway ends in a open doorway Jordan sees something moving in there but there is no light in the room so he can't be sure what it was he saw.
Deel quickly downloads the comms traffic and the personnel files to his data pad. the system seems to damaged to gather anything more with out some serious time and effort. the comms between the min and the base are the oldest according to the date stamp about four weeks ago. The message to Corascaunt is about 10 days old. The message from ISD *Interrigator* is only five days old.
Biardi finds that the terminal is just a remote access to the main core so there isn't much there, how ever he does find a personal log of the commanders but it is encrypted with password protection.

"The call to Corascaunt is about 10 days old, the call to ISD Interrigator is only five days old. So either that is them checking in or we might have company sometime."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-28 18:16:45)

Jordan barely gets down in a crouch before he spots something moving inside the open door at the end of the hallway. Aborting his stance, he gets to his feet again.
**"Heads up Antur, we´ve got movement down the hall. I didn´t spot more than one someone, but I´ll take a closer look"**
As he started moving down the hallway, Jordan let go off his rifle, leaving it to hang behind his right shoulder in the sling. The dark room ahead was no place for heavy weaponry like that, since he had no idea what he would be hitting. Instead he drew out his sidearm blaster in one hand, and in the other hand he placed the stun grenade he hadn´t been able to fit into the launcher.
With the pistol raised, and his grenade hand behind him ready for a throw, he carefully approached the room, prepared to execute a room breach.
((If I can get within 2 squares of the room unmolested, I´ll lob the grenade in, dodge to the side of the doorway, produce a glow rod, and then go in and sweep with the glow rod and pistol raised))

Biardi plugs the scomp link into a data port and a few seconds later the personal log of Commander H. Vilaro opens up.
There is only one file it's dated for today. The Commander's face looms into the camera so all you see is his face. You can hear the clicking of keys as he starts talking.
*"We should have left it alone. The ghosts will come soon but they won't take me, I figured out a way to beat them. Damn the Emperor damn Tremayne. Why couldn't they have left the ship alone. I told them there was darkness yes much darkness there but did they listen oh no. Dig it out they said. Once we opened it the Ghosts appeared and the wooks started to change. They went mad madder than me hahahaha but still mad. I found away off this hellish ice cap though and it doesn't even need to wait till the Inquisitor gets here."*
He holds a blaster up to the camera
*"This is the key to oblivion my escape they won't warp me the way they warped the rest. I'm sorry but if your watching this then it might be your key as well."*
He puts the blaster in his mouth and pulls the trigger. His face explodes as his body falls out of the chair. The video continues to run for several more seconds and Biardi thinks he sees something moving in the darkness behind the chair. Its like a black mass of shadow in a dark room. Then the camera shuts off on its own.He isn't even sure he saw it, it could be a trick of his eyes and the tension causing his mind to run wild.

Biardi can't help but wince at the graphic display before him. With a shudder he closes the file and withdraws the code cylinder. No telling what other uses it might have in this facility. The duros glances at Jake. **"I think I've seen more than I needed to,"** he says solemnly.
Biardi stands up and makes his way towards Deel and Arty at the terminal. His face shows his disquiet but his voice remains calm. He offers the officer's comlink to Deel, **"Here, maybe you can pull off the Imps comm codes or encryption from this thing."** After a grim pause he adds, **"If there's anyone left to make a call in this hellhole."**

### **Yogi** (2010-06-29 01:03:18)

The computer screen was weird. 'I'm sorry' was written all across it. Moving on to the rest of the desk Jake searched it top to bottom. He came away with a few interesting things. A wonderful half bottle of expensive Corellian whisky, several flimsies three gemstones. Grabbing everything he could he tucked it all into a oversized pocket on his cold weather gear. They could go trough it all later.
He looked over at the screen as Bardi played the officers last log. It confirmed it. The guy was off his rocker. Still it left a chill that creeped down his spine. **"Something isn't right here."** he motioned to outside the office as he grabbed the bottle. At least they could enjoy a little something on the way back from this forsaken place. He stepped out of the office.

Arty takes the data pad, pulling up the messages she could to see just what was going on, she supposed the best one would be from the mine, might as well go in order and see if there were any timelines.
Glancing up briefly as she waited to look over to the two others that joined them she nods her head "Hopefully we can find out some information about the mine or the personnel files." She glances over to Jake she raises a brow at the bottle in his hand "I see you found something." She says with a smirk, she couldn't help it, she didn't like tense situations, and this place was creepy.
Nodding her head towards the inner door she looks to the two others "Antur and Jordan went that way, might want to see if you can help them with whatever it is they're doing."

### **Frost** (2010-06-29 13:21:05)

Arty pulls the messages from the mine. They are a grainly low quality video. you see a large ice cave with several Wookies kneeling down with their hands on their heads you see several snow troopers aiming blasters at the wooks. The camera moves past the wooks and towards one of the walls. You can see a large dark shape looming in the ice. The camera pans back and forth giving you a rough idea of its size. It's large you have a feeling you can only see a fraction of what ever it is.
*"Commander this is what the carpets founds sir. What do you want us to do?"*
The voice comes from off camera
Commander Vilaro's voice
*"Have them clear away as much ice as possible Gor-tel. This could be a major find. Keep me updated."*
Gor-tel: *"Are you sure sir? I have a bad feeling about this."*
Vilaro: *"Do what I ordered Gor-tel or your next mining job will be on Kessel!"*
Gor-tel: *"Yes sir."*
The next message is voice only
Gor-tel: *"Commander we have cleared away a large amount of ice and have determined it to be some sort of ancient space craft. We have located an access point."*
Vilaro: *"Excellent I am on my way down, don't open it till I get there."*
Gor-tel: *"Open it sir? What if it isn't safe?"*
Vilaro: *"Coward isn't that what we have the wooks for? I will be there soon."*
The message to Corascaunt is a text only message that apparently had a large file attached. The message seems to be a report directly to someone at the Imperial palace. It is long and technical but basically describes a large ship about the size of a small transport. It seems to be pre hyperdrive as it is only equipped with sub light engines. There were apparently carbonite chambers with living being inside. The beings appeared to be human or near human. Four of the five life signs have failed and upon un-freezing the bodies just dissipated into nothing. The last on seemed to still being showing normal life signs. They had not un frozen the last one. The had also requested re-enforcements as the wookie population was starting to act up.
The last message is from the ISD *"Interrogator"*
![Tremayne-DSSB.jpg](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20050811202746/starwars/images/4/4d/Tremayne-DSSB.jpg)
*"The emperor has sent us to reclaim the ship and its cargo. Elimate the slave work force.Then stand by for our arrival. Once the ship has been retrieved you will be evaced and promoted and given the duty station of your choice. Tremayne out."*
Deel has no luck with the scomp link. The encryption code doesn't match the one on the personnel files. This will require some old fashion slicing.
As Jordan moves down the hall and Antur moves to cover him. Jordan thinks he can make out something in the vehicle repair bay. It looks like several bodies are hung from the ceiling by chains. The bodies sway slightly which may or may not have been the movement you saw earlier. The bodies are all appear to be in what remains of snowtrooper armor but they look like they have been torn apart and only the carcasses have been strung up to drain.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **zerah** (2010-06-29 13:45:18)

Arty watches the messages with a growing sense of fascination and horror, what was it that could have been in the ships? pre-hyperdrive??
"Guys, I found out what was going on here, the mining crew found an old ship dating back pre-hyperdrive, they found bodies frozen by the life support systems failed on four, two disintegrated when open and the last was left untouch with some vital signs....there's some weird shadows here in this message but it may be the resolution..it's hard to tell...The Interrogator though was to pick up the ship and cargo and evac the imperial crew to promote them and give a station of their choosing.."
She looks up to the others and frowns "Whatever it was that was found, the wookiees didn't seem to like it too much, they had requested for reinforcements to help them control them.
Looking back over the messages she shakes her head "It's possible the humanoid in the ship woke up...maybe it didn't know where it was and took the wookiees as gentle and the imperials as hostile..we should really try to find them and make sure they're all okay."
Stowing the datapad in a pocket she looks to the others, "if there's nothing else here we should move and help the others."

*What the…? Well, better safe than sorry…*
Though it appears to be more things dead than alive inside the room, Jordan wasn´t willing to bet on the fact that nothing was alive in there. And judging from what he thought he could make out inside made him even less unwilling to take a chance with whatever might possibly be in there. The veteran soldier weighs the grenade in his hand for a few moments before hurling the sphere inside the room. Stepping quickly to the side, he reaches into his belt for a glow rod and waits for the detonation. Once he hears it, he proceeds quickly inside the room, sweeping across it with active glow rod and pistol raised.

"Well not going to get anything off this without some time." Deel puts the comm link away and his attention back to what Arty was looking over. "Pre-hyperdrive? What would the Empire want with that other then for a museum. It is a prize at best. Wouldn't mind getting a look it though." Deel kind smirks at the fact that he was interested in the ship just to take it apart and see how it worked. That Imperial ship coming here could be a problem though. They find us here we are dead."

Jordan's discretion may have saved his life, the stun grenade goes off and he hears a bellow from above as he dashes into the room. He dives to the right as a large hairy thing drops down right where he was just standing. Jordan shines his glow rod at the thing and he sees a hideous mutated wookie. It has red and yellow eyes, its fangs are enlarged to sharp tusks. There are bony spiked protrusions poking out from the blood matted fur. It is really large even for a wookie.

The cold dread in the pit of Biardi's stomach grows larger with each new revelation. This place is really starting to creep him out but he reminds himself that he's a soldier and they have a mission to do.
**"You're right Arty. I hope the wookies are alright but I've got a bad feeling about this."**
At Deel's comment Biardi nods dismally, **"Who knows how long it'll take them to get here but we should hurry all the same."**
Biardi turns off the glow rod, so as not to broadcast his position, but keeps it in his hand in case they need it again. He grabs his blaster rifle again and starts to head down the hallway when the unmistakable sound of a grenade detonating reaches his ears. The duros takes off at a run to join Jordan and Antur.

Arty's head snapped up at the bellow that reverbrated through the room from the hallway "the hell..." she mumbles. Grabbing her blaster she takes off for the hallway Antur and Jordan had left down.
Thank the stars for the darkness but the light ahead must have been from a glowrod if the color was anything to go by "Antur! Jordan! what was that!" She calls out, moving forward with her blaster at the ready. She was alert, if something had attacked or was even planning to attack she wanted to make sure that she'd see it.
Sliding to the wall she moves across slowly, using the shadows to her advantage as much as she could.

Jake had stepped out of the commanders office with Bardi as Arty and Deal were playing the transmission they were able to retrieve. They all seemed to come to the same conclusion. Staying here was a bad idea. He looks at the others. **At least the ride home will be better. I managed to find a half bottle of Corellian whisky. That should make the trip home better. Also some data cards and some gemstones were there that I managed to grab."**
He no longer finished speaking when the the sound of a grenade went off down the corridor. Bardi was quick and began runing down the hall. Jake closely followed his friend blaster rifle at the ready.

*Instincts are good, instincts keep you alive…*
Somewhere in his mind, Jordan could hear the words of a veteran back on Mandalore giving advice to young warriors. How many times had he not been proved true?
On sheer instinct, he had dropped into a roll, and he came up, pistol blazing. He actually liked Wookies, but this guy didn´t seem like he was in a mood to talk. As he one-handed discharged a couple of bolts towards the beast, he dropped the glow rod in front of him, keeping it pointed towards his opponent. He hoped to gain some small advantage in the poorly lit room by keeping the light on the Wookie and himself in the shadows.

Jordan`s grenade goes off ... that new voice will have to wait."by the stars, Arty we are ok ... for now cover the entrances." Antur follows Jordan`s actions to provide cover.

**"So, you want to have it that way? Fine"**
Dropping his pistol on the ground next to the glow rod, Jordan drops both hands to his side and pulls up his rifle, pressing down the trigger and spraying a shower of red bolts towards the Wookie.

***Combat Round 1***
Arty moves up and kneels down by entrance to the hallway near the unconscious man that Antur was attending to.
Biardi races out of the Commander's office and makes it around the hallway entrance and almost into the mechanics bay.
Antur moves down the hallway waiting for a clear shot, he sees his chance and fires. The blast hits the Wookie in the shoulder and scorches away fur and meat but the Wookie seems to ignore the would his hulking form turning toward Jordan.
*Atk Roll 24 Hit Dmg Roll 14+1-5=10*
Jordan tries to use the distraction from Antur to feed the Wookie a belly full of blaster fire but the Wookie lashes out and hits Jordan in the chest causing his burst to blow apart one of the stormtrooper bodies apart.
*Mutarded Wookies AoO Atk Roll 26 Hit! Dmg 12!
Jordan's Atk Roll 11 Miss!*
The Wookie lets out a gurgling soul wrenching howl that causes knot of fear to well up in your chests. It effects some of you more than others. He lashes out at Jordan but Jordan manages to block the huge fist with his blaster rifle. The strength of his blow is immense and your arms start to ache immediately.

Arty watches from her position near the body, at least what could be seen. This wasn't going well...and that howl...
She winces and shudders at it, what had happened to these beings to cause this? It wasn't right...and they...well...what if it was causing them pain? Shaking her head the human stands and moves quickly closer to the fighting, she just needed to get close enough to try for a shot.
Crouched and in a stable position she brings her blaster up to her sights, lining a shot up with the wookiee...can she even call it that now? The beasts head. She just had to wait for the right moment to take the shot and hope it hits.

A bone chilling howl tears through the hallway and rocks Biardi like a physical blow. Crushing despair temporarily paralyzes the duros as the horrors of this place threaten to overwhelm him.
*Snap out of it!* his minds screams. Biardi digs deep and finds the strength to shake off his terror. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath between clenched teeth. Exhaling slowly Biardi trembles slightly as the fear leaves him.
Red eyes flare open and his blaster rifle snaps into place. An uncharacteristic snarl appears on his lips as he yells **"Arty, duck!"**.

*Ouch…what do they feed you?*
Jordan reeled as the freakishly large...thing...hit him in the chest, and he was barely able to dodge its second sweep. He could hear the shouts and shots from his squadmates, though he felt a little bit too occupied to take much notice right now. He had been thrown off balance by the sweep to his chest, but now he had time to steady himself. He knew that smarter men might have taken the opportunity to put some distance between themselves and the behemoth, but in his mind, staying close to it offered a better advantage.
Plating one foot firmly behind the other, he took hold of his rifle again, and pressed the trigger again. If the Trandoshan had splattered at this close range, then what would happen to the Wookie?

Arty moves away from the man unconscious on the ground and raises her blaster up and fires of a blast at the Wookie. The blast hits the side of it's head and it howl in pain as one eye is seared shut from the blast.

Biardi recovers from the fear and pushes it down.

Antur takes another shot but this one hits the bulkhead by the door.

Jordan braces for himself for the recoil of the heavy blaster rifle. The Wookie slams another large fist down on Jordan's upper neck and back. Jordan grimaces and fights the pain as the attack opens up the midsection to the Wookie. Jordan slams the barrel into the hairy chest and holds down the trigger. To the rest of the party it looks like the Wookie engulfs Jordan then they see the back of it explode outward as a flurry of blaster fire blows out of its back. The beast lets out a wail and the shudders and falls backwards. You hear Jordan's scream of primal fury as the Wookies wail dissipates into a death gasp.

Biardi is glad to see Jordan take out the wookie, if it can still be called that, but doesn't let his guard down. The duros moves towards the room and scans for anymore hostiles. His rifle is still upraised, ready to fire.
Focusing on the room he calls out to Jordan without glancing at him.

Arty sighs in relief as the wookiee goes down, thank the stars for that.. Moving from her crouched position she makes her way forward slowly. She could see the Duros moving and could only hope by his words that he was looking after Jordan, Antur had been near by she knew he was okay...as well as the others.
"Someone check the guy in the hall!" she calls out as she moves to the fallen wookiee slowly, lightly she nudges the body with her shoe, she just wanted to make sure before she got too close, better safe than you know dead.
Kneeling beside it she looks the wookiee over, blaster in one hand, her free hand brushes at the fur around the neck, arms, face, and head, wondering if there was something to give a sign of what caused this..maybe an injection?

Arty starts feeling through the Wookies fur trying to see if she can find anything about how this happened. She locates three large holes about the size of her pinky on the base of the Wookies neck. The wounds are fresh but they smell horrible and pus and blood are caked around them.
Biardi scans the mechanics bay. The place looks like a war zone. There is blood everywhere and blaster marks on several places around the walls. Tools and equipment lie around the room like a whirlwind scattered them. He even sees a bloody wrench embedded in the wall. Not to mention the stormtrooper bodies hanging from the suspension chains.

Wrestling the now-dead thing from over him, Jordan wipes off some of the bigger chunks of whatever stuck to him. Letting his rifle hang in its sling, he moves over to pick up his glow rod and pistols and replaces them in his belt.
Wiping off some more stuff, he gets to work looking around the room.

Arty frowns, with a mix of trying to hold down anything she ate, bringing her hand back she sniffs at the strange combination, regreting it the moment she did as her eyes crossed for a moment. Wipping it on the wookie she puts her weight against it to roll it over and have a better look at the wounds.
"Guys! Come take a look at this.." she calls out looking back at the wounds, fresh but clotting...it was disgusting but she couldn't help but stare at it. What had caused it?
"Anyone have a holocamera or something? Should get a shot of this to bring back...or even a sample of it.."

Jake looked over his shoulder. **"Someone has to take the dirty jobs. I wonder who would do something like this to them?"** He said as he picked up his visual inspection of the bay area.

His head aches; the pain is dull and constant; he can still feel the cold around him, he remembers briefly where he’s at. “**Bandomeer**. Well it could be worse, I could be dead” he thinks to himself, sighing. Slowly, he starts to wiggle his fingers and move his feet. “Good. They didn’t gnaw off my limbs.” He thinks “I don’t recognize the voices. They don’t sound like Imperial troops”. He opens his eyes to see who’s talking, keeping his movements slow and even. He groans as he tries to move. The pain in his head protests loudly at the idea of any motion. He decides it’s best if he doesn’t move for a few minutes and he continues to lies still for the moment.

The duros seems in a much lighter mood, perhaps the adrenalin rush did him some good. He joins Arty at the wookie's corpse and immediately regrets it. Biardi covers the area right below his eyes, the closest duros equivalent to holding one's nose, and examines Arty's findings.
**"Wow that is foul. As to what could do this I have no idea, nor do I have anything to take a sample with."**

Life sign readings are hard to detect maybe your equipment isn't working right or being effected by the cold. Jake doesn't notice anything more than what was previously mentioned.

It’s acting as a motivator, to just get up and get far away from it as possible. He slowly rolls to one side, and takes stock of his surroundings to see who’s speaking. He musters all the strength he has and tries to speak aloud. His voice low and gravelly “**Who’s there? Crew Chief, is that you?**”

In the silence that was this large open space the words of the newly conscious being was well heard. Turning her head Arty looks over towards the hall "Antur, I think our new guest has woken up." she calls out to him. Sighing she stands from the wookiee's side, it wasn't going to do any good hoping for something to take samples with, she'd have to remember the details and hope to find something to take a sample with later.
Moving back to the hallway the human woman looks down to the man before her "No crew chief's here." She says simply, bringing her blaster up to aim. Wounded or not, he was still an Imperial.

“**If you’re pirates looking for any goods to steal, you’ll have to go farther down into the facility. Take what you want. It’s all the same to me**.”
He rolls over onto his stomach, slowly; he keeps his eyes fixed on hers and the blaster she's holding. He places his palms flat on the floor out in front of him, in a non-threatening manner.
“**I’m unarmed**.”

"Ok, this thing must be broken. It didn't pick up any life forms in here, could be the cold." Deel starts to check the scanner to see if it is set up right. Looking towards the man on the floor while working on the scanner. "So, why would the Empire want an out dated pre hyper drive starship? The Emperor want a new ride, or does he collect them?" Looking back to the scanner and making adjustments. "Boss we have a power source below us, if this thing is working. That could be what they where working on.

Duran eyes the woman for a moment and rolls his eyes slightly and sighs. His speech is slow and clear, so as not to draw any blaster on his head. “**Chatty pirates aren’t you? I don’t know what happened to the wookie. I was attacked by an imperial guard, who..**” Duran pauses has he attempts to recall the event more clearly. “**…who didn’t look right. He looked crazed, his speech didn’t make any sense. He’s like what you would see when people go mad from being in space too long.**” Duran looks down at the ground, and then looks back up at the woman. “**You’ll forgive me for not being cordial and talkative. I have a splitting headache from where he hit me with butt of his weapon. Now, are we going to talk from this position all night, or can I stand up now? I am after all unarmed and outnumbered**” Duran says turning his head slowly to look at the voices in the room.

Antur moves next to Arty and listens to the new guy`s story. Attacked by an imperial guard, might not be an imperial but the guard looked crazed better be careful here. The scene around the group is a little unreal, bodies blood and a Wookie thing. "We are not here to harm you but your well being might depend on your co-operation. We need to know what happened here and who you are." Antur scans the man looking for signs of hidden weapons.

Jordan followed the others, but hung back as they gang-interrogated the newfound imperial. Instead, he kept his eyes - and rifle - sweeping between the various corridors leading to the room they were in. He was not about to be surprised by anything, especially not another mutated Wookie.

Duran looks over at the human man now. He regards for a moment, looking him over. “**You don’t act like imperials, and I am starting to think that you aren’t pirates**.” He waits for a brief moment taking time to examine their reactions to his statement.
“**I am Duran Vassic. I used to be the security chief here for Gigadan-Krumm Heavy Industries, well before the empire took an interest in this facility. Once the empire came in “acquired” our little operation, I was told my services would no longer be needed in their current capacity.**” He sneers, his face half angry, half snide. “**They demoted me to warehouse guard. That was over three months ago and my life has been paradise ever since. I worked for 12 years to make that position. Well, anyway not too long ago, they brought in some wookie slaves to work the mine. About a week ago, the imperials here started acting strange. The imperial officers dusted off about 3 days ago. They all but abandon this operation and everyone on it. Like I said, another day in paradise.**” His voice is dripping with contempt over his current situation.

Deel looks at Arty and then back at the guy on the floor. "Ok Arty, but I am willing to bet the guy is unarmed. Could let him stand up to make it easier on him and me." Deel shifts the scanner to one hand and neels down to check him for weapons. "Still would like to know what they wanted with that ship. Maybe after you stand up and clear your head you can give me the details." He listens to what he had to say about what had happened. "Well I guess that you found out what Imperial hospitality was like. So did all this happen before or after they found the ship?"

Biardi leaves the wookie corpse behind and joins the others in the hallway. He listens to the story and so far it seems to add up with what little they know of the place. After Antur’s search reveals Duran is unarmed he decides there’s no reason to be rude. Reaching down Biardi offers the injured man a hand to help him stand.
**“No we’re not pirates,”** he says with a laugh. **“I’m Biardi.”**

### **Snowkrash** (2010-07-09 10:35:00)

Duran stands up slowly, remembering upon his ascension, the pain at back of his head. With help from Biardi, he manages to stand upright; he dusts himself once he’s all the way up.
“**Well no friend of the empire’s, is a friend to me. Duran Vassic.**” He says in low gravelly voice; he appears to be slightly less hostile with his last statement.
“**If you don’t mind me asking, what brings you to our little corner of space? There’s not much out here, anymore, except some really upset Wookies and some stark raving mad imperials. I believe there are some supplies the empire left behind before departing; I can show you where those are if you like.**” He looks around the room, noting everyone’s reaction.

Arty listens to the story of the base and what had become of this individual. However it was only after the pat down did she lower her blaster and keep it to one hand at her side.
"We're here to rescue the wookie's and find out what happened." She says simply, moving back away from them to check out the room. The hung Imperials was a sight that both made her stomach turn and feel a sense of satisfaction, whatever or whoever did it clearly didn't like them anymore than her bunch did, and that was a good sign.
"Time to get back to work guys!" she calls back to them, heading towards one of the openings. Her blaster finds solace between both hands in front of her as she moves to a wall to merge against.

There is a hallway on the other side of the mechanics bay that leads towards the Barracks area. The hall way looks like it has seen a massive battle. There are blast marks up and down the hall. There looks to be some structural damage from maybe an explosion of some sort. The door looks like it has been spot welded closed.

### **Valheru** (2010-07-09 23:34:49)

Jake found nothing more of interest in immediate area where the battle took place. The others were conversing with the survivor that they had found so he left them to that while he kept an eye out for other possible dangers.
As he made his way back to the group Arty call out that it's time to get back to work. He smiled and nodded. **"Sure thing, not like we're here for a vacation anyways. Where to?"** He said as he rechecked his weapon and fell in line with Arty and Jordan.

### **Snowkrash** (2010-07-10 15:41:35)

Duran pulls Biardi close to talk to him privately.
“**I don’t know anything really. I heard some rumors of something they found down there in the mines. Since being demoted, the imperials felt I was no longer on a ‘need to know’ basis. After all, I had my ‘duties’ to perform. What I know is, what was said in whispers in the general mess and in the hallways. Everybody had their own theories on what it was, but nobody was entirely sure.**”
Duran shrugs.
“**Whatever it was, they were sure in a hurry to get away from it. It’s anyone’s guess as to what might be done there. Frankly, I’m not that curious to see what it is. If it’s all the same to you, I’d like to get off this planet and then pepper this place with a few hundred blasts from a battle cruiser, jump to hyperspace and never…look…back. The imperials left this place for a reason, and they left without saying goodbye. What does that tell you?**”
Duran’s look is dead serious. He regards Biardi for a moment, and takes a brief scan around the room and then looks back at Biardi.
“**Whatever it is, it’s doing its damnedest to make sure those who find it end up becoming permanent residents here**.”
Duran gives Biardi a pat on the shoulder and says aloud “**Anyone got any water? I could really use a drink of water right now.**”
Duran scans the room for a liquid refreshment dispenser.

### **Valheru** (2010-07-10 22:09:29)

Biardi nods and grabs a canteen from his belt.
**"Here ya go,"** he says as he offers the canteen to Duran.
The duros frowns as he mulls over what has been said.
**"Well I'm afraid I have bad news,"** he says with a sigh.
**"The Emperor himself has sent someone named Tremayne to retrieve the ship. Whatever it is I don't feel comfortable leaving it in their hands. If it only we *could* bomb this place from orbit, but we lack that kind of firepower."**
As they reach the welded door Biardi begins examining it to see how easily his tool kit's fusion cutter will be able to cut through the weld.
**"Should we cut our way through or try to find another entrance? If anything on the other side doesn't already know we're here it certainly will if we fire up the fusion cutters,"** he says quietly.
((Mechanics +9 to examine to welding))

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-07-11 06:19:45)

Jordan walks up to the door, and looks back to Biardi. This was some of the procedures he had been training the Republic Commandos in.
**"I´m not sure about that. Fusion Cutters are slow, and before we´re through anyone on the other side will have had ample time to set up an ambush. We could blow it right off, and hopefully catch anyone on the other side by surprise"**
He turned around and looked at the rest of the squad.
**"Or we could also try to find another route in. If we leave someone here working the cutter, we could keep anyone´s attention on the door, and maybe foil an ambush. This is all precautions though, since we don´t know if there actually is anyone on the other side"**

Arty moves along the wall to the large door, looking it over. "I don't know about anyone else, but if I had something in the heart of this place that I didn't want anyone else to get to I'd seal off the closest entrance and keep a guard there." She motions to the door "it may take longer to get in there, but finding another way around might be best if we don't want to go through an ambush of wookies or worse" She looks over to Antur "you're in charge here. Should we blow the door or try to find a way around?"

Deel checks the scanner again to make sure nothing else was going to jump out at them. He was half listening to what the others where saying, but he heard something about a door and needing to get through it. He snaps to attention. Truning to Antur. "I can take a crack at it boss if you like? Might be able to crack the lock and get inside." Deel was confident of his abilitites to figure out most problems. He moves over to the door and starts to look for where the controls might be.

When talk of blowing up doors begins Antur looks around to the group "Have we finished checking every accessible door and corridor?" Antur thinks for a moment. "Lets quickly check all the routes we have, though if it was sealed it might be the only way through." Antur looks to Duran "Are you with us or are you staying here?"

### **Frost** (2010-07-12 19:36:26)

**The Barracks door**
The door is a standard sized bulkhead entry way. It has a basic locking mechanism. It has been spot welded closed, the job looks hasty and incomplete. On closer inspection you can see some dents about head level. The dents came from the other side of the door.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Yogi** (2010-07-12 23:52:42)

Jake looked over the door that had several dents coming from the other side. The spot weld was hastily done but it had held. He looked at the others.
**"Guys maybe they welded this shut for a reason."** He tapped the dent with the business end of his rifle. **"We head in there we man need more than what we're carrying."**

**"There might be another entrance from the outside. I'll go check."**

Deel didn't want to sound like a coward, but he wasn't a warrior like the rest the rest of his friends. His job was to keep them in the fight. " With a plan of the facility we may be able to figure out where we need to go, but right now that may not be possible. The computer core needs more then I can give it now.

He listens for a moment, taking stock of the situation, and decides the farther away he is from this place, the better.
“**You could try the ventilation shafts. They run throughout the facility. That however presents its own problems though**.”
Duran looks over at Biardi.
“**I’ll accompany you outside. Anyone else?**”

Biardi looks at Duran and nods. If the man was a security guard he hopefully knows how to handle himself in a fight. Duran's story seems on the up and up but Biardi doesn't quite trust him enough to hand him a weapon yet. If things get hairy...well they can cross that bridge when they get there.
The duros waits for a moment to see if any of the others want to accompany him before heading outside. He sticks to the wall thinking he'll be less visible against it than the snowy tundra and heads for the outside door to the barracks.

Arty sighs as she returns to the others that were still in the hallway "No other hallways, I suppose it's either stay here and wait for them or go out in the..snow...with them." She couldn't help the shudder at the idea of going back out into the cold; stupid cold...it was all...cold and..stuff.
Sighing she looks to Antur, "I think I'm going to head out with them, we shouldn't split up like this you know?" She sighs and moves to follow the others, bringing the hood up and over her head in some vain attempt to keep what warmth she had collected.

You find the outer door has been locked shut and the lock looks blasted. None of the building you have seen have any sort of windows.
The pounding continues it banging. It sounds sequential now that you have been listening for a few moments.
**Bang Bang…Bang…Bang Bang…Bang…Bang Bang…Bang**

Kro-sa had lain half on his side, listening to the newest sounds of blaster fire, frantically hoping for freedom or death. He had been moving the only part of his body he could, his head, and taking advantage of the muzzle the Imperials had placed on him. The thing was large, encompassing most of his head and extending out from it quite a bit. It made for an improvised knocker.
When the return knock came he wasn't sure if it was his imagination or his aching head picking up his own echoes. He paused listening, then decided either way his frustration was winning out. He began lashing his head against the wall as despair and madness fought for control of him...

This large building looks larger and newer than the other. It has an Imperial symbol on the side and resembles a detention block. There walls are lined with security doors.

"I sure hope you didn't pick the door with the giant radioactive wookie behind it. Ready to storm out and rip us a collective new one." Deel takes out his security kit and sets to opening the door. He checks over the door and the lock to make sure there no surprises, then strata working on the lock. "I don't know what I hate more now, the cold and snow or heat and sand. Both are bothersome and eritatating. Kind of like watching Arty try to help me in the engine room." Deel laughs as he pokes fun at his friend.

Just beyond the door is a disturbing sight. A large Barabel lies on its side, hands and feet bound together, tail secured by the same durasteel cable, with a large muzzle encompassing its face. It continues to thrash about, albeit weakly, the durasteel muzzle clanging against the metal wall. In its eyes you can see madness looming close but not yet the conqueror, battling against a desperate hope. Even curled up and bound so that it cannot move, the Barabel buck looks to be roughly 1.9 meters tall and weigh close to 170 kilos but seems to suffer from malnutrition and the cold. His scales are a green so dark as to almost be black on his back, and they become paler towards his stomach. His scales also have the rich deep color that young Barabels show, where as they become older they darken and lose their luster.

Arty nods "okay you can hear me." she had managed to catch the second shake before the interruption, thankfully. Nodding she taps the guard around his head "I'm gonna ask you a few questions before I let you up okay? Are you with the imperials in any form? Are you being effected by the same thing the wookies are? Do you intend to bring harm to anyone in here?" She'd wait for the answering shakes or nods before looking up to Antur"anything you want to ask him before i get this thing off?"

Biardi is surprised to see a barabel behind the door but recovers quickly. Deciding, whether correctly or not, that the poor creature has been the victim of Imperial oppression he moves to help.
**"Arty,"** he says gently, **"the Imperials don't employ aliens except as slaves."** A hint of bitterness enters his voice with the word alien.
Biardi begins removing the barabel's muzzle, not waiting for the others' questions to be satisfied. Even so he remains ready to leap out of the way if the barabel snaps at him. Despite Biardi's conviction the look in the being's eyes does make him a little wary.

Antur takes note of the piercing animal like howl in the distance.
Antur stands by providing cover as Arty repeats the banging on the door. Smiling as Deel slices past the imperial security lock out.
Antur looks surprised to see the bound Barabel fully expecting another Wookie mutant.

Once the muzzle is gone Kro-sa smacks his lips and clacks his teeth repeatedly, trying to become accustomed to the freedom of movement again. After a short time he says, **"Dissss one dankssss you, sssssentient,"** to the Duros who removed the muzzle.
He then turns to look at the small human, a kind he doesn't think he's seen before, what with most of his interactions having been with Imperials, and says, **"Disssss one doesss not know what a 'Wookie' issssss. Isssss it food sssstuffssss? If beingssss here are not Imperial disssss one will not harm dem. Dissss onessss issss called Kro-sssssa. Peassse, dissss one hassss not fed in many dayssss. Peasssse free Kro-ssssa?"** He writhes and 's-issses' in discomfort while the maybe-saviors make their decision.

Arty frowned as she had to listen closer to get the words past all the hissing. Kro-sa he said his name was, and starving no less. Turning from him to her belt she grabs a ration back "Untie him." she says, glancing to Antur "won't hurt us only imperials and the wookies will be alright.." she glances to the others "I'm not gonna let him starve, if you can spare it let him have a ration pack."
Looking back to the creature she holds the ration back for his inspection until he was free "will this be alright to eat? we don't have much and they may not taste like much but they're filling at least."

Jake kept watch over Arty as she was helping the Barabel. He removes one of his one ration packs and handed it to Arty. **If he's as hungry as he says he is he'll need more."**
He looked around there wasn't much. He hadn't answered Antur's question yet because he wasn't sure on what to do yet. He look at his CO. **"We came here to rescue wookie slaves. they don't seem to be here and the ones that are aren't what we came for. Question is how much longer do we have down here before the Imps take notice? That pile of junk we came in on against anything significant isn't exactly the best odds."**

Deel looks over the readings he was getting on the scanner. "Boss still getting that energy reading from inside the mine. Also most of the life readings are coming from the entrance." Deel was glad that there wasn't any giant scary radioactive wookies waiting to kill them here. "Should we pop any of these other door and see whats there?"

### **Valheru** (2010-07-20 17:31:57)

The barabel appears to be non-hostile, well as non-hostile as barabels ever get, so Biardi continues undoing the restraints.
**"You're welcome Kro-sa. I am Biardi. Wookies are a sentient race that the Empire uses as slaves. We came here to rescue them but it seems something terrible has happened to them. How long have you been in here?"**
Biardi is mostly focusing on Kro-sa and his restraints but at Deel's suggestion he glances over at the twi'lek.
**"Good idea. We may not like what we find but…I'm not sure anybody deserves to rot in an abandoned prison."**

### **Magical2099** (2010-07-20 17:57:01)

As Kro-sa is freed he gingerly takes the ration packs from the small human, careful of the soft skin. He slits them open easily with his claw and dumps the contents into his maw, swallowing them whole.
**"Many dankssssss,"** he hisses. **"Water?"** he asks, then tries to stand and finds his legs won't quite hold him. **"Hep?"** he asks holding his arms up for a hand.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Valheru** (2010-07-20 18:19:59)

Biardi offers Kro-sa a canteen. Once the barabel has had his fill Biardi returns the canteen to his belt. With one hand he takes hold of Kro-sa's arm and grabs unto the wall with the other. He has a feeling he might need the support considering the barabel is much larger. When they're both ready the duros heaves.

Arty stands and moves to aid them, moving under the Barabel's arm to give her own support as her free arm wraps around his waist "come on..up you get..." She says, lifting with them to help him stand up.
She looks to the others then back to the barabel "Wookies are big, bigger than any of us and furry, they have a language that uses roars and growls to speak, have you seen any like that? what got you in here like this?"

While still supporting him Biardi studies the barabel to see how he’s doing.
**“How do you feel? Do you think you can walk on your own?”**
He hopes Kro-sa will be ambulatory. Otherwise they’ll have to leave the barabel behind if they want to investigate the rest of the facility. It’d be too much of a liability to have two members of their team supporting him in hostile territory.

**"Kro-sssssa can walk. Many dankssssssss, sssssentientsssss,"** Kro-sa says to the two helping him. He moves out from between them and moves around as much as he can.
**"Sssssleep and meat will make Kro-sssssa better. Can kill Dormtroopersssss now. Who are you ssssentientssss? Where are we?

"Krossa? Or how ever you say it, your free now. You can go about your way or you can help us free any other survivors." Antur says to Kro-ssssa just before Arty starts looking to feed the new one.
Antur nods to Deel "Good work Deel, are you able to figure out what the power source is?" Antur nods as the other explain inter species differences to the new one, weird he does not know what a Wookie is how accurate was our intel?
"Ok we are going to have to go inside, watch each others backs and no one I mean no one strays from the group. Bardi you and Arty take the rear, Jake your point with me." Antur readies his weapon and steps into the entrance moving further inside.

"You had asked what that burning white is out here, it's snow, it's cold too." She shudders "I hate the cold." Leveling her blaster to her side, ready to aim and fire if need be she looks around them "so..anyone have an idea where we're going next?"

The mine is about five clicks down a large trail that has been packed into the snow. On the right side of the path about four clicks is a large storage building.

Jake nodded as Antur spoke. ***Into the hole we go. This ought to be fun.*** He thought.
**"Roger that Antur."** Jake said as he rose from his kneeling position and moved to the front. He checked his weapon over to make sure it was still in top operating condition as the weather conditions were anything but favorable. Satisfied he looked back to the others. **"You all ready to go and see what we can find?"**

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Frost** (2010-07-27 14:22:48)

You do a quick search of the detention center and find several large suits of cold weather gear but no other prisoners. Once the Barbel has suited up the squad starts moving down the wide path. As you get closer to the mine entrance you see the large industrial lift that takes ore and slaves in and out of the mine. As you get closer you see a large hole has been dug out of the snow near the storage facility. You are still about a click (1000 meters) from the mine entrance

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Valheru** (2010-07-27 22:03:09)

Biardi is mostly focusing behind the team but eventually he notices the large hole in front of them. He checks one last time to make sure there's nothing sneaking up on them from behind. 'The only good thing about all this blasted snow is that it'll at least make it hard for anyone to ambush us,' he thinks to himself. Satisfied he turns his attention to the front to study the hole and the surrounding area.

Duran regards Biardi and then looks back at the hole.
“**This doesn’t look like anything I’ve ever seen. I’m no miner, but I’m fairly certain this isn’t part of the plan.**”
Duran gives Biardi a dubious glance after examining the hole.

Arty makes her way with the others, checking their surroundings as they move for anything unwanted. As the company comes to a halt by the hole, the human takes a moment to glance at it "It's near the other building..maybe someone tried to get in by digging under?"
Glancing to the others, Antur in particular she motions to the storage "should we go and see just what's in there if anything or continue on down to the mines?" She looks over to the others "couldn't hurt...if there was more than just food in there it might be nice to know if anyone else here has weapons."

Kro-sa feels his stomach turn a little at the sheer amount of dead flesh in the crater. He turns to the others and asks, **"Are deeessss de wookiesssss ssssssentientsss are looking for?"** si-issing his discomfort.
He crouches down at the edge and quells his stomach before he peers deeper into the hole, trying to spot a common cause of death. **"Doooran? Knowssss dissss place? But not Imperial?"** he asks, eying the human who had suggested leaving him chained.

Jordan had just followed behind quietly, keeping eyes and ears open, but his mouth shut. He had been watching the Barabel, and he seemed unlikely to be a threat to them. As they walked upon the sight of the dead wookies though, he muttered a few Mandalorian curses under his breath. He liked Wookies, and considered them a brave and noble species. To see so many of them massacred made him quite angry to say the least.

Antur nods to Kro "Ok you stay in the rear guard and watch our backs." Antur starts his way down as Kro-sssa tells his story, carried then dumped here.
Down as ways they find the hole, what in the stars? "No Duran it does not look like part of the plan." Taking a closer look at the hole, does it look man made or machine? "Yea Arty come here take a look at this with me, what do you guys think?" Antur takes a step back when he sees the bodies, the cold must have frozen the bodies or we would have smelled them sooner. "This place aint right, I will be glad when this mission is over. Those poor beings."
"We need to keep moving, lets go. Move out!" Antur nods to Jake then continues to move on.

A look of disgust passes over Biardi’s face at the sight of so many dead wookies.
**“They just butchered them like animals,”** his voice betraying the fury struggling with nausea inside him.
This place is getting worse all the time. The duros is only too happy to keep moving. The sooner they can leave this rock the better.

Turning back to the storage room, she does her best to gain access and check the insides.

No matter how disgusting it may look, this wasn´t Jordans first sight of a massacre. He had been a soldier for a about two decades now, and had seen his share and more of what could happen in battle. Which coincidentally, he figured, might help them now.
Moving to the pile of dead Wookies, he starts to examine them, trying to spot blaster holes, blade punctuations, or anything that might tell him what had killed these Wookies.

"We need to keep moving, lets go. Move out!" Antur said as he nodded to Jake.
**"Aye. The quicker were off this forsaken planet the better."** The pilot followed alongside Antur for a few feet before Jordan called out for them to hang on. Jake continued on for another few paces then knelt down to one knee. Looking back he checked to see what the soldier wanted to check on. He saw Jordan checking over the dead Wookies.
***How many times are we going to stop and smell the roses?*** He thought.
**"The longer we wait the greater the chance the we're going to tangle with some Imps."**.

Arty moves up to the door of the storage facility. The door isn't locked and opens into a large warehouse full of cargo containers. The warehouse is almost full as she sees rows and rows of boxes stacked four high in neat rows. She also spots several cargo lifter droids moving around stacking cargo and cleaning up.
Jordan slides down the steep slope into the pit. He muscles around a few of the frozen corpses as best he can. He is able to determine that these Wookies were killed by blaster fire, heavy blaster fire by the size of the blast marks and the damage done. He confirms this by climbing out and and searching around the area. He spots two spots where he sees the distinctive marks of a tri-pod. Next to the marks he sees a melted spot where a power pack would have been.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-04 06:45:53)

Drawing a sign of relief, Jordan walks back to the others.
**"I think it is safe to say the Imps killed these guys. Most likely they were executed by an E-Web or something similar, which I suppose the garrison here would have a few of"**
He was comforted by this fact, since it meant that they had not been killed by another one of those mutated Wookies. That would have been tragic in many ways, but more importantly, it would have hinted that there might be more of those things loose out there.

“**Those boxes that Kro-sa is trying lift or open, they’re filled with ionite. I know…this was my post. A post I can hopefully leave behind me. I’ll let you break the news to the ‘general’**.”
He smirks, patting Biardi on the shoulder.

Arty looks in at the boxes, the rows and rows of them and the droids that simply went on as though nothing had been happening. Shaking her head she looks back to their new companion and nods "yes..lets see just what's in one of these things before we get going, may be useful." She grins but keeps her eye on the droids, they may be busy and likely that was all they were programed to do but...hell they had mutated wookies now! she was not about to take anything to chance.

Working together you manage to unseal one of the climate controlled crates. Inside are large chunks of discolored ice. According to the read outs on the crate it contains unrefined Ionite. A quick estimate suggest roughly fifty tons of it are stacked up ready for transport. A labor droid wanders by but pays you no mind.

### **Valheru** (2010-08-06 23:17:55)

Jordan’s announcement brings little comfort to Biardi. He’d already assumed the Imps had been responsible for the massacre after the message Deel and Arty recovered. Perhaps he should be relieved that the wookies’ deaths were at least quick but that didn’t improve his mood. Sadly there was nothing he could do about it now and perhaps that’s what galled the most.
Biardi focuses on Duran as the man approaches; glad for something to take his mind of the wookies. The duros nods reassuringly.
**“Don’t worry, we’ll get you off this rock.”**
Confusion and a twinge of embarrassment enter his voice.
**“But uh…what’s ionite?”**

Listing to the conversation on how the Wookies died Antur speaks up "Jake is right, good find now we know they have heavy guns but lets keep moving." Antur moves to keep up with Arty.

Keeping an eye out and his ears open to any sounds Jake stays low on one knee as the others talk about what to do. Something was bothering him yet he couldn't put a finger on it. The howling of the winds outside was making any sound sound like it could be anything.
With the others now beginning to moves Jake stands up. but stops almost as quickly looking at the door. There was a voice. Maybe he wasn't sure. Someone calling out. He took a few steps to the door. Straining to hear he looked back at the others as he heard it again.
**"Do you guys hear that? It's coming from outside."** Jake said with his brows furrowed as he strained to listen. **"I'd swear I heard something a voice."** He looked to the door and then back to Antur.
**"Boss, with your permission I want to check it out. She is outside somewhere. I can hear her."** His look was serious. Jake wasn't one for theatrics. Problem was that even if Antur said no Jake was willing to disobey an order and go out the door to find her.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Snowkrash** (2010-08-09 15:36:10)

Duran regards Biardi, shrugs and replies.
“**Not many people know what ionite is. It’s hard to find, in fact to my knowledge, only a handful of places in the universe still have any left. It’s an ore that wreaks havoc on electronics. If it’s concentrated in a particular way, I’m not entirely sure of what that process is, the ore can be refined to make among other things ion weapons; grenades, bombs, missiles, etc.**”
Duran gives Biardi a reassuring nod.

Getting back out of the hole, Jordan follows Antur as he follows Arty inside the facility. He was relieved that he had found no more signs of crazy, mutated Wookies, but he would have been even more relieved if the heavy weaponry had still been in the place where he had found the marks.

I don't even know some of their names. Biardi is the kind Duros. We had some of them as traders before the Empire came. Duran is the other one found here, the one that worked for the Imperials. Antur seems to be the chieftain, the rest follow his lead. The one with snakes on his head is Deel. I'm not sure what the small human's name is, or the one with the big rifle.

Deel keeps his eyes on the scanner. The creates of Ionite where something he wanted to check out but Antur and the others where wanting to press on. He walks behind them not wanting to get anywhere near the hole with the dead wookies. "Boss you want me to mark these creates for pickup. We might be able to load some on the ship, could be something we might need later." Deel couldn't see why they would leave this treasure behind. Other then the fact it was in Imperial creates.

Jake nodded when Antur agreed but asked his questions he wasn't sure he could answer. **"I don't know. It sounds familiar but I cant place it. It sounded like it called my name."**
He looked again to the door as he heard the voice again. He shook his head. At least he thought he did. Arty's voice brought him back around. "Jake you sure you aren't hearing the wind? I don't hear any voices. it's probably just the wind, it can sound like voices against buildings."
He shook his head. **"No arty it's not the wind."** He kind of snapped at her. **"I hear it, her, whatever it is. Look I know it sounds impossible but I'm going to check it out."** When the began to move he heard he had help from an unlikely person the Barabel. Jake nodded at the big lizard. **"Thanks. "** His voice softened. Realizing he hadn't introduced himself to Kro-sa he held out a hand. **"I'm Jake. Thanks."** He said again. Turning he made way to the door that lead to the outside. **"I really hate the cold."** Checking his rifle he opened pushed open the door which let in a howl of wind and snow not to mention colder air. With a nod to Kro-sa Jake moved but stopped. **"I'll keep my comm open."** He yelled back to Antur right before he moved out into the driving wind listening for the sound of the woman's voice.

Arty stared at the other human, her head had jerked at the snap of his words at her, she hadn't meant anything by it...the wind could sound like voices, and in this place she didn't think that was all too unlikely.
Clicking her tongue against her teeth she looks back to the crate, grumbling under her breath. It just figured, Captain snapped at her when he was drunk and now this one snapped when he was hearing voices. "Stupid Men." she grumbles, moving to another crate to see if the contents were the same.

Kro-sa makes an effort to not hurt the human's hand as he grips it, **"Dissss 'cold' issss nuuu to Kro-sssssa. I don't like it eidder,"** he replies as they walk outside. He pauses and scents the air while scanning for movement in the snow, thankful for the boots they had found earlier. He found walking in them odd, but they were much better than going barefoot here.
**"Why doessss disss group of ssssssentientsssss wissssssh to free ssssssslavessss?"** he asks, still curious about his erstwhile saviors.

Arty sees that all the cargo boxes have the same markings and a quick check reveals similar cargo inside. Arty feels a unnerving chill run down her spine, the urge to run out of this large dark open area floods her but with her force of will and firm convictions it passes quickly.
Biardi moves to follow Jake out of the storage facility. His face seems a lighter shade of blue than normal. His hands seem to shake as he tries to not to seem like he is rushing.
Deel continues to monitor the power levels coming from the lower levels of the mine. The scanner flickers for a moment as its lights dim. The screen goes dark as the device loses power.

Deel stops and smacks the scanner to get it working more. "Cheap piece the crap! Well that is useless now." Deel puts the scanner away. He strats to look around at the creates in the stroage room. "Well unless we find a loader droid we aren't getting of this to the ship." He leaves the storage room and heads further down the corridor. Moving slowly so as not loss track of anyone that maybe behind him. He keeps a look out for anything that might be of interest. Maybe there was a terminal or something that might shed more light on what they where running into.

Arty glances over the boxes quickly, all the same..why do they want so many? A sudden urge moves through her body that had her wanting to run from the room as fast as she possibly could.
Closing her eyes, a sharp intake of breath and a moment taken holding a crate along with a few choices words whispered "relax..it's just your imagination...it's just this whole place..relax.." And she was fine again.
Sighing she turns back to the others "they're all the same, why would they want so many of these things?" She looks over to Antur, moving to his side with a sigh, she just..needed some reassurance that's all. "Maybe it's time we get going?"

Now out in the driving snow with Kro-sa Jake listenes for the voice that has been calling him. The biting and howling wind make the effort that much more difficult. He takes a few steps back towards the ship but stops as he looks around.
At Kro-sa's question Jake shrugged not that he would have noticed with the heavy winter gear on. **"Why wouldn't we. What the Empire does on most things is wrong. The fact that they believe humans are better than others is flawed. I've known many non-humans that I would trust with my life"**
Hearing the womans voice again he quit talking. Looking around again his gaze fell on the mine. Taking a few steps in it's direction the voice came to him again. Not sure if he was hearing with his ears or if it was all in his head he began walking towards the mine. His pace quickened as he got closer as the voice seemed to get stronger. He wasn't sure what he would fnd but he ws determined to find the source.
**"This way Kro-sa. In here I think."** He said as he entered the opening of the mine.

The cold slows his blood and makes him feel sluggish, so when Jake heads for the mine entrance he makes an effort to move faster, hoping to hold off the sluggishness a while longer. *Do real questions distract from imagined sounds?

Turning towards the rest of the group he announces the information.
**"This ionite can be used for weapons. Even if we can't figure out how to use it we should keep it out of the Empire's hands if we can."**
It seems the duros is about to say more when a sudden shiver runs down his spine. A look of dread mars his face and he calls out after Jake.

### **Frost** (2010-08-16 11:30:09)

The mine entrance is a big hole in the suface of the ice. The shaft is large enough for a small transport to fly down it. There is a large industrial turbo lift for loading slaves, equipment, and removing ore. The storage facility is maybe a thousand meters from the actual mine entrance. The wind has died down swiftly and the night air has become very very quiet. Jake, Biardi, and Kro-sa start making thier way towards the large turbolift. The snow crunching under thier feet and the wisps of thier hot breath leaking out from the cold weather gear are the only real noise at this time.
Inside the storage facility the atmosphere seems oppressive. The cargo stored here makes the place have a maze like feel to it. You feel like if you went in to deep you might not make it back.

Looking over to Jake Antur nods "Keep your comm open, and this one goes with you." Antur points to Kro-ssa.
"we need to keep moving lets go"

"Ok, Boss." Deel responds to Antur's orders. Without activating the loader droids it was going to be fun to get these creates to the ship anyway. Deel would have to check them over later anyway. Hopefully they where to damaged or effected by the cold. That could make the job alot more fun.
Deel moves a further into the storage area. It was starting to get kind of scary in there to him. It seemed to go on forever. He stops and turns around and walks back out of the Storage area to the corridor and heads to where Antur and the others whee heading. "Hey Boss wait up." A little hint of fear in his voice. This place was starting to get to him.

While not exactly reckless Biardi has never been known to be overcautious. However, this place definitely has him spooked.

The mine shaft was large. It spoke of what they may have been doing down there. Looking around he took in the surroundings upon entering Jake noticed the wind had died down considerably with the mine providing them shelter from outside.
What bothered him was the silence. It was almost too quiet. Each sound they made seemed to be that much louder. The amount of cargo stored in the area was massive. Almost so that navigating around it might be impossible. To his side he heard Kro-Sa who was standing at the controls to the lift. "Jake, Biardi, will we be going down alone? Do we have to go down at all? Jake, issss voice down?"
Jake looked around once more and walked to where the lift was. holding on to the railing he listened. Listened for the voice of the woman that sounded so familiar yet remained unknown to him.

As Jake listens the wind dies down and it gets very calm and quiet. The cold crisp air makes everything seem louder but the only sound you hear is your own heartbeat and your companions breathing.
Inside the ware house the only sounds are the load lifters stacking cargo. The place is dark and the cargo box maze seems to take up most of the building. There are no other rooms seen from your position at the entry way. Do you venture in deeper or do you rejoin the other squad members at the turbo lift

"Hey Boss I am going to check out a couple more things in the warehouse. Might have something that may help with the heavy lifting if any comes up." He puts away his comm link and heads back in looking for the controls for the lifter droids.

Biardi pauses briefly as he goes through an internal struggle. Studying Duran he decides to trust him. He reaches for his blaster pistol and hands it to the man.
**"Here. Rampaging mutated wookies might miss the subtleties of your humor."**
The pilot chuckles with levity he doesn't feel, trying to mask his trepidation. He moves onto the lift and hovers his hand over the controls.
Biardi quips, **"Anyone else going down?"**

Arty nudges Anturs shoulder and Antur returns the favor mostly on instinct. The pair had always gotten along, though this mission and its dangers where distracting Antur which is saying a lot when it distracts him from Arty. "I am not going to argue with that, lets go Arty lead the way."

**"I-, I hate to say it Arty, and I hope I'm wrong but…well, after what we saw out there…"**
His eyes close as he recalls the terrible mass grave. After a moment the red eyes snap open and he continues.
**"I don't think we'll find any wookies. Not-"** he pauses, searching for the right word, **" not *normal* ones, anyways."**

He wished he had a less hostile and cold place to do the work but this would have to do. Kind of reminded him of there first mission together as the Voidstalkers. They where sent in to pull out Senator Mon Motha before she was captured by Imperial troops. He had showed his skills to the team then when he had hot wired and speeder and kept it flying despite the damage ithad taken in there get away. There missions had always been interesting to say the least and he was always busy fixing, upgrading or replacing stuff ever sense. It was a busy life, but he liked it that way. *"Ok, this wire here. Hook my data pad here if needed. Ya piece of spice cake."* Deel smiles. This was not going to be to much of a problem after all.

Stepping onto the lift with the rest of them, Jordan leans towards one of the supports in the lift, letting his rifle hang loose in his sling at his side. He was willing to agree with Biardi, it seemed unlikely they would find any more Wookies here, except for more of those mutated freaks. Given those circumstances, it seemed wisest to just get out of there. But of course, there was a certain curiosity that him wanting to stay there, and also the prospect of getting to deliver some damage to the Empire.
Suddenly something blurred by outside the lift, in the support structure. Reacting on instinct, the Mandalorian warrior was immediately on his feet, and his one hand dropped down to hold the pistol grip of his rifle, though he didn´t quite raise it to a ready position.

He hadn't raised his weapon yet, which could only mean that whatever was out there wasn't close enough yet..or didn't want to alert it that they were aware.

At the mention of something moving Antur orders "Weapons ready all." Antur readies his blaster pistol setting it on lethal. Looking up Antur blinks away a vision of a hulking Wookie climbing above his crew. Antur stands ready for anything, the door to open, a primal Wookie attack, anything.

*These Wookies are good climbers?* Kro-sa wonders after hearing Biardi. He begins looking upward, remembering the tactic he used to kill three squads of Stormtroopers. *Heh, Wookies smart.*
Feeling the tension rise in his newfound companions Kro-sa begins to get nervous, their anxiety rubbing off on him. *Why are they so jumpy? I don't see anything,* he begins to think before catching a flash of the furry creature diving for cover. He begins to si-issss his discomfort while looking at all the darkened areas that he can see perfectly, *Wookies are sneaky too.*
When Antur gives the order to ready weapons Kro-sa looks around slightly confused, then grins and si-issses his amusement. *They must think me capable since they found me bound like that. They are right,* he continues si-isssing softly, the Barabel rendition of chuckling.
He looks towards Biardi, **"Are dey ssssupposssssed to be ssssssneaky too? Kro-sssa can ssssee in darknessss, but can't ssssee Wookiesssss,"** he says, the anxiety starting to creep back in, overcoming his short lived mirth.

Biardi's rifle is already snapping up into position when Antur's order goes out. He saw something too this time and he's a little on the jumpy side right now. His eyes scan the darkness as best they can, rifle following and ready to fire. It definitely looked liked a Wookie to him. The question is...is mutated or not?

*Location: Ionite Mine 1st Level*
The turbolift continues to lower itself down into the polar ice cap. You can all feel the vibration of the motor humming through you. The air down this deep smells slightly foul and stale. You can all see the creature as it continues to climb up the scaffolding. It looks to be a Wookie or some other hairy bipedal creature. It has black or dark brown fur, you can’t tell at this distance. It leaps with incredible agility as it launching itself from beam to beam. It quickly moves up high enough where you can no longer see it as it vanishes into the darkness.
With a loud clang the turbo lift reaches the first floor of the mine. The whole place seems deserted. You see no signs of power or life. There is a barricade placed across the exit and a warning sign with a picture of rocks falling. The barricade seems to have been here a long time. There is another level below this one.
*Location: Ionite Warehouse* 
It takes Deel a few minutes but he quickly reprograms the droid to accept commands from him. He also realizes that these droids share a command structure so he uses that to pass on his security update. Soon all three of the load lifters now will accept the young mechanics commands. Deels gives a satisfied sigh and starts putting his tools and diagnostic gear. The large droid stands up and turns to face Deel. Its mechanical voice rings out and echos through the dark warehouse.

*Location: Ionite Mine Top of turbolift*
Duran watches as the turbolift lowers down deep into the polar ice cap. He is about to turn away when he catches a glimpse of movement from the scaffolding holding the turbolift.. He watches as the movement gets closer. He moves back away from the entrance to the shaft as the hairy creature gets closer. With a loud thump the creature hurls itself onto the platform in front of Duran. The large Wookie has blood red eyes and large dense bone growth protruding from its body. Its enlarged jaw has huge glistening teeth that have drool running down them. The creature leans in close toward Duran and inhales a deep breath through its nose. It rears back up to its full height and starts to make a c**huff chuff chuff** noise in its throat.

The duros almost fires but hesitates, unwilling to risk hitting an innocent. With a grunt of frustration Biardi lets his rifle hang from its shoulder strap and whips out his comlink.
**"Duran, heads up! We just spotted a wookie climbing up the shaft. I don't know if it's mutated or not so be careful."**

This was easy work for him. He figured that the Empire would have them better secured then this. Then again they where just loader droids after all they did not contain any secrets or anything important.
After he finishes this droid he closes up it's back, and reactivates it. "Droid. Pick up that create and move it over there." Deel orders the droid to make sure his programming held. When he was sure that it was working right he would move on to another droid.

The load lifter moves over and grabs the crate. It's servo give a whrr as it lifts the huge crate with ease. It clanks across the room towards the area Deel specified. It gently lowers the container to the ground. Hit turns and faces Deel awaiting further instruction.
*Location: Top side Turbo lift*
The wookie growls a deep low growl and moves in close to Duran's face. It inhales with a deep breath. Then it's red eyes lock with Duran's. A few very tense moments pass then it and turns it's head and looks towards the main complex. With a huge leap it clears the stairs and lands on the ground. It looks up at Duran with a hateful look and roars. It turns and starts running up the road towards the main complex and the ship. Duran breathes a sigh of relief.
*Locaton: Mine 1st level*
The Barbarel moves off into the darkness ignoring the warning barricade. He soon moves out of the light range and you lose sight of him in the darkness. Follow, continue down, head back up, or wait for him to return. Tough decisions leaders have to make to accomplish their missions.

Antur watches the beast carefully "umm what was that?" Then the lift stops, Antur sees the barricade the sign and the next level below. "Ok no more splitting up, down here we stay together that's an order!" As Antur finishes his statement the Barbarel runs off, with a sigh Antur continues "That way, I guess"

Arty really had to laugh, so much for listening to the leaders first. She offers a faint grin to Antur before moving ahead after the Barbarel, taking a glow stick from her equipment to light their way. She shifts it to her left hand, allowing her right hand easier access to her blaster. "Easy as we go guys..." she says

After Deel finishes with the droids and puts away his tools. He looks around to make nothing else was going to jump out and rip his head off. This place had a habit of doing that. Staified that the galaxy was not trying to kill him just now. He decides to go and check on his friends. "Droids follow me." And he begins to walk toward the lift.

Biardi speaks into the comlink again. Unable to get a response he puts the device away with a sigh. He's got a bad feeling about this whole place but orders are orders. Besides, they have a wandering barabel to keep out of trouble...
With blaster rifle in one hand and glow rod in the other Biardi steps off the lift and follows his squadron into the darkness.

Duran checks in with Biardi.
“**Duran, here. I copy. I’m alright. I don’t what that was; I’m pretty sure this blaster would’ve just made it more mad. It ran off, out of the complex, out into the open. I am going to follow it, see where it’s going. I'll check back when I know more of what’s going on.**”
He un-holsters his weapon and starts to track the path of the “wookie”. Carefully, he notes in the manner the wookie was moving in. Didn’t look normal, something was very, very wrong. As he’s waking along, he’s taking care not to be ambushed any more of these things. His level of alertness is palatable.

The squad starts moving down the corridor following the lizard. The floor is slick causing you to move slowly and carefully. Kro-sa leads the way through the dark. The drip drip drip sound of water falling from the ceiling is the only sound you hear besides the crunching of the ice beneath your feet.
*Ionite Warehouse*
Deel and his three robot companions move out of the warehouse and start heading towards the mine turbolift. He sees Duran moving down the path back towards the main complex. He is moving cautiously with a pistol out and seems to following tracks through the snow.

He steps forward lightly, looking for threats and the basic layout of the area. He makes a point of moving slowly enough to stay within his companions visual range as much as possible.
**"Dis, dis remind Kro-sssa of home. Tunnelsss, darknessss, would be perfect if not for coldssss,"** he reminisces as he wanders forward.

Arty moves forward slowly, the warning given by the one ahead a welcome reminder of what was likely underneath...well...what she hoped was underneath, she didn't really want to look down and possibly see blood or bones or...blegh..no thanks.
Still, naturally, he mentioned it and what happens? "whoa!" she calls foot skidding slightly. She pauses, arms out and eyes wide as she catches her balance again and laughs faintly "figures I'd slip. See anything up there Kro?" she asks, seeing how a nickname fits on the lizard man.

Antur smiles, on a mission like this running side by side with Arty is sometimes as close as he can get to her. For now it will have to do. Still running after the Barbarel Antur finds himself distracted with thoughts of Arty. Antur turns a slight shade of red when Arty sees the sly look on his face, she probably has an idea of what I was thinking.
Following after Kro-sa Antur begins to think its too quite. "This is too easy, stay alert guys be ready for anything." Antur follows his own order scanning the area as they go.

He continues forward, stepping carefully and straining to watch both his feet and his surroundings. As the groups' leader orders attention, Kro-sa looks around bewildered for a moment, *How could someone not be wary and high strung in an environment like this?!?!* he thinks, before shaking his muzzle and moving on, wishing he could move more and faster. He can feel the cold seeping further into his limbs, which seem to grow heavier with each breath as his reptilian physiology allows his blood to slow with the dropping temperature.

*Location: Ionite Mine 1st Level*
As Kro-sa carefully makes his way deeper into the tunnel, his natural instincts tell him that this tunnel is descending, that its slowly grading downwards into the depths of the planet. The small hand held lights bobble behind him, causing a beautiful and dizzying array of refractions and reflections, throwing shadows and light effects all over the cave. The full weight of Kro-sa’s step is heard as loud crunching noises are made in the ice; the telltale sounds of a weak and brittle footing.
A loud <span style="font-size: 1.50em;">crack</span> echoes throughout the network of tunnels, the reverberating, heart stopping sound sends mental images of falling to everyone in the cave. The squad immediately halts, trying their best not to move or even breathe deeply. They remain still and motionless for what seems like an eternity, making certain they won’t exacerbate their precarious situation even further. The whole mine is silent as the grave, except for the gentle, rhythmic dripping sound of melting ice.

Duran tries to make eye contact with Deel. He makes the universal “shush” sound and points to the comm on his neck. He opens up a secure channel to Deel.
“**Deel, one of those, “Wookies” just surprised me, or maybe we surprised each other. Anyway, I am going to see where’s going; I’m going to make sure we aren’t setting ourselves up for an ambush, if and when, we try to leave this place. To tell you truth, I think I’ve had enough of this place. Deel, I could use some back-up, in the event there is an ambush waiting for us. You up for it?**”
Duran makes some hand gestures and points in the direction where the wookie went.

Arty held still as stone, eyes wide as she felt around her feet slowly, where had it come from? who had stepped wrong? And then he spoke from up ahead, seemed their attempt to find more in this area was over. "Back up!" she calls back to the others, moving slowly backward, not turning just yet. She holds her light outward more trying to find Kro-sa or atleast give him more light to find them.

As Duran's voice comes over his comm, Deel stops and orders the droids to halt. "Understood. I have some new buddies if you think you will need that back up." Deel orders his droid squad in to motion again and heads toward where Duran was last and hopes he will make it time. Switching comms signals. "XO. Everything ok at the ship?

*Location: Ionite Mine Level 1*
The Barabel breaks into a sprint, running back towards the rest of the squad. The rest of you have been gingerly inching your way towards the turbo lift.
The whole tunnel shakes and bucks like an upset Ronto and then for instant, its quiet, a silence hangs in the air, but it’s quickly disturbed by the deafening sound of cracking ice and the realized fear of the deceleration trauma . You all find yourselves in freefall, as the floor shatters and gives way under your weight.
**SPLASH**
In the deep dark, you land (most of you) feet first, into a rushing torrent of frigid cold water; you all struggle to keep your head above the surface as the current whips you back and forth. The disorientation of the bracing temperature, coupled with the speed of which you are moving, you find it difficult to tell what direction you are travelling; you only know you are sliding downwards at a fantastic pace.
For a moment, all of you are caught in a weightless plummet as you make the descent into a much larger body of water. You are momentarily submerged; your natural survival instincts kick in you frantically make your way to the surface and eventually to narrow shore line, carved in the subterranean ice flow.
The unbearable cold eats away at your skin and the core of your body like a molecular acid. Your only desire is to be warm, and preferably dry. You take stock of your surroundings and realize in you are standing in the deteriorating tomb of a crashed spaceship. The polar ice cap, which once concealed this craft far below the surface, is now melting away at an accelerated rate, so much so, that you realize as you look around, you are standing on an island of ice, in a huge subterranean lake. The water down pouring from the top of cave like a rainstorm is feeding this now unnatural underground lagoon.

Arty was yelling for everyone to get back, to move quickly and carefully back to the lift, still guiding the one in front to their position and hopefully safety, and then it happened.
That horrible silence, the calm before the storm, she knew what it meant, her heart stopped but before she had even the chance to yell a warning to run the ground broke and she was falling. She lost her light somewhere in the fall but really once that water hit her body she didn't care. She must have been stepping back, or forward, she hadn't hit with her feet but with her side, thrashing her arms to get her head up and out of the waves "Antur!" she calls out to the water. The waves washing her, and after a bump to..something else, the others with her elsewhere. And then it was frigid, freezing.
Her muscles seized up, her body went into shock from the cold, and her head was still below the water. Panic and need for air, survival instincts kicked in, forcing her legs and arms to work, breaking the surface she gasps in a breath, swimming to the shore line where she crawls forward before collapsing onto the shore, shaking from the cold. She shock, and the cold ground..was that ice?? wasn't helping, it was only causing her clothes to freeze, her lips to turn blue as she shivered and coughed up water. Looking around, she saw the ship but it didn't register in her mind, only stored away for later use; no, instead she was searching for the others, to make sure they were okay "k..k..r...ro'sa!" she stuttered out, "AAntttur!" she called again, moving to her knees to try and see better.

Arty gazes out into the waters around her trying to see signs of anyone else. She sees the large capital ship before her. It has power and it's exterior lighting giving the cavern a soft glow to it. Getting her bearings a little she realizes that she must be on the lower level of the mine for in the distance she can see the lights of the turbo-lift tunnel. The island of ice she is on perched between the ship and the turbolift. The ship is about sixty meters away where as the turbo-lift is at least twice that.
On the surface Deel and Duran begin heading towards the landing platform. When they get there the only signs they see of the monster are several large footprints scattered around the ship. Then the ground shakes as a tremor rocks the platform.

CRACK!! As the floor disappears Kro-sa loses it, scrabbling, clawing, doing all he can to find purchase while losing a si-issing scream of frustrated fury. As he hits the water all the air leaves him as his entire body, every muscle, seizes and contracts as hard as they can, almost breaking his own bones in his fit.
At some point his survival instincts kick in and take control away from his screaming mind. He hated this cold place before he got here, hated it more after he arrived, and now, now he feared it. A deep seated unreasoning hatred and fear of this abominable cold. His mind comes back to him and he finds himself on an island with some of the others. He see Arty and tries to stand, struggling mightily against his tortured frame.
**"W-w-w-where a-a-are we? Where are oddersssss?"** he asks, his teeth chattering so badly he slices open his cheek. The taste of his own blood waking him for the most part. He makes it to a kneeling position and spits a chunk of meat and blood onto the ice, shaking his head to try and force out the encroaching blackness.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

After the tremor hits, Duran looks over at Deel with a distinct look of concern.
“**This planet is becoming unstable. If you ask me, I say those Imperial nut jobs, mined too deep and too fast.**”
Duran looks at the footprints, and then looks around, and looks back at Deel.
“**Keep eyes your open; we are DEFINITELY not alone here**.”
“**Is your ship…..docked here?**” His voice lets on that this is could be a bad thing.
“ **Those droids you brought along, do you think they could board your ship? To make sure you don’t’ have any stowaways?**”

As he realizes that he´ll never make it back towards the lift, Jordan makes a wild dive to attempt to reach something stable before the floor vanishes from under him, but nothing is unfortunately within reach, and he crashes through with the rest of the squad. As he splashes into the water, a surge of cold shoots through him, and he can feel a current tugging at his rifle and the sling nearly choking him. In a sudden rush of adrenaline, he wrestles the weapon free of the current and struggles to get himself upright and above the surface. Catching glimpse of what appears to be nearby land, he exerts himself to try and reach it. Finally reaching it, he takes a few moments to catch his breath before getting on his feet.
Throwing his weapon on his back, he sees that Arty has managed to get ashore, and spots their Barabel friend crawling ashore. He hears her calling out for Antur, and he realizes that half their squad is still underwater. Figuring they´d need to act fast if they were to get the others out of there, he unhooks the drenched assault rifle from its sling, and yells towards Arty.
**"Arty! Take this and secure that ship. We´ll be needing the heat and shelter found inside. I´ll try to help the rest get out of there!"**
Throwing the massive weapon towards Arty, he hopes she isn´t to frozen to catch it. He doesn´t think she´s weak, though when it comes to sending people into freezing cold water to draw out other people, he´d rather send someone like himself or the Barabel, who´s got a little more mass on their bodies. Besides, he figures, she could use something else to focus on than how Antur is faring, and checking out that ship seems like something she could handle with ease.
He takes a quick look out at the water to try and locate someone from the squad, before jumping into the water. They were all commandos, he knew, but getting help to pull yourself ashore in deep freeze temperatures was always nice.

Time seems to slow to a crawl for Biardi as the ice crumbles beneath their feet. All he can think about is how terribly wrong this situation is. He should be in a ship soaring among the stars, not hurtling to his probable death deep beneath a planet's surface. Oddly, the free fall is almost comforting to Biardi. Having spent the majority of his life in space he's used to the feeling of weightlessness. But all thoughts of comfort are soon obliterated as Biardi crashes into the frigid water below.
Time speeds up the moment Biardi hits, going into overdrive now as everything seems to happen at once. The cold cuts through him like a knife, momentarily stunning him before he explodes into motion. The duros' arms and legs flail, desperately seeking the surface, but in his disorientation he makes little progress. Just as his lungs begin to burn and panic threatens to overwhelm him an arm brushes against him. Biardi latches unto it as only a drowning being can and is hauled to the surface by Jordan.
A few gasping breaths later some semblance of calm seeps through Biardi. He nods to the man that just saved his life, both in thanks and to let him know that he's alright now. Biardi weakly makes his way to the small island where the others wait and hauls himself onto the ice. The duros collapses, not caring about the cold just happy to be alive. He shakes, as much from the adrenaline as the temperature, while panting for air.

Arty shakes her head at the barabel "I..I..d..d...don't...k..k.know." she shivers out, looking out slowly at the cry from the water. Moving proved far more difficult than she remembered it being, far more. She felt as though not only were her clothes frozen solid blocks of ice, but her muscles and skin were of the same.
She forces herself, sure that at any moment she would hear the same cracking from her clothes with her skin, not that she'd feel it with how frozen she felt. Two fingers snag the rifle and at least stop it from falling to the water again, having to drag it to her to keep it safe. Standing was worse. She managed somehow but it was torture trying "I..c...c...c..can't.f..ff...feel my.l..l...legs." she stutters to the lizard at her side, pushing herself to stand and move towards the ship. Had to get it secured...had to..t..the warmth...the..light...
her mind was freezing over, thought was becoming more difficult and more simplistic. Warmth. Ship. Antur.

*Location: Ice Lake Island*
Arty looks out at the ship across the water. It was only twenty meters or so away but with how cold the water is it might as well be a mile. She helps Jordan pull the Duros onto the shore. His skin has turned almost a dark purple in the cold. As more of you pile onto the island you feel a slight shift from the ice. It dawns on you that this isn't an island; its an iceberg. So far there has been no sign of Antur or Jake breaking the surface of the water.
*Location: Ship Landing Bay*
Deel and Duran feel the ground shake again then go still. XO beeps hysterically across the comlink. He is beeping and tweeting so fast you can barely keep up. You think he is saying something like he can't find them or maybe he can't find it. No answer from Antur since you tried him. The power fluxes and the ice might be blocking his signal.

The panicking barabel caught her attention "K..K...K...Kro's..ssss...ssa S..Stop.. W...We have t..to get..t...to the s...ship." Her body was shaking more as she tried her best to keep from stuttering too much.
She stands and looks to the water "Wh..W...Where's A...Antur" She calls out to Jordan "A...A...And J..J..jake." she shivers and points to the ship "G...Get going..w...warmth...i..in the...s...ship." She looks to the Barabel "W..>W...We..h...have to..g...g.et w...w....warm K...Kro's.s....sssa.."

With noticeable effort Biardi rolls over and rises to his hands and knees. The duros coughs up the last of the water in his lungs and staggers to his feet. Almost falling he steadies himself with a hand on Arty's shoulder.
**"Th…th…thanks,"** he stutters between shivers.
Biardi clumsily makes his way to the edge of the iceberg and the terrified Kro-sa. He places what he hopes will be a comforting hand on the barabel's back.
**"W…we ha…h..have ttto. Weeee s…st-ay, wwwe diiie."**
With that Biardi takes a deep breath, dreading the thought of entering the icy water again almost as much as Kro-sa. Hoping to lead by example he dives into the underground lake and attempts to reach the ship and its lifesaving warmth.

**"Kro-ssssa not coward. Can Arty ssssswim widd rifle? Arty need hep?"** he asks, obviously stalling hoping to prolong the inevitable.

After heaving Biardi out of the water, Jordan takes a few moments to breathe before he realizes what he is doing.
*Don´t stop, never stop. Keep the blood flowing and muscles pumping, or you die…*
So far he has been keeping himself form shivering or stammering due to the cold, only by the willpower assembld through several decades in the field. And of course, soon it won´t matter if he allowed himself to feel the cold or not, because his body was most certainly going numb. Shaking himself to keep the blood flowing, he looked over at Kro-Sa. He thought most reptilians skins gave them some protection from the cold, but perhaps he was wrong.
**"Of course it´s warmer on the ship, now get moving! Either get over there or help me, but if you just stand around, you´ll freeze to death. That goes for both of you"**
He didn´t necessarily had to be that harsh but he had learned a long time ago that anger, even if it wasn´t really sincere, would keep you going through mostly anything. Which was why it would only be good if he could get them a little upset as well. Turning around, he searches the water for Antur or Jake, ready to jump in after them at sight.

Jordan could handle this...but she had to get the lizard to the warmth....she could come back then..yes..he's come back after the two were safe and warm. "F...F>..Find them..J..J...jordan." She orders him, less of an order and more of a plea as she looked to him, she was trying not to think of him frozen..her antur...frozen dead somewhere in the water..no..no he'd find the surface and jordan would get him to the ship, Jake too. She gulps and moves to the water, breathing deeply she jumps in and begins swimming to the ship, had to get there quick before hypothermia set in..the faster they got moving the warmer they'd get.
*Antur….Antur please be alive…* she whispered in her mind, begging anything to save the man she loved.

He feels his ire stir at the humans orders. *Humans do not order Barabel. Last humans to try were stormtroopers. Stormtroopers dead. Lots,* he thinks as he turns towards the promised warmth.
*Kro-sa is no coward. Kro-sa can cross cold water. Kro-sa can. He can… I can,* his internal litany continues as he readies himself to get back in the water. He suddenly lunges forward, running as fast and as hard as he can before jumping with all his might towards the ship...

As the cold leeches life from him Kro-sa can't resist the urge to loose another si-issing scream. It is short lived however as he swallows freezing water and chokes briefly. His mind a writhing maelstrom of utter fear torn chaos, he struggles onward, hoping to outrun the icy death that clutches at him in these waters.
*This is Hell. This is where poor warriors go when they die with dishonor. I died in the cell, tied and disgraced. This is Hell. I will spend an eternity here,* he thinks as the very will to live is slowly sucked away by the unstoppable insidious cold.

Feeling the cold creeping up on him, Jordan realized he could not hang around for much longer. If he had not caught sight of them by now, chances were high he never would. And that meant he should turn his attention towards those he could do something for. Searching frantically across the water, he noticed the others had gotten in and were headed for the ship. He sighed and swept his eyes one final time across the surface to try and find any sign of Antur or Jake, if just something telling him to stop trying.
While looking around, he paced back a few steps up the iceberg to get a good start. Taking a few quick steps to get the blood pumping he charged forward and leapt into the water.

Arty was doing all she could to keep her mind on the task at hand, that wasn't to say that it was working though. She was fighting off a cold hand of despair that had begun to seep into her heart just before she had begun the swim. Antur..had Jordan found him yet? what about Jake?
The hissing scream caught her attention, turning her head; skin beginning to turn blue from the cold, lips matching "K..Kk...Kro'sa...Y...You can..d...do it." she called out to him, "B....Be S..s...strong!" She took a deep breath as she pushed onward "W..W...We can..D...Do it!" she called out louder so that they all could hear her, so that she could hear herself and believe her words. They had to get to the ship...to get to warmth...Antur....he'd find her...he would..

Jordan jumps off the icy shoreline and back into the frigid water, landing with a painful slap. The water is unforgiving and as hard as the hull on star destroyer. He takes a minute to catch his breath, as the shock of the cold drives the air from his lungs. He penetrates the water and starts his descent into cool, clear darkness. Amidst the churning current, he spots a dark shape spinning in the wake of the tide. It's a body! He forces his body to swims deeper, reaching out to take hold it. It takes all his strength as he kicks harder and harder back towards the surface. He finally wrangles the lifeless form to the surface.
The Mandolorian fights to roll the body over, he recognizes the face, it's Antur. He is skin has turned an unhealthy blue color and more importantly, he’s noticed that Antur isn’t breathing. Jordan decides it's better to keep moving forward than try and go back. He loops one arm around the drowned mans chest and swims towards the ship with his remaining strength.

*Oh, crap*
The water was freezing him into his very bone, and Jordan couldn´t say he was very impressed with the environmental suits that they had been assigned. Of course they hadn´t been meant to be submerged, but it seemed to him the bloody things were actually absorbing the water. Finding new strength in this little annoyance, he swung his head as he saw something in the water. Despite his better instinct, he goes deeper into the water, grabbing what he now realizes is a body. Heaving both himself and the other above the surface, he recognizes Antur´s face. He also regocnizes the fact that the man isn´t breathing.
Mentally cursing the universe, he heaves Antur´s arm around himself and aims for the shore where the ship is located. He has been on enough battlefields to know he´s most likely carrying dead weight, though he´ll not let his friend just go down like this. He realizes that by now Jake must surely have suffered the same fate, but trying to save both bodies would be foolish. His primary focus right now is getting himself ashore, and then do what he can for Antur, evcen though the best he can do probably involves getting him a proper military funeral.

*Note to self, bring a knife along…this would have been much easier if I could get him out of these water-absorbant clothes…*
Feeling as though he was carrying a Wookie, Jordan pressed on. Moving slower with all this weight on him meant the cold had more time to get to him...though at this point he was barely feeling it. This was both good and bad he knew, because at one hand he wasn´t shivering and shaking, but on the other hand it meant his body was going numb. Pressing away all such thoughts, he just focused on getting to the shore. Well there he would try and get the blood flowing again...most likely by going on a rampage against the hull of that ship.

Arty was beyond cold, her mind was becoming numb as she pressed onward, who ever heard of a suit to withstand cold *not* being usable in water?! Someone should have thought of that! stupid mindless people..at least her internal conversation was helping her deal with things.
She paused again to slow and look around her at the others, hoping to see more heads behind them only to spy Jordan pulling a head..hopefully a body was attached to it. "J..jordan!" she calls back to him, looking around. She whines faintly and begins to swim back to him to help him carry the load before the two freezed to death "I...I'm Coming!"
The swim back a few paces wasn't so bad..maybe she was getting use to the cold..or numb...numb could be very likely. Once at the pair, passing the cold lizard, she moves to swing an arm of the body around her shoulders only to gasp at who it was "Antur!" she cried. Ah, sweet adrenaline to get the one she cared for to shore, to get air back into his lungs and to thaw out his blue skin "H...Hurry!" she cried to Jordan, kicking her legs with a renewed vigor.

Antur hears the loud crack and freezes in place, holding a closed hand up motioning the other to stop as well. Kro-sa starts to mutter no no no and to move! Antur looks around first to make sure Arty is ok then his group then looks around to see what made the sound.
Jordan moves first Antur turns to move as well. Opening his mouth to give the command the words are lost as the group beneath him gives way. Darkness surrounds him as he free falls into the unknown. For a moment the weightlessness reminded Antur of space, that was until the cold wet splash back to reality.
Antur forces himself to shore, no one will last long in this freezing water. At shore Antur sees the ship, looking it over Antur try`s to determine its origin. Arty`s voice calling him out snaps his attention from the ship. Shivering and cold Antur looks around "IS everyone ok?" Not waiting for an answer Antur moves to Arty`s side throwing his arms around her for shared warmth.
What Jordan says made sence "Arty! Take this and secure that ship. We´ll be needing the heat and shelter found inside. I´ll try to help the rest get out of there!" Antur nods his head in agreement.
Antur com opens but the fall must have damaged it. The voice sounds like Deel`s but much of the message is garbled. Antur realizes he is still in the water! He can hear his crew, and could swear he saw Arty. Again thoughts of moving to her for warmth flood his mind. I need to get out of the water.
Antur looks around, everything seems so blurry. A warmth flows down Antur`s face which gives him some comfort. I need to try to get to shore. Its so dark Antur attempts to call out but gets only a mouthful of water. Fear strikes Antur the warmth flowing down his face is his own blood. Antur has to get out of the water. Antur kicks with everything he has, each kick seems to drain more and more of his energy. Then darkness nothing but darkness.

Kro-sa pays no mind to the figures swimming/swarming around him in the dark waters, his thought process mostly gone at this point. Only animal instinct drives him forward. What little civility he possessed is gone, replace with the ultimate neutrality of survival at all costs. He finds his body working in ways his mind could never fathom or imagine as his tail, arms, and legs work in tandem to push him towards his goal of warmth.

Duran regards Deel’s charred, unconscious body. He leans in close and whisper something to him.
“**I’m going to borrow something, I’m sure you don’t need it, well not right now anyway.**”
Duran inhales deeply, slowly letting a long breath. He reaches out with the force, and begins to invade Deel’s mind. He easily moves through his thoughts, and recent memories. He sees where the ships been; it crewmembers, it’s life.
Duran asks the question in his mind. '**How do I pilot this wreck? Where’s the nearest habitable planet?**'
Duran smiles as the information comes to him, revealing itself effortlessly. Duran lets a long sigh.
“**That will do, Deel. That will do.**”
He unceremoniously escorts Deel of ‘his’ ship.
“**Take care, Deel. Thanks again for the ‘memories’.**”
Duran looks over at the wookie.
“**Are you coming?**”
The wookie gallops across the gangplank and into the cargo bay.
Duran calls out to the ship.
“**XO? XO! Come here you partially assembled, barely conscious piece of hardware!**”
The sounds of electronic bleating can be heard as Duran drains the droids power cells, rendering it inert and lifeless. A few moments later, the ship rumbles to life and Duran makes a planet wide comm to all the crew members still left on the planet.
“**Good afternoon, this is your captain speaking. Seeing as this planet is near its doom, I’ve taken it upon myself to be the first to evacuate all key personnel. I wish you all well, and remember, it’s nothing personal, its business. No, wait…I take that back. This was personal. Duran, signing off.**”
In seconds, the ship leaves the planet’s atmosphere, and then disappears into hyperspace.

Biardi kicks as quickly as he can as he rises up the corridor. Judging by the ache in his lungs he needs to find air quickly. Hopefully he can reach a non-submerged part of the ship soon.

They were nearing the ship enough to see Biardi dive down, at least one of them had gotten to the safety to the ship, she wondered idly how bad it was down there.
"A..Almost there!" she calls out to kro'sa and Jordan, just a bit farther...and they could dive "How..w....will we..b...bring him...i...inside?"

Biardi breaks the surface of the water. He looks around but sees little in the darkness. Kro-sa pops up next to him gasping for air and feeling generally miserable. Arty and Jordan fight and struggle to pull Antur through the airlock and up the flooded tunnels. The water has started growing warmer as you get deeper inside the ship. Well not really warm but a lot less cold. The ship gives a loud groan as it shifts and settles. The ship is leaning at about a 45 degree angle, now that the ice that was holding it in place has started to melt who knows how long it will stay that way. There is only one way to go and that is up towards the engine room, where the reactors are.

Pulling and swimming and fighting to get to the top finally proves fruitful as she broke to air inside the ship, pulling Antur's body with her to get his head back above water, she hoped that he hadn't breathed any in..she hoped he was breathing at that.

He turns to look at the icy hell he just came from and sees the others and finds himself confused as to why they are in the water, himself not remembering the swim until he concentrates on it. In a rush he reaches down and sinks claws into clothing, bodily hauling Antur's limp weight from the water and onto the relatively dry deck.

Rather happy to feel Arty and Kro-Sa take Antur´s body off him, Jordan crawls himself out of the water and takes a few moments to catch his breath. After settling down, he starts to pull his wet envirosuit off, figuring it does more harm than good while soaked. Once they got off this blasted planet, he´d never leave an urban area witout the protection of his armor. Once he had paid Tipoca city a visit, that is.
Getting out of the suit, he grabs his rifle from Arty and slings it on his back. Giving her a reassuring pat on the shoulder, he starts to make his way "up" in the ship. He hadn´t been paying very much attention to which part of the ship was submerged, though he hoped he was headed for the cockpit.

Arty emerges looking to Kro'sa with thankful eyes to have Antur's body out of the water. the question was now, dare she take a small time to get him breathing again or wait until they were further in? She wasn't that skilled...she knew the basics to CPR but..was that enough?
She looks up to the others "Does...Does anyone know something to help???" She was still in a bit of a panic, her body still shaking as she removed her suit as she saw Jordan do then quickly removed Anturs, tapping his cheeks and listening for his heart..any breathing at all. "Antur.." she whines, what did she do?? she wasn't a medic..ugh why hadn't she taken more classes!

Jordan halted his ascent for a moment and took a deep breath. He wasn´t looking forward to this, but he figured he´d better get it out of the way as quick as possible. Once again, he´d rather have her mad at him than focusing on Antur. He had seen enough fresh recruits break down their first time in the field to know it never made anything better.
**"The only thing we can do for him is make sure he gets the military burial he deserves. From what I can guess, he is likely suffering from hypothermia, drenched lungs, and possibly broken bones from the fall. And he hasn´t been breathing since I fished him out of the water. In this condition, very few people could do anything at all"**
He had heard stories about miracles worked by Jedi healers during the war, and he figured nothing short of that would bring Antur back alive. While talking, he gently grabbed Antur´s wrist and neck, quickly feeling for a pulse. He was certain he wasn´t going to find any lifesigns, but he had been wrong before.
**"Let´s figure out a way to grab the others and get off this planet. There´ll be plenty of time to mourn in hyperspace"**
He hoped he didn´t sound too cold, but he had been around death for so long that it´s effect on him had been severely reduced. As he resumed his climb, his thoughts drifted back to one of his earliest camapigns, about two decades ago. A brief image flashed before his eyes, the face of a young girl with long, blonde hair, eyes blue as the sky, and a wide smile on her face. Then the image was replaced by another, where the shining hair had turned all messy and dirty, the smile replaced by a bloody mess, and the eyes locked in a lifeless gaze.

Biardi almost collapses in relief when he is finally able to get out of the water but manages to remove his sopping wet environment suit. After catching his breath he helps the others pull Antur up to the dry portion of the ship.
The duros' jaw drops in shock which quickly turns to anger at Jordan's cavalier attitude. In perhaps the first time any of the squad has heard him raise his voice in anger Biardi shouts at Jordan.
**"I know there may not be much hope but we can't just give up on him, blast it! The least we can do is try!"**
Biardi takes a deep breath and closes his eyes, trying to revive his normally calm disposition. He knows it's been a terrible day and everyone's nerves are frayed. Losing his cool won't help the situation. After one more breath he reopens his eyes and seems slightly more serene.
**"I only know the very basics but I'll give it a shot. Unless you have any training?"**

Arty stared from the body of her love to the soon to be dead body of a loud-mouthed idiot. it was cold, they were far below the surface and he thought it would be best to say something like *that*?? to *her*???
She saw red.
Amazing, anger was actually making her feel warm. But it wouldn't help..no...they needed to get him breathing again. After..yes..after.
Gritting her teeth to keep from saying anything she moves to Antur's mouth, tilting his head back just so and pries his mouth open enough to check to make sure the throat was clear. "Biardi, get ready to pump his heart if it's not beating. Ten counts." She orders before taking a deep breath, sealing her mouth over his to push air to his lungs; thank the stars the captain made everyone in the old team take CPR.
*Treat Injury +4. With a +4 count I would imagine that's basic knowledge of cpr and how to put a band-aide on a cut. =P I'll FP it, they're all working together for this so it should be aiding each other right?*

Darkness.....
No not darkness, but space. The swirl of stars planets and ships. This is combat a fight for survial. Spinning round and round Antur spirals through waves of enemy fighters. Tie fighters the empire had found them they where on them now. Time to make a stand maybe the last stand. Bolts of energy fly back and forth across the battle field of space. Waves of Ties come many fly past but yet many more are shoot down.
Its so cold, the ships hull must have been damaged or else the ships life support system would maintain a constant temperature. More ships have entered the fray, this time allies more Y-wings and head hunters to battle the empire. Waves more tie fighters come and go. The ships dance across the field of space light by the fire works of cannons and missiles.
Light .......
A flash of light Antur`s fighter is hit, but I am not done yet. The battle spread across a vast area in this region with the slower capital ships now adding even more firepower to the fight. Spinning into another spiral Antur twirls into an upward angle only to quickly reverse slamming his ships guns towards the enemy. Another flash of light this time the ie as Antur moves his ship through the explosion.
"Blue two this is Blue one. Spin around to my position we have another wave of signals. Hit them hard before we are flanked."
Blue one? That sounded like Foster, that can`t be .... he is dead!
Training takes over Antur`s ship damaged but functional limps into attack position. Waves upon wave of ship closes blasting a hail of fire. Antur`s ship jolts hard as it takes another hit. Warnings erupt all over his console. Almost done one last thing to do.
The ship spirals this time mostly involuntarily. Antur works hard to maintain the proper angle as he forces more speed out of the engines. Into a shower of explosion Anturs ship crashes into an incoming Tie. Darkness .....
Light ....
Antur`s lungs fill with air, as he expels water from them. Blinded at first Antur is confused not sure where he is. Shaking his head Antur see`s Arty`s teary eyed face. With a smile Antur pulls her close for a kiss.
Looking around the room Antur realizes they are not alone. "By the stars I am sure glad it was you Arty giving me mouth to mouth and not one of them." Antur try`s to get up but fails to find the strength. Sensing his intent to stand Arty applies just enough force to hold him down. Still not entirely sure of where he is Antur states "Status report."

The cough had her moving off quickly to help him roll to his side and let the water be expelled, rubbing his back to help calm his poor body. Relief washed through her, gladly kissing him in relief, over and over and around his face. He was okay! and trying to move...
Gentle hands push him back "don't get up, you've been out like that for a while you need to rest." She sighs and looks to Biardi with a grin of relief. Alive and trying to be strong "we're in a ship..found it, we fell from the ice." She sighs and looks over to Jordan.
Jordan. Telling her to not hope to find him, not to hope that he'd be okay, not to hope that he'll be alive.
*Jordan.

Feeling the cold stiffness in his body as he moved, Jordan raised his hand and caught Arty´s fist in it. Holding it for a few moments, he looked down at Antur, seeing the man really stir, talk and - finally - breathe. Hoping she would not try to punch him again, he let go of Arty and reached for a pocket in his belt. He was very surprised, to say the least, that Antur was indeed alive, though of course he was happy. Not as happy as he would be when they all got out of here though. He produced a small injector from his belt and pushed Antur´s head gently to the side. At least when people were alive he knew how to treat them.
**"One man lost, and the rest of us have seen better days. Hopefully, this is going to hurt like hell, and in that case your nerve system hasn´t been completely destroyed by the cold"**
While he talked he placed the injector on Antur´s neck, and shot it into him. It was a shot of adrenaline, enough to get anyone on their feet, though he hadn´t been kidding. It *would* hurt like hell.

Deel realizes to late that he was had. He remembers Duran turning on him his eyes black and the energy leaping from his hands, and then blackness. *"Is this what death feels like?"* He thinks to himself as his body hits the deck.
A little while later he awakes feeling like he had just stuck his head in the engines of the Voidstalker. "I feel like I just chewed on a power cable." He says to himself. His eyes open and looks around. "Yep I am alive." He sets up and looks for the ship. It was gone. "XO you there?" He doesn't see the droid anywhere. He activates his comm. "Antur, Arty, anyone we have a problem. Duran has turned on me and taken the ship. Over. Repeat Duran attacked me and taken the ship. over." He sets up and finds his blaster and checks it for damage. If he couldn't get to the others or find them away off this planet they are borked big time.

The ship shudders and bucks and your stomachs drop as the ship lurches down wards. It only lasts a second before settling. Red warning lights start flashing in all the corridors and air is filled with warning bells. You make your way further into the ship moving through half flooded hallways. Doubling back when you reach a collapsed room or blocked passage. You have come across several signs all written in some unknown language. The heat is getting higher the further you go towards the reaction. You have reached some sort on large blast door, usually these lead to cargo area, hangers, reactors and things like that on a ship this size.

Kro-sa watches the small human and larger human perform some sort of ceremony after the dead human came back to life. *Celebratory maybe?* he wonders as he decides it doesn't matter and continues onward into the ship, shedding his drenched clothing. The instant warmth and freedom of movement suit him just fine as he dashes through the corridors. The ship rocking and settling almost makes him seize up in fear of being submersed again, but its almost over as soon as it starts. As he reaches the blast door he looks for any obvious way to open it, imagining he can feel heat radiating through it.

There is an control panel but it looks like it was fried by some sort of electrical charge or ion blast. There is a maintenance access hatch near the floor. There are two large locking clamps near the top of the large blast door. The ship creaks and groans. In the distance you can hear metal buckling.
*Location: Landing Pad*
Deel doesn't get any sort of response. Doing a few mental calculations he comes to the conclusion that he needs a stronger signal to break through the interference. In front of him he sees the Imperial command center which has a very large communication suite on top.

Arty was pissed that she hadn't been able to hit him, deciding later that she'd try again, or get help in it from the Captain. Standing she helps Antur up and motions after Kro-sa "come on...it doesn't sound like we're going to be able to be here long." She says looking around the ship and the sounds it was making.
Moving quickly Arty joins the other at the blast door, looking for a past. She pauses at the maintenance hatch "I think I can fit there...maybe I can get the door open from the other side."

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-10-18 15:02:06)

Jordan looked at the door, his mind immediately closing in one solution before he noticed the small hatch in the floor. Figuring if anyone should try to get down there, it should be Arty. The rest of them would probably get stuck somewhere, and he *really* wouldn´t like that. What worried him though, was how much time they did actually have. The sounds the ship was making, and that garbled transmission he had received from Deel made him think that even though they might not have a blaster to their heads, they should move as quick as possible.
**"Sounds like a good idea. Call out in case you don´t find a way to get behind the door or open it, and I will invent a slightly more extreme and permanent opening. I´m not sure what´s going on with this ship, but it doesn´t sound good"**
As he moves over to help open the hatch, Jordan starts to look at the door and the structure around it, trying to determine if it would stand up to an explosive blast. Luckily, he had scavenged a couple of professionally made charges from their raid on the Trandoshan slave station, which produced directed blasts that would hopefully not do too much damage to the surrounding area.

However his mood is quickly sobered by thoughts of the squad mate who didn't make it, Jake. The duros takes a moment of silence for their fallen friend before the ominous sounds of metal fatigue emanating from the ship snap the squad into action. Once they reach the blast doors Biardi studies it along with the others.
**"I agree time may be of the essence but I'm not sure explosives would be such a great idea. That should be our last resort. The electronics may be fried but maybe we can bypass the lock manually. I'll give it a shot while Arty scopes out the maintenance hatch."**
Biardi spreads his tools out next to the door and searches for a way to open it.

Biardi examines the panel Kro-sa busted open, the wires have been exposed and can now be quickly and easily accessed. Arty pops open the maintenance hatch and starts poking around inside the door mechanics. She quickly coordinates her efforts with Biardi. Working as a team they finds and open the manual release mechanism. The door doesn't budge however. Jordan standing back searching for places to put the shaped charges sees the issue. The locking clamps won't open and allow the door to slide. He quickly attaches the charges and orders everyone back away from the door.
<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">BOOM</span>
The ship shakes and rocks from the explosion. The shaped charges do exatly what they were supposed to do and the locking clamps shatter, the door groans as it starts to open slowly. After a mere three inches the door grind to a halt.

Arty calls back as she works through her side to talk and coordinate with Biardi for the best chance that the door will open. Figuring everything quickly enough she frowns at what doesn't seem to be there.
The sound of the door opening.
Sighing "That worked well" she calls behind her scooting back out to see...holy hell he was actually gonna blow it. Eyes wide she moves to Antur, taking his hand as she moves him back a bit out of the way.
BOOM
Yes she squealed like a little girl at the shock of the sound, would she hit someone if they mentioned it? yes. best if they didn't.
The door moved...a grand total of three inches.

**"Hey, at least we can peek through now. I can go at it again if you like, though this thing seems quite robust"**
Pressing himself up against the door, he tries to peek inside and see what´s on the other side. Just in general, but also in terms of control panels they might access wirelessly or poke at with a metal rod, or stuff that might be blocking the door from the other side. Just for the sake of it, he applies a bit of pressure against the door to see if it will budge. Their combined efforts might have loosened enough stuff holding the door in place.

Hey picks himself up off the ground and heads for the Imperial Comm system. This would push his signal to them or he would blow the whole thing up. It was at least worth a try. He opens up the panel and checks to make sure everything is still working and sets it up for the comm signal he and his friends used. "Antur, Arty this is Deel. Duran has attacked me and taken the ship over." *"This has got to work."* He thinks to himself. If it didn't he was dead.

The three boys put all their muscle into prying the doors open. They slowly start to slide further and further apart. Between Arty and Biardi's hard work at opening the manuel release and Jordan destruction of the locking clamps. Kro-sa's muscles finish the job and before you is a large room that looks like a hybrid between a medical lab and an engineers bay.
This room has been heavily damaged by the crash and what look like signs of a fire fight. There are several ancient looking cryo-chambers. Two are cracked open and heavily damaged. You can see shadows of bodies inside through the darkened canopies. The third one is wide open and empty. There are also several bodies around the room. A few storm troopers and an Imperial officer.
The engineering side of the room is in utter chaos lights flashing, all sorts of beeping, control panels flash warning messages rapidly. A large radiation symbol is flashing near the ships reactor. The temperature in this section is rising and you have started to sweat.
*Location: Imperial Control Room*
This looks much how you remember lots of damaged equipment and blood. Deel quickly sets to work diagnosing the comms system. He will need to scavange a few parts from some of the other systems but he thinks he can jury-rigg it together.

She curses softly and looks back to them "Guys! There's a radiation leak I think from the reactor! We can't stay here long!" She turns to look around the room. Maybe there was another hatch they could get through to the ice burg instead of having to swim again through that water...maybe even a raft..or a pod they could pilot. something.

He is instinctively drawn towards the flashing lights and sounds at the engineering section of the room. Walking up next to Arty he also notices the large radiation symbol flashing on the screen.
**"I´m not sure our suits gives any protection against radiation, but you´re right that there might be some radiation suits around here somewhere"**
Walking closer to the controls, he tries to see if there´s anything he can do, like send the reactor into a shutdown. He had done it at times during the war with his commandos, but the problem was that it took a few minutes, and he wasn´t sure they had that. Of course, that wouldn´t stop him from trying, while the others might be able to find some other way to get out. Bringing out his tools he set to work as fast as he possibly could.

"Jordan..." she says softly eyes still looking up "I think we have a droid watching us.." she mumbles to him, nodding her head very slowly to where she had see the metal flash.
Droids were fine, but droids that had been reprogrammed to kill or that were programmed to protect the craft would prove very difficult...and it wasn't exactly easy to tell what kind of droid was stalking them at the moment.

*Oh crap…like I´m not short on time for this already…*
Jordan felt Arty grab him, and turned to look at where she had seen something. This *shabla* mission was getting better and better all the time, and some part of him just wanted to rig all his explosives to the reactor core, set the timer, and get out of there as fast as possible. That wasn´t really an option though. He gave her a quick pat on the shoulder as he sifted through his tool kit to try and find the fusion cutter.
**"If a droid is running around here, it is most likely some kind of mechanic or maintenance droid. This was an imperial base after all, and the Empire has never been keen on using battle droids. Lesson from the war I guess"**
Of course, there was nothing saying that this ship had anything to do with the Empire. It may just as well have been here since the war, perhaps even be a CIS vessel. And those guys had been very keen on producing fighting droids. Another flashback passed before his eyes, of insectoid droids coming rolling like wheels at him, then halting to unfold a shielded pack of heavy blaster cannons that even hardened commandos knew to respect. But the most important thing now was to stop the reactor from going critical, and if he did that, they could hopefully take a moment of rest in a shielded and warm environment, something they all needed.
As he worked though, he kept casting glances towards the darker corners of the room, just in case.

Arty nods her head, she couldn't shake the feeling though that something just wasn't right, if it wasn't a battle droid then why was it hiding up there? Mechanic droids would have a station...and it'd likely hide someplace else lower to the ground, even those protocol droids wouldn't hide up there would they? Then again...could battle droids get up there?
Following after him she takes his rifle to guard his back, hopefully it was unnecessary but it was better to be safe in this case. At least then he could get the reactor under control.

Examining the cryo-chambers reveals some disturbing information. Most of the chambers are obviously damaged and their occupants long dead. However, one is still functional...and empty. Even worse there's a much fresher looking corpse lying close to the open tube. Biardi searches the body and discovers the man was probably one the miners who initially discovered the ship. The man also has a name tag. It reads Duran.
Biardi starts to get a very bad feeling as his thoughts whirl. He looks up at the others from his position over the corpse.

Deel looks around at some of the other consuls in the area.*"Maybe I can steal from these to get this working."* He thinks to himself. He goes over the comm system again to make sure he didn't miss anything. It was going to be interesting considering the beating he took to get this thing working but he had to try. After a few more minutes of rewiring and jury rigging to get it work he tries again. "Antur, Arty this Deel can you read me over." If this didn't work he was screwed.

The droid drops down from the bulkhead where it was lurking. It leaps down spinning in the air to land on its feet before you. The skeletal frame gives it a sense of grace not seen in most droids. It's chasis has seen some damage and some recent repair. It's vocabulator hisses something that sounds almost demonic. With a snap hiss sounds a red glowing blade lights up from a mount built into the right arm.

Jordan wasn´t too happy about the condition of the reactor systems. The thing was in bad enough shape that the built-in failsafes and security systems he would normally use to shut it down wasn´t of much help, he´d have to go in manually to get this thing down. As he starts to pack up his tools to get moving, something else catches his attention. A solid "thump" as if something heavy landed on the ground behind him, and then an all too familiar sound. For a moment he almost hoped that they would have stumbled upon a Jedi Knight in hiding after the war, but as he caught the color of the pulsating energy blade in his peripheral vision, he knew they were in trouble.
Dropping his tools to the ground, he turned around pulling his pistol from its holster. He didn´t hold many delusions that the thing was going to be friendly, but after all it hadn´t attacked on sight, so maybe he should restrain himself from doing the same. He kept his finger close on the trigger though, ready to fire at a moment´s notice.

Kro-sa freezes again, watching the droid and debating on trying to circle it. He'd heard Stormtroopers speak in terrified whispers of a being in all-black with a glowing red blade, then heard the same troopers speak of the figure with reverence and almost love. He'd always assumed the man was more myth than reality, and wondered if this being was before him now. His mind races back to the tales of un-winnable battles swayed by one red blade, and of hardened troops slaughtered for their failures. *Is this a droid or or the abomination the Stormtroopers spoke of?

Biardi can finally start to feel some of the warmth creeping back into his frozen bones. However he doesn't let the relief cause him to relax. Instead he maintains his focus upon the droid, ready to fire at the first sign of hostile action.
Considering the unknown language the droid addressed them with it occurs to Biardi that it might not understand Basic. He has a pretty good understanding of Binary but certainly can't reproduce it with his own vocal cords. Doubting it'll work but not seeing anything to lose he tries speaking in Durese. Basic is undoubtedly more widespread but Durese still sees considerable use as a trade language thanks to the numerous systems the space faring Duros have explored.

Jordan didn´t catch on the idea of trying out various languages on the droid. It wasn´t a Basilisk in front of him, and the idea that Kaminoans would build a battle droid seemed too far fetched to even consider for him. Given that his linguistics skills didn´t expand further than that, he placed his second hand on the gun, steadying his grip on the weapon. At least that was a language most creatures understood.

The droids photo receptors scan over all of you. It doesn't respond to any of the attempts to communicate.

Simply reacting, he was on his feet the moment Kro-Sa started forward. As he saw the massive warrior crash into the droid, he lowered his own pistol and hurled himself onto the droid, trying to weigh it down and restrict its movement.

Jordan and Kro-sa rush the droid in an unconventional maneuver to pin it to the ground, thereby minimizing the chance that one of them will be attacked. It’s taken quickly off it’s feet and restrained by the sheer girth of its opponents. The combined weight of the Barabel and human proven to be somewhat effective, as the droid flails, attempting to evenly slice the intruders into wafer thin sections. The constant thrashing has managed to catch Jordan in the left arm. The droid drags the saber down the length of his limb from the shoulder all the way down passed his elbow. The smell of perfectly cooked flesh is starting to get a reaction from Kro-sa, who briefly has thoughts of home. Jordan yells out, wishing now that the droid had just cut the arm off. The burn blisters and persistently throbs with unimaginable pain.
Antur stands outside the melee action, biding his time, waiting for an opportune moment to take a clear shot. Though he realizes that with friends entangled in the scuffle, he finds it increasingly difficult to take his shot. He aims and then hesitates, aim and then hesitates. He hears Jordan cry out and begins to feel the desperation of the situation. Something has to be done and done soon or no one will make it out, not in one piece anyway

It bucks wildly in her grip, spraying automatic laser fire at the droid…and at her comrades. Kro-sa, Jordan and the droid all suffer laser bolt burns as the area is pelted thoroughly bright red beams of burst energy weapons fire. Almost immediately, Zerah lets go of the trigger, swinging the rifle away from friend and foe.
Everyone scatters. Kro-sa and Jordan surprised by the blaster fire, dive into different directions, looking for immediate cover. The droid regains its senses, performs a backwards somersault, and moves back and out of the way.

Crying out in pain and fury as the lightsaber rakes his arm Jordan stamps down even harder on the metal body beneath him. He was furious enough now that he felt he could rip the bloody thing in half with his bare hands, had he been given the chance. Then suddenly Arty appears at the side of them, and as he sees her raise his weapon, he starts to cry out towards her, but is too late.
Even as the blast bolt starts to fly into the air he throws himself into a dive, but is turned into a clumsy half-roll as two energy lances scratches his body, one on the arm and another in the side. Scrambling to his feet, the Mandalorian veteran bites down his fury and raises his pistol in a determined one-handed grip against the droid. Little else existed now than the war machine and its glowing energy blade. He started to walk towards Arty, without ever taking the eyes off the droid, and he held out his free hand towards her, hopefully she would understand he was insisting on getting his weapon back.
Sending killing glares its way, Jordan kept his weapon trained on the droid. If it as much as moved, he would shoot it. And once Arty gave him his rifle back, he would also shoot it, only more times and with more power. Hissing between his teeth he almost wished the droid to be programmed to understand the Mandalorian tounge.

Dropping his pistol to the ground, he raised the rifle to his shoulder and placed his free hand under the weapon to steady it.

He moves again, striking lightning fast at the droid, not hearing or ignoring Biardi's very good advice.
He comes in mid-height, claw slashing for the droid's torso, knowing the droid will evade it. His second attack is his teeth slamming closed a mere hair's breath from the droid's tortured throat.

The droid dances lightly out of the lizards way with a grace that belies it's metal body. It seems to anticipate the burst of fire from Jordan as it uses Kro-sa as a meat shield. The Mando curses as he pulls his shot to avoid splattering Barabel across the room. The wild shots hits one of the control panels and klaxons start to ring in the reactor room. That cannot be a good sign. Biardi grits his teeth and waits for his shot, seeing an opening as the droid's attention is divided between Jordan and Kro-sa. With a careful squeeze of the trigger he fires, the red bolt connects with the droids sword arm causing a shower of sparks. It's blood red photo-receptors seem to focus on the Duros cataloging him as a threat. Time seems to slow as the squad leader makes his move.

Kro-sa lashes out again dealing another devastating blow to the droid. His mighty claws rend durosteel like paper. The droid's vocabulator issues a sounds that almost sounds like laughter. Then a large explosion rocks the ship as the Barabel is blown across the room. The whole ship shudders and shifts throwing everyone off their feet.

While Kro-sa lays in a smoldering heap collapsed against the wall, two and two come together. *Small human! Arty shot me! Why?* he thinks as he remembers offering to carry the rifle earlier, then seeing Jordan fire it at the droid after being shot with it. Arty had the rifle when he, Jordan and the droid were hit. He remembers watching Jordan fight to control the rifle even after bracing. *Small human too small,* he thinks as he stands. He walks over to the dead Stormtroopers and picks up one of their carbines, which looks like a toy in his hands. Bleeding profusely and still smoking from the explosion he walks to Arty and offers her the carbine, **"Here, sssssmall hoo-man. Dis one ssssmall like you. You no ssssshoot Kro-ssssa with sssssmall gun. No more gunssss dat are too big, oh-tay?"** he says before slumping slightly from his wounds.

Arty was glad that the thing was dead or something, concerned about the two in the middle of it all but glad they were able to walk. She made an appearence to begin ushering everyone towards...something...they needed to get to a safer area before the core exploded.
"Here, sssssmall hoo-man. Dis one ssssmall like you. You no ssssshoot Kro-ssssa with sssssmall gun. No more gunssss dat are too big, oh-tay?" She blinks at Kro-sa as she takes the blaster, chuckling faintly "sorry about that Kro-sa..Jordan....forgive me?" she asks while she ushers them towards Antur. "we gotta find a way out of here and quick, and someplace safe where we can find a way out of this hell hole."

Jordan backsteps and covers his face with his arm to shield him from the heat and shockwave of the droid exploding, but in combination with the large explosion rocking the ship, he is thrown flat on his belly. As soon as thing settle around them, he scrambled to his feet, looking around to see that the rest of them were ok. Placing the sling around his neck and shoulder again, he left the heavy rifle to hang behind his right side.
**"Don´t worry about it Arty. But when we get off this hellhole, I´m taking you to the range. I think you´re right though, we should get out of here quickly. After that explosion, I´m not too keen on trying to shut down the reactor anymore"**
Taking a few moments to gather himself, and wipe the blood from the small scratches he had recently acquired, he looked around the floor for the pieces of the droid. It was particularly two pieces he was interested in: The droid´s head, to extract whatever data might be found inside its brain, and the appendage that had contained the lightsaber, a tool that could probably help them a lot in getting out of this place.

The self destruct on the droid seemed to do a thorough job of obliterating anything salvageable. It has been reduced to shrapnel most of which resides in Kro-sa's scaly hide and Jordan's armor. The alarms and lights start to increase in tempo. Seems like you have a decision that needs to be made quickly either safely shut down the reactor or try and escape from the lowest level of the mine and make it a safe distance away before a capital ship's engine goes critical in a planet's polar cap.

**"How we sssshut down reactor?"** Kro-sa asks as he moves towards the thing, unworried about the radiation, knowing his thick hide can handle it. He stops back at the dead stormtrooper and begins fishing a comlink out of his belt, but stops when he sees all the utility belt holds. He quickly strips the belt off, then says, **"Hoo-manssss talk Kro-ssssa drough it?"**

Biardi gets a sinking feeling when the droid begins to laugh. Something about it reminds him of an old holovid...Then the droid explodes and Biardi has just enough time to shield his eyes from the flash.
The duros lurches forward, concern for Jordan and Kro-sa stamped all over his face. When the two stand up under their own power he breathes a sigh of relief. Unfortunately that relief is short-lived as one glance at the reactor shows it's about to blow. As the adrenaline slowly drains from his system Deel's words coming crashing back to Biardi, obliterating any sense of relief he might have felt.
"If this thing goes off the minimum safe distance might be in orbit. We should at least see if there's anything we can do to stop it."
With that said he rushes to the nearest functioning console and studies the read outs.

*Oh for the love of…*
It was obvious that the suggestion to get out of here had passed over the head of some of the squad members, and whether it was panic or just simple stubbornness, they seemed bent on trying to stop the reactor for going boom. He knew they had to be running out of time, but he also liked the his squadmates enough that he didn´t want to see them blown to bits. The Barabel was a little iffy, but for all his lack of intelligence he seemed to have enough guts that Jordan couldn´t just dismiss him.
Breaking out his toolkit again, he started to head for the main parts of the reactor.
**"Don´t sweat it Biardi, this thing has passed way beyond the point where you can do anything useful from there. So why don´t you just get out of here while me and our scaly friend here takes care of it?"**
Really, the Mandalorian veteran wondered how much use the Barabel could be of, but he remembered somewhere in the back of his head that the lizards came from a heavily radiated planet and was somewhat resilient to radiation, which he was sure the reactor was emitting tons of. Problem was, without the protection of his armor, *he* didn´t have any such resilience. Taking a deep breath, he started to search for the fuel supply system for the reactor.

Deel clears and listens to the incoming transmission of a shuttle heading to the mining station. "Damn! It is probably Imperial." He switches to his comm link. "Ah guys I got some good news and bad news. There is a shuttle coming. The bad news is that it is most likely Imperial. Over." Deel hoped his friends where figuring away back to him. Cause he wouldn't be able to fight his way out of this one. He continues to do adjustments to the hyper space transmitter and wonders if the stations senors where still working.

**Location: Mining Station 25 central control**
Sensors reveal that it is a Lambda class shuttle. Shuttle is pinging as ***"Confessor"***. You finish your calibration of the hyperwave transmitter. It's boards light up green and start powering up linking to the holo-net. The shuttle will be arriving in the next fifteen minutes.
**Location: Crashed Ship Reactor Room**
Biardi rushes over to one of the few remaining consoles. With a few quick strokes of his fingers he has pulled up the reactor controls. He sees that the reactor is on the verge of a catastrophic meltdown. The primary issue seems to be the fact the cooling feeds have been closed down. Jordan starts searching for the fuel supply system. He locates it fairly quickly. It seems to have suffered from some collateral damage and is feeding back into the reactor. You could slow the reaction if you could release the fuel somehow.

"Antur we have incoming Imp. shuttle in 15 minutes. Over." putting the comm link away Deel starts to figure out the best course of action. If the Imps found him a Rebellion Tech and Officer on this station he would most likely be shot sense he belonged to the Voidstalkers that had stung the Empire more then once.

Finding what he was looking for rather quickly, Jordan kicks away some junk on the ground and gets to work. No surprise, he had never seen a reactor quite like this before. Never mind, they all had their own little design quirks, but tended to shut down all the same. Breaking out some more manual tools, he tries to cut the flow of fuel that is feeding into the reactor. If nothing else, doing do could prevent the accumulation of even more fuel in the reactor, most likely dampening the blast somewhat. Of course, that didn´t matter a single bit to him, given that he´d most likely be incinerated the moment things went boom.
Wrestling a stuck coupling loose, he hated the fact that he had to do this manually, but the computer seemed limited in its uses, and he wasn´t about to use powered cutting tools near a pipe carrying highly explosive starship fuel. He threw a small wrench at Kro-Sa, at least hoping the lizard knew what it was.
**"All right, get to it. We need to release these valves and cut the fuel supply. Given that you are the one least likely to die if some of this radiated shit leaks out on us, why don´t you take the one closer to the main line?"**

Between Jordan and Arty's expertise they manage to divert the fuel back out of the reactor. The temperature in the core stops rising as quickly. It is still in the critical range but is not pushing any further. The ship shudders again as the fuel reverts back to the engines and the roar with an increase vigor. You hear and feel loud crashes coming from the outside of the ship. You imagine large chunks of the ceiling breaking apart from the increased burn of the engines.
Antur answers up to Arty's idea of looking for a way out.

Kro-sa easily catches the thrown wrench and does as instructed, then listens to Arty telling him about the standard blink code for broken components. He moves deeper in looking for the flashing lights indicating failing systems. He finds one, recognizing the 'Hey, I'm broken' bit, and does his best to reroute its workload or juryrig it to temporarily keep working. He looks around and spots several more of the same lights, noting his next stops. He only wished he could read the language displayed, then he might actually know what he was fixing.

Finally done with the fuel system, Jordan wipes a brow of sweat from his forehead. Good call back there taking off his suit, it would have killed him working in that thing. As the ship shudders and he hears the crashes from outside, he calls back to the others.
**"Hey Biardi, that screen reading anything better now? I would just love it if the automated systems could kick in and we could spend our time doing better things. Like trying to get some control of this ship. I think someone should head back the way we came and see if the route to the cockpit is accessible"**

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **Frost** (2010-12-20 09:02:43)

Kro-sa's excellent job of replacing or rerouting damaged junctions and panels seems to have paid off. Machinery whirrs to life and red light blink to green. Biardi's fingers fly across the control panel pulling up reading and data. The glow from the red alarm lights make his normally blue features seem purple as he translates the information flying across the screen.
**"The cooling tanks have been shut down manually. If we can get them restarted that should allow us to shut her down safely."**
The lights start to flicker and you can hear ancient systems powering up. A shower of sparks erupts from one panel as the optical capacitors are overloaded from the sudden surge of power. Another control board hisses and pops. It's immediately followed by the smell of burned electronics. It goes dead, and a near visible trail of smoke is seen trickling from the back panel
Biardi looks around for a second, he accesses a control panel that hasn't been fried or overloaded and starts typing away at the command keys. He looks up from the panel with a look of realization.
**"The coolant tanks are underneath the floor. I don't know why I didn't think of that before. These ancient ships had a configuration very different from our modern ones; our designs moved the coolant tanks to another part of the vessel altogether. You should be able to access it from a maintenance hatch over there behind that console."**

Kro-sa wastes no time hurrying to the said console and ripping off the hatch, throwing it casually to the side as he sticks his head and shoulders into the hole thankful he doesn't need a light. He draws his hydrospanner and fusion cutter, searching for the shut off valve that threatens their lives. A continual si-issing can be heard as he voices his displeasure without speaking. As he finds it, he sets to work turning the coolant loose.

She sighs and moves over to the boys, looking over their shoulders to watch for signs of turning the ship off better.
She wondered if the ship would be sturdy enough for them to even fly it...if they could get it out of the cavern, then they'd have it and Imps wouldn't....and they'd get out of there faster.

The coolant systems come online and begin to return the vital fluid to the already weaken ancient reactor. Biardi begins the complicated process of shutting it down. The roar of the engines dies away as he does. Outside you can continue to hear large chunks of ice falling and splashing into the lake. The lights flicker back out as the reactor finally shuts down. The ship now seems eerily silent.

Gathering together his tools, Jordan walked over to the computer console. He hoped he could use it to diagnose the rest of the ship, to make sure if there was any possible chance of using it to actually fly. He could fix most things given enough time, provided they were only broken, but he couldn´t rebuild a starship engine from scratch.

*Maintenance Bay - Antur, Arty, Kro-sa*
You spend a few moments going over the speeders. They are very old but seem serviceable they just need a little TLC and some general maintenance (lube, oil, filter change). The large pile of parts and tools should help you accomplish this. The lights are somewhat dim in the bay; in fact you’ve noticed the lights have been getting steadily, lower and lower for a little while now. The ship creaks and metal moans as it attempts to shift its position it’s icy tomb. Then without warning, the ship shudders violently, like a Bantha going through death throes. It bucks and turns, and you think the that ice may be giving way beneath it, letting it slip deeper and deeper into the planet. The lights flicker and then go out. You sit, to avoid falling, in the dark, empty bay; the faint echoes of the ship grinding against ice, resonate quietly in the workshop. The residual clanging of tools and parts linger for a moment, and then the ship is silent again. A few minutes the lights flicker on. You feel impending doom being aboard this dying vessel; it waits impatiently for its final death. A sense of anxiety begins to creep up on you, as you realize you are not aboard a star ship, you are aboard the galaxy’s largest floating grave. You quickly get back your task, with the renewed goal of getting off this dying planet.
*Engineering - Jordan &amp; Biardi*
You do a comprehensive search of the Medical/Engineering room. You find all sorts of high tech medical gear... or at least it was high tech a couple thousand years ago. You find enough equipment to make a fully stocked medical kit. The wall is lined with cracked and damaged cryogenic tubes; all of them are inoperable, save one. The tube looks like it might have been in working order for some time; judging the dust, it’s been the ONLY working tube for the last hundred years or so. You take notice the condition of the unit. It’s primitive by today’s standards of cryogenics, but you can definitely where the technology came from. It’s like being some kind of museum or holo-records simulation. A closer inspection that someone occupied the tube; it has the ‘lived’ look about it. Blowing some of the dust, you can make out a finger scrawling on the tube. In crude letters, you see the words **Darkstar** spelled out. The lights flicker and then go out. The emergency illumination system kicks in, and you all the tubes are lit up. You have an epiphany, that any other time, this would have been a place to save yourself by way of cryogenic perseveration. Now, it looks like a mausoleum, with all the tombs light up to be displayed. Your final resting place, your fate. Without warning, the ship shudders violently, like a Bantha going through death throes. It bucks and turns, and you think the that ice may be giving way beneath it, letting it slip deeper and deeper into the planet. The room is quiet now, the lights have come back on, though now, you will never get the eerie glow of the all the cryo-tubes out of your head. You come to the conclusion, if you do not move quickly, your kismet will be to buried with this ship when makes its final descent into planet’s core. You worked harder, re-purposed and determined to leave this planet…and never… look… back.
*Communication Center - Deel*
You have not received any communication from your friends in the mine. The Imperial shuttle has started hailing you again. The ground beneath you shakes violently causing your to almost lose your footing. You believe that the shuttle will be landing very soon whether they received an answer or not.

Kro-sa keeps working, even in the pitch black, repairing the speeder bike. His claws make good use of his new found utility belt's toolkit, and the mass of parts on the floor. He looks up from his work, eying the bike, wondering if it will need as much work...

Pushing together the scattered medical equipment he could find into a makeshift hip bag - he´d have to get a proper backpack later - Jordan point to Biardi and indicates the exit, signaling that they should probably try to get out of there. He casts one final glance towards the lines of cryogenic tubes, and in his mind ponders the word scribbled down from the inside of one of them. "Darkstar". It was nothing he had heard before, but he figured it should at least be taken back to Alliance Command.
As he began to make his way out of the engineering section, he opened his comm to the others.
**"Hey, did you fall asleep or what? I asked if you had found anything that can help us get out of here. Because I think it would be a good idea to leave, and to do it fast"**

Arty looks up at the sound and quickly sits as the lights go out. She gulps and waits for the lights to return, picking up her com "We've found speeders, dunno how useful they'll be down here but they may make things easier above." She moves to the speeders and the tools and scrap around to see if she could get them working again quickly.

Working quickly and efficiently the five of you manage to cobble enough parts to jury rig the speeders. The hardest part was trying to recharge the power cells but after some improvised and dangerous wire work that ends up draining most of what little power remains you have a trio of ancient working speeders. This ancient ship is sinking deeper into the melted ice cap and Imperials are landing above you. Jake has already perished in this frozen pit and now Deel isn't answering his commlink this mission is just getting worse and worse.

Deel heard the Imp. shuttle hailing the station again. He had to figure out away to keep them back so his friends had more time. Maybe he could fool their scanners some how. If they thought there was a radiation leak they might hold off until they knew it was clear. He picks up his comm link. "Guys still have Imp. shuttle inbound. Going to try and make them stay away, but you might want to hurry." Deel moves over to the senor controls and other read out there had to be something here that would help him.

**"Dee bikessss, bive peoplesssss. Will have to ride double, sssome, yessss?"** Kro-sa says as he mounts his bike, waiting, his massive form seeming to engulf the vehicle. He turns to look over his shoulder at the rest of the group wondering at how far they had come; wondering if they would make it out alive; wondering what he would do if they did.
*Can't go back home. End up in chains again. Never again,* he thinks.

**"Unless someone has a better plan, I say we move with that. Saddle up and move out"**
Kicking his speeder into action, Jordan gave it a few moments to really get going. He wished he´d had a few more minutes, then he could have crammed out some more juice from these speeders. Right now though, any extra speed he could gain by trimming the speeders would likely be eaten up by the time it took to make the modifications. Also, he wasn´t even sure these relics would be able to take the extra power, and they were already just cobbled together from spare parts mostly.
Hitting the accelerator, he sent his speeder going point as he tried to navigate his way out of the blasted hell hole they had found themselves in.

Arty eeps faintly as she was lifted so easily, wrapping her arms around the lizards waist to keep hold. she couldn't do much, for the best as she wasn't great with flying things herself, but at least she could lean the right direction. A brief glance was all she could give to the others to ensure they were on their way too before they were off and speeding to safety.

**Landing Pad**
The shuttle doesn't respond to your warnings of danger. It continues it's landing procedures, landing in the same place that until recently held your own way off this rock. A small contingent (12) come filing out. They fan out around the ramp securing the area. A lone man walks down the ramp dressed in a suit of black protective gear complete with helmet. He looks towards the mine and moves his head in a way that reminds you of a nerf scenting the air for predators.
**Ship**
The speeders hold up well despite their age carrying you quickly through ruble strewn hallways. You have reached the decision point, do you gamble and try and get out through the hanger or try and go all the way back to the airlock you first entered in from. Arty recalls seeing a lit up mine shaft across the water it should take you back to the surface.

The speeders quickly carry you across the underground lake to where the mine shaft ends. The industrial sized cargo lift easily accommodates you and your speeders. It carries you quickly up the shaft and towards the lights above. You hear the sounds of metal being twisted past its breaking point from below and the electric flashes as the ship is being torn apart by a giant grinder of ice.
Arty is watching down the shaft as the turbo lift carries them up. Flashes of lights from below light up the shaft in rapid succession with a strobe light effect. She isn't quiet sure but she gets the impression somethings were climbing the scaffolding below them.
On the surface you see a lambda Class shuttle docked where the ship you arrived on used to be. The Imperial troops are already fanning out to protect the shuttle.

## Re: Wookie-pops 2.0

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-31 03:56:09)

Somewhat relieved to be breathing the chill surface air again, Jordan looks over to where their ship had landed, only to see an Imperial Lambda-class shuttle landed. What was more, he spotted several white-armored stormtroopers spreading out in defensive positions to cover the ship. While this raised questions in his mind such as "Where was the ship?", "Where was Deel?" and most importantly "What the hell was going on here?", he pushed them all aside to deal with more immediate matters.
He remained seated on his speeder while he readied his rifle and checked it for ammo. He was sure that the others had seen them as well, but he still raised a hand to signal a halt. To do this as painless and quick as possible, they´d need to perform a combined attack against the imperials, and luckily the speeders would help a lot with that. While he waited for the others to get ready, he surveyed the scene, taking a headcount of the enemies, noting their defensive positions, noting possible cover for an advance and so on.

On exiting the lift the Stormtroopers catch Kro-sa's eye and nothing else. His voice twists out in a hissing, snarling guttural growl, his accent thickening almost to the point of incomprehensibility. He says only one word, filled with bitter hatred: **"Imperialssssss."**
The numbers and the way the Stormtroopers' armor blends with the snow are the only thing keeping him from rushing forward to sink teeth and claw in the soft flesh beneath their armor. Action without forethought is what brought him here in chains. His mouth opens slightly as he reflexively tastes the air, his anger causing his lips to draw back from his teeth as he si-ises his anxiety.

Arty watched the lights as they sped upwards in the shaft. She swore she could see something following after them...what was it? had she just been down there too long? was it the lost wookiees? Before she could voice anything the feel of fresh air hits her hard, making her gasp and turn right around quickly to view the scene before them.
"Imperialssssss."
He hissed out, Arty looking around the lizards shoulder to see them, eyes narrowed; when did they get here? where was the ship and Deel? oh no...Deel...had they found him?? "What do we do now?" she calls out to the others, trying to keep quiet. They needed to find the ship, Deel and get the hell of this planet.

**"What we do? We load up, take aim, and shows no mercy"**
It was a simple statement that came from the Mandalorian veteran. But really, there wasn´t more to it, at least not in his world. They were soldiers, and so were the Imperials. And whoever was the best soldier won. Luckily, he had no doubts about which side that was. He observed the stormtroopers quietly, taking note of their positions and armament, as he slowly moved his finger to the front trigger of his weapon.

It´s hard to make any good plan before we know the layout of the scene. But I was thinking some long range artillery followed by a rapid advance. Unfortunately I can´t fire the rifle from the bike, it´s too damn big, so might have to jump off.

Without taking the eye off the enemies in front of him, Jordan reached into his side holster and pulled out his sidearm. He reached out his hand towards Arty offering her the weapon.
**"Didn´t you know? Mandalorians always have another weapon ready. Don´t pull the trigger too fast though, or you´ll need to reset it"**
He took his eyes off the enemy for a while, looking at the rest of the squad.
**"Look, we either take them out now, or we run through a rain of fire as we pass them, and leave them at our backs. I don´t want to postpone finding Deel anymore than you do, but I´d rather not find him with a bunch of stormtroopers up my ion engine. I say we hit them hard, and once they´re out of the way, we can find Deel. Also, since we are currently unaware of where the hell our ship is, securing that shuttle could provide is with some insurance in how to get out of here"**

**"Oh I´ve got enough grenades for the lot of them"**
Waiting for a few moments to let the rest of his squad get settled for the attack, Jordan took a deep breath. He wasn´t sure if this would be the last push before they could get off this place, but he sure hoped so. Not that he didn´t like some good field action, but suffice to say he´d had enough of this place.
As the rest of the squad seemed ready for action, he grabbed hold of his rifle with one hand, and hit the accelerator on the speeder bike. He sent the vehicle forward at a high velocity, but pulled it into a sharp halt after only a dozen meters or so. Quickly raising his rifle, he took estimate of the distance to the enemy, lowered the barrel a bit and pulled the front trigger, sending a small spherical package soaring through the air towards the stormtroopers closest to the main complex.

Arty blinks as her pilot escapes for another speeder, blinking she looks over to Antur and shrugs before grinning broadly, winking to him and cocking her head to the bike she waits for him to join her, kissing his cheek "for luck." she states.
Getting comfortable behind him and checking over the blaster quickly she represses the urge to cheer into battle as they race off. With the grenade sailing before them as the only warning for the troopers she raises her blaster, leaning a bit to the side to better get a shot. She takes aim, waiting for just the right moment. She didn't want to waste a shot, and certainly didn't want to miss. "Don't get startled when I fire." she playfully warns the man in front of her.

He knows that next in the chamber lies a Stun grenade, but he figures it will work just as well to take the troopers out of the fight. He would have to talk with their requisition officer about getting some real ordnance when he got back though.

Jordan's stun grenade goes off with little effect. The troopers quickly scramble up and spread out while rushing towards his speeder. Their white armor makes it hard to see them against the frozen background.
Kro-sa drops the carbine as he clasps his hands together for his overhead slam that causes the trooper neck to pop and his helmet to crack.
Antur guns the speeder forward as Arty fires. The speeder's evasive manuevers make it impossible for her to connect with the prone troopers. As the speeders get closer the troopers quickly scramble to their feet and open fire. The two closest to Biardi's speeder start rocking and rolling as blaster fire starts spraying.

*Damn those useless, nonlethal charges…*
Seeing his chance for an easy victory blown away by the ineffectiveness of the tun charge, Jordan let another round slide forward into the chamber, this time a lethal one. He kept his eyes on the troopers, and even though their armor worked quite well as camouflage in the snow, the movement and their weapons gave them away quite easily. While two of the soldiers he had been firing at broke off towards the nearby buildings, he caught sight of two of them moving into a position to flank the rest of his squadmates.
Lowering the barrel of his weapon to compensate for the decreasing distance, the explosive payload flew in a flatter arc as he pulled the trigger. Knowing that all he had left in the chamber was another Stun round, he let his hand slide back towards the primary trigger of the weapon as he prepared to take on the remaining troopers the traditional way.

Kro-sa looses his coughing hissing roar as the Stormtrooper falls. He leaps from the bike, and charges the nearest Imperial, meaning to do much more murder before the day is done.
Biardi leans hard to the right, kicks the repulsors on full and whiplashes his bike into a hard 90^ turn, drawing his pistol and firing point blank at the Stormtrooper he means to pass by.

Arty was proving that shooting from a moving anything was difficult. Granted it was fun...but still too hard to do. watching the lizard jump off to do damage instead of attempt to hit anything on the speeder Arty looks over to the landed ship and then the troopers. Grinning faintly "Gun it, I want that ship." she says into antur's ear, hanging on as he guns the engine again to get them going.
She couldn't hit them from that distance with the speeder moving, so...narrow the target. Taking aim, using her free arm to support herself against Antur she aims for the damnable troopers.

Jordan's grenade blows a large crater in the packed snow but other wise has little effect. The Stormtroopers scatter, two flanking the close attackers while the other two move to engage Jordan. Their shots deflect off the speeder Jordan is using for cover.
Kro-sa rips a gaping wound in the Stormtrooper's breast plate as he collapses in a heap. Biardi swings around whipping his blaster towards another trooper. His shot hits center mass leaving another trooper dead in the snow. The remaining troopers break and scatter shooting wildly. Blaster fire rains down around Kro-sa and Biardi. A few come close to Kro-sa's scaly hide but nothing solid.
Antur and Arty burst by the breaking troopers and whips the bike around looking up the boarding ramp. Antur revs the accelerator
"You ready?"

Kro-sa looses another coughing hissing roar and moves, only visible and flashes of red tipped green on the gleaming white snow. He soon buries his claws in another trooper, the weight of his massive body aiding the impact.
Biardi whoops and guns his engine, making his bike buck and jerk like a living beast before streaking forward. He leans out of the saddle, snapping off a shot at the closest Stormtrooper.

*Stand still you damn things…*
Seeing another grenade throw cascades of snow harmlessly into the air, Jordan wishes he had his pistol in hand. The rifle wasn´t optimal for small skirmishes like this, and was better used taking down larger and heavier targets. Assuming Deel was still alive, he´d have to remember to ask the Twi'lek to try and install some sort of power regulator allowing him to use it for precision fire.
Shifting the grips of his weapon he straightened a bit and lined up one of the stormtroopers in his sights and pulled the weapons primary trigger.

Jordan fires but the distance and the recoil prevent his shots from being effective. His hot laser digs steaming groves into the hard packed snow.
Kro-sa charges across the snow ground and leaps onto another trooper. The force breaks the troopers neck killing him instantly. Biardi laughs and wheels his swoop around and rockets back towards Jordan. His shot drops another trooper leaving only four remaining.
Antur and Zerah rocket up the ramp into the interior of the transport. Antur cuts the thrust at the last minute and with a quick application of the brakes you narrowly miss slamming into the back wall of the shuttle. There are two very surprised looking Imperial pilots looking out the hatch from the cockpit.
*You are basically at the wall near 15 on the interior map*
The remaining troopers decide discretion is the better part of valor at this point and begin to start heading back towards the ship. They take a few shots at Kro-sa and Biardi. One of the shot actually connects with the large lizard causing a massive burn across his back.

Arty grins and waves to the two surprised pilots "Hello there! we're taking the ship! mind leaving like good little imperials before I have to shoot you?" she calls to the cockpit cheerfully, blaster in hand. she glances to Antur who checks his own weapon.
She gives him a nod to order him to the speeder for cover "watch the front!" she calls to him while she waits a few seconds by the wall, letting the pilots ahead simply turn away so she could begin her sneaking.

Antur, cover, hold for shot of imperials at the entrance.

The blaster bolt across his back brings another scream from Kro-sa, this one different only in pitch as he wheels around to face the advancing troopers. Seeing only four left sends him scurrying towards the closest, aiming to finish this skirmish no matter what...
Biardi chuckles to himself as another trooper falls and continues his loop, crossing between Jordan and the troops before pulling around to place the troops in the triangle with himself, Jordan, and Kro-sa as its points. He squeezes off another shot...
