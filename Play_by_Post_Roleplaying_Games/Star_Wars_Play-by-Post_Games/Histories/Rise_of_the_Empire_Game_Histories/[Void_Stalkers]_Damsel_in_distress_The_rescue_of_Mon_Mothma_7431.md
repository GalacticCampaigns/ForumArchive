# [Void Stalkers] Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-03 15:15:10)

Corellia Sector
In flicker of psuedo-motion a white spec appears against the black background of space. Long range scans indicate it is a corellian corvette. Its transponder pings off that its registered to The Alderaanian diplomatic corps, Tantive IV. Your comm system lights up as you recieve an incoming message.
"This is Captain Antilles, Tantive IV has a docking bay prepared for you. You are cleared to begin your approach."
Soon you sit in a confrence room with high backed chairs and a large table with a holo-emitter in the center of it. A golden protocol droid asks if you would like any refreshments while you wait for Senator Organa.

The short, thin blonde human unabashedly takes a chair near the head of the table. Smiling brightly, he informs the protocol droid he would take a glass of Corellian wine. He looked very comfortable at such a gathering, waiting for a galaxy wide known Senator to enter the room. "Nice digs," he thought to himself, "dad would approve."
He waited patiently for the Senator to find out more about why he had been called and more about the Stalkers.

The young Twi'lek Deel walks into the conferance room. Looking around in amazement at the grander of it. "Man I would love to see the specs on this thing." "The engines alone would be fasanateing." Deel takes a seat and pulls out his datapad from his coat pocket. and starts to go over something on it. Looking at the protocal driod. "Friut juice will be fine thank you."

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Yogi** (2008-03-06 13:03:41)

As Jake strode into the briefing room he heard the Twi'lek order a drink from the droid. Looking about the well laid out the room he noticed that it afforded everyone who was in here had a good view of the holo-emitter. As he took his seat next to Deel he spoke to the two that were already seated.
"How you two doing? Heard any scuttlebutt on what's happening?"
He leaned back into the comfortable high backed chair and looked to the protocol droid.
"I'll take a Corellian ale please."

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **ganthet** (2008-03-06 13:17:36)

Looking up from his datapad Deel looks at the man setting next to him. "Fine Thank you. I haven't real heard anything as to what is going on." "I don't get out of the engine room much." Looking over at the other person setting in the room. "You heard anything?"

Zim stands up after seeing the two newest arrivals, and offers his hand to each, smiling broadly. "Nice to meet you. Friends call me 'Zim.' I guess you are here to meet with the Senator as well."
To the Twilek, Zim says "Fruit jiuce? We aren't on the clock yet, buddy. We are allowed to loosen up a bit."

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **ganthet** (2008-03-06 13:37:45)

"Never been much of a drinker." Deel takes the mans hand. "Name is Deel Olan, Some of my friends call me Freefall but that is along story." "Meeting a senator huh, Which one?"

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-06 13:57:15)

"Rumor has it that Bail Organa will be meeting us."
Zim had never met the Senator, but he knew his father had met Organa on more than one occasion. Zim wasn't sure whether or not to mention that to the Senator, depending on the mood of the meeting.

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-06 14:23:49)

Antur walks in looks over the group and sits down "After burner please" he states to the droid. Antur quickly looks over the group thinking to himself we will see what they can do behind the stick. Antur wears his red flight suit and even in off time has a blaster at his side. Looking a little malnourished Antur has recently lost some weight and it shows in his face. His hair somehow wildly in style. Bored outside a cockpit Antur begins to flick a credit chip in the air, his eyes darting throughout the room.

"Bail Organa, really. I met him once. I was just a kid at the time. My dad used to do some…side work for the Jedi and others from time to time till…" Jake stopped talking and looked down. He didn't need to go into details as everyone knew the Jedi and any who supported them, including his father, were hard to find nowadays because they were all dead.
"Anyways, he seemed a giant to me then. Its been about fifteen years I think.  A bit of melancholy entered his voice as he remember the time with his dad. "One thing is for sure."  He added with a bit more enthusiasm. "If it is him, it's bound to be interesting."
Jake looked at the new comer who entered and sat as they were talking. He nodded his head in greeting. "Hi, names Jake Golan." He stood to shake the mans hand and the others as well.

"Good afternoon," Zim tells the newcomer, "Pleasure to meet you. Name's Zim" the blonde haired human tells the newest arrival. "Spiffy flight suit."

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-06 15:44:34)

The golden droid takes your drink orders and shuffles out of the room. A few moments later the door slides open and in walks Imperial senator Organa. He takes a seat at the table.
" Gentlemen we have a crisis that needs to be avoided. My sources have informed me that Senator Mothma is going to publicly denounce the Emperor on the senate floor. The Emperor will respond to this with charges of treason."
The droid returns with your drinks. The senator pauses while you are served.

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-06 15:59:00)

Once the droid is gone he continues
"I need you to go to Corascaunt and extract Mon Mothma before the Emperor can respond. I have forged documents that will get you planet side. She will most likely be at her apartment in the Senatorial District. Your squadron commander is on another assignment so Lt. Zim will be in charge till he returns."

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-06 16:09:27)

Zim had a few questions about the mission that immediately sprang to mind. "Excuse me Senator. I assume we will be removing the Seantor post her announcement against the Emperor. How will she make it safely from the Seante floor to her apartment? Is she expecting us? Better yet," Zim laughed, "Will the Emperor be expecting us?"

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-06 16:23:17)

Antur salutes the Senator, then looks to Zim "For now we are a bunch of nobodies I doubt we will be expected, probably why we where selected for this mission. After a mission like this though we might earn a name for ourselves." Looking back to the Senator "More importantly what is our extraction point? What if any back up could we expect? What will we have at our disposal and yes if captured I never meet you saw you I am just some guy looking for kicks right?"
Antur blows out his after burner drink and takes a drink.

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-06 16:39:47)

The Senator listens to your questions.
"The senate meets in ten days. The Emperor rarely attends them anymore. Mon Mothma should be able to make it out before he hears of it. I am sure he will respond quickly and lock down her diplomatic vessel. There isnt enough time to assemble backup so you are on your own. You should have a window of oppertunity before the ISB locks down the spaceport in the Imperial Center. Is there anything you need? Voidstalker 1 is fueled and prepped in the docking bay."

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Yogi** (2008-03-06 16:52:38)

Jake raised his eyebrows when he heard the Senator Organa lay out was going to happen on Courscant. *Finally someone is going to stand up and say what needs to be said.* Jake thought to himself
Senator Organa was about to continue when the droid entered with the drinks. Waiting to continue till the droid left the man stood there.
When he finished Zim and another had a few questions. Jake waited for answers before he piped up.
"Ten days isn't a lot of time. Will be be able to get word to her with details of our arrival and where to meet? If she went straight to us and not back to her quarters it would get her and us off planet quicker."

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **ganthet** (2008-03-06 17:20:13)

Deel seems to come life when he hears what is going on. "Man that is a tall order for the frist time out." "But seems doable." "The only problem I can see is the fact that i might have some problems moving around." "I was under the empression that they weren"t to crazy about Alien speices running around unchecked." Deel looks at the rest of people there. "I hope you have found away around this?"

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-06 17:55:45)

"We don't have anyway of contacting her. Holo-net communications are heavily monitored by the ISB (Imperial Security Bureau). Lt. Deel if you keep a low profile you shouldn't have to much trouble. The Imps are cracking down on non-humans but technically you still have your right to be on corascaunt. They won't hesitate to arrest you for no good reason though."
*The red and blue are kinda hard to see. Im old and blind ok lol. The green is good though*

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-06 20:02:17)

"Can you think of anything else we need to know before heading out, Senator?" Zim asks, half standing up from his spot at the table, ready to go.
OOC, I am having a hard time finding a blue that is easily visible. I'll be experimenting over the next few posts, unless someone knows a good one. Maybe orange is better?

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **ganthet** (2008-03-07 01:06:14)

"Don't stand out got it." "I will try my best sir." Deel goes back to his datapad looking Enginring manual. "Sir is there anyway I can get specs on the ship we will be taking I would like to frimilarize myself with the ships systems as soon as I can."

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-07 01:30:03)

Bail looks over the group.
"I'm not sure what you might need equipment wise but the quartermaster could probably make few recomendations. As for the nightstalker specs I'm sure my crew chief can supply you with that information. Supply is near the docking bay."
He leans back in his chair and looks you over with an appraising eye.
"If there is nothing else then may the force be with you."
*ooc:DarthAnthrax can't post reliably but his character is with you*

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-07 06:05:36)

Antur catches the credit chip in his hands then flips it through his fingers. "Give me something to pilot and I am good to go. But I will visit your quartermaster see what this crew chief has for supplies." Lt Cage meets the senators gaze then gives a salute, he does not reply to the force remark.
"If that will be all sir I think the boys here and I would like to get started?"

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Yogi** (2008-03-07 08:10:35)

Jake stands up and salutes the Senator. "We'll make sure to check in with the Quartermaster. Maybe he can pony up a snub fighter or two. Like Antur said give me something to fly." He said with a smile.
"Lets go to work."

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-07 08:21:14)

"Sounds like we are ready then," says Zim as he stands up from the table. "Let's go find the Quartermaster."

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-07 11:19:09)

Senator Organa stands and leaves. Threepio moves in and starts cleaning up. You make your way down to the docking bay area. You ask around and get directions to Supply. You walk up to the counter and soon a grizzled old man comes out from behind a stack of crates. He has an annoyed look on his face.
"What?"

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-07 11:21:52)

Zim responds to the grumpiness of the person at the supply office by offerring an even bigger than normal smile. "Hello, good sir,' he states, "We are looking for the Quartermaster. Might you be the object of our search?"

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-07 11:46:50)

He looks your group over and sees that you are all officers. He gives a half hearted salute.
"Yes sir, Im staff sgt Magly. What do you need?"

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-07 11:59:51)

Antur looks over this staff sgt Magly. "Where where told we had full access to the supplies, though I have my doubts if there is anything of use. Why don`t you show us what you have we can choose for ourselves." Antur looks around trying to find anything of use security kits, med packs, stun grenades, R2 droids etc .....

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-07 12:15:01)

Poor Staffsgt Magly looks shocked at the idea of letting you behind his counter.
"With all due respect Sir this isnt a general store. You need anything I will get it and then you sign for it."

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-07 12:32:16)

Antur smirks at the crew chief "How about an astro droid, six stun grenades, some secure comm links for all of us and what do you have in the way of heavy weapons an E-web maybe?"

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-03-07 12:51:45)

Having remained silent during the briefing, Jordan decides that some additional equimpent can always be useful.
"What do you have in terms of explosives? Grenades and other stuff"
*OOC: Wow, talk about different time zones. CanÂ´t a guy get some sleep and go to work without his game running away from him? :P Not to worry though, IÂ´m still here, and thing will get easier in a few days, when I get my own computer back)*

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Yogi** (2008-03-07 12:52:20)

Jake smiles at Antur's request. An E-web was a tall order. but maybe a few blaster carbines or rifles would be in order.
"Sgt. maybe a few blaster carbines or rifles if you have any. What about body armor? Any of that lying around?"

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-07 13:05:32)

Zim: Sergeant Magly, could you please check if there are any stun or frag grenades behind your counter?

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-07 13:07:59)

"E-web your funny Sir. Lets see what I got. Alderaan has a pacifist society but we keep some weapons to repel borders"
He walks back amid the racks and crates. He starts filling a repulsor cart with kit. He comes back with 5 DL-8 Blaster carbines, 10 stun grenades, 5 blast vests, medkit, 5 field kits, and a security kit.
"Hows that?"

### **ganthet** (2008-03-07 13:12:52)

Deel head jumps up from his datapad at the sound of new gear. "What you got in the way of Computer gear?" Deel seems almost excited that he might find something new to play with. "I also need to the find the Crew Chief about the specs on the Nightstalker." "I would like to go see what it is capable of."

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-03-07 13:15:05)

"Those stun things are nice, but what about the heavy explosives?"
Jordan grabs a carbine and vest, checking both for functionality.

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-07 13:26:28)

"Here you will need these too."
He grabs long range comlinks with scramblers.
"Computers hmm.."
He rummages around some more. Comes back with a port comp in shock proof case.

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-07 13:33:48)

Antur garbs a blaster carbine, two extra clips, a med pac, a comm and two stun grenades "This will do ... no droid?" Antur says jokingly before packing up his new gear. "Well I could use some time with the stalker check her over make sure she is space worthy, which hanger bay could I find her?"

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-07 13:36:48)

Thank you very much, Sergeant, Zim says, bending down to pick up his equpiment pack including the carbine, blast vest, and 2 grenades, a field kit, and one of the long range comlinks with the attached scrambler. He makes a mental note to stow all of this equipment in his locker so that he can select what he needs before heading off the ship.
I am not very good at healing wounds. If one of you are, could you take the medkit? I have a sinking feeling it might be very necessary before long.

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-03-07 13:40:03)

"I have some skill at healing wounds, but IÂ´d prefer it if someone else would take that duty"

"I prefer to be *making* them rather than closing them"

Deel grabs the Computer and Longrange commlink with scambler. Reading though the datapad everything seem to check out and signs. "Not much for the xtra fire power but i suppose I can learn." He grabs one of the carbines. Slinging the carbine over his sholder and putting away the comlink and his data pad making sure to hand the other one back. "Well I heading to the flight deck to see the ship and find the Crew Chief. I can't wait." "Oh who is going to grab the Field kits?"

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-07 14:21:02)

You enter the docking bay. The large bay is full of personnel working. There is a large transport in the center being fueled for launch. On the far side of the bay a pair of Y-wings are in pieces with techs crawling all over them. The transport is a Koensayr ILH-KK Citadel-class cruiser.
*stats are in vehicle section. There supposed to be 2 grenades, 1 carbine/vest/field kit for each of you*

"That should do it. Shut down the fuel lines and uncouple them."
The watery voice calls out from the open docking ramp. A couple of techs run over to the fuel lines attached to the transport.
"Right away Master chief."
One of them yells.

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Yogi** (2008-03-07 17:06:15)

Jake grabbed the his share of the equipment that the Sgt. laid out for them. Having the little bit of extra firepower made him feel a little bit better. Still the hand full of them on a potentially hostile planet was not good odds. Still it was a chance to strike back in some way at the empire.
They made their way to the docking bay. Seeing the Citadel-class cruiser there waiting for them made him smile. It was a nice ship. Decently armed and armored. It was perfect for what they were going to do.
"Well things are looking up. This ship is better than what I expected."

Visibly annoyed with the lack of heavy weaponry, Jordan grabs a few stun grenades and then follows suit with the others and heads for the hangar. The ship seems to be in working condition, and he is looking forward to taking her for a test run. Not too sure about the "diplomatic" designation though...

### **Frost** (2008-03-08 19:43:24)

A Mon Calimari walks down the loading ramp.
"X0 don't harasses your new squadron. Sorry thats Capt. Jax's astromech you squadron commander. He doesn't like to wipe his memory so he is a little spunky. Jax is out on another assignment right now but he should be here when you get back. She is prepped and ready to go."
X0 spins his dome in a circle and make a rude noise and heads back into the ship.
"Im Master chief Torel, I heard you need scematics? They are all in the ships computer you should be able to download them from there."
*ooc:Darth Anthrax Tantive IV is a diplomatic vessel so it cannot carry heavy weapons and explosives with out violating its status. Plus your going into the most heavily gaurded core world you thing they are gonna let you walk around with a heavy blaster rifle or a thermal detonator?*

"She seems suitable to me. LetÂ´s get this party rolling"
Jordan follows Deel up the ramp, starting a survey of the ship, and most carefully investigates the weapon emplacements.
(OOC: I know that. But Jordan can still be disappointed canÂ´t he? : )

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-09 13:34:12)

The transport is an older ship but well taken care of. Its weapons are primarily defensive having to Ion cannons in turrets. But it also has a concussion missle launcher to help baance her out. She is fueled and stocked. You have clearance for take off when your ready. The ship normally requires a crew of three but the copilot chair has been modified to allow X0 to help fly. You can still seat a normal copilot but X0 might not like it. The ion cannons and laser cannons are in turrets and will require a gunner to operate.

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-09 15:15:40)

Antur finds his way to the cockpit runs a diagnostic on all ships systems and takes a seat in the pilots chair. "I found my spot, I am getting ready to run a startup on the engines the diagnostic should not take long. With a ship like this we should blend into the city planets local traffic easily."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-03-10 07:51:48)

*"Roger that. IÂ´ll be taking a seat in the turret. Call me when something needs to be gunned"*
Jordan takes a seat in the laser turret, starting to familiarize himself with the controls there.

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-10 08:34:30)

Zim watched as people began gravitating to their natural positions on the ship...Antur to the pilot's chair and Jordan to the turret. Zim decided to grab a station close by to the cockpit, prepared to assist the pilot and the copilot droid if anything out of the ordinary occurred.

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-03-10 11:44:09)

You take the ship through its pre-flight check list and all boards are green. The turrets power up and are good to go. Scematics are available for download into computer. X0 is slotted and ready to astrogate. Everything seems good to go for launch.

Antur comms to the tower "All systems are a go ready for take off." After going through a series of controls on the consol Antur punches the ships engines and blasts out of the hanger bay quickly turning the ship in a spiral and buzzing the control deck at full speed before setting the Hyper drive course.

The ship hits lightspeed and vanishes in a flash. The trip takes ten days.
The planet Corascaunt looks like a city floating in space. The entire surface is covered in layers and layers of buildings. Some are so tall they almost break the atmosphere. The space around the planet is cluttered with ships, orbital stations and other space traffic. Your credentials withstand imperial scrutiny and after a few hours waiting you are allowed to land on the planet.

Feeling a little exposed, as always, without the comfort of his armor, Jordan walks down the ramp. He takes a look around, seeing skeletal stormtroopers walking around the spaceport. Once again, images of Kamino flashes before his eyes. Checking the functionality of his Slug Rifle, he waits for the other to follow.

Deel grabs the computer anyway and heads down the ramp to stand beside Jordan. Seeing the security and Stromtroopers moving around makes him feel uneasy about being here. "I don't like this. But I am with you guys, you can count on me." He tries not to let his uncomfront with his new surroundings to show but it is hard for him.

Stepping off the ramp Antur has all he needs (his listed items plus the comm link given to him) taking a deep breath Antur falls in with the others.

You easily find a data terminal that provides you with basic maps. You flag a aircab easily enough. The droid pilot says
"Welcome to Jonny cab please state your destination."

### **Frost** (2008-03-11 11:45:44)

"Right away sir. Thank you for choosing Jonny cab."
The cab takes off and blends into the mass of air traffic. The ride takes maybe ten minutes. The cab starts to slow.
"I am sorry sir. It seems that all traffic is being diverted away by order of the Imperial security bureau. Please choose alternate destination.

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Yogi** (2008-03-11 16:49:02)

Jake listened to the Jonny cab as it told them that traffic was being directed away from their destination. That wasn't good at it meant that CSF or worse was already trying to lock down the Senatorial Borough.
"What's the closest place you can set us down to the area?" Jake asks the droid pilot.

The cab drops down a man made canyon of buildings. He flys down three levels and enters a large tunnel made for traffic. The cab shoots down the tube and pulls up to a landing platform.
"That will be 32 credits thank you for choosing Jonny cab."
The landing platform has several transport tubes that lead all over the senatorial borough. You find one that heads to the surface but when you try to access it an automated voice tells you it is temperarily out of service. There is a door that says maintenence beside the tubes that is locked with an electronic security lock.

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-13 08:53:38)

Zim hands the droid 35 credits, and informs it to keep the change. After the cab zooms out of sight, he turns to the group, "All right guys, who has any ideas? We could try to get into the maintenance room and see if we can override the blocks on the tube. Anyone feeling lucky?"

---

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-13 09:14:55)

Antur replies to Zims question with a smile and speaks low "We should gather some intell, if any of us are any good with computers we might be able to find out some information like how many senators are here if there are large numbers of imperial troops stationed close by. We could also listen in on the crowds might pick up something use full that way too. We also need to know how to get in upstairs and how to get out an interior map would be helpful. Otherwise we should start making our way up a few floors. "
Antur rubs his hand against his short hair missing the length he once had (it will grow back). Scanning the crowd Antur begins to take note of those who are tourists like himself and those who are working bustling about their daily routine. Antur will try his hand at getting close enough to overhear some conversations while playing the tourist looking up at the buildings in awe.

Most of the beings here seem to be people who live or work nearby. Tourist would be up topside. You catch snippits of hushed conversation. They seem to believe that a senator is being arrest for treason. People notice how heavily armed your group is and give you scared looks and a wide berth.

Looking to Deel then the others "Do you think you could hack a speeder for remote control access? That would get us out in a snap and without leaving someone behind to babysit a speeder."
Antur thakes a casual look around and makes note if anyone is paying their group extra attention. "Maybe we should take a two pronged aprouch to this it might draw less attention and we could meet back up on the upper levels."

As they reaches the second end of the ladder, a small maintenance access chamber, Jordan can hear raised voices on other side of the door. He swings his rifle of his back and holds it hanging in one hand. In the other, he readies a stun grenade. Waiting for the entire team to gather, he moves close to the door, trying to hear what is being said and to try and identify the voices talking. He specifically searches for the sound of Mon Mothma, and also the typical radio-voices of stormtroopers.

Two stormtroopers stand gaurd over it. At the far end of the court yard is the lavish senatorial apartments. There are four stormtroopers outside the apartments. You see the doors to the building open and two men in black ISB uniforms lead out Mon Mothma in shackles. The crowd does not sound pleased but the stormtroopers prevent them from doing more than yell. Mon Mothma stands tall with her head held high.

Upon wiewing the scene outside the door, Jordan silently offers a few well spoken curses in MandoÂ´a.
*"Of course it wonÂ´t be easy, it never is is it? Whatever we decides to do, we need to do it fast"*
He sighs and awaits the others response, ready to crash through the door shooting if he needs to.

Antur smiles at the scene before him. "How nice of them to provide us with transportation." Antur scans the area again.
"Well guys I think we could get closer by using the crowd, hey some of them might even help." Antur looks a little worried at that last thought. "Though I am not keen on getting innocents killed. I say two of us lay down controlled aimed fired at the ISB agents the others lay down crazy burst fire at the men in white." Antur ready`s his heavy blaster pistol. "I am good to go!"

"I'm game on that. We should also make sure that the two at our new getaway speeder don't try to leave the party."  Jake said as he drew his blaster from its holster and hid it behind his back. Saving him from having to draw it out.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-03-17 08:59:36)

*"Okay, here we go"*
Jordan slips discreetly out the door, doing his best to blend in with the masses. Knowing he wonÂ´t have much luck trying to hide his rifle, he does his best to produce the apperance of being a guard or security personel belonging to CSF or some other appropriate agency. Something that shouldnÂ´t be too hard, since thatÂ´s something he has spent a lot of his life doing.

Jordan is scanning the crowd looking for any sign of trouble. He notices a young woman with red hair in the crowd, she is watching your group instead of the spectacle in the courtyard. She locks eyes with you then pulls her cloak up and melds into the crowd.
The speeder is 18 squares away. Mon Mothma is 20 squares. There is a lavish courtyard with shrubs, statues, and other cover.

Zim attempts to blend into the crowd and attempts to move to within 10 meters or so from the speeder, opposite of the group of 4 troopers, so that the speeder might provide some cover from that group when blasters start firing.

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-03-17 11:35:30)

As Jordan scans the crowd, he notices a read-haired woman looking straight at them. When she notices him, shes quickly vanishes into the crowd. Feeling uneasy about it, he whispers back towards the others.
"Heads up guys, someone was just watching us. I donÂ´t know who she works for, but she could be ISB. Keep your eyes open"
With that, Jordan moves through the crowd, in the same direction as the woman vanished to. He keeps his eyes open for her, but turns most of his attention towards Mon Mothma and the others.
(I hope thatÂ´s not who I think it is :P . Perception check to try and locate her)

Feeling sour over his miss, Jordan at least hopes the rapid burst of sharp metal things had some kind of scaring effect. Sprinting behind a shrub, he drops prone and fires again, taking a shot at the same ISB agent.

Seeing as the remaining ISB agent takes Mon Mothma and tries to use her as a shield, Jordan drops one hand of the rifle and quickly produces the stun grenade from wher he left it.
*"Better stunned than dead"*, he mutters for himself before he lobs the grenade. With the grenade away, he picks up the rifle again and readies for another shot. At anyone really.
(+5 attack with the grenade (4d6 stun damage)
Just for the record, how many ISB agents are actually present??? Because I got the impression that they were two to start with, and if Deel critted one, then how can 2 still be standing?)

Jakes shot missed. Actually it missed by a mile. With Antur pitching and weaving and the woman also dodging it was just to hard to hit her. Unfortunately the same results did not also apply to her as he saw her incoming fire impact with the speeder.
Being an experienced pilot he could tell that the speeder was in pretty bad shape. The amount of smoke that began to trail them was testimony to the womans effectiveness with the speeders blaster cannon.
"One more hit like that and this is going to be a really short trip."  He yelled. "She's good I can't hit her."
Jake lined up again and tried to shoot her.

You all hear a mass of honking and beeping coming from up a head. The object has gotten alot closer rather quickly. You can finally tell what it is, it is the Voidstalker flying sideways through the crowded maze of buildings. Speeders and transports are fleeing from it wildly in all directions. The tail section clips a communication tower and it falls into the deep crevaces between buildings. You see it is not alone it has a Corascaunt patrol vessel in hot pursuit. It fires on the stalker and its shields light up as the energy crackles around it. Over the comlink you hear X0.
"beep woot deet-op wheeee!"
Mon Mothma looks in alarm at the comlink then the approaching ship. She says
"What is a barn swallow manuever?"

Jordan and Zim's combined fire take out the last trooper and his speeder spins off into the distance. Jakes shot at Red forces her to dodge out of the way and into dense traffic fleeing from the Voidstalker. You see an explosion as her bike collides with another vehicle. The cargo bay doors open and Antur flies right into them. The transport slides across the cargo bay and slams into the far wall. The last thing you see before the cargo bay doors close is Red standing on the top of a cargo hauler watching as you fly up towards space. The ship rocks as another blast from the patrol ship hits it.

"Argh, my head," Zim mutters as he rubs the still-forming knot on his head from the rough landing. Combining his headache with the pain from the blaster bolt he took earlier in the firefight, made for a very uncomfortable near future. After stumbling to his feet, he immediately looked for the Senator. "Are you okay, Senator?" he asks, checking on Mon Mothma, who actually appeared to be in much better shape than himself.
"Good job getting us to the ship in one piece, Antur."

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-27 15:18:01)

Rubbing the new bump on his head Antur gets out of the speeder "I don`t think this is covered under the warranty." Seeing that the senator is ok Antur gives her a slight bow "Welcome to the Voidstalker, hopefully your voyage will be short if not uneventful please fasten your seat belts put your tray in its upright position and prepare for turbulence."
Antur runs out of the cargo bay and fast for the cockpit, tapping his com Antur shouts "I doubt we are out of this yet squad, that was too easy. Battle stations everyone grab a station and prepare for fighters. I will get the ship ready for hyperspace."

Jake saw Antur run for the cockpit and decided to head for the Laser cannon turret. At least from there he could help keep enemy fighters off them.

Antur hops into the pilots chair and takes the controls from X0. Status boards are lit up letting you know that shield are down 20% and the ship has taken minor hull damage. You see that the laser turret and one of the ion turrets just came online. Sensors show you are being chased by a Corascaunt patrol vessel. It is a small vessel capable of leaving orbit but has no hyperdrive. Zim takes the captains chair and Jake and Jordan check in from thier gunner stations. A second later Deel checks in from engineering. Mon Mothma sits back and watches to see how you handle this situation.

He heard Zim's excited answer as to where to go. It was a bad idea. One that could lead the Imps right them.
"That's a bad idea. They will follow us right to where we're going. XO do you have any other preprogrammed coordinates we could use to lead them away from our final destination?"

However good the point, Zim couldn't just let it slide without comment. "You sure we don't need to jump six or seven extra times, just to be safe?" he said with a laugh. "Just kidding, Jake.

Jake saw the laser bolts from his cannon harmlessly pass beyond the patrol craft. With Antur flying defensively it make it more difficult for the crafts gunners to hit them but also made it just as hard for him to score a good hit.
He heard Zim through the headset. He saw the targeting solutions on his display come through.
"Thanks Zim That should help."
Jake make an adjustment and brought the cannons to bear. He depressed the button that sent the deadly laser bolts at the patrol craft.

### **Frost** (2008-04-01 10:52:39)

The crew of the Voidstalker work well together. Even with Anturs spinning and weaving while having the throttle pushed to the max they still manage to hit the Patrol craft with two direct hits. The laser cannon shreds what little shields the craft had and the Ion cannon wreaks havoc with its electronics. Antur uses this to pull further away. The patrol craft bounces of a durasteel wall but maintains control. Its commander wisely decides to seek easier prey as you break atmosphere and enter the darkness of space. You clear the planets gravity shadow a few moments later and X0 activates the secondary coordinates he calculated. A few days later you make your second jump to the rendevous coordinates and dock with the Tantive IV. Once you have landed the ground crew proceeds to refuel and restock the ship. You are met by Bail Organa and his entourage. He and Mon Mothma exchange hugs and pleasantries for a moment, then she turns to you.
"Thank you for rescueing me from the clutches of the Emperor. You went into the lion's den and emerged victorious. Hopefully this trend will continue as we fight against his tyranny and try to restore the Republic. Now if you will excuse us I need to speak with Bail."
Senator Organa thanks you as well and he leads her out of the Hanger. His entourage remains with you how ever. X0 shoots down the ramp and wheels over to a darks hair older man.
"Deet whhooot veet wheeee."
"Is that right?" The man says to the droid. He looks at Antur then at the rest of you.
"X0 says you might have some real skills with the stick kid. I'm Captain Garrion Jax commanding officer of the Voidstalkers. Bail told me he sent the new squadron out while I was gone and you did well from the sound of it. These are the rest of the squadron Lt. Pyuuma and Rool.

"I'm sure we will have plenty of adventures together, but for now I must excuse myself to visit the nearest facility that serves drinks around here.

Artemis looks the group over, extending a gloved hand to those that offered and shaking it. "Name's Artemis, or Arty, whichever." She says with a grin, Arty looks to be 22 and human, her hair is short and wild; as though she just rolled out of bed and went about her day. The look is more so made when she runs a hand through her hair and just messes it up more, her hair color is strange, blonde with pink and light blue highlights; her eyes are blue and her skin is fair; she must spend most time in space or in covered areas. She wears brown pants tucked into tall brown boots, a holster on her hip holds a blaster, and a brown vest zipped only half way covers a white shirt underneath. She wears short brown gloves on her hands that look to be skin tight.
Arty looks up at the ship and groans turning to the Captain while pointing a finger at the ship "Am I going to have to fix that?"

Jake smiled as he saw his shot drop the patrol crafts shields and Jordan's ion blast crackle across its hull. He was about to shoot again when He felt the ship accelerate and pull away from the Imps. He was sure that they would be pursued once they reached space. But either they must have surprised the CSF and got off world before they could mobilize the planetary defense fleet. Which was just as well. The sheer number of imp ships both small and capital ship scale would surely overwhelm them. But none came and they were able to escape the planets gravity well.
Several days later they docked with the Tantive IV where they dropped off Mon Mothma. With a word of thanks she left them.
Greeted by Captain Jax their commanding officer Jake gave the man a salute and extended his hand. "Captain, nice to finally meet you." He also welcomed the two newcomers to the squadron. "Guys. The name's Jake Golan." 
Hearing Zim's offer which was also extended to Pyuuma and Rool he grinned. "We shouldn't keep him waiting as he's been talking about this since we blasted our was off Courscant."  He said with a smile as he followed Zim and Antur.

"Arty I don't think this is a priority. The damage looks minor justsome hull welding. If anything big was damaged X0 wouldn't be in such a good mood. Go ahead and have a little fun, we'll work on it later."
Jax walks over to Zim.
"I understand you did a pretty good job leading the squad. The important thing is you brought everyone home alive. Seeing as I out rank you first rounds on me."

Arty smiles brightly and does a small cheer behind the captins back , not just because she didn't have to work on the ship right away but that drinks were on him, not that she drank..much.
She grins and follows after the others catching up to fall in line with the man named Jake "Your Jake right? nice to meet you."

"Thanks Captain," Zim said as he greeted his superior. "It was more them than me. They are an amazing team. Antur can fly as well as any pilot I've seen. Deel kept the ship patched up and purring along. And Jordan and Jake, boy, I wouldn't want to be on the wrong end of one of their blasters." It truly had been a well executed mission. Everyone performed their roles admirably.
"If you insist, Captain, the first round can be on you. We'll have to figure out how to split up the next three or four rounds."

Jake noticed the girl with the wild hair fall in beside him. "Your Jake right? nice to meet you."
He looked to his left at her and smiled. "Yeah I'm Jake, nice to meet you also."  He remembered about how worried she was to be fixing the ship. "Don't worry too much about fixing the ship. Most of us know our way around fixing a ship I believe. I basically grew up on my dad's light freighter. He put a hydrospanner in my hands before I could walk."  He said with a grin as he kept pace with the others.

### **zerah** (2008-04-01 15:26:04)

Arty grins "oh I'm not worried about fixing it, I'm pretty good with tools." She nods her head, blonde, pink, and light blue hair flying over her eyes; she blows them out of her way again "I like giving the captin grief, it's fun." she turns her head to smile brightly at the human.

He smiled at Arty she blew the hair from her face. *She seems to be a pretty free spirit* He thought. He also noticed that she had a nice smile as it seemed to be there quite a bit. When she mentioned the Captain a question came to mind.
"Whats the Captain like? Does he run a tight crew or are thing a bit more informal?  Not that it mattered much to Jake. Either way it worked but he liked a good balance between the two.

Jax leads the squadron to the officer's club. He walks in and heads to the bar. The club is pretty well deserted as most people are on duty right now but thats the luxury of being a fighter squadron lots of down time. The club has the basic neccessities a droid bartender with over 3000 drinks programmed into it and a basic holo-juke box for entertainment.
Jax orders a round of Tatooine sun flares for the squadron.
"Live today for tomorrow we may die. Celebrate life and remember the fallen."
He shoots the shot and slams the empty glass down. The drink taste like hot sauce mixed with tequilla hot and spicy.

Deel walks down the ramp looking over his data pad. He seems not to notice anyone until he hears Senator Organa's vocies and then he snaps to. "Sorry sir was just going over a few thing about the engines." He turns to Senator Motha." Your welcome ma'am, I hope our pilot didn't make the ride to bumpy for you."
After the Senators leave the hanger Deel starts to survey the outside of the ship. "Not bad considering what could have happened." "Capt. what should we do with the speeder we baroed?" Not really waiting for an answer Deel greeets his new ship mates. "Hello my name is Deel Olan nice to meet you both. And don't worry I should have the ship ready to go for the next mission when ever that is." Deel head moves down to his data pad again. "Did I hear someone mention a drink I could use one after that ride home, all of Antur fanacy flying makes for an interesting ride." Deel says with a smile."Let's go."

*Tattooine Sun Flares? Good Lord…its gonna be a long day,* Zim thinks to himself. *The Captain like his drink strong.*
"Thanks for the round, sir. I will get the next. To change things up a bit, let's get a round of Hothan Ices." Mixing the warm and cool beverages will show the true drinkers in the crowd.
Zim turns to the new recuits: "Welcome to you both. What brings you to the team?"

Arty smiles at the Captins back then returns her gaze to the human beside her "He runs tight in command, if he gives an order you do it...I mean you can joke with him pretty easily just gotta learn his moods; like when he's had enough joking and it's time to get down to buisness and such." She chuckles softly "Outside of that he's pretty easy going, just don't push things right from the start." she winks and laughs.
Entering the bar Arty takes a seat and waits for the drink that the Captin was going to give around. She mutters the chant with the man but holds the drink up before giving the Captin a look before downing it in a gulp and slamming it to the table with a grimce.
Garcefully excepting the new drink she takes long sips of it before answering "Voidstalkers seemed like a good new team. Needed something for my skills, Captin knows I was starting to go a little stir crazy." She laughs

### **Yogi** (2008-04-01 16:19:51)

He listened to Arty as she explained about the Captain. "Thanks, that's good to know."  He said with a grin.
They entered the desolate bar. It most definitely was not what one would call first class but it worked. with the Captain ordering the first round of *Tattooine Sun Flares* Jake smiled. It seemed like that when the squadron was on down time they really could unwind if they so wanted.
Jake echoed the words that the Captain spoke tipped the glass back and follows suit of the others. It was good, hot but good. Already the tension was easing off him and he was relaxing. Taking the new drink that Zim ordered up he took a long sip from it.
Jake smiled when Arty mentioned about going stir crazy. "If the future of this squadron is anything like what the last week was you won't have to worry about that."  he raise the glass to his lips and took a drink.

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **Frost** (2008-04-01 16:45:25)

The Captain downs the Hothan Ice with the same gusto as the sun flare. He smiles to Arty at her stalking comment.
"I kept waking up thinking she was standing over me in my bunk. She is a trouble maker but she can usually fix anything she breaks. X0 seems to like her and thats good enough for me."
The Captain walks over to Deel.
"What speeder are you talking about?"

## Re: Damsel in distress: The rescue of Mon Mothma

### **zerah** (2008-04-01 16:48:06)

Arty laughs "most times I was" she snickers "stole his blaster from him once too, that was fun." she sighs as she remembers the fun she had making trouble, at the mention of X0 she smiles softly "yea I love that little droid, still learning what he says but I'm getting it slowly." She perks up though at the mention of a speeder and listens in.

Deel takes the drink offered by the Capt. and drinks it down. The taste of the spicy and the alchool in the drink seem to take his breath away. Deel trys to recover as best he can. "So Capt. when will we be heading out again?" He looks around at his commrads. "Just so I know how much time i have to get the ship ready."
As he walks past the bar he orders a furit juice before setting down at a table with his team. He looks at Arty. "So you are a mechcanic?"

"The one in the cargo hold that we used in our daring escape." Deel looks up at the Capt. "We kind of borrowed it you might say." Deel looks around at the others. "I was just wondering, cause we might be able to use it agin sometime if we need to." Deel can't help but let his love of all thing mechcanical so when he talks about ships and speeders and things.

"Acquisition liberation is one of my favorite things, the Empire has far to many toys for its own good."
Jax gets a weird look on his face and heads back to the bar says something to the droid. The droid brings over three shot glasses of a dark liquid and Jax downs them one after another till they are gone.
"Gentlemen and Lady Im gonna leave you to your own devices till 0900 tomorrow. Report to the flight deck at that time."
With that Jax walks out of the officers club the three shot glasses remain upside down on the bar looking like tombstones.

Arty watches the captin go, and then focuses on the glasses sighing softly. She looks down sadly a moment, her entire persona changed with that one moment. She looks up again and smiles though it doesn't hold the same as it did before and looks to the Twi'lek "how about we go look at that speeder?"

Antur comes back from programing a song into the holo-table, its also running a flight simulator game ready to go. "Oh that old speeder. Yea we liberated that from the imps, they won`t miss one speeder." Slapping Deel on the back "It was a fun ride too, a lesser pilot would have crashed head on into that taxi."
Antur looks back at the holo-table to make sure its still free, with the near empty cantina thats not really an issue. "Hey who is up for a game? I have the Battle of Coruscant up and ready to go its good practice." Antur blows out his afterburner drink and takes a generous drink. "Unless you all forfeit." Antur smiles and sits down at the table cycling through the available ships to run.

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-01 18:41:29)

Zim was interested to see how both members of the team would respond to a challenge, as he proceeded to the holo-table. Having known Antur for a bit now, Zim figured, there would no be letting anyone beat him at anything, even if the challenger was a pretty girl. Zim was also interested in seeing how Arty handled herself around their testosterone-laden crew. Hopefully, she would be up to the challenge.
"50 credits on Arty, if anyone isn't scared of a little wager," Zim exclaims happily. This was much better than running from Imperials. At least for a while.

### **zerah** (2008-04-01 19:44:49)

Arty grins at the wager "oh if only the captin hadn't left yet" she laughs and cycles through the list of ships for her favorite. She liked playing this game, helped her to keep sharp when she wasn't able to go out and fly.

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-01 21:00:15)

Antur smiles at the challenger looking back to the others Antur boasts "Ah a brave one, well at least there was one amongst the squad." Antur hits a series of keys and picks a V-19 torrent "Remember this is the battle of Coruscant we can only pick ships of the line back then. Though there are some top grade ships." After a few more key punches Antur states "Its on realistic mode, much harder and a lot of fun. Ships controlled by the computer can attack while we are engaged."
With that said the music Antur had chosen begins as does the game, capital ships on both sides enter the map and swarms of ships race for firing range.
((OOC: Antur has a few drinks on hand and some time as well to play the games and drink with his squad. Honestly if Frost wants the holo game to be played out thats fine or make a few rolls to see who wins its all good. Antur only wants to get closer to his squad))

Jake wanted a chance to so show what he could do at the stick of a fighter. He had spent a lot of time honing his kills. They knew he could shoot but they didn't know he was a good pilot.

The dark green skinned Rodian made his introduction quick at the hanger bay, and followed the group to the cantina quietly. Although he engages in the ceremonial chant for the fallen, he leaves his drinks on the table untouched. If you were to guess why, it was that Meeto wasn't much of a drinker. He orders a Cluster Jolt, a popular highly caffeinated non-alcoholic drink, by the time the others finish there drinks he his already on his third. He perks up at the "Battle of Coruscant" challenge, and hovers over the two players as they engage in simulated battle.

Follwing along, and speaking little as they rendewouz with the Tantive IV and are greeted by the captain, Jordan starts to belive that he might find it omfortable with the Voidstalkers. After all, they are no more than an extension of the fight he has been fighting his entire life.
As the squadron settles down in the cantina and enjoys their drinks, Jordan just sips carefully on his. The two new members of the team seems nice enough, but he wonÂ´t judge before he has had a chance to serve with them.

The Holo-game is fierce, Antur and Arty battle it out destroying Seperatist droid fighters in waves. They face Techno-Union elite fighters, Vulture droids, and dodge through wreckage of capital ships. Thier kill totals rack up fast but in the end Antur comes out ahead of Arty by only 2 kills. Cheers erupt from the group and money changes hands. You all feel the slight lurch as the Tantive IV jumps into hyperspace. The droid brings over another round of drinks.

Zim heard the Rodian speaking his language rather than Basic. To let Meeto know that at least one other member of the team spoke it, Zim replied in Rodese, "Jake and yourself might be a good match, Meeto. The winner of your match could play Antur." As he really hadn't spoken much with the Rodain, Zim continued in Rodese, "Nice to have you in the Stalkers, Meeto. What made you decide to join this squad?"

Well as much as I would like to stay here and watch Atry beat you at piloting Antur, I need to see to the repairs to the Viodstalker and our new speeder."

At the mention of the mechanic going to fix the new toys in the hanger Arty stands and ruffles her hair "Wait up I'll go with you!" She turns to the rest of the new team and mock salutes with a wink "See you boys later!" and runs to catch up.
Once walking beside Deel she asks curiously "so just the ship and a little tweaking on the speeder?"

When they reach tha hanger Deel enters the ship and gets his tools. "I guess we could start on the plateing, if you want?" Then we will need to run checks on the engines and the rest of the systems." "So where do you want to start?"

" I got a feeling that this team is going to be ruff on equipment. Well If you need anything let me know I will be in the engine room."

Diagnostic of the damage to the ship reveals minor hull damage. It will take about two hours estimated to fix.
The speeder on the other hand is barely held together. It has major structural damage and will take at least half a day of repair and alot of parts.

Zim leaves to his quarters, and figures he had just enough time to get in some breathing and meditation before getting his 8 hours of sleep.

After he has cleaned up he makes his way down to the cargo hold where Arty is working on the speeder. "How it going Arty. I see XO has come down to help you out." "Anything I can do to help out?"
Deel looks over her and the driods work. They seem to be getting along well so far. Arty was right though the speeder needed alot of work and a few parts wouldn't hurt either.

"This should be interesting lets run multi player, we can play the same side against the separatists. Still for points of course."

Jake smiles and takes a seat next to Antur. "Four huh that doesn't give the computer much of a chance now does it?" He said with a grin. He begins his own search for a fighter to use.
"This ought to be fun."

*"If computers could fight superior to humans, perhaps weÂ´d have seen a different ending of the Clone Wars. It will be a race for points"*
Jordan takes one of the remaining avaible seats.

Arty's hand darts out to a line of tools by the droid, touching the handles of a few before finding the right one "Captins pretty easy going, outside of battle of course. He runs tight commands and you know, if he gives you an order you do it. Once you get to know him he'll joke with you and you can joke with him too during orders; just gotta watch and learn his moods."

"Hmm. Sounds like a good man. I will have to try to make an effort to get to know him better." Deel doesn't understand why now the he has the need to get to know the the Captain, but if he is going to work for the guy that info is usefull.
Deel dives back into his work. After a few more hours he looks down at his crono and realize that they have to meet the captain at 0900 in the morning. "Hey Arty we need to rap this up, it is getting late and we have a mission briefing in the morning." Deel not really waiting for anwser starts to put away his tools. "I think our little friend here needs to get charged up so he can keep Antur from killing us with his flying. I am calling it a night."
(OCC: Deel will clean up while waiting for Arty to anwser, Then he will head to bed.)

Arty calls out from under the speeder "it's ok, head on to bed I'm gonna keep working for a while."

The four fighter jockeys settle in for thier battle. The competition is fierce and the difficulty has been upped by the computer to compensate for multiple players. You battle your way through the crowded space over Corauscant. Clone troopers die in droves around you as well as droid fighters. You provide cover for a pair of Jedi starfighters as they assault the flag ship of the Seperatist fleet. At the simulations conclusion Jake commands an impressive lead of 5 kills. The drinks keep coming and the club starts to fill up with other officers as the day shift gets off duty.

"Ok Arty, Don't say up to long." Deel finishes putting away his tools grabs his data pad and heads for his quarters. As he exits the cargo hold. "XO make sure she doesn't stay up to long, ok?" Hearing the driods anwser he leaves.

The sim was fun. Lots of fun with the four hooting and calling out enemy fighters. Not even worried about the score while the sim was running he was surprised to see that he won the round by 5 kills.
"Nice round guys. That was a lot of fun." He said as he finished his fourth drink and placed the glass on the table. "That's the lat one for me if I want to be in any condition for a briefing tomorrow. I wonder what they have in store for us?"
He noticed that the bar was now beginning to fill up with those who were getting off the day shift. After talking for a bit longer he excused himself and went to his bunk. In his bunk by 22:30 and sleeping five minutes later Jake got a good nights sleep. The big glass of water he drank would help with the cotton mouth he might get in the morning.

*"That was a good round. Although I guess weÂ´ll soon get a chance to try our skills for real again"*
Following JakeÂ´s example, Jordan finished his drink, and then he rose from the table.
*"IÂ´m going to resist the urge to keep playing sims until the morning. ItÂ´s been a long time since I was in a regular military unit, and IÂ´m beginning to remember why"*
He finds his way back to his quarters, and goes to bed, sleeping with his slug rifle within armÂ´s reach. And as always, he sleeps very light.

Arty chuckles "don't worry, X0 will make sure I get a decent amount of sleep or he'll tell the captin on me." She laughs and taps the droid again with her finger, seems it was the same as an affectionate pat to a friend. "He's had to force me to bed once or twice.." at the loud angry beeps she laughs "ok ok more than five! heh..I'm not to keen to be on his 'mothering' side again, it hurts." She laughs and pats the droid again.

The club fills up and drinks are shared. With Mon Mothma's rescue the squadron are treated like heroes. They are bought rounds and offered thanks. The night whiles away and soon everyone makes thier way to their bunks for the night.

Meeto always forgets to speak basic around humans it was sort of his quirk when he gets excited about something. He was glad Zim spoke his native tongue, and replies
'Oh right, I forget that I'm not on Rodia anymore. How did I join Void Stalkers? Well you can say I was recruited, I guess they think my computer skills are worth something.'
Meeto gets excited to play the next simulation, turning to Jake
'Teams are fine by me.'
Meeto seems to overly enjoy the simulation, and he is really intense when he plays almost in a trance. He will play all night if anyone wants to stay up with him. He orders another Cluster Jolt. Meeto is glued to the holovid screen while playing.
