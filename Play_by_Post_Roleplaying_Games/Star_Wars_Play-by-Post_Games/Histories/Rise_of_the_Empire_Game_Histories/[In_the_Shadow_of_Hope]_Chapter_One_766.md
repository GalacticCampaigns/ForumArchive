# [In the Shadow of Hope] Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-08 17:41:15)

You are sitting in what appears to be a briefing room, gathered around a table with an empty chair at one end. Five persons from different parts of the Galaxy, unified by only one thing: you all fight for freedom in the Galaxy, freedom from Palpatines Empire.
Your attemtion turns to the rooms entrance as a tall, bearded human male enters the room. He takes the place at the empty chair, and then stands up.
"Greetings to all of you, and thank you for attending to this meeting. I am captain Droga. I was formerly a memeber of the Coruscant Security Force, but with the conclusion of the Clone Wars, I resigned my post, and began to organize a resistance against the new order. Over the years, similar cells have appeared all over the Galaxy, and several voices in the Senate is secretly offering their support. But in order to challenge the Empire, we need to stand united. This was the main reason for calling you here, but a situation has arosen"
He sits down on his chair, looking you all over before continuing
"Yesterday, one of our agents picked up a distress signal, hailing from the remote world of Viraxia. After decrypting the code, they were able to identify the frequence as a frequence used by jedi during the war. We donÂ´t know if this means anything, but as far as we know, there could be a jedi on Viraxia. And if that is the case, we will make sure he is safely rescued. A jedi in our ranks would bolster the morale and resolve of uor forces, as well as show the Galaxy that the jedi still exist. This is were you come in. We will send you to Viraxia to investogate this and bring back whatever trace of the jedi you finds, preferrably the jedi himself. But you must be careful, we have no way at all of knowing wether the Empire has intercepted this signal as well. If that is the case, then speed is of the essence if we are to beat them to the jedi"
"Any questions??"

Harsgault shifts some in his seat as the officer indicates the possiblity of a Jedi still at large in the galaxy. It wasn't too long ago that he was keeping an eye out for Jedi to kill them, not to save them.
Ever the pilot, he speaks up when the mention of questions is given. "What craft are we to use for this mission? And why this collection, assuming we weren't chosen just because we are here." A touch of wry is written upon his lips at that last. It is not as though he has seen a vast variety of resources available here. The command structure may have had no other option.

### **ganthet** (2007-10-08 19:54:47)

Winter looks around and says, " It is a good bet the Empire knows about the signal." " Do we know if there is Impireals in the area ?" " And if there is how soon to we leave?"

Arrialla tries not to fidget as she sits i the seat, her eyes looking over the others present, mentally taking their measure to her own standars. As Captain Droga enters, Arrialla simply nods, though there is obvious respect in that simple motion. As he speaks, a flicker of something lights in Arrialla's eyes, and by the end of the short speach she is leaning forward against the table, watching the man.
"What is this Viraxia like? Are there indigeonous peoples? What species are they, and their traits? Are they warriors? How are they organized? And is there a notable history of this planet we should be aware of?" comes the young woman's firm voice, a voice used to commanding.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **Alicia** (2007-10-08 22:19:02)

Marlena listens calmly as Captain Droga speaks, casually adjusting her grey cloak to cover her lap and legs. When Droga finishes and allows for questions she asks, "Are there any known supporters in the vicinity of Virixia?

---

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-09 12:16:53)

Droga waits until the hail of questions has ended, then proceeds in a calm voice.
"Viraxia is a small planet on the Outer Rim. During the war, it was captured by the CIS, but reclaimed without much opposition as they were pushed back. The people of Viraxia has since been living in relative quiet, touched only by the war as it was used as a temporary place to harbor refugees. It is populated mainly by humans, and its civilisation is centered around three settlements, of wich the main in called Throth. Since then ending of the war, Viraxia has made an effort to remain neutral, showing support for neither the Empire or the Rebellion. As far as we know of, there are no rebel cells active in the system, but neither does it contain an imperial garrison. I would advise that you carry the mission out secretly. If the wrong people would learn about your intentions, things would most likely become more complicated"
Turing his eyes to Harsgault, Droga smiles.
"The reason, my friend, for us to choose you five is just that. You were all summoned here in order to foster cooperation between rebel cells. But as it is, we are short-staffed and ill-prepared to undertake this operation, and thus we ask that you do this. Also, it will serve as a splendid opportunity for all of you to form bonds that may help later on"
"We have very little in ways of transports to offer you, but we have prepared a small, hypertravel-capable shuttle for you. As soon as this meeting concludes, I will take you there, and you will be on your way"

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-09 12:33:07)

"A shuttle? Lovely. I don't suppose it's too much to hope that it's armed and at all maneuverable? Harsgault gives away a clue to his regular occupation there, but otherwise shifts in his seat. The sooner gone then, the better for him. At least they aren't flying into an Imperial stronghold should Droga's intel be correct.

---

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-09 12:58:52)

Arrialla wrinkles her nose at the suggestion of a covert mission. The logic for it is undeniable. Still, skulking about hiding one's true intentions, ....
Arrialla simply nods where she sits now, seemingly satisfied. Her eyes trail over the group again, considering for a long, slow moment, before nodding to herself once more. Now, she waits to be escorted to the 'shuttle' waiting.

---

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **ganthet** (2007-10-09 17:22:33)

"A shuttle will do, what where you hopeing for a Corvett?" : We should get started, will we be able to get anymore equipment or are we on our own on this?" " Either way will work for me." Winter says without much emotion.

Marlena sighs as she considers the captain's response. "So it will just be us. Well I'm ready to leave."

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-10 06:33:18)

"IÂ´m sorry we canÂ´t provide you with more equipment than this, but our rescources are stretched thin as they are already. While the shuttle isnÂ´t armed, we do have managed to improve its mobility and shielding systems. DonÂ´t worry, it should suffice for the journey"
Droga rises and invites you all to follow him as he leads you down to the hangar and shows you your intended veichle, a slightly battered *Lambda*-class shuttle.
"We have logged ViraxiaÂ´s coordinates into the navicomputer, as well as the coordinates for a rendevouz point. When your mission is done, travel there, and we will be waiting for you. Good luck to you all, and may the Force be with you"

**The Bothan speaks**, "We should consider the fact that the empire has been hunting the remaining Jedi in a most aggressive and fanatical way. In my experience caution and preparation for any situation has saved my fur more than once . We should take into account that this may in fact be a trap to lure Jedi or Jedi sympathizers. It would not be beyond the abilities for the empire to set up such a ruse."
**Dax looks down at this data pad, and then looks up giving a matter of fact innocent look**," Of course it could just be a simple distress call."
*Dax gathers any information that will be useful about the planets climate & terrain, organizations, and useful bartering items that may help when they land on the surface.*

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-10 10:19:20)

The young human woman with the long honey-brown curls rises and glanced over at the Bothan. "Caution is wise. But you make another point you did not intend. The Empire has been hunting the Jedi aggressively. Now doubt they know the frequency as well as we do, and have no doubt heard this call. We must go and find the origin of this signal and end it before the people of Viraxia are hunted like wild animals in an effort by the Empire to stamp out Jedi Sympathizers." Arrialla nods to herself, having considered the options, and likely considered the same course of action.
"We must be ready for both scenarios is what I think. Now, we have the information we are going to get here, let us not waste our time, or the Captain's." With that, Arrialla turns, her arms crossed over her chest and simply walks out of the briefing room.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **ganthet** (2007-10-10 10:35:50)

Winter gets up without saying a word and heads for the door. Thinking to himself "*This is probably going to get me killed.*" Just before exiting thought the door he stops " Are we going to stand around allday or are we going to get this mission under way?" Then he starts out the door.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-10 11:30:53)

Trap or no trap, there is only one way to be sure in Harsgault's mind. Spring it and see what happens. Once in the landing bay the pilot spends a moment looking over the Lambda shuttle. "It won't likely fool an Imperial patrol, but she's a sight better than an Ghtroc escape pod for this."
Knowing time is likely going to be a deciding factor, the human rolls his shoulders once and walks to the landing ramp to board and begin the startup process for the ship. Sooner underway, sooner done.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **Alicia** (2007-10-10 11:45:12)

Marlena gracefully stands and proceeds to follow the others, pushing back strands of her strawberry hair out of her eyes in mild annoyance. As they walk she looks over at her new companions and considers them. [i]"At least if we are going into a trap, there's a chance we can fight or talk our way out of it."
When she catches a glimpse of the shuttle, she wrinkles her nose in distaste.

---

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **ganthet** (2007-10-10 11:57:39)

Apon seeing the shuttle Winter shakes his head. Think to himself *" Yep this going to get me killed"* "Well at least it will get us there and back, though I would go doing any tricks in the thing it is liable to fly apart." " I have seen worst though." Winter quietly boards the shuttle sits in the copilots seat and starts checking the systems for take off.

Despite its somewhat battered apperance, the shuttle appears to be fully operational, and functions as smoothly as had it been new when you maneuvers it out of the hangar bay.It doesnÂ´t rock more than usual when you make the jump to hyperspace and soon all you can hear is the humming of the hyperdrive, as space around you turns into the familiar sight of hyperspace.

Marlena walks around the transport, unused to be cooped up on a ship. She drops her things off in the crew quarters when she finds them before continuing.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-11 12:04:56)

Arrialla makes her way into the shuttle and sits behind the co-pilot's seat. And waits. What more is there to do, after all. She does not know how to fly one of these things, instead choosing to remain in the flight cabin instead of waiting in the cargo area. If there IS to be action, one might see it from from here, after all, rather than back there.
And there she stays, mostly silent, waiting to leave.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-11 12:56:27)

With the ship on course and in hyperspace, Harsgault now takes a moment to shift around some in the primary pilot seat. Without looking away from the lightsmear of hyperspace ahead of the shuttle he comments. "Anyone given thought to how we are supposed to convince this 'jedi' that we are not going to turn him over to the Empire? Assuming he's even still alive or that we find him at all." Finally rising and turning to walk back further into the shuttle proper he adds. "We have 1.25 days in here to figure it out."

*Dax takes the role as an able crew member aiding in any way possible. He monitors communications, sensors, and shields as the systems operator. The Bothan is vigilant and seems to enjoy the station he has chosen. As Dax settles into his station he replies to Harsgault* 
**Dax**, "Nothing fancy, I was thinking a simple greeting, like we are here to help."
*Dax's furry ears pull back some after he answers and he looks up at Harsgault, thinking that maybe Harsgault would take offense to such an undisciplined answer. Dax speaks once more to make amends.*
**Dax**,"I was hoping we would not need to convince the Jedi. Who ever set off the distress beacon knows that the Jedi frequency will only reach those that have such knowledge. Its in our favor that we are answering the distress signal, that means whomever it is needs our help."
*Dax continues monitoring communications and sensors*

### **ganthet** (2007-10-13 00:56:56)

" The likelyhood of the Rebellion being the only ones who have heard the distress call is slim, we wil have to find the Jedi quickly." "Have we picked up anything to inducate that the Empire knows of it to?" Winter says as he continues monitoring ships systems. He can't help but let the memory of what had happened to his parents enter his mind and then it is quickly dismissed.

---

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-13 03:20:12)

"Or it really *is* a trap." Harsgault gets a somewhat wry smirk on his lips as he steps out of the cockpit and into the hold where there's some room. No need to pilot a ship already on course in hyperspace after all. "Not this far out, Winter. I'm afraid you won't know that the Empire has two Star Destroyers covering the planet until *after* we make the jump back to sublight speed." It is as though that thought amuses the rebel pilot. Harsgault then sets about seeing to what kinds of sleeping arrangements everyone has for the trip. It wouldn't be his first night sleeping on a cold deck, but it's never prefered.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-14 05:15:22)

Dax,"The Viraxia system is remote, and the empire has little interest in the area, but the beacon has been sending its distress signal for over 2 days now leaving plenty of time for random communication sweeping to pick up. I also can not pin point the location, but possibly when we get closer to the signal strength we will have more luck. This signal is most likely a long distance beacon, not your run of the mil short range. This is what make my fur stand up, because not only do we have the empire to worry about, but any unscrupulous ears monitoring communications. Pirates, slavers and scavengers to name a few."

---

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **ganthet** (2007-10-14 14:58:02)

" Slavers and Pirates are the least of our worrys unless the reconise the signal for what it is." "At any rate we should keep monitering com traffic and scanners, a little warning would be nice." Winter turns his attentions back to the controlls. " I wonder if we could alter our course so that we come out in apostion so that it would be harded to be detected us so we can scan the area frist to see what is there?"

Marlena stepped into the hold in just her plain black dress, having heard the men discuss the coming mission. "We may also wish to consider a cover story as to why we have chosen to come to Virixia." Considers her own words and begins looking around the hold looking for anything of use.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-15 10:18:22)

Having grown quiet, Arrialla quietly listens and observes the little party as things are being discussed. Only once does the woman 'hmmm' softly to herself before glancing back out the viewport of the shuttle in the cockpit.
"For the Jedi, I suggest being open and speaking the truth. Anything else would do more harm than good," she offers at long last. "Once we are certain he is a Jedi, we found his signal, and have comet o bring him to safety before the Empire can."
Then Arrialla turns in the chair to look back into the hold. "As for why Virixia? Mmmm, we our scouts for a shipping organization? We go forward to barter for deals and the like." Then Arrialla waves her hand faintly. "Something like that at least."

**Dax**, "If we are looking for a cover story the only well known manufacturer is VirDev; a small medical supplies manufacturer. If we want to be more discrete there are a few smaller industries and businesses we can say we are doing business with. If I knew any more than that I would share it, but my knowledge of the planet is limited. This planet is full of refugees, we could say we are looking for a friend lost during the displacement caused by the war. Although not as discrete, it does allow us an easy cover."

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **ganthet** (2007-10-16 01:22:07)

"That would work for agood cover if the planet was a refuge for people displaced during the war, it wouldn't be out of the ordinary." Winter says apovenly " We are going to have to come up with a name for this friend so if the athoraities get involed." "You know that is going to happen." Winter says jokingly.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-16 10:33:31)

Having achieved a softer backing for his head, Harsgault settles himself down in the cargo hold in a seated positition. "The Empire is not in the habit of selling it's Lambda shuttles for private use, even beat-up ones. So good luck with your cover story. We'll find a nice quiet place to set down once we are over the planet. And for now, I'm taking a nap." With that, the pilot closes his eyes and lets his chin lower to rest against his chest. Surely he cannot be asleep just yet but it looks like he's trying.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-17 02:22:04)

Seeing Harsgault go to sleep, you canÂ´t help but thinking it seems like a good idea. With more than a day left on the journey, it makes no sense to try and stay awake all the time.
As the hours pass by, you are awakened by the proximity alarm, and as you revert back into normal space, you catch your first glimpse of the Viraxia system

---

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-17 10:50:25)

Harsgault is already settling into the primary pilot's seat, mouth wide as possible with a yawn. Seeing that all is normal with the ship, the jump to normal space goes well enough. And now it is time to get to work. "Passive scans for communications and ship contacts please. Let us see if we can get a fix on our 'Jedi." A rumble within causes the former Imperial to frown. He's hungry.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **ganthet** (2007-10-17 13:07:28)

Winter awakens when the ship jumps to normal space. Shaking the sleep out, he looks down at the controls checking ships systems and scanners.

Harsgault's gaze swivels back from his seat. "Arrialla, Marlena, you are on." He knows the diplomatic types when he sees them. Conversation so far has sealed that impression. His attention switches back to the shuttle's operations, begining to vector for the general region of the beacon's signal while maintaining a high orbit.

"So long as we are landing in the spaceport. We will be strangers. That alone will draw enough attention. We must be wary of our actions, and make sure we do not act any more suspiciously than needed." There is a faint pause as Arrialla leans forward to peer down at the planet from the screen in front of her. "We will need to clandestinely gain transport into the forest. Speederbikes or some other would seem appropriate."

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-22 12:16:18)

Switches are flipped and levers worked even as Harsgault brings the shuttle onto a new course into the planet's atmosphere. "One piece, four pieces. She'll land one way or another." Now that must be confidence inspiring for the others, not all of whom can see the smirk upon the pilot's lips. "So much for just dropping in and grabbing this Jedi without anyone noticing."

---

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-22 13:28:11)

Piloted by Harsgault, the shuttle sets down nicely (and in one piece) on the designated platform, located on what seems to be a spaceport on the outskirts of a large settlement that you can only conclude is Throth. You see several other platforms like the one you just landed on, and in the center is a large building, most likely where everything is run from. A few kilometers off, you see the sprawling city of Throth.
As you descend from the shuttle, you two persons coming up the ramp. The first is a well-built human, carrying himself like a soldier, with hardened features and a suspicious look. He wears what appears to be the uniform of the local law enforcement force. The other one is also human, but appears to be in his upper 50Â´s. He wears expensive clothing
and has more the look of a diplomat to him.
"Greetings, and welcome to Viraxia" the older man says. "I am Gerdan Amiz, and I was to understand that you are looking for a place to rest? If you follow me, IÂ´ll take you to Troth and show you to some nice accomodations. Will you be staying here for long?"
He waves toward the second man. "This is captain Gavram, the militia officer in charge of spaceport security. He and his men will conduct a search of your ship for any illegal goods or substances, after wich they will see to it that your ship is refueled and given maintenance. I trust thereÂ´s no problem with that?"

An eyebrow slowly arches at Winter as he speaks to the Space Port administrator. The woman's calm mask of a face then turns back to view the two men greeting the group, almost looking down her nose to them. "Really, I thought I said I didn't want to attract attention on my tour of the other systems," she drawls, ounding ever bit the diplomat her father wanted her to be. "I've never been given such personal greeting in any of the other spaceports. Well, none the less, I'm sure my father will be pleased to hear I was treated with such kindness," she notes with a dismissive wave, now waiting to be lead away. Under her breath, Arrialla makes the barest of whispers to the nearest person, "Be certain to scan for tracking devices."

Harsgault descends the entry ramp rolling his neck around the shoulders. Ready to lock the ship up once everyone has exited the craft, the human lets the diplomat do the talking rather than open his own mouth. For the meantime then he scans the cityline of what is around them taking note of what we can make out for the city's layout and matching it with what he observed on the way down.

Marlena walks down the ramp next to Arrialla, feeling quite pleased to be back on a planet. Her cloak is back on but the hood has not been drawn over her face. She pushes a strand of hair back as she takes a deep breath.
As Gavram's men begin to board the ship, she turns to them. "Please be careful. I have some medical equipment on board I would not care to have damaged. Certain that they heard her she waits with Arrialla for Amiz to take them to the city.

With everyone finished, Amiz leads them to a small airspeeder that brings them into the heart of Throth, where ha lands at what appears to be a reasonably decent hotel.
"IÂ´m sure that youÂ´ll be able to find a pleasant stay here. I have other duties to attend to, but if there is anything youÂ´d like to know IÂ´ll be happy to provide assistance. If you want to leave, your ship should be ready for departure in the morning, but if youÂ´d like to stay a little longer I have been instructed to stay as your guide"

"And if I wish a tour of the countryside around Thoth?" asks Arrialla in a haughty, demanding tone as she slowly turns an eyebrow towards the man. "As per my instructions by my father, I am to observe the cities and countrysides of planets so that my own home will become more flourishing and the TRUE jewel of the Galatic Empire. Therefore, I _will_ do so. You will see about transportation for myself and my entourage, yes?" asks the woman, more rhetorically.
Arrialla straightens as she slips off the air speeder, turning her gaze on the man with the full force that she can muster. "Also, my father will be most displeased if any know of my arrival here, or of the reasons. You will be certain NOT to pass this information on, especially to others of the Galactic Senate, won't you? I believe we can work well together, Amiz. Now, I am certain you are busy. Arrange for transportation for me. I have my own pilots," she offers with a wave of her hand in a random direction that just happens to be towards Harsgault.
"Also note to your superiors, I expect to be invited to a respectable dinner this evening. Do not keep me waiting on an invitation, Amiz," That said, Arrialla turns away and strides confidently into the hotel, pausing only to wait for the door to open for her before she enters and is out of sight.

Winter looks at Dax in bewilderment, then turns to Harsgault. Shuggs and moves to open the door for Arrialla. Thinking to himself *"This little lady will either get us in alot of trouble or get us where we want to go." " Either way it should be interesting."*  After Arrialla goes though Winter follows figureing he should at least look like he is her guard or something.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-23 12:25:50)

A tiny smirk, similar to the one he wore a short time ago in the shuttle plays upon Harsgault's lips as they are brought into the city proper. The pilot masks it somewhat by paying a good deal of attention to their surroundings and trying to lock in a good grid to aid in navigating later. Businesses, apartment structures, restaurants of varying caliburs. And the people too, from what species to what they wear.
Finally at the hotel, Hars continues to give diplomatic control to Arrialla as she seems to have everything well in hand. Following her into the hotel two paces behind and idly considering the differing accomodations she will achieve for herself as opposed to the others. *she'll get us where we need to go at least, that is certain* the pilot thinks to himself.

Clearly caught of guard by Ariallas bombardment of demands and instructions, Amiz offers her a small bow and answers in an obedient voice: "Yes milady, it shall be arranged"
After following you into the hotel and insisting on paying for your stay, Amiz hurries of towards the airspeeder, a clearly shaken look on his face.
Later the same night, you are all invited to a fancy dinner in the main dining hall of the hotel.

Marlena smirks in private at Arrialla's ruse. You seem to have them wrapped around your finger, Arrialla. Maybe we can do what we came to do and get out of here without arousing suspicions. The last part is said almost in whisper. In the room, she tries to glean any information she can about the surrounding areas.
((Edit: That is if there is access to the holonet or and brochures available. I guess it depends on how touristy the city is.))

Arrialla does not even nod to the man as he leaves. She simply follows the porters to her room.
In the rooms, she stays pretty quiet, letting others work on finding things for themselves to do, and to help the group's objective.
Eventually, when it is time for the meal, Arrialla walks out in a smartly cut ... dress. It has a high colar and is military in fashion in a dark blue. But ... really, WHERE DID SHE GET THE DRESS FROM? Did she ... bring it with her? ... And what other things does she have in that travelling bag of hers? Other outfits, perhaps?

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-26 13:14:30)

Following a span of time alone, Harsgault rejoins the group near to time for the dinner looking remarkably different. It appears that he has spent his time in seclusion remembering old skills and making himself, presentable. The hair is freshly washed and prepped for one. The pilot's clothes have not changed, but they do look to have been not only cleaned but pressed! The new look showing him to be quite presentable in the right circumstances, even his boots are polished and the belt buckle before him gleams in good light.
As Harsgault adjusts a sleeve and looks to the newly present Arrialla he comments, "If I did not know better, I would suspect you wanted a dinner with the local bigwigs just to show that off." Even so, the human does not appear to be suffering at all in either 'dressing up' or in Arrialla's doing so.

He reaches bihind him ajusting something at his back. " I hate these things, I don't know how I let talk me into this."

She also has traded her short black dress for a more formal long black one. She looks at the others and nods with approval.

When you are all ready, a servant comes and escorts you all to the dining hall. You see a nicely arranged table filled with various food from all around the Galaxy, thereÂ´s seating for each of you at the table, as well as a few empty chairs at the end of the table.
As you take your seats at the table, a small group of humans enters the hall, Amiz among them. They take place at the empty chairs, but one of them remains standing.
"I wish to welcome you all to Viraxia. I am Oleth, mayor of Throth, and these are my aides, of wich I think you have already met Amiz"
He seats himself before continuing, and turns his attention to Arialla.
"Amiz tells me that you are touring around the Empire on orders from your father, seeking inspiration that will make your own home more beatiful. However, he has failed to mention where that home might be. And I must regrettably say that I cannot recall to mind anyone among the nobility here on the Rim who has a daugther of such beaty"

Arrialla smoothes her militaristic style dress as she settles in to sit. Her eyes dart over towards Oleth, and a smile graces her lips, warm and pleasant. And oddly enough, the young woman has manners befitting the daughter of nobility as is displayed durring the meal. As Oleth asks his pleasantly scripted questions, however, Arrialla laughs lightly, a welcoming sound as she lifts up a hand to shake a finger at the Mayor. "Ah, but I have already said too much," she offers in an amused tone. "I am on strict orders by my father NOT to be discovered. Though, since you had already deciphered me upon my arrival, I would be remiss in not giving you the pleasure of hosting such a fine meal for myself and my servants and companions on this journey."
Those lips pull up even further in a smile, while the woman's eyes dance with the light. "I will tell you this. We are a small planet, with abundant resources to offer the Empire. And we will be joining the Galactic Senate shortly. There are just one or two items my father needs to secure and finalize, before we put forth our petition. But it will be granted. My father's mentallity is well suited for the Galactic Empire, I assure you," is offered in a tone all sweetness and honey, along with an undercurrent of deadly sharpness and cold.

Harsgault may not look like a servant, but then the question of just who Arrialla would identify as servant or companion is not answered, or asked for that matter. The immaculately dressed human rather takes his own seat, and a slight smirk as he watches Arrialla engage in her trade.

As the night moves around the room keeping an eye on the exits and hopeing this night ends quickly because there is alot of work ahead.

OlethÂ´s face remains a mask of diplomatic calm as he answers Arialla.
"Ah yes of course. We are most honored to have you and your companions as our guests here. As you may know, Viraxia was left in the care of neither the Republic or the Confederacy in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, and as such, we have been running ourselves independently. But in the recent time, the general opinion both among our citizens and our high council has drifted towards making a petition to join the Empire ourselves. However, we try to be open-minded, and the planet is still divided over the matter"
He smiles and lets his eyes pass over all of you.
"But I shall not be a bad host and bore you with the internal politics of our little system. Amiz has told me you were interested in touring the countryside of Throth. I have arranged for an airspeeder to be avaible outside the hotel in the morning. Might I offer you the services of an experienced pilot as well? or perhaps a guide?"

A hand is raised and waved briefly in an absent manner. "That is not neccissary. Forgive me for seeming rude, but I have a most experienced pilot in my contingent. I would be remiss in my duties to my people if I did not use such a person to the utmost of their abilities. For this is as much a training experience for my contingent, as well as myself," offers Arrialla with a honeyed smile and words as sweet as cream. "Though, if your guide would like to meet with the head of my personal security, to provide suggetions and ideal locations to enjoy the richness of your beautiful Virixia, I would be endebted to you, Mayor Oleth."
There is a pause between Arrialla's words as she lifts her glass to her lips, holding it there as she looks directly over at the Mayor of Thoth. "Mayor, tell me, do you have a family? You seem to kind a man not to. Please, regail us with stories of your exquisite planet and city, and of your own family, while we enjoy this fine dinner."

*Dax opens his comlink to answer*
*You here the bustling of the city streets in the background as airspeeders pass*
Dax answers,"Not much going on in the streets of Virixia other than the fact the people here are weighing the issue to join the Galactic empire. The people seem indecisive, all it would take is one great example by the empire and people of Virixia could be won over. Other than that, nothing really. Its not going to be cheap for transportation, unless you want to use ground speeders. We should really be thinking about moving now, and not about what desert is paired with which wine. See if you can move things alone, we need to make haste. Who know how much time we have."

No doubt, he either was bored or needed to relieve himself. It does take years to train some men into officers, after all," notes Arrialla as she lifts her glass to her lips.

"Alas milady, I do not have the luxury of having a family of my own. And I must regrettably confess that I doubt I would have time to give any family the kind of attention they deserve. My duties as the mayor of this city takes up far too much of my time. But then of course, one never knows…your bodyguard seems to have used the phrase *Ms*, if I didnÂ´t hear him wrong."
With that last comment he offers Arialla a most invitating look, and then looks out over the rest of you.
"Perhaps we should take this conversation somewhere else milady. It seems to me that your…companions…are not as entertained as you are, and I would be a terrible host if allowed my guests to sit and be bored wouldnÂ´t I?"

"Much like beauty, good mayor Oleth, entertainment is in the eye of the beholder. You must forgive the antsier of us for our lack of experiences in higher social gatherings, as well as myself for being quieter. I have in my time as Ms. Arrialla's companion and pilot, come to allow her the lead in social occasions. She *is* a far better socialite than I, or indeed many of those whom I have met in my travels in or out of her service." Harsgault's voice rings steadily while the well-trimmed pilot holds a glass of the local beverage in hand. That glass is sipped from then, a tiny flash of a look going to Arrialla before the glass is set upon the table once more. He will have to inquire about the nature of that drink later, but now is not presently the time for that. "Please do go on mayor." A pleasant smile follows the words as Harsgault looks interested in hearing what the mayor has to say of his city and world.

An eyebrow slowly rises above Arrialla's brow and the woman turns with a dangerous mein towards Winter as he speaks to her. She says nothing, and, in fact, her face is a cool, plesant mask, no doubt hiding all that seething anger beneath of afriendly veneer. Rising slowly, Arrialla nods to Oleth, "Good Mayor, do forgive this minor intrusion. As I have said, sometimes it takes years to train a good officer," she says, then pauses. "If at all," is then added as she turns towards Winter.
"I will take care of this minor intrusion, then we will continue our conversation as is fitting," comes Arrialla's voice as she moves to precede Winter from the room, gliding like a cold winter's breeze across the surface of Hoth.

Following a tiny nod to the withdrawing noblewoman, Harsgault treats himself to a little of the food offered before him. Fine bits of veggietables, or what he takes to be veggies. Lifting the glass of liquid once more, he spends a moment taking a sip from it before responding tot he mayor with the glass still held level with the chest and a small smile. "There is little enough to tell about myself, mayor. But always some. My formal training has been related to piloting and protection as you have likely gathered. Things in the galaxy may be more stable than they were during the Clone Wars, but they are nonetheless dangerous enough to warrant properly trained folk like myself to ensure safe passage. From there, a bit of negotiation and a nice paygrade brought me into the service of Ms. Arrialla, most lately upon this tour." Shifting a little in his seat, Harsgault glances once out the way Arrialla and Winter have gone before a look to Marlena, his own mood apparently still mildly amused and pleasant. "As for my own employ with Ms. Arrialla, it has been long enough to know her moods, if not always to know her mind.

Casting a final glance after Arialla and Winter, Oleth turrns back to Marlena.
"The Viraxian wildlife is very diverse, and you shall be able to spot a grand variety of growth. The fauna, IÂ´m afraid, is not something that tends to be very freindly to visitors. While there are several species living around our fair planet, most of them are predators that tend to react aggressively unless you outnumber them, at wich point they tend to run away"

Once Winter and Arrialla exit the room. " Sorry to pull you away but this planet is on the verge of going either way with us or the Empire." "Dax has been out doing recon around the city I think it is better if we try to leave frist thing in the morning before everyone is up, Find what we are here to find and then leave as fast as posiable, all we need is transport."

### **chibiamy** (2007-11-13 14:59:43)

Gliding out into the hallyway, Arrialla waits patiently for servers, waitstaff and anyone else to move out of earshot before she even looks towards Winter, an eyebrow rising upwards as she looks at the man. "That is … all?" is asked slowly as the woman's eyes watch him carefully. "You brought me out here, conspicuously, to tell me what we already know? And then to tell me we should leave first thing in the morning, something that was likely going to happen anyway and could have been discussed anywhere without prying ears? You decided to risk blowing ANY cover and credability we might have over those two sentances?"
Arrialla's tone slowly turns venomous, a serpant finding a weakness and striking as her eyes spark dangerously with anger. "Why are you here, Winter? To throw away any plans that we might come up with? Are you here to see that we fail in our mission? Is that why you were sent with us? Because that is what you are doing by acting so foolishly," sneers the well-dressed woman, falling silent as she straightens to her full height and looks haughtily at the man as someone passes by. Once the stranger is out of earshot, she gives Winter her most potent and intimidating glare. "I expect you to THINK about your actions from here on out. You are not to interrupt anything, unless it is TRULY important. You are not to speak unless it is noteworthy. Not this drivel of an excuse you have given me and pulled me out of an intelligence gathering meet. Now, go BACK to the hotel and prepare for our departure. I will see if transport can be brought tonight so we can leave as early as you want."
There is a faint pause to Arrialla and her words hold threat as she whispers, "Do you understand me?"

"Aah, the forest areas aruond Throth can make for a fine tour indeed. Although, if you are heading out there, IÂ´d strongly recommend you to bring Amiz with you. Those forests are vast, and without a guide you could be out there all day and still miss a lot of the more intereseting things out there"
"Of course, if you head into the woodlands, an airspeeder will only do you so much good. The forests are thick, and in most places, the only way to traverse them are by foot. If you plan on doing that, may I extend my offer to include an escort as well? One of ViraxiaÂ´s most vicious predator - the Whill - are found numerous in that area, as well as other lesser predators"

Harsgault takes a slight smirk to his lips and makes a politely amused sound even as he finishes another drink. Bringing the glass container away from his lips, the smirk turns into a more pleasant smile with a knowing look. "Depending upon your local laws and customs regarding such predators, you may aleviate the boredom some of Miss Arrialla's bodyguards are subject to. Hopefully things are more peaceful upon your world here, but elsewhere in the galaxy many bodyguards lose their spirit if they are not subject to danger at least once per week." The pilot resumes his meal for a single bite of what he presumes to be local meats before another tiny internal noise can be heard as he remembers something. "Speaking of getting there however, I trust you may be able to provide a suitable speeder, good mayor? I am certain a safety deposit can be made if you require of course. Though I've not had any accidents in recent memory." And thusly back to another bite of that meat. Quite nice stuff it is too.

Arrialla watches Winter quietly, coldly, saying nothing before she simply sniffs in disdain. "My world is in the midst of a civil war, lead by corrupted rulers, and millions have died because of them. I, myself, may have been spared some of these atrocities, but it does not mean I do not feel them, I am not appalled by them, that I do not see the pain and suffering with an uncaring face. I am not here because I am on some personal vindetta. I am here, because the Republic could do nothing and the Empire WILL do nothing. I am here, because I WILL help people, I WILL bring about an end of this unnecessary pain and suffering, this tyrrany that grips us. And I will do so in a manner that will NOT get the rest of the members of my squad killed. I wasn't questioning your loyalty, Winter, if you would have actually LISTENED to my words, I was questioning your intelligence."
With a sharp turn on her heel, letting the man leave without further words, Arrialla glides her way back into the dinner reception, her face calm, and cool. "Do forgive the intrusion, Mayor. It seems I have much training yet to do with some of my soldiers. He was over eager on my resting properly and at least has the dignity not to bring it up, in the manner that he did, in front of others. He will be returning to the hotel now," offers the woman smoothely, nodding her head to Marlena. "So, tell me, what lovely conversation have I missed?"

Harsgault comments with a glass of wine in hand as Arrialla returns to the table.

There has been quiet from Arrialla, and finally the noble woman just arches her eyebrow at Winter, before turning to Harsgault. "Secure the speeder. You will be travelling with us," she notes, before looking back at Winter. "The others are correct. One lone person with the speeder will only be an attractant to large predators. NO ONE stays behind," commands the woman as she glances around curiously. "We should be able to use leaves and fallen tree branches to cover the speeder lightly enough to provide some camoflague and not leave it too difficult to brush aside in case we need to make a hasty tractical withdrawl," continues Arrialla as she moves to start gathering up leaves and branches, intending to do some of the work involved.
"Now, Dax, can you get any sort of triangulation on that signal so we know where we are headed? You concentrate on that while the rest of us deal with covering up the speeder. Afterwards, everyone will maintain a watchful eye, but Winter will go first, in line, followed by Dax, Marlena, Harsgault then myself." There is a brief pause as Arrialla points to the pilot, the woman fixing him with her forceful gaze. "No complaints. You need to be protected if you are going to fly us out of here. I am not neccissarily the most important member of this mission now. All right, Marlena, Harsgault, help me with covering the speeder. Winter, you keep a watch-out for errant predators, Dax, work on finding the source of that signal!"

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **Thandrim** (2007-12-10 13:46:25)

The ride from the city streets to the wilds seems to have left Harsgault in a good mood. Something perhaps to do with the strong handling and excellent acceleration curve of the speeder. That humor appears to only be increased as the group prepares to set out to close upon their target, as evidenced by the smirk brazenly displayed upon the pilot's lips. Locking down the speeder's controls he comments, "The speeder will be fine with a little cover on it. Besides, you clearly missed that conversation about the local wildlife. Else you'd be watching for the predators Marlena just mentioned." Even so, the pilot pay cursory looks to the trees and shrubbery in search of both a little more camo for the speeder from ground level eyes, and hungry stares aimed for the rest of them.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-12-10 14:08:50)

You manage to make a good job of camouflaging the speeder. Confident that it will be secure, you begin your trek into the forest. The speederÂ´s sensors wasnÂ´t able to provide more accurate fixing of the signal than before, so youÂ´ll have to do it the old-fashioned way.
Walking in a single file, you search the forest for hours, seemingly in a waste of effort. But then as you hacks your way out of particularily thick undergrowth, you appears to have found what you are searching for.
A few trees have been broken and a lot of vegetation is burnt away, and half-buried in the ground, lies what goes for the remains of a Eta-2 Actis Interceptor.

A moment of nostalgia is the first thing that takes Harsgault as they discover the old fighter. Taking on the tiny and nimble craft had been part of his training senarios back at the academy. Yet a more present mind is required, and the hint of childlike glee fades from those eyes before the pilot stalks about the ruined ship examining it. His voice rings out from the far side of the ship from Dax's position in answer to the Bothan's request and comments. "More importantly though, just how long that beacon has been active." A gloved hand slides along the length of a hole blasted into the side of the small fighter, clearing away vegitation. "This fighter crashed quite some time ago. I doubt we'd find any tracks from the pilot *or* whomever might have recovered his body. So has the beacon operated all this time? Or was it activated… recently?" The way he says recently clearly indicates the possibility of it all being a trap.

An eyebrow arches on Arrialla's forehead and the young woman turns to look at Harsgault and Marlena. "All the more reason to be watchful and perceptive of our surroundings rather than enthralled with a crashed piece of ancient technology," notes the woman in a firm, wariy tone, before shifting her blaster and moving her position. She glances around the clearning, frowning deeply as she does so, before setting herself into something of a decent defensive position while she remains watching the perimeter in all directions. Oh, and her blaster is NOT set for stun.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-12-15 06:58:06)

Upon searching the cockpit more closely, Marlena makes a shocking discovery. It has fallen down into a small space next to the pilotÂ´s seat, but as she draws it out, she instinctively knows what it is: a jediÂ´s lightsaber.
In the meanwhile, Dax and Winter has managed to find a computer terminal that seems like it might be useable. With the damage the veichle have sustained though, there is a very high probablility that much of the computer systems have taken a hit as well. As Dax hooks his datapad up, he tries to access the memory banks of the fighter. However, there appears to be some internal damage done to the fighter, and his access attempt results in a large cloud of smoke and a shower of sparks.
An instant before, Arialla spotted something moving along the borders of the small clearing, but in response to the sparks and the sound and the smoke, a thundering roar is heard. Crashing through the trees comes a large, quadripedal beast with a thick hide, and a huge allotment of teeth and claws, charging straight at you. Based on the mayorÂ´s description, it appears to be a Whill, Viraxias most feared predator.
(OK, time to see what youÂ´ve got. Arialla and the Whill are each allowed to act in the suprise round. Arialla acts on Initiative 24, the Whill on Initiative 18.
The clearing is 5x4 squares, outside of that is the forest, wich may be able to provide you with cover.
If you want, you can all post your actions for round 1, but I will wait until I get a post from Arialla regarding her actions in the suprise round. Once I get that, I will make a post resovling the suprise round, and then I will wait for everyone to post their actions for round 1. So, obviously you can be able to make a better tactical choice of you wait. I will also not post Initiative for the other characters before the suprise round has been resolved, hope thatÂ´s OK with everyone)

Arialla spots the large beast a split-second before it comes crashing through the trees. Without hesitation, she pulls the trigger of her blaster and a blaster bolt buries itself into the beasts hide. Shrieking, it turns on Arialla and rushes towards her. As it lines up right in her sight, Arialla manages to pull of another shot that finds home.
The Whill rams Arialla with full power, blasting her breath away and nearly knocking her over.

Cursing himself for allowing the crashed fighter to distract him completely, Harsgault is left with reacting rather than acting. A situation no pilot wants to be in, even if he's not in flight. The carbine is drawn up fast however, the human swinging about on one knee with weapon leveled to throw searing bolts of light into the animal.

Bracing for impact, Arrialla still was not prepared for the force of the beast that rams into her. Sent flying and out of breath, the young noblewoman just manages to stagger to her feet. Gasping for air, and desperately holding onto her blaster, the young woman's eyes look about the clearing again, then attempt to keep the Whill's focus on herself.
Opening her mouth, Arrialla tries to sound a cry, and fails, the air still not returned to her lungs, and it burns so! None the less, there are some things that speak louder than words and Arrialla raises the blaster up with a bit of difficulting and fires at the Whill again. If the beast can be taken down shortly, then all is well and the injuries she has sustained are well worth the pain she now feels, and will be feeling for some time.
((OOC: Get up and fire again as many times as I can! ... I want that electrostaff now. I really want that. *silly grin*))

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-12-17 16:34:33)

Despite the pain coursing through her body, Arialla manages to pull the trigger once more. Still winded by the blow however, her aim goes far off, and the bolt flies harmlessly into the forest.
As Ariallas shot flies past it the Whill Shrieks and swings its huge, clawed paw at her. The claws buries deep into Ariallas flesh and sends her slumping to the ground, three crimson lines showing clearly showing in her side. The Whill brushes her aside and rushes for its next target: a human male standing a bit of from the others.
Despite his military discipline, Harsgault canÂ´t help but flinch a little as he sees the giant beast swipe Arialla aside with a single mighty blow of its paw. As the creature turns towards him though, he is quick to react. Out flies the Blaster Carbine, and he levels it on the Whill and opens fire. The bolts only scrapes the beasts thick hide though, seemingly to no effect as the rushing beast doesnÂ´t even slow down.
Reacting more on instinct than thought, Winter leaps to take cover behind the wreckage. Turning quickly, he pulls out his blaster and fires a shot that buries itself deep into the Whills leg.
Surprised at the unexpected result of his computer access and the apperance of the large beast, Dax stashes his datapad and bolts for cover in the treeline. He pulls out his blaster and seeks to get a clear shot at the beast.
Marlena, crouched partly inside the cockpit of the wreckage, quickly stashes the lightsaber and draws her blaster. Without a clear shot to the beast for the risk of hitting Harsgault, she scans the surrounding area for any other nasty surprises.
In the distance, you can hear a few shrieks arising, and the beast you are fighting rises another.
(Arialla takes 17 more damage, and will have to spend a Force Point if she wishes to live. Great job diverting the beast though <!– s:D –>![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!– s:D –> )

Seeing Arialla go down Winter leaps back over the wrecked ship rushing to her side. "Stay down!" He shouts. When he getts to her truns when he hears something else in the tree line. "Sithspawn! These things are everywhere." Winter fires a shot at the tree line hopeing to scare of what ever it is. "Marlena I need you over here Arialla is injuryed badly. I will cover you." Winter waves her over trying to portect his fallen friend.

Aggressive predators engaged in a staring contest. Well the aggressiveness ensures that staredown does not last as beast charges and pilot fires from his crouched position.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-12-20 04:47:32)

Arialla has fallen unconcious, but luckily the Whill seems to ignore her. Her breathing stabilizes, and she will probably live for a little while longer.
Stung by a bolt from Winters pistol, the Whill doesnÂ´t care enough to slow down. It slashes at Harsgault with its claws, but the soldiers armor manages to absord the blow, although it might require a new paintjob.
Staggering to the side but unharmed, Harsgault opens fire again at the Whill, but yet again his fire fails to penetrate the beasts thick hide.
As Arialla falls down from the attack, Winter charges right back over the wreckage, trying to circle the Whill in order to reach her. Hearing the shrieks in the forest, he becomes more and more certain that this battle needs to be ended quickly.
Surprised by the thickness of the Whills hide, Dax aims his attack carefully and pulls the trigger. The bolt goes wide as he donÂ´t want to risk hitting Harsgault, but as the beast twist itself a little, its hind leg comes right into the bolts path, taking a sour hit.
Hearing Winters call for help, Marlena rushes out of the cockpit. Once at Ariallas side, she kneels, trying to do what she can to stop the bleeding. As the blood is flooding out however, she realizes that more time will be necessary to deal with the wound.
(Marlenas First Aid check failed, one of her medpacs has been expended. Arialla is now unconcious and has spent one Force Point. Dax has also spent one Force Point and has +1 to his attack rolls for the remainder of the encounter.

```

Where X is the Whill, and s the ship wreckage (or the part of it thatÂ´s within the 4x5 grid of the clearing at least)
In excahnge for not being showing something like this earlier, Winter and Marlena got to Ariallas without any AoO from the Whill, and Marlena even got to do the First Aid check, even if itÂ´s normally a Full-Round action.

"Keep working, I will try to end this as quick as possiable." Winter says to Marlena. "I have you covered."

Faith in his armor has proven itself again as Harsgault regains his footing with the aid of a short roll. Maneuvering here he knows is well pointless, and in fact perhaps the best situation the pilot could hope for is actually to have the thing jump on top of him. At least there'd be no way to miss with the carbine... head crunching not withstanding. "Come on, pretty." The useless taunt flips from the young man's lips as he readies to take on the beast yet again.

As its claws slides of the armor of Harsgault, the dumb beast gets a surprised look on its face. As DaxÂ´s bolt slams into its leg however, itÂ´s thrown right back into its rage. This time it snaps at the soldier with its jaws, biting hard into his shoulder. While the armor holds, it has to hurt.
Grinning as the beast took his challenge literally, Harsgault pulls his Carbine up right into the Whills face, pouring blasterfire straight into its eyes. The Whill gives up a high roar in defiance and then falls to the ground heavily and unmoving, nearly crushing Harsgault in the process. From the forest, you can hear the sounds more furiously now, and clear enough for you to distinguish at least two different sources.
Despite their best efforts, Winter and Marlena fails to fix Ariallas wounds enough to bring her awake. Seeing the Whill go down, Dax rushes to join his friends, and together with Dax they finally manages to get the young woman to start showing lifesigns.
(The dice hates you Marlena, I had to make both Winter and Dax help you to succeed. Arialla regains only 1 Hp and is at -10 CT(wich includes moving at half speed), but she is now concious. Marlena has expended another Medpack. Harsgault took 12 points of damage. Dax still has his bonus to attack rolls, it wonÂ´t go away until I say it does)

"Time to earn your pay, Winter." Harsgault's words come a little forced due to the pain of that shoulder-crushing bite. But at least that is one of possibly several threats dead. A stray thought comes as to how he'd far prefer piloting the wrecked fighter than fight like this on the ground, shoulder wound or no. Little to be done about that now however. "Stay sharp and check your targets. Let's see how many trophy hides we'll be traveling back to the hotel with." Grim, yet amused?

*Dax does not like the idea of making a stand, but there is no way out of this situation. These beast are fast, and they seem to have the ability to track with their senses. Dax was astounded by his companions combat prowess, but more than one beast at a time is going to be difficult. After helping stabilize Arialla, he scans the area for the best and closest spot Arialla can take cover to gain her bearings; Dax not satisfied with what he sees he closes his eyes and with his instinct chooses the direction of the most defensive position that would lead away from the beasts incoming.
Dax let's the soldier's do what they do best, and he assists Arialla; playing bodyguard until she is secure.*

Arrialla is groggy, to say the least. However, she bites back the pain, and gives a nod of thanks to Marlena and Dax as she is revived. A moment to look over her wounds, and the woman just hisses, "Deal with this later!" Reaching out, obviously strained and hurt, Arrialla still takes up her pistol, then looks to Dax. "Get me to some cover, I am NOT going to run and hide when I can still fire a pistol. If it does any good or not, that doesn't matter. It's a distraction for those who CAN injure that thing!"

"All right, Dax finish getting any info off of the ships computers, Marlena help Harsgault move Arrialla to somplace with alittle more cover, then check him out and see how bad his injurys are." "I will keep you covered as best I can." "Hars when you are done with that we will cover and give Dax the time to do what he needs to do." "We are all getting out of this alive people."

You can all hear the Whill shrieking in the forest. While Marlena and Dax moves Arialla into cover behind some fallen trees, Winter and Harsgault takes up their own defensive positions and carefully scans the forest for any more Whill approaching.
After a few moments, they can see another of the large beasts slowly skulking through the forest. And they can hear another as well, around a hundred meters or so from the first one.
(All of you has cover, Dax, Arialla and Marlena even has Improved Cover. Dax has spent another Force point to gain +5 to all skill checks for the encounter, and he now has 3 remaining.

Harsgault frowns as he slowly rises up from having kept watch for more trouble while the others worked. "And may have been pulled out, if he left his lightsaber." The pilot looks over to where Arrialla is and shakes his head. Voice still low, he echo's her sentiments even though he had no heard her whispers from his position. "The Mayor is going to have a field day there. First thing is first then, if we've nothing left here and no sign of a trail... split up to get 'Lady' Arrialla into medical care while observing this place? Or just withdraw completely?"

**Dax**,"We know a Jedi was here or at least a weapon that belongs to a Jedi, and that's a good start. Its dangerous out here, but I have confidence in Harsgault and Winter's combat skills. I'm not a tracker, but I don't see any obvious tracks, and we know that this ship has been down for awhile now, but we still have not found the beacon. I say we tread lightly and continue our search, find a safer location so Marlene can do her magic, and find the missing beacon."

"I agree with Dax," says Arrialla as she sits up with a wince. "I'm stable for now. The bleeding has stopped and I just need to rest. Get me in the speeder, we can take it slow in there, or I can just lay low and help keep everyone in contact using it's comlink. Now, come on. We have a mission and that mission is our priority. What happens to me is NOT. "

Scattered roars from deep within the jungle reminds you all of the prescense of Whill, and probably other predators as well. While many might avoid you, you never knows what lives in these forests, and the body of the fallen Whill will surely draw the attention of carrion feeders in time.

Nodding slowly, Harsgault takes only a moment to look into the wilds after the sounds of nearby Whills and other threats. "Very well, step one then is up to you Marlena. A 'safer' location will be the speeder for certain. Perhaps we can get a better fix on the beacon itself from there as well..." The pilot looks ready to do many things at the moment. Fight, haul an injured Arrialla, or track off into the wilds looking for the specific source of the distress signal they have been tracking.

While some of you experiences momentary doubt wether Dax is actually taking the correct path, you starts down that path, moving slowly as to not attract any more predators.
After walking only a few hundred meters though, Dax stumbles across another find. Although not as spectacular as the crashed ship, it is a sight youÂ´ll remember.
What remains of a humanoid lies scattered across a small shrub. What species it was is quite hard to determine, as it has been ripped apart quite brutally. Among the grass and undergrowth, you notices a bloodied piece of cloth, wich upon closer examination appears to be what remains of the torso of a uniformed individual.

Needing to be helped is obviously irritating Arrialla, but for once, the woman keeps her mouth relatively shut. However, stumbling upon the grisly has her eyes narrowing. Sure, her stomach wants to rebel and up heave, but considering it was nearly ripped out of her chest, it refrains.
"What sort of uniform do we have there?" is asked calmly as she tries to hobble a little closer. "How long do you think it's been out here? That is likely a whill kill, isn't it? Is that the uniform of the planetary government?" the woman asks in rapid-fire questions. "We need to hurry and try to find this Jedi if they are still alive. That's our mission, to bring the Jedi back to the Rebellion."
With that, Arrialla begins looking around, in the trees, her eyes narrowed again, even as she starts to push Marlena away so the woman can examine the discovered corpse. The trees are scanned carefully all around them, and then the underbrush is scanned as well. Arrialla is now wary about being followed, that this Jedi might well be alive and is watching the group. Wouldn't it be nice if it was that easy?

As Dax goes about his gruesome work of finding something useful, Harsgault hears a shriek wich he can from the recent painful experience identify as a Whill. The cry doesnÂ´t seem to be very far off, but he is unable to spot the howling predator, and it seems you are in no immediate danger...yet.
After some rummaging, Dax manages to find a bloodied piece of clothing. It is brandished with a logotype, depicting a Whill against a background of a white circle with a red cross in it.

Harsgault's voice, almost more of a mutter than spoken word, is just audible and perhaps a little grumpy sounding. "Voices down people. We are still not alone, or safe yet." The human shifts a little, adjusting the carbine in hand while ignoring the soreness of his shoulder due to the previous encounter with a whill.

You decides to try and search the area to try and find more clues. Lying in the vegetation near where you found the body, you find a Blaster Pistol, its power pack empty.
You proceeds carefully with the search, not to awake any more of the jungleÂ´s predators, but not even after several hours fo search are you able to find anything that can give further insight in your investigation.

As the stars begin to light the sky, the jungle has now become the hunting grounds for hungry nocturnal predators. With all this to think about, Dax doesn't seem worried at all, it was this kind of adventurous field work that made life interesting.
Dax looks up at the stars and then into the darkened jungle path that was no longer easy to follow. He turns his head left then reveals a curious doubtful look, he turns his head to the right, and again he seems a bit lost, but not wanting to break morale of the group he confidently speaks.*

"I think your right Dax, we should get out of here." Picking up the blaster that the dead man had left.
"I guess it takes alittle more then this to take down some of the beasties around here." Looking at the body a question starts to form in Winters head. " Why was this guy alone. I mean we were warned about all the nastys out here and we bearly survived an attack by one of those things." "I can't see why they would not have sent a group out here instead of one guy."

The darkened jungle of Viraxia is hard to navigate, but Dax mananges to find his way back to the speeder without any unpleasant encounters. That is, if you donÂ´t count going through a marsh in near pitch-black darkness unpleasant.
The hour has grown even later, and it appears that Viraxia has a more lively fauna during the night. More sounds than the Whil shrieks can be heard in the night, and you can hear movement stirring in the jungle around the speeder.

Harsgault advances up the middle slowly, cautiously with carbine at the hip and held ready to fire. This course *does* take him on the shortest route to the speeder. The sooner he is in it, the sooner they can all speed away to safety. Though exactly where that safety will be found may be another matter. Legs bent just slightly, he stalks forward with Winter to one side. The pair *are* supposed to be the 'big muscle' of the team.

As you all listens patiently into the night, you can hear stirring of movement and life in the jungle. Winter, Dax and Harsgault forms a small perimeter around the speeder, while Marlena and Arialla settles near the speeder, Marlena drawing a glow rod that might come in handy to scare of any nocturnal predators.
Suddenly though, the small clearing where your speeder is barked explodes into a cacaphony of sounds. From over the top of the speeder comes a whole hoard of small, monkey-like creatures, screaming enough to make sounds rivaling the roar of TIE engines. All creatures in this part of the jungle must have heard it. In chaos and confusion, they jump and moves in all directions their small jaws working frantically to scream, make high-pitched sounds, and bite.
(Everybody but Dax was surprised by the little creatures, and the Initiative chart for the surprise round looks like this:
15 -> Dax
4 -> Monkeys
They are tiny creatures, with a monkey-like apperance, standing around 0,5 meters tall. They donÂ´t appear to have any claws, fangs, tusks or similar weapons, but they can make a noise : )

Luckily Dax has his wits about him, and quickly realizes the animals do not appear to be that dangerous, but the mass of overwhelming native quadrupedal creatures still cause Dax to take cover. More importantly Dax mostly ignores the small furry creatures and readies his blaster for anything that may have startled them and cause them to run in his direction.*

Dax gives away a short scream when the small beings suddenly appears everywhere. Not that it is heard though, over the chattering of the monkeys. He reaches for his blaster and moves for some cover by a tree, standing clear of the small creatures. As he realizes these things seems harmless, he quickly scans the forest for other life. Through the forest, still some distance away, he spots two all-too-familiar shapes coming in their direction: Whills.
The small monkey-like creatures swarms everywhere, grouping in clusters to bite, grab and thrash. Six of the critters drops down from the speeder onto where Airalla and Marlena are sitting, snapping with their jaws trying to get a bite.
The rest of the creatures launch themselves of the speeder, landing around or atop Harsgault and Winter.

Harsgault ouches as he's nipped by a wild monkey-thing, and angrily swats at it once even as the others are still trying to deal with the chaos. The pilot is swatting and kicking his way to the speeder even as Arrialla tries to get people organized, already of a similar mind. Once there he is all about firing up the engines.

As Marlena closes her eyes and makes a sweeping motion with her hand, two of the small creatures harassing her and Arialla is sent tumbling through the air, looking clearly surprised as they take flight.
As Harsgault shakes off the little creature that bit him, he heads for the speederÂ´s cockpit, and does what he can to fire up the engines. He realizes this is going to be close.
Arialla manages to scare one of the remaining creatues with a good imitation of their own sounds, something that draws a ferocios shriek from one of the Whills who are now charging your camp. She quickly takes place in the speeder, keeping her blaster level to provide cover for the others as they should begin their retreat pretty soon.
Dax and Winter unleashes an unified blaster barrage on the closest Whill, and DaxÂ´s attack bites straight into its thick hide, while WinterÂ´s bolt misses by an inch. Realizing the futility of trying to make a stand, they both make their way back towards the speeder, kicking monkeys as they go.
The small monkeys are being batted around and they are not liking it. As Winter makes his way towards the speeder, he is met by a flood of monkeys. He drops one of them with a blaster bolt, and dodges and weaves away from the remaining creatures, reaching the speeder unharmed.

As the closest of the Whills crashes into the clearing, the speederÂ´s engines roars to life. Harsgault isnÂ´t late to act, and punches the speeder straight into the sky, probably burning the Whill with the engines. It doesnÂ´t really matter though, you are all alive and well.

Arrialla glances at Winter and shakes her head firmly. "There will be no med center involved," notes the woman, her eyes narrowing on the soldier. "Our mission is still a clandestine one. I require only a cloak as we enter the hotel, I believe some water from our rations and a bit of fabric to clean our faces as best we can is all that is in order. We did go into the jungle, so if we walk in pristine that will draw attention, so seeming dirty is fine."
An eyebrow arches upwards and Arrialla looks over the rest of the group, considering something to herself. "The mission is paramount, not my injuries. That will not take much time to heal. I'm already much better than I was. Marlena will have the proper equipment to tend to these minor inconveniences of wounds once we reach the hotel."
There is a long pause, a meaningful one as the speeder hovers above the ground, rushing past trees and traveling quickly through the forest. "Remember the mission, not me," she intones firmly, before shifting to reach forward and put a hand on Harsgault's shoulder. "Good flying, good timing," she offers with a bit of encouragement, then settles back. "All of you did well. Obviously we know now what these dreaded Whills are and need to avoid them at all costs. It was a miracle, and obviously the will of the Force, that we brought down the one we did. Good job, well done," she says with a firm nod, before letting out a sigh in a breathy exhale.

Having stood near the corner of the room and next to the window overlooking a good deal of the city, Harsgault has kept quiet till now. Only the occasional rolling of his shoulder giving away that he isn't actually a statue. As Arrialla retreats into her bedroom, he just watches her go. Even when she has fully left the room he does not move more than his lips, eyes returning to look over the city.
"Now that she is set for a nap... High road then low road. I suggest that you three follow Marlena's plan first. Winter, you may not feel particularly useful there, but added muscle is often most needed when it's least expected. Afterwards you should probably come back whether you've got leads or not. If we check less reputable sources, we should be in force for it. Meanwhile I will remain here and make sure Arrialla does not get herself killed, or worse, engaged to the mayor."
He isn't smirking there, is he? Or.... *is* he? Difficult to tell, continuing to look out the window like he is.

Winter looks at the bothan and smiles. "Well kids I guess we are about to get an education Marlena, being this is your area of expertize I will follow your lead." Winter departs to check on his equipment. "If you two leave here befroe we get back I want to know about it, so keep the link handy and I hope you fair better then I did with her."

*Dax's has been listening to everyone, that's what he has always been good at, trained to blend and listen. Although this was not one of those sneaking around missions he definitely felt the vibe of the room. It was still all business, bu Harsgault has taken the reins. Dax shares Winters smile about his comment, and gives Winter a goo goo look while Hars's back is turned to them emulating that maybe Hars has the hots for a certain someone, over protective maybe, but it may be more Dax didn't know the full relationship of his new companions and half the fun was finding out.*
**Dax,**"As you command Harsgualt. Virtech is a well known business we shouldn't have a problem finding information about the location of there operations, but it may take sometime and credits to find out if anything is going on beyond there known business, if anything. I don't have much in the form of credits to do my job, so we will have to take a different approach. We have no authority here, so poking our noses where they don't belong is certainly going to put us in an compromising situation. We should find out if hunting Whills is legal, and second if there are any missing persons. We have the blood on this patch from the corpse, maybe with the right tools Marlena can identify the body."
*Dax starts to think, pacing the room a bit while talking*

After long considerations, you decides to do nothing tonight. ItÂ´s getting late after all, and you all feel like you could use some good rest. You follows AriallaÂ´s example, and goes to sleep.
The next day you all get up early, revitalized after a good nights sleep, and ready to get to work.
(OK, it felt like it was a little at a standstill at the last post, so I figured you didnÂ´t want to do anything during the night. Now you are fresh and ready to go.

After cleaning up and getting dressed he desides some food and Caf are in order. Picking up his Comlink he calls his team mates. "I am heading down for some breakfast anyone interested?" Leaveing his comlink on settting it on the table in the room. He finishes putting on his boots and gun belt, making a mental note to seeing about a holster and belt for the one he found. Putting on his coat he heads out the door. specking into his comlink."Last chance if anyone wants breakfast."

*Dax looks up with a mouth full of food chewing and smiling and nodding quickly signifying a resounding YES!*
*Dax finishes his food and sits back relaxing, but his thoughts drift to the mission and why they are here on Viraxia. It was an important mission and last night was dangerous which Dax's intuition told him was foreshadowing to coming events. A mauled employee of the VirDev left to rot in the forest seemed odd. Someone must be looking for the unidentified VirDev employee. A dead body is something that should be reported to the authorities, and under normal circumstances that's what Dax would have told his friends to do, but these were not normal circumstances. It was time now to start asking around about any missing VirDev employees, and report the missing body to someone.*
**Dax says to Winter**,"I'm started to wonder about the identity of that missing corpse we came across. It could be someone's father or husband and that concerns me. We should start our investigating, and I suggest we alert the local authorities or someone in charge like the Mayor, it may give us the trust we need to pursue our own agenda."

Winter looks around at the city and the people moving around their days just starting. It reminded him of his days with his parents, in whatever space port they happened to be in. Those days are long gone this is his life now. "Well I think I will have another cup of caf and see if there is any news that we might need to know about."

One could CALL it fashionably late, but the truth is, Arrialla was so annoyed with everyone she decided to make them wait. Feeling worlds better, the woman is dressed smartly, her hair pulled up in an intricately braided bun, her clothes looking neatly pressed. She makes her way down with the others, having long ago had food brought to her room, so she has already eaten.
She looks around, over the group, and considers a moment. "Very well, what was decided that is being done today? We've dallied enough. Where is Harsgault? Undoubtedly looking over the speeder we used last night, mmm?"

Arialla and Marlena have gone to the hotel service, inquiring if anyone has seen Harsgault leave the hotel. No one has, and there are no cameras or records present at the hotel that might have provided some help. The speeder however is still in the hangar bay where it was left the other night.

The woman looks around and frowns, eyes narrowing at nothing as she taps a finger absently on her thigh. "I do not like this. None of us will be going off on our own from hence forth.

"I am Arrialla Tehr'mar of Xeaus. Surely you recieved the announcement that I had arrived on the planet. Did not the Mayor see to it?" she asks with an upraised eyebrow, sounding more like a commanding officer than a noble woman. "I am here to take a tour of the facilities, and perhaps enter negotiations about opening a branch of the company on Xeaus. There will be many benefits, economically, for both sides in this arrangement."
There is a pause, and Arrialla arches an eyebrow upwards, her lips pursing into a thin straight line. "You are NOT going to keep myself and the head of the company wait, are you?"

"I am here to negotiate business.

There is a pause, then Arrialla lets her voice drop nearly half an octive as she straightens herself up and says quite softly, "Do you understand?" she asks menacingly.

Once out of earshot, Arrialla's features take on a very contemplative expression. "Obviously," she notes in a near whisper to the others, "We are going to have to find a more covert way in. Dax, if you could, find plans to that facility. Winter, you look over said plans with Dax for likely entry points, then scout them out. Marlena, can you work your magic and find out who is in charge of the facility, and what their likely contacts are and have been? And what sort of work they are known for, both the legal and illegal kind?" she asks as her gaze sweeps the area.

Being met with a less than cold response, you take the speeder back to the hotel. You have buissness to do, and the hotel seems like a good place to start from. As you try to find some kind of information on the VirDev facility, you are sorely disappointed. What little information is to be gained is only what VirDev themselves have made public, and that is not much. As dax guessed, VirDevs network is a closed one, and the only way to get acess to it is to use a terminal physically present at the facility, the system cannot possibly be acessed remotely.

**Dax**, "It's time we went to the Mayor, and start asking questions. Hars is missing and a dead VirDev employee was in the jungle, I think we have probable cause for concern. I've been thinking about the corpse we found in the jungle. We only found a blaster. It seems odd that we didn't find any sort of comlink or survival gear, or identification. We need to analyze the blood on the the piece of clothing and identify the body."

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-19 12:53:43)

Arrialla glances at Dax with a frown. "VirDev is the major business revenue for this city, do you REALLY think the Mayor is going to take any sort of action that would potentially upset them? If Marlena could not get us in, we are not wanted in. I do not believe the Mayor will fight for us in this."
The woman rises, frowning as she moves about the room, thinking. "Not to mention, the questions would arise as to WHY we did not report the body before now. Why would Harsgault be missing? And what, exactly, are we doing on this planet. Going to the mayor is exposing our mission to those we do not want to expose it to. VirDev, working with the Empire or not, is NOT on our side, and would no doubt sell us out to the Imperials if there was profit in it for them.
"I do not like this idea. I do not like it in the least. There must needs be another way inside. Do they not produce waste? Have we looked at other entrance options such as that yet? Just because it means we get a little dirty does NOT mean it is a bad option," notes Arrialla with a frown. "But do not mistake me, any of you, I want Harsgault back just as you do. However, he knew the risks when he signed on. Just like the rest of you did. This is about the mission, and that takes precedence. We cannot risk blowing our cover. We do need to retrieve him before any information about the Rebellion can be extracted, definitely. But that does not mean we should go running to someone we do not know for help when the going is difficult."
Spinning back around, Arrialla looks at the group. "Ben and Winter, you said you would ask a few ... discreet questions in perhaps the more shadier places of town. Do that. We need someone to scout for sewer entrances and the like to the VirDev complex. I am not the best at stealth, but am willing to do so, if there are no other volunteers."

"Sure we could. Me and Dax could check the local spots for info." "Hopefully it would cust us to many credits to get what we are looking for." Winter looks around kind of in mid thought. "We could see if there are any of there poeple that fequint any of those places." "I guess we could check out the local color. You up for it Dax?"

**Dax**,"That's my specialty. Winter help me gather information, in fact, everyone could help by asking around. I want everyone to go around asking about VirDev discreetly and don't draw any attention to yourself. Use deception and subterfuge as your tools, ask about the operations that go on inside, ask around about any missing persons as well. Facilities don't need armed guard out front unless its dangerous or worth protecting. I'm going to ask around as well, but I'm going to go a bit deeper. It will take few hours, but I will find us a way in and maybe if I'm lucky some more information that will help us. We are going to need to pull our credits together, this kind of operation requires incentive. 5000 credits should suffice if we can muster it, but I maybe able to haggle it down. Everyone give me all the credits you can spare. Keep your ears to the pulse of the people while you are asking around maybe we can find out if the Mayor or VirDev have Imperial sympathies. This will takes hours to complete, keep your comlinks open in case something arises and meet back here at 0800 hours."
*Dax moves out towards the room looking both ways to make sure its clear and nobody is watching, then moves off discreetly. He is alert of anyone that might be watching him, and he uses his stealth skills to blend into the crowds, using the cities terrain to his advantage.*
[OOC: Assuming everyone gives Dax their credits and agrees to let Dax do some information gathering then he will. First he will make a Gather Information to find out any rumors specifically about any missing persons and and Information about VirDev. Takes a 10 for all Gather information checks for rumors. After he is through finding and weeding out any rumors he will attempt to gather secret information about VirDev, operations, schematics (alterer ante entrances), computer access anything that could be helpful finding a way inside to a computer terminal. Dax will use a Force Point for the secret information check and activate Fool's Luck. During his time gathering information he will use Persuasion to haggle for price of the information, Taking a 10 for for this as well. If you are generious my Fool's Luck will last for the scene and I should get +5 to all my checks, plus if you allow the others to Aid me I can get bonuses as well.

All said and done, the party splits up, all seeking information in different places. Dax and Winter makes their way towards the more rough neighbpurhoods of the city, seeking information abput VirDev in cantinas, gambling dens and similar places. Marlena and Arialla seek their information in somewhat classier locations, travelling the streets and markets talking to merchants and shopkeepers.
At 0800 sharp, they all meet back to work through the gains of the day. As far as you can tell, AriallaÂ´s guess about VirDevÂ´s standing on the planet was right. They are in a position of great power, and have many of the higher politicians in their palm, and can get away with pretty much. Reliable rumors has it that they have been involved in more than one shady deal over the years, and they are even said to have been practicing medical tests on living subjects - not taken from the local wildlife. A spacer Dax and Winter ran into even said that he had been hired to transport goods from the VirDev headquarters, and that while loading goods, he had seen several persons dressed in the uniform of the Imperial Navy. As far as you can tell, he wasnÂ´t lying to you, especially after you payed him. During their walk, Arialla and Marlena was able to get their hands on something very interesting. The schematic layouts of the VirDev facility, complete with readings of maintenance areas and external entrances and equipment. VirDev isnÂ´t really a very open company, and getting the building company in question to release the layouts wasnÂ´t cheap, even though Arialla did a very good job in the negotiations. No one has heard or knows anything about a missing person though.
(Dax has spent one Force Point and should have 2 left according to me. All in all, the gathering of information has cost the group 3000 credits, you may split it as you will, just let me know so I can keep track)

*After the information is shared Dax's furry ears pull back pensively.*
**Dax**,"No word on any missing persons. I'm growning more concerned about Harsgualt's well being. When I heard that VirDev was testing on living subjects it was implied that they were humanoid. VirDev is definitely in league with the Imperials. What better place to do testing, on a planet full of displaced refugees that won't be missed. Let me take a look at those schematics."
*Dax uploads the information to his datapad and reviews the blue prints, and starts drawing his finger on a possible route of entry.*
**Dax**,"There are various ways of entry some more guarded, and others more accessible but involve more danger. These power lines lead straight to close networked terminals. I can slice into one of those terminals and see what kind of testing is really going on inside. It sounds like we are going to have to stick our noses where they don't belong and do some reconnaissance."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-03-22 06:08:50)

*The scematics is very complete, they show you the full layout of the VirDev facility.
It is a three level building, and as far as you can see, there are only three external entrances. The first is the main entrance, the second is a maintenance access hatch located on the side of the facility, and the last one is a similar hatch, located on the roof.* 
*The maintenance hatch leads to a series of acess tunnels that runs through the entire building, with two internal hatches on each floor. From what you can see, all kinds of wiring and power runs through those tunnels, electricity, fiberoptics, water supplies…
The first floor contains a large lobby right behind the entrance. Various rooms are scattered along corridors running to the left and right, no mention of what they are for. And straight ahead is a pair of turbolifts. Following the corridor to the back, lies a large empty area wich would seem to serve as a dock or loading area.
The second floor seems to be mostly offices, storage and laboratory rooms.
The thirs floor seems a little different, with only a few larger rooms, as well as a few smaller ones. No indication of what they are used for though.*

After paying 2000 credits towards the bribes, Marlena looks over Dax's shoulder as he looks at the layout. Looking at the third floor plans, she makes an assumption "This looks like a likely place for labs, either that or they are offices."

*Dax nods in agreement with Marlena*
**Dax**,"Yes, and I would like to know what they are working on in those labs. Especially if the Imperials have there hands into the business."
*Dax studies the schematic more closely*
**Dax**,"The entrance that will give us the least amount of resistance once we are inside is the maintenance hatch located on the side of the facility, but we will still have to bypass outer securities undetected. Hopefully when we are inside we don't run into any maintenance droids or facility workers. We should be able to access any area of the facility using maintenance passage ways and turbolifts."

"Well I am no expert on breaking into place but If I could take alook at the floor plans and if we have an idea of what the security is like then I my beable to come up with something that might work." " Just might need alittle time is all." Winter says with some confidance.

"Then we may have to create a distraction. Does anyone have any grenades or explosives? Even just stun grenades. Also, did you two," asks Arrialla as she looks to Dax and Winter, "Make friends with any urchins or the like that would be willing to say, randomly toss grenades, even of the stun sort, at the front doors to the complex as a distraction to draw attention away from the loading docks once we are inside. That should help us go undetected once we start taking the maintenance shafts. We'll need to hijack a shipment and place ourselves in the loading bay, can it be done? What do you think?"

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-25 08:55:59)

Dax looks over to Arrialla and favors her idea
'If anyone is going to help us by going into the jungle I am sure they will want compensation. I have an idea for a distraction, a bit far fetched but it could work. What if we use Virixia's wild life as a distraction, if we record the vicoious sounds of Whills they could prove to be a good distraction. Multiple recodinga on different recorders would prove even better, but getting the sounds will be dangerous. If I check the local data banks its possible that they are on public record, being that they are dangerous and well known.'
Dax waits for the others to share there thoughts so a decision can be made together

Dax thinks over the ideas so far discussed and is obviously not satisfied
'Maybe involving others in our plan isn't a good idea, after all we need to keep a low profile. If we are being followed or watched, which I have a sinking suspicion we are, then involving easily paid off thugs isn't a good idea. We need to do a visual sweep of the area we wish to enter, noting any surveillance monitors or guards. We can create our own diversion, something simple to draw the attentions of the guards to give me enough time to get inside.'

"The key to a plan like this, is the distraction. If it's a distraction that is logical and would make sense for the local area, which your contacts in the more shady parts of the city are likely to know. All it needs to be is a little something," notes Arrialla as she moves to the window, barely parting the curtain with the back of her hand and she looks outside with a deep frown, watching for anyone watching her.
For a moment the woman stays there, lost in thought as her eyes narrow at nothing in particular. Then with a sudden movement she lets the curtain fall back and she turns away looking back to the others. "We go in, we get our packages, we get out. The distraction will cover our entrance, Dax will hide our presence in the buildings security systems. We do not want to bring the full force down upon the innocents here. We use what we have. And what we have isn't alot."

'Its possible the maintenance hatch isn't guarded very well. We need to survey the area for a day, watch for guard shifts, and spot any surveillance. It's going to take another days work of reconnaissance in the field. Spending the day watching perimeter operations may give us an idea on a good distraction.'
Dax continually is looking over the schematics of the facility drawing imaginary lines with his fingers trying to memorize the floor plans
'If we knew who worked at the facility or where they like to hang out after work we could look into stealing someones uniform and security card. Someone could ask around about that while I do the recon. A desperate overworked man maybe, looking for a good time.'

"As I said," notes Arrialla calmly as she looks to the Bothan. "They get shipments. Intercept the shipment and walk right in with it," she notes calmly. "If there is going to be yet another day's worth of surveillance, we might as well check into the computers for the port here and see what shipments are expected."
Then the noble-womans eyes narrow as she looks at the Bothan, her lips nearly pulling back into a sneer. "I will NOT whore myself out, or allow another to do so while I am here, simply because you think it is a good idea. There are other ways around this problem and they have been presented already. THAT, my dear Bothan, is a plan worthy of the Empire and I will NOT behave like such! I have a moral compass," she hisses, letting the implication of her words hand in the air before she turns to look at Marlena.
"What are you thinking, Marlena. Let us hear your thoughts, please," notes Arrialla as she moves towards the other woman, trying to find a seat, her voice calm and almost sweet as she speaks.

Marlena glares at Dax in self contained fury as he proposes his idea, "That is something I will not do and I am insulted by that… plan." When Arrialla comes to her she has calmed down some. "I don't believe we should be hasty. We have no true idea of what is inside, what is waiting for us. Surveillance might give us the opportunity to discover that. If we can get uniforms and a key card however that might help us even more."

"How much longer do you guys thaink we have before this will become imposiable to acomplaish." Turning to Arrilla. "There is no harm in getting a little more info about what we are after."

'No insult intended princess, but in the field we do what we must to survive.' Dax concedes trying to hold back his smile toward Arrillia, losing his diplomatic tone.
Dax shifts his weight to right leg positioning his hand over his holstered pistol striking a roguish pose and you realize that this kind of work is everyday normal for the Bothan.

Dax proceeds cautiously to try and find the spacer he spoke to before. Not trying to ask too many questions, he proceeds slowly, but manages to finally track down the pilot at a cantina.

Marlena and Winter makes their way towards the VirDev facility. Getting close without being noticed is not an easy task though, since VirDev seems to have cleared the land around the building, even on the sides that is located in the directions of the surrounding jungle. It might be easier at night.
===================================
As Arialla waits, Dax returns and tells about the deal he made with the pilot.

Dax isn't happy about going in alone but its the only offer that they could afford without breaking the bank
'I have good news and bad news. The good news is I found the pilot that can get us inside, the bad news is he's asking for too many credits. I got him to make a deal to get me in for 500 credits, but I have to go alone. I am the best canidate for the job so I volunteered myself to speed up things. I am going to meet him in Docking bay 88 at 2130 hours.'
Dax speaks with an edge of sarcasm and humor
'I don't want to put anyone in a situation they may feel uncomfortable doing'
Dax definitely was referring to the previous plan the he had suggested involving Marlena and Arrillia and the reaction he got.

"We're not going to be able to accomplish much during the day. We should probably head back before we're spotted and come back later." She moves carefully away from the VirDev facility as not to draw their attention. "Would give us more time to prepare in any case."

Moving away from the facility. Winter thinks that they must be doing some high level work to want it as open around the building as it is. "Ya you are right, we should try later when it is darker." "They should have sent a commando team with us though. It might take more then what we got with us to get into that place." Winter takes Marlena back to the hotel to figure out what they before heading back. "Maybe Dax will have found what he was after and we will be able to get in."

After a while, Winter and Marlena returns to the group, and is informed of DaxÂ´s success. While waiting for the cover of night to allow them to do better recon, they studies the facility layouts even more carefully, trying to memorize as much as possible, not to get lost once inside.
In a few hours, the night begins to fall, and soon most of the city is covered in darkness, lit up only by streetlights and other small sources of light.

"If possible," says Arrialla, who has been quiet for the most part, "Get us inside as well. But if it will reveal your location, or take up too much of your time, it is not worth it. The best option now, if you are alone, is to get in, get the information we need, and find a way to get us all in in short order, and then make certain they have no idea you were even there."
The woman looks around at the others, considering for a moment. "Something is nagging at the back of my mind about this, and I cannot place it. Therefore, be exceedingly careful, Dax. I do not like you going in alone at all, let alone for any period of time. But if it cannot be helped, it cannot be helped."

"My thought on this was that Dax would go in, find out what he can get out and we could cover his egress." Winter says. He would like it if he was going in with Dax but there is logic in dax going alone. "I am not thrilled about this but it is the easyest why to get the job done. Alone soldier is harded to detect then a group, hopefully Dax can stay undetected and get out of there without being seen." Winter Smiles at his friend. "Don't make have to come in there and get you out."

Dax listens to Arrialla's words nodding in agreement, then turns to Winer and smiles.
'I wouldn't want you to have to break a sweat over me.'
Dax addresses everyone now
' Once I am inside, I will find the best point of entry with the least amount of resistance. Let's make the maintenance hatch our primary point of entry, if things change when I'm inside then I will let you know. Things may get messy, and we may need to get our hands dirty. I've set my pistol to stun, we don't want to kill anyone, just get information.'
Dax gathers everyones comlinks and sets them all to the same encryption code
'I've set our comlinks to an encrypted channel just in case they monitor transmissions. I will help protect our communication, but its not unbreakable. If that's everything? Wish me luck.'

Winter takes back his commlink. "Good luck my friend call us if you need anything." After Dax leaves for his part of the mission Winter checks over his equipment one last time and heads out with Arrillia and Marlena to check out the area surounding the compound. "Hopefully we will not have to get out of here in a hurry. Considering we are traveling on foot it would take us awhile to get back to the hotel or the ship."
Apon reaching the compound Winter trys to find the best place to watch the buildings. Also trys to figure out if the need arasies how best to get in and get without being seen. "Ok everyone keep quite and stay together as much as possiable. Any one have a pair of binocs so we can get a closer look?"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-05-12 14:17:32)

As Dax reaches docking bay 88, the time is getting close to the appointed time. When he enters the docking bay, he spots a YT-2000 transport, with its ramp down, and a few people loading cargo crates on it.
Seeing Dax enter, a man loosens himself from the rest, approaching the bothan who now recognizes him as the man he spoke with before.
"Ah, you are here. I was beginning to think you wouldnÂ´t show. WeÂ´ll just finish loading this up, and then weÂ´ll be out of here"
====================================
As Winter and Marlena gather their things to leave, Arialla checks her comlink for functionality, then starts to lay out the plans for the facility on the table.
"You guys get there alone, you will be able to move quieter if IÂ´m not with you. Besides, I can stay here and give you support should anything arise"
Settling the deal, Winter and Marlena leaves alone. As they reaches their goal, they begins to skirt along the perimeter, trying to find the best way to get in. It is easier to move around undetected in the dark, and while there are a few guards on patrol, they seem not to tale notice of the pair. As they circle the building, they searches the three possible points of entrance: The main entrance, wich is guarded by 2 guards at all times, and they seem to recall seeing a codelock there as well. The small hatch to the side, wich is hard to get close enough to take a good look at, and the loading area, where Dax will most likely enter.

"So far so good." Winter says to Marlena. "I hope this goes well, or we are going to have a fun runn all the way to the ship. That is of course if they don't lock down the space port." Winter takes a potion where he can't watch where Dax will be coming in at. "If you want to rest a bit you can. We might be here awhile. I will keep watch don't worry." He knows that Marlena probably not used to doing this kind of stuff but it is what the mission calls for.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **Alicia** (2008-05-13 14:13:40)

Marlena nods a thanks to Winter, then set herself up so she would be more comfortable, but still out of sight from the complex. "Hopefully once Dax is inside, he won't have any issues. The fact we practically rushed into this operation isn't going to help matters."

"You might want to get out of that crate pretty quick, or else you might end up in a storage compartment. Not much fun to be locked up there, I would think"
The workers behind you have finished loading all but a single cargo crate. The pilot receives a clear sign from them, and turns back to Dax.
"But we are in a bit of a hurry, so if youÂ´ll just get yourslf packed up and weÂ´ll get going"
==========================================================
From where heÂ´s standing, Winter watches the workers of the dock go about their work. He and Marlena takes quick shifts sleeping, waiting for the freighter to arrive.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-16 06:20:12)

Dax looks at the crate then at the man that still remains unnamed. His ears pull back and thoughts of betrayal brew.
'How nice.' Dax says with humor 'Does it come with a refresher' As he gets inside the crate.

---

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-05-20 15:46:11)

As Dax gets into the crate, it is banged shut, and stuffed inside the YT. Then it take off from the hangar with a slightly bumpy start.
After a while, the freighter sets down with a similarily bumpy landing, and the cargo is being unloaded. Dax does his best to stay silent and immobile as his crate is moved around, and finally comes to a stop.
==================================
As the night grows darker, Winter and Marlena suddenly spots a YT-2000 coming in for the loading ramp. As it lands, Winter recgonizes the captain as the man he and Dax met before, and he supposes that now is the time to be alert.

### **ganthet** (2008-05-21 02:41:07)

"Ok, this is it we will wait here and see if anything goes wrong, be ready to move fast if it does." Winter says to Marlena. "Hopefully Dax can get in and out without our help." Winter trusts in his friends abiltiys and knows they know what they are doing, but sometimes the best layed plan can go wrong quickly. " So I wonder why Arrillia chose to stay behind. We could have used her help in this situation."

### **Alicia** (2008-05-21 10:44:27)

Marlena yawns and turns to watch the base with Winter preparing herself for a conflict she most likely won't be much help in. "I don't know why she decided to stay behind. Though it could be a good thing she stayed behind, if anything happens to us she's in a better position to get in touch of the Rebellion and inform them of what is occurring here."

---

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-05-24 13:30:27)

Heeding the spacers words, Dax pops open his crate pretty quick and peeks out. The loading ramp seems empty, at least from his limited wiew. He notices slight humming sound though, and shortly he realizes that a force field has been activated to seal off the ramp from the outside. As he hears sounds in the distance, he hurries to get out of the crate, and manages to find some cover behind a power generator, most likely the one regulating the force field.
As he watches, a small group of labor droids arrives, and starts to haul away the crates that was delivered. When they have retreived the last one, they exits the ramp into the facility through a large door. The door has a smaller one next to it thatÂ´s assumable meant or normal sized beings to go through.
=====================================================
Winter and Marlena watches as the freighter unloads its cargo, and then departs. They notices a blue hue coloring the air in front of the loading ramp. A force field, to keep the ramp sealed away. VirDev seems to take security really serious. They cannot spot Dax, but after a while, they notices a few labor droid arriving, probably to take care of the elivery.

Dax opens his comlink to Winter and Marlena.

Dax takes out his datapad and looks at the schematics of the facility. Seeing no maintenance hatch access available in the loading bay he moves to the small door. He checks the door to see if it is open. Putting his ear to the door he listens to make sure nothing is behind the door. Waiting for Winter or Marlena to respond, Dax doesn't move from his position from the small door until he able to communicate with Winters and Marlena.

I will keep an open comm., but the volume will be low. Contact me only in an emergency, I'm going in. Wish me luck.'
Failing to find any uniforms or anything useful in the loading bay Dax moves to the door. He opens the door leading out of the loading bay deeper into the facility. His senses are heightened, keeping his pointed furry ears alert and eyes constantly scanning. His steps are taken carefully not to make any unnecessary sound, trying to not to be heard or seen Dax follows the datapad schematics.

Dax keeps on moving down the corridor, proceeding carefully further into the facility.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-06-02 17:21:13)

Dax slides quickly into one of the offices. It appears to be a pretty standard office: A few chairs, a desk, some filing cabinets and storage containers, and a computer terminal at the desk. He spots no form of surveillence gear inside. As the door quietly slides down beneath him, he hears footsteps coming from down the same corridor he was moving in.

Dax takes cover behind the desk, and he can hear the footsteps pass outside the door, and then start to fade away. When he is certain he is safe, he starts to rummage around the room, searching for anything that might help him in his task. He is out of luck though, the office seems to belong to some kind of administrative personel, and the only thing found are emplyment records, some financial documents, and other stuff of little interest. What is left seems to be to access the computer. Dax puts himself down if front of the scren, and starts to do his work. VirDev seems to have investigated heavily in computer security though, and hacking the computer is no easy task. After a while, it seems as if Dax has gotten through, but just as he is allowed access to the network, the computer terminates his access, and acreen flashing "Intruder Alert" covers the screen. He is guessing this isnÂ´t good. Not good at all.

Dax is caught by surprise, his ears pull back and there is a worried look on his face. He didn't expect the computer to be so difficult to slice. He failed at a most crucial task, letting his friends down and now endangering his own life. Dax started to panic, because he didn't think this plan through very well. It was only a matter of seconds before they arrived at the office, so he made a quick decision to move outside the office into the adjacent office. Knowing they would trace it to the office he was currently inside.
((OOC: Well that really sucked, So there was no way of knowing how hostile the computer was before I started slicing? Man I should have used Fool's luck, now I'm the fool that's going to get caught.

As the console locks down, and the alarms starts to go off, Dax realizes that something has gone very wrong. In the hastiest possible way, he moved himself to the office next door. And as he slid the door closed behind him, he could hear footsteps and voices coming from the corridor and the office he just left. He covers behind the desk, trying to stay as invisible as possible.
=============================================
As Marlena hears the sound of alarms in the background of DaxÂ´s transmission, both she and Winter notices the the two guards at the front entrance being alerted to something. They stands a few moments, apparently talÂ´king into a comlink, and then the moves inside the facility.

Dax can hear dampened voices, but he cannot make out what theyÂ´re saying through the walls or doors. Suddenly though, the door to the office Dax is hiding in opens, and he can hear at least two sets of voices speaking.
"...will check in here. I want a search team assembled right away. Whoever tried to hack out systems has to be in here, and I want him found!"
"Yes sir. What about the prisonsers sir?"
"Send someone to check on them as well. They seem to be quite crafty, and will be sure to try and use this as an opportunity to try something"
Dax hears quick footsteps moving down the corridor, and soon he can hear a single pair moving slowly into the office.
====================================================
Winter moves at high speed towards the facility, determined not to leave his friend behind. Marlena follows shortly behind him. Luckily enough, they donÂ´t spot any guards as they approaches.
(You have come about halfway to the facility. What you are in can only be described as "open terrain". No trees, bushes, or anything really, just empty ground)

Marlena continues to run after Winter, her medical slowing her down. As a precaution she pulls out her blaster pistol in an attempt to be ready for anything.

Winter continues to run to the building to save his friend. Thinking to himself.*"No guards so far thing might start to look up if Dax can slip past them and get out we might be able to pull this off."* Winter pulls his blaster and gets ready to take care of what ever happens. He shouts back to Marlena. " If they start shoting try to find cover if you can or keep moving you will be harder to hit that way."

There wasn't much time, a search team was on the way and only one man stood between the exit. Dax slowly pulled out his pistol setting it to stun, his movements were quiet waiting for right moment. Dax took a quick breath and didn't like the next decision he was about to make. Revealing himself with his pistol pointed at the mans face Dax tells him to move away from the door. Dax is looking at him intently and speaks with an almost intimidating voice.
'The next few decisions you make could save you a lot of agony, don't try anything stupid.'

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-06-13 16:16:05)

The man seems to be completely caught off guard when Dax appears. He starts to raise his comlink, but then notices the gun trained on him, and leaves it be. He raises his hands in front of him, his blaster hanging at his side.
"Easy now fella. I think you are the one who should think about what you are doing. There is a search team on the way, and you are outnumbered"
===========================================
Winter and Marlena reaches the facility without any guards still in sight at either the main entrance or the maintenance hatch.

Dax doesn't show any concern for the mans words, playing down the situation.
'Toss your comlink on the floor and your weapon.' Dax says with authority.
Dax knew this wasn't a game, and he had limited time so every decision counted.

"Ok now we just got to figure out what to do next." Winter thinks for a few seconds and then runs to the front of the building. "We need to find away to draw them to the front so Dax can slip out the back to safty." He turns to Marlena. "You got anything we can use to create a disturbance?"

### **Alicia** (2008-06-16 20:41:54)

Marlena takes a silent inventory of her supplies and shaking her head says, "Nothing I wish to part with. One of us could cause a ruckus on the other side of the building. Maybe that would draw some of their attention away from Dax."

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **ganthet** (2008-06-16 22:08:56)

Winter looks alittle disapointed at his friends answer, he has an idea. "Find some cover back here and cover Dax if he makes it out. I am going to head to the front of the building and try to to draw them there." "If he makes it out we call Arrillia and head for the ship. We are going to have to fly out of here in a hurry so if you left anything at the Hotel sorry but we can replace it." With that Winter heads to the front of the building and finds some cover then raises his blaster and starts to fire at the building.

The guard hesitates for a moment, but drops his pistols and comlink on the ground.
((The man wears uniforms similar to the ones the security guards was having, with a few details different, probably means he is guard commander or something. As far as you can see, he has no such things on him))
=================================================
Marlena moves to the side, trying to find a good hiding place. Winter moves up right in front of the building, raises his blaster and fires. The bolts rings harmlessly of the buildings surface, producing little other effect than to make a black mark in the wall.

'I wonder why a medical facility that produces the planets main source of pharmaceuticals would be holding prisoners. Armed guards outside, not very hospitable. Curious is it not?'
Hoping to gain some information from the guard Dax uses his subtle interrogation skills to try and gather information.
Using the same authorative voice,'Turn around, put your hands behind your back, you are going to escort me out of the facility.' Sarcastic humor follows,' Considerate it a date, but don't get frisky Bothans don't like it rough.'
Dax waits until the man's back is turned towards him and his hands are behind his back before he picks up the guards comlink and weapon. With his weapon pointed at the back of the man's head Dax moves back to the hangar making sure to close all the doors behind them. As they move to the door that leads into the Hangar Bay Dax opens comm. to his friends.
'I'm going to need a pick up at the Hangar Bay entrance, Hurry!'
Dax ends communications so that no names are spoken. Faces are one thing but in Dax's experience humans are not really good at distinguishing alien faces hoping this human security guard can't tell one Bothan's face from the next.
((OOC: As long as he follows Dax's directions then when they start moving to the Hangar Bay Dax contacts his friends. Let me know if we get the Hangar Bay okay. I can't believe this mission is a almost a total failure.)

The guard grunts back at Dax with a defiant tone in his voice.

However, he follows along nicely as Dax starts to move him at gunpoint along the way to the hangar.

Dax stops the man soon after he finishes comm. with his friends. He looks back over his left shoulder behind him but doesn't see anyone.
'What did you say?' He says to the security officer.
'What's up stairs?!' Dax demands. 'Keep moving!' Dax cuts him off before he could answer knowing the man wouldn't say anything. Dax quickens the pace to the hangar bay, pushing the man with the nozzle of his blaster nudging him forward. Dax wasn't sure the voice he heard was that of his prisoner, and nobody else was around, but he knew he needed his friends if they weren't captured already.

Marlena still hiding by the main door, seems stunned when she gets the message. Dax's message breaks her out of it and she takes a look around to make sure no one is around before making a run for the hanger bay entrance.

Hurrying his steps, Dax pushes his prisoner in front of him back to the hangar. Much to his dismay, as the door slides open into the hangar, he can spot two men wearing uniforms similar to those of the captive. Both turn around in unison as the door opens, blaster rifles in hand.
==============================================
As Winter looks around for anything that might help him create a diversion, he spots Marlena suddenly running towards the loading ramp.
As Marlena reaches the ramp, she spots Dax and what appears to be a prisoner of his, and also two armed men in the middle of the ramp. Unfortunately, the force field is still in her way.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **ganthet** (2008-06-27 01:56:09)

Winter moves back to the rear of the building. He wonders what was happening. When he gets close to Marlena he stops to ask her what is happening. "What is going on........" He notices that Dax has come out and has a prisoner. "Oh this could go good or bad."

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-27 07:56:23)

'No fast movements.' Dax says to the guards holding blaster rifles. Dax takes a more defensive position, using his prisoner as a shield and showing his blaster pistol pointing at the man's head. Dax's body language is commanding and his voice is strong when he speaks.
'Nobody has to get hurt, put your weapons down and step away.'
Dax says in a low tone to his prisoner,
'You are their commanding officer, make this easy by telling them to listen to me. No need for anyone to go home to their families dead.'
When Dax sees Marlena and Winters he is relieved inside, but tries not to break his concentration. Dax's wits were with him, but for how long he wondered. Waiting for the guards to make there move Dax readies his pistol to his prisoners head in case the armed guards decide to do something other than what he asked.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-07-04 15:46:24)

The guards looks at each other, and then back at Dax.
"ArenÂ´t you in a little over your head now, bothan? Think about it, unless you give up now, you will never get out of here alive"
They keep their rifles steady in front of them, but none of them are pointing them at Dax.
========================================
On the outside, Marlena and Winter can only watch the spectacle as they frenetically searches for a way to shut down the field keeping the loading ramp sealed of. On the far side of the ramp, they spots what appears to be a generator, but at the distance, thet cannot see any way of shutting it down, short of blowing it up.

'You underestimate my resources.'
Dax swiftly sets his blaster to deadly and suddenly takes a shot at the generator with his blaster trying to bring down the force field.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-07-12 11:02:07)

Dax quickly aims his blaster to the side, and sends a bolt straight at the generator that generates the force field. The shot doesnÂ´t seem to have done much damage, but after a few moments, the force field begins to flicker and then disappears.
((Okay, combat time. The Initiative is as follows:
Guard 1 27
Winter 24
Guard Captain 23
Marlena 21

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-07-28 17:21:51)

The guards seems hesitant to fire at Dax while he is close to their captain, and one of the seems quite suprised when WinterÂ´s shot hits him square in the chest. He staggers backwards, barely standing up.
The captain takes his chance to suprise Dax with an elbow to his stomach. Dax manages to turn away, but he cannot stop the captain from dashing away from him.
As the guard hunches over from Winters shot, Marlenas attack blasts him right in the head, and he falls to the ground with a heavy sound.
Slightly startled by his comrades death, the second guard sees his captain dash out of the way, and quickly raises his rifle to fire at Dax, but the shoe goes wide, missing the bothan.
((Only Dax has yet to act in this round. If people wants to play this by posting in Initiative order, then tell me so. I personally thinks it slows the game down too much, but if all my players want it, then IÂ´ll do it off course))

If you don't want us to use initiative then I'd suggest you don't post the order, I will just keep posting as if initiative didn't matter, but its kinda important especially when your going last and get to see what everyone is doing.

Mirana freezes a moment as she sees the guard she shot go down. Dax's call breaks her out of the stunned trance and she peers in.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-07-30 05:41:29)

As the guard captain dashes to the side, Winter quickly readjusts his aim and fires. The bolt catches the captain straight in the side, slumping him onto the floor next to his fallen comrade.
Seeing the other man fall, Marlena takes a few steps up to the ramp stairs, using it as cover, and fires at the last guard still standing. The bolt just passes the man, making him shoot a first look at the newcomers.
Seeing Winter and Marlena, arms at the ready, he swings around and fires at the woman halfway up the stairs. Even though she is keeping a low profile, the blast rams her shoulder, sending a jolt of searing pain through her body.
Seeing his allies get shot causes Dax to fire almost blindly, and his shot misses the guard by far.
((Marlena has taken 12 pts of damage and is moved -1 on the CT. Sorry Marlena, I used cover for you, but the guard got lucky. And accprding to my notes, Winter should have a +4 to attack rolls, which you should all be very thankful for : ))

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-08-03 09:14:24)

Winter sees Marlena take a shot to the shoulder, dropping down in the stairs. He lines up another shot, his bolt connecting with the guards armor plate, making him stagger and seemingly knocking the air out of him.
Being shot stings, as Marlena discovered. Focusing to stay conscious, she drops as low as she can, working to keep her breath steady and her mind active.
Certain he has downed Marlena, the guards turns towards the other intruder standing below the ramp. he is met by a stinging blaster bolt to the side, and the pain nearly knocks him over. In a fit of rage, he moves up to the egde of the ramp and unleashes a hail of bolts at point blank range at Winter, sending the soldier diving into a roll to avoid the shots.
His fur rippling with his anger, Dax fires at the guard from behind, his shot leaving a deep scorchmark in the floor next to his foot.

It was his failure of the mission that has brought all this pain to his companions, and Dax's anger at himself for his own failure fuels his rage at the guard. Dax fires again at the guard, taking aim and concentrating on his target.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-08-08 16:31:51)

Throwing himself out of harmÂ´s way, Winter barely gets a shot off, and scorches the bay roof before pressing tightly against the rampÂ´s side.
Catching her breath, Marlena pulls her blaster up and fires from the side. The guard, certain she was dead, is taken completely off guard. The blast catches him square in the side of the head, and the dead body slumps over the side of the ramp, landing just in front of Winter.
As the last opponent goes down, Dax casts a quick glance towards the hallway leading into the facility, and he can hear no sounds or see anyone.

He studied the holo-schematics of the facility layout for hours before the mission, but now when he needed his focus the most it was drifting to survival and becoming more difficult to remember the way. Dax shakes his head to regroup his thoughts...
'This way...' Dax says with as much confidence as he could muster. He tried to stay calm, but his heart was racing with anticipation. He let the force guide his actions now, even though he didn't know it was the force doing so...

Dax wasn't sure if her question was rhetorical, but he sensed she had an answer to her own question 'Yes.' Dax answered with certainty that surprised even himself. Dax takes his attention away from scouting for a moment and turns to look at her, 'I can't tell you how I know, but I just do. We need to move quickly.' There was uncertainty in the Bothan's voice and he was holding something back. If Dax told his friends he was hearing voices in his head they would think him crazy, and it was hard enough for Dax to believe he heard a voice, how could he possibly explain this to Winter and Marlena.

The turbolift ascends rapidly, and soon you reach the top floor. As the door opens, you can spot out into what appears to be a small lobby. Straight ahead of you, behind a desk with a computer terminal stands a guard with his rifle pointed straight into the turbolift. Next to him stands another guard, also he with his rifle aimed. The first guard speaks.

The second guard throws up his rifle and takes aim at Dax, and the shot catches Dax in the side, sending him spinning down next to Winter.

Marlena drops to her knees, quickly investigating her companions, and drawing a breath of releif as she feels sings of life in both of them. She is unable to give them any kind of medical care though, as one of the guards quickly moves over to them, leveling his rifle on her head, finger on the trigger.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-12 15:29:51)

The guards doesnÂ´t say much, but they just looks at each other, and exchanges a confirming nod. Then the guard slings Dax over his shoulder, while the other one hauls Winter of the ground, and at gunpoint, he leads Marlena on. They moves over to what appears to be a high-security door, and in the roof above it she can spot two surveillence cameras. The guard punches in a code and the door opens. They dumps Winter and Dax heavily on the floor, and pushes Marlena inside. The the door seals shut.
As Marlena looks around the room, she gets the creeps. The room is filty and dirty, and lined with benches holding various tools and mechanical equipment. In the middle of the room is what appears to be a surgeons table, albeit a crude one. On top of it lays a couple of sharp blades and a needle, along with some other medical equipment.
What catches her eyes though, is the man hanging on the far wall. He appears to be human, and wears little more than what seems to be the remains of some kind of robe. His body is dusty and bloody, and holds several bruises and scars. Quite simply, he looks like a wreck. On the floor next to him, she can spot another man, not quite as worn, but it still seems as if he has been through a rough time. She canÂ´t make out the exact details of his apperance, but thereÂ´s something familiar about him.
She is distracted by a damp groan from Winter as he begins to come awake. Alongside him, Dax begins to move as well.

Marlena checks on her companions before her curiosity and concern for their other "cell mates" overwhelms her and she moves toward them, checking on the hanging man first. She looks to see if she can somehow get him down, short of using the lightsaber.
"My, you boys are in bad shape," she says, not expecting either of them to respond.
She will also see what medical drugs are around that can help Winter and Dax get back on their feet faster.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-21 16:48:29)

Winter and Dax regains their footing, and through sheer willpower they forces themselves to stay conscious. As things stabilizes, they seem to be recovering a little.
As Marlena searches among the medical equipment, she notices that it indeed is very little that can be used to actually help cure a person. Quite contrary, she realizes that it indeed has to be a room full of torture equipment. That might explain the condition of the two fellows in the room.
She moves to examine the man hanging on the wall. He is held up by a pair of heavy chains, and she hardly belives she can break them by muscular force alone. The man on the floor remains unconscious as well, but she can see an arm extending from under the pile pf rags that covers him. In the middle of the underarm - right where the major arteries runs, she notices a series of punctuating marks, all surrounded by strange-looking green auras.

Marlena kneels by the lying man, investigating the strange green marks on his arm. As far as she can see, at the center of each of the marks, there is a small punctuation wound, and she suspects that the man has been infected with something. Seeking to further investigate the mans condition, she pulls away the rags covering him, and flinches in shock.

Upon further examination of HarsgaultÂ´s body, Marlena discovers green trails running along where the major veins runs along arms and even the neck. Whatever he has been exposed to, he has been exposed to it a lot. As for the man himself, he is unconscious, and she cannot even tell if he is alive.

Dax turns to Marlena for confirmation since she wasn't passed out on the way to the improvised jail cell.
Dax then turns to the tortured.
'I don't want to end up like Harsgault, we need to work together, and come up with a plan. I sure hope we are not under surveillance, who would be sick enough to watch someone get tortured? Let's get them down.'
Dax looks at the binders to see if he could bypass them using the torture tools as improvised lock picks or even cut them off, he looks at Marlena and notices the Jedi weapon still on her.
'Hmmm, well we have one advantage on our side, and if this one is who I think it is.. then we need to wake him up somehow.'

As you stands around HarsgaultÂ´s motionless body, the man hung up on the wall next to you starts to move. At first, it seems like it is just twitches and spasms in his body, but eventually, he raises his head and looks at the three of you.

"Dax see if you can find another way out of here besides the way we came in." Talking to the man hanging on the wall again. "How long have you been here?

"Do you know what they have done to him."

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope : Chapter One

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-07 16:04:22)

The man closes his eyes for a moment, seemingly to gather some strength.
"My name is Sidnas Vook, and I am a jedi. I have to say IÂ´ve really lost track of time, but my fighter was shot down in a skirmish over this planet. ThatÂ´s the last thing I know before I got here"
He looks down at Harsgault, a slightly saddened look in his eyes.
"I suppose he has been treated with the same kindness as I have, probably a little sweeter, as he cannot feel the Force. Too bad, it was nice talking to him when he got here"
The chains keeping him hanging on the wall seems to be quite robust, the same goes for the cuffs. It is highly unlikely that you will be able to break them with sheer strength. Among the gear in the room is various needles and sharp tools, most of it dirty, quite often with dried blood.

Falling in a pile on the floor, it takes a few moments before the man gets up on his own. Rubbing his wrists, he takes back the weapon, and for a moment he just stands there, feeling it in his hand.
"Yes, thatÂ´d probably be where I left it...suppose I lost it in the crash"
Looking at Marlena, and then the two other members of the group, he hits the activation switch, and the green blade flashes to life again.

Dax may have had his doubts about his ability to hack into the facilitys network, especially after his failure the last time, but he nodded anyway, decisively thinking not to repeat that again. Winter hauls Harsgaults body on his back, and nods towards the Jedi.
Sidnas drives his lightsaber into the door, and quickly begins to sever it from the wall. In a matter of moments, a big piece of the door falls outwards. Almost instantly, a hail of blasterfire rushes through the air, but all of it flies harmlessly of the green energy blade, as the Jedi wades out into the room outside of the cell.

At the other side of the room, a desk is located, and the two guards who met you when you were captured are over there, guns blazing.
Marlena stays close to Sidnas, keeping behind the protective shield of his twirling lightsaber. With a grim smile on his face, the Jedi presses forward towards the opponents.

HarsgaultÂ´s condition appears to be stable for the moment at least.
With swift movements, the Jedi bats the blaster bolt straight back into the chest of the soldier who fired it, and in the next moment, he extends a hand towards the last one, sending him flying into the wall, knocking him out flat. Deactivating his saber, he turns to his rescuers.

Slamming is fist down, "This is how I got us into this mess the first time. I will check to see if there is communication access and try to contact Arrillia first, we are going to need a pick up."

While Winter and Marlena picks the guards for weapons, Dax gets to work on the terminal, trying to dig up whatever he can find on VirDev, in the case that they makes it out of the facility alive.
Still, luck seems not to be on his side. The system rejects his evey attempt at entry, and it seems to be compleletly impossible to hack. In a few moments however, he realizes why. The terminal he is using has been cut off from the network, and can pretty much serve only to control a few systems on their floor: Various locks, local inventories, and some sort of security system.
Suddenly, Sidnas freezes still, and his lightsaber flickers to life in his hand.

The doors to the turbolifts opens, and inside you can spot a cadre of white-clad imperial stormtroopers, rifles at the ready. As the doors flies open, Dax, Winter and Marlena fires into them, sending two troopers falling with smoking holes in their armors.
As they watches the troopers go down, something tingles in the back of DaxÂ´s and Marlenas heads. Something...dark, but they cannot specify it more than that. Even Winter, steeled for battle, can feel a chill running down his spine.

The troopers seems to have been taken by initial suprise, but wells out from the lifts, firing away at their assailants, raining fire around them.
Winter and Marlena returns fire, felling another trooper, and Dax manages to take down another, but is forced to cover behind the desk at a return barrage from the troopers.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-13 16:46:42)

Dax and Marlena grabs Hars, and pulls hown down the corridor. Winter follows closely behind them, firing away at the approaching stormtroopers. In the middle of the corridor, slowly stepping backwards and working his green blade as if in trance, comes Sidnas, the troopers attention focused mainly against him. The Jedi is working furiously, but it is obvious that his strength will not last forever.
Suddenly, a swift sensation runs through Marlena and Dax, and seconds later, a massive explosion is heard from the end of the corridor, the walls breaking, duracrete flying all over, and smoke and dust fills the end of the corridor. From the rubble, Dax recognizes a familiar voice.
"This way, quickly!! Hurry up!"
Spurred by the voice, Dax starts to pick up his pace, and while Marlena does not recognize the voice, she can only keep up.
Hesitant to get too far from Sidnas, Winter initially starts to run, but turns around, just in time to see the Jedi slip in his defenses. A blaster bolt comes through, scorching a hole in his shoulder, and flinching in pain, he drops his saber to the ground and falls to his knees. As Winter tries to reach closer, the soldiers turn their attention to him and a barrage of blaster shots halts any advance. Suddenly, Winter can feel the very air around him crackle with energy.
Straightening his back, Sidnas stretches his hands towards the troopers, and from his fingertips arcs of white lightning leaps forward and into the soldiers. It crackles against their armor, shatters their visor, destroys their weapons, and forces them to their knees or sends them flying. And in a moment it is all over. Getting to his feet and clutching his bleeding shoulder, Sidnas starts to run down the corridor.
The smoke has lifted now, and Winter sees the same ship that helped to ferry Dax into the facility. Assisting Sidnas, he makes it onto the ship, and the moment he settles down, the ship rocks as it pulls violently away from the building. The pilot is apparently pushing the engines to their limit, and they can hear why as the familiar sound of Twin Ion Engines is heard shrieking outside. The ship rocks and twists, and they can all hear the sound of laser blasts hammering on the shields. Suddenly, it all falls quiet, and they assume the ship must have entered hyperspace.
((Okay, this would more or less be the end of Chapter I. Great playing everyone, hope you donÂ´t think my first GMÂ´ed game was a total screwup.

"I can take care of that for you." She indicates the shoulder here he was wounded in their escape.

"Well I hope they didn't want that shuttle back." Winter says slumping to the floor. "That was interesting to say the least. I hope her highness got off the planet before all the shooting started." Winter gives himself a minute to relaxs as the ship moves though hyper space. Resting his head against the bulk head and closing his eyes sleep would be great right now and he was tired of fighting it off anyway. As he listens to the hum of the engines he falls a sleep on the floor.

HarsgaultÂ´s condition appears to be steady, and he appears to have drifted off into sleep as Marlena puts him down. As she gets to work on Sidnas, she patches up his shoulder, ans she can see his body is still visibly trembling. She didnÂ´t know what exactly he had done back there, but it seemed to have taken its toll on him.
The Jedi rests down on a seat, and looks at her and Dax.
"Thank you for coming for me. And thanks to your sleeping friends as well. I suspect you may have a lot of questions. If you want, I will try and answer as best as I can"
