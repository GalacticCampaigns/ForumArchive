# [Avarna's Dawn of Defiance] A Wreched Hive

### **Avarna** (2009-08-06 18:38:26)

((Alright. So everything that happened before this is now Voided. A88 and Bucky are the only survivors from the team that went to Felucia, So the Rest of the PCs were recruited by Organa's agents to support them.)
The *Banshee* settles down on the landing pad in the city of Zarra on the planet Cata Nemodia. Captain Sirona Okeefe speaks. "Alright, We'll be waiting here for your return. I suggest checking out the local Cantina to try and get a lead on Darga."

Vuurasi looks around as she walks down the ship's ramp and she stretches her arms as her feet meet Neimodian soil for the first time. She notices the stark contrast between the delapidated land platform and the likely, pricey made to order ship which rested upon it. Her hand ran across the holster at her hip, checking the IR-5 was there, and her lips opened, "Better keep an eye on your creds here, or you'll find your money dissapear before your eyes." She smiles then, wondering if she could make the money dissapear from anyone else's account.
(don't see why I can't use my earlier post again...)

As he walked down the ramp with a clanking sound, the sun reflected sharply in A88Â´s new armor plating that OrganaÂ´s people had been so kind as to install before they departed. They had added a few other things as well, most notably the highly explosive armament that now took up most of the droids right interior. He felt alright though. While skill was his greatest asset - as it befits any true soldier - having nice equipment always helped.
As he walked past Vuurasi, he took a look around.
"Never really liked Neimoidians. Probably has something to do with their views on what droids are for. Actually had one tag along to Felucia. Not good for much other than talking though, and what he said was mainly whining"

Bucky walked down the ramp of the Banshee, looking around at the planet around him. As he walked, his power hammer leaning on his shoulder, his vibro-axes swinging from his sides, his blaster carbine nestled on his back, and his vibro-dagger hidden in the fur of his back, he thought back on the friends he'd lost back on Felucia. Those stormtroopers had gotten the surprise on them there. He'd have to make sure that if anyone tried it here, he'd deal with them *expeditiously*.
Turning back up the ramp, he saw Gaarbecca, one of his newest companions.
"Oaooscwo oowh, anahaoaoanwo rhrcooaoacworc. Ohwo'howo rrooao ohoorcor aooo waoo."

Xalzar looks around the landing area as if experience a weird case of deja vu.
"If we are seeking a Hutt, we should look where ever scum dwell and corruption runs rampant. My suggestion is a casino, plus it will be fun."

### **Thraken** (2009-08-07 08:12:42)

Surl looking business like and otherwise nondescript in his suit, immediately surveys the area upon leaving the ship. There's not a lot to see however, for the place he had heard of as a bastion of the Trade Federation's wealth looked more like a description of poverty.
He looks over the others in his group. A non standard, and *big* patrol droid and two of those huge Wookiees he'd heard about - *how does anyone understand their language? It doesn't even sound like a language!*
Musing for a moment, his thoughts continue. *We look like two completely different groups. A wealthy Falleen with his bodyguard and some Twi'lek criminal who's managed to hire a lot of heavy firepower. Or just likes furry guys.* He looks at the Wookiees again. *They* are *guys right? How do you tell?*
Understanding not what 'Whirl-toe-buck' says he answers Xalzar.
"A casino sounds like a place a Hutt would have a hand in, that is, if there's a casino still in business around here..."

"While a casino does sound like a likely place to find some traces of a HuttÂ´s involvement, I think perhaps it would be best if I did not accompany you in there. Many official establishments seem to have something against droids, especially casinos. My guess is that it has something to do with the fact that our processors actually has the capacity to perform the complex mathematical operations necessary to gain a huge advantage in gambling that most other lifeforms lack"
He made a gesture back at the ship.
"Perhaps I should try my luck at the local cantina instead, as the captain suggested"

"Sounds like the type of place I should have a hand in," remarks Vuurasi to no-one in particular, she turns as the droid speaks. "They won't have any issues as long as you don't try to gamble, and besides, it's easy enough for sentients to cheat too," she flicked a cred-chip up into the air as she finished speaking. Catching it in the palm of her hand before placing it back into a pocket. She begins to step towards the exit for the docking area.

"Nowhere near as easy as it would be for a droid that put his mind to it, but still"
The droid looked back up the ramp as the remaining crew members descended.
"LetÂ´s just hope they arenÂ´t too tight on weapons scanning"

Gaarbecca blinks as his eyes adjust to the natural light of the planet. Though the ship itself was comfortable the wookie as with many of his race rather enjoyed the open air when ever they can find it. Gaarbecca tramps down the ramp setting foot on solid ground, looking around the wookienods to his counter part kin then scans the area. Eyes wide open the wookie scout takes in all the sights as he veiws this city for the first time then his gaze sets out to his limits.

The General agreement, is to to go a cantina and try to find more information on Darga. This particular Cantina is ran by as you'd expect by a Nemodian.
(I'm assuming you'll be trying Gather Information checks, so include your skill in post)

Bucky takes the lead in front of the group, the comforting weight of his hammer in his hands as they walk towards the cantina. He knows that some of the others would most likely be better at getting information out of anyone they met, so he planned on being quiet. He'd just stand behind the others and growl at the right times.

As the group walked into the cantina, A88 looked around, trying to get a grip on the overall population inside. He hoped the others understood that they could not expect much help with negotiations from a combat-designed infantry droid, who had been designed by a species that lacked a lot of social grace. Instead, he focused on doing what he did best: Assessing situations, evaluating threats, and forming tactics.
((Perception +8 and Knowledge(Tactics) +8 to locate guards or other security systems, sniper points, escape routes, volatile interior (aka things to blow up ;D ), or anything unusual. General tactical evaluation, I figure I have time if someone is going to make a GI check))

Surl silently Follows Xalzar into the Cantina, all the while eyes sweeping the environs. The building features and those who happen to dwell within at the moment. He knows full well he isn't a talker with physical force the only way he'd be able to squeeze information. Probably not a good way to start things off.
Dressed smartly in his suit, he would do best at the shoulder of the well dressed Falleen than the scruffy Twi'lek or furries. He stands behind and to the side standing alert in the bodyguard manner.
((Perception +6 to find exits, get a look at all the npcs and anything of interest around))
((Aid another +0 for Xalzar's check when he's good and ready. Just because I can't think of any better function than the rich guy's tough bodyguard bit <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> ))

Vuurasi entered the cantina last and made special effort to give the appearance she was alone. She then walked casually to the bar, taking a seat before calling the barman/maid over. "I'll have a glass of Tarisian Smooth." She flicked a cred into the air, watching uninterested as it landed on the bar before her, "And I'd like some information..." She began.
Gather Information +9, Persuasion +9,

As the clawdite makes nice with the bartender, The rest of the party make themselves busy by intimidating the crowd of down on they're luck Nemodian civilians. A88 notices that several of the bottles of liquor on the shelf are considered fuel on other planets, but that's the most volatile thing around, except for his wookie companions. Largely its your standard space port cantina. One front door, but inevitably a hidden back door.
Surl fails to notice anything of interest. After about an hour, of asking about Darga. One of the patrons leans in close and whispers int0 Vuurasi's ear. "No one's going to talk about Darga, Except maybe Raden." He then slips a piece of flimsi down the back of the "Twi'lek's" pants. Then the Nemodian quickly leaves the cantina disappearing into the crowd.

### **Tempeste** (2009-08-17 18:21:54)

Vuurasi frowns at the gesture for a moment before realising the situation, if they were too scared to talk about Darga then it was just practical to slip a note discreetly. She nods at the barkeep and leaves the cantina, retrieving the note and examining it once alone.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-08-19 11:56:42)

After watching the cantina for some time, A88 drew the conclusion that there was nothing extraordinary about the place, pretty much the standard setup of similar places all around the Galaxy. Letting the others do their jobs, he decides to do what he does best, and remains close to the entrance. On occasion, he throws a glance outside, watching out for anything unusual.

Gaarbecca takes a seat more then content to sip a drink while keeping a watchful eye over his friends. The large wookie prefers to keep his back to the wall when he sits. No interested in anything too hard Gaarbecca only orders an easy drink and a side order of what ever the special is today.
The wookie scans the patrons sizing them up for any kind of threat to himself or to his friends. Seeing no real issues Gaarbecca continues to eat and drink maintianing a watchful eye on his friends activities.

Surl shifts slightly to make sure he remains flexible. Having stood more or less in the same place for awhile he tries to stay inconspicuous, however nothing can change the fact that he is overdressed for such a venue in his black suit.
After scrutinising the cantina interior for the nth time he notices Vuurasi leaving the Cantina alone. Judging that the chunky droid and the wookiee may be less noticed amongst the patrons, he regards the two in turn before indicating the exit Vuurasi just used with a look.

## Re: A Wreched Hive

### **Tempeste** (2009-08-28 20:12:05)

Finished examining the note, Vuurasi heads back into the cantina. She heads towards the droid who is closest to the entrance. "Well we've got our directions." She states discretely, the note indeed had directions to a warehouse, it was a safe bet that they'd find out more about the Hutt there.

### **Avarna** (2009-08-29 13:50:31)

Most of the buildings on this street look half destroyed or collapsed, and none of the damage is recent. Dominating one side of the street is a crumbling warehouse, which has the half-buried wreckage of a
landspeeder jutting from its front. The walls of the warehouse have large chunks taken out of them, exposing the building’s interior to the street.

"Well, this looks like a nice place. It´s a little weird seeing places look like this *before* I´ve visited them"
No one said a droids couldn´t have humor. Of course, it was a Trandoshan´s humor.

Seeing one of his companions exit Gaarbecca looks to the rest of the group then follows after him.

## Re: A Wreched Hive

### **Thraken** (2009-09-04 18:32:47)

Having assembled moved to the location of the warehouse, Surl stands a little awkwardly with the group in the war torn and neglected street.
"So... what? do we knock on a wall and wait for someone to answer?"
Entering the ruins of a warehouse inhabited by some crime lord... This is really not the kind of thing he does... He begins stepping along the opposite side of the street to the warehouse, trying to get a better angle to see into the warehouse.
