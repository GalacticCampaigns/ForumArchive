The year is 19 BBY and the clone war have raged on for almost three years now, with no end in sight. With the Confederacy of Independent Systems still finding resources and other means of waging war the Galactic Republic continues to look for ways to bring an end to to this war. As the war continues more and more systems join the Confederacy of Independent Systems, despite the fact the Count Dooku was killed. The Republic continues to search for the new leader of the droid army, General Grievous, however there have been disturbing reports that another leader has been spotted in battles recently.
You have all been summoned because of you unique abilities to find this new leader and gather any information on him that you can.
*************************
As you walk into the briefing room you see a large table in the middle with a holo-image of a large man in dark blue jedi robes, with the right arm missing. You can see the his left are is cybernetic just below the elbow as is his right leg just below the knee. The man has pale skin and gray, almost silver, hair pulled back into a ponytail the goes down past his waist. His right hand is wrapped up in bloody bandages. Draped around his neck is what appears to be a reptile skin of some sort the goes under his belt and still has the claws attached to the end the hangs over his right leg down to his knee. His left shoulder is armored and a lightsaber pike is strapped to his back. In the picture the man is standing on top of a droid tank with his purple crossguard saber stabbing a clone through the chest that he holding by the throat. (give me perception bonus if you take a closer look at the man or if you are a Jedi)
A man in black heavy Beskar'gam armor with a red cape hanging over his right shoulder is standing with his back turned to you. I doesn't take you long to notice the blaster cannon mounted to the right shoulder of his armor or the power hammer mounted to the left arm. The man's helmet is setting on the table and his is looking at a galactic map. At first glance he looks even bigger that the man in the image, but after a second glance you can see that the two are about the same size.
"Take a seat please." he says with out turning around. His voice is deep and you can tell that his is a high ranking officer from the commanding presents that his voice provides. "I'll fill you in on the the mission as soon as everyone gets here."

((Just a note: Yes I had apped Verc as a male, but then I found a pic that was too close not to use. Except it was of a girl. So with GM permission Verc is now a chick))
The doctor Verc Adlor was already sitting in the briefing room, her scattergun propped up against the end of the table, even as she wore a labcoat over her personal armor. Its helmet clipped to a special hook attached to her thigh.
"Hopefully, this won't take long. I have patents that need my attention." Verc replied, She'd already carefully examined the holograph, more to try to get an understanding of what sort of injury might cause the need for such drastic cybernetic replacement.

Karn arrived at the doors to the briefing room where outside the door stood a doorman. Karn stopped before the door and looked at the man. With a nod of his head the doorman opened up the door. "Master Starfallen, he is waiting inside." With the door open Karn stepped through, his Jedi robes flowing behind him as twin lightsabers hung from his belt.
Moving to an empty chair he saw the image that was displayed over the table. And a disturbing image it was. For it told of another dark sider that was helping the Separatists. Chase took a closer look at the lightsaber wielding man. Something looked familiar about the figure.
"Take a seat please." One of the rooms other occupants said . A heavily armored man with weapons glaringly obvious. The presence and tone of voice told Karn who the man was, Commander Al'verde Verd'yc. The leader of Gammas Squad a Black Ops squad with quite a reputation. "I'll fill you in on the the mission as soon as everyone gets here."
***This just got more interesting.***
With a nod the Jedi took his seat one down from the other occupant an attractive blond woman who was quick to speak up. "Hopefully, this won't take long. I have patents that need my attention."
***Ahh a doctor. This could foretell many things then. Just which one remains to be seen.*** Karn thought to himself as he made himself comfortable int eh chair.
**"Good morning,"** He said to the woman. **"My name is Karn Starfallen."**
OOC:
Perception +20 for the guy in the holo image and the guy in the mando armor.

Dorn entered the room fully covered in his modified armour, it resembled GTU scout armour though the plating had been replaced and it sported a red and white colour scheme. The Helmet had been modified to fit the breath Mask all Kel-Dor wore off world, though the integrity had suffered slightly for it. Underneath the left wrist was a small unit with a barrel pointing away from Dorn, it contained a sub-repeating blaster which had been wired into the suit's controls.
He walked slowly, almost cautiously into the room and stopped instantly when he saw the heavily armed warrior at it's centre. Dorn felt underdresed in comparison when he noticed the large blaster cannon mounted on his shoulder. His eyes scanned the room, noting the other's who had arrived before responding to the armoured figure, "I'll Stand."
The suit of armour wasn't the most comfortable thing to sit in, and a headache was clawing at the back of his mind, he needed to concentrate. He noticed the figure in the hologram and nearly shook his head in disgust, he'd worked in the shadow of the Jedi for a long time in the past and grew to dislike the amount of freedom they got compared to him.

Alpha -51 a.k.a. Stone didnt like having his command unit taken away with out a brieffing. Just a halo message with cords and time was all he received. Being a clone made him of no extisance to some people but a clone he was ans a commander as well. What ever he was needed for he would go with out question and get the job done.
Stone walked through the building with his kama sweeping to and fro. He carried his side arm and rifle with the rest of his kit stowed on the LAAT/i that brought him here. Being a commander had its perks. He walked wtih confidence and leadership. Upon entering the room he took a quick sweep taking note of all who was present at the current moment. Noticing the halo imiage he stepped forward to get a look at the clone that was being stabbed and then to the man stabbing him. He started taking notes on the unit of which the man was fighting on, surrounding terrain, and types of droids (Perception +16)
Stone also new a mandalorian soldier when he say one. He couldn't recall him as a training seargent and didnt recall merc's being hired by the republic. That armor was made to defend against sabers was the same kind Kal wore. A mark of honor it he wasnt mistaken. He looked over the man working the panels. (Perception +16 looking for rank of some sort or anything that might hint of if Stone knew him)

Walking in behind the clone, Wrrltobuck crossed the threshold of the room with heavy, thudding steps. Measuring at close to 2.4 meters tall, the heavy Wookie knew he was difficult to miss. Noticing the man in the heavy armor, Wrrltobuck couldn't help but feel a bit jealous of the large blaster cannon mounted on the man's armor. The soldier leading this meeting obviously subscribed to Bucky's preferred tactic; hit it. If it keeps moving, hit it again.
Nodding at the man's suggestion to sit at the table, Bucky slowly walked around the table with the holoprojection in the middle. He'd worked with the clone troops for a while now, and so had met a few Jedi in his days, though he'd never focused much on them. He certainly acknowledged their fighting capabilities, as well as the good they did for the galaxy. Yoda, for instance, was well known amongst the Wookies, and that carried weight. Bucky simply preferred the company of the "working" soldiers of the Grand Army of the Republic, the clones. Noticing Commander Stone, Bucky nodded his helmeted head, his black and brown hair waving slightly wear the heavy battle armor didn't restrict it's movement.
As he continued the circuit, he also noticed the human jedi, or at least Bucky assumed he was a jedi with those lightsabers hanging from his waist, though Bucky had to admit he had never seen a jedi wielding two before.
Continuing, Bucky noticed the human female in a doctor's smock with the gun propped against the table.
*Hmmm. A doctor that carries a gun? I think I like this group.*
Laying his eyes on the dark red skinned Kel Dor, Bucky admired the scars, which obviously demonstrated a fighter's personality.
*This group should be interesting to work with. I wonder if anyone speaks Shyriiwook.*
Walking along, Bucky found an empty chair and stared at it for a second or two as he did some quick math in his head. Bucky weighs around 166 kgs. With the armor, weaponary, and jet pack strapped on, Bucky wondered for a moment whether or not the chair would hold his total weight. Deciding to risk it (after all, who wouldn't design sturdy chairs for a briefing of heavily armored soldiers?), Bucky spun the chair around and sat his massive frame backwards on the chair, allowing the jet pack and bowcaster strapped on to his back to not sit against the back of the chair. Leaning forward, the chair gave just enough for Bucky's arms to reach the table, where he laid his power hammer. He decided to leave his Vibro-Ax swinging from its waist clip on his utility belt.
*Well, let''s see what was important enough to call this kind of a team together.*
Bucky sat waiting for the meeting to start.

Marina stopped just outside the door and let out an audible sigh. Exhausted from her most recent endeavor, she most eager for a night of rest. However, it appeared the Republic had more work for her. The work never seemed to end and sleep would have to come later. Brushing a black curl back behind her ear, she wished she had taken a few moments to make herself more presentable. Her mess of black curls was falling out of the band she had put it in made only worse by the fact she had taken off her visor, which she had stored safely away into a pouch. Having not had a chance to change, she was still garbed in her usual attire of green slacks and the black mid-drift tank top, the dark green jacket she wore over it was the only thing keeping her warm. At her hip, her heavy blaster pistol rested against her right leg next to her lightsaber. Her belt was likewise filled with the tools of her trade as a mechanic.
With a glance at the bracer computer strapped to her left arm, she verified this was the correct door and that she wasn't late, at least not yet. With another sigh she opened the door and took a step inside. With a nod to the armored man apparently in charge she shot the others a cursory glance, her dark blue eyes sizing each of the other participants in a glance. Looking each of them over she made her way to an empty seat and made herself comfortable.
A Wookie, a clone, a kel dor, and three humans. It almost sounded like one of the bad jokes a barman might tell. To keep herself from laughing she turned her attention to the holo image on the table her expression turning grim at the scene.

The message he had received had been efficiently written, to the point. It spoke of a meeting that he was required to attend if (he read between the lines) he was serious about helping the Republic and (again, he interpreted the meaning behind the words) he wished to test himself to the satisfaction of all concerned. It also warned him conditions of non-disclosure were in place and that he shouldn't share the meeting's time or place with any one. As if there was anybody to tell.
Karid approached the door at a brisk pace, realising without the aid of a chronometer that he was several minutes late. Not the best first impression, but hardly the end of the world either provided he not compound the tardiness by appearing uncaring. In all truth Karid cared a great deal, though less about the meeting and more what it represented: an official entry onto the stage he had once dreamed of alongside the Jedi who had once been his heroes. He was no longer sure he wanted it for the same reasons, and maybe on some level he didn't want it at all. But he needed to be part of it. He had the power to help.
The door hissed open as soon as Karid came into proximity, and he received his first glimpse of what lay beyond. A conference table around which sat men and women, most heavily armed and apparently ready for a fight to break out then and there at the briefing. Still, he too had brought weapons in case they were to set out immediately upon being briefed, though only his blasters were on his person while his wan-shen remained in a carrying case, separated into its component parts.
*I wonder if they'll take me for a gunslinger*, he thought in sudden amusement, *or maybe a sniper, considering the case?*
At least one of the sentients present was a Jedi, Karid realised, looking intently across at the human with the robes. Then, just as intently, he focused for a moment on the holographic image above the table, obviously taken during some recent battle and revealing another Jedi (or perhaps, a man who used to be one) with several cybernetic parts mid-combat.
*Perhaps*, Karid speculated, *our objective?*
'I apologise that I didn't arrive sooner,' he said genuinely, realising the attention of everyone present was focused on him.
He smiled, and moved around the chamber to a vacant chair. The light and baggy trousers and jacket (tan and white respectively) he wore made barely perceptible *swish* noises as he moved, and the footfalls of his soft leather boots were light on the floor. Surprising perhaps, considering that he was large for a human at six foot three in height and possessed of a broad-shouldered, muscular build. And yet, even his size couldn't truly be considered his most striking feature. That distinction might be claimed by the geometric-patterned tattoos on his forehead, along his jaws, and on his chin. Or equally likely bythe orange pigmentation of his irises, decidedly unusual for a human.
He passed behind Marina and sat in the empty seat beside her.
'I am Karid,' he offered to her with another smile, then looked around the table as though passing the original introduction around by eye contact for economy rather than repeat it for each person present.

"I should have guess that you would be the late one Karid. I am hoping that you shape up while on this mission." The man in the Beskar'gam armor finely turned around and looked at the seven people that had walked in. The first thing to popped out was the large scar on the right side of his face. It had been badly burned and covered the right side of his face starting from the middle of his eye. His right eye had also been replaced as it had a faint green glow to it. His green eyes locked on to each one for only a second or two, as if he was inspecting his own troops. "Before I start allow me to introduce myself I am Commander Al'verde Verd'yc. I don't care if you've heard of me or not I'm not in the war for galactic glory. I also want to make myself clear about one thing. This mission is very important for the Republic, however due to the war I'm sure you all know we can not send reinforcements." The man slowly pulled out a chair, threw his cape over his back, and sat down showing what looked like a kill record on the right side of his chest plate.
"Now the reason you have all been called here is simple. You need to find out who this man is and why a general of our own army has turned against us. Master Starfallen I'm sure there is something in the Jedi Archives that can help you find more information about him. I've already lost two of my men to him and almost lost my second in command, Second Lieutenant Wraith. I know that you have a strong thirst for justice Dorn but I need you to keep your cool on this mission. You will also be flying as support for the Void Prophet." He proceeded to hand out seven files and passed them to each person sitting at the table "We think he is currently in the Roon system. Seek him out and find out what you can. Marina your special opps training will come in handy here. Commander Stone you are are going to be the tactical brains of the operation. I can not accompany you so I'm send you in my place. You are one of the best commanders I know and I will trust your judgment on how the mission proceeds. Wrrltobuck you get to have the fun job. Your on this mission to make people think twice about trying anything. Roon is a tough corner of the galaxy, just try not to rip too many arms off." he added with a smile
Verc<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

You notice that the man also appears to have other cybernetic replacement his his right arm up to his shoulder and one of his eyes is yellow indicting that it might have been replaced as well.

</details>

Karn<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

You know this man. Master Smija Docol is very powerful Jedi who developed an defense against the force and is know as a lightsaber master. However it was thought that he died two weeks ago. You also notice that one of his eyes is yellow.

</details>

Marina <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

You know this man is Master Smija Docol. You also notice that one of his eyes is yellow.

</details>

Stone <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

You can tell by the way that the man is standing that his is a expert in close quarters combat, armed and unarmed. You also also notice a droid standing behind him that you have never seen in any battle before. As for Al'verde you knew as soon as he said his name that he is the leader of Gama Squad. You know that they are given the mission that other squads don't really want and most of the squads see their mission as a one way trip.

Karn listened to Al'verde as he laid out the basics. To find out about the person in the holo. Karn had an answer for him ready but held off till the Commander was finished. When his name was mentioned Karn gave an affirmative with a nod of his head. ***Master Smija Docol I thought he had died two weeks ago. Depending on the age of this holovid the data on his death has been gravely overstated.*** Upon closer examination of KArn noticed the cybernetic eye.
Karn leaned back into the chair and brought his hands together as the Commander continued to speak laying out the roles some of the others would take on. It was an interesting group to be sure. Two he knew. One well, who was Stone who he had fought alongside with a few times. The other, Marina, not so much. He knew her master before he died at Genosis. It was another reminder that he wasn't there. Another friend that had died in that battle. Instantly he began a relaxation technique to quell the feelings he hd to deal with many years ago from the aftermath of that battle.
The technique done with such practice was unnoticeable to the non Force sensitives. The other two maybe. He looked at Marina and the late addition to the meeting. Karid. The Force was strong in both of them though Karn did not recognize Karid from the Temple. ***Strong in the Force that much I can feel but not a Jedi. Another tradition perhaps?*** Karn thought to himself. There were many different Force using traditions throughout the galaxy not just the Jedi.
When the file was handed out he reached for it and opened up the folder. ***Roon system. Hmmm.***
When Commander Al'verde finished with a joke Karn spoke up and pointed at the holo. **"Commander, I can check the Jedi archives for more info but I can give you what I already know on the subject. The man in the holo is Master Smija Docol. He is very strong in the Force along with being a lightsaber master. I must ask though, how old is this holo? Word is, or rumor depending on how one views it, is that he died two weeks ago."**
Karn leaned forward into the table, the file open in front of him as he looked from the Commander and back to the holo.

"He's had an eye replaced with cybernetics," Verc said in an off-handed manner. She took out a holo marker, and indicating the eye that now had a yellow glow, then she took her marker and indicated his arm. "He's also had a total arm replacement."
She shifted, at the mention of the Void Prophet, and leaned forward, concerned. She looked around to the rest of the group, and sighed. Just imagining how hard it was going to be to get the wookie hair off the seats. "I'm Doctor Verc Adlor of Alderaan, The Void Prophet is my privately owned vessel. I understand that a private ship will probably get access to CIS systems more easily then a republic owned one. But shouldn't someone have asked ahead of time if it was available?"

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **simplyscribed** (2009-12-20 09:48:55)

At the Commander's reprimand Karid's smile faltered. He had been expecting some comment or other, but to question his being in shape? Knowingly or not, the Commander had touched on an insult with the potential to wound a Matukai's pride. There were of course reasons for his lateness, but the tall man chose to keep them to himself. The Commander would no doubt not care nor even be impressed by the chain of events that had occurred while Karid was on his way to the briefing.
*Besides,* he thought, *from his point of view there is every reason to believe I am an unworthy addition to this group. I am the untested upstart whom has been forced upon him to test. He is predisposed to dislike me because of it*.
That, too, surely had to be the reason Karid was the only member of the group with an unstated purpose on the mission (always assuming, as he did, that the *Void Prophet* Dorn was supposed to fly support for belonged to the only other person present not mentioned by name, the female in the doctor's coat). He was the odd man, totally unwanted, and he would have to deal with it and prove his worth.
*Not the best of starts for my contribution to the war effort*, he reflected sourly.
Karid flipped through the folder presented to him, scanning it to glean whatever hints that might leap out at him, though he wasn't expecting huge returns on the endeavour. Surely the salient points had already been mentioned? The target was suspected to be in the Roon system, they were to go there and use their combined wit and capability to track him down.
Then the Jedi spoke up and provided an identity. Karid looked up, listened, and focused his attention on Karn Starfallen. A familiar name attached to a familiar face, though as yet dredging his memories hadn't helped him make the link.
*Ah!* Karid had a sudden flash of realisation, *he was an apprentice while I was at the temple. Much older than most padawans. I didn't know him, but no wonder he seemed familiar.*
When Verc too spoke and confirmed his suspicion that the *Void Prophet* belonged to her, the ghost of a smile could be seen on Karid's features. A small victory for his faculties of reasoning.
'Surely your ship can be made available for such an important mission as this, miss Adlor? There are few worse threats to the Republic, or indeed the Galaxy, than a Jedi who has strayed into shadow and squandered his blessings.'
Karid's question to Verc was phrased and spoken politely, but he was unable to keep undertones of bitterness from marring his second sentence. As he gave voice to it, he looked at the holo of "Master" Smija Docol and for a moment his strange orange eyes flashed with anger.

"I won't pretend that I'll try to take him alive, if he truly is a traitor then he's too dangerous to live," stated dorn as he reached down to the table and picked up a file. He flipped through the pages one by one looking for any important intel on the system, was it controlled by the CiS, republic or just neutral? And what forces were they likely to come up against. He then turned to the doctor and added a question once she'd finished speaking, "The Void Prophet, what model is it? Weapons, defenses?" Dorn was quietly confident that The Red Giant could handle a confrontation with the CIS, it had a few times in the past and the tally of fighters destroyed was kept via markings near the cockpit. It numbered at over a dozen the last time he'd looked. He wasn't so sure about the Prophet though, he could give it support but he couldn't rescue anyone if it happened to explode in the middle of battle.
"I assume this is all... Off the Records Al'Verde? I hope that won't affect our pay."

Stone flipped through the file brisklt absorbing all the information as he was trained to do. Read fast work faster to get the job done.
"I don't recall it being said that this was off the record. If it was a large group wouldnt be assembled to take down one rouge saber jockey" said Stone in a strong commanding voice.
With no indication that his head had left the file he spoke towards the doctor. "This is a time of war Doctor Adlor a private ship can be reqresitioned in two ways. One way is your told as gear is loaded on to it the other is a message is left were you ship was saying thatnk you for doing your part in the war" he said with no indication of a joking manner.
Stone doned his helmet looking like all other clones except is eye had a saber slash across it from a previous encounter with a rouge saber jockey and he had longer hair pulled back and tied with something that was probley a weapon.
"Commander Verd'yc if this is a rouge jedi why are in fact the jedi themselves not taking care of their own? And if General Karn is present on the mission would he not be the ranking officer in charge of this mission?

Hearing the description of their mission, Bucky rumbled his contentment. Anyone who would turn on the clone troopers after all that they had done deserved what they got. Bucky picked up the folder of flimsiplast and glanced briefly through it. His role had been fairly well explained, after all. It was his job to be big and scary, something he did well.
Hearing the Kel Dor's comments, Bucky woofed in agreement.

**I agree with the Kel Dor. If this Hutt sucking scuzzbag has turned from his fellow Jedi and betrayed the clones that had served under him, then he doesn't deserve to live. The only reason I'd agree to bringing him in alive is if he had some information that the Republic could use. Outside of that, I believe that a slow and painful death might be in order.**

"My ship is a CEC Hwk-290, it has a single blaster cannon, but I've significantly upgraded the shields, and have added a medical suite." Doctor Adlor answers the question, as she leans back into her seat, and crosses her arms over her chest. In responce to the clone, Verc picks up her comlink, contacting her droid aboard the ship. "Cue, lock down the ship. Thank you."
She waits a moment, to see if anyone else speaks up to translate for the wookie. "Our Wookie friend, agrees with the Kal Dor, but adds that should the former Jedi have useful information he be taken alive."

With a nod Marina accepted her role she was to play within the party, curious as to whether Verd'yc second in command had recommended her due to their previous work together. With a sideways glance she looked over at Karn, growing curious as she sensed what she supposed was anxiety. She couldn't blame him Her attention immediately turned back to Verd'yc upon hearing Wraith had had an encounter with this rogue Jedi and she added a question of her own to the mix. "Has Second Lieutenant Wraith made a suitable recovery to make a report?" As she asked she began a flip through of the report, looking for relevant information and trying to recall what she could of the Roon system and of the once Jedi Master Smija Docol.

Al'verde looked at each of the people in front of him and shook his head "I told Master Yoda that this was a bad idea and that he just needed to leave it to my team." he muttered to himself as he rubbed his forehead. He slowly looked up and addressed Verc first "You work for the Republic correct? Well then why are you withholding resources that can help a vital mission? And Dorn I'm not asking you to attack him. I am ordering you to fly support and if you kill this man with out him attacking first, you'll be lucky to be a bouncer in a bar of the outer rim when I'm done with you." he stood up and pushed his chair in "As for who is in charge General Karn is in charge but I need you Stone to make sure that the mission is not compromised. You need to be the tactical brains of this omission. General Karn is to take all advice you take, you are the second in command of this mission."
He started walking towards the door "Wrrltobuck is right about one thing, if he has useful information get the information, but again do not engage him unless he attacks you first. And do not even think about provoking him into attacking you." He finely looked at Marina as he reached the door "Wraith is just about back to one hundred percent. He may be a good place to start. Ha can tell what this...Master Smija Docol. Oh so you know this image was taken one week ago. The clone's name in that image is Wreckage. He joined Gama squad last month." he said as he walked out and closed the door behind him.

"Well," Began Dorn as the Mandalorian exited the room, "Lets hope this traitor isn't easily offended." He tried to guage the responses of those in the room whils he placed the file back on the table and checked the hologram one last time. The wookie he felt he could trust, he'd heard of how they were honourable and brave creatures. He wasn't so sure about the others, they'd all have to prove to what extent they could be trusted.*Maybe they should be worrying about trusting me, if I'm here to escort them..*
"I've never been one for following rules or regulations, I'm.." He stopped as pain spiked through his head and he closed his eyes hard for a few moments. "Where's Wraith?" He added a number of seconds later.

Stone grinned in a way that only a clone could get away with as he re donned his helmet. Grabbing up his rifle he slung it over his shoulder of his battle hardend armor.
"General i'll be in the hanger bay preping for launch we'll be ready to leave as soon as you give the order you have my comm frequency it hasnt changed. If the good doc's medical ship is lacking what you would call firepower and speed im certain that we can find a ship worthy of hasty get away and have the guns to pull it off. Anyone willing to kill the men who protect him isnt worth osik to me alive but an order is an order".
Stone exited from the room without another word with the speed and grace of cat on the prowl, he had a mission to do and people to look after even if they didn't think they needed to. Heavy steps echoed the hall as stone was trying to figure out what that droid was in the image and what was the best course of action to take down a saber jockey that took down a company.

Seeing the Mandalorian leaving the room, Bucky took that as the end of the meeting. Standing himself and grabbing his hammer, Bucky walked around the table towards the human female that had been called 'doc'.
**"Rooohu cakworaor cacrorcahahohooooor? Aoacraao'c rcrarcwo wwoorc achuscrawhc.

Turning towards the Kel Dor, Bucky woofed and barked, in what he hoped would not be a threatening manner.

Turning away from the others, Bucky lumbered towards the door with all the grace of a nerf, most unlike Commander Stone. Turning towards Verc at the door, Bucky woofed some more.

As soon as Al'verde and Stone were out of the room, Karid closed his copy of the file, settled back in his chair, and grinned.
'People such as these are impossible to please,' he murmured. Karid was familiar with the type and their philosophy of "do it my way, or get out of the way". Presumably a type he would have to deal with more often after associating himself with the Republic's military.
Truthfully, he could not say he had taken to either of the two military men, and could only hope he might play his part on the mission (whatever it may turn out to be) without his sphere of activity overlapping too much with Stone's.
Dorn's joke elicited a chuckle from Karid, and a nod of acknowledgement. Then his orange eyes turned on Karn.
'It would appear your second-in-command has given himself leave, General Starfallen,' he comments, adding (as he watched Bucky move toward the door): 'and so I will direct my enquiry straight to the top of the chain, in an effort to get some manner of plan in action before things break down. What now? Shall we regroup at Doctor Adlor's ship while you check the Archives and this "Wraith" is interviewed?'

"A pleasure to meet you too, Wrrltobuck. There are enough wookies serving in the GAR that I took the time to learn it. Most translator droids just get in the way in a busy ward." Verc replied to the wookie as he came up and spoke with her. She's clearly still unhappy about the turn of events.
She turns to the Kel Dor, "Wrrltobuck says, that he understands the desire for vengeance against a traitor, but it would be worse for him, to be turned over to the Republic."
Turning to the Jedi, she says simply. "Listen, No one's told me if I'm being included in this witch hunt because my skills as a doctor will be needed, or if I just happen to have the most convenient Ship. But the *Void Prophet* is my home away from home, and it apparently too much effort to properly request its use."
Verc didn't feel she was being unreasonable. She just wanted some acknowledgment that this was beyond what she'd signed up to do in the service of the Republic. She was a doctor after all, not some special forces spook.

'I'm in no position to tell you whether it is your skills or your ship that made you part of the team, Doctor,' Karid interjected, 'but I for one will be very glad of both. It is a comfort to have someone of your qualifications on the team. I will also be very happy to have a means of transport, and hope my presence aboard your ship will not prove too much of a burden.'
'in any case,' he added with a wry smile, 'at least you know you *have* a role to play. Mine, it appears, remains to be seen.'

Noting the anger in the human's voice, Bucky stopped at the door, holding it open, and cocked his furry head to the side, hair spilling out of the helmet. Noting that no one seemed the slightest bit interested in making sure that the team's medic was in a pleasant mood, he woofed and barked...
**"Coo, rooohu'rcwo huwhacraakakro aoacraao aoacwo cacahak ahc rhwoahwhrr hucwowa ohahaoacoohuao rooohurc akworcscahccahoowh?

Bucky hoped his attempt at diplomacy didn't blow up in his face. There was a reason he didn't try most of the time. He stunk at it. However, since no one else seemed to care about this woman's feelings, and since her cooperation **was** necessary to use the ship properly. Not to mention how much better a friendly medic would be than an unfriendly one.

Marina nodded adding her own sentiments to what Karid said to quell the doctor's ruffled feathers. "It is indeed a great pleasure having someone of your skills along, Doctor. I hope you will in time forgive Stone for his assumptions that we would force you to allow us access to your ship, I understand completely how one such a place could become a sanctuary and I share the sentiment that I hope we won't be intruding too much." Looking back around the table at the remaining faces she said. "We haven't properly introduced ourselves. I'm General Marina Numa." She hated the military title she had been force into, but if they were to be properly introduced she might as well use it. Often than not, she was using some other alias so for once it was nice to be called by her real name. "It's a pleasure to meet all of you." Her attention turned to their Wookie companion. "And I must say it is the first time I've had the pleasure of working with a Wookie, Wrrltobuck. You'll be happy to know that my master insisted I learn your language." She grinned at Bucky, the smile not quite reaching her tired eyes. While the loss of her master still saddened her, she could only be greatful for that which he had taught her.
Marina tossed the file back on the table, leaned back in her seat and crossed her arms. Sitting down, she was discovering, was hampering any success she was having staying awake. It was taking an increasing effort to hide her fatigue. With any luck, she could get a good nights rest before they arrived in the Roon sector. But before then she knew she would have to check up on her friend, Wraith, and gather the necessary information and equipment for the mission. That thought in mind she turned to look at Dorn and then at Karn. "General, I would like to be there when you interview Wraith. If he's not still in the medical ward, I have an idea of how to get a hold of him."

This seemed to have the desired effect, As the lady doctor let her arms drop into her lap. She took her copy of the file then and slipped it into an oversized pocket of her labcoat, then picked up her scattergun. "I also have some business to finish in the medbay. I'll go with you Miss Marina.
"And Thank you." There was still an edge to Verc's voice, as she shouldn't have needed to point out common courtesy to the likes of Generals and Commanders. "My ship is actually tucked away in one of the secondary cargo holds, to get it out of the way. I'm sure it will be transferred to the main hanger, by the time we're ready to depart."

Holding open the door for the females, and anyone else who wanted to exit at the time, Bucky waited for them to head out before following them out the door. After they leave, though, Bucky heads towards the cargo bay Verc indicated as the location of her ship. He had some trunks to transfer after all. He wanted to be ready at a moment's notice.

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Yogi** (2009-12-21 21:37:07)

with the meeting over and Stone making his way to the door Karn spoke up before he left the room. **Captain Stone, feel free to requisition what you think we will need or can get your hands on. If they give you any problems do as we have done before and say that is is on my orders your asking for the equipment."**
The chatter broke out at the table with almost everyone talking at once. The one called Karid was the first to gain his attention. "It would appear your second-in-command has given himself leave, General Starfallen, and so I will direct my inquiry straight to the top of the chain, in an effort to get some manner of plan in action before things break down. What now? Shall we regroup at Doctor Adlor's ship while you check the Archives and this 'Wraith' is interviewed?"
Karn stood and looked at the other Force user. there was still something familiar about him but it still eluded his as to why. **"Yes to both questions Karid. Marina I'm guessing that you have had some dealings with Wraith before? Please find out where he is so we can ask him a few questions."** He looked back at Karid. **"And Karid from what I have heard of your request, and how that request happened, to help the republic I'm sure your role will become apparent none soon."** He smiled.
Karn looks at Verc, the doctor, and who also appears to be their transport for the mission. **"Doctor, I agree with the others that having one with your skills will be a boon to our mission. As far as your ship goes it may just have been an added bonus to having you along. A bonus that I'm happy to have."**
Karn smiled when Bucky was happy that there were several that understood him. Karn walked over to the big Wookie and patted his hand on the wookies arm in a friendly fashion. **"You can count one more in this group that understand you. Any input you have,"**  he looked to all the others **"Is welcome and expected. We all have skills and talents that we may not all share. For this mission we will need to utilize them all for it to be successful."**
Karn gave all of them his comm signal before leaving. **"Lets get to work the sooner we can be off the better."** Karn followed them all out of the briefing room. **General Numa If you have the location of Wraith lead the way. Also if anyone has a gear make sure it get to the *Void Prophet***

'Ah, so you heard about that?' Karid asked of Karn, a grin blooming on his face.
'Possibly not one of my most well-thought out moments, but at least it got my point across quickly and succinctly. And here I am, so it either worked or this is to become an elaborate punishment for my audacity.'
He slipped his fingers around the metal case at his chair's base, tightening his grip to lift it as he stood and walked to the door, where he offered his spare hand to the Jedi General.
'It will be a pleasure to work with you. I have to say, it has long been a desire of mine to stand on the same field as Jedi. Whatever the reason for this chance, I shall relish it.'
Karid looked at Bucky, also present in the doorway. Though Karid was an unusually tall human, when he offered his hand to the Wookiee he had to reach upward. He had not himself been able to understand Bucky, but had easily understood the context of his conversations from replies made.
'I apologise that I cannot be included among those making your life simpler, but my time has always been spent on physical and mental conditioning rather than in extending my knowledge. In retrospect, perhaps I have been neglecting the growth of my mind in an effort to control it. Nevertheless, I'm sure we will manage to work well together with a little effort. And perhaps from working alongside you I will begin to understand Shyrii'wook in any case?'
After shaking Bucky's large paw, Karid walked between the two of them and out into the corridor, where he turned and addressed Karn again:
'Well then, since I have no tasks to fulfil at this time, I will collect what few possessions I did not bring to the briefing and wait in the cargo bay. Perhaps I can find some free space to go through some routines. In any case, hope your researches are fruitful.'
He spins neatly on his heel, once more proving to those who notice such things that his movements are beautiful in their economy, and walks away in long strides.

"Well if you haven't gathered already, the name's Dorn. I'm a mercenary with Dalyr's Ocelots, I'l tell you now we've fought on both sides of this war but now we're officially backing the Republic." He took his helmet off and left it in his left hand, gripped tightly as he walked to exit the room. His head was scarred and showed old cuts despite looking quite young, his eyes looked weary. "The Red Giant's down in the hangar bay, I'll see you all there." He finished before placing the helmet back on his head and leaving to prepare his ship. He'd worked in teams before, but the usually had time to train together before being thrust into a possible combat situation.
As he found his way to the hangar he thought of how the ship needed to be tweaked. One of the stabiliser fins was loose and not responding properly, and a laser cannon was slightly off centre, reducing it's accuracy. The engines probably needed fine tuning again too, they were altogether slightly too big for the ship and had to be maintained fairly regularly to keep them respsonsive.

Marina nodded at Karn. "I doubt he would have remained in the medical bay for long. If you would excuse me I will attempt to track him down. Once I have located him I will contact you." Giving the senior Jedi and the others a short bow she turned back down the corridor. Going the way she had come, which she remember passed the barracks, the mess hall, and their rec rooms. To find out exactly where he would be at that particular time would require asking around. Though Wraith may still be injured, the fact he was almost one hundred percent told her he wouldn't have stuck around the med bay. Not unless they took measures to keep him there, which probably would have done more harm than good.
Her boots clicked lightly on the plated decks and for once she felt comforted by the military standard decor. Familiar surroundings after being pulled out of what turned into a hostile situation. She thanked the Force, not for the first time, that she was still alive. Finding a computer station, she entered her information to access the information she was seeking. The last recorded whereabouts of Wraith.

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Yogi** (2009-12-22 12:28:15)

Karn nodded as Marina gave her thoughts on where to find Wraith. He really needed to be in two places at once but seeing as that was impossible he change his direction.
**"General Numa. Conduct the questioning of Wraith without me. I need to head to the archives to search for information on Master Smija Docol. It will also give me the ability to gather my belongings that I will need for the mission."** He looked at the others that were also present than back to Marina as he spoke. **"You may accompany General Numa or do what you need to do in preparation for the mission. May the Force be with you."**
Karn waited for a couple of seconds for any questions then turned and headed back to ship that had brought him here. It wouldn't be a long trip back to the temple. And if all went well searching the archives for Master Smija Docol would go quickly. His long strides made his robes flow out behind him and his twin sabers sway back and forth from his quick pace.

As a Doctor, and ship owner, Verc had several things to do before she'd feel she could leave the ship. First thing she did, was get back on the comlink to tell Cue to unlock the ship, and get it moved to the hanger.
As she was doing this, she went to the medbay. She needed to catch up on her paperwork, as well as transfer her patient into the care of one of the other physicians aboard the ship, Or at least get them cleared for Light duty.
Third, She searched the computer for all the information on they're destination she could find (Knowledge Galactic Lore +13).
Finally, She commed DeeDee, her medical assistant droid, and had it check the expiration dates on the ration, medical supplies, and that sort of thing.

Upon arriving in the hangar Karid found an unobtrusive spot behind some storage crates where he wouldn't be in the way. After setting his possessions down he moved to the middle of the space and went through some of his routines, flowing through the moves slowly and repeatedly, getting faster and faster each time until he became a blur of motion. When satisfied, he continued to the next routine, and the next, typing them together into longer and more complex patterns that showed off his mastery of martial arts.
At one point he glanced toward the metal case holding his wan-shen, but decided not to open it. There were plenty of other kata he might practice other than those involving his traditional weapon.
Unless interrupted in some fashion, this engagement would keep Karid occupied until the others gathered.

The shuttle put down at the Jedi Temple, the short ride seemed like it took twice as long. Impatience was trying to get the better of him. Focusing on the here and now thay had a lot to do. Karn stepped out of the shuttle. "What are your orders Master Starfallen." the pilot asked quickly before the Jedi was out of earshot.
Looking back Karn pointed to the deck. **"Stay here till I return. I'll need transport back to the hanger from which I will be departing. I shouldn't be too long."** The pilot gave a thumbs up in understanding as Karn walked quickly away from the shuttle.
The walk to the archives wasn't a long one. He knew the way well having spent a considerable amount of time in the archives which held the vast knowledge of the Jedi for thousands of years. It was one of his favorite places in the galaxy.
As he reached the entrance to the archive his wrist comm beeped. Looking at the incoming transmission he saw that it was Captain Stone. **"Go ahead Captain."**
"General, what supplies are you looking for the crew looked well geared enough I think rations, ammo and survival gear would be about it?" Stone asked in his normal command like voice.
**"Sounds good Captain. And don't forget the fun stuff that makes the clankers go boom."** Karn said with a smile. **"General Numa will be questioning Wraith and I'm currently at the archives. I shouldn't be long. Karn out."**
Turning off the com he stepped up to the large doors and entered. Looking around for the one that would be able to help him he finally found her. Madame Jocasta Nu a former council member who now presided over the archives.
As Karn approached he saw her helping a few of the younger students. Despite being in a hurry he promptly waited his turn. When she turned around she offered Karn a smile. "Master Starfallen it had been quite some time since I last saw you within these halls. How may I help you."
Karn returned the welcoming smile. **"Yes it has been some time. The events of the last few years have kept me rather busy."** He saw the nod of her head in that she already knew the state of affairs in the galaxy. And again he felt like a young student back many years ago only then he was looking up at her instead of looking down from his current height.
**"I am looking for information on two things. First I need to find all information on Master Smija Docol. Despite what has been heard he is not dead. And I also need info on the Roon system."** He looked towards the First Hall as he spoke.
Master Nu smiled. "Master Starfallen I believe that you know how and where to find what you are looking for. If you do not find it then come and find me if you have the time to do so." Karn almost wondered how she knew he was pressed for time then thought better of it.
**"May the Force be with you."** Karn said as he turned away and headed for the Rotunda. The Rotunda was where one could access all the four main halls that the information was kept. Karn needed the First and Third halls. The first Hall kept the records and journals of over a billion Jedi since records had begun to be kept. The Third hall was filled with information on the geography and culture of each and every known planet in the Republic. If there was information on Master Smija Docol and the Roon System it would be found between the two halls.
Entering the first hall Karn sat down at a terminal and entered Smija Docol's name and waited for the information.
OOC: restating from the earlier post. I wanted to post more on the search for the information.

As Stone waited for a response from General Karn he was looking around the hanger for a ship that would be suitable for this mission.
"Sounds good Captain. And don't forget the fun stuff that makes the clankers go boom." Karn said with a smile. "General Numa will be questioning Wraith and I'm currently at the archives. I shouldn't be long. Karn out."
Stone didn't hesitate in battle he was quick on the trigger and quicker in the mind. "If I may correct the General its Commander Stone, not captain. I have secured enough explosive rounds to make many clankers into the scrap metal. Just waiting on the intel from what ship would be the best choice. I have no doubt a medical ship is good for medical purposes but on a mission where things will get hot it's not the best choice. Stone out."
Jedi always seems to confuse Stone talking about things that couldn't be seen and yet having powers that made Stone edgy. His wrist knife jumped out as he clenched his fist in a reflexacise manner. "Well at least if I run out ammo I still have this" he said to him self chuckling.

### **Vash** (2009-12-25 23:27:37)

Stone as you entered the main hanger a Hwk-290 slowly landed. The relative good condition of ship suggested that Verc tried to keep her ship away from the front lines. The ship itself is well stocked but as mentioned before it only has one gun. As you inspect the ship further you hear heavy foot steps from behind you. Al'verde walks up as he adjusts his helmet and glances at Stone "I'm sorry to have to pull you away from your troops but the higher up wanted you on this mission. They said I might let my personal feeling get in the way." As he spoke a heavily armed Firespray-31 lands beside the Void Prophet. Al'verde nods his head "Roger that Matsun I'm on may way...negative Wraith is not coming on this mission. You have any other questions before I leave?"
Karid, Dorn, and Bucky see this as well and figure that you have enough time to ask the commander any questions before he leaves.
**********************************
Karn as you pull up the archives you learn that You learn that Master Smija Docol was very different from most Jedi. He believed that he could over come an foe with shier bruit force rather than training with the force. This would allow his to focus his mind on his own power and strength, as for the Sith, he learned how to defend himself from the force and knew that if his saber skill were at their peek he could take one down without any trouble. You also learned that three weeks before his "death" he started to study droid designs. With in his notes you find drawings and side notes on how droids could be improved upon and how new ones could be made but there are no final plans.
**********************************
Verc, DeeDee informs you that all supplies still have two months before they expire. DeeDee also informs you that the Void Profit has also safely landed in the main hanger. You arrive in the medbay a and easily find another doctor to take over the care of your patient. The computer powers up and quickly pulls up information on the planet Roon. Roon is located in an impenetrable cosmic dust cloud ominously referred to as the Cloak of the Sith and surrounded by a lethal ring of asteroids and meteors. Roon only rotates on its axis once every orbit around the sun, rendering one side constantly bright and the other side constantly dark.It has a temperate climate and standard gravity making it comfortable place to live for many species. The people or Roon refuse to discard archaic technologies if those techniques still worked. The planet's proximity to Ryloth has resulted in a large Twi'lek population.
**********************************
Marina as you walk through the halls you easily find a computer and pull up the records. As you skim through you find that, despite doctors orders and advice from other medical personal, Wraith is in the training area helping out some of the "shinnies" as they were called.

Verc nods, as she transfers the information onto her datapad. And while she's at it, she also adds information about Kel Dor, Wookie, and Twi'lek biology onto her datapad, to review just in case.
Between the asteroid field, and the dust cloud, She decides that having upgraded shields is probably a good idea. Even if her Void Prophet lacks more then defensive weapons.
"General Karn, this is Doctor Adlor." she says speaking into her comlink once again. "I just accessed the ships computer on the Roon System, and what it mentions is something pretty interesting. Apparently its inside a dust cloud called the Cloak of the Sith. While your playing in the archives, perhaps you should see if you can find any more information. Regardless, I think we should find a cargo of some kind to use as cover. It says they are reluctant to upgrade technology if the older systems still work. They must be in desperate need of replacement parts for their archaic systems, perhaps we could just load the ship with the oldest junk we can find and see what happens."

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Yogi** (2009-12-26 02:49:02)

Karn looked over the information that he was able to pull form the archives. It appeared that Master Smija Docol took a different approach that the norm believing that plain brute force and physical prowess instead of using the Force was his best way of dealing with adversaries. Another interesting tidbit were the droid designs. He knew enough about the separatists droids that this could be a problem granted he didn't have the advanced droid knowledge others. He knew that Marina was very mechanically inclined. ***She might have more insight on this. Better download the information.***
Karn down loaded all the info on to his data pad as his comm vibrated. bringing up his left arm he saw that the cal was from Verc the groups medical doctor. "General Karn, this is Doctor Adlor. "
**"Karn here Doctor Adlor go ahead."** He acknowledged his comm.
"I just accessed the ships computer on the Roon System, and what it mentions is something pretty interesting. Apparently its inside a dust cloud called the Cloak of the Sith. While your playing in the archives, perhaps you should see if you can find any more information. Regardless, I think we should find a cargo of some kind to use as cover. It says they are reluctant to upgrade technology if the older systems still work. They must be in desperate need of replacement parts for their archaic systems, perhaps we could just load the ship with the oldest junk we can find and see what happens."
As she mentioned "Cloak of the Sith" he had begun inputting the information along with the planet Roon into the search parameters. As he hit the button to allow the archives vast and powerful computers to reference the query he sat back as Verc went over her analysis of the Roon system.
**"Thank you Dr. Aldor I'm searching on that info as we speak. Thank you for the information. Your following idea is a sound one Maybe some older medical equipment could supplement the other outdated systems they may be looking for. See to it that you get what you need to acquire so we can set up this cover as you suggested. If you need additional clearance to get anything Commander Stone can help you. I should be there shortly. Karn out."**
Closing down the comm link he smiled. ***So far they seen to be turning out to be fairly resourceful. That is good.*** he thought to himself as he waited for his query to come back.
OOC:
Gather information +20; favorable circumstances again I'm guessing. The time to search is halved due to the Informer feat.

As Bucky finished lugging the last of his two spacer chests into the docking bay, he unlocked both of them and rummaged through the contents to make sure his spare parts and back up gear was there. One could never be sure. After making sure that his dire vibro-blade and Bothan Force Pike (one never knows when capturing someone alive is requested), he packed everything in and relocked the first chest. The second chest mostly contained his spare bowcaster ammo and his spare rocket pack fuel cells. He'd been in a situation before where he couldn't find a retailer selling fuel cells for rocket packs. And since Bucky liked walking around as a tank, but didn't like giving up on the ability to follow his comrades wherever they went, he made sure that his rocket pack was always ready to go.
After checking the second chest and locking it tight as well, Bucky sat down on top of one of the chests and pulled his bowcaster from behind his back and checked the springs, gears, and levers again. One of his friends from the Pits had commented before that Bucky was rather obsessive about his gear. Whenever Jerin made comments like that, Bucky just shrugged and reminded him of who saved who in the Pits.
Satisfied with his bowcaster, Bucky re-slung the weapon onto his back, next to the rocket pack. Picking up his power hammer, Bucky made sure the power cells were fully charged and the gravity generator was still working.
Finally, moving on to his vibro-ax, Bucky made sure the grips were on there good and tight. Bucky had added a strap to the axe's handle to help him keep his grips on it in a fight. After all, this **was** the axe he'd ripped off of the Trandosahan in the Pits and killed with. He preferred using it with its neutronian finish when dealing with particularly nasty people.
Finally, Bucky patted his utility belt and bandoleer to make sure everything was still where it was supposed to be.
Finally satisfied, Bucky saw the Mandalorian from the briefing talking to Commander Stone. Bucky shrugged and gave the soldiers their privacy. After all, his job on this mission had been explained in its beautiful simplicity.
Look scary, kill people/ things that threatened the team.
Bucky liked simplicity. It made life easier in his opinion in the long run if the villains were easily discerned and the heroes too.
Sitting on the trunks, Bucky waited for the rest of the team to show up so they could get going.

During his exercises, Karid had some time to think. And, while not usually keen on wild speculation, one disturbing possibility had occurred to him that he felt it wise not to dismiss entirely.
Hearing Al'verde from across the hangar and recognising his distinctive tones, he decided to put voice to his thoughts. The Commander's opinion on the idea would be interesting, at least. Perhaps he could even give a definitive answer.
'I have a query, Commander,' he said, emerging from the semi-private spot where he had practised.
'I wondered whether Smija Docol might not be alone in his defection? History tells us there are usually two reasons for a Jedi to change their colours. The first is the influence of an outsider. The second method, which is the one of potential concern to me, is the growth of political division within the order leading to a schism. Such a division seems more than possible in a time of war and unrest. I don't know whether this concern has already been raised and addressed, and I don't know if there are factors that would allow it to be dismissed. All I know is that it would be lax of us to simply assume Docol is a lone case based on the facts given during the briefing. In your opinion, is it worth pursuing this line of enquiry?'

Marina heads to the training area.
You find Wraith with his right arm and mid torso bandaged as he throws another clone to the ground, gritting his teeth to keep from letting out and hint of pain
Wraith looks up as he stands "They won't clear me for duty so I figured I would help out down here."
"I see." she checks for any major injuries before turning her attention to Wraith. "walk with me lt."
Making sure wraith follows her she heads away from the training room.
You find that he has not torn any of his wounds open. Wraith salutes to the troops and starts to follow
She speaks low as they walk. "I hear you had an encounter with a Jedi."
Wraith catches up as he hears you speak "No ma'ma a fallen Jedi. The man was leading a squad of droids, but they were not normal clankers. I have never seen these droids before"
Marina nodded tersely."What was different about them?"
"Everything. I mean they walked on two legs but each one was armed two with light repeaters that replaced their forearms."
"Under what circumstances did you enounter them?"
"Combat they almost wiped out Gama Squad but Al'verde steped in and started wiping them out, that's when he showed up."
"The fallen Jedi?"
"Yes. He killed Wreckage and came after me. He didn't even use his saber on me. Instaed he tried to pull my arm out of its joint."
Marina winced. "The Jedi went after you after the commander appeared?" she asked as clarifcation
"Yeah like he was waiting for someone to challenge him. The commander landed a good shot with his rifles and he dropped me. Then I blacked out right as the commander ran up with his hamer ready."
"What oocured after the Jedi showed and the commander attacked?"
"I'm not sure what happend. You would have to ask him. I woke up in the medbay."
"Besides telekinesis what other abilities did you perceive? Combat prowess?"
"No he didn't use any powers. He only used his saber and strength. Youll want to be carefull. He may be you better in hand to hand
Marina raised an eyebrow at the statement. "I'll take it into consideration. Is there anything you wish to add to this report?"
"Yes...I think he's a Sith, one of his eyes was yellow and I could tell his other eye was fake and I felt very cold around him."
"The rest of Gama said the same thing alsot as if he was causing fear in us."
"Did you notice any other prosthesis?"
"One of his arms and one of his legs"
Marina nods. "our medical specialist believed as much from the recording."
"Speaking of doctors, you may be placed on active duty sooner if you actually allowed them to do their job. However boring such ministrations may be."
She smiles at him "though I can't blame you."
Wraith sighs "I know I'm good to go I just need to get a good nights sleep on the Spire." he smiles
"Sleep novel concept for our line of work."

</details>

Marina's meeting with Wraith had gone as expected, having gathered what intel she could from his account of what had happened. She hoped what she had learned would provide some light behind how Master Docol operated if not how to stop him.
Now heading toward the hanger bay, she made a stop to freshen up and change into some cleaner clothes. She made a note to herself to acquire new clothing and wished she had some spare time before heading out once more to retrieve some from her quarters at the temple. There wasn't much else she needed as most of her possessions and tools always traveled with her. She did however decide to pick up some fresh power packs as well as some spares.
A thought crossed her mind. If they were to capture a fallen Jedi alive, they would need some way to contain him. While two Jedi might be able to, she didn't want to leave things to chance. From her bracer computer, she did a search to see about acquiring a special piece of hardware, one even she was loathe to possess. A force cage.

Dorn arrived in the hangar bay and quickly approached his ship. The sleek lines were complimented by it's warm colour scheme and it looked somewhat like a racing craft more than a battle ready fighter, especially with the oversized main thruster. Looks can be deceiving though.
He carefully opened the cockpit and gently floated into the seat using the repulsorlift built into his armour suit. Once inside he began to run the standard pre-flight diognostics to ensure everything was in order, the flight computer hummed into life as it began the vital process. Engines, green. Life support, green. Communications, green. Weapon systems... Red. Dorn immediately leapt from his seat to inspect the laser cannons mounted on the ship, there were three in total, supplemented by a Concussion Missile Launcher.
A quick inspection revealed that the weapons needed recalibrating, they were all misaligned and their power supply seemed to be fluctuating. Dorn got to work after a few moments of scanning the area for anyone who may have dared to touch his ship, his accusing eyes were luckily hidden by his crimson toned helmet. The housing at the base of each weapon was carefully removed and wires were checked and double checked, gyros were adjusted and some parts were replaced by anything on hand. Altogether it took about 30 minutes for Dorn to be finished, which was amazingly fast considering he had to do the job three times for each cannon.

Stone acknowledges Al'verde as he approaches and listens to what he has to say. Hearing the pain and anger in his voice Stone wonders what could be keeping him from returning to settle the score.
"I'm not sure I would handle it any other way" Stone said firmly, "Those troopers were my brothers in arms and desvered better than to die at the hands of a fallen hand waver. Makes me wonder what has so many of their kind leaving our side and either joining the Sep's or just going about their own ways. A question I had was do you have any intel on those droids in the Halo image? They are different then the ones i've ever seen or encountered. Any tips on how to best them would be a great help."
As Karid came over and started his own conversation with Al'verde Stone took his leave as he had better things to do in the mean time.
Walking over to Bucky Commander Stone takes off his glove and offers his hand to the mighty wookie. "It's been a while Bucky, have you ripped off any more droid arms since we last worked together? Stone says joking while gripping the wookies forearm in the traditional mando'a greeting.

Hearing Commander Stone walk over towards him, Bucky looked up from finishing his equipment check and smiled. Granted, a Wookie's smile looked more like a predatory grimace than a friendly gesture, but any trooper who'd worked with Wookies long enough would understand the meaning. Gripping Stone's arm in his paw, Bucky shook his arm in the same way every other clone commander had. Bucky had learned long ago that the commandos and arcs, and a handful of the troopers, had taken on Mandalorian traditions. Bucky had completely understood the desire to connect with one's past. Family is family, after all. Without family and a connection to the past, no one can find their way in the present. You tend to wander around lost and alone. No way to live in Bucky's eyes.
And, since the commando greeted Bucky in the Mandalorian way, he figured that Stone must consider him some sort of family. Certainly Bucky reciprocated, so he returned the favor by pulling Stone into a Wookie hug, picking him up off the deck plating and swinging him back and forth a bit before putting the clone down and smacking him on the back, knowing full well that the commando was tough enough to handle Bucky's enthusiasm.

with little else to do, Verc packed the few things left in her quarters. Most changes of clothing and a few personal items, before heading down to the hanger herself.
She ignores the rude clone officer, as she comes up to the wookie. *Apparently they know each other. Maybe that will help in the long run.* She thought to herself. "If you boys are just standing around. Maybe you can do me a favor. I know how how you military boys like your explosives. But please make sure no one brings a large amount on board. It's going to be hard enough explaining why two jedi and a clone trooper are aboard my ship if we get boarded."

As Stone was air lifted by Bucky tossed around and then planted back on his feet his back felt a little straighter but he also felt as if Bucky had planted him down into the hanger floor.
Taking off his helmet before he speaks to the touchy docter, "Doc, your ships in fine shape for a war being present" Stone says firmly "So if you fly the way you have been being boareded wont be an issue. If your worried about what gear being brought aboard your going to have to talk with General Karn as he gave me orders to bring explosives encase we get in a rough spot. I don't think its a lot but every one has their own opinion on whats to much".
Stone does his best not to glance at the two large crates behind bucky that seem to be the wookies arsenal.

Marina lugs a large crate into the hanger bay with the aid of a repulsor lift. A large duffel and a small crate rested on top of the crate, the last of her gear she had dropped off at her quarters before the meeting. Not entirely thrilled with the device, she knew it might save their lives provided they were able to capture the rogue Jedi. Stopping as she nears Verc and Stone, she asks Verc simply as she watches Bucky carry his crates toward the freighter. "Permission to go aboard?" Verc seemed to like such formalities and it had always been Marina's opinion to stay on your medic's good side.

"Of course." Verc says to Marina, letting the other woman board the ship, before turning her attention back to the Clone and the Wookie. "A handful of Grenades, and some demolition charges are one thing. Two pallets of thermal detonators, and 5 tons of detonite are quite another. Do you understand?"
Walking into the shuttle she finds Marina once more. "I'm thinking we should stop on Belgaroth, The planet is covered in scrap yards. We should be able to find some suitable junk to satisfy the locals of the Roon System. Might even make a profit."

Marina was unloading the large crate from the repulsor lift when Verc found her. She continued to work as Verc spoke to her. "Picking up some cargo sounds like an excellent idea. We have no idea what we are facing in Roon and giving our trip some sort of credence is going to be a must." Setting the crate down and securing it in the hold, she turned to face the other woman directly. "I can help determine what scrap will be worth taking once we get there. Did you have anything in particular in mind?"

Al'verde looked at Stone "Something tell me that the Jedi are losing there grip on their own. They need someone to pull them back into line or they're all going to kill each other. As for the droids, you deal with them just like any other droid, turn it to scrap." he said before watching Stone walk off. As Kraid walked up Al'verde thought for a moment about his question "Well form the way this guy acted I doubt anyone would have turned him. I'm guessing he's following his own path and feels that the Jedi have become too weak and need a new leader to show them how to crush the Sith. That what I got from fighting him anyways. As for my *opinion*...none of you should be going on this mission and Gama Squad should be taking care of this, but I'm just a commander after all I don't get to make those kind of choices." he said with a bit of harsh tone hidden in his voice. Before any more questions could be asked he watched the landing ramp of the Firespray-31 lower and turned to the ship "This is no longer my mission rookie. You figure out what is worth following and what is going to lead to your grave." Al'verde stepped onto the ship as it slowly lifted into the ground and finely closed up before taking off out of sight.
**************************************
As the supplies are loaded onto the ship a clone commando in dark gray, almost gunmetal, armor walked up and looked around for a moment before walking closer to the Void Prophet and dropped off a box with a recorder attached to it. Then just as a cargo speeder passes by he disappears without a trace. (Anyone that approaches the box will see that is has a extremely complex mechanical and electronic lock and is addressed simply to "The General")

The region is very hard to navigate, making Roon somewhat inaccessible; only one hyperspace route is know known to reach the planet. Most consider it more than a challenge for seasoned astrogators and is known as the near-suicidal, Twi'lek-charted Death Wind Corridor connected to Ryloth.

Having been walking down the ramp of the Void Prophet to get his second crate of supplies, Bucky saw the clone trooper drop off the box and disappear. Looking around, but not finding the trooper anywhere, Bucky stomped over towards the box, but kept his distance.
Bucky didn't like people leaving surprises, and didn't trust anyone that didn't introduce themselves. Clone armor could be faked, after all, or stolen from a dead trooper's body and repainted. With his hammer inside the ship, Bucky drew out his vibro-ax and activated it. As the hum filled the entire weapon, Bucky roared over his shoulder back at the ship.

'Well done Commander,' Karid said as he watched the Firespray disappear out of the hangar, 'you have effortlessly claimed the Karid Dalhin award for "least helpful man I've ever met".
He turned sharply away and returned to his possessions, gathering them up and taking them across to and up the ramp of Doctor Adlor's freighter. Thanks to the onset of an uncharitable mood he mused privately as he did so that if the representatives of the Republic he had met so far today were anything to go by, he wasn't one hundred percent certain it was worth fighting for.
It was under the auspices of that same mood that Karid emerged again within the next few minutes, sensing some urgent meaning to the Wookiee's calls from the bottom of the ramp. He appraises the scenario and spots the box, which he approaches to check the attached recorder.
'"The General". Hrm. I hope the Jedi is expecting this. From the fact your axe is drawn, I suspect its delivery was suspicious? Telling, but perhaps not meaningful. It may just be the sort of shambles of which I'm beginning to wonder if precedes *every* Republic mission, or just ours.'
The orange-eyed man backs off and up the ramp, where he settles into a waiting position leaned against the portal frame.
'It is for Karn to decide what to do with it. It is addressed to him, and in any case he's in charge. I expect Doc will have a few strong words to say about it if he can't account for its origins, though.'

In response to the doctors bad mood on ordance Stone simply replies, "Once again that is a matter to take up with General Karn. As you can see though there is no such ordance present at this time so I see little reason for you to be a in huff about nothing" Stone says as he holds back his annoyance for this docotor who doesn't have a clue about what she was talking about.
Stone was in the process of gathering his gear when Bucky started going off about a package.
"Easy old friend" Stone tells Bucky, "Go and get General Marina as this package isn't directed at any certain general. Let her decide with her ways if it poses a treat until General Karn is present" Stone says in a gentle tone.

Marina's head turns towards the loading ramp when she hears the racket Bucky makes about the box outside the ship. "If you'd excuse me doctor." Dropping the duffel she had picked up she turns toward the boarding ramp to discover what was going on.
Her boots clicked on the metal plating as she walked down the ramp, catching Stones appeasement to Bucky. "I'm here. Bucky if something was going to happen before opening it, your ax wouldn't do much good." There's a quizzical expression playing on her face as she looks at the box. "Bucky is that it?" Slowly she approaches it as she speaks. "Did you get a look at who left it here?" Kneeling down next to the small crate, she took note of its dimensions and what it was made out of, and then took a closer look at the lock.
A small smiled formed on Marina's face as she quickly recognized whose handiwork had constructed the box. Without hesitation she applied the opening sequence and it clicked open. She wondered what sort of present Wraith had left her this time.

Karid realised that Bucky had addressed him, but of course he knew not the meaning. He did know, though, that he had already told Bucky he couldn't understand, so the Wookiee probably wouldn't be offended if he didn't reply. Silence was probably preferable to the other options, which were either a big misunderstanding or a ridiculous game of cross-species charades.
He watched Marina investigate the mysterious case, and realised she not only seemed completely at ease, but also happy about its arrival. Reasoning that it was indeed expected and he would be of little practical use standing watchdog at the top of the ramp, Karid slipped back inside and found himself a seat, where he secured the crash webbing around himself and settled into meditation until the ship's ascent was completed or he was otherwise disturbed.

Karn sat at the terminal as it searched for his query. He looked around at his surroundings. It was surprisingly quiet here in the archives to which he sighed. Only a handful padawans and several other knights were present in his area.
He sighed at the emptiness as remembered to a time back when he began his training. The archives always used to be busy with students and masters alike spent time here. It was a testament to the current times. Just about every able bodied master, knight, and padawan old enough to go out on a mission was gone. ***War, Such a terrible thing it is.*** He thought as the information he was looking for came up.
The Roon system, hard to navigate, only one way in. **"Would be a good place to intercept someone or us."** He said softly as he worked away on the terminal to save the information to his datapad. Looking at his chrono he saw that he had been here for longer than he wanted. Standing quickly he made his way towards the exit. Bidding farewell to Master Nu he exited the main doors as his cloak billowed out behind him due to his quick pace.
Arriving at his quarters Karn entered the access code. As the door opened he entered and walked to his room where he kept a bag that was always ready for missions. A quick change of clothes he was ready. He traded in his normal Jedi attire for something that didn't scream Jedi. Grabbing his bag he was out the door and walked quickly to where his transport was waiting for him.
------
Stepping down off the gang plank Karn looked around. Not knowing exactly what the *Void Prophet* looked like He caught a hold of a deck officer and found out where the ship that was to be used for their mission was berthed. With his quick stride he made his way quickly to the *Void Prophet* where he saw a few of the others outside the ship. Walking up he saw Marina outside the ship with a box of some kind that she was going over intently as Bucky and Stone stood by outside.
For those that looked at the approaching that saw the same tall, short haired, goatee wearing man but now he was dressed much differently than before. Black cargo pants, black shirt over a white undershirt. At his side down low on his leg was his blaster worn for all to see. Hidden were his lightsabers in their concealable holsters that were fitted into the large pockets of his cargo pants. Two rings were visible on the belt that he also wore. Thought they could easily be used to hang a glowrod from just as easily as a lightsaber hilt.
He came to a stop before the two imposing figures in front of him shifting the pack on his shoulder slightly. He looked at the two and then settled his gaze on Commander Stone. **"I've gotten the information from the Archives that we can all go over soon."** Karn looked at the crates that were next to the two. **"Everyone and their gear accounted for Commander Stone."** Karn addressed the Clone making sure this time to get his rank correct. **"I'd rather not get half way to Roon only to realize we forgot something. "** He said with a smile that faded as he remembered the good doctors objection to her ship being used in the mission.
He looked up to the ship that looked pretty decent as he ran his hand over his goatee. **"Is she still upset about her ship being used for the mission?"** He could understand her feelings about it. She was pretty much told she was going to use it with out asking first if it was alright.

As Karn approached Stone had a chuckle it wasnt often you see a jedi master out of his comfy robes. Seeing as the General wanted to be incognito Stone resisted the urge to snap a salute but instead nodded towards Karn.
"**Everyone and their gear accounted for Commander Stone**." Karn asked in pleasent manner. "So far everyone is accounted for with the acception of Dorn working on his star fighter. We are loading the last of the gear and it seems the Doc is having issues on how much ordance we might be bringing. As i've informed her we bring what we must and we have no where near what she thinks were going to bring" Stone said with slight irratation as he meantioned the Doc.
"Is she still upset about her ship being used for the mission?" Karn asked as if he knew the answer before hand without being a jedi. "She still has something up her shebs about the whole thing, to be honest a few of the crew do. I still reccommend finding a ship thats better suited for a fight in space not one thats meant for medical purposes. I suppose if were to fly in undected its a better choice but the lack of fire power has me worried if we get into some osik" Stone said as he made a sweep of the hanger bay and helped Bucky load the last of the supplies.
Turning to General Karn before he went up the platform, "Sir there was a reason this group was assembled...I just have yet to figure out if it'll run as smoothly as someone thinks on paper" Stone said in his firm tone.

Karn noticed the smile from stone as he walked up. The Jedi couldn't blame the Commander as he was certainly out of his usual dress code. Yet he felt that this mission required a certain ammount of subterfuge that other missions he had taken on didn't require.
Stone answered his questions straight forward and to the point like normal which was one of the things he liked about the clone. Ask a question, get an honest answer even if it's one you don't want to hear. He had to admit though from the initial meeting Karn wasn;t surprised that Verc was hesitant about the gear they were bringing with them. It wasn't a lot but hopefully enough to get the job done if needed.
**"I'll talk with the Doctor and assure her that we are only taking what's deemed needed and even that isn't too much for most people, remember she pmay not a seasoned combatant but one never knows. And as far as her ship goes…"** Karn looks over the hanger bay. **"Take a look around, The pickings are slim for what we need. If there was somethign better it would have given it to us."** He siad as he let his pack slip off shis shoulder and go to the floor.
Stone had another question for him as turned for the ship. "Sir there was a reason this group was assembled...I just have yet to figure out if it'll run as smoothly as someone thinks on paper" His tone was firm as always.
Karn nodded. **"Commander I learned long ago to trust in the Force. It can have an odd way of working on things. what I can tell you is that we're all assembled here for one reason or another."**
-----
As Stone accended the boarding ramp (I'm guessing he is if not I can change it.) Karn turned to Bucky and looked up at the large wookie. **"Bucky I haven't had the chance to work with you but I have heard reports from Commander Stone and others of his unit. They all say you are an asset to have on a team and I couldn't think of anyone else better to have around to look imposing to make others think twice about starting anything."** Karn held out his hand to the wookie warrior. **"Lets get that gear on board and secured."** He said as he hoisted his bag back to his shoulder.
Karn moved toward the ship to board stepping on the gang plank and shouted up. **"Permission to come abaord Captain Verc?"**

"Of course." Verc replied over the ships PA system. The lady doctor was already running the pre-flight system's check and warming up the sub-light engines. "As I told the other one, I think we're going to have a lay-over on Belgaroth to pick up a suitable cargo. From there we can move on to the Roon system. "

Bucky waited after his comment a few seconds before he realized that Karid wasn't going to answer him.
*Hmmm. He must not understand Shyriiwook. I'll have to remember which ones can understand me and who can't. It might matter.*
Nodding and trying to smile in a non-threatening way at the yellow-eyed human, Bucky stooped down and began to lug the other crates on board and store them out of the way. Bucky knew he was carrying a bit of extra gear, so he wanted to make sure that it was not underfoot. The human doctor seemed a bit touchy as it was and Bucky didn't want to make matters worse.
As he set one of the last crates down, Bucky realized that Karn, the jedi in charge of the whole thing, was talking to him. As Karn complimented Bucky and extended his hand, Bucky extended his own paw, engulfing the jedi in his massive paw. His comments were interrupted before he could speak by Verc's comment over the PA system. Looking up towards the speaker a few centimeters above his head, he nodded his agreement with Verc's plans for a cover story.
Once that was done, he turned back towards Karn and woofed and barked.
**"rooohu wwanraaoaoworc scwo, scracaoworc orrarcwh, rhhuao rooohu waoowh'ao whwowowa aooo. ah'sc shhucao rranrawa aooo rhwo ooww cworchoahoawo. aoacwo aorcrawawo wwwowaworcraaoahoowh chuakakoorcaoc canrahoworcro, rawhwa cahwhoawo aoacwo oaoowhwwwowaworcraoaro raoaoawoakaowowa aoacwoahrc scwoscrhworccacahak, aoacworo schucao chuakakoorcao ahao rac ohwoanan."**

**"You flatter me, Master Karn, but you don't need to. I'm just glad to be of service. The Trade Federation supports slavery, and since the Confederacy accepted their membership, they must support it as well."**

</details>

Bucky stopped woofing and barking after a second and realized that he needed to check on something first. He began woofing and hooting again, this time with a questioning tone, at least the Wookie version of that.
**"waoo rooohu huwhwaworccaorawhwa cacrorcahahohooooor? whooao wohoworcrooowhwo waoowoc rawhwa ahao scraro anworawa aooo cooscwo oaoowhwwhucahoowh."**

Karn listened to Bucky after getting permission to board the *Void Prophet*. The big Wookie took his offered hand and spoke about his reasons for joining. It was a reason that Karn could understand given his early years. He nodded in agreement with the Wookie.
Bucky stopped and change his tone to a questioning one. Karn smiled and nodded. **Yes I do understand Shyriiwook. My master made sure that I learned it. From some of his stories he knew a Wookie that he considered a good friend."**
Karn moved to ascend the boarding ramp. **"Probably best that we get aboard and get this mission off the ground."** Karn walked up the ramp and found a suitable place to stow his gear.
Approaching the cockpit Karn found Verc working away on the pre-flight. **"Captain Verc,"** Karn called her Captain keeping an age old tradition of ship owners being the captain of their ship. **"again, good idea about the cover story. Belgaroth should suit our need well. I have some info that I recovered at the Jedi Archives about our target and the Roon system. We'll be having a meeting on the way to Belgaroth to go over what information the team has been able to dig up. Also, Commander Stone made it known to me about your concern of the ordinance that we will be taking. In hopes of settling you concerns my request of the Commander was to take what was needed, not an overkill. I know that you don't know Stone but he's a pretty practical person."** He shifted his weight and rested his hand on the arch way of the cockpit as he spoke.

Marina glanced through the contents of the box and once realizing what was inside, promptly stood up, taking the crate with her. She should have known that whatever Wraith would leave wouldn't be pleasant and though she had only glimpsed at the flimsiplast, the only contents of the case, she knew whatever was remaining to be read were for her eyes only. "Excuse me," she said as she headed into the ship. Once in the cargo hold, she went to her bag and set down the crate taking the recorder from the top and the flimsiplast sheet from within. The box she left, it not being important now that the contents had been removed. Picking up her gear she headed deeper into the ship to see about some quarters, or at least a quiet location where she wouldn't be disturbed as she looked over the "gift" from Wraith.
Feeling more than hearing the hum of the engines start their preflight, Marina emerged from her isolation. The recorder and note secured in a pouch. She had been correct to believe that the contents were not good new and she knew she would have to share her information with Karn. At least what she could. Finding a seat next to Karid, she pulled the crash webbing over herself. Later she knew, she would offer her services as a mechanic to Verc, but for now she needed to think. *I can think later*, she decided, activating the screen and keyboard of her bracer computer, angling it slightly so she could see it without revealing what she was typing.
With quick practiced strokes she typed it and then keying int he addressee she hoped it went through.

As Marina boareded the ship and it looked as Dorn was taking his own ship Stone flicked the landing ramp switch and then commed Verc.
"Stone to Doc, All aboard thats coming aboard. The ramp is secure as well as the cargo we are ready for take off. Over" Stone's voice was in his usually firm fashion talking to this intercom as if it was a daily routine.

Stepping into the passenger cabin with everyone else, Bucky strapped his massive frame into one of the chairs, which he barely fit into. After the webbing was securely in place, he looked over at everyone else who was on board and realized that the Kel Dor wasn't around.
*He must be flying that fighter I saw earlier.*
Seeing Marina typing something away on her personal keyboard, Bucky decided to just remain quiet for the moment till he thought of something. Looking up at Marina, he hooted to get her attention.

Marina looked up at Bucky thoughtfully as she sent the message. "No I suspect no one has." Hitting another button on her bracer she patched into Karn's comm frequently. "General, Dorn has not joined us so I suspect he is taking his own personal craft. It may be wise to send him the jump coordinates to Belgaroth." Keeping the comm open for a reply she looked back over at Bucky and smiled. "It would have been rather awkward if he had arrived at Roon without us. Well done." As she waited she unclipped her saber from her belt and placed it in a specially created pocket sewn into her jacket.

Karns comm vibrated and he looked at his wrist and hit the accept button. Marina's voice came over the speaker. He nodded as she spoke even though she couldn't see him. **"Understood General, I'm upfront with Captain Vera at the moment. I'll get the coordinates form her and relay them on to Dorn. Thanks."**
He closed the communication between them and looked at Verc as he brought up the comm freq of Dorn's fighter. **"Mr. Dorn, we'll be sending the coordinates to our first stop shortly. Karn out."**
When he received the coordinates from Verc, Karn sent them out to the last member of the team that was in his own fighter.
OOC: Seeing that Dorn doesn't have a personal comlink of any kind I'm assuming that he gave the freq of his fighter. If not someone will have to deliver it personally.

"It's Mr. Sol, Dorn Sol. Tell the pilot to fly casual, we can make this alot easier if this Traitor doesn't know we're coming. Though maybe he does with that force magic your guys like to use so much.." Dorn closed the channel and ran a finmal diagnostic check on the ship, this time everything seemed to be in order. The engines came alive with the flick of a switch and Dorn prepared the navicomputer to receive the co-ordinates for their destination. A few moments later and the system was prepared, Dorn thought whether he should indeed get an astromech to deal with the pre-flight trivialties, maybe after the next payday came through.
He had gleamed little about the planet from the files, though from experience he never felt he could trust intel entirely. Not since he and a squadron of mercs were trapped on a dustball in the outer rim after being fed month old information. Instead of facing a ragtag band of pirates they met the full might of a Confederate fleet, that's how Dorn lost his first ship and he had no intentions of losing the Red Giant.

"Actually, General. If Mr Dorn wants, he can dock with the *Void Prophet* after we leave the ship, and travel with the rest of us." Verc replies, as she maneuvers the space transport out of the docking bay.
Switching over to communications, Verc sends a message to the fighter. "Mr Dorn, we'll be stopping first at Belgaroth to take on cargo for a cover. I have an advanced docking clamp, so if you'd like you can dock with the *Void Prophet* and ride inside with the rest of us."

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Yogi** (2010-01-01 17:58:53)

Karn nodded at Verc's suggestion.
**"An even better suggestion Captain."**  He responded just before she comm Dorn. He even smiled a bit when she addressed him as 'Mr.Dorn' as he did earlier and was aptly corrected.
Sensing that the others were back in the travel area Karn posed a question to Verc.
**"Seeing as how the others are strapping in for launch do you need a hand up here? I'm not much of a pilot but I can operate sensors if needed."**

The cockpit of the Red Giant snapped shut as Dorn gently powered up the engines, nudging the fighter into a hovering position before slowly exiting the Hangar bay. "I'll dock once we're ready to jump into hyperspace, no sense in me wasting my own fuel on a jump." Dorn's hands tightly gripped the Red Giant's control joystick as he followed the Void Prophet towards a hyperspace jump point, "It's Dorn Sol, Mr Sol.. Not Mr Dorn.."

Karid sensed someone sitting beside him and smiled an acknowledgement, though he chose not to open his eyes. This had always been the worst part of a journey for him, as he was so physically inclined. He could and did often do nothing for long stretches at a time, but always by his own choice. There was something about being wrapped up in the harness so that he had no option which stirred unease within him. Karid longed for the moment he would be able to unbuckle, stretch, and do something active.
The Matukai became aware that his hands were clenching and unclenching on the arms of his seat and willed them to be still. He hoped whoever was beside him hadn't noticed the lapse in his meditation, or at least hadn't been bothered by it.

Verc motioned to the co-pilots seat, when the Jedi asked if there was anything he could do to help. There really wasn't much for him to do until well... Latter.
"Roger that, Mr Dorn." Verc replies with a shy smile. She then started maneuvering the ship out of the hanger bay. Then plotted a course for the Belgarath system.

Marina glanced over at Karid, noticing the reflexive gestures of his unease as he clenched and unclenched the armrest. At first she didn't say anything, noticing the basic signs of a one meditating, finally though her curiosity and concern got the better of her. "**Are you alright?**" Having switched off her bracer computer, she was now left to waiting as well. Left to mull over the contents of the package she had received and wondering when exactly she should disclose it to Karn and how much. *All of it*, she decided. *At least the information, he doesn't need to know who sent it.*
Marina's attention was caught by Stone as he went about his business securing the ship. A frown was creasing her forehead as she considered him. *'Keep an eye on your clone commander Stone. Don't trust him.' Some warning… but why?* Having worked with clones off and on for the last few years, she had seen no reason not to trust them. They followed orders, though some didn't follow them blindly, which she had always encouraged. She hadn't been trained to lead men into battle, if her commanders had seen an error in her judgement she would rather have been told and then given advice. Why the warning? Something to do with the Senate?

Karid opened his yellow eyes, turning them toward Marina while wearing a look of apology.
'Forgive me,' he said, obviously sorry to have rudely interrupted her own thoughts, 'I somehow always feel troubled when buckled in like this. Even when I meditate normally, the option to move as I want is always there, but now - well, now it isn't. I find the forced removal of that basic freedom frustrating.'
He smiled, but the expression was tarnished by melancholy.
'When I'm in motion, my centre and my path are both so easy to discern. It feels beautiful, perfect, and right. I can sense them when stilled, but it is not so easy. Perhaps that's why my life has been the one I have had.'

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Alicia** (2010-01-02 14:10:31)

With a nod, Marina acknowledged Karid's sentiments. "Often I don't like sitting still. For too long I've been moving, always doing something. It's often hard for me to sit still and to ignore my restlessness after long periods of it. I always find it a welcome release when I finally find my peaceful center once more." She settled back into the seat, a list of things she needed to do came popping into her mind, but she pushed them away in attempt to find some peace. There would be time enough to take care of them once they had taken off, which she knew to be soon as she could feel the engines reach their full potential for take off. She knew she was reaching the point where her exhaustion would cause her to make mistakes. Mistakes was something which got others killed in her line of work.

Karn slid into the co-pilots seat only after Verc had given him the ok to do so. Immediately he set about helping on plotting the course Belgarath system as she responded to Dorn. Again she tagged him, like he did, 'Mr. Dorn'. Looking up at her he saw the slight smile grow across her face to which Karn chuckled.
**"A doctor with a sense of humor. Somehow I'm getting the feeling that 'Mr. Dorn' will be wishing that he stayed in his fighter for the trip and that's just a gut feeling not the Force telling me that."** He finished with a small smile of his own as his fingers worked the computer.

As the Void Profit slowly lifted off the hanger floor and maneuvered out of the hanger anyone in the cockpit would see a freighter of unknown design drop out of light speed and maneuver into the hanger before landing. It has a long cylindrical fuselage with a turret right above the cockpit. Further back there are a pair of guns that rotate perpendicular to the fuselage. The sub-light engines and housed on a pair of large wings that make the freighter just as maneuverable planet side as it is in space. On top of the wings are a pair of concussion missile launchers and proton torpedo launchers. At the very back of the freighter there is another turret armed with two quad-blasters of some sort.
The Admiral of the base opens up a comm channel just before the Profit makes the jump to lightspeed "May the force be with you and may you return home in one piece."

"Begining the docking sequence," announced Dorn over the intercom to no-one in particular. After a positive response he lined the Red Giant up with the larger ship and carefully edged it into position above the docking clamps. He held her in position as the docks clamped around the ship and secured the cockpit to an airlock. Leaving the ship's coontrols securely locked and satisfied it wouldn't fall off as soon as they made the jump to lightspeed, the mercenary headed to the ship's cockpit. His armoured boots rung out as the collided with the ship's floor, loudly announcing his approach to the front of the ship. He stood in the doorway and looked down, "Looks like we're ready to jump to hyperspace."

Marina wasn't sure exactly when she fell asleep. Some point between when she had spoken to Karid and closing her eyes to find some calm, the thrum of the engines as they took off only worked to soothe her into a deep sleep. Her head ducked against her chest and she was no longer aware of what was going around her, her exhaustion being so great.

Feeling the slight surge in the ship that indicated the shift into hyperspace, Bucky undid the straps of his crash webbing and stood up, stretching his massive frame after being confined to that small space that normal beings would have probably felt comfortable.
As he stretched his muscles, he noticed that Karid was still flexing his own muscles. He was about to mention that Karid could move if he wanted to, but then he remembered that the yellow eyed human didn't speak or understand Shyriiwook. So instead, he motioned with his paws that the fellow could undo his harness and hoped that he'd understand.
He was getting ready to hoot in Marina's direction when he noticed that she'd fallen asleep. Deciding against waking her up, Bucky tried his best to sneak quietly towards the cockpit.
(Stealth +5)
However, try as he might, his massive frame most likely made some considerable noise as the 2.4 meter tall and 166 kg heavy (7.8 ft and 365 lbs) Wookie tried to tip toe past the sleeping Jedi.

"Your clear to dock." Verc replies and watches on the monitor as the starfighter smoothly docks with her ship. With a skilled eye she looks over the displays on the ship, and nods with satisfaction that everything was green. Reaching down she takes hold of the lever, and slowly pulls it down *engaging the Hyperdrive.*
Verc took a deep breath, and engaged the autopilot, She leaned back in the pilots chair, adn put her hands behind her head. "Well Nothing to do know except to sit back and relax until we get to Belgaroth."

Stone did as any clone would after a light speed jump had been made. Checked to make sure the ordanence was secured still and then made his way to the mess hall. Or in this case stoond up from the crate he was sitting on and went exploring for what the Doc would pass off as a mess hall on this craft.

Karid nodded his thanks to Bucky, a gesture accompanied by a restrained smile. He could already tell communicating with the Wookiee would be difficult, but he hoped they would get on all right despite that. He also hoped their inability to talk without a middleman would cause no problems on the mission itself.
He released himself from his restraints, taking his time so as to have less chance of disturbing Marina. The poor girl was clearly in need of a long rest, though it was perhaps a shame that time would be lost on getting to know one of the team members. Particularly one who might be a kindred spirit, if their brief conversation were anything to go by. It very well might not be, of course.
Standing, Karid followed Bucky toward the cockpit. Karn was not present here, so it followed that he was likely there. And it was Karn who was in charge, so he might just as well see if the Jedi wanted anything done - *proper introductions, perhaps?*, he contemplated - before Karid settled down to his own devices.
'Anything you need of me, Master Jedi?' he asked from the doorway.

Dorn had arrived at the cockpit just before the stars elongated as Verc activated the hyperdrive that sent to ship to lightspeed. As she did that he went over what the Admiral has said just before they jumped. *May the force be with you and may you return home in one piece.*
***Interesting choice of words from the Admiral.***
"Well Nothing to do know except to sit back and relax until we get to Belgaroth." The Doc's words brought him out from his thought. Looking at the woman he nodded.
**"Yes it appears that we will have some time in transit. Which will benefit us some as it will allow us to go over the information that I found out before we left. General Numa was going to question Wraith, hopefully she was able to find him."** Karn looks at the trip chronometer remembers the time it will take to arrive.
It didn't take long for the others to arrive after making the jump. In a matter of moments Dorn along with Bucky and Karid were at the cockpit.
"Anything you need of me, Master Jedi?" Karn looked back at the tattooed face of Karid.
Karn shook his head. **"Not at the moment my young friend but perhaps in a few moments we can all gather back in the common area and go over the intel that was gathered and our plans for when we arrive at Belgaroth and more importantly Roon. I have a feeling that this is not going to be a straight forward mission. It never is in dealing with a fallen Jedi."** As he finished Karn stood up and waited for any more questions that may be asked and for the gathering to file back down to the common area.

Karid nodded, the single motion intended to convey both assent to the gathering and agreement with Karn's following statement.
'Yes, a Jedi gone wrong will not be an easy opponent. All that combined power, skill, and cunning in the hands of someone with no qualms about *using it*.'
He turned and headed back to wait for the meeting, though before he was out of earshot the tall martial artist was heard to mutter:
'The very thought of it makes me sick.'

Karn watched as the Karid walked away and heard his mumble which he was sure that was intended to be heard. "The very thought of it makes me sick."
Karn made no attempt to stop the young man as the words resonated within him as well. ***You aren't the only one who shares those feelings Karid. I just hope that we can make him come back into the light.***
He looked at the other three that were still there. Dorn, Verc and Bucky and addressed all three.
**"Captain if all checks out up here I'd like to start the meeting on what we know and need to do before arriving at Belgaroth and more importantly Roon."** He looked at his chrono and back at the others. **"Ten minutes."** He moved past the wall of fur and the Kel Dor and back along the passage way to the common room. Spying an open seat sat next to Marina. He made sure not to disturb her as she had a few more minutes till she needed to be rousted from her cat nap. Stone was the only one who didn;t know about the meeting but Karn was sure that he would spot them gathering in the common area of the small ship.
When it was a few minutes from the meeting time Karn woke the other Jedi. **"Marina, time to wake up. The meeting will start soon."**
He waited for her to wake up and the others to arrive. When all had gathered he stood and faced them all. ***So different we all are. Yet we're all here for basically the same reasons.*** He looked at Dorn. ***Well maybe not all of us. Time will tell.*** He thought.
Standing before them he looked different in the change of clothes he was wearing. Truth be told he actually like not standing out as a Jedi once in a while. Not that he would ever confirm that to anyone.

Marina jumped as Karn roused her, her hand immediately going to her blaster at her hip as a reflex. Blinking it didn't take her long to realize where she was and her hand moved toward the arm rest instead. "Oh... Master Karn." she said, the hint of sleep invading her voice. With sure movements she began removing the restraints. "There's something I need to share with you... In private if you would please," she said, glancing around the common room at the gathering people.
Now wide awake, she stood and waited for some confirmation Karn would meet with her before she would head toward the crew quarters to share the news she had.

As Stone whipped up some grub from the mess hall or what was taken for a mess hall in this ship he found himself wondering what Kal and the Nulls were up too. How were they doing on their quest for the Awai-bait sceintist. Before he knew it the military gruel (gulosh) has he so dubbed it was done. He grabbed up what would pass as plates and utienels and headed to the common area of the ship.
Stone looked around and thought it odd that everyone was waiting for food let alone his cooking. But he was grateful they were willing to try it...or that they were very hungry and didnt care what it was as long as it smelled good.
"Mixed a little of this and that into a pot and hoped for the best. Wound up with a nice military grub if you all are hungry...if not more for me" Stone said has he sat down and started passing out his military grub. With his helment still on the heat tried to block his view. Lucky for Stone his armor was more then the average persons. He handed out a dish to Doc, and then Marina. Followed by the rest. After everyone had been servered Stone stood against the wall with his helping and enhailed the food in the way that only a soldier on a battlefront would. By taking small bits while looking around.

Karn raised an eyebrow at Marina's request. Odd to be sure but not too out of the ordinary considering the mission. With a nod he stood and faced the Jedi Knight. ***I wonder if that has to do with her conversation with Wraith?*** He thought.
**"Alright, lead the way."** He said as he held out a hand directed aft. He followed Marina to where she lead him which was back to the crew quarters.
When they stopped he looked at her. **"You understand that this will cause them to ask questions of us? Questions that we may not want to answer depending on what you have to tell me. Not that I want to keep anything from the others that are here as it wouldn't be the best way to foster trust among those we don't know well."** He looked into her eyes. **"What is it that you have for me to hear?"** Karn waited for her reply.

### **Alicia** (2010-01-05 22:44:35)

Marina nodded before, apprehensively she withdrew the holorecording from the inside pocket of her jacket she had placed it in along with the letter. "Wraith left me more than what was officially on the record and possibly more than what we were supposed to know. That's why he left it the way he did. Bucky was lucky to have seen him at all. And well... I'll let you make of what you want from the recording." Setting it on a nearby table she allowed it to play and watched it in stunned silence for what seemed like a millionth time, having had watched it over and over again before.
After a moment she reached over and turned it off, leaving it on the table. After this she didn't want anything to do with it. "Wraith had been knocked unconscious when Smija Docol attacked him and Verdy'c arrived. He had installed a holo recorder into it for recon missions and during the battle it was inadvertently activated." Next she pulled out the piece of flimsiplast, the letter she had recieved that she decided she was going to share with the more experienced Jedi.
"That wasn't all that was in there... Though it was more a warning to me, but I felt you should know about it. I won't tell you who its from other than I trust to source with my life. It reads:
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I have discovered so news that you find rather disturbing. There are rumors going around that the Jedi are losing their connection with the force, or rather their ability to read it. There are also rumors that the Jedi are getting ready to attack t the senate to regain power once General Grievous has been found and dealt with. Some of the senators are already talking about leaving the republic if they do so. Everything is very unstable right now and I know that your mission will keep you away for a long time. I fear that if things continue it will be all out civil war by the time you return.
Also, keep and eye on your clone commander. There are certain orders he may execute which will jeopardize your life.

</details>

With the letter read, she folded it calmly, relieved to get it out in the open, and placed it back in an inside pocket.

Verc checked the heading, and several other systems to insure that it was safe to leave the cockpit, before following the Jedi into the central lounge.
"Marina, dear, there are plenty of Cabins in you'd like to make use of one in the future." Verc said once the sleeping jedi was woken up, And was about to give her a scathing lecture on how sleeping in chairs could ruin ones posture, when the Stone came in from the mess hall. She sighed in frustration at the smell of the dish he'd just made.
"Commander Stone, Would you please leave food preparation to the Auto-chef in the future. And PLEASE tell me you didn't season that slop with my bottle of Corellian brandy?"

Stone didn't flinch at the Doc's remark.
"Some time after being on the battle front I started liking to have a cooked meal by hands more then machine. If you would like your rabbit pellets be my quest as I said more for me if you dont wish to eat. And theres Brandy on this vessel" Stone asked as his interest perked while the jedi went off on their secrets.

"Yes, there is. And your not getting a drop of it! And If I find out you left a mess behind, I'm not sharing any Warra nuts or Sweetcakes with you either!" Verc exclaims. She knew better then anyone that clones at as much as a wookie, to help fuel their accelerated aging. But she was having issues with the way the clone trooper simply decided to take over everything. This was HER ship, and he was eating HER food. And if he didn't start to met a least a minimum of what the noble woman believed was proper behavior, she'd have him locked in a cabin for the entire trip.

Stone was bewildered by this woman. He wasn't going to kiss her shebs if thats what she wanted but he at least thought cooking a nice meal would settle any differences they might have after that rough introduction. Guessing he didn't understand women after all Stone had a sudden loss of apatite...but then after a second thought it came back.
"Of course I cleaned what I used. You know for someone who just had a mealed cooked for her you sure are stuck on yourself. And so you don't get all high and mighty I used your cooking pot the rest was with the gear brought aboard. Now if you'll excuse me I have a nice meal to finish" Stone said firmly as he started to eat again as if nothing had happened with the uptight Doctor.

Karn listened to Marina talk about Wraith. "Wraith left me more than what was officially on the record and possibly more than what we were supposed to know. That's why he left it the way he did. Bucky was lucky to have seen him at all. And well... I'll let you make of what you want from the recording."
He watched her place the holorecording from an inside pocket and set it down on the table. He also saw that she was holding a letter that she took from the same pocket. ***Hmmm, more than just a recording. Interesting.*** Hitting the activation button she brought the recording to life. He watched the vid in silence. Looking at Marina he could she that she was still stunned by what she was seeing. Even though, Karn assumed, it wasn't the first time for her.
He had to admit though. What he saw surprised him also and he never really liked surprises.
When finished she shut it doen but left it out. She had more to tell him as she opened the letter and read form it. As she did so he raised his left hand to his middle and rested the elbow from his right arm against it as his hand went to his goatee. Silence hung in the air as she finished and put the letter away. Karn sensed that a calmness had retaken Marina. What she had been holding in secret seemed to have bothered her somewhat.
**"Interesting, both of them The recording, I think, the others should see. The letter…"** He removed his hand from his face and motioned to the letter that was now again tucked away. **"…not so much. At least for now. Although this mention of the Council planing an attack on the senate is absurd."** He paused in thought as his hand went back to his goatee.

Dorn's ears almost visibly perked up as he heard the mention of correlien brandy, he preferred a locally brewed concoction from Dorin but that was nigh impossible to find in the wider galaxy. "Brandy you say? I haven't had a drink in hours.. hehe" He looked around the room again, idly checking for where such an item would be but instead noticed that the two Jedi had left the room. "Where have they gone?" he asked to no-one in particular, loud enough for them to hear but not for anyone in a different room to. He'd casually dismissed the food offered by the clone commander, he had a military career sure, but before that he enjoyed the food his wife had cooked, since then he only cooked for himself. He'd tell others it was because he didn't want anyone poisoning him.

As Karn walked into the common area, Bucky lumbered after him and stood around the room with everyone else, letting the jedi wake the other jedi.
*Probably safer that way.*
As the two jedi left, Bucky saw Stone walk in with the pot of food, its aromas wafting towards him, making his stomach rumble with hunger. After the clone dished some food out, Bucky woofed his thanks and began digging in. He'd seen Stone eat, and knew it might be a bit of a competition as to who got more of food.
As Bucky dug in, though, he heard Verc's scathing remarks and stopped his eating with spoon in mid-air. Looking from the doctor to the clone, Bucky shrugged and decided that the fighting was up to them, and continued to wolf down the plate.
The mention of brandy didn't do much for Bucky, as he didn't drink. He'd seen fighters in the Pits who'd gotten their hands on a drink or two. They usually died later in the fights from lack of control and perception. So, Bucky'd simply decided to never drink.

Karid thanked Stone for the meal and began spooning it to his lips, reasoning that he'd have to eat sometime in any case. He listened to the continuing conflict of the Commander and the Doctor, but didn't intervene. Like Bucky, he thought that his interfering probably wouldn't help matters. At least he knew he was more or less safe from reprisals eating the food: it was prepared now, and would otherwise spoil.
As he ate, Karid thought about what matters could be important enough for the Jedi to confer in private. About what were they leaving the rest of the group out of the loop? His eyes narrowed.
*Nothing good for the rest of us, almost certainly,* he thought, *or perhaps nothing related to the task at hand. I certainly hope the charitable answer is the right one.*

Nodding her agreement Marina added, "It may be rumors of Docol's intent has reached them, such threats would make any Senator worried. Word of any Jedi wanting to take control may cause such a reaction. Even in these times a Jedi turning against the Council in such a way is rare." With a shrug, she folded her arms across her chest. Having shared the information a weight had been removed. "The others deserve to know what's on the recording, especially since it would now seem Docol will be expecting someone."
Reaching toward the table she recovered the holorecording, though not bothering to put it back into the inside pocket of her jacket. She knew Karn had intended to have started a meeting by now, but she would bet the information she had revealed may have changed some things. Waiting for KArn to leave first, she would follow him back to the common room.

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Yogi** (2010-01-06 12:04:01)

Karn nodded as Marina finished speaking and picked up the recorder. **"Valid points you raise. All the senate would need to hear is that one Jedi is looking to over throw the government that has stood for thousands of years and they would get nervous. I imagine, even with Master Yoda reassuring that no such action would ever be taken by the Council, that now the seed is planted it will continue to grow no matter what we said on the matter."** He paused for a second.
**"The last part of the recording is what troubles me. Docol specifically asked for Al'verde to go to the Roon system. As Docol said, 'Send anyone else and they die.' It's troublesome that the Commander didn't give us this recording on his own accord."**
He looked to the door and began walking. **"Marina, thank you for showing me this. It has answered some questions that I had but it brings up a plethora of others that go unanswered. One more thing."** He said as he reached the door but kept it closed. **"I respect that you want to keep the identity of the person who gave you the flimplast but there may come a time when the safety of the mission and that of your informer will be an issue. For now though, it is not that time."** He said with a thankful smile. As he waited a moment for any response from the Knight.
**"Lets go show this to the others."**
He opened the door for Marina and followed her out.
OOC: Alicia I left a moment there for you to respond to anything before they leave the room to join the others.

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Alicia** (2010-01-06 16:43:06)

Marina followed the Jedi master to the door and stopped as he raised his point concerning her contact. "When and if the need arises for my contact's identity to be revealed I will. Until that time.. Thank you for respecting my wishes." There was more than just Arek's father to protect. She knew he had taken a risk contacting her like he had, one of the reasons he had gone through Wraith rather than the usual channels. She wondered if she would ever need to reveal the rest of the message, sent specifically for her, urging her to go into hiding and waiting for the issues back home to be resolved or to be contacted by one of her closest friends. They should know by now she wasn't one to sit by and not do anything.
Karn opened the door urging her through first. As she passed the door threshold she took a breath and released it, the action releasing the rest of her nerves. The holo recorder was still in her hand. She saw no point in putting it away now, Karn would want to show it to the others. Joining the others, she resumed her seat looking between the others as they seemed to be uncomfortably eating some sort of stew. "What is it" she asked, taking a whiff trying to discern what it was. The tension was evident between Verc and Stone and she wondered what they were butting heads about now.

Bucky looked up as the Jedi entered the room again and sat down. He was just as curious as anybody else, but figured that he'd get more answers by waiting for them to talk than pressuring them to do so. Besides, they still had some time left till they arrived at Belgorath.
As Marina sat down at the table and apprehensively sniffed at the food, asking about it's contents, Bucky leaned back and let rip a Wookie belch loud enough to echo off of the walls of the ship's dining room.
Looking over at Stone, Bucky woofed and hooted.
**"scro oaooscakanahscwowhaoc aooo aoacwo oaacwoww. ah'wa wwoorcrrooaoaowowh acoooh rroooowa rooohu ohworcwo raao scraorahwhrr ra wwahwoanwa waahwhwhworc. ohraro rhwoaoaoworc aoacrawh aoacoocwo anahaoaoanwo oahurhwo aoacahwhrrc ohwo raanohraroc oararcrcro ahwh oohurc rhwoanaoc, woac?"**

**"My compliments to the chef. I'd forgotten how good you were at making a field dinner. Way better than those little cube things we always carry in our belts, eh?"**

**"rrwowhworcraan, rooohu cacoohuanwa orwhoooh rhwoaoaoworc aoacrawh aooo racor ra scrawhwaoo ohacraao'c ahwh acahc caowooh. ahao'c rhwoaoaoworc aooo shhucao woraao rawhwa whooao ohoowhwaworc chuoaac aoacahwhrrc."**

**"General, you should know better than to ask a Mando what's in his stew. It's better to just eat and not wonder such things."**

Sitting back and digging into the second bowl full of Stone's delicious stew, Bucky ate while waiting for the meeting to start. At least there was food.

Karid paused with eating utensil part way to his lips.
'Not entirely sure,' he confessed, 'but its edible. Though it remains to be seen whether its digestible.'
'In any case', he added with a smile, 'I'm grateful for the meal. My thanks to both the chef and our host.'

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Yogi** (2010-01-06 22:29:19)

Karn followed Marina out into the common room. There seemed to be some tension along with the smell of something that he couldn't quite place. Small talk pointed to Stone making some sort of stew. Like before the tension was between Stone and Verc.
The Jedi Master remained standing as the others talked a bit. When the conversation seemed to lag a bit he jumped in. **"Ok, first I want to apologize for Marina and I talking in private for a few moments. She received some information just prior to us leaving that she wanted to share with me first and it's something that I want all of you to see."** He indicated the holorecorder that Marina was holding.
**"We'll get to that in a moment. There's one thing I want to talk about before the mission starts and we have to start playing our ruse. We need to forgo any titles among us first and foremost."** He looked over them all and stopped on Stone. **"Despite training and protocols that is normally followed, just call me Karn when we're out of the ship among others. Here on the ship though if you want the formality I'm alright with that but it's not needed."**
He looked at Marina and then to the others **"Now the video. I want everyone to see this as we all have a stake in this mission. It wasn't what I expected."**
He at down next to Marina. **"Go ahead."** He said to her as he sat back to watch the vid again. He also watched the others for reactions. That is if there was any.

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Alicia** (2010-01-06 23:08:17)

With a nod, Marina stood, placing the holorecorder for all to see before activating it. Returning to her seat, she leaned back in her chair. She didn't need to watch it again. Like Karn she was interested in the reactions of her companions.
As the recording starts to play you see the same man from the holoimage with his arm extended out and holding whoever is recording the video. The picture turns to the right and you see an arm in gunmetal armor being pulled on by the large man. Suddenly you hear a quite pop and a yell of pain as the picture turns back to the man. "I told you if you just join me none of this would have happened. With a man like you on my team we could save the republic from this war and wipe out the Sith." the man says calmly. You here a bit of grunting before you hear a clone's voice "Like hell I'm tuning on any Jedi that doesn't join you."
"Pity, perhaps after I pull your arm off you'll rethink your choice." You see the man start to pull on the clones arm a bit more and hear another pop follow by another yell in pain. Suddenly there is a large blast behind the man followed by a hellfire of blaster bolts. "You coward!! drop him right!!" You hear the familiar voice of commander Al'verde as the picture falls back and you see the black armored man flying over head with his jet pack. You hear a loud crack as the picture jolts then falls to the left. You here the battle for a second or two before the two men come into the picture trying to kill each other.
"You must be Al'verde." the man says as he takes a step back. Al'verde walks forward "Yeah and now that you know my name you're a dead man." As he speaks you can almost hear the smile in his voice as he raises his left arm up and brings it down with all his strength. Just before the hammer smashes in the man's head his left arm snaps up and you hear a loud bang, much like the sound of metal clashing with metal "Perhaps you will see my point better then. I am not trying to fight the republic but trying to save it...from itself. The Jedi in charge now have grow weak in this time of peace and can not deal with the Sith and the CiS. So I intend to over throw the Jedi and have plans for an all out frontal assault on key CiS planets. If it works then the war will end and the republic will be saved. After that I will take over the senate and use military leader to help me plan the next best action. We both know that those who hold the power are the only ones fit to lead." Al'verde lets up for a second, as if he was thinking about the idea, just enough for the other man to plant his right fist into Al'verde's gut. Al'verde stepped back holding his gut as the other man turned and walked away "Think about it commander, I'll be waiting in the Roon system. Send anyone else and they die."
You see Al'verde drop to one knee and take aim with his blaster cannon but he doesn't fire. He quickly turns to the clone "Matsun!! Warm up the Spire we need to get Wraith medical care asap!!!!" You see the commander reach down and the video ends.

"Now, isn't this a rather disturbing series of events." Verc replies calmly, leaning back into the couch, and folding her arms over her chest in a thinking gesture.
"Either the Commander's Answer is "No", Or he's sending us to test the resolve of the Former Jedi." Verc then makes a motion for Karn and Marina to continue, as she's sure this isn't the only surprise.

Karid watched the recording with considerably less interest than might be expected. Or rather, the interest he showed at the start waned as he saw where the events depicted led.
He listened to Verc's response and shrugged. Whatever his own thoughts were he kept to himself for now though, and he looked toward Karn and Marina with an unaffected expression as though waiting for some *real* news.

Beneath his mask Dorn's eye's narrow as he studies the recording, more annoyed than anything by the result. Annoyed that this information had been withheld from him until now. He'd learned in the past that you couldn't trust those who wouldn't give you the full picture. After it finished he did smirk slightly beneath the crimson, "Oh that does sound like a challenge to me,"he looked around the room again before finally adding, "My fee goes up when I'm lied to."

---

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Yogi** (2010-01-07 12:10:42)

Karn looked around as Verc made a comment about that they had seen.
Quite frankly he didn't know what the Commander wanted other than what he had told them in the briefing. This video changed things somewhat. Not only were they dealing with a fallen Jedi. The Jedi in question believed that he was saving the Republic from itself. One who believed that what he was doing was right no matter the cost or steps that had to be taken to achieve it. It was the worst kind of situation.
It was Dorn's comment that got a response from him as he looked at the mercenary. **"Mr. Kol if more payment is what you need for your services I suggest that you contact your representative that brought you in on this mission and ask them when we get back. I have no authorization to pay you more. So you can either work with us according to your current contract or go back when we drop out of hyperspace and demand more. Either way we will continue on, with or without you."**
The slight irritation that Dorn had risen in the Jedi Master was nothing new. It happened when mercs were involved. To them it's always about the money. With control and many years of practice the irritation was handled and pushed aside.
Karn waited for any more comments.

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Tempeste** (2010-01-07 15:24:18)

"Oh it's not about the money," replied Dorn as he turned to face the Jedi, "I just really dislike being lied to." He'd noticed how they'd questioned his motives for taking part in the mission, and it was true he was doing it for the money. But taking down a traitorous jedi was a bonus, if they could do it before he killed anymore innocent people it'd be a real job well done. "I find it hard to trust employers who keep important information away from me. The Republic and CIS are both as bad as each other, sometimes it's not so hard to see why they do what they do. At the end of the day I was hired to make sure you get to Roon alive, I intend to do that still. Don't make it hard for me."

"Then lets focus on the mission." Verc relies, standing up and moving over to the holoprojector. She inserted a card of her own, and it brought up a map of the core systems. "From what I've learned of the Roon system, they are technologically backwards. They don't upgrade a system, as long as it still works. So its safe to assume they are in need of spare parts for they're older systems. So we'll be taking on cargo here: In on the Scrapyard planet Belgaroth. Hopefully it will be a simply boring layover, as we load the ships cargo bay with whatever looks functional.
"Hopefully, with a cargo to serve as cover, we'll avoid local suspicion. But there is going to be a bigger issue. The only way to enter the Roon system, is by going though a region of space called the "Cloak of the Sith."

When Marina started the holo, Bucky stopped eating the minute the image showed a clone being tortured. His grip on the spoon tightened significantly, as did his grip on the table he sat at. So much so that the table began to creak under the pressure. A low rumble started in the depth of the Wookiee's chest and only grew louder as the holo continued. When the holo finally finished, the rumble had turned into a deep growl. Red colored the edges of Bucky's vision as he thought only one thing, something that also expressed between the rumbles of his growls.
**"ah … ohahanan … orahanan … aoacraao … scrawh … … canooohanro."**

While Stone watched the video he hadnt realized he was finishing his second helping and moving onto a third. Thinking to himself **Why didnt that clone fight back? Many manuavers were thought to us on how to escape those holds. Did the jedi just turn and attack his men while they were fighting these driods?**
Stone kept silent keeping his thoughts to himself as he worked out the fighting style the rouge jedi used.

Marina had watched the mixed reactions of those around her. "This information was held from all of us, for what reason we may never know. There's nothing we can do about it now except continue on and use what we know so we're prepared for any trap which Docol may have prepared." Looking at their Wookie companion she hoped he would calm himself.
She indicated the holo recording of the system Verc now had displayed. "We should concentrate on what information we have." Leaning forward onto the table, she cradled her chin with one hand laying the other on the table, her palm face down as she studied the display. "What do we know about this 'cloak of the sith', Doctor?"

"Aside from its properties as an astrological hazard, I'm afraid I don't know. I asked General Karn to look into it while he was accessing the Jedi Archives." Verc answered, returning to her seat. "I'm afraid that that's all I really have to present at the moment."

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Yogi** (2010-01-08 23:46:29)

Karn nodded from his seat when Verc mentioned his search at the Jedi Archives. **"Yes and I was able to find out something."** He paused for a second to recall it from his memory. He had it on his datapad but he didn't need it for this.
**"Like Verc said it's an astrological hazard in that it's somewhat inaccessible. Only one hyperspace route is known. From what was recorded it is considered by most to be a challenge for seasoned astrogators. The connection between Roon and Ryloth is known as the 'Death Wind Corridor'. There wasn't any mention of the 'Cloak of the Sith' in the Archives."**

'I really would expect the Jedi to know about a name like "Cloak of the Sith"', Karid commented, looking at Verc's holoimage with a meagre amount of interest, attention piqued by the unusual name.
He realised he was hardly contributing to the dialogue by making the comment and decided to voice his thoughts on the Marina's holorecording after all, to at least make an attempt of inclusion.
'About this little betrayal,' he began, 'I don't think it changes a single thing.'
He sat forward in his chair, looking around as he spoke but finally focusing his attention on Karn.
'For a start, I've had my trust betrayed by people I believed in before and it stings a lot less when I didn't place much trust in the first place. There was always going to be more to this mission than met the eye, we have to expect the brass to withhold information from us. I may be new to war, but I know enough to realise intelligence is hoarded until "necessary". In any case, Al'verde had to send someone other than himself, as doing otherwise would have been tantamount to accepting Docol's terms. The fact that he hid the Jedi's threat from us? Well, we were always at risk of death. That this unwelcome truth is now evident, as it were from the tauntaun's mouth, is simply confirmation of the facts. Nothing *has* changed. The mission remains the same, as do the conditions we undertake the mission in.'

The red started to bleed from the edges of Bucky's vision and he began to be aware of the conversation of those around him. It seemed that some of them were upset about being left out of the loop earlier with this intel.
*What does it matter if we know now? Besides, I now know what my personal mission is going to be.*
Looking over the table at the others, Bucky stopped shaking and sat back slowly and purposefully in his chair, his massive frame creaking the chairs supports. He woofed softly and quietly, though with enough volume to be heard by all.

Karn looked at Bucky first, rather that Karid, as the Wookie expressed his eagerness to take on Docol. **"Easy my big friend. Our first priority is to find him and find out what we can and see if he can be turned from this course of action. Failing that or if it proves to be impossible then we'll be forced lock blades with him and his droids. Though I hope that it doesn't come to that."** 
Looking back at Karid who's thought on the matter was that things hadn't changed with the mission. **"You are right Karid nothing in the mission has changed. We proceed as before except now we have a bit more information to work off from. Point being he will not be happy to see us since he's expecting Al'Verde. And as far as not knowing about the 'Cloak of the Sith', while the Archives holds vast amounts of knowledge it does not hold everything. Nor can we expect it to. I think our cover will be a good one. We go in with the same plan, junk traders. He may feel the presence of the Force users on the ship but that's a chance we'll have to take."**

As the hyperdrive continued to hum the ship passed through light speed getting closer and closer to it's first destination. After the meeting everyone went about their personal tacks until it was just about time for the ship to drop down to sub-light speeds. As the ship slowed down and then planet Belgaroth came into view it was clear that this was a junk planet. However as the ship moved closer to the planet anyone in the cockpit could see two large Action VI Transport frigates with three Carrack-Class Light Cruisers. As you approach the do not make any attempt to contact you, nor do they take hostile actions towards you. It seems that they don't care about the smaller ship or that they have their attention else where.
Suddenly the ships comms came to life "This is Belgar Spaceport to unknown transport, please identify yourself and your business with Belgaroth."

"This is Captan Adlor, of the *Void Prophet*. We are currently in need of a cargo, and was hoping to secure one here." Verc replied to Control. She saw no reason to lie to them over her intentions in the system, after all it was totally legitimate reason.
The past few hours had forced Verc into a near rush, as she hide her bottle of Correlian Brandy, along with other food stuff and items of value that she didn't want disturbed by her "Passengers".

Bucky had been sitting in the cargo bay of the Prophet, working out and keeping himself limber. He'd also spent some time making sure his energy cells were charged and ready to go, that his bandolier was loaded with extra quarrels for the bowcaster, and that his rocket pack was fully charged and ready to roll with a fresh fuel pack.
Feeling the shudder of the ship exiting hyperspace, Bucky spent a few minutes putting on his armor, strapping on his utility belt, draping his bandolier over his chest, hooking his vibro-ax to his belt, slinging his bowcaster across his back next to the rocket pack, and finally picking up his power hammer.
Fully armed and armored, Bucky stomped up to the common area, not wanting to interfere with the cockpit and the pilots.
He was certain of one thing, though. May the Force help anyone that tried to stop them from getting on their way.
Bucky now stood in the common area, waiting for the ship to land and his job to begin; clearing a path for the mission.

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-13 11:11:32)

Like Bucky, Karid had chosen to spend his time on physical tasks in the comparatively open space of the cargo bay, choosing practice his martial arts and Matukai exercises. He approved of Bucky's way of spending time, and did his beast not get in the Wookiee's way. Hopefully, he thought, this evidence of similar disposition was a sign that they would get along despite the communication barrier.
Upon the ship's abrupt exit from hyperspace, the orange-eyed martial artist shook his limbs out then crouched to open the metal case he'd brought onboard along with his other possessions.
He doubted he'd need his wan-shen, but who knew? He would regret deeply if the weapon were still unassembled on the ship in the event of needing it.
Taking the component parts from the box with due reverence, he assembled them into a complete polearm. Karid's weapon was a shining and artfully designed item, with beautiful patterning on the faces of its blade and along the pole. It was clearly the result of much loving care in its craftsmanship.
With the elegant weapon in hand, he followed Bucky to the common room.

Dorn had probably spent months of his life in hyperspace by now, it was truly boring. Waiting to reach your destination so you can get to work in whatever battlezone you've been hired to wage war in. He quickly learned how to deal with the problem though, and simply slept whenever he had to. It was too easy to spend time aboard the ship obsessing over what was to come and forgetting that once on the ground, you'd be lucky to get a few hours of sleep a day. He'd simply stayed in his chair in the common room and had his legs up on the table. His armour was vacuum sealed, so it was easy to turn off all incoming sound and have his helmet deal with the ships lights. It was a nice setup, and let him get as much undisturbed sleep as he needed, though there was the matter of waking up, which he probably could have done with more practice with.

Marina was thankful for the extended trip to the planet. Not only did it provide for ample opportunity to catch up on some much needed rest, but she was able to review their situation once more through meditation. Her restlessness eventually took her to the cargo bay where she found a secluded corner and began working through the martial arts katas her master had drilled into her. Meditation through action as her master had put it. She spotted as Karid and Bucky procured their own space and as each of them went through their own routine.
At one point she paused watching as Karid went through his own fluid motions, but she didn't bother him, instead she made note of the techniques she recognized and those she didn't. Something to attempt later on, she supposed when the time arose.
When Karid had gathered the long case she had first supposed was for a sniper rifle, she was surprised to see the unique polearm. Standing up beside him she looked it over, "It's quite beautiful. I've never seen one of this design before." She commented moving with him as he followed Bucky. "What do you call it?" Rubbing a towel behind her neck as she walked she tossed it over one shoulder, her jacket slung over her arm.

As Bucky walked towards the common area, he heard Marina behind him mention something about a unique weapon. Turning his head just enough to look out the corner of his eyes, Bucky looked up and down the weapon. To Bucky, it seemed a bit small and thin, but he'd learned to not judge things right away. Hooting and woofing slightly over his shoulder, Bucky continued to walk towards the common area.

Stone had kept to the common areas most of the flight not wanting to conflict with Verc he out right didnt talk to. He made sure that his weapons were locked and loaded incase oisk hit the fan. It made Stone chuckle when Verc scrambled around hiding her sweets as if Bucky and himself one hadnt noticed and two couldnt sniff them out.
Stone heard commotion from Bucky as the wookie made way. Stone was polishing off his gruel that only he and Bucky seemed to have a liking to.

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-14 00:57:14)

As she watched him and practiced her own disciplines, Karid became aware of Marina and once again had reason to think they might be of like mind. Not only had she expressed a similar opinion when he had talked to her earlier, but now she seemed to be displaying knowledge and interest in martial arts.
'This is a wan-shen', he willingly explained as they walked toward the common room, happy to talk to someone he had begun to see as a peer. I suppose you could say it's about as essential for my style as a lightsaber is for a Jedi. It would seem you're familiar with the martial arts yourself, so I hope at some point you will allow me to test myself against you.'
Karid then listened to Bucky's question while failing to understand it. He looked genuinely bothered by the fact he is unable to fathom the Wookiee's meaning.
'I'm sorry friend,' Karid said to the Wookiee 'I only wish I knew what you were saying. It's a real shame that I've not had much dealings with Wookiees before now, it would make things so much easier between us. Marina, I beg your pardon, but are you able to translate?'

---

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Alicia** (2010-01-14 10:12:31)

Marina looks over the weapon once more, "It has been awhile since I have been able to test myself against a worthy opponent. It would be a great pleasure if you would spar with me." Her attention turned to Bucky as he too expressed interest in the blade. "Bucky was also curious about the Wan-shen, though he also asks of it is a ceremonial weapon like a Ryk blade." It didn't bother Marina to have to translate. As she stepped into the common room with Bucky and Karid, she spotted Stone finishing off the "stew" he had made toward the beginning of the trip.
The warning kept popping back into her head every time she looked at Stone and for a brief moment she wondered if it would affect her ability to efficiently work with him. It might, she realized. While Karn and Bucky seemed to know and trust him from long experience, she didn't know him all that well. Maybe that was something she should resolve first and then make the decision whether to take the warning to heart.
Moving deeper into the common room she took a seat across from Stone. "I saw our good doctor hid her sweets. A real shame." she reached down and pulled from a pouch a small foil wrapped packaged. Unfolding it revealed several small cubes of a dark substance. "I got these on my last mission. I'd be glad to share them with you all." she said looking at Bucky and Karid behind her, to include them. "I found them far to rich for my tastes." She didn't mention that for the past few weeks she had been living off such tasteless gruel and food cubes that seemed to be the staple of any soldier's diet.

Karn was sitting atop his bunk on the *Void prophet* deep in meditation when his physical senses felt the ship drop out from orbit. Quickly he recovered from his meditative state as he swung his feel to the floor. He was troubled. Normally he could gain some insight on the future but lately he had been unsuccessful. He quickly squashed the thought of the Jedi Order loosing their connection to the Force. His connection was still as strong as ever.
Standing he made sure all his things were in place. Satisfied he left the room and walked into the common room just as Marina was handing out some sweets to the others. He looked at Stone and then back to Marina. Their earlier conversation about the clone and the warning was again brought to mind.
**"Sweets?"** Karn said with a grin. **"A good way to make friends. Always has, always will be. And it tastes better that the barely passable food that the Republic Military hands out."**

As the others started to enter the common area Stone cleaned up his mess of weapons and parts quickly to make room for them. Stone had never worked with a jedi he didn't like although he certainly worked with a few eager padawans and Knights who wound up neededing extraction from being surrounded. Marina troubled Stone, for some reason he felt as if she was keeping him at a distance as if she was scared of something about him. Stone was more perceptive then he lead on and wondered if something had happened since the begginning of this trip to put her and now what appears to be affecting Karn.
"Thank you, General Marina" Stone said as he took a peice of the sweet and chewed it slowly. "I'll have you know how ever crafty the doc hid her tricks Bucky could sniff them out in a second" Stone said in a quite manner chuckling.

"Very well. Proceed to port eight and keep in mind that the only weapons you are allowed to have on you are pistols. All others must be left on your ship." The comm cut out. As you start your approach you think you think you can see what looks like a symbol on one of the bulk transports but you can't tell right off hand. As you take a closer look you make out the marking of what look like the symbol used by the Pirates of Iridium, but as far as you know they were all wiped out almost three years ago.

Marina laughed heartily, the sound flowing easily from her lips, showing her usual cheerful disposition. "**I've always enjoyed sharing sweets then keeping them to myself anyways.**" These sweets she had planned to share with Arek and Wraith, the former she had not had much opportunity to spend some spare time with. If they ate all of them she supposed she would have to find something else. "**And I must say the certainly better than any field rations the military provides. Much more enjoyable.**" She wondered briefly if she should mention the jerky she also had in her pouch. The jerky, however not very filling, had been an interesting supplement to the rations she had been eating to keep her strength up. It was now almost gone.
Her laughter ceased, and she considered Stone, the smile still present in her eyes. "**Call me Marina, please. I never was one for all the military protocol. And Bucky is wise. It's best not to upset Verc too much more or she may feel the need to teach a lesson.**" She paused and picked up a small cube from the foil, which she had now set on the table. Breaking it into smaller pieces she slowly chewed on it. "**We are on her ship after all. We must be courteous guests.**"

Verc took a moment to look over the symbol a few extra moments, and filled it away for latter. But there were a few precautions she could take now, without seeming to be asking for trouble.

Dorn awoke as a voice filled his helmet and stimulated his dulled senses. He shook his head slightly before opening his eyes and setting his helmet to the normal functions again. "Yeah I copy," he lifted his legs off of the table and then stood up, now noticing the rest of the group has assembled. "See you planetside," he added before heading towards the airlock and entering his ship. He set about getting ready to launch and once ready sent a message to the Void Prophet's pilot, "I'm ready, disengage the clamp."

**"Thanks Marina."** Karn said as he finished the piece.
He sat quietly for a moment before speaking. **"Well we've got our way in. Now all we have to do is stay as low keyed as possible."** the Jedi Master said as he leaned back into his seat getting comfortable. They still had some time till they touched down.

Marina's eyes had closed mid chew of another small piece of the sweet, almost as if she was savoring the treat. In reality she was trying to reach out and find the source of the strange contact. A frown of concentration creased her brow. Who ever it was had reached out to them, but hadn't want his presence discovered. Otherwise, she surmised, she would have sensed things more clearly.
"Did you feel that presence? I couldn't tell who it was, you?" Karn said beside her. She shook her head before opening her eyes and swallowing.
"**No, it's rather strange.**" She reached out and took what was remaining of the sweets she had set out on the table, wrapping it back up and putting them in her pouch. "**Another mystery.**" Feeling the change as they moved into the atmosphere, she looked over at Bucky. "**We've just entered the atmosphere so I doubt it will be too much longer before we touch down.

'I appreciate it, but it would be wasted on me. I must have been a young trainee the last time I ate such a thing, I doubt I still even have the taste for it.'
Later, as the two Jedi reacted each in their own way to the touch of a presence in the Force planet-side, Karid also showed signs of a reaction.

"**It's not exactly affiliated with anyone last time I checked. It's pretty much a trash planet so not many come here.**" She looked over the clones white battle damaged armor realizing that once they reached the Roon system one look at him at their ruse they were preparing would be over. "**I think we'll be safe enough here.. but the Roon system is another issue,**" she frowned trying to think of the best way to go about this. Clones were ever so protective about their armor.

As the two ship set down there is a high pitched creaking sound and the landing pad stresses under the weight of the two ship. As you look around, the space port has a worn down look to it, patch jobs have not been painted over, wires exposed, and other things tell you that the planet is not supported by anyone or if it is they do not care much about this planet. The gray clouds that cover the sky along with the greenish brown liquid that seem to fill every hole do not help. As the ships open up anyone with out a sealed helmet on is immediately bombarded with a wide arrangement of smells, most of them not very pleasant.
As the ramp of the *Void Profit* is lowered a man who lookd to be in his mid thirties with brown hair down to just past his shoulders. The man is wearing some type of battle armor, but it hard to tell due to the fact that the armor seem to be made up from different parts. The light repeater however is easily noticed, as are the two custom droids that have had their right arms replaced with CR-1 blast cannons. The yellow visors of the droids show no signs of where they might be looking. The man shows no expression on his face as he pulls out a lighter and lites the cigar clenched between his teeth. The man takes a deep breath in, causing the edge of the cigar to glow bright red, and slowly exhales, not pulling the cigar away.
The man looks over the freighter and the fighter before taking another hit off the cigar and pulls the light repeater up "Alright No one get past me until I know you're safe. We know there's war going on and we don't want anyone to bring it here." he says is a low scruffy voice.

"Do I look like a battle droid to you?" he stated sarcastically whilst observing the somewhat heavily armed droids. He was thankful for the fully sealed suit and physiology of his species, it may have been a hassle sometimes and borderline uncomfortable, but it had it's benefits. Now was one of those times.

As the ramp lowered and Bucky's nostrils were assaulted by the smells of the planet, he pulled his head back and woofed and sneezed in an attempt to rid himself of the stench. Looking down the ramp, he saw the battle droids and the armored individual. Seeing Verc walk towards the person, he followed right behind her, armored feet clunking down the plank.
Holding his hammer in his hands, he woofed and barked.

The man eyes the Wookie and Kel Dor "Right you're just walkinging around in battle armor because you like the way it feels on your skin. give me one good reason to think that you're not bring trouble with you." As he speaks a commlink cherps no worrds are exchanged as he stands there looking at the group ready to openfire. Finely the man lets out a small sigh "Look you've been told the rules. Anything besides a pistol and I call in the rest of my secruity force. Besides I'm not a dumb as you think I am. I know you're not droids" he says before muttering something (Perception to try and hear it if you want to know) "Now do me a favor and leave all your weapons on your ship. Like I said you can bring pistols but if I hear the you started trouble in my port then I'm sicking my tanks on you. I'm not playing games here people." As he speaks the two droids load thier blast cannons. "Oh and if you think you can get past me and my two friends here the automated weapons will take care of you." he add with a smile "So the big question is...Do you feel lucky?"

Karn walked down with the others and listened as things began to get out of control between the security officer and the others. He tried to listen in as the man muttered to himself. He stepped forward as the man offered up a threat to the group ***Best to put an end to his now before it gets out of hand.*** He thought.
He kept his posture relaxed thumbs hooked in his belt, hand not far from his blaster pistol on his side. Not threatening but closed enough to get it out quickly if needed. **"We are here for cargo that is all. We have no intention of causing trouble or looking for it. The sooner we can get to our business the quicker we can conclude it and be on our way leaving you and your droids to do whatever it is that you do here. If pistols is all that is allowed that that is what we will follow. Satisfactory?"** Though Karn had no intention of leaving his own hidden weapons behind unless he had to. He sent that feeling through the Force to Marina and Karid. He was sure Marina would. Not having known Karid long he wasn't sure if the young Force user would get his meaning. Karn looked from side to side for the automated defenses the man had mentioned.

Karid sighed and nodded his understanding. If the rules would not allow his wan-shen, then insisting on bringing it would serve no good purpose.
Personally, he questioned the sense of a rule that allowed the carrying of high-powered ranged energy weapons but not a simple pole-axe, but chose not to comment in view of the fact it probably wouldn't expedite the dialogue's satisfactory conclusion.
Receiving a sense of Karn's true intent through the Force, Karid smiled. He too, would not be bound by these rules. He had a potent weapon that could never be taken from him: his own body.
Returning up the ramp to fetch his wan-shen's protective carrying case, he once again dismantled and stowed away the weapon. He felt under equipped without it, but hardly naked. While it was a symbol of who he was, the wan-shen was not a necessary aspect of his identity.

Marina stepped off the ship, her only visable weapon being the heavy blaster pistol she had at her hip. Putting on a breath mask she hoped it would ease the coming stench from the wasted planet. Stepping past Stone, she was glad he took the fact he stood out to heart and resolved to find something on the planet which might server to disguise him. She patted him on the shoulder as she stepped off the ship, taking her first look around.
Heaving a sigh, she quickly realized finding cargo underneath all the trash was going to be difficult. Deciding to leave the negotiations to Karn and Verc she tried to get a feel for where the best place to start her search for suitable cargo would be.

As the message came across his comm link he looked at it and quickly sent the 'affirmative' back to Stone. Marina was right earlier. He would stick out like a sore thumb.
Before the man could answer the Jedi Bucky asked if the concession he made on weapons was the right one. Karn nodded at the big Wookie but held up a hand to forestall any more questions as he looked back at the security officer.
**"If a member of our party forgoes carrying a blaster sidearm would they be allowed to carry a melee weapon for their defense instead. A fair trade off, maybe. Like I said we just want to purchase some cargo and be on our way as quickly as possible."** Karn let the Force flow outward from him letting it wash over the guard. Feelings of trust and friendship fled to the man in an effort to sway the mans position on the weapons.

"It's almost like you're expecting a fight," said Dorn as he glanced down at his armour. It wasn't exactly inconspicuous but with the war going on, no-one would be blamed for walking around in protection. And besides, he thought it looked quite good on him. "And as for luck, there's no such things. Just calculated risk and probability. If you rely on luck you've already lost." Dorn almost wished he'd stayed in the Red Giant, but then he wouldn't get paid if they got ambushed by whatever beasts may live on this world and killed. The man seemed overly defensive to him though, as if he had something to hide or had already had the war inflict things upon him.

As Karn walked down the ramp he instantly picked something up from the conversation "At least they don't look like droids, but from what I've heard. That no longer matters." he muttered. Other things tipped off his senses, There were quite a few automated turrets on the landing pads. Marina also noticed the weaponry but she also notices that most of the weapons have been installed poorly, like it was a rush job. Also as she looks around you can see that some of the junk has been separated into ships parts and everything else. You get the feeling that this is not going to be that easy.
The man looked at the newcomers and locked eyes with the kel dor "Trust me luck as saved my hide more than once." he smiled before looking at the male human "Satisfactory?...no. Things will only be satisfactory when you do things my way. As for the melee weapon...no. Pistols attract less unwanted attention, and from the looks of things you're already going to get plenty of that." The man did not budge as he took another hit off the cigar then slowly let the smoke roll out from his teeth. "Look you don;t like the rules then you can bug off. I've got other things to attend to."

Karn looked harder at the man when he posed no presence in the Force. Different from a droid since even a droid could be felt through the Force. This man simply seemed to not be there. Never had he seen something like this. Surely it was something to take note of and talk about it with Marina and maybe even Karid about.
He looked at the strange man, neither of their expressions changing. ***We need the cargo His way it will have to be then.*** He looked at Bucky and nodded. **"Sidearms only my friend. Looks lke you will have to smile any any possible threats in order to give them pause this time."** Karn gave the Wookie a half smile. The Jedi knew that the Wookie's smile could be just as good of a deterrent as any weapon.
Looking back at the security man Karn nodded. **"Sidearms it will be then and out trip here will be concluded as quickly as possible. Under your gracious…hospitality."** Again he probed the man in front of him again getting the same feeling. He simply didn't exist in the Force. Karn made a mental note to record his findings later when he had a chance.

Letting and audible growl escape his throat, Bucky turned around and clomped back up the boarding ramp of the Prophet. Finding his chests, he quickly punched in the access code to open the main one. Carefully laying his hammer inside, he unhooked his ax from his belt and placed it in as well. Next, he unslung his bowcaster and laid it inside as well. Finally, he took his dire-vibroblade out from behind his back and flipped the weapon in his hand to hold the blade end.
Turning his head to look back down the ramp, he contemplated trying to hide the weapon, but decided against it. He'd trust Karn on this one.
As Bucky shut the chest and moved to rejoin his comrades, he considered staying behind with Stone, but then decided against it. With both Stone and Bucky on the ship, the group would have less protection, and that was something that Bucky just didn't want to think about.
Stomping down the ramp again, Bucky raised his hands to both sides to show that he was now completely unarmed. All he had on him was his armor and rocket pack.
*Of course, that's a weapon too.*
That thought made the Wookiee smile.

Still inside the ship, Karid watched Bucky disarm himself with a grimace.
*I wonder how the loss of all those affects his combat ability. I know wookiees are meant to be strong, but how is his skill?*
*We will just have to see.*
He follows down the boarding ramp, now clearly only carrying two sidearm pistols holstered at his hips. Bucky and Marina may realise that he still has his wan-shen, only the polearm is broken up and stored back in its metal case which is worn strapped to his back.

Verc sighed, as she walked over to the clone trooper. She held out her Scattergun to the man. "Mind loaning me your side arm, since your staying with the ship? I'll let you hang onto my gun as collateral if you'd like."
Her tone was polite without the the haughtiness that she spoke to him with earlier. Since she was now wearing her armor, it was hard to see her actually facial expression.

Stone presented Doc with his side arm in exchange for her scatter gun. Taking the scatter he looked it over in awe about how well its condition was. Maybe he had misjudged Verc.
"Doc if you dont mind I think ill keep the ship prep'd for launch I get an uneasy feelin about this place. Also this button her makes the side arm more interesting" Stone said as he pointed to what made the side arm attack an area.

## Re: Alternate Saga Campaign

### **Avarna** (2010-01-23 21:53:14)

The Scattergun was indeed in very good condition, as some of the clone troopers she'd saved before meeting Stone had shown her every trick to keeping the weapon in top shape.
"That you Commander." Verc replied, taking the sidearm, and paying attention to what he showed her, before finding a loop for it on her utility belt. When he mentioned keeping the ship ready for launch she nodded, "Yes, That would be a wise precaution. Hopefully we won't be long."
Verc then walked down the ramp to join the rest of those who were willing to brave the polluted air. "The best place to start, would be with one of the scrap dealers, I believe."

Karn watched as the other went back into the ship to leave their larger weapons behind. He was glad that they all complied other wise this was going to be a short trip in getting the junk they needed for their cover. Karn looked back at the security officer. The same one that wasn't there in the Force.
No that wasn't right. Karn could sense him by the fact that he didn't exist in the Force. All around the man the Force was there. He simply created a void where he was standing. Smiling he waved a hand at the others as he looked at the man. **"We have done as you asked. Now if you don't mind we would like to make this stop as short as possible.

Marina eyed the stacks of ship parts, her gaze never staying in one place as she attempted to figured out where to start. With a heavy sigh she moved back over toward Karn, waiting for the "negotiations" to cease. She looked over the turrets again as they continued, wondering if it would be in their best interest to at some point attempt to make them inoperative. From their hasty construction she figured the needed safeguards hadn't been put in place and wouldn't be too hard. As long as she didn't get caught.
As she thought she fiddled with the heavy blaster pistol in the holster at her hip. After having practiced many times in drawing the weapon, the motion of preparation had become habit. Waiting she hoped the conversation would end soon and they could get to the hard part of finding usable cargo.

One last thing before you go. I need your names and in charge of the salvage run. If you need help finding something special I may be able to help you out."

Since his return Karid had been acting as though supremely disinterested in the discussion. As, in fact, he had been. Karn seemed to be doing a good job, and having too many people talking up and at odds with each other would have only roused suspicions they were not a typical crew.
He speaks up when asked for his name, however, but only after quickly creating a pseudonym for the occasion:
'The name is Weylan Tessel,' he said in a bored tone.
In his mind Karid began forming a persona around his fictitious new identity, just in case.

**"Name's Wedge Starkiller. As for who's in charge of the cargo run that would be the Captain."** Karn didn't offer any more than that. Verc would have to step up and deal with the man.
He stepped off to the side and walked over to Marina to stand next to her. This time he reached out to her and then out to the guard. He sent along the feeling that she should take a closer look at the guard. This time, same as before, Karn only sensed a void in the Force. Almost as if he didn't exist in it.

As the droids turned Marina and Karn noticed a symbol on their backs. It was the symbol used by the Pirates of Iridium, however it looks like some did a poor job of trying to remove them. There are also what look like kill counts under the symbols. The man looked at the group as they introduced themselves and looked back at Weylan "Mr. Tessel eh? That name sounds familiar" he thought for a moment as his index finger ran along his jaw line "Sounds like a guy I had to boot off this planet about week ago for stealing some goods...you wouldn't happen to be the same guy now would you?" he asked placing the cigar between his teeth again and raising his repeater.
As the scene continued to unfold Marina reached out she started to feel the same void as Karn but then she realized that he was not a void in the force but in fact he was a very powerful user that was attempting to block out any force users in the area. Verc Had no trouble finding a terminal right next to the ramp. While trying to access junk dealers was was easy enough, finding one that would not rip her and the other off, now that was the trick. None of them listed any information about the dealers themselves, but jut listed the parts and other services that they offered.

"**We're here to provide business not cause trouble. If you don't want our business then we'll go somewhere else and you'll have lost an opportunity.**" Finally she looks at the man; a man in his own right who was apparently a powerful Force User.
This was turning more into a detour then she supposed any of them originally planned.

Feeling Marina's hand on his arm caused Bucky to weigh his options carefully. Without a doubt he'd stepped into the situation without thinking it through carefully. That tended to get one killed. However, in the split second it took him to rethink the situation, he realized that he'd have done it no differently at all anyway. Someone had threatened his team mate. That never sat well with Bucky.
Hearing the man's comments about staying out of trouble, and seeing him walk off, Bucky made no comment like *"you'd better walk off"* or anything else as idiotic. The moment had passed and no one was hurt. That was a good thing.

Bucky and Karid echoed his thoughts as they voiced their concerns about staying on the planet. He nodded as they both talked. Looking back the way the man left He still felt something odd about the mans absence in the Force. Marina mentioned nothing of it ss he let it go for now.
