<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Chapter One: Perdurance</span>
It is a time of desperation for the Separatists. The capture of the planet Tirahnn shut down a major source
of much needed resources for the Republic along the Perlemian Trade Route.
Dissidents of the controlled world are building up their forces using smugglers to import much needed weapons and supplies.
The Separatist fear the dissidents&#39; combined effort with a Republic invasion force will end their occupation of the planet.
Steps have been taken to control the resistance movements forming in the outlaying villages of the capital, Tirahnn,
sending patrols to gauge the movement&#39;s activity. Recently the sent patrols have been lost, causing unease and friction among the troops.
Word from the top is that it&#39;s time to send in an elite group to find out what, exactly, is responsible for the disappearances&#8230;

**Muurst**
Having been stuck on the world since the takeover of the planet, Murrst has been working to help maintain order. While the Trandoshan may not have the best people skills, he can certainly bully people around with the sight of his blaster rifle. Having heard the rumors of the lost patrols, it may have been only a matter of time before the higher ups called him in to get things done.
With orders to report to the small room converted into a war room, he arrives to find that the commander is already there, impatiently looking over a map of the surrounding area of the city Tirrahn. He doesn’t give the Trandoshan much notice as he enters, but seems to be instead waiting for the whole group to get there before going into his tirade.

Mursst stands silently in front of the commander, angered slightly that his usual "team" has been disbanded and he will be the only one on this particular mission. He waits in the briefing room without his armor on, the Trandoshan clad in ordinary-looking civilian clothing. He steals a glance at the map, hoping for some kind of hint other than the missing patrols of what he will be doing next.

**Vancero**
It's been awhile since you've done anything interesting since arriving on Terrahn. While the locals are friendly enough the local entertainment is hardly exciting under the Separatists occupation and since the best parties are held in the sky reaching buildings reserved for the cities' upper crust (who reportedly rarely even leave those buildings) Vancero is left to participate in the dull drills instituted for the organic participants of the Separatist forces. There's a bit of unease in the ranks, which is palpable. Increasingly more patrols are being lost near the outlaying villages and talk of revolt from the same has everyone, particularly the higher ups on edge.
When Vancero receives the orders to report to the war room,it's perhaps with some relief. Reporting as ordered, the noble sees a Trandoshan merc he recalls seeing about has already arrived and seems to be trying to get a better look at the map the commander in charge is pouring over as he waits for everyone to arrive. The commander barely gives the Human a passing glance as he enters.

---

The map is a familiar sight, having seen many of them over the course of occupation. This one shows the locations of several villages surrounding the capital Tirrahn with several dots of different colors marking some sort of information or another.

### **Vermillion** (2011-05-03 23:22:40)

Vancero strode in almost gliding, thrilled at the opportunity to alleviate his boredom. He tossed a quick wave at the commander, once again bemused by the silent treatment he receives. He then noticed the Trandoshan beside him, and offered a friendly yet short bow to the bounty hunter.
**Well, kind of rude to assume he is a bounty hunter,** he pondered. **Then again, they are ALL bounty hunters, right? Bah, who cares.**
As he continued to ponder the sociopolitical issues stemming from such a thought, he swung himself into a nearby seat, not really bothering to notice if the Trandoshan even acknowledged his greeting. Brushing a stray silver hair from his face, he took in the room, soaking in the tension.
**Ooooh, this must really be putting a burr in their boots. Means more fun for me…** 
He leaned in and took a closer glance at the map.

### **Alicia** (2011-05-04 17:22:21)

It's not much later before another being arrives in the room. Clad in a knee length dark cloak hiding the woman's figure, a tall middle aged woman appears in the doorway. One hand comes up to flick her sun streaked brown hair out of her face as she looks into the room, taking note of who was present before entering fully. She gives a casual nod to the Trandoshan and then to Vancero as she passes, taking a seat as close as she could to the commander. Bored she pulls from within her cloak a silver discblade, a curious enough weapon, and begins to play with it.
Having kept to herself since her arrival on Tirrahn, neither men know much about her. Though at the sight of the discblade her reputation proceeds her. This is Ketanna, who reportedly is quite a wicked combatant. Using her discblade she can effectively disarm, quite literally, a man within 30m, and can more often than not hit more than one target in a single throw. Neither have seen her in action so such reports could probably be exaggerated.

## Re: CIS - Chapter One: Perdurance

### **hayabusa** (2011-05-04 22:12:38)

As Vancero walks in, Mursst studies him quietly, watching the human's movements. Almost as if studying him. **'Is this who they're replacing my team with?'** the Trandoshan thinks to himself. His inner eyelids blink quickly and Mursst nods his head in a brief acknowledgement of Vancero's greeting.
He watches the arrival of Ketanna as well, knowing of her reputation as a good warrior but never having seen it for himself. It makes him somewhat skeptical. He nods at her greeting as well.
He turns his attention back to the commander as he works at the computer display. The Trandoshan speaks up, still retaining a good portion of his original accent. **"Is this everyone then?"** he asks, not fully liking the small numbers of the team. He turns his head, gauging the reactions of everyone after he finishes speaking.

## Re: CIS - Chapter One: Perdurance

### **Vermillion** (2011-05-05 00:15:58)

As the vision in black takes her seat, Vancero suddenly finds himself absolutely rapt in attention. It seems this job is getting better and better by the moment.
As he busies himself with the charade of professionalism, he forgets why he is there. Muursk's demanding question brings him back to reality...for now.
"Looks like it, my good man. I can't say this is optimal, but I'd say….", he takes a long look at Ketanna, "…..we will have to do our best with this new group dynamic. I certainly will."
A bright smile flashes across his face.

**"You are needed on Tirrahn. Make haste,"** was the entirety of the holorecording waiting for Umdrow as he boarded the *Merchant's Guard*, Lay Guun's flagship. As Dooku's image collapsed, Umdrow settled himself, meditating on the flora and fauna of the Ualaq Aqualish's rain forests, where he had been quelling an uprising for the last month by using scare tactics and assassinations. He did not notice when the fleet jumped to hyperspace, being far too engrossed in examining what he had learned from the few rain forests on a predominately water world.
--------
Two days later a droid piloted shuttle set down in the Separatist's command center on Tirrahn. A lone hooded figure who blended with the surroundings appeared. Great, graceful strides carried him quickly to towards the main structure.
--------
The door to the war room opens again, and air seems to part like water as the color-shifting cloak is turned back and hood taken down. It reveals a tall Ithorian with mottled brown skin and odd armor made of dozens of plant-like stone plates strides in. What seems to be a club of dark rich wood hangs from his belt. **"Commander,"** he says, his voice deep and echoing in stereo from his dual mouths, **"what is the situation?"** His question asked, he takes in the room, noting its occupants as unfamiliar, save for the female, whom he couldn't place. His stance is relaxed, almost as if his spine were attached to some invisible string and his limbs merely hanging from his body.

---

## Re: CIS - Chapter One: Perdurance

### **hayabusa** (2011-05-05 11:27:43)

Mursst turns his attention away from the commander once again as the Ithorian enters. **'It appears not,'** he thinks as he once again begins to wait for the briefing to begin. It is possible, he believes, that the mission is so different from the others that his own team had participated in that it needed such a new group. He shrugs slightly at the thought and continues his wait.

## Re: CIS - Chapter One: Perdurance

### **Alicia** (2011-05-05 12:58:24)

The woman glances over at Vancero, her spinning of the discblade barely halting as she eyes him much in the same manner as he had looked her over. With a bored look of disinterest she looks away from him.
With the final arrival, the commander looks up, finally acknowledging the others who had gathered. Moving from the map he stood next to the seat at the head of the table looking at each of the occupants in turn. “**Good, let’s get this over with,**” he say at last, his hands coming to rest flat in front of him on the table.
"**I'm sure you've also heard the rumors that have been going around. They're true – we've lost contact with a number of patrols recently. There's not much we can say about it, except you're the best we've got.**” Beside him, he enlarges the image of the map he had been studying and indicates a section on the map where numerous dots are laid out. The satellite images show a village in the vicinity.
"**Your assignment is to pass to the northwest and scout the perimeter of Liethae, a village with enemy sympathies. You are not to engage the inhabitants of Liethae unless you are attacked. However, we don't expect that the villagers will attack, even if they manage to spot you. We'd prefer that you refrain from being seen, so keep your heads down. All we want you to do is observe the village and note anything unusual.**
"**After you investigate Liethae proceed 10 clicks to the east to a clearing that looks to have been manufactured within the pas month or two. We suspect it's being used by smugglers who are bringing supplies and weapons to the enemy, but we have no proof. If you find patterns that are consistent with freighters landing in the clearing, high tail it back here with all speed and let us know. Better yet, if you can catch a freighter unloading material, try to discover what they're transporting.**”
The commander looks at each again in turn, and then nods a dismissal “**Good luck.**”

The Trandoshan studies the map as the commander briefs the group on the mission. He eyes topography if it's available on the holoimage, what appears to be the major routes into and out of the village along with any side roads that may be interesting.
**"How many beings are in the village?"** Mursst asks the commander. **"And what 'unusual' things should we keep a look out for? Something involving the clearing?"**

## Re: CIS - Chapter One: Perdurance

### **Magical2099** (2011-05-05 18:43:32)

**"We will need copies of the map, and what are we looking for in the village? Do you wish cams placed on the perimeter?"** Umdrow adds to the Trandoshan's good questions.
He takes a moment to concentrate on his allies. *The Trandoshan may prove useful, and doubly so if he be more than beast. The human is a wild card, like all his kind. The female more so,* he thinks, reaching out to learn more from the Force.

"**Bah**," the commander started, surly all of the sudden by the questions. "**If we knew what was going on we wouldn't be sending you lot now would we?. And surveillance is out of the question unfortunately. Don't have the man power to be sparing later on to be retrieving the devices. Just take a look around, you've got minds, use them, otherwise we might as well just be sending droids to do the work.**" As he speaks the commander pulls out a datacard from a pouch on his belt and inserts it into the computer. After a couple keystrokes he pulls it out and tosses it on the table to land in front of the Ithorian. "**You can report to the garage and a speeder can take you to the edge of the city, you'll have to make the rest of the way on foot. If you need it, the quartermaster can supply you each with a field kit and electrobinoculars.**"
Opening himself to the Force Umdrow discovers that two of his companions are adept in the learnings of it, the two young humans. While Vancero and Ketanna may have tried to hide their presence but it would be to no avail. Likewise as Umdrow seeks them out, he also leaves himself open to the knowledge he's Force sensitive as well. The woman stands after giving the Ithorian a long look, having not said a word during the briefing and with a nod to the commander and a general nod to her new teammates takes her leave of the war room.

*Force users? I wonder if either are as deluded as the Sith and Jedi,* he thinks on discovering the humans' talents.
Umdrow notes the petty man's attitude *Fool,* he thinks, done with the conversation. With a simple wave of his hand he uses the Force to bring the datacard to him. **"Do either of you have a datapad?"** he asks his new allies as he draws up his hood and closes his cape around him, its color blending properties causing mild nausea in onlookers. After hearing an answer he leaves the room, stopping by the quartermaster's to collect a pair of electrobinoculars before heading to the garage.

## Re: CIS - Chapter One: Perdurance

### **Vermillion** (2011-05-06 08:48:25)

Vancero smiles as he feels the familiar touch of a probing Force user. "Naughty fellow," he grins. "All you had to do was ask. And not even drinks beforehand? Even I'm not that easy." He takes another look at Ketanna. "Well, maybe for her."
He soaks in the scornful looks like raindrops on his skin. He really didn't care what they thought of him now. Quite frankly, anybody could watch the back of the quiet guy. It was the jerks that really separated the professionals from the hired muscle. If you could see all this preening and not take a swing, at least until the mission was over, then you had nerves of durasteel. Then again, looking at the collection of faces at the table, he figured they still might try to stab him, just once or twice, if only to teach him a few things. *That will just make things more interesting, won't it?*
"Eh, lost my 'pad in a quick sabacc game a day or two ago. Will hafta get a new one before we depart."
Seeing Ketanna rising to go, he leaps out of his seat and gives chase. "Soooooooo….my name is Vancero. So very nice to meet you. And yours?"

The woman sets a quick pace and her gaze comes to meet the young Noble's, her pace never wavering. "**Kentanna**," she says, at last. Her direction is taking her toward the quartermaster's, the walk itself not taking long. From there she acquires the field kit and electrobinculars offered by the droid waiting there. She takes out the all-temperature cloak from the kit and tosses it to the side before checking to make sure the rest of the contents were there. "**Have you ever been out in the wilderness?**" she asks at last.

## Re: CIS - Chapter One: Perdurance

### **Vermillion** (2011-05-06 13:35:28)

"I've done my time on a trek or two," he grinned. "Although I admit, I am still a spoiled child of civilization. If you have any tips, I am all kinds of open to any lesson you may want to teach me."
He turned and gestured for his supplies as well. He halfheartedly examines its contents, pretty confident that everything was there. **It wasn't like we were requesting starfighters or anything.** He stuffed everything back into the casing and grabs his binocs from the droid, stuffing them into the case as well.
"But I am such a boring topic, and you seem so much more…intriguing. What is your story?"

---

## Re: CIS - Chapter One: Perdurance

### **Magical2099** (2011-05-06 16:14:11)

Umdrow pauses at the quartermasters along with his allies. He ignores the field kit and clips the electrobinoculars to his waist before asking, **"Quartermaster, we will need datapads. Two for certain,"** as the deep stereo rumble subsides, he turns to look questioningly at the Trandoshan and Kentanna.

---

## Re: CIS - Chapter One: Perdurance

### **hayabusa** (2011-05-06 16:31:23)

Mursst walks with the others, silently listening in on the conversation for a while before finally speaking up. **"This wilderness?"** he states in response to Ketanna's question. **"No. I was stationed on the other side of this planet during the siege. Taking out patrols…"**
When he reaches the quartermaster of the base, he accepts the field kit but passes on the electrobinoculars. He looks to the other members of the newly formed team before excusing himself. **"I'll be getting my equipment now,"** he states. **I'll be back in a few minutes."**

---

## Re: CIS - Chapter One: Perdurance

### **Alicia** (2011-05-10 14:50:38)

The quartermaster passes out the equipment with little complaint even two basic datapads are added to the Ithorian's slim supplies.
"Nothing I care to share," Kentanna responds to the noble, looking disapprovingly as he only casually glances through his supplies. "I suppose we will see how much you know." She gives a nod to Muurst as he sets to leave to gather the rest of his gear. Her gaze falls to Umdrow. "And you Ithorian. I have not seen you around till now."

**"This is my first time on this planet. I was recently on Andor. Can you tell me anything about the local ecosystem?"** he replies, copying the map to one datapad and passing it to Vancero saying, **"Don't loose it."** He copies it to the other datapad, which he tucks into his belt. He turns back to Kentanna with the datacard in hand, **"Do you have a pad or shall we have the quartermaster issue another?"**

## Re: CIS - Chapter One: Perdurance

### **Vermillion** (2011-05-12 19:38:32)

Vancero sticks out his bottom lip and tries his best sad face before cracking up. "I see how it is. All business. No fun. Just do the job. Fine. We can play it that way. But I am telling you, that is no way to go through life people. That kind of mentality leads to stress. And it will kill you."
He takes the offered datapad, and shortly bowed to the Ithorian. "Much appreciated. And as long as we don't run into any dancing girls with big boyfriends on the local militia, I think this one will make it just fine." He flips on the device and checks it out. "Hmmmph. No games? These things can at least come with Simply Sabacc!

**"The datapads are not for your enjoyment,"** Mursst says as he re-enters the room after a couple of minutes being gone. He's wearing body armor across his entire body, the plasteel coverings painted a camoflage color (OOC: No in-game benefit, just flavor text). A few bits of the armor are scuffed and dented, but nothing too serious. The trandoshan finishes securing the armor before talking again.
**"It will be a long trip if you continue to talk as you do…" he adds in reply to Vancero's final words.**

## Re: CIS - Chapter One: Perdurance

### **Alicia** (2011-05-12 20:32:11)

Ketanna shakes her head. “**I won’t need a map, thank you. The wilderness is relatively mild where we’re going, but it’s still difficult for even hovercraft to make a way through the numerous dense brush some as tall as trees.**” She nods to the Trandoshan as he reappears, taking note of his armor.
“**It will be made even longer if we don’t even leave,**” she says, giving a taste of her first smile exposing pointed canines. Hoisting her back onto one shoulder over her cloak she doesn’t give much warning as she turns and leaves.
Making their way down the hall at ground level toward the garage, the facility not being very large it doesn’t take long, the group finds a transport piloted by a droid waiting for them. The garage itself has only a few speeders, but mostly there’s troop transports used to carry massive amounts of troops or even cargo.
Once aboard, the speeder moves quickly along a pre-designated course to take them to the outskirts of the capital city Tirahnn. Out of the small viewports, the towering skyscrapers and wide, broad bazaars can be seen throughout the city. The Separatist invasion has done little to stop the bazaars from operating, although the populace does seem a bit subdued. The signs of the Confederacy presence can be felt everywhere. Droid squads march down the streets, the glinting diode eyes of droidekas watch for signs of dissent from rooftops, and droid starfighters zoom overhead with the whine of repulsors. At first glance, it seems as though the city is heavily occupied, if not repressed.
Most of the inhabitants of Tirahnn seem to be going about their business as usual. Ketanna gives a small frown as she looks out her closest viewport, but otherwise keeps her thoughts to herself.

**"Stress? Stress is an illusion, an excuse. Stress is your body telling you that your priorities aren't in order. Civilization gave birth to stress. In the wild, there is none,"** Umdrow tells the human as they leave.
Umdrow spends his time studying the map and noting landmarks and orienting himself. He had no doubts about being able to survive, but knowing a direction was useless unless one knew what was in that direction. He ignores the city for the most part, other than pausing from time to time to marvel at the odd beast that is society. Once he is certain of his location and their destination he turns to the Trandoshan, **"Do you have a datapad? And what are you called?"** he then includes the rest with his glance, **"I am known as Umdrow Guuhan."**

## Re: CIS - Chapter One: Perdurance

### **hayabusa** (2011-05-13 21:17:46)

**"Mursst,"** the Trandoshan replies to Umdrow's question. He looks over the subjugated city as their speeder passes through it, thinking that all of the attention is slightly extreme, but not thinking too down upon it. He shows Umdrow his datapad and then begins to run a program on it. Those close to the Trandoshan notice that he's overlooking from-orbit images of the planet.

### **Magical2099** (2011-05-14 09:49:14)

**"Here,"** Umdrow replies, passing Mursst the datacard with the map. **"I've heard the hunting on your planet is superb. Are the rumors true?"** he asks, curious not about the hunting but about how the being answers. He takes pains to lower his voice, knowing the stereo bass rumble can cause confusion in small confined spaces. Done with his datapad, he tucks it away and sits back, wrapping his color-shifting cloak about him.

"Hmph…..people who think stuff like that are usually the first to go. And i am pretty sure that being chased by some massive beast who thinks you look like a three course meal would put a little stress in you." 
Vancero settles back and shuts his eyes. *Once again, I'm stuck with the "no nonsense" racket. I suppose they consider these attempts at boring me into submission as a good thing.*  He takes a deep breath. *Have to keep my batteries charged. Haven't been feeling 100% since I got to this hole.*. He began to unconsciously fiddle with his coat button, a familiar feeling in an increasingly unfamiliar place.

**"A little stress, yes,"** Mursst says with his mouth hanging open, showing his teeth. It may be the Trandoshan equivalent of a smile. **"But the *fun* kind."** He looks at Vancero as the man sits back and begins to play with one of the buttons on his coat, the Trandoshan thinking that he isn't taking such a mission seriously.

### **Vermillion** (2011-05-24 19:11:55)

"Yeah, well it's not so fun when the 'stress' catches you and ends up using your bones as toothpicks." Vancero slowly opened his eyes, and craned his neck to look out of the craft. "How much longer do we have to go anyway?" he sighed. "They are gonna be dead from old age at this rate."

As if the droid pilot heard the young noble’s complaints the speeder suddenly stops and the hatch to the outside opens. “**It would seem we’ve arrived,**” Ketanna says with teasing smile at Vancero as she disembarks. The speeder has stopped in the no man’s land, a half a kilometer of cleared land between the woods on the other side and the city behind. Tightening the straps on her field kit and adjusting the folds of her cloak, the young woman looks at her companions before proceeding towards the forest.
Ahead the forest looms, the trees making the distance susceptibly shorter as the height of trees is fully discerned. The trees rivaled that of Kashyyk and as you get closer it’s easy to see Ketanna hadn’t been exaggerating when she had said there was brush which almost matches the trees in size. “**Look for a way in. There might be a path we can take,**” she calls out as she makes her way down the line of trees.

Mursst nods to the droid driver as he steps out of the speeder, grabbing the datapad he had out and placing it in a pocket before stepping away from the vehicle. As Ketenna calls attention to the trees, the Trandoshan views them as well. *"Somewhat familiar to the hunting moon…"* he thinks as he walks towards the forest with the rest of the team.
Though doubful about its effectiveness with the size of the brush, Mursst removes his vibroblade and activates it to form a makeshift machete as he walks the boundary.

*So the brute will not speak. So be it,* Umdrow thinks as he exits the vehicle and sinks his bare toes into the grass and soil, searching through the Force for the soul of the place.
*He may not speak, but he can listen. Let us see if common sense is with him,* he thinks as Murrst draws his blade. **"Hold Trandoshan. Your blade will leave an easy trail, and also there is the noise to consider. Nature can guide us easily,"** he says as he gestures towards the wall-like flora, entreating it to allow entry to his companions.

On the other side of some brush Mursst happens to spot a natural path. As he goes to cut his way to it, the brush suddenly diminishes, moving to the side seemingly of its own violition. Seeing that the two had found a way in, Ketanna approaches with a look of approval on her expression. Motioning toward Vancero to hurry up and join them she follows the Trandoshan and Ithorian onto the path. Looking up and down the path she bends over to look at the various tracks.
"**Looks like we're the only sentients to use this path,**" she starts, standing up again squinting to get a look further on to see if it continues in the direction the group needs to travel.

Mursst looks at the moving brush with a slight hint of amazement before deactivating the vibroblade and sheathing it behind his back. The Trandoshan takes a few steps in, hearing undergrowth give slightly to his boots. He looks through the trees, trying to see anything unusual or threatening in the distance; or perhaps something helpful.

Vancero stretched and checked his gear again, and fell in step behind Ketanna. The resulting and creaking from the trees' movement sent a shiver up his spine. "That just seems so…unnatural," he mumbled. His spirits perked up considerably once they were on the path, and his view of Ketanna (and company) was less obscured. taking in the sights and sounds of the area, he searched his mind for context, eager to demonstrate to these so-called professionals that he was not lacking in experience himself.

Setting down the path, the traveling isn’t hard but still it’s slow. With the majority of the brush out of the way there’s only the periodic small growths have to be cut away or using Umdrow’s abilities cast aside. At one point Vancero thinking he spots a parallel path steps off his own only to get stuck in the midst of a dense brush on the other side. After helping to cut him out, Ketanna seems to keep a closer watch on him, making sure he doesn't stray from the path they have chosen.
Otherwise, the path thankfully seems to be devoid of sentient life, the only creatures making note of the group’s passage are various small creatures. After a few kilometers and an hour of travel, the direction of the path changes, no longer heading in the northwesterly direction to the village instead it veers to the east. Checking your coordinates, you are still about four kilometers from the village.
During this time, Ketanna walks on in silence not conversing unless drawn in near the rear of the group, deciding to watch her fellows’ back as they hike. Her head turns this way and that as she keeps a look out. As the group disturbs the hiding place of a group of fowl, one of her discblades comes quickly to hand as if summoned there and in a single motion it’s in the air, just missing Vancero’s head. An audible thud sounds just as the blade returns to her hand and with a pleased smile she goes to seek out where her kill had fallen.

Mursst quickly turns around when the avian hits the ground, not aware that Ketenna has chosen this time to engage in a little hunting. He shakes his head as she goes to retrieve her kill. Now was not the time, he thinks as he continues along the way.
The Trandoshan walks behind Umdrow, watching the Ithorian's strange ways as he continues. He's never seen someone use the Force before, and thinks that being's ways of making the stubborn plants just move out of the way is strange.

Umdrow sees the beast fall from the sky, and sees Ketanna's grin as she gives chase. **"As good a place as any to eat and regroup,"** he says as he begins searching the forest floor. His lack of familiarity with the planet would prevent him building a fire were it not for his vast knowledge of botany. He examines the dead vegetation, picking out the pieces and bits that will give little smoke but enough heat to cook flesh. Once he has collected enough he builds a makeshift cookpit, and ignites the flames with his saber, the blade a deep, rich brown.
**"We have four clicks to cover to the village, and roughly seven from here to the clearing,"** Umdrow says, modulating and controlling his deep voice, allowing it to only carry as far as his allies ears.

Umdrow manages to find a selection of suitable dry, dead wood to make a nearly smokeless fire from still standing trees and a good amount of kindling suitable for the task. Ketanna returns bearing an overly large bird and a couple sticks for a spit, sitting down next to the fire she begins the process of plucking and preparing it for a meal. "Come now Mursst, we'll be tired if we hike all day. At least this way we can enjoy a good meal and have the advantage of darkness when we reach the village." After pulling out a large handful of the feathers and putting them in the bottom of the fire pit she says, "**Don't know about the rest of you, but I was getting tired of those rations they serve us.**"

He gives a slight laugh. **"And yes, the rations are horrible, as they tend to be. Also in my case, not entirely adequate."** He eyes the roasting bird hungrily.

"Hmph, showoffs." Vancero looks around a bit more, trying to figure how he could have missed such a thing. "Still nice to know the lady has skill equal to her beauty." He plops down in a vacant spot with the others and awaits the feast Ketanna has provided. "So, I don't know about you guys, but I am kind of wondering why we, and the Republic, are even here. Sure it has a great view, but does anyone really find anything really….strategic about this place?" He looks around at the group again. "Then again, you don't strike me as the type that question orders."

**"Nothing to question. This planet lies on the Perlemian Trade Route, and is an above average staging area. By holding it we deny the Republic resources and grant ourselves a place to strike from. The Republic is far to dependent on their bulky and varied supplies, so we would be here even if it were not a decent staging area,"** Umdrow speaks as he studies the forest around him. He plucks a rather ugly flower-bulb and hefts it in his palm for the others to see. **"Unbeknownst to the Republic, this planet has other natural resources they could capitalize on. This, for instance,"** he says with a nod to his hand, **"Contains a potent toxin, and if administered properly, can be a powerful anesthetic. Thankfully, they rarely have the opportunity to discover such things. We keep them far too busy struggling to bring resources reliably from across the galaxy."** He turns and tosses the bulb off deep into the undergrowth, **"And we have no need for such, what with our dead armies,"** he finishes as he sits cross legged a couple meters from the fire, facing his companions. Judging by his tone on the last line of his speech he has grown bored of the topic.

Ketanna gives Vancero an impish grin at the mention of her skill comparing to her beauty, "**Pray you don't have the full extent of the former directed toward you,**" is her only comment on the matter as she turns the roasting fowl over the fire, allowing each side to cook evenly. The fowl takes some time to cook, but by the time it's ready the smell is making everyone's mouth water. Pulling it out of the fire, she pulls out her silvery diskblades, using the edges to cut off strips of flesh hading out the hot meal on large green leaves she had found to those gathered around her.
"**How is it you came to be here, Vancero,**" she asks between bites. "**The mercenary' life does not seem to be fitting.**"Taking bites of her own serving she cuts off the rest of the flesh, separating the bones and cooked flesh into piles. Eating her fill she wraps up the uneaten meat in the leaves and stores it in her field kit.

Mursst thankfully accepts his portion of the meal and downs it quickly, not caring for conversation at the moment. **"A little too done,"** is his only comment afterwards.
He turns his attention Umdrow. **"Agreed. With the only ones in the Confederacy fighting force that needs to eat being mercenaries like us or senior officers, any resource area is an even greater victory. We should strike Agamar again…"** he adds.

Kentanna gives Mursst a harsh look, her displeasure evident as she stands, gathering her gear. "**What purpose would striking a devastated member planet serve?**" She didn't wait for an answer as she finished packing and started to cover the fire in soil, distinguishing it's flames. "**We should resume. There's a way to go before darkness descends.**" Hitching on her field kit, she doesn't wait for the others as she sets her foot onto the path.

He steps quickly, moving forward and tracking their location, keeping them oriented towards the village. He continues to examine the local flora as he goes, looking for anything of interest.

With Ketanna in the led she sets a grueling pace, her frustrated anger over Mursst's comment on Agamar driving her forward.

Ketanna steps out of the way, her anger forgotten as the surprising hole takes up the foremost of her attention. She waits patiently for the two to finish their analysis, staying out of their way as best she can. Umdrow discovers signs that a large creature of some sort had been by here, though the tracks have been distorted by the travels of various other fuana using this same path. There's also signs you aren't the first sentients to come this way as evident by the prints of booted feet.
As Mursst takes a look through the hole, he can see that the hedge is thick and he also recognizes signs that this was cut with a man made weapon.

Master Dooku wouldn't be this pathetic. He would have solved this whole thing in the time it took to get here, and have a nice drink while waiting for us to catch up.** He looked at the rest of the group as they pondered the new path. **I cannot let such things get the best of me, especially not in company like this.**

**"Hmmm…"** Umdrow murmurs at the Trandoshan's pointing out of the tool marks. **"It wasn't man-made, but it was maintained and enlarged by them. A large creature burrowed it to begin with, but the traffic of smaller animals and booted feet make it impossible to tell what,"** he tells the group.
**"We have roughly three clicks left to reach the village,"** he replies to Mursst's question. **"When we are ready to proceed I will lead. Stealth may be important from here on."**

### **Alicia** (2011-06-24 13:31:53)

“**More like a klick and a half,**” she says with a shrug stepping forward past Mursst to take a look through the tunnel herself. Glancing back at Umdrow she nods her agreement. “**Wouldn’t hurt to be cautious. We don’t know if they’ve set up a watch after all.** ”
The growth of the bush makes it hard to determine how long it’s actually been there, but that fact it continues to go all the way through indicates it has been maintained and not used just by animals.
Crouching down it takes some maneuvering for those with a broad frame, but eventually the small team makes it through. The path on the other side continues where the other had left off provided it hadn’t been blocked by the wall of brush. While not well used by sentients, the signs of booted feet are more prevalent on this side of the brush even to Vancero’s untrained eye.

Heading off on their own, it takes a while for the two to circle around to a point where they won’t be easily spotted by those in the settlement.

Heaving a sigh of agreement the young woman takes her own seat on a fallen log. Ketanna is apparently discontent to sit idly as she pulls out her discblade and begins to twirl the silverplated weapon dangerously. Her eyes dart around the perimeter of the small clearing they had claimed.
Vancero receives an image of the clearing they had departed and its current occupants mid-way to the rendezvous, his feelings that Ketanna and Umdrow returned before them confirmed by the touch through the Force. Finally, after having to navigate through a dense brush which had been avoided on the trek there, the two erstwhile compatriots return.
Ketanna's gaze turns directly to the two as they enter the clearing, her discblade held ready to be thrown in one hand as she watches them. There's a dangerous glint in her hazel eyes, which remains as she stands and the discblades disappear within the depths of her cloak. "**What happened to remaining here?**" she asks coldly, then with a wave of her hand she turns to Umdrow. "**Let's share what we learned and move on.

He loosens up slightly as the discblades are replaced in her robe, and he shoulders the rifle he had in his hands. **We…** he pauses as Ketanna ignores her own first question before replying to the second one. **"We found another entrance to the camp–as I thought our original plan was,"** he states, not able to resist the slight jab. **'There's a barracks at the perimeter of the village, and about 16 troops in there from what I was able to see. They have two pair of pickets that likely switch shifts at standard times. The barracks is also relatively free of civilians. I'm sure you already know that, though."**

**"Enough,"** Umdrow says calmly, unfolding his lanky form as he rises to his full height. He pulls his cloak around him, its colors shifting constantly, **"No harm has come. We have a mission to complete. Let us be on our way,"** he finishes as he moves on ahead, towards the clearing that was their secondary objective. *Foolish, but pointing that out will be detrimental. Allow them to fail and they will learn or die. Thus is the will of the Force,* he thinks as he moves past Ketanna and Mursst, meeting the first's eyes and overlooking the second. He ignores Vancero, believing he has the human pegged as the kind who cannot stand to be ignored, who craves attention, no matter the type.

Mursst notices the slight given to him by Umdrow but doesn't say anything, preferring to just let the anger within him simmer down to nothing rather than let it hurt the mission with an outburst now. **"And did you two spot anything different?"** he says to both the Ithorian and Ketanna as he follows Umdrow towards the clearing.

**"Twenty soldiers, one barracks and regular patrols consisting of two sets of two, yes. A very minor garrison. Once we've found what we are to find in this clearing and reported they may well task us with removing them,"** Umdrow says as he leads the way along a fresh path, avoiding the obvious routes. **"A waste of our talents, but more efficient than sending out another battle group for so small a target. Ketanna, what did the pompous bureaucrat who gave our orders say about reporting? I do not recall any instructions, I assume he gave them before my arrival."**

Taking up the rear as you move through the dense forest, Ketanna calls up loud enough to be heard, but hopefully not loud enough for the sound to carry. “**We were ordered to keep comm silence till the mission was complete and we were out of range of the targets. Command doesn’t want them intercepting any messages which may give the operation away.**” The young woman glances back behind, frowning.
As you move through the undergrowth, the sounds of nature are suddenly replaced by the cacophony of blaster fire and blinding flashes from the trees up ahead. The shots ring out with precision aiming for Murrst and Umdrow, but as evident by the blaster scoring on a nearby tree, the shots obviously missed their targets. In the darkness it’s hard to discern where exactly in the trees ahead the shots came from.

Everyone failed their initial perception checks and so the ambusher(s) got off a surprise round.
The area is composed of dense foliage and undergrowth. An area not clearly designated as a path (brown patches) on the map is considered to be difficult terrain. In addition, trees, whether felled or standing, provide readily available cover and the undergrowth can be used as concealment when prone.

**"Ah, son of a murglak…"** Mursst curses as the blaster fire can be heard and races towards the nearby fallen tree. He runs as fast as he can towards it, hoping that a blaster bolt doesn't find him as he makes his way. At the last meter, he slides beside the tree and takes cover behind it.
*So much for not being found…*, the Trandoshan thinks.

As more shots ring out, still aiming for their adversary in the lead, Umdrow manages to duck behind a tree in time to avoid another pair of shots. This time, however, he's ready and manages to spot the two ambushers ahead. Spreading out in the dense foilage, Murrst, Ketanna and Vancero manage to avoid any other attention. His sight obscured by trees and the darkness, Vancero is unable to see any of their adversaries hiding within the dense foliage.

Mursst remains in his cover, but risks sticking his head out for a quick look to the east, where the blaster fire is coming from. He motions for the others to come where he is and share the cover. If he sees one of their attackers, he fires a shot at him or her.

Calmly watching the blaster bolts fly past him, Umdrow decides to play his role as target. He reaches out to Vancero in the Force, sending him an image of ferocious Akk battle dogs swarming from the shadows to overwhelm distracted prey. Hoping the young Force sensitive understands and can relay the message to their allies Umdrow ignites his Great Saber with its audible *snap-hiss* and over-sized, deep hunter green blade glowing in the low light, carried lazily at his side, angled towards his opponents and the ground. He stands at his full height, letting his color-shifting cloak fall open, and begins to stalk directly towards the two ambushers firing on him. Between the noise, glow, and sheer size of his blade and his own towering stature and certainty of success that shows in his bearing, he should have no issue holding the attention of their attackers.

Vancero is startled by the sudden intrusion into his mind, but the flashing image of the beasts and the sense of warning attached ends any consideration. He passes along the information through the Force to Ketanna and moves forward, matching Umdrow's movement with his own more circuitous path. As he gets closer, he draws his saber, but does not ignite it, fearing the light and sound may give him away too early.
