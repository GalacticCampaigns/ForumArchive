# [After Effects] Chapter One

[hide]Planetary body Scan commencingâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.
Planet identifiedâ€¦â€¦.

Nar Shaddaa
Region: Mid Rim
Climate: Temperate (urban)
Gravity: Standard
Sapient Species: 20% Human, 1% Evocii, 79% Other Species
â€œNar Shadda!â€ Fenn shouted. â€œItâ€™s Nal Huttaâ€™s moon.â€ He flips a few switches. â€œLooks like sheâ€™s only got enough juice to get us there.â€ The ship goes thru another violent shudder from the continued assault of the Clone trooper Cruiser and Fenn swears under his breath. Even by Bothan standards he was short but his size didnâ€™t stop him from being one of the best pilots in the Republic. It was a testament of his skill that he managed to get the ship this far.
â€œI can get you guys in, but your on your own after that.â€ He stated as he started evasive maneuvers, pointing the nose of the ship toward the planet. â€œHereâ€™s where things get a little bumpy, weâ€˜re going in hot and fast.â€ He chuckled. The ship accelerated toward the planet, zigzagging in and out of the cruisers laser fire.
Fenn guided the ship into the planets atmosphere. The friction of reentry causing the exterior of the ship to glow as the hull became superheated. Alarms sounded as the structural integrity became more and more unstable. A lucky shot from the cruiser managed to hit the ship on its port side. The resulting blast temporarily deafening everyone and causing the breathable air to be ripped from the cabin with a horrible sucking sound.
Immediate weightlessness caused various loose items in the cabin to begin floating and time seemed to stand still. It lasted only a microsecond, and in an instant gravity returned, items fell to the floor and breathable air rushed back in. Gravity seemed to increase ten fold as the ship gathered speed. The world below growing ever larger.
Fenn scanned the ships onboard computers and navigational aids, banged on the console a few times and turned to face everyone. â€œThe cruiser is taking up an orbit around the planet.â€ He said. â€œI bet my last few credits theyâ€˜ll have the local authorities waiting in mass.â€ He glanced back at the view screen and turned to take hold of the controls. â€œSeems that blast crippled us. I have minimum controls so at best Iâ€™ll get us down in one piece.â€
â€œWere a long way from the spaceport . If everything works out we should be able to get a healthy distance away from the ship before the authorities arrive.â€œ His knuckles whitened as he fought to keep the ship in the air. It was speeding by the tops of high-rises, the wake from the sublight engines shattering the duraplex windows.
Fenn fought to keep the ship under control as it touched down on a maintenance walkway that ran between two construction sites. It rocked forward on its nose, skidded to the end of the narrow walkway and tipped over the edge. The momentum carried it straight off and it looked as if Fenn would bring it under control but just as the craft leveled off it clipped a droid service corridor that set it into a spin.
Fenn attempted to correct but the damage to the ships navigational systems halted any progress he may have made. The ship sliced threw the corner of a building partially crushing the pilots cockpit, and then barreled into the ground punching a hole threw the durasteel plated flooring. The only thing visible to those witnesses on the ground level were two glowing sublight engines.
The passengers wake up several minutes after the impact to find the pilots compartment smashed flat. Fenn lay dead in the pilots seat. The rear exit is sealed between 4 feet of durasteel. But the side escape hatch opens into a room roughly 12 foot square with a metal door directly opposite the hatch. The room is bare except for what appears to be a bed roll and some rations. Though it seems the occupants are currently not at home. The escape hatch hangs about 6 feet from the floor.[/hide]

[hide]**Master Tru -** 
Jace Bows towards the mangled corpse and whispers"You have my thanks Fenn, you have become one with the force" Jace also reflects on anyother passengers who may not have made it.
Turning to Ganthos Vann, Jake Golan, Sorka, and Mel Doon
((Out of Game do we even know each other)) " are you all ok?"
Waits for answers helps out if he can then says "we should leave this craft as soon as possible those rations may serve us"
Once outside Jace scans the area for anyone hurt by the crash.
"Fenn said Nar Shadda has anyone ever been to this Nar Shadda before or know anything about it?" Jace says as he turns back to the group.
"Nar Shadda, otherwise known as the Smugglers Moon. Will be a good place to hide for a while. Enough low life's here we can either find what we need to survive or end up with a vibro blade in our backs."
Nods and agrees with the others.
"We should get moving....the local authorities will probably be around soon....that or troopers..."
**Yogi -** 
Jake came around and had a small bump on his head. Sitting up he rubbed the sore spot and looked at his hand to make sure that he wasn't bleeding. Seeing no blood he put a hand down, a foot under him and stood up. A quick look over of his person yielded no more injuries other than bumps and bruises.
He listens to the others as they talk. Having not known them very long he isn't sure how that will react to the situation. He listened with satisfaction as this planet will serve well to hide them for the time being and they know that.
Jake walked to the dead pilot. Looking at the Jedi named Jace he nodes his head. "I'm fine. You?" He went through the pilots clothes to see if he had anything of value or something that would identify him. He took what he could find as the dead have no use for possessions.
(OOC: What does he find from searching his body)
Standing up he checked that his blaster was ready for quick use. satisfied that it was he stood next to the others. They had the right idea. Get off the ship and find some place to hold up in.
"Lets find someplace to bunk down and get our bearings. One thing is for sure we will need another ship to get off this rock and that wont come cheap."
He went and grabbed his holdall that contained all of his belongings. In it was what tied him to his past. One he still knew little of.
"Make sure to grab what you want I doubt we will be able to come back here." He was ready to go. Staying on the ship would only lead to trouble.
**Anji -** 
Mel Doon stood and brushed off his combat suit. The Kel Dor would have smiled, if that was a possibility for their species.
"Nar Shadda, is indeed known as the smugglers moon, a place so filled with hatred, lies and deceit, that we shouldn't have to venture far to find somebody in aid, or somebody wishing to aid us against the Sith"
Mel Doon finished gathering his many belongings that had scattered around the ship and placed them on his person. He then placed on a more fitting robe, over his combat suit, something to make his noble blood seem a bit more...noticeable.
"My father died here, on Nar Shadda, trying to track down my mother, I believe fate guided the beam that struck us so that I may find some answers...how ever the wellness of this team shall not be jeopardized by my own past."
Mel Doon looked around at his comrades. "May I suggest we find the nearest town, I will see if I can pull any strings to find out some information, I'll see if there is a safe heaven for us on this island of vermin, and perhapse we will encounter a few worthy to aid us."
Mel Doon hoped that his noble words would influence the others, he very much wished to explore Nar Shadda and uncover the mystery of just what had happened.
**Rowen -** 
Everyone managed to get down from the ship without incident. The room you exited the ship into was small. Upon further investigation you see that the bedroll has been used recently but the rations laying around were severly outdated.
The door just oppisite the escape hatch opens as you approach but you can tell it is in bad need of repair. The hall just beyond is clear and branches into 2 directions. You hear the sound of foot steps coming from the right side, but they dont sound normal. More like something metalic thumping the flooring. You can tell its getting closer.
((Yogi you find a medpac and a credit chip worth 34 credits from Fenn's body))
**Jace -**
Jace scans the area, takes a moment to listen trying to determine if the sound is a threat or not. "Ganthos you apear on edge, stay alert but do not give into fear."
With that Jace places a hand on the hilt of his saber. Given to him by his master the dull metalic iteam always puts Jace at ease. Absentmindedly Jaces thoughts fall to his master and the last time they where together.
Shaken his head Jace turns to the group, "should we run or meet this face on?" looking over the shaken and torn group "I am behind any decision the group makes."
**Yogi -** 
The room the ship exited to was small. Recently used but currently unoccupied they had a small window to regroup and figure out what they were going to do.
What to do. Going to ground would be best. With five it will be harder than If I was alone. Still safety in numbers is better than being alone. Jake thought to himself.
"I was able to recover a medpac and credit chip with 34 credits on it. It isn't much but it's something. Besides Fenn won't be needing them anymore. It may seem callous but we're on our own now. Every military unit in the republic will be looking for us."
The sound of Metallic footsteps echoes from the hall. He watched Jace listen to the sounds of the coming foot steps. Jake moved to the right side of the door and listened.
"Either we move out or we stay here and see what happens. If blasters start firing others will come faster."
-----------
OOC: Rowen can I take a Perception check to figure out how many are coming?
**DarthAnthrax -**
Ganthos chuckles and gives Jace a reassuring look.
"DonÃ‚Â´t worry master Jedi, IÃ‚Â´m not that easilay startled. But after the warm welcome we received upon entering this system I wonÃ‚Â´t take any chances".
Sliding a hand into a pouch at his side, Ganthos produces a Ion grenade, weighs it in his hand, and places himself on the opposite side of the door from Jake.
"If whatever rustbucket coming our way decides to level a blaster on us, I want to be ready."
-----------
OOC: Wants to make a Perception check to determine from wich of the corridors the sound is coming, and if possible approximate distance
**Yogi -** 
Jake noticed Ganthos take up the other side of the door and heard the other mans voice. "If whatever rustbucket coming our way decides to level a blaster on us, I want to be ready." A quick look and he spotted the Ion Grenade in Ganthos's hand.
Jake smiled and nodded a he drew his own weapon, a DL-44 Heavy Blaster, a blaster no one wanted to be on the business end of. Who or whatever it was if its intent was to cause trouble, it found it.
**Sorka -** 
Sorka unhooked her light saber from her belt, keeping her thumb on the ignition.
"I'm getting tired of running....I say we stay and defend ourselves."
She readied her self as the clanking sounds got closer.
**Master Tru -** 
looking around Jace smiles, seeing that everyone is ready for anything. Thinking to himself (this gives me comfort to know that I am not alone, after being seperated from my master). Jace noods a smile at Mel Doon, Jake, Ganthos, and Sorka "may the force be with us"
With renewed confedence Jace steps out of the room, hand on his saber hilt, to meet this head on.
This being the first time Jace can remember acting without his master his voice trembles slightly at first"I am Jace who goes there? ...."
**Anji -** 
Mel Doon drew his heavy blaster and figured the others had that area covered, so he would guard the backs.
Though it killed him not to look at where the sound was omitting from, he felt this was the wisest choice given the closed space.
**DarthAnthrax -** 
Noticing the sound seems to come from the tunnel on the right, Ganthos quickly positions himself to cover that area, signaling to the others to be ready in that direction as well, as the sound draws nearer.[/hide]

### **Rowen** (2008-04-01 09:12:19)

[hide]**Rowen -**
The clanking stops at the bend in the hallway, keeping just out of site.
'Not a friendly lot are you.' The voice is definitely that of a droid, though a near perfect simulation of a human's there is a definite mechanical quality to it. "Nor particularly smart, but what can one expect of organics. I heard everything you were just saying, so don't think I'm going to let you get the drop on me.'
A pause.
'I'm not here to hurt you, so if you don't plan to pick a fight with me either why don't you come out here where I can see you?'
**Master Tru -**
Jace looks back to his friends "the force may have guided us here for a reason." placing his hand palms out and shoulder level Jace steps forward light saber in plain veiw.
Under his breath Jace states "There is no emotion: there is peace ...." taken a breath Jace steps around the corner " We have not come to fight, we will defend ourselves, but maby we could be of assistance to each other. I am Jace what is your name droid?"
Jace steps around the bend staying close to the durasteel prefab walls......
**Simplyscribed -**
The droid is humanoid and sturdily built, its frame approaching seven feet in height, and its head resembling a war-like helmet ((OOC: Think the Predator's mask)). Its long arms end in hands with fully opposable digits, which are currently clasped around a blaster carbine held at the ready.
The whole thing is painted a dull red, pocked, scratched and otherwise marked from an existence with combat as its only purpose. Tellingly, none of the damage seems more than superficial. It is equipped with the aforementioned rifle, a pistol holstered at its "waist", and some kind of pack - the nature of it cannot be determined as only the straps are apparent from the front. The serial marking one would otherwise expect to see painted on the droid has been deliberately scratched out.
Its eyes glow a brighter red, and blink on and off as Jace steps around the corner.
'A Jedi...? I wonder, what could have caused a Jedi ship to crash on the Smuggler's Moon?' It says, in a very close approximation of thoughtfulness.
'Nothing good, certainly. Yes, perhaps I can profit from this. I am Red, soldier extraordinaire. '
Red leans forward in a mock bow.
'And you are on the run from something - what I can't imagine - and need a place to lie low. Correct?'
**Master Tru -**
Jace gives a similar bow, "Red is it nice to meet you." Watching the red droid closly Jace greets the droid.
"You seam more enlightened then other droids I have meet. Are you solo or do you serve a master Red?" A little unsure if this question would offend the droid or not Jace quickly glances back to the direction of his friends.
"Any assistance you could give in the way of a place to lay low would be very welcome."
**Simplyscribed -**
'I have no master but myself.' Red responds in clipped tones.
'I will assist you,' he says, stepping to one side and gesturing with a hand for Jace to move past him, 'and I expect you will be very grateful.'
The hint is less than subtle.
**Anji -**
Mel Doon stood by Jace's side.
He thought to himself, if only we had uncounted a humonoid, I could have coned them into setting us up with the grandest home on this planet...but that time will have to wait.
Mel Doon holstered his blaster. as he learned towards Jace.
"You seem to have things under control Jedi, please let me know if I can be of assistance."
Mel Doon waited or the others to gather, and stood in the middle of them, obviously his robes gave the false sense of some kind of noble, or government official, but he also knew that on this moon, that could be attention he doesn't want.
**Master Tru -**
Jace thinking to himself (I will trust in the force, this meeting may be influenced by the force).
Jace looks back " all clear, RED seams ok and may help us." Jace cautiously takes reds invite and walks past.
"If I may ask Red, why would you give aid to strangers, the rumors of this smugglers moon are not very good."
The droids merc stance reminds Jace of the B2s that fought during the clone wars, absentmindedly his hand slips to the hilt of his saber. Realizing what he has done he quickly removes it.
**Sorka -**
Sorka calmly gathers herself and purposefully walks from the room to stand beside Jace. She gave a slight nod to Red as she passed.
"We best hurry." She glances at Jace. "I fear we don't have much time."
She then turn to face Red awaiting his response to Jace's question.
**Simplyscribed -**
Red turns his head in the direction of Mel Doon, and then Sorka, to whom he returns the nod, one of his eyes winking off and on.
'I expect there to be something in it for me.' Red replies bluntly. 'Though I am not foolish enough to negotiate terms here at the sight of your crash. Your female is correct, there will be little time left until those that follow you get here. You left them a rather visible clue as to your location.'
**Master Tru -**
"I believe your wisdom to be true Sorka, we sould make all haste." Jace continues forward not knowing fully where he is going then turns back. "Good Red perhaps you could lead the way if you know of a sutable place to lay low?"
Jace pauses in his tracks awaiting the droid to process the new information. Still a lil unuse to dealing with droid outside of combat droids and servent droids, Jace is slightly uneasy around the droid the blinking red eye isnt helping matters at all.
Thinking to himself (The droid looks capable, I hope its not malfunctioning).
**Simplyscribed -**
'Certainly.' The droid replies. 'As soon as your other companion shows himself, I will lead you there.'
**Darthanthrax -**
Making the assesment that the droid menas them no harm, Ganthos replaces his grenade in his pocket and steps forward to join Jace, Sorka, Mel and RED.
"Well this was a nice surprise, I was kind of expecting a fight here. Glad not all residents of this system wants to shoot us on sight".
Whispering in a low voice to the rest of the crash survivors, Ganthos added:
"And if he starts to misbehave, we can always hotwire him to be a portable refresher".
**Simplyscribed -**
'My price just went up, organic.' Red comments calmly.
**Yogi -**
Jake stayed behind the door just in case the droid named "Red" was trying to lure the group in to a sense of false security. Getting a sense that it's intentions were to actually help and not blast them. He stepped out of the doorway and holstered his blaster as Ganthos spoke in a low voice which was only meant for the group to hear. Apparently Red heard it also.
"My price just went up, organic." Its voice sounded out. To Jake it sounded like it was very offended.
He decided to step in and try to smooth it over.
"Red please forgive my comrades attempt at humor. At another place and time it may have been humorous but at this stage it isn't especially when others who may not be as cooperative as you have been with us. Perhaps we all can get moving?"
In all actually Jake did find the comment funny and as he walked up to Ganthos he laid a hand on his shoulder and looked at his comrade and gave him a wink that the driod coundn't see.
**Simplyscribed -** 
'My humour circuits must have burned out.' Red replies impassively. 'Would it have been a joke if instead of meeting me you had encountered an organic and your friend suggested giving them a lobotomy?'
He turns and stalks off down the corridor.[/hide]

### **Rowen** (2008-04-01 09:19:59)

[hide]**Anji -**
Mel Doon stood and looked at his comrades.
"Well then...that was interesting, so what is our plan now? We should probably secure a new ship and pilot so we can continue our journey."
**Rowen -**
With everyone now assembled they follow Red to the upper level of the city. Once outside the damage there ship had caused was staggering. A trail of shattered duraplex lined the streets, heads could be seen looking out of the recently destroyed windows. Smoke plumed from the missing corner of a high rise building, chunks of which were scattered about the street. The debris made a highly visible trail to two smoldering hunks of metal that used to be the ships sublight engines.
Casual observers were beginning to gather and alarms could be heard in the distance. Red quickened his pace and impatiently beckoned the group to move faster. His route was haphazard, with twists in and around buildings, behind anything that could hide the group from view, and at times even underground. After what seemed an hour of walking and back tracking their trek lead them to the undeveloped section of the city. Gone were the elegant high rises with intricate facets and designs. What loomed over head could only be described as unlivable, condemned.
It was here that Red was taking them. Here they could rest, safe from any that would be looking for them. There pace slowed and Red assured the group they were near his place of solitude. They were just rounding the final corner when Red stopped short. He motioned for the group to move back quietly and pointed to his head, indicating they should listen.
The sounds were enough to drop anyone's morale. It was the sound of a com unit and the distinct sound of a clone troopers voice.
"Sir, unit two has located the crashed ship. Looks like all but one survived. Witnesses around the crash indicated a pale red droid with a group of people following it."
**Anji -**
Mel Doon withdrew his blaster looked around for a decent place to hide.
"I believe our best choice is to ambush him, unless you think I could try to convince him to aid us."
**Master Tru -**
"Action against a single trooper might only bring in more troopers and alert them to our whereabouts." Jace rubs his chin, still not use to the
shadow that has grown. " Also I have never known troopers to search alone there will be more out there.We need more information, Sorka perhaps
you could assist me." Jace sits down legs crossed, closes his eyes .....
Jace takes a 10 on Use force, Sense Surroundings to try and determine the number of troopers in the imediate area.
**Simplyscribed -**
Red glances at Jace. Turning his audio output to the lowest possible volume, he murmurs: 'Sitting down when danger threatens? Very helpful.'
The droid looks for a doorway into one of the surrounding buildings that can be accessed without moving into the open, then attempts to gain entry.
**Darthanthrax -**
Ganthos unholsters his blaster, readies it for action and looks around for some cover.
"YouÃ‚Â´ll be surprised what a Jedi can do, Red"
Ganthos closes his eyes, trying to summon to him a mental picture of the surroundings and the whereabouts of his opponents, like he has done so many times before.
-------------------
If any cover is availible, Ganthos takes position behind it. He also uses a combination of Sense Surroundings and Perception to determine the location and number of the troopers, taking 10 if possible on both checks
**Simplyscribed -**
'Whatever he's doing, he could do it on his feet.' Red retorts, unmoved by Ganthos' assertion.
**Master Tru -**
Jace ignores the droids comments, his mind almost leaves the mortal shell which incases his luminous being. Streching out with his fellings, Jaces put all his focus on his current task.
The minds of Sorka come into veiw first bright and shining, to the untrained sitting this close one would mistake her for a powerful jedi master not a padawon learner as himself. Next Ganthos Vann comes into view though not as bright, Ganthos could have been a jedi had the council found him at a young age. Jake Golan and Mel Doon can be felt as well, like a faint candel against a universal backdrop. Even the droid Red can be sensed, though with a light all its own, Jace buts his friends behind him and reaches outward toward the clone trooper.
**Sorka -**
Sorka gives Red an admonishing glance as she quickly sits in front of Jace.
"Concentration is paramount....but don't worry Red we can be on our feet faster than you think...."
Closing her eyes she opens herself up to the force allowing it to flow thru her and to Jace giving him a gentle nudge of encouragement thru the force.
**Rowen -**
Jace and Sorka sit and combine both their skills, reaching out with the force simultaneously. With there combined force powers helping and pushing each other they were able to sense the clone trooper they heard speaking. Further use of there skill pushed past the lone trooper to reveal another close by. The building which lay beyond was empty, just as Red had indicated. No other troopers could be sensed around their location.
While the two Jedi were in there meditation Red was quietly testing doors, none of which would allow access, at least not with out a considerable amount of noise.
**Yogi -**
Jake stood there in astonishment as Jace sat down to meditate. Jake shook his head and drew his blaster. He's kriffing sitting down. What's next taking a nap. Jake thought to himself as he watched wondering what can happen next.
His thought was answered when Sorka defended Jace to Red. "Concentration is paramount....but don't worry Red we can be on our feet faster than you think...." And she sat down with him. Jake figured helping him in some way. What was the sense of having the abilities of a Jedi if you had to sit down all the time to use them.
He spoke up. "Maybe so, but shouldn't you be able to concentrate on your feet by now." He looked at the droid and shrugged and took in his surroundings looking for any sign that they have been discovered.
**Simplyscribed -**
Having no luck with the nearby doors, Red returns to the group.
'Well?' He asks in a tone of mild impatience.
**Master Tru -**
Sensing Jakes impatience Jace begins to make low snoring sounds, a slight smile curves Jaces lips. In a single move Jace rises to his feet (takes a 10 on acrobatics to stand from a prone position in a swift move).
"Well .... there are two troopers beyond, if we dispose of them we should do so quickly and if possible quitly .... can anyone bypass this door without raising the alarm?" Jace whispers to the group.
**Simplyscribed -** 
'If you "dispose" of them, their allies will swarm the area soon enough, making it ill suited as a place to lie low.' Red states. 'We must find a way past them.'
**Master Tru -**
"I am open to sugestions, what do you rest of you think?"
Jace turns back to the others, looking at the group Jace thinks to himself. we all need answer, what is going on, our .... my whole world has been turned upside down and inside out.[/hide]

## Re: After Effects - Chapter One

### **Rowen** (2008-04-01 09:41:57)

[hide]**Darthanthrax -**
Hearing the discussion of the others, Ganthos seraches his mind to find some solution to the situation. He thinks back to the various times back in CorSec when he worked with Jedi.
"Hey Jace, Sorka." He says quietly. "CanÃ‚Â´t you mess around a little with their minds, thinking they never saw us? Or use the Force to disable them or something?" Ganthos then makes a resigned sigh and mutters under his breath: "I should have stayed on Corellia."
Ganthos shoots a look to se if the troopers have come their way yet and then moves next to Red to examine the door.
**Anji -**
Mel Doon stepped forward.
"If everybody will consent to it I will simply ask them to allow us to pass, and if we can hide the Jedi I see no reason this plan will not work...you will find I can be rather...influential when the time comes for it."
Mel Doon pauses and looks around.
"However I will leave that choice to you, my comrades."
**Simplyscribed -**
Red turns to the two Jedi, holding out a hand.
'Give me your lightsabers. Based on their size I would say I can conceal them both.'
**Master Tru -**
"Well Mel Doon there is wisdom in your words, we will stand ready in case they fail. But I believe in your abilities, may the force be with you."
Jace turns to Red sizing up the the droid for a moment. "I will pass over my saber to you, but how fast can you return it if the need should arive?"
**Simplyscribed -**
'I will calculate the necessary time expenditure.' Red replies.
'Within six seconds. If you stay nearby, you can take them from my hands as soon as they are retrieved.'
**Sorka -** 
Sorka slowly unhooks her saber and looks at it. She listens quietly to the exchange between Jace and Mel Doon. She had not parted with her weapon since her master gave it to her.
"If you think its safe Jace then I will give Red my saber for safe keeping." she narrowed her eyes at Red. "But know this....if you are leading us into a trap you won't know your power converters from your drive systems when I get through with you..."
She glanced at Jace again and waited to see if he agreed as well to give up his saber.
**Master Tru -**
"To a jedi there are no attachments, to a jedi there are no posesions ..... these are dark times to Soka and myself these iteams are all we have left of a much better time, remember that when safekeeping them Red"
Jace slowly passes the saber over noods to Sorka and then stands ready behind Red.
**Simplyscribed -**
Red tuts as he takes the weapons, while a panel in his chest slides aside to reveal internal storage.
'Such a lack of trust for a Jedi is tragic.' He comments wryly. 'Do not worry, I am a droid of my word. So long as I am recompensed, you are safe.'
The droid places the lightsabers within his chest chassis and closes it.
'And all you need do to keep them safe is to keep me safe. Simple, no?'
**Sorka -** 
Sorka hands over her saber to Red.
"The greatest trust we had was broken when one of our own turned on us...."
Sorka choked on the words as she took position behind Red next to Jace. She closed her eyes and cleared her mind, pushing away the anger and sadness that she felt welling up inside her at the thoughts of the betrayal. Centering her thoughts on the task at hand, silently repeating the first line of their code to herself.
**Yogi -** 
Jake wasn't sure about the plan but at the moment it might be the best way. "You two are sure about this?" He said quietly to the two Jedi trainees. For that is what they were. Jake reminded himself of the way Jace sat down to use the force instead of being on his feet. With them handing over their lightsabers and give a nod he knew that they were all commited to this venture.
He kept his voice low. "All right then Ganthos and I can act as bodyguards for you two and Mel Doon" He said to the Jedi. Looking at Red he spoke to the droid. "Red no offense but can you act as their protocol droid and stay close to them allowing then quicker access to their weapons if the need arises?
**Simplyscribed -** 
'Apart from the fact that I already suggested they stay close to me, there are two rather large flaws in that plan.' Red comments, turning his head to survey Jake.
'First, most protocol droids don't have the signs of several battles marking their frames. Second, most protocol droids don't carry around any equipment, let alone weapons and a jetpack.'
'No,' he continues, 'we are on Nar Shaddaa, the crime capital of the galaxy: There is nothing necessarily suspicious about a merchant who owns his own fourth degree droid here. If we play the parts of a shady "businessman" and his entourage we will not be suspicious, precisely because we are the exact kind of suspicious that is expected on Nar Shaddaa.'
**Darthanthrax -**
Ganthos listened to the plan and nodded his agreement.
"I think it sounds like a solid plan. And like the driod said, here on the SmugglerÂ´s Moon, a merchant with a pair of bodyguards and a 4th-dergee driod shouldnÂ´t be such an odd sight"
Ganthos looked over at Mel Doon.
"DonÂ´t worry, the moment we see heÂ´s not falling for your bluff, heÂ´s a goner"
Ganthos looked back on the others with a concerning look on his face.
"ThereÂ´s one thing though. After the way they treated us on the way in, I have no particular fondness for the clone troopers here, but in order to keep as low a profile as possible perhaps we should avoid killing any."
Looking at the others for response, he puts a finger on the switch between "stun" and "lethal" mode on his blaster.
-----------------------------
OOC: Switching weapon modes is a swift action, right?

Mel Doon looked to his comrades and nodded.
"I need two of you to stand in the background, in plain site where the troopers may see you."
Mel Doon took a deep breath through his ventilated breather and began his walk towards the troopers.
"Trooper!" He bellowed as loud as he could. The troopers turned his gun on him.
"My name is Nem Morn. I am the ambassador's of Dorin, the Kel Dor home world. I come here on diplomatic grounds however my servants and I have lost our way and I require your guidance on behalf of the loyal planet of Dorin."
Mel Doon stood a solid 10 feet from the trooper, after he had advanced slowly, his prestige robe flowed around him while his arms sat cracled in each hand he looked at the trooper to see his move.

Ganthos watched the progress of Mel Doon and had to say ha was a little impressed at how the Kel Dor handled the troopers. Nevertheless, he wasnÃ‚Â´t going to be caught off guard and so he scanned the troopers closely for any sign of hostile action.
