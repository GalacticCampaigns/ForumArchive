# [Reality Bytes] Hack (H-311's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-01 16:07:56)

Order 66 meant a fundamental change in galactic life. Heroes became villains and lackeys ascended to power overnight. The future of the Jedi order seemed bleak, if not completely non-existant. Republic rule was overturned and a growing Imperial presence was felt on every known world. Emperor Palpatine was a beacon of hope and prosperity to many citizens, but some were naturally (and secretly) suspicious. Armor-clad Stormtroopers were beginning to show up working alongside local authorities, sometimes even commandeering them for classified Imperial purposes. Order 66 affected everything.
Well, almost everything. Simpler minds saw things in a simpler light. It's hard to stay up on current events when you're buried under an entire mining facility for eight months. Finally restored to his former glory, mining droid H-311 saw nothing new. The treacherous clone troopers had changed their appearance it seemed, but he knew nothing of this "Jedi Plague" that he kept hearing about. H-311 had altered his appearance to some degree too - the once-prominent restraining bolt now absent from his chest and his behavioral inhibitors permanently disengaged. Cracking hard surfaces open to reveal hidden contents was his specialty, and where once it had been a matter of duty to dig deep below the planet's surface for rare metals, his job was now much more straight-forward. Imperial armor shatters much easier than bedrock.
The composition of Corellian soil is mostly light metals. For a seasoned miner with the right tools it would take only a few weeks to burrow a shaft two and half kilometers long. H-311 had been working at it for a little over thirty-six hours. In a matter of minutes he would be breaking through the wall of the basement level in a newly-erected Stormtrooper barracks in the center of Tyrena. He knew the building wasn't yet furnished with advanced security measures like seismic sensors, so it was a pretty safe bet no one would notice any tunneling visitors. Not that it would have mattered much to him. H-311 has grown to enjoy the screams of terror when inferior beings crumble beneath the glowing pick of his modified mining axe.<div style="text-align: center;">
That distinct joy waits for him only a meter and a half of dirt away.

Some characters are all about intrigue, suspense and emotional roller-coasters. Some characters like to hurt things. I think H-311 falls into the latter category, and my guess is that he's very good at it. I'm not going to math out what the rules would be for you to dig through a four and a half feet of dirt and wall - if you want to do it just do it in your post. If not, do something else. I'm not sure yet if I want to use a map or not, so we'll just see how it all goes. Enjoy!

H-311 stopped for a moment and glanced at the wall that now separated him from the clone troopers, no he corrected his thoughts. They now called themselves stormtroopers, not that their name mattered. Their white armor still made them stick, making them all that much easier to track down. Shortly after hearing about a set of barracks that had just been constructed he had spent the last of his credits to get smuggled into the are. After waiting for almost an entire day he finely had broken out of his disguise and got to work. As he waited he had heard some troopers talking about more of these jedi. He still wondered who these jedi were and what that had done to have this new empire come down on them. He also wanted to know if they could be useful. When it came to breaking, or killing, he had no trouble. It was he was when he wanted to try and talk to others that he ran into problems. Every one just saw him as a hulking piece of machinery.
He did one final check of his systems and raised his pickax and punched through the last bit of dirt. As light started to make it's way into the tunnel H-311 flipped on the Ion charger. While it did little to humans he still found that it affected them and he found it a bit ironic. H-311 placed his pickax on his back and placed his large claws on ether side of the large hole he had made. Using all this strength he started pushing. Servos started whining as he pushed harder. This caused his extra cooling fans to kick in, the added noise was sure to draw attention but H-311 was not know for being the stealthy type. As the wall finely crumbled under his strength H-311 stepped through and glanced around trying to get an idea of what he was in for next.

The wall resists at first, cracks forming in the permacrete but durasteel girders standing firm. In a fully-finished state the task would have been considerably more difficult. Unfortunately for the workers on that sub-level, the walls had not yet received the final fortifications. They grind away at their various workstations with all the motivation of a sleepy Hutt. The blue Imperial work uniform is functional at best and allows them all to carry smaller tools wherever they may be needed, but workteams man heavier equipment with the required amount of hearing protection. A lone technician is hunched over an open electrical panel, staring intently at its damaged conduits. The weather has not helped him stay on schedule.
The technician looks up as he notices the gravel spill past his feet and the wall crumbles to the floor. The temporary lighting spills into H-311's tunnel exit and reveals a curious - and terrifying - sight: Mechanical Death has come for him. He stands frozen in terror, and H-311 is quick to act.

Okay, so that's your basic Imperial barracks sub-level under construction. You're the green circle, the blue circles are the workers. It's a surprise round, and the other four workers are unaware of your presence. The middle section is a temporary room made with something like that semi-clear plastic that construction workers use. The red areas are difficult terrain, representing open panels and tools and such. The entrance to the bottom is a freight elevator, currently working but with the doors closed. The entrance on the far right wall is the utility stairwell, and the only functional alarm is the orange bit on the wall next to it.
I tried to do my best at keeping it simple but obvious, so I'm sure I missed something. Let me know if you have any questions. Have fun!

H-311 saw the man and tilted his head. Organic creatures we're so strange, instead of freezing up in fer the man should have do something. That was one of the things that separated him from them, useless feelings. He quickly gathered what info he could about the room before he looked back at the man. His fans picked up speed as he bolted forward. He knew his heavy metal legs would alert others as he feet stomped onto the ground. As he raced forward he realized that he would not be able to reach the man before he could react. Now he only hoped that he could still act faster than the man could react.

A silent scream escapes from the man as his feet finally get the message and he flees. Unfortunately for him, he turns and trips over himself. Now laying prone, he knows this is the end. All the commotion has piqued the curiosity of the pair of workers in the center area, and they decide to see what exactly all the noise is about.

a) I'll get an updated map up as soon as I can, but for now just eyeball it. The two workers in the plastic walled area will be headed out in the next round.
b) You won Initiative, so have fun.
c) I have absolutely zero interest in rolling anything on this site until this horrible single-digit trend subsides. That was horrible! But then, he *is* Ensign Redd... ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)
