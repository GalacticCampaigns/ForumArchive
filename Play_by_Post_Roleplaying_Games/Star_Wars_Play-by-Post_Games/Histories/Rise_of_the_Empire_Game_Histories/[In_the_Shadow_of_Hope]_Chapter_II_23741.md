# [In the Shadow of Hope] Chapter II

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-18 13:04:46)

In a few days time after the return from Viraxia, Winter and Marlena are summoned to a briefing room by captain Droga. The room is small, and contains only a round table with a holoprojector in the middle, and around it is arrayed chairs. They recognizes captain Droga, and sitting to the captains left is the captain of the ship that helped them escape Viraxia. There is also a man they donÂ´t recognizes. They donÂ´t spot Hars, Dax or even Sidnas. Droga greets them as they enters.
"Ah, good to see you again. I trust you have been able to recover from your experiences well enough. If you will take a seat, we shall get underway"

"Yes, thank you," she says, taking a seat at one of the indicated chairs. "Any word on how Harsgault is doing?"

"His condition is fine, but he will be out of commision for a while. Our medics found traces of an unknown substance in his body, one that had been breaking down his body from the inside. But it seems to have dissipated for now"

Winter looks around the room. He recizes the capt that helped them out. He sets down next Marlena. He was glad to hear the Hars would be ok for now. "Is Dax doing well also? I hope he will be able to join us on our next outting. That is what we are here about right?" Winter still had his long coat and flight cap, but he missed his blaster. The one he got from the guard was serviceable but he didn't take very good care of it.

DrogaÂ´s expression becomes a little worried.
"Actually, Dax has disappeared. We donÂ´t know when he left, but we suspect he left in company with the Jedi you rescued, Sidnas. We have our operatives keeping an eye out for them, but so far nothing"
He shifts himself and holds his hand out in a showing motion towards the unknown man sitting along the table next to him.
"This is Jade Krevell, he will be accompanying you on this mission"

Jade leaned forward from his sitting position and waved his hand in a sort of greeting.  "Hey just call me Jade."  He said as he then leant back into his chair and motioned to the captain in a conitue gesture.

"I am Winter. Glad to have you aboard. Ashame  about Dax. I hope he is well and has success where ever hes at."  Winter turns his attention back to the captain. "Will we get access to equipment if we require it?"

Marlena nods to their newest member, "I am Marlena Jamirez. Pleased to make your acquittance. So both Sidnas and Dax have left? Any word on Arianna? Did she make it off the planet alright?"

Smiling Winter response to Marlena's question. "Oh I feel sorry for anyone that tangles with her. She would give them a touge leashing they would never forget." Winter laughs a little remeber the time they had exchanged words on something she was a force to be reconed with to be sure.

Droga shows a slight smile, but you can see that he isnÂ´t completely without worry.
"I think we can agree to that point. We are not sure about her whereabouts. When we discovered the imperial trap, lieutenant Dex here - he nods to the familiar pilot - tried to reach her, but was unsuccessfull. But as you said, she is most likely fine"
He turns back to Marlena.
"Yes, as far as we know, they left together, shortly after your arrival here. Dax was nearly uninjured, and Sidnas was able to leave the bacta tanks after a remarkably short time. Must be some Jedi trait I suppose. Other than that though, we have no lead on them, but we are investigating the case"

He clears his throat and rises from his seat.
"But lets get down to buissness, shall we? Our intelligance has gathered evidence of an imperial research facility located on the mountain world of Taspin III. Apparently, their research is of military nature. We have not managed to gather detailed intelligence of what excatly they are doing there, but since the rise of the new order, palpatines forces has been equipped with new gear rapidly. You are to go there and investigate, and if possible bring back samples of their research. Dex will serve as your pilot on this trip, and will remain at the ship to watch your backs, should you need a way out. Apart from him, another agent will be joining you, Tirin Medala. She will be waiting for you at the ship"
He looks at Winter.
"To answer your earlier question, we will try to provide you what gear you might need, but donÂ´t expect the highest stock here. If there are no further questions, move out, and may the Force be with you"

Jade sat there in is seat for a few minutes and leaned forward.  "Sir if we're given the chance, how much distruction and set-backs do you want us to give them at the factory...is it?"

### **ganthet** (2009-01-23 10:30:13)

Winter smiles at the new guys question. "I think I am starting to like you allready. I say we wipe the whole thing out if we can."  Winter starts to go over what equipment might come in handy for this mission.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-23 11:14:11)

Droga laughs a bit, and shakes his head.
"While I admire your spirit, donÂ´t go out of your way to destroy anything. This is a reconnisance and information gathering mission first and foremost. You go in, get what you can, and get out. Besides, I doubt you could bring the whole facility down even if you tried. According to our spies, it is carved out of the mountain itself"

### **ganthet** (2009-01-23 13:09:50)

"Well if we can should we throw a hydrospanner in the works. Maybe to cover our track if needed?" Winter contiues his thoughts on what he might need.

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope: Chapter II

### **Alicia** (2009-01-26 07:47:29)

Marlena looks at Winter seriously. "We don't exactly have an excellent track record with infiltrating bases and not getting caught." With that in mind she looks to Droga, Have your spies discovered a means for us to get in?"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-26 15:45:02)

"While they have been unable to make a complete survey, we have located a possible breach point. Like I said, the facility has been carved out of the mountain itself, and a large part of it is located inside the mountain. Luckily, at the lower levels, there is a large network of tunnels running through the mountain that you should be able to access without being noticed"

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope: Chapter II

### **ganthet** (2009-01-26 16:49:28)

Winter looks over at Marlena. "What? We lived through it didn't we." Winter realizes that stealth wasn't one of his strong suits, but maybe this mission would be different. "So do you know how vast these tunnels are under the factory?"

---

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope: Chapter II

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-26 16:55:17)

"We actually havenÂ´t been able to map out the tunnel network to any greater extent, but it appears that they connects to the facility at a number of places, so you should be able to work your way through without too much trouble"

Jade looked over at the other apparent crew he was going on this mission with and shrugged.  He then turned his head toward Droga and spoke up.  "What specifications do we have for drop off and pick up for the mission...and how long do we have to complete the mission?"

---

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope: Chapter II

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-27 05:44:49)

Droga nods and points to Dex, standing to his side.
"Dex will remain with the ship during the operation, ready to pick you up whenever you feel like leaving. You wonÂ´t have specific timeframe to work under"

---

## Re: In the Shadow of Hope: Chapter II

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-28 18:12:00)

Suddenly, DrogaÂ´s comlink beeps. As he checks it, he rises from his seat.
"Excuse me, but something has come to my attention that I have to deal with. Dex will help you obtain whatever supplies youÂ´ll need, and then you may get underway"
Picking up his pace, he leaves the room with a worried look on his face. Dex rises as well, and starts to leave the room.
"If youÂ´ll follow me weÂ´ll stop by the supplies on our way. Tirin should have the ship ready for takeoff"

((Fast forwarding out of courtesy to the new players wanting in. If you want any supplies, you get 1500 Credits to equip yourself with, and you can have things up to Restricted. PM me what you got))
Once the group was settled and ready to move out, Dex brings them to the hangar bay and the ship, the same YT-transport that had bailed Winter and Marlena off Viraxia. Near the ship was a Togruta, seemingly working to load the ship. There was also another character there, wearing a full-body suit and mask, covering much of his looks.
Dex moved forward towards the Togruta.
"HowÂ´s it going Tirin? She ready to fly yet?"

Turning, you can see the green and gold bodysuit fit like a glove, enhanced her toned form. Smooth red skin is interrupted with wide, white ovals around the black pupils of her eyes. The two upward and four downward tentacles on her head are striped black and white, immediately distinctive of her species. Upon seeing the team, she charms up a radiant smile. **"As ready as we are. She's an incredible ship. I'm Tirin Medala and it seems we'll be on the mission together."**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-04 14:20:18)

Dex nods and turns to the man standing next to Tirin.
"And just who might you be? I suppose you are the new guy they would send my way. Nice meeting you. I am Dex"
((In case no one got it, the other guy is diggityÂ´sÂ´s character  <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->))
