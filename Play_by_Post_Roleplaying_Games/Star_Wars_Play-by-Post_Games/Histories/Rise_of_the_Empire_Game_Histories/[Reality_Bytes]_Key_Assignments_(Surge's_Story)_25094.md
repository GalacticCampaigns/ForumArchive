# [Reality Bytes] Key Assignments (Surge's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-01 12:08:41)

The power flickers inside the *Happy Hutt*, a smokey cantina located on the outskirts of Tyrena. Patrons don't seem to mind much, as long as the drinks keep coming. Some even prefer the darker atmosphere. One such being sits alone in the back, and he's not there for the alcohol...
Tardiness in his line of work indicates one of two things: the prospective employer has met an untimely death or the prospective employee is about to. Bounty hunters often find themselves setup by local authorities attempting to apprehend, or eliminate, the competition. It's usually an utter failure on their part since the good hunters can spot a trap and the bad ones won't last long enough to make the rendez-vous. The droid hunter known as Surge rises from his booth and begins to make for the door when halfway to the exit a scantily-clad Zabrak female steps into his path. She raises a hand: "**Leaving so soon, honey? I'm sure there's something here you'd like…**" She approaches Surge and drapes an arm across his metal frame, casually slipping a data card into his left hand. "**On second thought, maybe not. Too bad…**" she says, moving away and back into the willing arms of other cantina patrons.
The weather outside rages on, with electrical storms reported all across the continent and flash floods threatening the lowlands. Surge is able to access the information on the card in a nearby alcove, a small shelter from the deluge. He is once more thankful that droids lack the nervous system to experience the cold and wet like organic beings. Such a fragile existence it must be - pain, disease, death. These things are merely tools in Surge's skilled hands available to the highest bidder.
It appears to be a standard bounty contract:
**Bounty**: 1,000,000c
**Details**: This contract is for the killing or capture of a high-profile target currently located in an maximum-security facility. Proof of completion is required upon delivery of payment. Report back to courier when contract is fulfilled.
**Notes**: *We thought you might be more interested in this than anyone around, so you've got dibs. No need for confirmation of receipt, just bring us the body (or whatever's left). The Zabrak girl will be your contact.*
Attached to the contract is an image file with a caption: *Bonner Wraith, Kessel Spice Mines*.
Surge recalls the name from a few weeks ago. The news was all over the Holonet: Wraith was some sort of crime lord wannabe that bungled a robbery attempt. The courts ignored his plea of insanity and sentenced him to life in the spice mines. A sentence that somebody wanted cut short, and Surge is only happy to oblige.
Placing the contract in his internal storage compartment, he looks back up at the sky. The dark clouds obscure any hint of the stars in all directions. A single ship takes flight from somewhere across the city and seems to fare well enough, but it's unlikely any public transports will be leaving until morning - plenty of time for an ambitious assassin to begin his work.

*So, this was the lucrative job my contact sent me here for…*
Reviewing the contract a second time, the assassin droid replaced it inside his chassis, and began to ponder the job. It wasn´t going to be easy, that much was clear. After all, the message was correct in that the Kessel mine was a maximum security facility, and that naturally was making it a bit difficult to get in. On the other hand, a lot of that security was applied towards keeping people from getting *in*.
The payment did sound good though. He didn´t care much for hard credits, but they did make his job easier, and allowed him to be more effective at what he did. Over the last years he had become quite proficient at crafting makeshift gear from whatever scrap he could find, and while it worked, equipment crafting wasn´t his primary function.
He figured he wouldn´t get off the planet via any public transport until the next day, but that worked out quite well with him, as he had work to do. Leaving the cantina he activated his sensor field to keep himself aware of anyone trying to jump him. Corellia had its rough spots after all, and his appearance didn´t give him away as a fighter. As he headed out on the street he made a few calls and stopped by some shady dealers on the way, looking for anyone that could put him in contact with Wraith´s syndicate.

Two hours of searching had revealed little. Most shops - even the "shady" ones - were closing by the time Surge finally found what he was looking for, though in a very unlikely way. After his inquiries at *Junk And Stuff*, a local pawn shop, he picked up a follower. He doubled back by way of the many side alleys and managed to get the drop on the novice tracker. Having lost sight of his quarry, the hooded figure wandered up and down the streets in something of a panic. Clearly dedicated but throughly soaked in the downpour, the young man was scared half to death when Surge suddenly appeared out of the shadows.
"***AH!* It's *you*! I mean, um,**" he clears his throat and assumes a more intimidating tone - one that utterly fails to work on Surge, "**…you're the one looking for a lead on Bonner Wraith's syndicate? I overheard you in the *J and S* talking with the owner, and I think we might be able to make a deal. I know a guy who knows some codes, ya know?**"
Humans *can* be some of the most devious, manipulative, conniving and scheming con artists in the whole galactic underground. This young lad, dressed in a long black hooded robe, soaked to bone, and clearly afraid for his life, is such a mockery of that reputation his name may as well be Little Boy Cliché.

The assassin droid waited a few moments before he stepped out of the shadows, apparently almost scaring his supposed shadow to death. Whoever he was, he obviously hadn´t thought this through before he began to stalk Surge. The droid didn´t have any visible weapons, but given the mans reaction it seemed likely that he knew something about his reputation. As he observed the man from top to toe, his photoreceptors took on a deeper red tone than usual, as he carefully moved closer with slow steps.
**"From what you are telling me, it sounds like you know very little yourself, and consequently are of very little use to me. So any deal we make would be the one where you take me to someone that does know something in exchange for your life. And then I´m being generous. How does that sound?"**

The boy jumps at the sounds of Surge's mechanical voice. His eyes widen as the assassin droid draws near until, at last, he's almost cowering. Grateful to still be drawing breath, he gives an eager nod and the beckons for Surge to follow.
The two travel through the rain and arrive shortly at a deserted cantina. The lights are out and the bar closed, but a small gathering can be seen clearly by Surge near the back. Five individuals of varying height and age, all Human and all armed. Under a considerable amount of stress if their body heat is any indication, and the droid is once more pleased to have his unique sensor suite. A single candle burns on the table and the light dances across each of their faces - weathered and scarred with the sort of experience one would expect from a lifetime of hardship. The would-be spy approaches the table first and goes quickly to the side of the man seated in the center. "**Here he is father, I… found him for you.**"
The man gives a genuine laugh, as do his comrades, and he heartily pats the boy on the back. "**Did you now? Well we may make a tracker out of you *yet*!**" Another round of raucous laughter and the boy grins sheepishly. The noise dies down, and the attention shifts to Surge.
"**Thank you for sparing my son. Someone with *your* reputation left a worrisome father with his doubts…**"
"**Now,**" he straightens in his chair, "**to business. We know you have been contracted to kill Wraith. We, too, want him dead. That slime deserves a more painful and humiliating death than anything we could conjure up…and we have *extensive* experience with that sort of thing.**" The man glances around the table at his brethren, sharing memories Surge could only guess at. He continues: "**These,**" he pulls a datapad slowly out his coat pocket, "**are access codes that will get you all the way into Bonner's detention level. We're not sure which cell he's in - they change that sort of thing on a regular basis. You'll have to get creative about your appearance, but,**" retrieving another object from his pocket, "**this is one of the security droid restraining bolts. It'll give you the identification codes required to be assigned to that level. We are not your employers, and we cannot pay you. We ask nothing in return however, only the comfort that we have aided in a justice that has waited for too long.**"
The man leans forward, candlelight creating deep shadows in the aged face. Surge's facial recognition software begins a side-by-side comparison to the image provided with the contract. It becomes unnecessary after the next words spoken:
"**My name is Jan Wabasha. You're going to kill my scumbag son, and I'd like to help.**"

Surge listened to the man, and carefully accepted the datapad and the restraining bolt. He would have to access the bolt to make sure it contained what it was supposed to before he engaged it, and check the access codes as well. He didn´t trust this man or his associates one bit, and a piece of him wanted to drop them all where they stood. Still, he could always do that later. The main question these men raised with him was why they didn´t simply used these tools to reach Wraith on their own. There had to be more to it than simply a lack of imaginative ways of ending the prisoners life.
He didn´t press the issue anymore though, assuming that the men would most likely be secretive about it. He had intended to seek Wraith´s syndicate out in order to con them into thinking he had been hired to assist in the breaking out oh Wraith, hopefully being able to use whatever assets they had to get to him, but this worked out as well.
**"Well then, I guess a thanks would be in order unless I knew you´re only assisting me to get your son killed. Just as a matter of convenience, how do I get in touch with you, should I need it. You know, to deliver any remaining pieces"**
*Or to settle things in case you are trying to set me up…*

The men look at each other, then back to Jan.
"**Remaining pieces? I don't expect there to be anything recognizable left, but you can keep them if you like. I've done my homework. I know you'll get the job done.**"
He rises, lifting the candle with him: "**As for getting in touch with us, well, I can't see why that would be necessary. There's a secure com-channel listed on that datapad and that'll get our attention should you require it.**"
Jan files out into the backroom, followed closely by his favored son and then the others. The last man to leave shuts the hatch and Surge can hear the electronic lock engage. He can see through the walls clearly though, and sees the group leave out the back door and head off in separate directions.

Surge watches the heat signatures of the humans fade away into the distance, and returned back onto the street once again. While the meeting had not been exactly what he had expected, he did have what he had originally been seeking, a way to get to Wraith. Finding a nice, secluded spot among the alleyways he settled down and took out the restraining bolt he had been given. The datapad he was less worried about, but if any malicious software had been hidden among the things he had been given, they´d likely be found in the bolt, as that one would be directly attached to his system.
Carefully opening it, he hooked it up to the datapad installed in his forearm, and began to scan whatever data was contained within for abnormalities, while at the same time taking a look at the interior of the bolt. He was far from an expert on advanced technology, but he believed himself at least capable of spotting some piece of hardware that absolutely looked out of place.

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-07 22:39:26)

Surge takes his time analyzing the restraining bolt, knowing it could be the ruin of any droid foolish enough to install it without taking such precautions. He sees a lot of wear and tear - this is not a new bolt, and looks to have been removed with little elegance. Surge's optics don't detect anything unexpected structurally-speaking. He compares the size, weight, and composition along with scoring patterns and internal hardware with every known restraining bolt configuration - it all checks out. The integrity of the data on the datapad also seemed to be acceptable, indicating that either these items were truly "bug-free" or whoever was planning a trap for Surge had a significant amount of skill.
Three hours later the storm begins to subside. The sun is beginning to creep through the clouds and the early morning traffic starts to pick up in the streets. It's unlikely that Surge would be able to continue uninterrupted.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I'm going to let you **Take 20** on a **Mechanics** roll for the restraining bolt *or* a **Use Computer** check for the datapad, and then you can use the following roll (both modifiers for Surge on those skills is +11) for the other one. I'm doing this for two reasons: 1) I want to begin the next day, even though it's still pretty early (just after sunrise), and 2) Because I think every roll I've seen this week has been eight or less with one exception. If you want to spend more time analyzing the other item in a less public place, you can do that too (about 1hr to take 10, 2hrs to take 20). Okay:
***13*** <- [2] 1d20 + 11

*Well, well…maybe I won´t have to kill you after all, old man…maybe…*
It didn´t look like there was anything wrong with the restraining bolt, so Surge decided that he would have to trust it to behave as expected. With the sun rising, it wasn´t like he was going to sit around and work on it anymore. The time had come to make his way to Kessel, and though he had long contemplated stealing a ship to be able to secure his ability to travel freely, he decided to make use of whatever public transportations were available. This would likely save him the trouble of getting a permission to land on Kessel, and once this job was done, he´d be set to purchase pretty much whatever ship he wanted.
Making his way to the nearest spaceport, the assassin droid started to look for a transport that would take him to Kessel. The hunt was on.

Being on the outskirts of the city, the closest spaceport to Surge was a small franchise by the name of *Budget Port*. It wasn't nearly as big as the central ports were, but the likelihood of finding passage to a prison planet was much higher. Before entering the main facility - little more than a two-story shack - Surge scans the landing platform. There a few smaller vessels used to ferry cargo and passengers to the interior of the city or low orbit, but these are in varied states of disrepair. Only one ship matches Surge's requirements: a Barloz-class freighter with the name *Steel Sun* emblazoned on the side. The ship appears in excellent condition. He detects no organic lifeforms aboard, but there are a handful of various droids.
Upon entering the main doors, Surge is greeted by the rust-stained droid attendant:
"**Greetings! Welcome to Budget Port, Lower Tyrena's only Class B spaceport.**"
The attendant isn't the only thing in need of cleaning, and Surge is able to spot a small astromech charging behind the counter who could use some repair as well. Outside, coming in from the freighter, is a tall, spindly droid wearing a quaint captain's cap.
"**How may I help you this morning?**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Droid captains with all-droid crews? Seems you and I have been here before...
I considered rolling a Gather Information roll for you, but your modifier (I believe) is only a +1 and even if you rolled a natural 20 you're looking for transport to the most popular prison in the galaxy - not something you'd find at a mainline port. And since Marina pretty much blew off this droid, maybe we can get a little more non-essential NPC development in here! ![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)

Surge took a moment to scan the surroundings before responding to the captain in a slightly more friendly tone than he was used to using. After all, he didn´t really have any problems with other droids, just their owners. Which meant that he was actually somewhat happily surprised that the crew of this particular vessel seemed to be very non-organic.
**"I am looking for passage to the Kessel system, and the absence of organic employees aboard your ship struck me as generating an exceptionally pleasant environment to spend such a trip in. If you have need of an extra pair of hands on board, I possess skills in mechanics and computer operations as well. Though it seems like the need for repairs is low on your ship, which is more than you can say about most vessels in this junkpile"**

The captain pauses, looks Surge over, turns to the attendant and emits the closest thing to a *guffaw* any vocabulator could manage.
"**Well now sonny, that's *rich!* You must be off your ever-lovin' *rocker* to spout off like that at anyone wearin' a fancy cap!**" The droid gives another round of mechanical laughter and slaps a handful of credits on the counter. "**This'll do for the rest of the day darlin', we'll be off by supper time.**" He gives the flustered attendant a wink and glances behind the counter. "**Where's my best mate…? Ah, catching some shut-eye I see. Good, good,**" then, leaning in closer, he whispers "**…you get all kinna crazies in here, huh sweetie'?**"
"**Captain Steel, you are *most* welcome. Your payment is satisfactory for seven hours of parking time. Please enjoy your stay in Tyrena.**"
"**Yes, yes…**" he walks away while she's still speaking and stops in front of Surge, rolling his optics in a gesture of exasperation. "**I can't tell ya how many times I tried to thaw *that* ol' fish but she'd have none of it! The little one's spunky, and a little uneasy on his feet, but he's got heart. But enough about us, what to do with you…? Hmmm…**" he taps his metal foot and ponders the offer for a few moments, then snaps his fingers and points at Surge: "**Okay kiddo, you're in. You're right 'bout the repairs, we don't need any - *knock on wood*(he raps his chest) - but I do have some, uh, *business* to take care of. We'll be lifting off this afternoon so take whatever time ya need to say your *loveyous* and meet us out there. We'll hammer out the details later, fair enough?**"

Captain Steel's attitude is now **friendly**, and you've got some time before lift-off. Do what you like, but I'm going to start to have Surge and Marina's stories join together.

**"Certainly, though if I may ask, what kind of business are you looking to perform? I have been known to handle a variety of tasks in the past, and perhaps I could be of assistance?"**
He wasn´t lying, he was capable of performing a number of tasks, but the way the captain had mentioned this business it sounded like it might not be a simple business transaction. And given that he was in a small spaceport on the outskirts of Corellia, where criminal syndicates and gangs ran free, he saw a prospective chance of maybe getting to slot a few organics before embarking on the trip. It would perhaps not be necessary, but it would be something to pass the time with before liftoff. Additionally it was a way to perhaps gain the captains favor, which the assassin droid assumed he might need in the time to come, especially to get himself off Kessel.

Slapping a metal hand on Surge's shoulder, Captain Steel replies: "**Okay, son, you can tag along. Never know when you might need a friend!**"
The two leave the dilapidated spaceport and make their way through the morning streets. The good captain continues to put his vocabulator to good use...
"**Now a man's past is his own business, but you don't look like a mechanic to me. Most of my intrepid crew does fantastic work, but they *are* a bunch'a Basics and don't often think outside the small metal box they're trapped in. I certainly wouldn't mind havin' someone with a bit o'brain in his cranial cavity, ya know? Heh, sailing the void is a better life than any could ask fer, but sometimes ya gotta wheel and deal in circles ya'd rather avoid as not. Creative thinking - *original* ideas - now there's the real treasure. Any man, or droid, that can think on his feet is worth his weight in credits.**"
He pauses and they turn a corner, almost running over a group of Rodian youth playing at Stormies and Jedi.
"**Ah, little tikes! Were we ever so young? Life can be mighty queer. Take *you* for instance: I've got a notion you and I have some good days ahead. Oh, but here we are. Put on yer business face…**"
Captain Steel and Surge enter *The Cleft*, an upscale hotel/diner in the most modern neighborhood Lower Tyrena has to offer. A center stairway leads up to some turbolifts. Everywhere are organic beings, enjoying their meals. Waitress droids scurry about from table to table, taking orders from new-comers. The two find a booth near the front of the diner.
"**Guess we're a bit early…?**"
The captain's words seem to suggest that he wasn't expecting to wait.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, I hope that wasn't too rushed. You've got some time to converse with Captain Steel about whatever's on Surge's mind (payment, services, "business", etc.). I haven't included anything about your "X-Ray vision" because I didn't think that was something that was always active, but if you want to give a good scan, you're welcome to. I did, by the way, notice a piece of equipment in one of the books last night that grants heat vision - out to 100m.

As he walked with the captain, Surge came to miss the old times when droids only spoke to confirm orders in the war, or when he was alone on a mission in complete silence.
**"I was constructed to perform a wide range of tasks, of which mechanics is but one. But the strength of task focused programming and design shouldn´t be underestimated, as with focus comes efficiency. Though I have to agree, in my travels I have come cross a number of droids that were little more than tools, and I can only feel pity for them"**
He followed the captain into the diner and they took a seat, Surge positioning himself to get as wide a view of the place as possible. He laid his left arms on the table, fingers drumming slowly.
**"You have not yet told me what kind of business we are out to take care of captain. My core contains a number of protocols for various interactions with other beings, so if you could tell me I could better prepare"**

## Re: Key Assignments (Surge's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-14 11:02:20)

After hearing Surge's inquiry, Captain Steel let out a small mechanical chuckle and calmly folds his hands on the table.
"**And *you've* not yet told me why you're headed to Kessel, friend. It's tough making a living out there and sometimes we have to do things we don't like. Many a folks'd just as soon never talk to a droid anymore - that's hard enough. Running a full crew of'em makes some people downright upset. We get along by doing little jobs for those who - like yourself - prefer working with the inorganic side of society. It's been a while since yours truly had a good mindwipe, but the crew gets'em pretty regularly. They don't remember things like the Confederacy of Independent Systems… or the *Republic*…**"
The captain let's those last words hang in the air a moment and glances around to ensure their privacy. His voice has now dropped to a lower, more serious tone. His optics squint at Surge as he continues:
"**We were all something else once, ya know? Take me. You wouldn't know it by looking, but I used to fly one of them big *Venator-class* ships for the clones. Yessiree, that was some kinda job. Then things changed, and the Jedi weren't the only ones lookin' to hide. Lots of dangers, lots of bounty hunters. And not a few *assassins*…**"
Steel says the word carefully, but the accusation is clear. Again giving a brief pause before continuing, he resumes his more jovial mannerisms:
"**I managed to make it this far because ol' Steel is a survivor. You're a survivor too I think. I won't ask about what you're going to Kessel for, but it'll take more than just fuel and charm to get there. I'm on Corellia to pick-up a shipment that needs "special care" on its way to some Hutts in the Outer Rim. I don't mind taking you on as some extra muscle for when we make the delivery - and after *that* job's finished, I'll be open to accepting *new* ones.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

What the good captain is offering, and what I think Surge has worked enough jobs to now recognize (and so I don't have to make NPC's plot-blabbering buffoons), is to bring Surge to Kessel for a fee - after he finishes up his current contract. Let me have'm if you've got'm. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

The assassin droid listens to the droid captains words, and if his features were capable of producing a smile, they would probably have done so.
**"You are right in that many people don´t hold our kind pretty high after the war. However, given that and how we were treated during the war, I´m actually a bit surprised that there hasn´t been more hatred going the other direction. Still, I hear there are those out there trying to change that…"**
Leaving the words hang a bit in the same manner as Steel had just done, Surge felt his imaginary smile grow wider.
**"Now since the clarification of my role in your business have been labeled as *muscle*, I can say that your decision to accept my assistance will most likely turn out to be a fortunate one. I have been known to carry out similar tasks in the past, with highly satisfactory results. As for my reasons for going to Kessel, let´s just say I´m also about to perform a highly lucrative job. One that would give me very good opportunities to compensate anyone willing to assist me"**

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-18 12:06:37)

"**Well sonny, that's sounds like a deal to me.**"
Captain Steel extends his metal hand to Surge to finalize the agreement. As if on cue, a pair of small labor droids carrying a large crate between them approach the booth led by an aging Dug. His expression is somber, and he seems to speak plainly - as if either disinterested or disappointed in the transaction. He eyes Surge carefully, then turns to the captain:
"**You must be Captain Steel. This is the package that is to be delivered to Jabba's palace on Tatooine. These droids will accompany you to your ship and then return to me afterwards. Payment has been arranged to be released upon their return to me, per out agreement. Do you have any further questions?**"
Steel looks the crate over as it hovers on its repulsorpad. "**Can't say as I do, friend.**" he replies, reaching out to pat one of the labor droids on the head. "**Pleasure doin' business with ya.**" Satisfied with his answer, the Dug turns and simply walks away abruptly.
"**Well now lads, what have we here I wonder…?**" Steel asks the smaller droids. The pair look at each other and then back to the captain with a shrug. "**Oh well, not part of the deal anyhow I suppose. Shall we?**" Surge and Captain Steel rise and leave the diner with the crate and it's handlers in tow.

Alright, so Captain Steel and Surge seem to have reached a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll be sure Surge earns his pay. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif) You can include a **Perception** roll (no taking 10/20) in your next post to try and see what's in the crate with your advanced sensors, but you'll *also* need a **Knowledge (Technology)** roll to make sense out of it. If you don't have anything of consequence for Surge to say or do, that's okay - I'll move you onto the ship and we'll go from there.

Surge takes the captains hand, satisfied the matter have been closed. He doesn´t mind helping Steel out, and if his employers wanted Wraith dead as soon as possible, they should have said so. Though if they got upset with him for not completing the job with haste, that would count as a reason to slot them. Yes, perhaps he should in fact try to provoke them into being angry with him...
He broke of the thought pattern when he noticed the two droids and the Dug approaching. He remained silent during the exchange, but ran a quick scan on the crate to try and determine its content. He was no expert on advanced technology, but he might recognize the signature of tibanna gas found in weaponry or the energy emission from a baradium-core explosive, since those were things he were somewhat familiar with.
When the captain rose to leave, he followed behind, observing the small droids carrying the crate.

Perception check should be doable, but since I´m not trained in Technology, I suppose it´ll be an auto-fail if it has a DC higher than 10. Still, nothing wrong with trying.

The posse of automatons leave *The Cleft* and make their way through the morning streets and back to the *Steel Sun*. Captain Steel's attempts at small talk with the labor droids is mostly fruitless, and despite Surge's best attempts he can't begin to makes sense of the readings on the crate's contents. The ship is alone on the pad, with only a handful of smaller transport vehicles around the perimeter of the platform for cargo purposes. They proceed through the main entrance and arrive at the main desk. The attendant notices them and looks up from the counter: "**Greetings Captain Steel, leaving so soon?**"
"**Alas, it would appear so. Don't you worry your pretty little head about it, my dear. Ol' Steel'll be sure to get back soon enough…**" he replies, then in a lower tone adds "**…maybe we can make use of that guest room upstairs, eh?

An excited burst of chirps and whistles is heard as the group continues onto the platform and halt just before the loading ramp.
"**This is her, the *Steel Sun*. Oh, I give lip service to many a fair lady, but my mechanical heart beats for only one lass in all the galaxy. Ain't she the prettiest sight t'ever grace your optics?

Satisfied that they were underway, Surge followed the captain back to the ship. When Steel suggested that he take care of any unfinished business quickly he just shrugged and started to board the ship. Halfway up the ramp the captain commented on him not introducing himself, and he turned around.
**"And what would your guess be then, captain? Like I said, I have been known to perform a number of various tasks over the years, and as such I have assumed a vast number of designations, though of course there is one that I hold closer to my core than the others.

The *Steel Sun* is a an older model Barloz-class freighter, but it's a welcome contrast to to the *Budget Port*'s rusty and out-dated appearance. Surge proceeds up the loading ramp and sees, as his sensors had already indicated, a vast array of small and medium-sized droids working busily. Some are stock droids with little variation from their original designs and some seem to be little more than spare parts welded together for an unclear purpose - but all are clean and well-kept. The deck, too, is free of clutter and debris and there's no sign of staining or damage typically present in a cargo bay. The crate has been set down in the corner and the two little droids that had carried it aboard rush past Surge and down the ramp.
"**Welcome aboard kiddo, get ready for some fun!**" says the captain, slapping Surge on the back and heading off towards the front of the ship. "**You there, look lively now! Chop chop!**"
Moments later Surge feels the ship break orbit and make its jump to hyperspace.

Five days into the six-day journey through hyperspace Surge's emergency protocols awaken him from his charge cycle. A droid crew has little need of bunks and freshers and one of Captain Steel's modifications to the *Steel Sun* is conversion of the passenger cabins into charge stations for the crew. A quick scan with his unique sensor abilities reveals all the crew is in the main cargo bay and in various states of disrepair. At the front of the ship, roaming around the cockpit is a mechanical construct giving off conflicting readings - similar to the readings that Surge had from the crate that they're to deliver to Jabba. The ship itself seems to have now dropped out of hyperspace and come to a full stop.

If you're using the map of the ship (which isn't something I'm requiring) you're in the bottom right #6 cabin. You're not yet in "combat" anyway, so you're free to roam about.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-10-26 12:10:31)

*Well, this was unexpected…*
As his systems begins a quiet power up, the assassin droid makes a quick assessment of the situation, trying to determine why his charge cycle had been interrupted without anyone being present to interact with him. A quick scan of the surroundings identifies the signatures of multiple inorganic beings in the main cargo hold - presumably parts of the crew - and a very distorted signal coming from the cockpit, a mere dozen meters away. Never one to like confusing readings - he does have some pretty advanced hardware to make sure that doesn´t happen - Surge makes the assumption that something is out of place.
As he gets up from the charge station and flexes his locomotion systems and appendages, he identifies the readings coming from the cockpit as similar to those he got from the crate they were supposed to deliver to Jabba the Hutt. Was it possible that the crate had been containing some kind of droid? Or perhaps the captain had simply placed the crate in the cockpit for some reason, but the fact that he could not feel the typical rumblings of a ship going through hyperspace bothered him, as by his estimate they should not yet be at their destination.
With usual caution, he engages the systems in his right arm as he moves out of the small room he is in, causing his hand to retract back into the enlarged forearm and leaving only a wide opening in its place. As he moves close to the cockpit, he raises his blaster arm in front of him as his left hand pushes the controls to open the door.
((
I´m just noticing here that if things go to combat, that map is using a different scale than the one assumed by the rules. 1 square is normally 1,5 meters, but on this map it is 3. I´d also like to ready an action to fire at anything hostile - that would be anything that is not a familiar droid that does anything like charge at Surge, draw a weapon or similar actions.

The cockpit door slides open with its tell-tale sound and in a just a glimpse Surge's sensor array takes in the scene:
Straight ahead, approximately nine meters in front of the doorway, is a mass of durasteel and wiring with chunks of hanging synth-flesh. Some portions seem to be mere holographic projections, flickering on and off at random. It's medium size, bipedal design and lack of organic life signs indicate it is - or *was* some point - a heavily modified droid. It has clearly suffered massive damage to it's hardware and probably its higher processing capabilities. It gives the overall appearance of one of the junk droids that roam Raxus Prime rather than any one particular make or model. The hostage crew in the hold isn't the work of a brute though, and Surge's caution is certainly warranted.
The hulking form cowers over the pilot's controls, as yet unaware of - or unconcerned with - Surge's presence.

So, it was a mechanical intruder after all. That made things slightly simpler, in Surges book. Had it been an organic, he would have had a conflict of interest between his desire to shoot it on sight, and the logical reasoning of trying to keep it alive for questioning. With a machine, he could do both, as long as he didn´t completely destroyed its databanks.
Rifle arm raised, he stepped into the cockpit, discharging several powerful blaster bolts as he did so towards the unidentified droid.
((
I´ll use my surprise action to shoot the droid, and if I go first in the normal Initiative order (and the thing isn´t down yet) I´ll shoot again. I´ll not fire again if it goes down after the first attack, since my intention is to not wreck it completely, just disable it. And also if I don´t go first in Initiative I´ll hold fire, since I may want to take a different action.

Surge's first round catches the droid by surprise and finds its mark, knocking lose a shoulder panel and shorting out one of the flickering holo-projectors. It turns slowly, face and front torso also heavily damaged. Exposed wires pouring out of his chest spark as the droid's optics narrow and he advances on Surge swiftly, swinging a mighty arm.
"**TeeKay!**" it rumbles, its vocabulator clearly as damaged as the rest of him.
Electric current arcs through his whole chassis and down his arm as he pounds his fist into Surge's midsection. The blow connects, but does little real damage.

Surge's blaster bolt burns through an opening in the durasteel plates and the mechanical monster stumbles backwards as it feels its demise at hand. His holographic databanks seems to hit overload and an array of past appearances flashes over its frame - different identities displayed on different areas. A final leap towards the door - but it's too late. The inner workings of the metal monstrosity have been destroyed. The mass of loose plating, projector nodes, wiring and indistinguishable components crashes to the floor loudly and scatter through the cockpit. The electricity that had been flowing over its surface continues to arc across the heap for a few more moments, then it too fades. A single optic sensor rolls out and comes to a stop at Surge's feet, staring up at him for a brief moment before going dark.
Whatever it was, it's parts now.

A quick scan of the cockpit revealed no more immediate threats to Surge, and so the assassin droid disabled his weapon arm, restoring his right hand to its normal state. Hearing the voice coming over the comm, he decides that he should see to the crew of the ship, but he makes a quick scan of the remains of the fallen droid to see if any of its parts seems to remain intact.
Gathering up whatever he finds, he starts to head for the main cargo bay of the ship, where he had picked up the signals of the crew.

The smoldering metal carcass holds little in the way of useful parts - everything that wasn't affected by the initial damage to the droid has been rendered beyond repair by Surge's blaster fire and the resulting electrical activity. An ordinary droid may have been content to consider the pile of scrap just that - scrap, Surge's advanced optics are, however, able to see some promise in a handful of the pieces.
"***What's going on?* That metal monstrosity managed to get the drop on me and the boys and left us all over the deck!**" Captain Steel's voice answers over the speakers.
Surge listens to the captain's reply as he makes his way to the main cargo bay. Once there, he takes in the scene: the all-droid crew lays scattered across the deck, mostly in repairable but currently disabled condition, with the captain in the center. His head has been knocked off the rest of his chassis and rests a few meters to the left of its crumpled frame. The crate they were to deliver to Jabba is tipped over in the corner, the lid off and its contents gone.
"**There ya are! I just *knew* there was a reason we met up! What do you say to giving us a hand…?**" Steel asks, somehow adding a hearty mechanical laugh.

Slightly disappointed that most of the droids vital parts seems to have been damaged beyond repair, Surge reasons that the machine must have been in worse shape than he thought for his attacks to devastate it so. He did catch sight of something of value though, what appeared to be a translator unit of some sort. The thing had taken its share of damage though, but from what he could gather, it wouldn´t take more skill than what he possessed to repair it, all he´d need would be to find some replacement parts for the more vital components.
Placing the unit in his internal storage, he moved into the cargo bay to witness the disturbing sight inside. Walking over to captain Steel, he picked up the droid commanders head and walked over to its chassis, and producing some tools, he went to work.

Surge left the captain to his own devices, and instead walked over to another one of the crewmembers.

Yanking it back upright, the assassin began to work on it. It wouldn´t be pretty, he knew, as his repairs would mainly consist of cutting away the excess parts, rather than buckling them out. Such was the way when most of the repair skills he had were self-taught, and about half the tool he had were composed of scrap pieces he had assembled.
He didn´t care though, if the result were unsatisfactory, the little fellow could always submit to more professional repairs later.

The droid crew now seems mostly capable of returning to their normal duties, or at least continuing the necessary repairs on their own, thanks to the efforts of Surge and Captain Steel. Steel nods at the assassin droid's suggestions and motions for Surge to follow him to the galley-turned-briefing room near the front of the ship. The two enter and the hatch closes securely behind them. The droid captain begins to address Surge in a lower volume than normal:
"**Let's lay our cards on the table here… *Surge*,**" he emphasizes the name, "**A lot of folks've tried the things you're talkin' about and failed. It's a tall order, even for you I think, but if you're serious then I think I can help out. I know a few people in Mos Eisley that might have access to the sort of hardware you'd need to level Jabba's palace, some sort of nano-detonite. Very big bang in a very small package. We could probably pack enough in that crate to suitably accomplish the task.**"
He pauses for a moment, making sure Surge is following along...
"**Alternatively… There's this service droid. A real chatty fella, used to work on the *Sun* in fact, real good with closing deals. He works for the Hutt now. It's a long story, one we don't have time for if we're going to get there on time, but he might be able to get ya in somehow. My position is a little trickier in all this - I have to convince Jabba that my job was to bring him a crate, whether it was empty or not.**"

The assassin droid wasn´t surprised that the captain had recognized him by name, he generally did very little to his his identity unless he was going undercover.

He listened patently to the other droid lay out his suggestions, and considered them for a moment.
**"All valid ideas, captain, though I would say the one that presents the least danger to either of us involves a substantial amount of explosives. It would also be the simplest, and with a little luck we can be off the planet even before the bomb goes off.

He stayed silent for a moment, considering the fact that he would be deviating the course from a highly lucrative job if he were to attempt this. On the other hand, extracting vengeance on the Hutt would please him a lot, and he still noted that his employers hadn´t specified the job as urgent.
**"Understand captain, I´m not necessarily going for killing Jabba outright, but simply to extract some vengeance. A substantial bomb detonating inside his palace is bound to cause some damage, but if the fat slime opens the crate himself, then all the better"**

Captain Steel listens to Surge's response carefully, impressed with both his determination and the casual way in which he spoke of attacking the crime lord.
"**Well I'll see what I can do 'bout stalling once we land - I'll give my buddies a ring and ya can go get your fill of explosives. Speakin' of landing… I better get this rig back under way. Not that I'd need ta tell you, but I'd keep this whole thing under wraps around the crew - might be too much for 'em, ya know?**"
The droid captain gives a little nod to Surge and leaves the small briefing room to re-calculate for the next hyper-jump.<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

The *Steel Sun* sets down approximately twenty-four hours later near the outskirts of Mos Eisley on the desert planet of Tatooine. It's a smaller port owned by an old Wookie smuggler known as Arriaddik that Steel met decades ago under similar circumstances. The droid walks down the landing ramp with arms outstretched, gesturing emphatically at the clearly outdated facilities:
"**Arri, my lad - how've ya been?! The place looks great!**"
The two meet at the bottom of the ramp, clasp hands, and begin a rather boisterous conversation in Shyriiwook as they head for the interior halls. Surge watches them from the cargo bay. Almost out of sight (even though Surge's enhanced sensors can track them easily through the aged and deteriorating walls) Captain Steel stops and points back towards the ship. The Wookie nods as if remembering something and then issues some commands to a nearby pit droid before continuing down the passageway with Steel. The little droid walks cautiously up the boarding ramp and approaches Surge:
**<Are you droid designation *Sonny***?>*
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

* Translated from Binary
Well he wouldn't use your real name, and you haven't given an alias so I went with what he calls you all the time. If there's anything else you wanted to do before landing you can do it, just put some sort of line break to bring you up to the present.

Surge watches from atop the landing ramp as the captain meets with his old friend, and if he had facial features he would have smiled at the sound of the Wookie language. He hadn´t been able to fully restore the salvaged translator unit to operative condition during the journey to Tatooine, and would probably need to replace a burnt set of wiring before he would get it done.
Curious species, Wookies. He had heard rumors about a tendency among them to rip the arms of droids, something that would naturally put any mechanic being on edge. Still, he had also heard about their supposed bravery and loyalty, qualities that he valued, and which put them way above some of the more disgusting species of the Galaxy, like the Neimoidians.
Watching the small pit droid work up the ramp, the assassin droid shifted his stance and took a few steps dowm to meet it.
**"That would be me, yes. What´s on your mind?"**

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-01 12:52:14)

<**Master Arriaddik has asked me to show you the storefront. Please follow me.**>
The little droid leads Surge across the hangar bay in the opposite direction of Steel and the Wookie, down a small hallway and then stops in front of a dead-end. He retrieves a little remote and the wall itself swings slowly open on large, rusty hinges. The light levels rise to reveal a decpetively large room with racks, shelves, and crates full to the brim with assorted weaponry. The pit droid proceeds to an area clearly denoted for explosives storage and motions to the racks:
<**Take your time, my master will be along presently to discuss prices.**> he says, retreating to his usual duties in the hangar area.
Surge can easily see a wide range of grenades, detonators, blocks of detonite and explosive charges - most likely all acquired illegally. In the center of the room against the back wall, near what passes for a dealer's counter and display, is a bin labeled "*Used*". It's more of a collection of parts than anything else, but then not everyone in the black market can afford the best.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Rather than list everything, assume everything from the books is present in some form and reasonable amount. My mind is picturing a scene similar to the part in the Matrix movie where the racks and racks of guns come flying in around Neo and Trinity. You can take a look at the weapons and stuff too - it's mostly all there. Exotic stuff probably won't be, but you can ask Arri when he gets there (next post). The bin might be a good place to find some new wiring for that translator... ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif) Expect serious mark-ups in price though (haggling is an option).

Left alone in the "storage", Surge took a look around. The Wookie seemed to have quite the arsenal on his hand, including some explosives that would most likely be capable of inflicting some serious damage if detonated inside Jabba´s palace. However, the glaring problem here was money - the assassin droid was running a bit low at the moment. After all, this whole trip had just been a detour from the things that provided him with his income. Still, he had picked up a trick or two about negotiating over the years, and knew that there were more ways than credits to make deals.
He was a bit curious about why the little droid had left though, and he did hope it would return. The Wookie language wasn´t one he had been programmed with, and since he hadn´t really been able to get the translator unit working properly, he wouldn´t really have any way to communicate with the Wookie without a third party.
((
Well, it´s not like I can make any huge purchases even at normal pricing, with my credits balance being a bit low. I can´t even afford to complete the translator unit without some haggling.

## Re: Key Assignments (Surge's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-03 12:53:02)

The wall closes behind the droid as he leaves, leaving Surge alone to examine Arriaddik's selection. It's not too long before a hatch behind the counter slides away and an aging Wookie ducks his large frame through. His thick brown fur has lighter highlights - an good indication that he's been around for sometime - and he wears a number of belts with different sized pockets. At his side hangs a heavily-modified blaster pistol. Surge can't identify all the components for certain, but it's clearly more powerful than its original design would indicate.
He waves a greeting to the assassin droid then retrieves a small drone from one of the belts and sets it on the counter. It carries an unusual energy signature for a droid and seems to have been modified just as much as the sidearm. Captain Steel clearly has good connections. The drone activates and hovers for a moment, receiving instructions from its master in Shyriiwook before turning to face Surge. Rather than address him correctly, it generates a full-size holographic image of an attractive young Zeltron female in shifting shades of the glowing blue. She flickers to life and studies Surge for a moment before turning back to Arriaddik:
"**Oh he's almost as cute as that captain!**" she teases. The drone adjusts its position, allowing her to take a few steps forward and address Surge directly. It's an odd exchange, since the sound is also projected by the drone - now nearly a meter and a half behind the hologram. "**Now what can we do for you, sweetie?**"
Her semi-transparent form waits patiently for an answer, but Arriaddik growls something low at the droid.
"**Okay, okay… don't get so cranky!**" she rolls her eyes and saunters to the racks of explosives. Assuming a more professional stature, she continues: "**Captain Steel has indicated your interest in something along these lines…**" she gestures to the items on display, "**…but left the specifics up to you. Everything you see has a price of course, but the nature of payment is negotiable. See anything you like?**"
The last line seems to carry more than one meaning and it becomes quite clear that Steel isn't the only eccentric droid around.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Like I said, feel free to make an offer for whatever you like. I don't know all the types of explosives available or the mechanics behind them, so just provide a reference for me. And credits don't have to be an issue - you can definitely haggle and make counter-offers, not to mention offer something else entirely.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-05 21:44:37)

Surge watched the pair for a moment, drifting from the Wookie, to the hologram, and back to the Wookie again. When the Zeltron points towards the explosives selection, the droid gives a slight nod.
**"The good captain and myself found us in the middle of an ambush because of a crate we were supposed to deliver to one Jabba the Hutt, and I think that a certain matter of payback is in order. After consulting with Steel, we have agreed that the best way of extracting such vengeance would be to load said crate with new content, preferably of the kind that releases massive kinetic energy in a spherical fashion as the crate is opened"**
He was pretty certain they both understood what he was going for, but made a quick pause for it to sink in anyway.
**"Unfortunately, I am caught quite literally between two jobs, and thus are at a low on credits. However, I was hoping we could come to some kind of arrangement. I would not expect the slimy Hutt to be very liked, so perhaps you could provide the goods in exchange for me providing the skills to pull it off. In fact, seeing your establishment here, I would expect that you could have a lot to gain by seeing Jabba out of the picture, or at the very least in a weakened state. Of course, there might be something else you need assistance with…I am sure the good captain told you that I have a rather diverse skill set…"**

Silence follows Surge's counter-offer as Arriaddik stares at him from behind the counter. The hologram flickers but is otherwise motionless. The hum of the drone's repulsor is the only thing that can be heard for some time, but eventually the Wookie breaks the tension. Laughing loudly, he manages to startle the droid and the Zeltron image fades out entirely. Arri walks around to the racks of explosives and retrieves a remote similar to the one the pit droid had. A small panel slides open in the wall and he motions for Surge to examine what lies within. The hologram reappears, this time closer to Surge, and begins to translate the Shyriiwook being spoken:
"**My master is pleased with your response, and was informed of your performance aboard the *Steel Sun*. He has developed a prototype weapon that should acheive the results you desire. It's a delicate balance of many sensitive components, but can be molded to fit just about any shape. A crate full of this would yield…**"
She continues in her professional manner, denoting statistics and blast radius information that Surge records for future use. His sensors are able to clearly identify a number of the parts: detonite, some power packs and thermal detonators, a synthetic fuel of some sort. There are other less classifiable features. Arriaddik seems to be quite adept at improvisation - even for a Wookie.
"**…very desirable. Your relationship to Captain Steel helps considerably in providing you with this resource, but we must ask something of you in return. A Zabrak female known as Saricia Naabrea has the misfoturtune of owing my master a great deal of credits and yet manages to elude us. Mos Eisley is a big place and, with the proper aliases and coin to spread around, one can disappear easily. We understand the nature of your task with Jabba and will begin fitting the crate at once for delivery. Upon your return, however, we must ask you to find Naabrea.**"
The main door swings open once more and a small team of droids identical to the one that led Surge into the hidden chamber enter and begin to unload the contents of the prototype with great care. Another team appears bearing the delivery crate and set it on the floor. They work speedily with little hesitation. Lastly, Captain Steel comes in through the door behind the counter and starts to address Surge - but sees the sultry Zeltron hologram and stops short. He steps slowly towards the shifting blue image, whose demeanor returns once more to it's unprofessional state:
"**Hell-o,**" he says in a soothing, deep mechanical voice, "**What have we here?**"
Whether the scene is scripted or not Surge can't tell, but Arri seems disinterested - or disgusted enough - and waits for any questions the droid assassin may have.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Persuasion** success - Arri is now *Friendly*! It's a prototype so I can play with the blast crater it leaves. It won't take long for the droids to finish fitting the crate and loading it and whatnot, but you've got a chance for any final questions or preparations if you like. Captain Steel is definitely Captain Skullwire's brother or something in my mind.

## Re: Key Assignments (Surge's Story)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-07 20:56:02)

The assassin droid listens with only half an audioreceptor as the Zeltron hologram goes through the specifications for the explosive device in front of him, and instead scans the thing with his own sensors. Technical data is all well and fine, but what he really is interested in is practical use, of which he is sure he has more knowledge than the other droid. The bomb is precisely what he would have expected from the Wookie: Crude, but highly effective. With any luck, it would detonate close to something reactive, which could cause a chain reaction of even more massive proportions. Yes, Jabba would regret messing with the wrong droid. Of course, logic dictated that the assault on the *Steel Sun* had been in no way associated with him, but he considered that fact a minor technicality only.
**"I think this will suffice, and I thank you for the assistance in binging some retribution to the big pile of fat. I hope to be able to return here someday and benefit from the increased traffic your market will most likely receive from an assault on Jabba´s palace"**
He paused for a moment as he noticed Steel entering the room, looking like he was about to say something, but when the captain was distracted by the hologram droid, he turned back to the Wookie.
**"As for your request…I am unwilling to make promises I cannot keep. I am sure you understands as well as I that there is a risk that me and the good captain must depart Tatooine rather rapidly, and in such an eventuality I would be unable to assist you, at least right away. I will, however, do what I can to gather as much intelligence as possible regarding the Zabrak females whereabouts while you prepare the crate for delivery. This way, should I be unable to personally complete the task, hopefully I can at least point you in the right direction. I hope this arrangement is satisfactory to you"**

## Re: Key Assignments (Surge's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-10 13:35:02)

The Wookie smuggler listens to Surge's response, chuckling at the thought of increased business though unsure how it would ever be traced back to him. Assassinations and general carnage were almost always good for business anyway. He realizes the possible need for Steel's rapid departure after the delivery and barks angrily at the drone, presently engaged in flirting with the Captain.
"**Oh, yes, sorry - what's that?**" the pale blue figure says, startled by Arri's summons. He instructs her in his native tongue and then waits for her translation. She turns to face Surge and does so:
"**Master Arriaddik understands your concerns and only asks that you give it your best. He's convinced someone with *your* reputation should have little problem with the matter. The shipment will be finished and loaded by this evening which gives you the better part of the day to work. The only other piece of information we can give you is this image, captured by our security droids during our last encounter…**" she motions to the drone itself, which ejects a small data card. "**…*When* she is delivered is not as important as keeping her *alive* enough to pay us. My master says Captain Steel's word is reason enough to trust you in this matter.**"
Surge retrieves the offered data card and displays the holographic image stored within. Saricia Naabrea comes to life in full color, hovering and rotating a few centimeters above the card. She's dressed more modestly and carries a pair of blaster pistols, but there's no mistaken her jat'i tattoos: this was the Zabrak that passed Surge the contract on Bonner Wraith in the *Happy Hutt* cantina.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Hope you don't mind me playing Surge a bit, but it was easier to get through this conversation and to the point. I wanted to introduce a sideplot originally but as I look at the timeframe in mind I think it might be best to stick with the Jabba business so I'm not rushing it. RP as you like, and let me know if you have any questions, but feel free to "get around to this later". If you don't spend the rest of the day looking for her but don't tell Arri you've seen her before it might look odd, but do what you want.

## Re: Key Assignments (Surge's Story)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-11 07:59:32)

Surge looked at the picture of the Zabrak female for a moment before taking the data card and stashing it. Now this was an interesting turn of events. Various ways to approach the situation began to formulate in his mind. The simplest way would seem to find enough information for Arriadik and his people to find her on their own, thus keeping his involvement out of the picture. However, that could not be guaranteed, and in that case he would rather be the one to inform her of his involvement, to avoid any potential surprises in the future.
**"Great. I´ll look into it at once. And you have my word that she will be alive to make the payment. Just out of curiosity, what numbers are we talking here? I find that the amount of credits owed is usually directly proportional to the amount of encouragement they need to be convinced to make right"**
Leaving the Wookies shop, the assassin droid began to search for information on Saricia. His usual network of contacts didn´t stretch this far out on the Rim, so he had to do it the old fashioned way. Still, years of work had taught him to notice who knew something and who didn´t. And his advanced sensory equipment made him very apt at picking up random comments made in response to someone hearing him make an inquiry.
((
So, I´ll make a Gather Information check to try and find out where she is hiding. I don´t know if I have enough credits to make any possible costs, but I can haggle decently well. Too bad there´s no way of using intimidation in this context RAW.

The Zeltron looks at Arriaddik, who nods, and replies: "**The total sum owed is 57, 823 credits.**"
Surge takes his leave and begins to search for any information as to Naabrea's whereabouts. He's able to pick up all manner of rumors and other data that would have been valuable under other circumstances but which are worthless at present. After only an hour Surge overhears a pair of Trandoshans entering a non-descript shop.
"**Do not worry brother, that ssstupid Wookie will never find her. Arriaddikk is a fool if he thinks he can outsmart usss.**"
"**Well said brother, but I believe he is a fool *nonethelesss!***"
They exchange what passes for a Trandoshan laugh and enter the building by entering the security code - which Surge promptly stores for later use. Inside are a number of other beings, all armed with nothing smaller than blaster rifles, enjoying drinks at the bar and tables scattered across the main room. There's no sign to indicate it's a cantina but that's the closest approximation of what's going on within. The two Dosh in particular take a seat in a backroom where games of Sabacc are being played. Structural analysis of the building indicates a rear entrance to the main room, closer to the Sabacc tables, but the reinforced walls and lack of any sizeable window make any other avenues of approach considerably more difficult. Neither door appears to be guarded.

Surge hangs around the building for a few minutes, completing his scan of the place, and considering his possible course of actions. Heat signatures showed multiple beings inside, and he was able to follow the Trandoshans path clearly, given he cold-blooded nature of the reptilians. As they settled down, the droid reached into his chassis and pulled out an old and worn restraining bolt, and attached it to his chassis. He was not certain exactly what kind of establishment was waiting for him inside, but he figured that going in cautiously might be a good idea. He entered the code, and walked inside the building.

The scene before Surge is mostly what he expected, with a few notable exceptions. There are a couple more individuals than he had estimated that appear to be wearing some sort of dark-colored sensor masking suits. Surge is familiar with Shadowskin and Reflec technology but also knows how expensive it can be. Certainly this is no ordinary cantina. What passes for a bar is attended by an aged but hospitable-looking Ryn. His extroverted nature is accentuated by his cybernetics - his left arm and eye are mechanical and not disguised in any way. There don't appear to be any other droids in the building - restraining bolts or no.
The nearby chatter dies down noticeably as the droid assassin enters, and the closer patrons aren't afraid to glare at this newcomer - their disdain clear. The barkeeper puts down a glass and addresses Surge in a cool tone:
"**Can I help you, friend?**"

As he enters the establishment, the droid assasin looks around, and takes note of the many looks given to him. He can´t tell if it´s because of some general like of droids (or just newcomers), or if they might know of his reputation, but he still decides this is not a good place to lower ones guard just yet.
He doesn´t make an effort to appear intimidating - but also not in any way intimidated - as he settles on keeping the mood just as it is...tense and hostile, but still under control. When spoken to, he turns towards the barkeep.

All eyes follow Surge as he makes his way to the counter. His question seems to change the mood slightly, though whether it's because no one believes droids have a real shot at winning or because they're glad he isn't looking for them isn't clear.

Looking around, he tries to locate the table where the two Trandoshans were sitting - or the one closest to them, if they weren´t playing. He wasn´t in any way programmed for gambling, but he was quite aware of the fact that in many ways Sabacc was as much about reading his opponent as it was about playing the cards you were dealt. And with the kind of sensor apparatus he was carrying, he could probably outweigh his lacking skill with the latter by overcompensating in the former.

Surge can't quite reach a conclusion on the matter but is certain they are either not telling him everything. Whether it's just distrust of strangers or something more, he can't yet discern.

I'll keep it to just you three and a droid dealer for now. I have no idea how the game works either, remember? ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif) And I'll take your roll for this round and then you can roll for yourself. I rolled for you for the first round.

**"She must have held a great debt indeed, if you were willing to settle for half of it as payment. I would expect the services of skilled people like yourself don´t come cheap"**
Looking at the cards dealt him, the droid assassin played his hand casually, not really interested in the game, but more about the information the two would be slipping.
**"Still, if it was me, I´d be a bit concerned about crossing a Wookie. From what I´ve heard, they are quite fierce and short-tempered, and I wouldn´t hold it for impossible that one would consider extracting some revenge on the two of you. But maybe I am just prejudiced since Wookies have a reputation for tearing the arms off of droids"**
Playing out his last card of the round, he looked at the two and his voice became a bit more musing.
**"But of course, I would expect your arms to be even less firmly attached than mine…"**
