# [Into the Unknown] Chapter One

### **Alicia** (2010-10-05 17:03:40)

The Consular-class cruiser the *Errant Voyager* orbits the temperate world of Altiria or depending on who you ask, Anarris. Being the last stop before exploring the unknown expanse of the Unknown Regions, you have traveled down to the capital city of Rastar in the shuttle to pick the last of some needed supplies.
The city of Rastar is strategically placed at the back of a large harbor on the east coast of the western continent. The structures are prosaic, each part of the building serving some purpose; not a single area of the structure unused. Even the exteriors play a role with each building colored according to the function it serves in society. The spaceport of Rastar rests at the edge of the city away from the harbor.
Here the Duros pilot relaxes against the hull of the shuttle as she watches the bulk hauler droid transport the cargo on board and stifles her yawns of boredom. It's been a long day as you all did your parts in securing the supplies and enjoying the city in your own ways. The militaristic Anarrians have been friendly to the off worlders, boasting about their people and continent as they display wares and tell stories of their people's triumphs.

Bran holds the saddle loosely with his knees as Ferro bounds about the spaceport. His trust in the Varg is unshakable despite the beasts jumping and frolicking before launching itself across the breadth of the large area at top speed. The grin on Bran's face is broad and easy, seeming a boy again despite his twenty-four years.
**"Gadewch i ni fynd! Neidio!"** he calls into the Varg's ear, coaxing it to leap the loading droid, landing in a coiled bunch of muscle and fur on the other side. As Ferro springs on Bran's head whips back in laughter, reveling in the freedom of their movement. Bran leans forward and hunches over the saddle, taking good handfuls of fur, **"Yn gryno yn awr, yn gwneud frys!"**
As Ferro reaches his top speed Bran hold ons tightly. A speeder may be much faster and smoother, but no speeder can track a *marie lwyd* across the frozen tundra, or stalk a *cnofilod* through its native habitat. No speeder can carry its wounded rider back to safety, or fight by his side. No speeder is a faithful and loving friend and ally.
**"Iawn, yn ddigon chwarae. Mae bron amser i fynd,"** he whispers to the Varg as it wheels around and trots back towards the shuttle winded and grinning its own toothy grin, having enjoyed the chance to stretch and play. Bran leaps from the saddle with ease as Ferro races past the loading droid, almost tipping it when he brushes against it. **"Byddwch yn ofalus!"** he calls after the playful beast as it bounds further into the shuttle.
**"Almost ready are we?"** he asks the pilot as he crosses his arms and leans against the hull with him, turning to look for the others.

### **Blackhat** (2010-10-05 21:53:56)

'**Our journeys beginnings are just as fantastical and mysterious to me as what assuredly awaits us in the Unknown,'** Dard Onnirr narrates into his palm while taking images of architecture in the distance and purposely shaky footage of any native who appears enigmatic in the least bit. **'Though cryptic and incomprehensible, I cannot help but feel the seeds of a boy-like wonder start to creep through my very bones as I gaze upon this civilization and it's welcoming inhabitants. There is no doubt in my soul that there is much much more of this to come on the journey ahead of us.'**
Standing there in the street, amongst the traders who had earlier attempted to fill the many pockets on his vest with their own trinkets, he cannot shake the preoccupation that now grips him. Pocketing the videocorder, he pulled another device from a lower pocket marked with a smiley face and raised it to his face. **'Note to self: take out the "to me" part, muffle the background noise, and actually find out if this place is general knowledge or not. Brighten up the market stuff too, and cut out the cultural discussions and use whichever war story sounds the most oppressive and vague. Gotta preserve the aesthetics.'** Tilting his head in thought, he raises it again. **'Oh and get approach footage to the ship but mud it up later.'**
Content with himself, he slides his hands into his pockets and keeps walking, looking upwards at the sprawling city as he looks for somewhere high with an open view, hoping to be able to get some stills and distant-motion shots down at the shuttle before they're called to leave. Nodding and giving various universal signs of respect to everyone he passes as he wanders, there is the snagging doubt that maybe this won't be a catastrophe after all. However, that doubt is immediately snuffed out by the inscrutable fact of tragedy selling better than victory. ***'I'm sure someone will be shot soon enough,'*** he reassures himself.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-10-06 13:45:45)

Pyar stands near the ship, not far from Kalazyni Burr and the loading droid Sigma, arms crossed across his chest. He has spent almost all his time in and around the ship, excepting occasions where he has escorted other members of the crew: the old warrior is taking his duties as ranking security officer seriously.
He watches Bran bounding around the area on his great beast with an expression of mild disapproval. Truthfully, it is the animal itself the Iron Knight disapproves of: he has encountered all manner of alien diseases and infections throughout his long career, and he remembers several instance when the ailments had been carried aboard unsuspected by pets.
He understands the potential value of the creature, of course. Riding Ferro, Bran can scout out areas that even a speeder would struggle within. But there should be some form of quarantine procedure in place...
Ah well. He will just have to trust in the mysterious talents of their medical officer, the Jedi Healer Damaya Tadro, should the Varg carry any killer parasites onboard.
The Iron Knight strokes his silver-black beard thoughtfully, then hails his security team over comms.
'Report in,' he commands.
According to their assignments Jarros should be escorting the Jedi Jonas Kalvar, while Karros is playing escort to the medical officer. Krieger, he has on special duty: following the so-called "journalist" Dard Onnirr. Indesqu has a healthy amount of distrust for the man, not helped by his asking some rather tactless questions about Pyar's time captaining the Paladins unit and the circumstances leading to his "fall from grace" and current assignment. They went unanswered, of course. Pyar has an idea that the jorunalist would actually prefer for the mission to end a disaster, since it will make a better story. Perhaps enough to deliberately sabotage it? Maybe he is simply being paranoid. On the other hand, suspecting the worst in a situation has kept him alive more times than he can count.

## Architecture 101

### **Parmenter** (2010-10-07 23:40:09)

**"Ooo, marvelous architecture, though a bit bland."** Jeic says, looking at distant structures through his electrobinoculars. Perched atop the shuttle he is enjoying some of the finer things Rastar has to offer, namely food and a rich architectural view. **"The city seems well laid out too, interesting."**
Jeic had spent the morning carefully selecting parts and components that he felt could be trusted. And now that his role was completed, he was enjoying their last stop of known civilization before they moved into the unknown. Holding the binoculars with one hand his other dropped to the bag of nuts he had purchased in the city. The loud crunch of them serving to cover up the sound of Sigma loading the shuttle, and the beast jumping around the landing pad.
Turning in his chair, he lends his view to the harbor and all the riches it holds. **"Boats."** He says to himself. **"I've never built a boat before. They seem awkward and clunky compared to a repulsor vehicle. Though, given the nature of these beings, I'd be hesitant to help them advance their technology. No telling what chaos they could wreak in the stars."**
Removing his specs, he glances down at the landing pad. The others are milling about in their own ways, waiting for Sigma to finish loading the shuttle. Covering his eyes he looks toward the system's star, **"Yep, I think that's enough daylight for today."** He grabs his chair and food, then carefully climbs down to the landing pad and packs his things in the shuttle.

### **Alicia** (2010-10-14 15:56:58)

Kalazyni opens an eye to glance at Bran as he addresses her, before closing it again in her boredom. "**Soon as that tin can finishes loading the supplies**," she responds. The bulk loader in question continues its duties as it picks up and stacks a few crates before taking them onto the shuttle. The assortment of crates has been dwindling remarkably with maybe a little over a half dozen left before the droid finishes completely.
Pyar receives back mixed reports from his security team, but all of them continue to escort their respective charges. Karros reports Jedi Kalvar has been in negotiations with representatives of the Anarrians, who are apparently trying to swindle the Jedi out of an accurate map of the surrounding systems. The Jedi Healer, Damaya Tadro, has been wandering the marketplace and visiting various clinics, Jarros reports though doesn't go into specifics. Krieger, as ordered, has been keeping a sharp eye on the journalist and has been keeping the Iron Knight updated on his charge's activities over the course of their visit.
Those outside the ship, watching the hubbub of the spaceport notice an increase in the amount of security patrols roaming the area. One of these patrols approaches Pyar, being the closest to them and an officer presents a hologram of a young child, the boy being no more than seven years old. The child in the hologram is covered in chocolate-brown fur and wearing a dark blue jumpsuit. "Have you seen this child?" the Anarrian asks, his blonde fur bristling.
*************************************
Following behind the journalist as he pokes about the city for a story, Krieger, the journalists security escort, steps up beside him. "**We should be heading back.**" he says decisively with no hint of there being an alternative. With the sun setting, the residents have been heading home themselves, eager to find a good meal or some other entertainment from the privacy of their home. Vestiges of merchants try to sell their wares to the stragglers but are soon closing up their shop to head home themselves.

## Re: Chapter One

### **simplyscribed** (2010-10-14 19:53:36)

Pyar does the Anarrian the courtesy of examining the hologram carefully before replying.
'I apologise, but I have not seen the child,' he says, his expression suitably grave, 'but wait one moment, please.'
He knows that it is a waste of time to ask his security team if they have seen the youth, and he also knows any attempt to be kind will benefit no one in the long run; yet Pyar finds he cannot let the native go without knowing he has done everything within his power to help. His pride as the Iron Knight demands he perform at his best, and he remembers still the dreams he had when he first signed up for service: dreams in which the children of the Galaxy were safe from harm.
Eyes on the hologram, he opens up comms to his team once again.
'This is Gaffer,' he states, 'Errant Guard, report in. The locals are looking for a missing child, looks to be very young, perhaps less than seven. The hologram shows him with brown fur... chocolate. He is in a dark blue jumpsuit. Have any of you seen the boy?'

### **Magical2099** (2010-10-15 02:27:06)

Bran perks up at the patrol's and security captain's conversation. He kicks off from the hull and walks over. **"Missing child? Do you have any personal items of the child's? Something that holds scent, like clothing?"** he asks before turning to the security captain, **"If they do, we've still got fifteen to twenty before the droid is done, I could help them out. What do you say CSO?"**
*Small children always hurt the worst when in trouble. Many hearts 'a broken. Can't hurt to help, can it? Besides, Ferro and I can track anything,* he thinks as he waits for replies from both men.

## Re: Chapter One

### **Blackhat** (2010-10-15 03:08:21)

Dard Onnirr nods his agreement and continues to walk towards the raised building he had picked out, hopefully holding a vantage point to the shuttle he could do something with. He had found that capturing his own imaged has made his work easier so far, and could not possibly justify his rampant use of stock footage up to this point. "**Though I have yet to really get to know you, Mr. Kreiger, I'd like to think you are not one to mince words. So while you say you *think* we should head back I have no reason not to think there is a slight bit of uncertainty on the fact so a few moments to finish the meaningful task I have now set myself upon, followed by an expedient return to our conveyance, does not seem entirely out of the question now does it?**" He has been careful to move swiftly as he speaks in order to minimize the distance to the structure he is now gesturing towards with an open hand to emphasize his point.

## Re: Chapter One

### **Alicia** (2010-10-19 23:34:01)

The team of Anarrian security glance at each other and speak in their native tongue in low whispers, conferring on the questions Bran brings up. One turns, leaving toward one of the other groups. "**We have nothing but the child's image,**" says their leader as he clicks the holo image off.
Over Pyar's comes all but Kreiger report in that they haven't seen a child matching that specific description, though the also mention they hadn't exactly been paying close attention for such a child. Indicating they will keep an eye out for the missing child, they report they are on their way back with their charges.
********************************
Krieger eyes the journalist with a look indication he wasn't amused. "**Where in 'we should head back' did you find *think* uttered,**" he says, moving surprisingly quickly to block Dard's progress to the building, blocking the door. "**I'll restate for less confusion: we are heading back now.**" Indicating with his hand, Krieger motions for Dard to continue down the street in the direction they need to go for the space port.

## Re: Chapter One

### **Blackhat** (2010-10-20 03:46:14)

Smiling broadly and halting awkwardly to prevent an embarrassing collision with Mr. Krieger, Dard Onnirr raises his hands in mock surrender and allowed himself to be ushered back from whence he came, all the more knowledgeable about his companion. "**Of course, merely a reasonably suggestion. You surely can't blame me for hoping that a man such as yourself would have the common flaw of doubting exactly what it had been that you previously stated after being encouraged to follow a series of articulate and expediated statements on the subject.**"
Dard was rather more convinced that his would-be Warden couldn't, as he would have absolutely no need to, converse in such a way. He was more likely experienced in gleaning the rough idea of what a person like Dard was attempting to get across wrapped up in the needlessly elaborate wording. As his more casual communication with the crew and travelers he had already met had seemed to be rife with misunderstanding and baseless aggression, and he had very little personal interest in disarming himself of lingual habits developed as a benefit in his profession, there were undeniable drawbacks to having someone on hand to divine his meaning to his lessers even if his own social skills were tapered around the barely-present needs of his practice.
"**After all,**" he commented after a few moments sounding all too proud of himself, "**clarity is the key to communication.**"

### **simplyscribed** (2010-10-21 11:32:34)

'Looks like you won't be able to help,' Pyar tells Bran, 'unless that beast of yours can remember holos.'
The grizzled war veteran receives the replies of his security team with an air of resignation. Of course they won't have noticed the child, even if he previously ran in front of them. Nevertheless, one of the team has yet to reply. Somehow it isn't surprising that it would be Krieger, particularly given the troublesome nature of the man's charge.
'Krieger,' he calls out, 'I repeat: this is Gaffer. Report in.'

**"Ferro can track anything, it would simply be faster if we had an article that held a scent,"** Bran replies to the Security Chief. He eyes the now blank hologram, seeing a challenge in this hunt.
**"My apologies Anarrian but I fear I won't be able to help you. We seem to be on a tight schedule,"** he tells the native security, the regret obvious in his voice. **"Best of luck, and good hunting,"** he tells them as he withdraws a short distance, looking for a high vantage point from which to view the surrounding area.

## Re: Chapter One

### **Parmenter** (2010-10-24 12:42:14)

Jeic exits the shuttle to catch the tail end of a conversation in progress. *A child is missing?* Looking to their pilot, Jeic asks, **"Excuse me, miss, how long till we're expected back on the ship?"** To the rest present, he raises his voice clearly in favor of helping the natives. **"Surely, we could take a little time to show the Anarrian's that we are not the kind of people to leave while a child might be in danger."**
With a quick step he joins the project's scout, and the Anarrians. **"Could I see the image please? I'd like to help in the search if there are no objections."** His comment intended for his own head of security.

---

## Re: Chapter One

### **simplyscribed** (2010-10-24 14:22:31)

The Gaffer barely prevents a sigh escaping from his lips. Krieger yet to report back, and all the mission's staff now apparently interested in a local affair, as though a missing child was anything unusual.
'I sympathise for the plight of the child,' Pyar responds to Jeic's implied query, 'but my own priority is to keep the crew and passengers of the *Errant Voyager* safe. Which is difficult enough to do when members of our number insist on separating when we reach ports, and will become more difficult still if we start modifying our schedule to try and heroically right every wrong we encounter on our journey across the space lanes.'
He turns his brown eyes on the Anarrian security team. There is empathy there (as indeed it has been etched across his features since learning of their search) but also a hardness.
'I'm sure my counterparts among this security team understand the choice I am forced to make, as no doubt they would prioritise the protection of their own in a reversed scenario. So I will have to say "no". If you want to delay our departure and assist in the search efforts, then you'll have to go over my head and persuade Kalvar.'
The security officer turns his attention to Bran.
'However,' he tells the scout, 'I'm getting no response from Security Officer Krieger. I would appreciate if you and Ferro could locate him and the reporter. Perhaps you might be lucky enough to locate the child while doing so.'

## Re: Chapter One

### **Alicia** (2010-10-29 12:34:06)

Krieger seems to let the journalists words slide over him as he half walks down the road, his eyes scanning the area, communicating not for the first time in the last fifteen minutes into his comm. The words coming out indistinct to Dard as the soldier relays something to the security head. His pace hardly slowing he seems to be quite adequate at talking and walking at the same time.
"**Sorry, sir.**" Krieger says over the comm to gaffer. "**We're on our way back now. I'll keep a lookout for the child.**"
----------------------------------
The Anarrian security team begins to move off to the next group of travelers undeterred in their quest to learn what they can. The bulk loader, Sigma, picks up the last of the crates to haul in and remains inside, its task completed. The bored Rodian, follows behind, eager to get back into the pilot's seat.
The only high point in the bay Bran could access would be to climb up on his own shuttle, not an impossible feat with small rungs set into the hull to aid technicians in their repair work. From his vantage Bran can spot the teams Jedi leader Kalvar with his Zabrak escort, Jarros making his way back. Not far behind him is the Miralukan Jedi Healer, Damaya and Jarros's twin, Karros.
After a few more minutes, even Gaffer can see the groups approaching in the distance.

***Potatoes.***
Krieger thought to himself as he escorts Onnir through the streets and to the spaceport. Something about journalists always made the mercenary think of root vegetables, and as they wound their way through the Anarrian city, Krieger spares a quick glance over his shoulder for his charge.
***He don't look particularly* starch-y *to me.***
Frowning to himself, Krieger's eyes alertly scan every facet of the Anarrian cityscape as the spaceport comes into view. Perhaps journalists were akin to root vegetables in a more metaphysical sense, he thinks. It could be that the potato stood for how well rooted the profession happened to be, and how bland and waxy it was, inside and out, until properly seasoned and mixed with butter.
***…Although if I were a hyper-intelligent spud***, he thought, ***that's exactly what I'd want other people to think***.
**"Hey, news… teller… guy… If I were to, lessay, throw you in a pot of hot water- boiling water ya know? - Would you leave'a waxy broth?"**
Krieger suddenly blurts out after they've gained the spaceports entrance and the soldier leads the reporter over toward Gaffer. He just as suddenly rounds on Onnir, the Iron Knight at his back and the whole damn Intelligent Potato conspiracy right in front of him.
**"Ya know, a kind'ofa  *Starch-y* build-up, ya might say?"**
Leaning forward, the mercenary is all toothsome smile and menace. Although his arms are triumphantly folded across his chest, Krieger stands ready to peel Onnir should things get out of hand once the conspiracy is revealed.

## Re: Chapter One

### **Blackhat** (2010-10-31 18:59:47)

It was a testament to his experience and general control of his impulses that the line of questioning presented by Mr Kreiger did not cause his brain to turn off for a few moments in order to properly verify the information it had received with the rest of his body in a "Wait... what?" kind of moment. This was not only an unexpected question, but from a purely provocational view he was utterly lost as to what kind of response Kaz was attempting to elicit from him. With the genuine nature of the statement being unable to be properly accessed in the first second or so after it was said, Dard Onnirr had no choice but to go the obvious and practical route in order to answer the mans oddly thought-provoking questions.
Looking Mr. Kreiger in the currently-offputting face for a moment before looking upwards ponderously with his hand thoughtfully stroking his chin, Dard replies, **"As I'm not a scientist, or a qualified medical professional of any degree, I can only surmise. But water that hot is going to be killing all my cells and throwing off homeostasis of many of the bodies processes. Obviously it's safe to assume some pretty extreme pain, perhaps enough to make me pass out. I'd have trouble breathing, because of factors such as steam, the air in my lungs being far too hot and losing muscle control as my cells died and chemical processes are thrown off. I'm sure it wouldn't be long before my heart lost the ability to beat, again due to heating up chemicals needed to create muscle contraction, as well as general cell death. The brain cannot function long without oxygen, and I'm sure it wouldn't take long before it would be no longer receiving oxygen properly due to blood heating up and muscle problems… so I'd ballpark you would be dead in under 10 minutes and unconscious considerably before that. As far as the residue I'd leave behind, I'm sure there is someone on the ship we could consult with in order to satisfy your unorthodox conundrum. Otherwise, there's only one way to find out."**

## Re: Chapter One

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-02 14:19:35)

As Dard and Krieger come within auditory range and Gaffer catches the tail end of the conversation, Pyar expels a sharp breath. Obviously Krieger has had another one of his "moments".
Pyar has often wondered how exactly Krieger qualified for a place on a exploratory-cum-diplomatic mission. Admittedly despite his obvious mental instabilities it isn't in question that he'll be a good man to have around in a fight. In that area at least his records are exemplary, if demonstrating unfortunately savage tendencies.
The Iron Knight is forced once more to acknowledge he isn't leading Pyar's Paladins anymore: he doesn't have the luxury of the cream of the crop. No. He gets the scum from the bucket. He gets Krieger.
'You're very almost late Onnirr,' he reprimands the reporter, hoping his direct intervention will stop the pair's conversation short of whatever unfortunate direction it previously headed, 'it's time you realised that this voyage is not your personal pleasure cruise. We have schedules, and we keep to them. Your presence at our departure is strictly optional, I can assure you.'

The Jedi, laden with small satchels of purchases, board the transport upon arriving. Kalvar not looking very happy about how his meeting with the Anarrians went. The Zabrak twins stay out by the ramp, waiting for any further orders from Gaffer. They chat quietly to each other in that strange way they have of finishing each other's thoughts.
From inside, Kalazyni calls out to the others still lingering outside the ship. "**You ready to go? What's the hold up?**"
Karros at this looks up Pyar, amusement crossing her face at the impatience of their Duros pilot.

## Re: Chapter One

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-03 22:59:35)

Pyar's eyes flicker aside to watch the Jedi pass, and he acknowledges his two Zabrak staff with a quick nod.
His lips twitch upward at the corners at Kalazyni's impatient shout. He, too, will be happy to leave port, so for once his desires are perfectly in accord with those of the pilot. She wants to get back to doing what she loves, and he wants his job to be easier: far simpler to keep this bunch under control when confined to a starship.
Noticing Karros looking at him, he responds to her with a quick smile, then turns his attention back to Dard.
'Well? Up the ramp with you.'

With everything loaded, Jeic spends a few minutes strapping in Sigma. *Never know when the artificial gravity might give out, and this loader is older than I am.*
With his friend tucked away in the cargo hold, Jeic joins the rest of the shuttles occupants toward the front. Taking his seat he informs the others, **"Sigma is buckled in, as am I. Ready whenever you are."**,

Knowing the moment has slipped away with Gaffer's interference, Kaz waits until the old soldier is between him and Onnir, but with Pyar's back to him. He then points his index and middle finger at his eyes, and then his pointer at the journalist in the universal symbol of "Eeeh... I've got my eye on you, buddy."
***Ain't no smarty-ass spud going to catch me offguard, no sir! Not like last time! Fool me five times, shame on you! Fool me six times… Or wait, is it the other way around? Isn't there something about a bird in a bush in there? Six bush-birds, and you're a fool? Wha…***
The half-cocked mercenary wanders up the boarding ramp past both Gaffer and Onnir, deep in thought, although he does spare a moment to glancingly shoulder-charge the journalist, just to let him know that he is there.

## Re: Chapter One

### **Blackhat** (2010-11-04 21:37:43)

Raising his hands in mock surrender, Dard Onnirr resigned himself to doing as instructed rather than vociferously defending his tardiness in the spirit of journalistic exploration. **"Remind me to digitally add a sense of humour to you in post-production,"** he says in all manner of seriousness as he gives Mr. Krieger one last bemused stare and, feeling quite giddy all-things-considered, extrudes his tongue towards Kaz in response to his warning gesture as he ducks his head out of habit as he enters the shuttle. The obviously irritated expressions on the crew's face prompts Dard to jerk his thumb in the direction of Mr. Indesqu with an expression akin to saying 'Pfft, some people huh?' in a reactionary attempt to poke fun at the probable reality of himself being the source of their ire. It goes as well as could be expected.
Plopping himself deliberately down right next to Jeic Tronnh, one of the few members of the expedition he had yet to ingratiate himself to with intended prompt, he begins to sort through his equipment and glancing over what he'd covered while planet-side. **"So Mr. Tronnh,"** he begins without even looking up from his task, **"why don't you tell me a little about yourself on the way to our home away from home? I think a good place to start would be doing your best to describe how a fight between yourself and say… that critter Bran is so justifiably fond of, and from there we can discuss in your own words what brought you here in the first place."** Aside from his unwillingness to look the Zabrak in the eye while reading lines of text on a datapad, the fact that Dard is casually pointing an audiocorder in the general direction of Jeic seems to strongly imply that he is merely interested in being talked at.

### **Magical2099** (2010-11-05 02:57:09)

Finding nothing from his perch Bran clambers down and makes his way on board, ignoring the odd semi-confrontation between the merc and the journalist. *Not my issue,* he thinks as he boards and heads for the corner of the cargo hold to sit leaning against Ferro, waiting for take off.
*I wonder if I'll be forced to cook again. So far none of this lot can manage 'potable,'* he thinks before reaching up to scratch at Ferro's ear. The Varg turning his head and nudging him hard enough to roll him across the floor catches him by surprise and he stands, **"So, still feeling rambunctious huh?"** He launches himself across the hold to land on the Varg, engaging in a loosing battle of wrestling far outside his weight class.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-05 07:17:17)

Coinciding with Jeic's attention to Sigma, Pyar conducts one last quick sweep of the shuttle's exterior with the aid of the Zabraki twins, to see for himself if everything seems in order. As far as he knows no one has been able to get anywhere near the it unnoticed, but in his experience a little paranoia is healthy. Plus a desirable quality in the person entrusted with keeping everyone alive and safe.
'Well, it *looks* clean,' he finally confirms, 'so that's that. Let's get on board and buckle up.'
Gesturing for the pair to follow him, Pyar strides up the shuttle's boarding ramp. Inside, he finds any available seat and properly buckles in, the belts adjusting automatically to the correct length for security without undue discomfort.
'We're green,' he states for the benefit of their expedition leader and pilot.
Then, in anticipation of launch, he closes his eyes. This is one instance where his brief to protect the crew is not in effect, since the shuttle's lift-off is all in Kalazyni's thankfully capable hands. Feeling himself relax for the first time since leaving the *Errant Voyager* in orbit of Altiria, the Gaffer allows himself this indulgence. His other senses remain alert. Just in case.

The Jedi Kalvar and Damaya have already secured their belongings and have strapped themselves into the passenger seating of the shuttle, their heads bowed in quiet conversation as they wait for the others to secure themselves and for the trip to the cruiser to be over. Kalvar does, however, look up when Pyar enters to fasten himself in, but his question of whether everything was ready was belayed by Pyar's declaration.<div style="text-align: right;">
![Radiant7_negvv.jpg](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080912035747/starwars/images/d/d3/Radiant7_negvv.jpg)
</div>

The Duros pilot at the all clear signal, gives a small whoop and begins the final launch preparations. As the Zabraki twins make their way into the seating area to strap in, Kalazyni has already finished warming up the engines, but with a glance backwards she has the foresight to make sure all her passengers were secured before making the ascent. It isn't long though till the ship is sharply, yet smoothly making it's way toward the *Errant Voyager* in orbit. Very soon the sight of the orange vessel disctinct to the Consular-class cruiser is within view of the cockpit's viewports.
Lasting only a few minutes, the trip was uneventful and soon enough the shuttle is touching down in the specially designed hanger bay set into the saloon pod. As the shuttle sets down the wings begin to fold up, moving into its at rest position. Safely on the deck, Kalvar is among the first to unsnap the restraints, stretching slightly as he stands.
"**We'll be jumping into hyperspace in ten minutes. Please make sure everything is secure,**" he says to those gathered. He waits a few minutes for any questions before moving to disembark and head toward the bridge.

'How did the meeting go?' asks the Chief Security Officer, after emerging from the shuttle and looking happily around at the deck.
He briefly wonders where the Healer Damaya went during the period of land stay, and resolves to ask Karros later on when he gets the chance.

### **Alicia** (2010-11-08 20:16:14)

Interrupted by Pyar's question, Kalvar turns back to answer, though it's apparent from his expression that whatever the result was, he wasn't happy about it. "**They may be eagerly hospitable to outsiders, but they are ruthless negotiators.**" From his robes he pulls out a small chip. "**I was able to get the maps. However, for far more than I had intended.**" He gives his security chief a nod of farewell before he turns to be on his way.
The Zabrak twins begin to help in the process of off loading since their guard duties on the planet are no longer in effect, while the Duros pilot finishes up the lock up procedures of the shuttle. Following behind Kalvar, the Mirulakan healer follows behind with her bundle of goods heading deeper into the ship, presumably either to her quarters or the medbay.

Pyar chuckles to himself as the Jedi Knight walks away. He has fought alongside Jedi before and has seen for himself how well they can do battle, but he has always wondered whether they are also as good at manipulating thought as the stories say. Apparently the Annarians, at least, have the willpower to resist such mind tricks.
In a good mood, the Gaffer looks around the interior of the shuttle bay. There are many things about being the Iron Knight he does not and will never miss, but spending time on ships such as this goes firmly on the positive list. He has missed getting to know comrades and crew, forming powerful bonds while confined in the narrow corridors of a starship's interior. And now he has a chance to do it again.
Pyar resolves to send Judicial Agent Delhua a holo expressing his thanks for the posting. He smirks at the thought of her getting excited over such a message, assuming her real plan is bearing fruit... Oh yes, he knows this is meant to lure him back to the Judicial Fleet. You don't get to be as old as Pyar is in his chosen career without being able to spot so transparent a ruse.
Still, the game is kind of fun.
Smiling, Pyar approaches the twins.
'Need help?' he jovially asks.

Momentarily checking the pockets of his vest for anything missing, Dard makes his way out of the confines of the shuttle and stretches his arms while making note of Jedi Kalvan's haste to get to the bridge and their Security Chief's change in attitude. It would seem that he finds the ship more agreeable to his mood, though a smile definitely not being agreeable with his face.
Nodding in acknowledgment to those who look his way, whether they return it or not, he commits to have a meaningful discussion with both the Commander and Jedi Trado concerning some small matters relevant to his interests. Feeling his pursuit of these things to probably be considered unwelcome while the crew makes ready to make the jump to lightspeed, but still wishing to start as soon as possible, he decides to follow the Commander's example and head to the bridge while taking stock footage of the corridors.
"**Bet the kid's hiding in the shuttle…**" he mutters to himself, barely even conscious of doing so.

Jeic looks at the journalist as he is asked the absurd question. **"A fight between me and his Varg? Where ever would you get an idea like that?"** Jeic continues, offended that Dard seems to not be paying attention one way or the other. **"I'll admit animals are a bit wild for my tastes, unlike machines which have a purpose and attend to it without question."**
Jeic enjoys the rush of flying as they leave the planets gravity. However, it quickly passes once they move into orbit toward the Voyager.
Landing is thoroughly uneventful, other than the conversations that spring up upon arrival. Jeic lends a hand unloading the provisions they'd acquired planet-side. An attempt to show that he's not just a weak man of academia.

The Zabrak twins, in the middle of one of their numerous emphatic debates look up in the course of their work of transferring the cargo from the shuttles hold to the *Errant Voyager*'s. Already put to work, Sigma is already in the process of loading up a set of crates to be carried to the main hold.
There's a chorus of "**Sure**" (from Karros), "**Nah**, (from Jarros)" from the two in response to Pyar's question. The two seem to glare at each other for a moment before they respond in tandem, "**We could use the help,**" and "**It's not necessary.**" Turning away from each other they get back to their respective tasks, leaving it up to the older Human to make up his mind.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The bridge is a hubub of activity as Tsu Tyrell, the Aleena head pilot, and Kalvar convene with a couple of the other specialists on board in determining the next leg of their journey. They hover over a holoprojection of the next system, using the maps Kalvar had requisitioned from the Anarrian people. One of the Human specialists points emphatically at a small cluster, apparently relatively unexplored, while another indicates another. Kalvar looks between the two and then seems to choose another, a system in close proximity to the two the specialists had chosen. Appeased the two specialist go their separate ways as the pilot and Jedi commander prepare for the jump.

Pyar's lips twitch again at the twins' ridiculous behaviour.

That decided, he takes a heavy box from the female Zabrak.
'And in that case I can help you by taking the heavier stuff off your hands.'

Bran takes his time rigging several crates on repulser pads and then lashing them to Ferro's saddle. **"Araf nawr, hawdd,"** he tells the Varg before letting it make it's way off the ship. He then hefts a smaller crate on his shoulder and grabs his carryall and makes his own way down the ramp looking around to find where to drop the recently acquired supplies. Ferro makes his way past the Iron Knight and the twins slowly and carefully but seeming to ignore them, knowing how some people react when he is obviously paying attention to them.

Karros grins at Pyar as he goes about helping her to move the heavier crates she doesn't have the strength to. Soon enough, everything has been transfered from the shuttles hold and secured in the main hold of the *Errant Voyager*. The ten minutes has passed quickly and soon enough Jedi Kalvar's voice can be heard over the internal comm. "***Prepare for the jump to lightspeed.***"
Nodding her thanks to the gaffer, Karros follows her brother out of the bay and toward the lounge where they both wait for the jump before digging into some of the food stores.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Activity on the bridge dies down as Kalvar inputs the jump coordinates into the navicomputer and then gives a nod to the Aleena pilot to proceed with the jump. The stars in the viewports elongate as the ship makes the jump and the heavy thrum of the hyperdrive engines to those who listen for it can be heard throughout the ship.

Staying quietly off the side on the bridge, Dard Onnirr is distantly comforted by the professionalism he sees though is realistically unqualified to judge. As the ship is dragged into extra-dimensional space, he is similarly comforted that he stays upright in the archway.
Dard, completely convinced that simply by being out of the way he has already curried some favor with the Commander, eagerly approaches him and clears his throat in order to acquire some portion of his attention. **"If I might have a brief word, Kalvar. Can I call you Kalvar? Fantastic. Now as I was saying, if you could briefly say where we were going, put some time aside in the future to allow me to ask some questions about your dealings with the Anarrian bureaucrats, and give me a copy of the charts you procured as a result for reference. Should that sound satisfactory to you, I'll leave you to it while I consult our medical technician on an area of concern I have recently acquired."** Smiling innocuously, the Journalist holds out his hand more to prompt an acknowledgment of his request in front of witnesses.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-18 20:13:57)

Pyar watches the twins go to the lounge. Seeing no particular reason for his own presence to be felt there or anywhere else on the ship (one of the things he has discovered about working in security on a space transport is that a great deal of the time you're completely superfluous to requirements), he instead returns to his quarters in preparation for the hyperspace jump.
While there, he decides to record a holo intended for Carria Delhua, the woman responsible for his recruitment onto the mission. As the vessel lurches into hyperspace he ponders his words, intending to commit them to record just as soon as they are flying stably once more.

## Re: Chapter One

### **Alicia** (2010-11-18 21:04:44)

Kalvar looks up from charts he was mussing over when Dard inadvertently began asking him questions. "**Mr. Onnirr,**" he starts formally. "**Everything you have just asked me will be available in the public logs once it has been recorded.**" Glancing back down at his work, he adds unperturbed, "**So I don't have to repeat myself, I'm afraid you will just have to wait.**" Not inviting the journalist to linger with further conversation he continues his analysis of the charts.
With the ship safely in hyperspace, the crew of the Errant Voyager goes about their usual business. The specialists linger in the lab, busying themselves in making sure everything is ready and overzealously inventorying the various equipment on hand. Their presences unneeded for the time being, the pilots retire to the lounge where they join the twins in the their merry consumption of the ship's stores. Damaya watches as Jeic's protégé, the Wroonian Azda Rodin, takes apart and puts back together the Jedi healer's assistant, a beaten up GH-7 Medical droid which has obviously seen better days.

### **Magical2099** (2010-11-19 02:23:00)

Other than taking care of his chores quickly and efficiently, Bran spends most of his time in the salon pod where Ferro is quartered. Much like the Varg, much like most animals (especially predators), he sleeps a great deal on the pallet he has made in the Varg's kennel. Beasts use sleep as a way to 'fast forward' or spend their free time. It makes them well rested for the next task and takes up the empty hours between hunting and other basic needs. He leaves his com on so any who need him can find him easily enough. The reasons he makes his camp where is does are simple: he prefers the Varg's company to most others, he is still unfamiliar with the crew and slightly concerned with ignorance bringing them to harm around the beast, and he has spent so much time sleeping rough that beds are simply uncomfortable.
Ferro is incredibly bored with the whole trip, and as such sleeps throughout most of it, save when Bran moves him to clean his kennel and works with him trying to teach him phrases in Basic.

Everything is going about as smoothly as might be expected. Although I know your superiors will be receiving regular progress reports I thought that I would send this one to you personally. It is you, after all, who invited me on this little trip.'
'And for that I thank you. It has been a pleasure to relive some old times and to be back, at least in theory, doing something I do well.'
'Not that I was a bad miner, at that!'

**"Fantastic, I'll await just that then."** Standing at what he assumes is 'Attention' and giving as rigid a salute as he can to the Commander, Dard Onnirr takes the hint and wishes a fond farewell to the bridge crew as he leaves the ship's brain.
Unsure of his orientation, the besmirched Journalist puts his recollection of the ships layout to the test as he starts walking down the corridors, poking his head into rooms. He eventually resorts to actually calling out for the Med bay by name, followed by a whistle he specifically designed to attract it. Apologies are given all around.

It doesn't take Onnirr long to find the medbay as he would thought as the way there is marked by a blue line with arrows on the walls indicating the direction of the emergency center of the ship. The journalist finds the Mirlukan healer, her arms crossed over her chest as she watches the young Wroonian mechanic goes about repairing the healer's droid assistant. "**These things are just dreadful. Why they couldn't give me a living assistant is beyond me,**" she mutters. Then looking up she spots Dard entering. "**Yes?**" she asks looking the human up and down for any injuries, her covered, blind eyes apparently seeing more than Dard would think possible.

After making himself comfortable in the hold, Bran's excericises with Ferro is interrupted by a loud crash, coming from the main hold where not an hour ago, the supplies had been transferred. Stopping to listen, the scout doesn't hear any other noises, almost as if it was just a bad strap failing.

Feeling oddly unnerved by the body check-out, Dard Onnirr momentarily forgets what it was he wanted to accomplish by coming here, instead deciding to try not to stare where her eyes should/might be. Recollection dawning on him as he's greeted, he bows humbly to the Jedi, the other young woman, and the Droid for equality's sake. **"Hey, is this a bad time?"** he asks, looking at the Wroonian and then leaning over the Droid quizzically. **"Seems like the last member of the crew I'd want to go haywire,"** he begins with a smirk as he stands up straight and moves out of the near vicinity of the actual work, **"which is kind of why I'm here, Jedi Tadro. It's not entirely pressing, and I have honestly no idea if your code prohibits the kind of conversation I want to have, but I was wondering if you might have a moment to discuss some medical specifics about a certain member of the expedition."**

He uses hand gestures to point Ferro's path, intending for the Varg to flank round and watch the other side.

Damaya looks back at the droid for a moment, her arms returning to cross over her chest as she does and then her glance moves back to the journalist where it remains. "**Ms. Rodin has it under control.**" The Wroonian for her credit does her best not to giggle loudly.
"**Doctor, I'll take Gev to get him fixed up, right as rain,**" the young woman says, and then turning on power to the droids antigrav units starts to push the floating droid out of the medbay.
The Mirlukan's attention is still on Dard as the young mechanic leaves, "**Speak plainly now, Mr. Onnirr, What is it you want? Has someone become ill?**"

Bran and Ferro move quietly into the darkened bay, each moving around it using the darkness to their advantage looking for the source of the disturbance. Rounding a corner of reinforced shelves, Bran finds the tipped crate, devoid of it's lid and it's contents of ration packs scattered across the floor. Looking closely, the scout notices that some of the packs had been trampled.
Nearby, Ferro let's out a low growl which is followed by a small scream.
Rounding the corner, the sight of the small Anarrian child from the hologram greets the scout. Staring up at the enormous lupine a look of plain terror fills the boys face, caught red-handed by the creature as he munched on the contents of the crate.

**"Now child,"** Bran says, announcing his presence, **" Can you speak Basic? Your people were searching for you. Why have you stowed away?"** Bran asks slowly and gently, following Ferro's example by crouching and placing his elbows on his knees, well away from his belt and weapons.

Tired from his exertions, a common occurrence in his advancing years, Jeic decides to refresh himself with a shower. His cabin was, thankfully, quite near to the landing bay. The walk does give him a moment to call up his assistant, however. **"Az, I'm back, and will be available in a while to grab something to eat, and tell you about Anarris,"** he pauses for a moment to think of something witty, but fails. **"That is to say, if you haven't loss your interest in the ramblings of an old man."**
After a brief wash, he dresses finishing with his communicator and begins the trek to the rear of the ship.

"**I'll be in the repair bay.**" The channel clicks close and as the Zabrak mechanic makes his way down the corridors.

Lan is in his cabin, lost in meditation. He tries to allow his consciousness to expand to feel his connection to the life on the surface, the teeming mass of beings all pursuing their own ends, tries to relax his ego to the point that his mind can encompass all the passions and contradictions of so many lives.
Suddenly something breaks his reverie. Moments ago all he'd felt on board the ship had been the normal emotions of a crew going about their business. Now there was something else, something like a sharp and acrid taste in his mouth...fear. Focusing his mind, he tries to visualize the layout of the ship, to see the fear like a beacon. There...in the cargo bay.
He stands slowly, easing himself out of the trance -- his master always said "act deliberately not impatiently, or else you allow others' fear to cloud your judgment." A deep breath and then he leaves, heading to the cargo bay to investigate.
Arriving in the cargo bay he is surprised to find Bran and Ferro accompanied by a small unknown child alongside a torrent of spilled rations. Looking from one to another he tries to piece together what must have just happened. After nodding to Bran and Ferro he turns his attention to the child.
**My, my that's a lot of rations for one so small. There has to have been better food on the surface…what brings you here?**

Would it make these people feel better if I provided them with waivers that GH's legal department drafted for me before we left?"** His smile diminishes slightly as he removes the device from his chest pocket, holding it in front of him and looking it over carefully as he speaks. **"While I appreciate the warning, and it is natural for you appreciation of this fact to be less than considerable, Jedi Tadro, I'd be lying if I said that my contract concerning this project took into account the possible animosity towards me seemingly overstepping myself.

On an impulse, he slides a datapad awkwardly out on an internal pocket in his vest and plugs an audiocorder into it. Scrolling briefly through the interface, he hits play and his voice reverberates through the durasteel corridors. **"We all have our jobs to do, and I'll work as hard as I have to to ensure the product will reward ten-fold what it costs in patience; I can promise you that."**

The boy, still frightened, watches Ferro for a moment as Bran speaks and then, bravely, holds out his hand to it intending to reach for the spot the scout said the large lupine liked to be scratched. He jumps slightly as Ferro shifts, but hardly deterred the boy reaches out again. The rations forgotten in his hand, the boy scratches the large creature behind the ears with a lopsided grin as Bran relays his message to Pyar.
Distracted, he jumps when the Jedi speaks, unaware that Lan had arrived and had been watching. Pulling his hand away from the mount he looks up in awe at the Jedi as he notices the lightsaber. Stuttering, he finally answers the young knight's question, repeating his response he gave Bran, "**Didn't mean to… I was hungry and didn't want to go home yet.**"

Kalvar confirms he received the message and indicates he will meet Pyar in the lounge just as Pyar enters. Barking his orders, the twins jump to their feet the smiles from their earlier merrymaking with the pilots evaporating under Pyar's dour gaze. "**Stowaway, sir?**" Karros asks, braving a question as Jarros leaves the lounge to retrieve Krieger and head to the hold. The two pilots, not eager to be near the security chief in his current mood, wisely begin to disperse, their voices raising in volume as they resume their conversation in the safety of the hallways.

'You can come if you wish, technician Tronnh,' Pyar had confirmed to Jeic just before leaving engineering, 'perhaps another seasoned head will help expedite our search for a solution to this problem.'

---

Pyar's glower falls on Karros as she asks her question, but his expression softens somewhat almost immediately.
'The missing Anarrian child,' he explains, 'and hopefully nothing else, though this will be disruptive enough. I need to know the hold is safe and it's contents not tampered with. And if not, we will need to know the damage. Get to it, Officer Tenda.'

A boy who never seems to want to go home just yet is certainly something that Lan can relate to. And yet… a boy who is hungry enough to eat military rations and yet still doesn't want to go home? That raises an interesting question… "Is the boy afraid of us, or is his fear connected to something else?" Lan wonders.
Placing his hand on Bran's shoulder, he leans close and speaks softly.  **"Bran, if you'd be so kind, take your time making it to the crew lounge. News travels fast on this ship and I'd like to make sure the entire crew doesn't file in to gawk at our new guest."**
Without waiting for a reply, Lan kneels down so that he can speak to the boy at eye level. **"Well, my friend, there is another crew member who'd like to speak to you, and then I'm sure we can arrange to get you home…if that's where you wish to go."**  With that he rose and leaves for the crew lounge.
Once there he finds Pyar awaiting Bran and the child. Lan has had little opportunity to interact with the man. He respects him as he does all men who devote their lives to service, but worries that the older man may have the typical soldier's regard for the diplomat. Consequently, as always he endeavors to speak with respectful deference.
**"Begging your pardon sir, Bran is on his way with the child so that you may speak with him, but I wanted the opportunity to consult with you first. The child is afraid, and I don't think he's done anything wrong. If you think it's appropriate, perhaps you might have your discussion with him in your quarters? If the entire crew starts arriving here while you two talk, I'm afraid the child will feel like he's on trial – and he's scared enough as it is."**

'Master Kosar,' Pyar replies in his gruff voice, nodding acknowledgement to the Jedi, 'I appreciate your suggestion but I think we should be fine. Master Kalvar will be present also, and I should think our combined authority will be enough to deter the curious. You may stay if you wish to help ensure that, though ultimately as our mission leader it will be Master Kalvar's decision who should be allowed to remain present.'
'If you're concerned about my interrogating the child, you needn't worry. I have no interest in answers from the boy, save perhaps the answer to how he slipped in without any one noticing. My priority is deciding how he will be taken home. Since our passenger shuttle isn't hyperspace capable this presents an unfortunate complication to our schedule.'
*One that I really didn't need*, the old soldier thinks, *though aren't they all.*
'I'm also here,' he adds, 'to make sure no matter what sob story the child might feed us that he *is* taken home. I won't be party to any crime, and I won't suffer the addition of an unscreened stranger to our merry little band. He may only be a child, but who knows what problems this Anarrian might cause for us directly or indirectly?'

The longer Jeic stays around the mechanical soldier the less he feels inclined to agree with him. **"If I may interject, the boy comes from a very brutal society. Even though returning him might seem to be the right thing, it may not be the correct course of action. The Anarris people rewarded strength and abused the weak, that was how the society worked. If the boy was stealing food from us, it's possible he couldn't have gotten it anywhere else."** Jeic put forth his argument as best he could keeping pace with the aged soldier. **"I'm just asking that you not disregard everything the boy says before he speaks."** *How close-minded individual such as you got put on a journey such as this is beyond me.*

## Re: Chapter One

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-30 11:55:09)

Pyar sees something of the look in Jeic's eyes and sighs.
'You don't seem to understand the potential repercussions of even a seemingly small act like taking in a runaway child. I ask you to put serious thought to this, please: our mission is not a zealous crusade where we sweep in to right all the wrongs of the Galaxy, exerting our will as though it were some universal Law. It is a diplomatic one. The brief is to make contact with new civilisations and expand the interests of the Republic. If we ignore the customs and laws of the cultures we visit we will be disrespecting them and far from developing diplomatic ties we will be ensuring our failure. This may not seem important to you on a personal level, but what you, I, or anyone else feels on a personal level *doesn't matter*. We are representatives and *employees* of our government, and we must act like it.'
'And as the man employed to head up the mission's security,' the Gaffer continues, pointing at his chest for emphasis, 'it is *my* responsibility to see to the safety of each crew member and passenger who is taking part in that mission. Hate me if you want, but know that I'm only doing my duty: would it pain me to return an innocent child to a bad situation? Yes, it would, contrary to what you may think I have a heart. But whether I feel sympathy for the boy is entirely irrelevant, for I would be failing in my duty to everyone - to *you* - were I to put my personal feelings before what I know is the responsible thing to do.'

**"Aye, if you wish,"** he replies to the Jedi, still unsure about them. Bran had heard different stories about Jedi but had never spent much time around them. As the Jedi leaves he turns back to the child.
**"Here, lad *bach*, give Ferro what's left of that pack, we'll get you some real food,"** he says crouching down near the two and scratching at Ferro's ear. **"I would say you could ride Ferro's shoulders to the lounge, but he won't fit through the corridors easily. You can ride mine then if you like. Well, boy *bach*? And what's your name, hmm?"**

Lan speaks carefully, certain that the proper tone is essential. There is no value to be had in challenging Pyar or undermining his authority; he is a useful ally after all. However, it is important at this stage of the mission that he not be passive either; Pyar must understand that Lan has his own duties both as a diplomat and as a Jedi and that he stands by those.
**"You're quite correct Pyar that the diplomatic costs of improper action here may be high – even too high to bear. But I don't agree with your characterization of what are responsibilities are. This is not a question of whether we should intervene and step in to right a wrong that isn't our concern. The moment that child stowed away on our ship, he became our responsibility. If he is in any kind of danger at home, our returning him is not a matter of intervention – we become participants in that harm. All I ask is that you wait to contact Annaris with the news that we've found the boy until *after* we've heard from him and considered our best course of action. If we act carefully we may be able to avoid a diplomatic incident *and* protect the boy. If we act hastily, we may accomplish neither."**
Pyar's curt response is not unexpected, but the damage will have to be dealt with later. For now Lan senses that it is best to leave Pyar to his duties. And there are other avenues that may be pursued...
Before he turns to leave he makes eye contact with Jeic, hoping the technicians sees that he's grateful for his support in this discussion.
Now, to find Dard -- Lan thinks as he leaves the crew lounge -- if this does amount to a conflict over the boy's welfare, he may be my best ally...

Doing as he's told, the boy holds out the half eaten ration to Ferro, letting out a laugh as the lupine snatches it carefully yet quickly out of the boy's small hands. "**Dilta**," he says, reaching up again to scratch the mounts ears, all his fear now gone. "**Do you have *onlux***?" Dilta asks, enthused now that he would be getting some proper food. Eagerly he hold out his arms to be picked up, taking advantage of Bran's offer. He squeals with delight as the older human picks him up.

---

Karros gives Pyar a quick nod as she leaves, thoughtful as she goes about the task assigned to her. Arriving soon after her departure, Kalvar arrives just as Lan is leaving, giving his fellow Jedi a nod of acknowledgment as they pass. Entering the now emptied lounge, the Jedi commander glances around, his gaze landing on Jeic and then finally Pyar. "**Sitrep?**" he asks.

---

## Re: Chapter One

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-30 18:58:05)

Pyar raises an eyebrow, and looks between Lan and Jeic, apparently united against him.
'You are too hasty to vilify me,' the security chief responds. If I were going to contact anyone before hearing what he has to say I would be at the comms station right now. I am an old soldier, and got that way by not making hasty decisions. All I ever said was that the boy needs to be *returned*, and that I intend to ensure that outcome. I never said that we couldn't attempt to provide him help if it is in our means. But there is only so much that we can or indeed should do. Some of the more... empathic members of our group may not see that, which is my concern.'

---

As Kalvar enters, Pyar straightens up - not that he had been particularly slouched to start with, his head rising a mere inch at the gesture of respect. His stern eyes meet the Jedi's own.
'Sir,' he acknowledges the sitrep request, 'the boy was found in the hold by Bran and his creature. He is bringing him now, and I expect Ferro has probably sniffed out anything else untoward if it is there to be found. Nevertheless I've sent my team to perform their own sweep, and instructed them to check for damage, items that don't belong, and items that are missing.'
'I accept responsibility for this security breach, Master Kalvar, and I apologise. I was keeping an eye on the loading, but I must have missed something.
'The boy is only small and would have had a relatively easy time sneaking up to one of the crates furthest from the transport,' Pyar speculates, 'he presumably got inside one and was loaded by Sigma. We will have to confirm that so I can revise our security protocols to prevent any repeat incidents.'

**"Well then Dilta, up you get, ha!"** Bran says as he hoists the boy and places him on his shoulders, the boy's small legs hanging a few inches below Bran's collar bones. **"*Onlux*? Well boy *bach*, I have no idea. We'll find out shortly though, won't we? If we don't I'll make you something from my homeworld, hmm? Ferro, *gwirio'r dal, yn drylwyr.

**"We're going to see two men, Dilta *bach*, one a Jedi, one a old soldier. Be warned, the soldier is scary looking, but like Ferro his appearance is deceiving. He's not as cold as he looks, hmm? If you ask politely, after they finish talking to you, he may tell you tales of the wars he's seen. Doesn't that sound interesting, Dilta *bach*? We are going to see them in the crew lounge, where we prepare and eat our meals. Even better, hmm?"** Bran tells the boy as they make their way through the corridors, Dilta ducking as needed to pass through the ports.
As they draw near the lounge, Bran begins speaking again, slightly louder, to forewarn the occupants of their arrival: **"Here we are Dilta *bach*, the ship's galley. How is this *onlux* made? What are it's ingredients?"**

------------------------------
As the two bipeds leave Ferro licks his massive chops and eyes the still wrapped rations forlornly, then moves to check the hold. Unlike his brother he doesn't have to check it top to bottom with his eyes, he simply meanders the hold, sniffing here and there, looking for any scent not of the crew and not of the boy.

Lan paces up and down the corridor. He intended to seek our Dard for his assistance but thinks better of it. Something about his encounter with the child, both in meditation and in person, has him deeply unsettled. He has a bad feeling -- but in the end, he can't be sure whether the ominous sense plucking at the back of his mind is a concern for the child or for the mission. To do anything further before the facts make themselves clear…
His revery is broken by the sound of Bran approaching with the child. (Correction, apparently his name is Dilta.) Lan turns to face them. He's pleased to see that the child, high on Bran's shoulders, is more relaxed now. Even smiling. *Truly, the child could have done no better than be found by the hunter,* he muses. As soon as Lan had met the man and observed his relationship with his Varg, more that of friends than that of a man and his mount, he'd been impressed. He was certain that the pair of them, Bran and Ferro, would be a great asset on this mission.
He follows them back into the crew lounge, hoping to observe without drawing too much attention to himself -- given the note on which their last conversation ended, any further discussion with Pyar at the moment is likely to do more harm than good. Best to wait and only intervene if his fears for Dilta prove to be well-founded.

## Re: Chapter One

### **Alicia** (2010-12-07 19:22:37)

Kalvar nods as Pyar gives his report on the situation, "**Prudent, if there's anything else to be found…**" he starts his attention refocusing and his words dying off as Bran arrives, his warning echoing into the lounge as he nears. "**We will find out shortly what had transpired.**"
The Annarrian child rides high on Bran's shoulders, laughing at the game of ducking and jostling as he is transported from the cargo hold to the lounge. He grows quiet as he spots Pyar and Kalvar waiting for them in the mess, a look between one of astonishment and fright cross his features as he gazes first at Kalvar his eyes focusing on the lightsaber at the Jedi's hip and then at the cybernetics on Pyar's features. When Bran sets him down of the floor, he looks back at the scout, unsure.
Next to Pyar, Kalvar gives a calming, reassuring gesture and gives the child a small smile. "**There's no reason to be afraid.. Dilta, was it?**" When the boy nods Kalvar motions for him to step forward, which the young Annarian does reluctantly at first. Leading the child to the table, the Jedi indicates for Dilta to take a seat taking the seat opposite of the one he takes. "**We would just like for you to tell us how it was you came to be here,**" the Jedi commander says lightly.
Looking between Kalvar, the aged gaffer, Bran, the Zabrak tech and the observing Lan, Dilta's attention finally returns to Kalvar. Aware of the audience he's having to recount to he starts nervously, "**Well.. I… I was wandering around the starport, exploring see. I was getting rather hungry, but I don't have any money to buy any food. I saw the crates being loaded were marked as carrying the foodstuffs so I decided to help myself. I heard someone coming towards me, so I ducked into the crates so I could get away once they passed.**" He looks between the men, looking for any sort of reaction. With a small motion, Kalvar urges the boy to continue. Dilta continues, but seems to slide further down in his seat, as if waiting for the adults around him to don their punishment for what he had done. "**Before I could get out, I felt the box getting picked up and moved so I waited till it got quiet again. So I waited and then finally, after it had been quiet for a long time I opened the crate and tried to get out without making a sound… but I tripped and fell as the crate tipped. There was no one around so I though no one heard so began to eat some of the rations I had found inside.**"

Pyar does not miss the confused, frightened look given to his cybernetics by the alien child. He starts to smile reassuringly but thinks better of it, realising it will probably come across entirely differently to the manner he intends.
He listens to the story unfold in predictable fashion, exactly how he knew it would. There is always the small chance the Anarrian is lying or has unwittingly done something or brought something aboard, and for this reason alone he has sent his crew on what will probably seem to them a fool's errand. But even Pyar knows that in this case the truth is most likely just as the boy tells it.
'Well at least we now know how to prevent this happening again,' he comments drily, 'Jeic can install some better sensors in the loading droid.'
The Gaffer frowns suddenly, a thought occuring.
'But why did you not have food, Dilta? Or money? And why,' he continues gravely, 'were you lurking around our ship when there are people on your planet looking for you?'
In Pyar's mind he has come to expect one of two likely replies - always assuming the child owns up to the truth - and he likes neither one of them.

After Bran lets the boy down he moves off to the corner, but stays within sight thinking the child is comfortable around him and not wanting to frighten him by leaving him with complete strangers. *Complete strangers? Like me, until I carried him on my shoulders. How easily children trust. Unfortunate that it is a bad thing in this galaxy, to trust so readily or easily. Hmmm…* he muses as he listens to the story. At the bit about money and food he finds himself confused, not associating the two. He'd known many a night with an empty stomach, till he had learned to hunt, till he and Ferro had learned to work together seamlessly. While listening, he scrolls slowly through the lounge's food station's menu, looking for *onlux* in its database of foods.

"Go ahead, Dilta. I know you don't know any of us, but I assure you on my honor as a Jedi that you are in no trouble with us, and that none among us wish for anything but your well-being."
Alongside his words, he reaches out gently with the force. He does not wish to manipulate the child, but merely to relax him so that he trusts this foreign, and perhaps frightening, crew. Over the years he has seen many a victim protect those that do them harm out of misguided love or loyalty or simple fear.

Dard sighs heavily as he disconnects the myriad of devices from his computer, folding it up and shoving it disdainfully to the other side of the desk. His hands ached from the unnecessary expedience he'd put into transcribing relevant notes as they'd pertain to what he had captured so far but his restlessness had forewarned him about impending catastrophe. It could only be either that he was forgetting something so important that it would negate all the work he had managed to do so far or there was something very interesting going on and he was not there to properly capture it. Both of these thoughts dried his mouth rather unpleasantly as he wrapped his fingers against the plastex ponderously for a few moments.
Pushing his chair out, he stood and gathered a few of the recording devices scattered across his workspace and started walking towards where he remembered the Lounge to be. After all, what were the odds no one was there? He also made a mental note to make a satirical comment about the Force should anyone ask how he had any idea something was going on in the first place.
Thinking better of it, Dard Onnirr decided to run instead.

The boy looks down his eyes wide with fright as the enhanced man speaks to him. "**I left my group… I've been told not to, but none of the others want to see the things I want to.**" Dilta is calmed by the Jedi's words as the Force wraps him in its comforting embrace. Letting out a soft sigh as the tension eases out of him he continues. "**I would have gone home for my meals, but it was on the other side of town and I wasn't ready to go home. Mom and dad would know I had gone out by myself and I would be punished.**"
Looking through the system, Bran finds mention of *onlux* in the manifest of foods received in trade from the planet and it's actually a spice which reportedly the Anarrians put on everything like salt.
Standing, Kalvar holds out a calming hand to those gathered, drawing silence. "**However you came to be here Dilta, we're going to take you back now. Until then, you will remain here with Bran and Lan, who will make sure you have what you need.**" He nods to the two men acknowledging them in their own rights. His attention turns to Pyar, and asks half in comment and in question, "**I trust you'll inform me if the search reveals anything out of the ordinary?**" Not waiting for much of a response he makes to leave, giving Dard a nod in passing as he leaves the lounge for the bridge.

The slightly red-faced Journalist enters the lounge considerably slower than he had originally intended, and is very pleased to discover a thick atmosphere of interest centered around a stranger who also happened to be a small child.

The ship shudders slightly as it drops out of lightspeed, the unexpected stop causing some turbulence, but it doesn't take long for the engines to work back up to full speed as the ship turns around and then re-enters hyperspace.
The boy looks confused as he looks at the new comer, the appearance of the reporter startling him. His attention is diverted when Bran moves beside him and proffers the datapad. He curiously looks at the screen, but obviously nothing is appealing to the young boy. Finally almost at random he points to the nerf nuggets, and he smiles at Bran pleased with his selection.
Pyar makes it to the bay to find his three security personnel discussing over a small crate which had apparently been mis-marked. Instead of containing the indicated energy cells, instead has food rations. Jarros and Krieger go off to busy themselves further in the bay as Karros looks over the datapad with a frown.

The trip back to Anarris lasts almost an hour and soon enough the Errant Voyager once again drops out of lightspeed in the system. Dilta, the Anarrian child spends his time eating the meal provided by Bran and then proceeds in a game of 20 questions with him and the Jedi, Elan. The two learn that the child is very inquisitive and once the line of questioning comes up that he is very adventurous as well, this not being the first time he has gone off on his own and finding himself in more trouble than he should probably handle alone. He seems to always manage to find a way out of his difficulties with his skill of sneaking about.

Bran reads the communique from his comlink asking him to accompany the security chief down with the boy while Dilta crawls across Ferro's furry belly. The boy is supposedly learning the proper way to groom a Varg, but instead is mostly having fun scratching and tickling the monstrous beast. He stands and moves over the large saddle against the wall of the hold-turned-kennel and draws out his belt with holster and sheath. He straps the heavy belt round his waste and settles the weight of the weapons while checking that all is in order. He then turns to the boy and the grown Varg-turned-pup.
**"Alright Dilta *bach*, it's time to go. Say *hwyl fawr* to Ferro,"** he tells the boy as he lifts him from the Varg's belly and places him on his own shoulders for the walk to the hanger.
**"Ferro, *meddwl y llong tra fy mod yn mynd yn,*"** he tells the Varg as he and the boy leave.

The exasperation on Dard Onnirr's face isn't exactly hidden as he shuffles into the Hanger at the request of their Security Chief. Having expedited his awareness about what had transpired with the boy, and refreshing himself on any source material pertaining to culture and etiquette, he had apparently been a little too thorough and was now completely out of time to make use of the preparation debriefing the boy.
His position of disappointment unique amongst his colleagues, the now slightly-pouting Journalist slumps himself into his seat and straps in without so much as a snarky utterance. Though, turning briefly to Mr. Indesqu, he does say **"Just a forewarning, I'm going to have some liberties when writing about this whole ordeal with the wayward youth."**

The Duros pilot has already made her way to the shuttle and is in the process of running the preflight checks as the landing party begins to arrive. "**Hey Chief?! There's something you should see,**" she calls back. Her hands pause in their work as she looks over a display, distracted by what she sees there. Her expression is perturbed as she looks back at Pyar. The display rotates through a series of images, the familiar faces of Bran, Burr and himself with the other members of that party listed as accomplices. The crime: the suspected abduction of the missing child, Dilta.

Pyar makes his way over to Burr and peers at the displays over her shoulder. As they unveil their nasty surprise he reddens noticeably.
'Oh for...' he snaps, 'I just *knew* this child would be trouble. '
He gestures at the monitors as the rest of the party come forward, inviting them to look.
Lan, I'll rely on your diplomatic skills to spin this, that is unless Kalvar decides to come after all. You too Dard, see if you can use your journalist's wits productively for once. Remember it's not just our collective ass on the line here, but our government's reputation with the Anarrians.'
Striding back to the transport's ramp, the CSO hails Jedi Kalvar over comms.
'Sir, something's come up,' he tells the Knight heavily,'we've been accused of kidnapping Dilta. If we were just returning a runaway it would be one thing, but now we have to persuade them we're innocent of a crime. I wondered if you would like to lead the team yourself, given the diplomatic damage being done here?'

Pyar was right of course. Their involvement was perfectly innocent, a fact that the boy would surely attest to if asked. But, the specter of child abduction raised the most intense of emotions -- the likelihood that they would encounter calm and level-headed individuals to whom they could make their case was slim indeed. And wars had been started over far less. Yes, careful diplomacy was certainly to be the order of the day.
**"Pyar – I'd like to make a suggestion for the entire landing party. It's imperative that we be armed in case we must defend ourselves. But we make our position more difficult if it appears that a gang of armed men are returning the missing boy – perhaps if the landing party only carries small arms that they can conceal on their person. In diplomacy, I'm afraid, the image of threat can be more important than the actuality of threats."**

Falling pray to a burst of laughter, Dard Onnirr shakes his head into his palm while struggling to contain a somewhat goofy grin. **'You know what, forget what I said, this'll be fine.'** Turning to Jedi Kosar and making a theatrical show of revealing the Hold-out Blaster under his vest, the Contact Stunner under some mesh on his right glove, and the Wrist Blaster under his opposing sleeve, he takes the opportunity to muse upon a hypothetical scenario before presenting it with an apprehensive smirk.
**'If I might suggest a more unconventional approach, what if we convince them that the boy was coerced to sneak on to our ship after having a bomb planted on him without his knowledge as an act of terrorism against the Republic?'** Dard begins, holding his arms up as if to deflect the incredulous looks he has seen pasted on many faces before. **'Just hear me out. Their perception holds us in only a slightly worse light than the incompetence that will be assumed if word gets out that a child snuck on board and caused this debacle and a delay in our journey. Now simply plopping him down on the planet and beating a hasty retreat without being noticed is, I assume, not possible at this point, so perhaps our Jedi friend here is on to something with his show of force, but on a more broad and *implied* scale. We show up all fire and vengeance and maybe we can spin it so it'll be in everyone's self-interest to forget this ever happened. The Boy gets home, we get to go, and the next diplomats to come through here have a slightly more difficult day than they have anticipated.'** 
Laughingly nervously after a moment or two, he awkwardly scratches the back of his head. **'Just get me something that's convincingly small with quite a punch for some wings and I can make this tale fly to whatever Planetary Sovereign has to hear it.'**

**"Well, Dard, that is an interesting suggestion to say the least. But even if your…shall we say, *unconventional* approach succeeds what do we leave behind us? The search for the "terrorists" could become a witch-hunt that threatens many innocent people in our absence.
"Moreover, when our deception is inevitably discovered that would be the end of diplomatic relations between the Republic and the Annarians. No, I must strongly urge that we be open about the innocent nature of the incident and present no show of force."**

**"Hmm good point,"** the Journalist admits, obviously finding this entire thing much more to his interest than anything anyone has observed previously as he thumbs his chin with a great deal of concentration. **"Pity there wasn't a particularly squirrelly looking individual with an unintelligible protest sign shouting at us until we left because they'd probably be better off without Fictitious McAngrypants,"** he muses, jerking his head towards Pyar. **"After all, it's not going to be me who gets chewed out for this so by all means, Truthward Ho!"**

Bran comes forward with the child on the last leg of the conversation, and chooses to ignore most of it, the subject not being one he is awfully concerned with. **"Go on, Dilta *bach*, strap in,"** he says as he sighs and removes his belt, never enjoying being disarmed. **"I have no small concealable weapons, I will simply go unarmed I guess,"** he says as he stows his blaster and blade in the baggage area above his seat.

Kalvar's voice comes over the ship's comm, having been listening to the conversation via Pya'r's commlink he takes a moment to route the channel into the shuttle. "**It would be unwise to deceive the Anarrians and would only cause more problems for others to have to deal with. The circumstances are already strenuous and we must tread carefully.
"I will remain here and attempt to quell things with the government. From my dealings with their officials I recommend you avoid being taken into custody. Their laws are different and they won't be as fair in their due process as you might expect. They will be more likely to believe you guilty of kidnapping the boy, than of bringing him back. Our best chance of getting this resolved is to return Dilta to his family and have him explain what has transpired.
It would be unwise to proceed to the planet completely unarmed, while confrontation is not in our best interest, being taken into custody would not be to yours.**"

Bran easily slides his belt back on as if removing it for two seconds is part of his daily routine before asking Pyar, **"Should I whistle up Ferro? He has a way of *darbwyllo*, what is the Basic word… dissuading trouble."** While he waits for an answer he checks Dilta's crash webbing to make sure the boy has it properly done.

Dard Onnirr visibly winces as he hears the Commander's voice over the comm and looking upward only slightly guilty. **'Ah right, of course. Merely a habit,'** he states before looking around to his compatriots and assuring them, **'The problematic patch jobs, not the deceit, that is… Seriously.'**
The Journalist is acutely aware that they have just been given permission to *defend* themselves the way so many have claimed to, and is reluctant to show his apprehension going down to a planet to face a volatile situation with a plan of "Shoot them when they inevitably try to arrest you". On the other hand, most sentient species are capable of logic and it hardly makes sense for a group of intergalactic child abductors to go back to face the pitchforks after they've been made.
Raising his hand, and then immediately dropping it when realizing how silly it looks, he asks, **'We're not landing in the open are we? Because people suspected of a crime aren't exactly low on my list of "People I'd Landlock" if I ran a Starport.'**

'Bran, you and I will go visibly armed,' Pyar tells the team's scout, 'while Lan's suggestion is a good one I don't think it will hurt us to appear with an obvious security detail provided we don't look like a war party. It might make any would-be aggressors slightly more cautious.'
'We'll leave Ferro though,' he adds after a moment's thought, 'he may end up more a hindrance than a help if worst comes to worst.'
The CSO scratches his chin as he considers his options, nails raking gently against the rough silver and black bristles at his jawline. He wonders when he'll next have an opportunity to shave.
'If you lot were a trained team of commandos and if we had the resources to cloak our approach I might consider an unannounced insertion to quietly return the boy home,' the soldier tells Dard, 'but neither is the case. In the circumstances we have no chance of success. We'll have to land openly. Bran, I'll want you to explain to Dilta the problem he's caused for us on the journey. It may be that his voice will be the one that counts in proving our innocence.'
'Right,' he somberly concludes, 'we're not going to get any more prepared than we already are. Time to go.'
Moving from the ramp, the Gaffer finds himself a seat and straps himself into his crash webbing.

Burr looks back at Pyar with an annoyed look, stopping mid motion in her preflight checks. "**I would be insulted if it wasn't for the fact we just met, Chief,**" she says before turning back to her controls. "**I can land outside the city at least long enough to drop you off without them realizing we're there.**"

**"While he is a beautiful beast, Varg don't hunt by being easily seen. I tend to make myself hard to find easily too. I also have camouflage for Ferro and I. If that's the approach you wish to take, you can drop Dilta, Ferro and I outside the city. I'll be in and out with no one knowing, especially if we wait for nightfall. We will be like the *Anadl y Brenin Llwyd*, our actions felt but unseen,"** he tells the Chief, knowing the man had yet to see him and Ferro in action.
