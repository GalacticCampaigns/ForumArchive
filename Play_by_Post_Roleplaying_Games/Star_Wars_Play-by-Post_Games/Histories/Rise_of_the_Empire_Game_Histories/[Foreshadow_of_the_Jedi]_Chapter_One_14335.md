As the lights of Corosaunt never seem to fade due to the sun and then the many lights that cover the planet we see the Jedi Temple towering out above the many buildings. Many masters and padawans are coming and going doing various missions for the Senate and the Jedi council. As the jedi seem to be going on missions at the will of the force they must be ready for any course of action that is needed of them, from used of the force to weilding a lightsaber in hostile negotiations. The halls of the temple seem to be busy as ever with padawans following on the coat tails of their masters and jedi knights eager to get their next mission.
Our jedi heros find themselves at various places in the temple.
(For the jedi in the party start off with any location you wish in the temple other then the High Council room.)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Life has been an interesting turn of events for our young mandalorian clone. Only being alive for almost nine years you have the boby of a full grown man. With the never ending training by the mandalorian warrior Jango Fett finally at its end you are now donned with the armor of the ever elite ARC trooper. Although the rest of the ARC units were put into statis you were brought out by the Nulls and reconditioned by their adopted fatehr Kal Skirata. As days pass by you and the nulls are getting stronger in the simulations of battle and the expertise of the many different weapons that are provided. You have noticied that the NUlls each have a distinct personality about them, while you yourself have started to finally develope your own. As you are cleaning your weapons for the fifth time you comlink bleeps and you ordered to meet in the training simulator to be debriefed by your commanding officer fellow Null Trooper, Captain Jaden.
(Please only post if your characters have been approved to move on and your backstories are submitted with your sheets.)
May the force be with you.

Nevlik is out in the hangar, looking over the aethersprite interceptors the jedi maitain for use. He finds much peace here, more so than other places of the temple.
**DarthAnthrax**
Peace
That single word perfectly described TormÂ´s feelings at the moment. And any moment he spent in meditation here in his own quiet corner of the room of a thousand fountains. He would come here to meditate ever so often after he and master Haart returned from a mission. Especially if their mission had involved an especially gruesome crime. He loved this room because of the quiet and serenity he felt here, and here he could fully relax, and allow himself to become one with the Force.
**master_Tru**
Just outside the temple of the jedi sit two individuals surrounded by the citizens of Corosaunt as they pass by on their various daily routines. These two individuals surrounded by billions but completely alone. Sitting cross legged the two are speechless but converse continuously. One a middle aged human male most likely from one of the core words from the look of his facial features and garb, the other a short tan furred humanoid of an unknown race.
"The force flows through you through the trees through the very air you breath. Give you focus it will young padawon." Still the two exchange no words yet are in deep lesson. "Reach out with your feelings Roki ...... you must focus Roki your curiosity must be giving to control. Remember your mistake on Rodia, learn from it you must."
"Yes master Sol I try."
"I do not want you to try." As the lesson continues peoples of all races go about their day. "Thats what I am talking about Roki you let your curiosity control your emotions."
"But sir that woman she is about to be robbed."
"The authorities are already handling it, as jedi we can not fight every battle. People must be able to fend for themselves without the constant interferance of the jedi."
Confused Roki gives a slight nod of acknowledgment and with thought of protest Roki pushes that aside. "You are wise master Sol."
For a short time longer the two continue before master Sol breaks the silence. "We will be called soon to the temple let us make our way through the garden before we are summoned." With a metallic protest from his left leg master Sol stands. The small Bimm gracefully gets to his feet a look of amazement on his face as he looks up to his master. The two slowly take the scenic route to the jedi temple.
**Green Dice** 
Deuce cursed at himself. He knew better than to order his squad to go down a narrow passage way. That route was the most direct one to his objective. He should have known that, in war, if something looks too good to be true, itâ€™s probably an ambush or its booby trapped. In this case, it was an ambush. With no cover around, two Nulls in concealed firing positions cut down Deucesâ€™ team of five troops while they were bottlenecked in the passageway. If this wasnâ€™t a training simulation, they would all be dead and it was Deuces fault. Was this the kind of leadership an ARC should possess? Deuce felt as if Kel himself was going to strip him of his ARC status right then and there and send him back into stasis. Maybe Deuce deserved it?
Training with the Nulls was difficult to say the least. This wasnâ€™t the first time he had played war games with them, but it was his first time leading a squad as an ARC. If the Nulls were pulling their punches before, they certainly werenâ€™t going to give him any quarter now. Deuce didnâ€™t mind though. He would rather die a million simulated deaths so that he wouldnâ€™t actually die in the trenches; and the Nulls were happy to oblige. Deucesâ€™ pride was more bruised than anything else.
Back at the dorms, Deuce wasnâ€™t sure if ARCs got their own private rooms in the dormitory but if they did, he hasnâ€™t gotten his yet. It was all the same to Deuce. He enjoyed spending time with his fellow clones. Recently getting out of the shower, Deuce now sat on his bunk in his grey off-duty jumpsuit. Pieces of his DC-17 were strewn across his bed as he cleaned one of the smaller moving parts of the weapon. He was so focused that he almost didnâ€™t hear his comlink beeping.
Reaching over, Deuce scooped up the device and activated it.
â€œDeuce hereâ€ he spoke
It was Captain Jaden. Deuce was needed for a debriefing.
â€œYes sirâ€ Deuce replied as he turned the comlink off.
Almost without thinking, Deuce reassembled his weapon with such precision that only comes from incessant practice. He returned the weapon next to the identical one in his wall locker. Deuce headed off to his meeting wondering about the chewing out he was about to receive for getting his squad killed.
Today was not a good day.
**GM Visto** 
As the engine exhaust and the smell of oil fills the air from within the hanger we find Nevlik at peace with himself and tuned in with the force as he goes over various starships giving them his personsal look overs. As he is working a female Iktotchi stands at the doorway to the hanger bay just observing her padawan. Feeling his connection to the force flow over her...for she finds comfort in while behind the pilot seat as well. Not wanting to keep the others waiting she calls out for her padawan.
"Nevlik come we must be going now, We must not keep the others waiting."
_______________________________________________________________________________
Within the room of a thousand fountains peace washes over Torm as he is attempting to be one with the force. As he almost finds that peace his comlink bleeps loudly. Master Haarts voices comes over the comlink, "Padawan meet with me at within the training center." after that the comlink goes silent.
_______________________________________________________________________________
As Roki beems with pride upon his master he has a feeling that they will not always be together. He doesn't know why this feeling has suddenly washed over him but it is now there. As Roki is about to talk to his master on their walk about this feeling Sol's comlink bleeps on the other end of the comlink is a voice that Roki has rarely heard. Master Sol steps away to talk within the comlink away from the crowd of the street. When he turns back around he smiles down at his padawan and says, "We are requested at the temple training center." He turns and starts to continue his path back to the temple...pausing he turns around to look at Roki. "Padawan, when I said we were requested it meant you as well." A smile peels across his face as you fall in step with him.
_______________________________________________________________________________
The sounds of Deuces footsteps echo throughout the hallway. They echo so loudly for he is the only clone headed down the hall and he has a lot on his mind...espically about todays events. As Deuce looks down the hallway he can see to clone troopers standing guard at the doorway where he was instructed to go. As you approach the two gurads snap crisply to attention offering you a salute by extending the guns they hold in front of them vertically. The guard on the left says, "The Captain will be here to debrief you, within a minute sir!" with that the door slides open and you can see a dimly lit table with a chair next to it.

**SacredPhoenix**
Nevlik springs out of the seat and calmly walks with his master to the Training Center
"master, can you tell me why we are going to the Training Center?"
**Green Dice**
Deuce felt so small while he walked down the corridor. The echoes of his footsteps were hammering in his head. Turning the corner, Deuce saw the entrance to the simulation room and the troops who were guarding it. The troops saluted him and Deuce returned a sharp salute back before he was let into the room.
Deuce walked into the mostly empty room slowly. He usually saw this room when it was full of armored clone troops discussing tactics and strategy as well as being briefed for up coming war simulations. But now he was the only living thing in here. He walked around to the back of the table and faced the door. With arms crossed behind his back and feet separated shoulder length apart, Deuce assumed an â€œat restâ€ stance while he readied himself to be berated.
He kept an eye on the door so that he could snap to attention when the Captain walked in.
**GM Visto**
Nevlik~
With a stern look upon her face she looks upon you saying, "Padawan if you have to ask why we are going to the training center then you havn't been there enough." As she finishes addressing you her comlink bleeps and she answers it with haste. You hear a famliar voice coming from the other side of the comlink. Shuddering you fall in step behind your master headed to the training center to pratice lightsaber combat. "Although you skill as a pilot is well honed your skill with the lightsaber is that of a rusty spoon. We must sharpen it to that of a knife so that when the time comes you will be able to wield it properly...although I pray that you never have to resort to bring out your lightsaber other then to practice."
_______________________________________________________________________________
Lt. Deuce
At exactly one minute after you have entered the room the door slides opens. In walks in a rugged looking man with a crew cut and a long brown coat, he is flanked by three clone troopers both you can see are ARC captains. You notice that one of the captains isnt dressed in the same way as the as rest he is in clone armor but its markings are of a pilot captain. Kal Skirata walks over to the table trying to hide his limp but for someone as perceptive as you it is very noticable. He nods at you saying, "I hope you don't mind son but I am going to take this chair and park my carcess in it." As he says that he slowly pulls the chair out and rest upon it. He pulls out what appears to be a holo disc in his hand and starts to twirl it in his fingers. He leans over his shoulder and tells the ARCs rest. As soon as the words leave his mouth one of the ARC's dons his helmet and leans on the wall with a grim expression on his face. The pilot dons his helmet and simply stands there as if waiting for something. The final ARC doesn't so much as flinch standing at ease with his hands on both his blasters as if he is itching to get back into the simulators. A few moments later a droid rolls into the silent room and Kal becons it over and inserts the holo recording. The recording shows the combat simulator in which a group of clones are are sneaking around attempting to get to the objective. They enter a hallway and an ambush beats them back to halt. Within the recording you also see a lieutenant holding his ground pulling back a fallen trooper and then going back in for two more. Kal Skirata pauses the recording there and then ask the droid to play the other recording. You see a the same hallway and an identical set of clones walking down it. You see a captain leading the group and the ambush strikes. The captain fires off a few shots before falling to the ground leaving his troops open to attack and without a leader. Kal pauses the recording and looks up at you.
**master_Tru**
Quietly Master and padawan continue through the gardens towards the jedi temple. Shaking his head Roki pushes thoughts of separation aside, this is what master Sol has been lecturing me on my curiosity clouds my focus. "Master Sol why would we be called again to the temple so soon after a mission?"
Master Sol smiles as he continues his pace "Oh I am sure there is some dire need of something somewhere. The eminent end of something or other, its always something." Master Sol stops to smell a flower. "See this Roki a brentlen lupine very rare, its a tribute to Master Moross`s skill in the garden." The master continues his pace again padawan in tow behind.
As Roki continues to try his focusing techniques he fails to shake the feels of inevitable separation from his master.
**DarthAnthrax**
Drifting out of his trance, Torm speaks into the comlink.
"Yes master, I will be there shortly"
Rising from his meditative stance, he starts to make his way towards the training center.
**Green Dice**
The door opened and Deuce snapped to the position of attention. He gasped as Kal Skirata entered with three clones. Not many things scared Deuce, or even rattled him, but Kal Skirata absolutely terrified him. Had Deuceâ€™s prediction of Kal coming to strip him of his ARC status come true? Deuce couldnâ€™t help but audibly gulp.
When Kal gave the order to rest to his Clone Trooper entourage, Deuce also fell back into his â€œat restâ€ position. For someone who was about to unleash an assault on an officer who couldnâ€™t keep his squad alive, Kal didnâ€™t seem angry at all. Good thing too, since Deuce was fearful of ever seeing the man angry.
As Kal inserted a holo disc into a droid, Deuce was a little concerned. Sweat started to bead a little on his brow as a holo-image appeared. He watched the two scenes, both of which seemed rather similar to his own simulation earlier that day. This was all a bit confusing.
â€œSir?â€ Deuce said as he met the gaze of his mentor.
**SacredPhoenix**
Nevlik arrives first into the training center, comtemplating what it is he has to do
**GM Visto**
Jedi -
As the doors seperate leading into the training center you see a few others have already arrivied and are patiently awaiting further instructions. There is a low whisper aroudn the room as padawans say hello to friends and alike masters greet each warmly talking about their many missions and lesson they have taught their padawans. The area starts to fill as many more masters and padawans are entering and taking seats. Master Drallig was directing people making sure that everyone was able to see the center mat and have good hearing and visibility for what was about to come.
A hush falls over the crowd as Mace Windu and fellow members of the jedi council enter the training center. They make their way to the center of the room and look upon the crowd before speaking.
(I'll wait here for the jedi in our party to respond to their arrival of the jedi training center)
_______________________________________________________________________________
LT. Deuce~
Kal Skirata looks upon you with heavy eyes. He hasn't been sleeping well the past few months with the use of live fire in the exercises many clone have loost their lives. "Son many clones have been killed during training, as the Kaminos calls it they are weeding out the inferior genes of Jango. I see it as good lads dying at the hands of the plae skinned freaks. What you just say was a captain being killed off the bat, a captain who has been training the day he born. The second recording you see it what you did in the combat zone. You saved the lives of your men at the risk of your own. Althou a few men where injured during the exercise none of them had lost their lives like the other squad who now doesn't exisit. It wasn't that the squad was inferior in any way son it just the luck of the draw. Srg. Skirata shuts down the recordings and leans on the table rubbing his brow. You can see the loss of even one clone under his command affects him yet alone a whole squad during a training exercise. He looks up at you and smiles saying, "Son what you did in that training exercise can't be taught from one man to another. You can't train a man to risk his own life to save another its something in that man that drives him to want to protect the ones he loves. Your squad is very lucky to have you have their commanding officer. Extending his hand he poionts at the captain in the pilots markings this is ARC-56 although you havn't formally met he is going to be your sqauds pilot.
The ARC walks over extending his hand grinning, "Names AP nice to meet the officer who I have the privlage of dropping behind enemy lines. And here I was wondering if they were going to give me a challange."
A rapping comes across the door and you can hear some camotion coming from other side. Before anyone can reach the door two clone sergants enter room followed by a few others. You recoginze them as your squad. They snap a salute to everyone and hastly walk up to Kal. "Sir, if you are going to strip his rank you can strip ares as well for we will not follow any other man into battle!" Grinning Kal rises and puts a hand on your shoulder, "See son somethings you can't train."
**master_Tru**
As master Sol greets many of his fellow masters so to does padawan Roki. Standing in a semi circle of other padawans Roki nods to padawan Jace Starz a fortunate student with the rare privilege of learning under master Yu the very master who had discovered Roki. Much of the conversation leans heavily on what force lesions have been learned, any actual combat one may have witnessed or even participated in, and of course the conversation goes to why they might have been summoned.
"I have learned to move small vehicles and my master says with practice there is no limit." Boasts a thin Khil his voice a melody as he speaks.
One raven haired human girl manages to stutter out "I aided my master with fending off raiders in the Prosanious system." Which is followed by an assortment of questioning on numbers and such.
Jace waves his hands motioning for quite "Shhhh! Its master Windu, I think he is about to speck." Which abruptly ends the scattered conversation. In trained discipline the padawans within Roki`s group all stand focused towards Master Windu.
**DarthAnthrax**
Torm arrives at the training center in a short while. He greets some if his fellow padawans, as well as some of the masters, before joining master Haart at his side.
"Do you know what this is about master?"
**GM Visto**
The members of the high council talk to a few of the masters before calling the whole room to silence. Mace Windu steps forward to speak as he is the ranking senior council member present. "Friends, fellow jedi we have called you here due to an emergancy that must be dealt with without a moment to waste. Master Obi-wan Kenobi and his padawan have been captured while on their mission to protect Senator Padme Amidala. The last transmission we have from Obi-wan was him confirming a creation of a clone army with the order to build such an army requested by the jedi council...which I will tell you now the jedi council did not issue such an order. Master Yoda as left to see to this clone army and judge wheater or not they will be of help to us. Obi-wan was then seen being taken alive by battle droids, Obi-wans transmission was sent via Senator Amidala and although we ordered Anakin to stay where he was safly away with the Senator she ordered him to fly to Obi-wans aid against our wishes so we must now go with all haste and all precaution to save them." Mace stares out into the room listening to the murmer of the crowd as the news settles upon them. Not wasting anytime the high council starts to issue orders about where to go and how soon they must be there. Jedi Master Plo koon speaks for a moment saying, "For those of you who I contacted via comlink if you would please stay behind for a moment so that I may confer with you on the matter at hand." As the mass of jedi masters and padawans makes way to their ships and transports, Masters Haart, Sol, and the female Itktotchi gather towards Master Koon as to see what it is they were needed for. Master Koon is to lead a team of jedi to flank potenital threats as Master Windu is to lead the frontal assulat on what ever might be present. I need you and your padawans to follow in my wake making sure that I am in a sense not flanked and we ill converge in the middle with Master Windu. If all is understood head to this transport within an half hour with what ever gear you will need.

**DarthAnthrax**
Torm listened carefully to what master Windu had to say, and he could not say he liked what he heard. Jedi captive? Clone army? And the fact that jedi would form a strike team to go into combat weighed heaviest on him. Jedi were guardians of peace and justice, not soldiers. No matter how uncomfortable he was with the current events though, he would follow at his masters side. As master Haart, together with a few other masters were summoned up front, Torm saw a familiar face in the shape of master Koon. He had a great respect for the Kel Dor jedi master, whom in fact had been responsible for bringing him here from Dorin in the first place. Patiently, he waited at a distance for his master to return, and reached out into the Force, trying to touch the future as he had learned from Volk. He could not help but feel that something was amiss, and he did not like it. He did not like it at all.
((Search your feelings +8, regarding the nature of this whole mission))
**Green Dice**
Deuce was shocked to hear that Kal wasnâ€™t here to strip his rank but to give him a command.
â€œSir, I was just doing my job. Any good soldier would have done the sameâ€ Deuce replied humbly.
â€œBut thank you, sir. Coming from you, this praise means a lot to me.â€
Kal then introduced Deuce to the newest member of his squad: a pilot.
Deuce shook the pilotâ€™s hand.
â€œNice to meet you, AP. My name is Deuce. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll get along with my boys just fine.
â€œAnd what does â€˜APâ€™ stand for, anyway?â€
Turning back to Kal,
â€œSir, are we to alter our training regiment to account for the addition of AP to the squad?â€
It was about then when Deuceâ€™s squad barged into the room demanding the same punishment as their leader. Deuce put up his hands to stop the clones.
â€œEasy there, boys. No one is getting demoted today. In fact, we have a new addition to our ranks. Sqaud, this is our pilot, AP.â€
Turning to AP
â€œAP, this is your new family.â€
**SacredPhoenix**
Nevlik rises quickly follows his master to the transport. "battle droids, it can only be the separatists, the techno union and trade federation are known members" he says to himself quietly
**master_Tru**
A hush hits the group of padawans Roki is standing with. Roki watches his master join the others, he sees Jace nod to him then join his own master. Roki stands there for a moment not sure of what to do next. Then looking around to the other padawans bows and says "May the force be with you all."
Roki makes a quick scan of the area looking for the padawans who came in with the other masters in Master Koon`s group. Not entirely sure of which padawans are who`s Roki walks towards the masters standing just behind Master Sol. Hoping the other padawans would do the same, it will give Roki a chance to meet new peoples and learn of this mission.
Noticing the Duro`s padawan Roki nods to .... him not sure of his name yet. Smiling at the Duro`s eagerness Roki takes comfort that he is not the only one eager to begin a mission.
**GM Visto**
Jedi
The masters take a few minute to converse with Master Koon and then they split from the group at the same time all with determination on their faces. Each one of them turns to their padawans and in their own ways tells each of you to gather what you will need for the journey and to meet with them in the shuttle bay with most alacrity. After they have told you that they make their ways to various locations making sure everything is ready for their mission.
As Torm uses the force to seek answers all that can be for certain is that the mission will bring mourning to many and achievement to a few.
(We will assume play of the jedi as they arrive to the shuttle bay, of course if you have items you wish to requisition you may ask for doesnâ€™t mean you will have them.)
Lt. Deuce
â€œAP means anti personnel, lieutenant.â€ says AP, â€œand to correct the lieutenant I have always been one of your squad you just never knew it.â€ He says grinning. â€œMy training dealt with extracting soldiers from battle and also dropping them off in the heat of battle. While you trained the squad I was trained on to fly low and fast. My personal modifications of the LAAT/i gave me command to the Anti-personnel laser cannons as well as the missile launchers on the craft. The composite-beam lasers on the wings have been stripped from the use of extra men. I feel that extra damage is not worth risking their lives on my wings, those have been modified as well to be controlled by either my co/pilot or myself if he is unable. Any way you look at it those weapons will and have destroyed more than any other droids in the simulations and in live fire. In the heat of battle on ground I am yours to command as per regulations but up in the air I will use any means necessary to ensure the survival of the squad.â€
Skirata walks over to the squad and shakes his head at them poking and prodding them as a father would to his young boys he hasnâ€™t seen all day. After a few moments of banter he turns to Deuce, â€œYou might as well get into training now son you never know when you all will be called. Now I must see to the rest of my boys.â€ He turns and leaves the room the two ARCâ€™s flank him as he starts to leave. After a few steps he turns back and tosses you a cylinder to Deuce. â€œAlmost forgot this is a special code that will allow you access to anyplace you need to go. AP already has one so no worry. Jaden will meet with you in the training room in exactly two minutes.â€ As he walks down the hall you feel a weight lift off your shoulders.
(We will assume play as Lt. Deuce and his squad arrive at the training center where a clone in ARC armor with red markings stands with his hands behind his back as he is off in his own little world)
**SacredPhoenix** 
Nevlik leans against the shuttle, eyes closed, waiting for the others to arrive. "I wonder if Master Koon is piloting, that would be interesting to watch."
**DarthAnthrax** 
As he reaches out through the Force, Torm is met with diffusion and uncertanity. It is like a veil has been put over his eyes, and the only things he can feel is that the future holds a lot of grief in store, perhaps for him, perhaps for someone else. He is put out of his trance by master Haart, who geives him a quick breif of their mission, and then tells him to go and get ready. Torm nods and turns to the remaining padawans and their masters, and offers them a small bow. Then he heads back to his quarters to pick up a few things that he needs.
In a while, he arrives at the shuttle bay, ready to go.
**master_Tru** 
As Master Sol asks "Gather what you need we will converge in the shuttle bay." Roki smiles and bows at his master.
"You have trained me well master Sol. I am always ready as you have prepared me so well. I need only meditation time which I am sure we will all get on route." Roki falls in behind Master Sol as they continue towards the shuttle bay. Hearing his master state under his breath "May the force be with us all." Quietly the pair meet up with the other in the shuttle bay, again Roki can not shake that feeling of separation.
Entering the Shuttle bay Master Sol bows to his fellow masters "I am Master Sol, it is good to have meet you all." Smiling as he looks down "And this is Roki Majin my padawan." Roki only manages a half wave and a smile at the group still not sure of what to think of such a mission and unable to shake off that feeling.
**GM Visto** 
Jedi
Soon after everyone arrives Master Koon emerges from the transport. â€œWe are all here? He says looking around. Good then let us be on our way.â€ As you enter the spaceship you notice nothing out of place or unusual about itâ€¦except for a few things. The quarters are limited to a few rooms and the cockpit. Master Koon explains as he walks through the ship. â€œPadawans you will be in here.â€ He motions to a small room with three sleeping mats on the floor. â€œI must apologize for the cramped quarters and not the best of accommodations but it was the best I could do with sort notice. You will notice how ever that since everything is so cramped as to say we have the fastest starship in the Temple and we will be the first to land on Geonosis and prepare for the others. If all goes well we should rendezvous with Master Yoda and find out what it is he has found or not found on his trip.â€ Master Koon waves the padawans into the room. As you each enter Master Koon seems to looking upon you and for some unknown reason Torm you feel as thou Master Koon is smiling under his mask at you, Roki you feel as thou Master Koon is trying to recall your race, and Devlik is to bewildered by the ship to notice Master Koons gestures. Before the door slides shut you can hear him say, â€œYou all have brave padawans who are strong in the force, all masters should be so lucky to have padawans such as these. With me to the cockpit if you please Masters we will go into further details of our mission while your padawans rest.â€
Soon after you feel the spaceship lifting off and within minutes feel the jump to hyperspace. Master Koon wasnâ€™t jesting when he said this ship was quick.
**master_Tru** 
Under Master Koon`s observant Roki blushes not sure what to think of the attention from such a high ranking jedi master. Master Koon`s encouraging words Roki only bushes further, its a good thing Bimm`s are covered in fur. Only Master Sol notices Roki`s little show and gives him a stern look as if to say more lecturing will follow.
Roki bows to Master Koon then to Master Sol as well. Nodding to the other padawans Roki explores the small quarters, finding himself a spot on the floor. Roki settles in for the flight in quiet meditation. With the speed of the ship Roki trys to get in what time he can practicing focus techniques.
**SacredPhoenix** 
Nevlik takes out his weapons and starts checking them to make sure they don't malfunction
**DarthAnthrax** 
As they were dismissed to their quarters, Master Koon looked at Torm, and memories of they day he was taken of Dorin flooded back to Torm. How uncertain he had been to come with the elder Kel Dor into the Jedi ranks. Master Koon had given him the same look back then, a look full of confidence, and told him the he saw the makings of a great jedi in him. An opinion that he had stood up for as he convinced those on the council that was sceptical to TormÂ´s age and to letting him join the ranks of the Jedi. Now he felt it again, and he assured himself he would not let master Koon down. He offers a bow to master Koon and the other masters, before returning to their quarters. Well there, he finds one of the others already deep in meditation, and not wishing to disturb that, Torm assumes his own meditative stance and starts to levitate a short bit over the ground. As the ship departs, Torm divides his time between trying to reach into the future, for hints and clues to the great peril he sensed before, as well as trying to get to know the other padawans a little bit.
**GM Visto** 
Jedi
After what feels like hours the doors slides open and Jedi Master Koon enters the room bearing a few trays of food. Not wanting to disturb everyone he simply reaches out and glides the trays to the side of the room and starts to withdraw from the quarters.

**Green Dice** 
The heavy door slid open revealing Lieutenant Deuce and his squad (including AP) standing in formation. Deuce was now dressed in his gleaming white armor. Blue markings streaked down his arms, were splashed across his shoulder pads, lined his kama and were displayed on his helmet. Dual blaster pistols hung at his hips and a heavy blaster rifle was slung on his back.
Without saying a word, the squad began to move forward; each step in perfect unison. The formation marched into the large training center and towards the ARC Trooper with red markings on his armor. The formation stopped a few feet away from the clone Captain before Deuce spoke up.
â€œLieutenant Deuce reporting for duty, SIR!â€ The â€˜sirâ€™ was shouted a little louder than the rest of the statement.
**GM Visto** 
Lt. Deuce ~
Cpt. Jaden doesnâ€™t so much as turn in your direction for a solid minute. After what feels like an hour (two minutes) he turns towards the squad and returns Lt. Deuces salute with a crisp motion of his hand. You notice that he himself sports two blasters on his hips and what appears to be a rifle draped across the table. In the background of the training center you can see what AP had called his baby. A heavily modified LAAT/I in which you can clearly see why they he calls himself AP. The beam lasers are mounted in different positions in which they will have superior precision in the field of battle. You also notice his co-pilot already prepping for flight and doing a weapons check.
â€œAP has already been briefed on the squads attack patterns and has advised tactics to assist in the field of battle with 110% efficiency.â€ Jaden says. â€œYour helmet HUDâ€™s have been encrypted to APs flight frequency so you will be able to contact him directly if considered essential. We will run a few simulations to get your squad familiar with drop off and pickups during battle. How to cover a squad mate while they enter and exit a LAAT/i how to recover a fallen brother that isnâ€™t KIA and so on. Get your squad ready and prepare to start the simulation.â€ Jaden snaps a crisp salute and heads to the observation deck to evaluate the exercise. â€œI will be on your tactical channel to advise and give updates as needed. You will maintain the squads honor of being the best damn squad Kal Skirata put together!â€
A few moments later the simulation starts as soon as the lights go out you can see APs LAAT/I lift off and land in front of the squad giving them cover.â€
Over the HUD (Heads up Display) You can see what everyone in your sqaud sees, you can even zero on their whole sight by a blink of an eye. Over the com Jadens voice busrt into the darkness of your helment. "This is Cpt. Jaden to Lt. Deuce...You are to take your squad to drop zone bravo-delta three and provide covering fire for Delta and Alpha squads. Do you copy?"
(After you post add your initiative modifier to the end of it and the simulation will begin)
**Green Dice**
Deuce was always up for a little bit of training. A gallon of sweat saves an ounce of blood, after all.
The simulation started and Deuce was placed in front of APâ€™s LAAT/i. He had his orders and was ready to execute them.
Deuce made a hand gesture indicating that his squad should board the craft. The Lieutenant got aboard as he clicked his comlink on to answer the Captain.
â€œI copy sir. Weâ€™re making for DZ-Bravo-Delta-3 and we are to provide cover fire for Alpha and Delta squadsâ€ Deuce repeated his orders to make sure there were no mistakes.
â€œIf I may ask, sirâ€ Deuce continued to talk to Captain Jaden, â€œWhat are Alpha and Delta squads mission? Are we covering them for an extraction or an advance?â€
Moments after lift-off, Deuce clicks his comlink to APâ€™s frequency.
â€œHow long until we hit the Drop Zone, AP?â€

Lt. Deuce ~
As lieutenant Deuce ask the question about Alpha and Delta squads the comlink buzzes over to AP saying, â€œWhat do you mean how long until get there I have been here for a few minutes now thought you all just wanted to ride along until the simulation was over.â€ You donâ€™tâ€™ know why but you get the feeling that AP has a grin from ear to ear on his face as the comment is made.
Cpt. Jaden comes back over the comlink his voice cool and to the point, â€œYou are to position yourself to lay down covering fire for the two squads for their advancement into the field of battle.â€
Before Lt. Deuce can exit the LAAT/I a small probe droid floats from one of the storage units aboard the ship muttering something in binary. As the droid notices you he starts to wonder where he is and how he got to be here. For some reason you can feel as thou you can read panic in the droidâ€¦
**Green Dice**
Deuce gave AP a thumbs up as he ordered his men to egress from the LAAT/i. He was about to attempt to send the COâ€™s of Alpha and Delta squads a message when a small droid floated past him. It was beeping but it didnâ€™t look threatening.
Deuce dropped from the LAAT/i and found cover with his squad. Quickly, he commed the Captain.
â€œCaptain Jaden, were we issued a probe droid for this mission?â€
While he waited for a response, Deuce popped his head over his cover to gain some situational awareness.
He still saw the small probe droid floating around and it continued to beep and make other noises
I really need to learn to understand these things, Deuce thought to himself.

The droid floats over to Deuce, low to the ground, beeping and whistling, almost as if wondering what's going on. After a moment, a small pod on its right side illuminates, and a hologram appears, containing text.
Code:
I am DRK-1 reconnaissance droid 'DarkSide'.
No mission profile found.

**GM Visto** 
Lt. Deuce & DarkSide ~
Cpt. Jadenâ€™s voice cracks over the com, â€œDeuce that is your scouting unit. Itâ€™s a new concept that is still being tested among squadsâ€¦mainly your squad is the testing ground for the use of this droid series. Now stop jabbing your jaw and with me and get your squad into position to assist already lieutenant!â€
After getting the his surroundings down Lt. Deuce knows he must position his squad to have an advantage of the high ground to be able to assist with covering and suppressive fire as needed. The holo projection of the droid is also giving away your exact location as blaster bolts fly close enough for you to smell where they have landed in close proximity.
(GreenDice I need you to deploy your whole squad as you see fit. I will have their stats posted hopefully soon but you have the jist of what you have in the OOC chat. Also for future reference when DarkSide needs to talk to you he will transmit directly to you HUD and what he says will be translated to basic for you and your squad to read. Since DarkSide can understand basic the comlink will work both ways for you two.)
Jedi ~
Those who have been meditating come out of their trances and find that food as been left near the door for them. You the other padawan (the duros ) has already claimed a tray of food and is sitting next to it and his weapons as if trying to decide whether he wishes to eat or continue inspecting his gear.
**SacredPhoenix** 
Nevlik takes a bite out of his food, enjoying the taste (hopefully), and puts his weapons back onto his belt.
To the other padawans he says "hello, how are you? My name is Nevlik, what's yours?"
**master_Tru**
Roki sits in quite mediation trying not to let his curiosity disrupted his focus. For a time it seems to work, until his muzzle starts to twitch. Roki begins to smell the air around him picking up the aroma of the dish laid out before him. Hunger and curiosity takes over his focus and Roki ceases his meditation opening his eyes.
Chewing down on the food that was brought to him Roki manages a mouth fulled "Hi .... I am Roki ......... glad to have meet you Nevlik." Followed by a smile.
**DarthAnthrax** 
As the voices of the others brings him out of his trance, Torm drops slowly to the floor. He picks up a bit of food and starts to eat.
"I am Torm, master Haarts padawan. Nice to meet you all"
**Green Dice** 
From behind cover, Deuce looked back and forth at his men.
â€œSmudge, youâ€™re with me.â€ Indicating one of his heavy gunners.
â€œTwitch, Trigger, the two of you cover our advancement. One we get to a BFR*, weâ€™ll cover your advancement.â€
Duce turned to the newest addition to his team, the probe droid.
â€œDark Side, is it? We need to protect Alpha and Delta squads and I need your help to locate them. Make me proud, little guy.â€
â€œGet ready for a fight, boysâ€ Deuce pulled his two DC-17s from their holsters. â€œWe move on my mark.â€
While his men (and droid) were readying themselves, Deuce clicked his comlink on to the standard encrypted republic channel.
â€œAlpha Squad, can you read me? Delta squad, can you read me? This is Lieutenant Deuce. I have orders to reinforce your position and I need your location.
â€œRepeat, Alpha and Delta, can you read me?â€
While waiting for a reply, Deuce surveyed the land in front of him to see where he and Smudge could run to.

The hologram vanishes, as DarkSide gives a chirp of acknowledgment, and floats off to begin his reconnaissance.

With your perception check you notice that off to the far left is a "rock" and dead in front of you at a 12 feet (meaning 12 squares) mad dash is a trench. Either way you look at it suppesive fire from your location is a must for any type of advancement. You can't see beyond the trench due to smoke coming from all the guns. You also are unable to reach either Aplha or Delta via comlink. Also don't forget you have control over Ap as well
DarkSide ~
As you slip out into combat it appears as thou you are unnoticed. As you start to scout for the other two teams the hard surface of the floor makes it impossible for you to locate any of their tracks. As for layout the same as prior to Lt. Deuce off to the far left is a BFR that will give cover and at a dead sprint in front of the squad is a trench that could give some cover. Since you are now at the front line in a sense you notice that twelve droids are making their way towards the squad, you are unable to make out what types of weapons they are equipped with or what is bringing up the rear.
Jedi ~
Due to such a long hypersapce travel time it would be wise to get to know your comrades while you can. The Jedi masters are out of contact for they are talking among themselves (as should you) about the events to come. Master Koon is seen around the ship checking equipment and making sure the old ship is holding up under the extreme speed. Every once and a while he comes to the quarters that has been given to to check and see how everyone is doing.
**SacredPhoenix** 
Nevlik continues his conversation with the other two padawans
"Hmm, nice to meet you both, so, what are your feelings about this mission?"
**Green Dice** 
After getting nothing but static after attempting to contact Alpha and Delta squads, Deuce commed AP.
â€œAP, you are our eyes in the sky. Tell me what you see up there buddy. But be careful, intel didnâ€™t mention anything about Anti-Aircraft weaponry in the area but if you start to get shot at, get out of there. You are far too valuable to risk on a cursory reconnaissance run.â€
Popping his head over his cover, Deuce surveyed the area around him. His gaze met a rock on his left and then it fell upon a trench twelve feet away. He looked back and forth between the two a few times before settling on the rock.
â€œSmudge, you and I are making a dash for the BFR on the left. Trigger, Twitch, I need you to provide suppressing fire while we are on the move. Once we are safe, we will provide cover fire for you while you join us.
â€œOnce we are all behind cover, we will repeat the same tactic to get to that trench. By then, AP and Darkside should have some information for us.â€
Deuce nodded at Smudge to indicate he was ready to get going. He gripped his DC-17â€™s a little tighter before leaping out from cover and sprinting towards the BFR.
Although he knew this was a simulation, these missions always got Deuces blood pumping.

Lt. Deuce ~
As you and smudge dart out from your cover blaster blots start to fly from all over. Trigger and Twitch pop up to give suppressive fire but have it laid on them as well. You think to yourself this isnâ€™t a standard mission. You reach the rock at a dead run. Although you where hit by blaster bolts it didnâ€™t impede your dash for cover, Smudge brings up the fear giving Lt. Deuce cover fire and takes a blast to chest sending him to his knees. He is able to make it behind the rock by the time the bombardment comes again.
(Lt. Deuce takes 14 damage and Smudge takes 17 damage)
Trigger and Twitch start for their mad dash as soon as Lt. Deuce and Smudge slant around and provide suppressive fire. Weaving through the battle field Trigger hauls his heavy weapon to join you behind the rock. Twitch isnâ€™t so lucky however as the two were hip and hip Twitch jumped for the trench when the fire was so heavy that it was suppressing his movement. He leans into the trench and starts to take aim at the nearest droid.
AP buzzes over the approaching droids and annihilates three of them. As his beam cannons strike you can see through the smoke that a spider droid is walking up behind the droids. Soon after that you see that two droids kneel down and take aim at the air speeder with what appears to be anti-air weapons.
**Green Dice** 
The pain was hot inside Deuces chest. No matter how many times he had been shot he never got used to it.
However, no matter how much he wanted to sit there and nurse his wounds, he had a mission to carry out.
The three clones huddled behind cover while the squadâ€™s sniper was alone in the trench. Snipers should never act alone. He was proud of his man though. Twitch took quite a beating and he kept firing on the enemy.
Deuce turned to his men.
â€œTake out the pair of droids trying to shoot our ride out of the air. Iâ€™m going to Twitchâ€™s aid.â€
With that, the Lieutenant ran from cover and dove into trench next to his sniper.

Trigger makes short work out of the two anti droids taking them out with a single area shot. Over the com you here a click of confirm on droids being dealt with as ordered. However he wasnâ€™t able to stop them prior to their rockets being launched at AP. The rockets scream into the air and streak after the LAAT/i locking onto its heat source. Smudge starts laying into the Dwarf Spider droid with a full attack but missing the droid completely.
Twitch noticed his CO making way to the trench and laid out covering fire to allow him to make it to the trench. With a running dive Lt. Deuce rolls into the trench and lands next to Twitch. Twitch without taking fire off of the droids says, â€œItâ€™s about time you got that pretty armor of yours dirtyâ€¦sir.â€
**Green Dice** 
Laying face down in the trench, Deuce smiles at Twitches words.
â€œI figured Iâ€™d show you boys I can mix it up with the enemy as well as you can. Besides, they donâ€™t just hand these blue stripes out you know. I needed to earn them. Speaking of whichâ€¦â€

Lt. Deuceâ€™s throwing arm is in pristine condition as he nailed the spider droid dealing 20 points of damage and disabling a few droids that were covering its flank.
The missiles are closing in on AP as he increases his thrust to full to gain more distance. He does a loop in the air and sets and attack run.
**Green Dice** 
As soon as the grenade left Deuceâ€™s hand, he knew it was going to be right on target. He allowed himself to take his eyes off the large droid and gazed up into the sky at his LAAT/i. The twin missiles were streaking towards AP and Deuce held his breath. The pilot performed a perfect loop and avoided the attack.
â€œGreat flying AP! Give us a hand with the little guys while we take down this Spider Droid. If any more droids with rocket launchers show up, they will be our priority target.â€
Bringing his gaze back down to the ground, Deuce was surprised to see the Spider Droid still up and operational.
His right hand went down to his hip and pulled his 2nd DC-17 while he leveled the DC-17 in his left hand at the Spider Droid and squeezed the trigger.

AP sores over your headâ€¦literally. The dust from the trench kicks up all around you and you hear a chuckle over your comlink. The missiles come zipping past not a moment later and after the dust clears a little you can see that AP is on a dead set path for the Spider droid. Your shots pelt the spider droid but does little damage as you hit its armor plating.
As AP raises velocity you can see a true ace at work his ships dodges and maneuvers in ways you have never seen before. He pulls the nose up and sets the speeder at a dive aiming at the droids. A few shots land on the speeder and you can see the shields take the blunt of the blow and die out. The speeder is about to crash from what you can see not knowing that it is all APs skill at the stick. Before the speeder collides with the ground he hits is thrusters and rises with such acceleration that the missiles explode striking the droids dead on.
The spider takes aim and fires at the trench with his cannon. With the trench providing cover the attacks misses only deal half damage (Three damage to you and Twitchâ€¦lol.) Over the com the squads ask for further orders.
**Green Dice** 
Dirt flew in the faces of Deuce and Twitch as the Spider Droidâ€™s beam weapon hit the embankment in front of them. Deuce was worried about what would have happened if that weapon had found its mark.
Seeing the LAAT/i zoom overhead and take out numerous droids brought a smile to Deuceâ€™s face.
He commed his entire squad to issue orders.
â€œThe Spider is going to be a problem, boys. Letâ€™s concentrate fire and take it out!â€
Leveling both DC-17s, Deuce takes aim at the large droid again and hopes his shots penetrate the armor this time.

The small droid flies around the battle field and as you can see what he is sending back to you the rockets that were chasing AP have made a crater in the ground making a small trench about 20ft from the spider droid and its 20ft from the trench as well. The droids from the rear have now taken position in front of the spider droid spreading out and laying down suppressive fire upon the trench and BFR. The spider droid readies its cannon fires and obliterates the BFR sending Smudge and Trigger soaring with the rock fragments.
Lt. Deuce taking time to aim with his blasters and nails the spider droid dead center exploding the center eye sending the droid to the ground in a metal mass of fire and sparks. (Natural 20 doing 38 points of damage) The explosion only takes out one of the other droids that had taken up position around the spider droid leaving six more present.
Not wanting to be shown up Twitch takes aim and sends two more of the droids to the scrap yard leaving four more to be dealt with.
**Voice** 
DarkSide sends a query to AP on board the LAAT, requesting an overhead of the surrounding area, including troop & droid positions where available.
Keeping behind cover wherever possible, he moves away from the strongest concentration of fire continuing his search for the other squads.
(That'll be Stealth(+23) to keep from being spotted, and Perception(+10) to find signs of Alpha & Delta, along with Survival(+8) to track them to their current location as applicable.)
DarkSide's overall route will be to circle around behind the droid army, under the assumption that he'll find A&D squads (or some signs of them) somewhere. He'll continue sending visuals & data about the battlefield to his squad.
OOC: I'm really not getting a good picture of the battlefield, other than that we seem to be in some sort of place where there's 2 big rocks, and a trench.

Finishing his food Roki looks up at the third padawan introducing himself. "Ah my friend I am Roki, it is nice to have meet you ......" Roki gives the individual a sideways look curious that he did not give his name. "The mission yes I have meditated on the matter and it is clouded. Darkness surrounds this mission nothing good will come from it." Roki looks down to the floor a moment lost in thought. "It is not my place to make such assumptions, the force will be our guild and what is meet to be will be so."

As Roki enters the cockpit Master Koon turns around and greets the Bimm warmly. "Is there something I can aid you with padawan?"
ARC Squad~
AP responds back to Lt. Deuce, "All visual on the field nonexistent after that explosion. I'll rise to a higher altitude and see if I am able to pick anything up on the sensors.â€ As he says that you can hear his thrusters engage.
Lt. Deuces shots are dead on target sending two more droids to the ground. Twitch follows suit by placing crack shots into the others.
Trigger and Smudge are disorientated after the explosion but quickly regain their weapons and position behind the rubble. After seeing that the droids are dealt with the make a run to the trench.
DarkSide is able to sneak past the droids by flying low the ground. After clearing the droids that were incoming you can see beyond the smoke that has been released by the droids to cover their advancement. With a clear view DS is able to peer out without any limitations on the dusty battlefield. With the debris falling all around DS makes out the position of the other squads. One team is covering the other while they extract vital information.

With that the room returns back to white and you can see Cpt. Jaden running down from the observation deck. Over the tactical com issuing orders to the squad and calling in AP to land so they may board and make way to the launch bays.

Master Koon seems to think on Roki's question for a moment then turns and replays what Master Obi-wan had sent to the high council. "It would appear as thou we are on a rescue mission padawan. It is not often that the jedi are captured and treated as spys for the Repbulic. I do not know if war will be the outcome but I will face any danger to help a fellow jedi if I am able to."

Still in a bow Roki takes a few steps back. "I will assemble the padawans master Koon thank you for you time. May the force be with you master."
Roki exits and heads for the quarters he had left the other padawans. Despite master Koon`s words Roki can not help but to remember master Windu`s words of a confirming a creation of a clone army.

Trigger helps Smudge up from their dive into the trench that no longer surrounds them. looking for his commander he jogs over to him where he stands at attention and waits for orders. As he stands he watches AP land his craft waiting for the chance to show his skill in real battle.

The simulation ended with a bang. Mostly due to Darksideâ€™s grenade.
Captain Jadenâ€™s voice could be heard through Deuces helmet comlink. The order was given to head to the launch tubes for further instructions and Deuce didnâ€™t hesitate to comply.
**â€œAlright boys, Great Job! The better we perform in here, the better we perform out there. And apparently, something has come up where we may be able to put our skills to the test.
â€œForm up so we can get out of here.â€**
Deuce waved up in the air at the circling LAAT/i.
**â€œAP, we ready for a pickup.â€** 
While the squad was waiting, Darkside floated up to Deuce and apologized for its performance.
**â€œWhat are you talking about Darkside?â€** Deuce said quizzically.
**â€œYou successfully snuck up on a group of droids and sent them all to their Maker. That is a victory in my book. If the simulation hadnâ€™t ended, Iâ€™m confident you would have tracked down Alpha and Delta.â€**
Deuce boarded the LAAT/i after his men. He wondered what good news the Captain had for him and his squad.

Deuce read the text as it scrolled up on his HUD.
**â€œYou found them. So you succeeded more than I thought. You were just unable to tell me their coordinates before the simulation ended.
â€œRemember, a real battle doesnâ€™t just end abruptly because Captain Jaden or one of those Kaminos hit a button. They end when you get me the proper information so that my boys and I can do our job. If this simulation had gone on, as it would have if it were a real battle, you would have performed admirably. Iâ€™d rather you â€œfailâ€ during training as long as I know you will do your duty when we are actually getting shot at.â€**

Jedi~
The ship handles exceptionally well under while under the control of Master Koon and Korl. As you peer out of the window in your room you can see asteroids passing by as the ship skims through the field. You feel the ship breaking atmosphere. Master Koon exits the ship and transmits to the rest of the council that he has landed on target and will proceed with the plan. The jedi masters look upon their padawans with both confidence and sorrow. In each of their own way they say their mission to accompany Master Koon to a location within this planet as his protectors. The mission is reconnaissance to see how large this so called droid army is and then report the findings.
ARC Squad~
Cpt. Jaden Steps up onto the LAAT/i last and then informs AP that all is aboard. As the words leave his mouth AP is already in route to the hanger bay. As he flies over the bay to the target location you can see companies marching as one unit. Itâ€™s a sight for all to see perfect unison as thousands of men board capital ships. Cpt. Jaden points to a landing pad while talking into his helm and AP lands as a little greenâ€¦thing walks with cane over to the landing pad accompanied by the Prime Minister. The small creature walks up to the ship and for such a small creature he can jump pretty high as he lands on the ship and continues walking without missing a beat. He turns to the prime minister saying in broken basic, â€œFine, this will do. Genosis, make haste we will.â€ The Prime Minister says take care master Jedi this squad is one of our best, with that said Cpt. Jaden gives the command and AP takes the ship airborne kicking in the thrusters to keep the ship from rockingâ€¦a little less. He heads to a capital ship that is in orbit. Soon after the capital ships hits light speed and you have sometime before you the destination is reached.

Floating over toward the short green Jedi Master (Yoda), DarkSide whistles and beeps to attract the Jedi's attention while he sends another query to Deuce's HUD.

```

Query:
We have been assigned a new mission?
I still have no data.
What are the parameters?

Deuce watched in awe as they flew over the mass of marching clones. He knew there were a lot of clones but he never realized how many. Rank after rank of soldiers poured into capital ships. Groups of walkers were loaded onto landing craft. Even airspeeders like the one they were flying on now, zipped around. Deuce knew the Kaminoans were responsible for the creation of the clone army but he wondered about who manufactured all these war machines. He quickly dismissed it with a shrug. All that mattered was that the machines were here.
Deuce smiled as he thought about what a grand army he was a part of.
After AP landed their LAAT/i on the landing pad, Deuce stood at perfect attention behind Captain Jaden. The captain spoke to the short green alien and the Prime Minister and Deuce silently beamed as the squad was referred to as â€œone of the bestâ€.
Deuce whispered into him comlink to respond to Dark Sideâ€™s query.
**â€œI donâ€™t know Dark Side. I donâ€™t have any data to give you. As soon as I know something, you will know too.â€**
The LAAT/i zipped away from the landing pad and towards their new home for the immediate future: A capital-scale battleship.
Aboard the capital ship, Deuce tried to maintain some sense of normalcy in his routine. He still spent time at least an hour in the gym a day and he ran 2 miles every morning. He made sure to spend some time in his office to address any concerns from his men or be accessible to Captain Jaden. Most of the time spent in the office was used trying to find out more about the planet Geonosis that the short green alien mentioned.
The worst part about being on the ship was not knowing what his mission was.

The time for simulations is over, the time for live fire has begun and they will not show us mercy, as for we will show them none in return. We are being sent to stop a large hostile force that has taken presence upon the planet known as Geonosis where factories are stationed. Although our brothers will be dealing with the droid army at first we are being sent with Jedi Master Yoda to rescue a senator of the galactic republic, a jedi master and his padawan. Our first priority is the senator followed by the two jedi. Master Yoda has informed us that a team of jedi was dispatched a few hours before us for the same attempt so we will assist them if needed. That are our orders as of this time, further orders will be given after our primary orders are achieved.

Knowing now that he's getting dropped into another hot firefight, DarkSide radios in a requisition for a reload of his grenades, and hovers off to find the supplies.
As soon as he's done with that, he'll do what he can to gather as much information about the planet, it's terrain, inhabitants, etc. as he is able to in the time available. [Gather Information(+8) and/or Computer Use(+2) (untrained)]
Following that, as they get more information about the specifics, he'll work on approach tactics to minimize his exposure, while maximizing his field of view. [Knowledge(tactics)(+8)] He'll relay his plan of attack to Deuce.
*OOC: Since I know essentially what we're getting into here, I'm figuring DarkSide's approach tactic will be to essentially bail early, and fight from the rim of the arena, but that's subject to change if his K(t) check reveals a better plan, or a flaw that *I'm* not seeing.*

**â€œOk gang, get anything youâ€™ll need. Double check ammo and grenades. Then check them again. AP, how our ride? Do you need a hand doing a pre-flight check?â€**
Deuce sounded like a concerned parent making sure his children are ready for their first day of school. He looked at his four troops and his droid and smiled. He was proud of them and he was confident that they would all perform their duties when the blaster bolts were flying.
**â€œForm up near the LAAT/i in forty minutes. Now what are you waiting for!? Get out of here! GO! GO! GO!â€**
Deuce loved his job.
The Lieutenant quickly went over his ammunition inventories before heading over to the LAAT/i.

The rolls were to see what Deuce knew or could find about Geonosis in the ships computer. Sorry, I should have been more clear.

Jedi~
You descend into the wasteland of Geonosis. The heat goes from warm to hot by the passing minutes. Along the way you see no signs of life, no sign of anyone on this rock other then the group you are walking with at the moment. As you draw nearer to the cliffs you notice that giant holes are cut into them and resemble little make shift houses. You come to a point where the only way to go is down. After a few moments a narrow path is found and everyone starts to slowly walk the path downwards.
ARC Squad~
((**Skill Check +25**: Geonosis is the production center for most of Baktoid Armor Workshopâ€™s droids, a harsh world, with a dry climate and periodic solar radiation storms. The planet is not located on any major trade routes, and the native Geonosians are not particularly welcoming to visitors. As a result, the planet is rarely visited by outsidersâ€¦
Also through looking for information in various ways (other than gather information) you find that Geonosians are an insectoid species with some having the ability to fly due to wings on their backs. ))
AP responds to Deuce, â€œYou think Iâ€™m going to let some hot shot lieutenant with a gun touch my babiesâ€™ controls! You can hear a soft chuckle over the com from the rest of the squad, AP comes back over the com, â€œI mean no thanks Iâ€™ll keep her warm and ready for immediate departure!â€
As Lt. Deuce dismisses the squad some of them stay as they are ready to go and some leap off and head with the Lieutenant to refill their ammo.

Trigger is unsure of what he feels. For all the training and preparation he never expected to actually be called into battle. As his Lt. made orders for him to follow he obeyed, knowing the only difference between training and now, was death. He thought about what this meant for the state of affairs in the republic and realised he was fine with the way it was. He was created for this, trained and tested from day one. Now he would prove that he was worth every moment of training and second helping at the Mess Hall. Lt, Duece issues the dismissal order,
"Sir!" Trigger salutes and quickly begins checking his guns and ammo, insuring that they are loaded and functioning properly.
"Lt. Duece, If I may speak freely a moment?" Questions Trigger.

As the path narrows, Torm can sense the others reaching outwards through the Force, searching for threats. He decdes to add his mind to theirs, and reaches outwards through the Force. Falling into a near-trance, he expands his cosciousness further away, seeking the minds of his kin that are following with master Windu.
((As we walks, make a Perception check (+8, low-light vision) enhanced by Sense Surroundings (+8).

As each of you attempt to sense through the force you gain no information. You feel as thou no one (living) is around you in hiding. (Doesn't mean you sense droids fyi lol) You all feel alone on this planet with your masters at your side being lead by Master Koon to the unknown. Seaching for other ways down has been a failure and you all must now decend the cliff by climbing down. The masters tie off some ropes to the ship as an anchor and instruct the padawans to decend.
Torm- Master Windu would have been auto no so you sensed a padawan that you have meet a few times in the temple. You feel he is trying to be brave but is scared out of mind about what is going to happen. Around him is many other jedi on what appears to be a transport that has just entered the system. Master Windu can be heard talking to everyone and you feel the padawans heart beat slow down, you feel him literally take breaths and regain some of the strength in his legs.

In exactly twenty minutes the squad is all present and accounted for. The Jedi master address the squad, as he begins to speak the squad snaps to attention out of habit for a commanding officer. "Save the remaining jedi we must when we arrive we if able we are. Fall in battle will many, both jedi and your brothers. Thank you for your service and...dedication I do." As the jedi master speaks you feel the pride he express and the sorrow in his voice as well. "Standing orders for all troopers this is that are head with us. Droid factories the others will focus on. The droid army that will advance on us as we land the main force will attack.
The ship drops out of hyperspace and the alarm sounds to prepare for depature. AP checks the squad status and signels that squad ((Name needed)) is ready and waiting.

As Torm streches out into the Force, he feels little around him, the close surroundings seemingly lifeless. Not a surprise though, and certainly not a reason to relax. The Separatists were known to use battle droids after all. As he seeks his fellow jedi, he touches a familiar mind, that of a young padawan. He senses the others nervosity, and tries to lend some of his strength to the other. Then he starts his downward climb along with the others, calling upon the Force to steady his body whenever he misses his grip.

Standing at attention in front of his men, Deuce let the words of the small green alien wash over him. They were a little difficult to understand at times but he got the gist of the meaning. Deuce wondered if the little guy suffered from an illness or something that affected the speech region of the brain.
He had a sadness in his voice that Deuce couldnâ€™t quite wrap his head around. He and his men were created to fight. Here was the chance for him to prove himself in a real fight and here this alien was getting all teary eyed. Maybe he was getting all choked up because the clone army was better than he realized it would be?
Deuce stopping thinking about it. All he cared about were the standing orders for him and his squad. How were they going to save this group of Jedi?
-------------------------
Aboard the capital ship, Deuces stomach lurched as they reverted to realspace. Just like in training, Deuce supervised his squad board the LAAT/i before he got aboard himself.
**â€œCheck your equipment!â€** Deuce shouted to his men over the rumbling of the LAATâ€™s engines.
Deuce checked his weapons, armor, utility belt and anything else he needed while his men did so as well.
**â€œIf anyone needs to go to the bathroom, youâ€™ll have to wait until we are on the ground!â€** Deuce joked just before he heard AP over the comm.
**â€œOf course we are the first AP,â€** Deuce called to his pilot. **â€œWe are squad *Werdaâ€™denla*, and the top brass is going to hear our name a lot!â€**

The masters are to far up the mountain for their powers to reach the young padawan. Master Koon having already started to descend looks over to see Roki slip. As Roki falls darkness surrounds him as he dissappears down the side of the mountain...
ROki finds himself scared out his bimmy little mind rolling down the mountain and over the edge. Fear washes over his face and then at the same time peace overtakes you as you tap into your trainning. As you find peace from within your butt finds contact with the ground and you realize that your grip slipped at the end of your descent.

A little more then embarrassed Roki looks down for a moment then picks up a small round rock. "Hey look its my lucky day" Roki boasts cheerfully a small attempt to lighten the mood. Pocketing the small rock Roki takes master Koon`s offer of aid. Dusting himself off Roki looks around.

Jedi~
As everyone finds out that Roki is ok a laughter fills the group and Master Koon coms up to the other masters and lets them know that everyone is ok. You find yourselves standing in front of a cave entrance. As each you look into the darkness Master Koon starts to say, "That is the path we must take in order to meet up with the others." Before he can finish the sentence a bombardment of laser fires starts to pelt the cliff side. You see the rope start to fall and can hear a scream. Master Koon waste no time and thrust everyone into the cave and ives in behind them just as the cave entrances closes with rocks and debris falling in front of it.
ARC Squad~
The squad roars with laughter as Lt. Deuce comments to what the squad had started calling "Floating doom" due to DarkSide being sneaky and launching grenades. Cpt. Jaden keeps a firm tone, "Keep frosty men we are heading into live combat. Now isn't the time for jokes about droids who have percision to kill. Those of us who will exit will form a sphere defense around the hull of the ship. Our heavy gunners will stay on the ship and support the ground troops Lt. Deuce and Smudge will take the Portside (left) and Trigger and I will take the starboard (right). The droid will aim at what isn't considered Republic issued or Jedi and make sure they aren't moving after he moves onto his next target."
Fifteen minutes untill deployed. The hanger bays open louding reveilling for the first time Geonosis to the clone army. Over the comlink, "Ready to enter atmosphere and deploy general!" comes a clones voice although is simliar sounding has its own destinctions within it. The small jedi master speaks, "Now!, will the clone army deploy."

Barely before Torm can register that Roki was indeed okay does the laser rain starts. Toghether with the others, he scrambles into that cave right before it collapses around them. Taking a few moments to adjust himself, he spies around the cave they have entered, with both his eyes and the Force.

As the dust settles around the group silence ensues within the darkness. As your senses come back to everyone you can hear the pelting of blaster fire against the mountainside. Soon after a blue lightsaber comes to life revealing Nevliks curious face as he struggles to see in the darkness of the gave.
((Note that now he has his lightsaber ignited the Kel'dor in the party can use their low light vision))
As Torm reaches out his senses to any danger none is found. It appears to be just a cave with a tunnel extending forward into the mountain.
Roki is unable to reach out through the force to find his master...
You all feel a disturbance in the force...
Master Koon speaks saying, "We must continue on with our mission we have no time to look into the pst for answers that will be reveiled in the future." He then starts to walk down the tunnel with the padawans in tow.

Deuce listened to the orders being handed down from Captain Jaden to his squad. Despite being his direct supervisor, Deuce never did get comfortable with the Captain giving his squad orders directly. This was not the time to think about it though.
Deuce gripped both of his pistols and eased them out of their holsters. As if on cue, the armored side panels on the LAAT/i slid open to reveal the reddish brown battlefield below.
*This place could be the location of our greatest gloryâ€¦. Or our final grave*
Deuce morbidly thought to himself.
Almost as a reaction, Deuce pulled his gaze away from the landscape and back towards his men. He was afraid he would never see them again.
Deuce scanned the helmets of his men slowly before stopping at his sniper. Twitch had not said much of anything since they left Kamino and Deuce was a bit concerned. The last thing they needed now before heading into their first live combat situation was a soldier who was going to freeze up on the ground and become a liability.
Deuce opened up a secure comlink connection with the sniper.
**â€œHey Twitch, whatâ€™s the matter? Is your head in the game?â€** Deuce tried getting his attention.
**â€œLook, I want you to exit the port side of the LAAT when we land and stick close to me and Smudge, ok?â€**

The path comes to a fork and darkness looms over each seperate way. Master Koon studies for a moment each different path and turns to the padawans. "It is time for me to part ways with you" he says in his humble way. "The path to the left is to the mission that was to be assigned to you and your masters, now that they are no longer with us I place this task in your hands. I do this knowing that your masters have trained you to be strong jedi and would not have accepted this mission if they didn't beleive that you all could carry on in their absence. Take this path and find the droid control ship that lays within the mountain side. Destroy what you can but be warned it will be guarded with many droids. May the force be with all of you" With those parting words he turns and heads down the path to the right and walks into the darkness until you are unable to see him.

As the LAAT/i's make planetside ten split off with AP in the formation. Guided by only what the Jedi Master tells him Jaden directs the lead LAAT/i towards what appears to be a mountain.

Jedi~
As the three padawans creep down the left path the sounds of millions of machines steadily grows louder and louder until you find yourselves overlooking a half submerged droid factory. With the factory at full production lights shoot out from every crack illuminating the cavern. With the lower half submerged into the mountain you can see droids filing out headed into the mountain towards the direction master Koon was headed. As it stands the path you followed lead to a cliff above the droids that are marching so none of the droids on the ground level have noticed you as of yet. After a few moments you see the factory doors close and the droids start to disappear into the darkness of the cave with only the sound of their metal clanking.
To preempt the perception checks that are going to be asked for (I made my farseeing checkâ€¦lol) the droids consisted of **Five Super Battle Droids** leading **fifteen to twenty Battle droids**. Bringing up the rear you see droidekaâ€™s rolling in and out of the formation. From what you observe of the droids five â€œsquadsâ€ headed into the mountain so you all are unable to make an accurate account of exactly how many droids are headed towards the direction of Master Koon.
ARC Squad~
â€œT-minus five minutes until extraction point Alpha-Zero-Niner is reached.â€ comes APâ€™s voice over the helmets comlinks. As Lt. Deuce motions with his hand the squad falls into position around the doors of the LAAT/i. Trigger and Smudge latch onto the ships frame at the sides of the LAAT/I that Jaden had ordered them to so that they are able to lean out for shots and be able to maintain balance as the ship moves around. DarkSide is still floating up the in corner of the ship preventing any dust from entering his systems.
As Lt. Deuce turns to check and see if his squad is ready he automatically knows that they are without having to justify it with his eyes. Smudge being the first clone to see action leans into his brace ready for action. Lt. Deuce hugs the doorway and notices that Twitch is leaning against the shipâ€™s hull as if bored and ready for something...anything to happen. As you start to scold him about being prepared for some reason once again you just know that itâ€™s his way of being prepared. For the first time Lt. Deuce you notice the differences that each clone in your squad shows and they make each of you unique.

As the LAAT/i breaks the mountain top you all can see a truly epic battle between Jedi and Droids. Many have fallen on both sides with the jedi taking the bigger blow due to driods being able to be replaced easier. "A perimeter around the surviors create!" shouts the Jedi Master. AP maneuvrs the LAAT/i into position. Cpt. Jaden is the first to hit the ground out of the LAAT/i as it in his training to be the first among his men to enter the field of battle on foot.

He hides, keeping low, poking his forward sensors just over the rim of the railing and surveys the scene before him.

Roki leads the padawans to the entrance where the droids marched out. It seems strange that a factory full of droids would be left unguarded. Moving as quickly and quietly as they can our padawans take up position on either side of the door. While moving forward you can see support beams shoved into the mountain side along the base of the factory.
As Roki searches out with the force to detect if anything thing is watching them a flash of pain shoots through his mind as he gets a vision of Master Sol fighting for his life against a droid with sparks flying out of his leg.
Vengeful Shadows~
As Dark Side bails out of the ship he barely manages to make a soft landing on the hard mountain rim. Moving quickly and quietly Dark Side manages to get to a point that gives him a little cover and is able to see the battle before him. As the LAAT/iâ€™s make their approach into the arena Dark Side has a perfect view of clones in action. He sees the squads captain jump out in a defensive position and the start firing at anything that isnâ€™t a clone or jedi. Lt. Deuce follows suit on the other side of the ship with the squad mimicking their officers.
LT. Deuces shots hit their marks and sends four droids to their maker. In doing so made himself a target for the droids taking 20 damage and dropping down on your condition track.
Trigger jumps from the other side of the LAAT/i and starts to lay out fire on approaching super battle droids melting two of them down. The droids fire upon Trigger dealing twenty-five damage (21 from one a 4 from the other) dropping you also down the condition track.
Dark Side delaying his action to support where he is needed fires a grenade at the entrance where more droids seem to be coming and decimates three regular droids leaving the rest to fire upon his position. Leveling their wrist blasters upon Dark Side the Super Battle droids score a critical hit upon Dark Side dealing a total of (20 x2 for critical) forty damage and dropping your down on your condition track. (Need to know if you wish to spend a force point to be moved from dead to desperate need of repairs please)
Smudge from his cover on the LAAT/i opens fire upon the droids and takes out a few more. As the super battle droids return fire they are unable to hit smudge as he ducks into the speeder for cover.
Twitch is nowhere to be seen with only half a clone helmet resting where he was last positioned.

OOC: DarkSide spends a Destiny Point to completely negate that attack. One other thing. When DarkSide next attacks, he'll be using the 'snipe' option of Stealth, allowing him to fire without giving away his position. Because he'll be firing from an unknown position, he should get to take advantage of his Dastardly Strike talent, pushing any droids he doesn't destroy 2 steps down the condition track instead of just 1.

In a flash of smoke and shower of rubble, the Super Battledroid's quick shots narrowly miss their mark, providing DarkSide with the cover he needs to sink out of sight and move to another position.

The squad tears apart the remainning driods with ease. Mostly due to the stratigic withdrawl to the LAAT/i for cover.
Cpt. Jaden gives the order to clear out and the squad reacts with haste. With a few hand movements the squad pulls back to the LAAT/i and starts to provide covering fire to those remainning. When AP is about to pull out Jedi Master Plo Koon orders the LAAT/i to land near an entrance to one of the caves. Ap does as ordered lands the LAAT/i with the door open to the cave and deploys the squad. Lt. Deuce, Trigger and Dark Side and the rest of the squad are to recon the tunnel and find a missing group of commanders (padawans) and assist them in their mission if their are still alive.
As the sqaud gets ready to enter the tunnel at a rapid run you all see Twitch running over with something over his shoulder. Running behind Twitch is a giant creature no one has seen before, head bowed and horns red with blood and black due to the blaster fire that has been pelted into its thick hide charges the LAAT/i.
Jedi~
As noted prior you are the factory door entrance hiding on either side. From your perception checks prior you notice that since this factory is lodged into the mountain side their are many support beams shoved into the mountain side keep it up right in a sense. So I need to know what actions you all are going to take. If you are unsure of your choices there are only a few. 1) You can enter the factory by force
2) Take out the support beams and see if anything else is on the other side of the factory
Note there are great risk with either choice made but one must be made soon please.

Trigger without hesitation rains fire upon the Reek as it charges. The creature didn't have a chance with a clone trooper saving one of his own. The creatures head explodes as the energy bolts make contact sending the reek to the ground as a smoking lump. Dark Side enters the tunnel with haste trying to get a layout of the tunnel feeding the information back to the squad.

Torm and Roki stab their lightsabers into the door and start to peel it open. As soon as the door starts to open blaster bolts spit out of the other side sending both padawans to either side of the wall while they still cut.

DarkSide checks for tracks in the layer of dust and dirt on the ground of the tunnel. [Full-round action: Survival(+8), est. DC 13]
If he finds Jedi tracks, he follows them. (duh)
If he finds any droid tracks from only one direction, he follows the *opposite* path, reasoning that if the droids had crossed paths with the Jedi, then either the droids or the Jedi would not have been able to continue their trek.
If he does not find tracks, or finds tracks from both directions, he continues going straight, reasoning that the left-side fork is likely to lead to other tunnels leading to and from the arena itself.

Torm its to far away to make it to the middle of the room where the generator is it's at least six move actions from the door to the middle and you've only moved two times. Running attack if I am not mistaken means you can attack and finsih your move action if any remains not giving extra movement. Only charging does that.
Roki's hand singes as the energy is gathered in his little palm smoke rises from his hand as he barly manages to absorb the blaster bolts. No droids are close enough to swing at a move action you forsee in order to be effictive.
ARC Squad~
Dark Side it will take a double move in order to even reach the area where the jedi are as you only are hearing a blaster fight coming from within the factory at the moment.

Think of the room as a large circle within the droid factory. In the middle of the room is what appears to be a giant generator. The room is only 12 move actions in diameter so it only takes a total of 6 move actions to reach the generator. Droids are all over the room as this room is heavily guarded. You all broke through the south door taking out a few of the droids on the way to the reactor The walls a lined with turrets that are firing as well as the droids. The team hasn't reached the reactor to see what is near gurading it or what is near it to attempt to disable the factory. For the purpose of how many droids are in the room with you there is a lot approx twenty still standing between Torm and the generator and more coming in the door each round. There is no cover once you leave the hallway where Nevlik has been shooting from.

Before Nevlik can blink (that is if duros do blink <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: --> ) the door explodes as the droids that where shooting at Nevlik send fragments of metal in all directions dealing Nevlik 8 points of debris damage. Nevlik raises his head and sees a small droid coming up from behind him with moving fast. A few steps behind the droid is a sight to behold, a group of armored men comes running in the wake of the droid and take up position around Nevlik and start to fire in the room with precision hitting the droids trying to flank our bimm friend Roki. One of these men whose armor is not like the rest kneels near Nevlik.
"Commander are you injured?â€ Not waiting for Nevlik to respond the man in armor with blue markings makes a few hand movements and another man whose armor is white with green markings takes up position near Nevlik. Overhearing the conversation Nevlik picks up, "Trigger you are to secure the jedi commanders and make sure they are extracted starting with him." Pointing at Nevlik.

Blaster bolt after blaster bolt hit Torm but the young kelâ€™dor advances on ignoring the pain pushing on with his mission. ((8 Damage to Torm))
Roki seeing his fellow padawan in danger becomes a blur of fur. Running towards Torm at full speed Roki takes a quick slash at a droid as he passes by.

Dark Side launches a grenade at the generator. The grenade explodes upon it and you can see that the generator is still working just has a nice dent on it now. Some droids turn onto Dark Sides position and place fire upon him. You receive no indication that AP received your update the com is dead.
Lt. Deuce runs forward towards the two reckless padawans taking out a few droids along the way. Coming up behind Roki and Torm the figure in white armor towering over them both speaks with a tone of authority, â€œCommanders! Itâ€™s time to leave and I am here to see that you do so.â€ With a few gestures the rest of the squad lays out some cover allowing the three to tactically withdraw. To his squad via helmet comlink, "Cease Fire on the generator that is not our mission or any part of our objective. If it blows it will take everyone here with it. Standing orders is to withdraw with the commanders walking on their feet or being carried!"
As the three attempt to pull back the ground shakes violently and our party falls to the ground. A few droids fall but most are still standing. Trigger and Nevlik can see the mountain side start to pass them by. A distinct clatter is heard echoing throughout the room as five droidekaâ€™s take position around the generator. Their shields have a distinct blue glow that allows them to be seen.

DarkSide sends a response to Deuce:

```

Acknowledged.
Lieutenant.  Move out.
I will cover your escape.
Move fast.  I cannot contact the gunships.

```

Then, tosses a grenade into the mass of droids closest to the two stubborn Jedi, being careful to keep the Jedi out of the blast radius, and begins moving toward the door. (DarkSide will be the last 'living' member of the team to go through the door.)
Note: 2 grenades left.

Blaster bolts flies all around TormÂ´s head, and he can only barely keep the most lethal from putting him down for good. Sprinting alongside Roki though, he has all but reached the genator station, when suddenly aa powerful explosion erupts among the driods, taking several of them down. From the smoke, a white-armoed figure appears, telling them to back off. Taking a quick moment to catch his breath, Torm hangs his hand holding his lightsaber a little lower.
"I donÂ´t know who you are, but unless we do something about this thing, a lot more Jedi will die today than what will happen if we blow it up"
Scanning for a weak point in the generator, something that will cripple it, sever the power flow, or simply interfer with its functionality, he readies himself to make a final strike.
Suddenly the ground erupts in violent shakes, and he looses his balance, falling prone. As he scrambles to his feet, he both hears and spots several mechnical terrors rolling out and forming a perimeter around the generator.
*Oh, no….droidekas…*
Seeing the futility in keeping up a direct assault, Torm takes a few steps backwards, holding his saber up between him and the destroyer droids.
((First a Swift ACtion to use Second Wind (regaining 14 Hp). Then a Move Action to get up from prone (damn tremors). Then a Standard Action (Perception +8) to locate any point on the generator that might serve to incapacitate it without blowing everything up, because that would be **really** stupid))

Its hard to stay on your feet as this factory now plumets to the ground. Wind whisltes through the open door the jedis tatters robes slash across them. The duros jedi Nevlik and the little Bimm Roki are first to jump out of the factory followed shortly by Trigger and Voice, Triggers weapon still in hand. Air fills out the padawans robes as they now see that the factory only started to drop as they jump. Torm reluctent to jump finds a boot in his rear as the soldier clad in white armor marked with blue nudges him out and follows after.
From this height everyone has a nice view of the battle going on around them. For the jedi they now see a massive army of men donned in white armor fighting a giant battle against droids of all sorts.

Air rushes past your faces or screen in Dark Sides point of view. The massive army moves as one from wht you can see. The jedi seem to have taken in their fear by using the force to help them stay calm, the soldiers in white are battle hardend and knew to prepare for anything, the droid on the other hand can be see bleeting and beeping anything and everything that he can as he plummets to the ground. Trigger attempts to stow his weapon but his grip on the weapon slipped and it fell from him. The group sees another factory hit the ground and send a massive dirt cloud out in all directions.
Wind blows into the teary eyed face of a young female as she clings to a blood covered lightsaber. The ship that picked her up from what she heard was called a LAAT/i or laty. It looks as thou it has taken critical damage and the young jedi wonders how this pilot can still fly the ship. Across the way sits a young man who is covered in black smoke as if a droid exploded in face and grease and oil blew all over him. In the back of the laty is a make shift medbay with a one legged man hooked up and is stable. As the young female whips her eyes she see's a man in white armor with blue strips falling and before him a young kel'dor in jedi robes as she tries to look closer at the people falling a dirt cloud engulfs the ship.

Doesn't take a move action to talk just fyi, need to know what your using the sense surroundings for please. You think you saw something falling but was unable to see exactly what it was due to the dust cloud that engulfed the speeder.

With a sharp bank towards the dust cloud the pilot takes the busted up laty towards the dust cloud.
ARC pilot: "This ship won't last much longer on the field of battle we need to land before it lands for us. You'll have one pass at whatever it is you think is in there."
The LAAT/i moves swiftly into the dust cloud, Kryser can sense a life form faintly that feels like an excited child.

Thinking fast kryser thinks about his jedi training and knows he needs to be fast to save lives of the other jedi. So as the laty turns he shoots his liquid cable dispenser twice at the bottom of the ship to make something that he thinks could help catch certain people if the dont have rope on them. Then he readies to catch anything that the laty passes near.
occ 1 swift for liquid cable to hang down from the laty, 2nd swift same thing so theres two ropes hanging down 10 squares under the laty, readied standard action to grab the next person to pass near the laty.

Keyser pulls a small dispenser from his belt and leans out the side ot the LAAT/i, taking aim as to not hinder any parts under the speeder he places the cable in position and drops the dispenser making a short rope.
(Kryser you only have one Liqued Cable Dispenser listed on your sheet and the book has it at only being able to fire 15 meters or 10 squares. Made it the long version instead of two shorts. Please remove the LCD from your sheet.)
After attaching the cable Kryser and Marina tie themselves off as to not be pulled out themselves and lean out attempt to grab the falling keldor and the trooper.
((Going to look at is a grab attempt from both parties so I need Kryser and Marina to post and then Torm for this first attempt. Torm you can see the ship thanks to your nifty kel dor goggles not hindering your sight during the storm.

Deciding his gun is less important than his life, Trigger gives up on trying to grab the stupid thing. Guns are easier to replace than troops after all, Even with a Million clones in production. Hearing something going on above him he orients his fall to try and see whats going on through the dust, hoping his helmet might help him catch something his eyes might not see. Hoping its a flyable ship ( Friendly or not) he pulls out his LCD and turns his comm on (Military Channel).
"This is Sergeant Trigger of the Vengeful Shadows, requesting pick up from Mid-Air Location, Any Takers?" Looking up again he thinks he sees something, but with all this dust it could be, well, maybe it really IS something. It sounds like it, at least.

Through an opening in the side of the ship, she can see a female leaning out towards him, reaching out. Doing his best to control his fall, Torm does whatever he can to reach her.

Having no means to do anything else, DarkSide continues to plummet toward his inevitable doom.
OOC: With two people on board the LAAT attempting to rescue the fallers, it'll be at *least* 6 rounds to rescue all the falling characters. After the 3rd round of falling, they'll be falling faster than 2 move actions on the part of the LAAT will allow, so it'll have to do a straight-line vertical *dive* (running) to catch up with us. 6 rounds of moving at those speeds if it hasn't plowed into the terrain, then somehow the factory ship was moving *much* faster than the LAAT can, without anybody not looking at the door being aware of it until it started to fall.
Spotted the references to the factory ship moving:
- Round N, we all jumped out.
- Round N-1, we all felt the ship stop moving up and begin to fall.
- Round N-2, the floor shook. (the ship took off?)
Given that chain of events, we've already hit the ground 2 rounds *after* jumping out.

Torm finds himself staring up at young man who has a firm grasp on his forearm and is using all his might to pull the keldor into the speeder. Marina feels as a strong grasp come upon her as a soldier with blue markings on his unique armor pulls himself into the LAAT/i with her assistance.
As the small black droid continues to plummet bleeping and hooting the whole way, Triggers cable shoots up into the storm and finds his mark although he barly hit the moving speeder.
Nevlik centers himself and through the force finds the answer he was looking for, a small cyndiler that is moving towards him as he calls it with the force. (Move light Object) As the young durose grips onto the cable he feels something small cling to his leg for all its might.

(( Not sure how heavy the droid is, but hoping I can use Move Light Object on him; UtF +8 ))

Having twisted about to find his flying savior, Trigger notices a black Ball of droid Hurtling towards him from slightly above. Reinforcing his grip on his LCD (Either Attaching it to his belt or wrapping his arm in its "cable") He reaches for the droid, hoping to catch a piece of the little black bombadier.
"Not so fast Dark!" He hollers as the droid approaches.

Not sure what to roll here, but I'm going to go with grapple: +6. Here's hoping.

Marina is unable to move the droid as he is not a light object.
Trigger reaches for Dark Side fingers attempting to grasp the small droid at any possible point but his fingers are unable to grasp anything upon the droid to maintain a grip. Dark Side dissappears into the dust cloud.
Roki scuttles up Nevlik in a flash of fur and is inside the speeder as if he used surge to climb the makeshift rope. ( <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: --> ) As he enters he can sense a pressence in the back of the speeder and Torm standing over in that area.
Torm the man is too badly injured for you to determine who he is and you get no answer from the two jedi in the speeder as they have no idea who he is either. You assume that the speeders mission was the recover this person and in doing so was the reason for its damaged hull.
Nevlik is swinging from the cable rope enjoying the view of the giant dust cloud. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
(Well wrap up this chapter as soon as Dark Side is saved or kaput and dish out expereince. With that note that I don't do individual expereince in my games and its usually straight forward with roleplay, Challange Levels, and completed task or mission.)
((Edited due to Voices post on wanting out of the game for his reasons. Everyone (except Alica and Kryser) get a solid 4k exp for various events in role playing, defeating CLs and mission completes. Alica and Kryser get 500 exp for role play at the end of this chapter. Update your characters and let me know so I can check them over for everyone.))

Not giving up on the droid Trigger keeps the current rope tightly wrapped around his forearm upon his one arm and hand. He then severs it at the LCD's output. Using his Helmets Low-Light vision he looks for where the droid disappeared, takes aim and fires the LCD again, hoping the the Cable makes contact and sticks to the little Ball.
_________________________________________________________________________________
Spending a Force point to increase my chances of hitting him. Considering the oddness of the ranged attack I will let you come up with the modifiers. My unmodified ranged attack is: 6 ( 7 If he is still Point Blank range).
Perception ( if needed): 9
_________________________________________________________________________________
Feeling the LCD's rope fly out and contact nothing Trigger hopes for the best for the droid, and turns to begin his ascent from this dusty hell.
_______________________________________________________________________________
If I run into Nevlik I will help him up too.

Nevlik has a firm grip in the cable and isnt going anywhere down but is in for one heck of a ride.
((I can just picture a durose screaming his head off holding on for dear life as the LAAT/i dives through the battle field gripping the cable for all its worth <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->))

As Kryser and Marina finish pulling in the rest of the group the LAAT/i finally clears the dust cloud from the factory that had created it. Off in the distance they see the factory that they were in hit the ground and explode into a ball of flame.
Lt: Deuce: "We are to retreat to the forward command base where we will receive further instructions. AP make it there as quickly and safly as possible."
As the the soldier to some and the squad lead to others finishes what he is saying the man in the back starts to cough violently. After a few moments blood is sceen in his cough and he falls to the floor. The machine that was monitering him flat lines. **Roki feels a disturbence in the force**.

As Kryser sees the man die a powerful fear and dread rises in him. Unable to deal with the loss of a comrade, Kryser falls to his knees and covers himself and the dead man in whats looks to be force lightning. It sprouts from his eyes and hands into the man that has perished. Using all the rage and fear he can muster his body is engulfed in such a power the force is clearly seen. "DONT DIE ON ME, WE NEED YOU"

Roki shrugs his shoulders after no one answers his question and begins to aid the others in climbing into the transport. Roki stops when a dark feeling over whelms him, staring off into the battle field Roki tries some focus techniques to shake the dark feeling. Though he can not stop a single tear.

Torm can barely react to the life of then man next to him failing before Kryser throws himself at him, screaming at the man not to die. As he gets to his feet, he watches in suprise as dark waves begins to flow over the dead mans body from the other, and he can feel the ripples of the Dark Side surrounding Kryser.

Roki feels drawn to the workings that is going on in the back of the speeder. As he makes his way to see what the dark energy is all about he can see Master Sol lying dead upon the floor. As the tone of the medical tone of a flat line peirces his inner soul. Before Roki can act a jedi screams, "Don't die on me we need you!" and strange bolts shoot from him into the fallen jedi master. After a few moments the moniter beeps a sign of life and all jedi in the ship feel darkness coming from the jedi who is hanging over Master Sol.

Trigger looks over at his Rescue Mission targets. Seeing the "Lightning" he simply shrugs and mutters to himself.
"Jedi Business."
He then walks to the cockpit ladder and comms AP.
"Vod'ika, Whats our ETA, the new guys seem to be having a problem. And what have you done to our ship?"
He then looks back at the Jedi, Studying his new comrades. They looked weird. Some were Alien sure, But the humans, man was it weird to see so many different faces.

A sense of disturbance shoots through Torm as the seemingly dead man starts to show signs of life. He turns to Nevlik and leans closer.
"Some kind of healing power, I would assume. But I can sense the Dark Side strongly in this one. We should be cautious"

Exausted, Kryser flops onto his backside and sighs. "thank goodness, hes ok". "Does anyone need medical assistance"? kyrser asks the new members to the speeder. "Is anyone injuryed" he asks before anyone can answer his first question.

Unsure whether or not the Jedi was joking, Trigger shrugs again, still waiting for AP's answer. Looking over the Jedi as a group he notices them whispering amongst themselves, presumably about what just happened between the older, formerly dead, Jedi, and the younger one with the braid. Figuring he should answer his potential commanders anyway he looks directly at Kryser ( Being the one who asked the question).
"No, Sir, The Werdaâ€™denla are in no need of medical attention at this time."
Trigger dusts off his armor from any debris or carbon scoring he can reach. Realizing he lost his Heavy Repeater he grabs his Heavy pistol and warms it up., Making sure the ammo is good and it's ready to fire when he needs it.

As everyone stares at the jedi who just sent a dark pressence from him and revived the fallen jedi master the air speeder starts to send off an alarm warning of missle lock. With out hesitation the jedi scoop up the fallen master and leap from the speeder to the land platform that is only a few feet away. Trigger stumbles as the speeder banks left to avoid the missle at first and then is shoved out by Lt. Deuce.
Lt. Deuce (com): "No one left behind Trigger get them to safty i'll override APs cockpit and release them i'll behind you shortly!"
Trigger lands on his feet and turns to see his leiutenant dissappear into the air speeder and then AP's cockpit launch into the air. As Deuce is about to jump the missle hits sending him sprawling to the ground unconsisuos.
End of Chapter one.
