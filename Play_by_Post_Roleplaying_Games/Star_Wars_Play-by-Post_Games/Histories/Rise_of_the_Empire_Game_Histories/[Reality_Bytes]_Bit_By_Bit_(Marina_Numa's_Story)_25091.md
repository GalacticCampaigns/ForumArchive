# [Reality Bytes] Bit By Bit (Marina Numa's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-09-28 16:44:41)

Rain pours down from the Corellian sky, running down Marina Numa's jacket and pooling at her feet. She refuses to acknowledge the drops that obscure her vision and stares up into the dark eyes of her captain. The storm clouds cover the city in shades of grey and black, but a sudden flash of lightning illuminates the large Barabel frame before her. She's able to see a glimpse of sadness on his face before the world plunges once more into shadow. Rivulets of water form quickly and fall off the ship behind him to gather in puddles that will soon turn to little streams of their own. Marina maintains an appearance of dignity, despite the growing pond forming beneath her on the tarmac.
"**It's not that I don't *believe* you Marina, it's just… it's the crew.**"
Captain Vanar had employed Marina as ship's mechanic for the last several months. After a recent journey through hyperspace, the engines of the *Lucky Star* had burned out almost completely and she'd been unable to repair them - despite her best efforts. She lost several days sleep over the problem until she reached an inescapable conslusion: she found critical engine parts had actually been *sabotaged*. Not enough damage was done to endanger the ship or its occupants, just the right combination to make her look inept. The Barabel captain knew his crew well enough to publicly deny such claims, even while secretly agreeing with Marina. He ran a tight ship, but they were a rough lot and didn't take to newcomers easy. He kept Marina on just long enough to get the new parts installed. His crew simply didn't approve of having the young mechanic aboard and they wouldn't rest until they made her life miserable.
"**You understand. It's for the best.**" he nods with sincerity - and finality, " **Good luck out there, Jedi.**"
He says her title with the respect any true Barabel would give to a Jedi, no matter the circumstances. While she'd been able to conceal her training from the fledgling Empire so far, there were still some who had the experience to spot a Force-user when they saw one. More often than not it required living a nomadic lifestyle. Marina had grown to like her captain though, and parting with him was bittersweet. At least her secret was safe, and that was a comfort. These were tumultuous times for everyone, not just Jedi.
With a small nod he turns to ascend the loading ramp. The ship is aloft before the doors even seal shut, leaving Marina alone on the landing pad - rapidly becoming a small lake. The roar of the ship's engine is drown out by the rainfall as its running lights fade into the thick cloud cover, and she suddenly feels alone again. It's certainly not the first time. She can see the bustling evening streets and local shops of the city beyond the surrounding fences, the neon lights and crowded traffic offering plenty of opportunities to begin anew. Behind her is the small landing facility, little more than a shack with a droid attendant, through which she can leave the area. The city of Tyrena beckons her, and she prepares for the next chapter of her story.

The young woman’s heavy sigh is drowned out by the loud drone of the *Lucky Star*’s engines. Marina’s blue gaze watches disdainfully as she’s once again abandoned on a strange world. Even with all the animosity the crew held toward her, she had come to like the *Lucky Star*. She did, after all, have a roof over her head per say and decent meals. Captain Vanar was right, though. It was for the best. If she didn’t leave now, the next bit of sabotage would likely be more severe, possibly deadly. A part of Marina feels sorry for whoever the Barabel captain finds to replace her.
Pulling her jacket tighter against the rain she turns toward the little shack and the opening to the streets beyond. As she walks she takes stock of the situation. Everything she owns was on her person, a habit formed by the nomadic nature of her previous life as a Jedi. If she lived frugally, she could probably survive for a little while with the small amount of credits she had saved. First order of business, she decides upon reaching the droid attendant, was to find a place to dry off and get something warm in her stomach.

"**Greetings Miss! Welcome to Budget Port, Lower Tyrena's only Class B spaceport.**"
The droid begins extolling the virtues of the "three-star facility", though it's easy to understand why there's no one else here. The rust is almost as thick on the door frames as it is on the attendant. As it drones on in a female voice, Marina can see the set of local maps cycling on the wall display. A promotional clip begins to run in the lower right corner.
"**…the variety offered in the vending machines is, oh - I see you're interested *Big Mama Byn's Hostel*.**" the droid says, as if synchronized to the advertisement. "**A very reasonable place if you're looking to stay the night. A games room and large selection of bedding styles. Conveniently located across the street, half a block down.**" Her voice lowers slightly, like the pre-recorded sequence has finished and Marina is now listening to the droid's genuine words. "**Might I recommend, though, something a little more…private? *The Cleft* offers affordable accommodations for short-term or long-term stay and has its own diner on the first floor. It's just a few streets over,**" she points to the wall map, indicating a location three blocks away, "**And they won't overcharge you. The single rooms are actually quite spacious and manager Norel is most kind. I used to work there in fact, but that was years ago.**"
The lights dim for a moment, and the droid's voice resumes is pre-recorded tone once more. "**Ah, what about this weather? Not to worry though, all Budget Ports have a backup generator in the event of grid failure. Shall I have your bags brought up to the guest room then?**" A heavily modified astromech, clearly in need of a parts overhaul, sputters and rolls out from behind the counter expectantly.

Upon entering the small shack, the young mechanic is instantly assailed by the promotional propaganda programmed into the unfortunate attendant droid. A pool of water begins to form at her feet and unconsciously she runs her fingers through her black hair plastered to her head.
Marina half listens to the droid's pronouncements as she heads over to the map inspecting it before pulling out the connector to her bracer computer, plugging it into the map display and downloading the maps it was so conveniently displaying. As the droid vocalizes the ad for the hostel and then suggests another place Marina stores it away, deciding to visit the hostel first since it was closest and then head over to the suggested establishment. Wouldn't hurt to compare the facilities. After all, the Force only knew how long she would be here.
Finishing up she absently waves away the overeager astromech, feeling sorry for its disrepaired state. "**That won't be necessary; there aren't any.**” Pulling on the disconnected cord, she winds it back into it’s designated holder. With a glance at the attendant droid she gives it a nod. “**Thanks for the information,**" she adds and then takes a look out the exit onto the street outside. With a sigh she pulls the collar of her jacket up in anticipation of the ensuing downpour of rain.
It’s with some haste that the young woman makes her way across the street to her first destination, taking a good look at the surroundings and varied array of neon signs.

The rain continues to fall steadily, and what few can be seen traveling the streets are as soaked as Marina is. This section of Tyrena looks to have become a haven for lower-income citizens. Whether it was captain Vanar's attempt at giving the young Jedi a good place to lay low or the crew's final joke she can't quite tell. It's just a short sprint across the street though - carefully avoiding both the traffic and the puddles - and she is once again safe from the elements. Exiting the building is an ensign and two Imperial soldiers whose attention seems fixed on some important task which the current weather appears to have hampered.
Before the trio are out of earshot, Marina catches the officer on his comlink addressing a superior: "**No sir, it wasn't another excuse. The garrison reports they are three hours behind schedule and won't arrive until later in the afternoon. Yes sir, I agree, but what can be done?**"
Marina looks around and finds herself in little more than a small corridor, the dull brown walls are bare and poorly patched over in many spots. The lighting is dim but she can see a rather ragged looking Vurk standing by the stairwell . If the lanyard hanging crookedly about her neck is any indication, she's the night attendant. This does not appear to be a station she enjoys in the least and gives the immediate impression that if you are not here for shift-change, you are not worth her attention. The young Jedi is conspicuous both in her appearance and her presence at such a late hour though, and earns a cold greeting:
"**And what do *you* want?**"

Glad to be out of the rain, the young Jedi’s mood drops when she spots the officer and his lackeys exiting the establishment. It was strange being on a Core World to begin with, but now she really had to watch out for the local Imperial presence, which - if what she overheard was right - was about to be reinforced. Hopefully if she stayed out of trouble they would remain oblivious to her presence. Marina almost snorted with humor at the thought. *Stay out of trouble? That would be something.* Walking down the hallway, she leaves puddles of water with every step. When the Vurk addresses her she stops, giving the small puddles a chance to coalesce into one larger where she happens to be standing.
Marina pretends to ignore the Vurk’s sour mood and resists the urge to shake of more of the water. “**Could you tell me if this establishment has any vacancies?**”

"**I suppose I *could*, it's the only reason I'm here after all.**"
The attendent flips open a small datapad and spends several long moments typing.
"**I've a bunk on the third-floor, and the -**" she chuckles, "**- *rooftop suite* is vacant. It's thirty credits a night, paid in advance or you'll have to find somewhere else. For more long-term arrangements you can talk to the staff tomorrow. I don't do *that*.**" She says the last sentence with a clear disdain for the day shift and looks at Marina expectantly. Looking closer, she can read the name on the lanyard: *Christina*.

### **Alicia** (2011-10-03 17:41:12)

Marina hid a wince as the 30 credit price tag was put forth, but her curiosity about what the area dubbed the rooftop suite entailed overruled her initial reaction. "**What's the rooftop suite?**" she asks bluntly, there was no reason to bet around the bush with this woman who obviously wanted to get rid of her.

---

## Re: Bit By Bit (Marina Numa's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-03 23:08:35)

The Vurk stifles another chuckle and presses a key on her datapad. A small remote hovers its way down the stairs and stops about a meter in front of Marina. It watches her for a few moments, looking her over with its single electronic eye. It glides back over to the attendant and waits for instructions, curiousity satisfied.
"**This one wants to see the roof, and don't take forever. We've still got rounds to do. She hasn't paid yet, so if she sticks around make sure you get the credits, got it?**"
A chirp of Binary and the remote sways back to Marina and begins to float its way slowly up the staircase, clearly intending for her to follow. It stops occasionally to let her catch up, and after eight long flights of stairs the pair reach the final landing. The lights continue to flicker in and out - something as likely due to weather as to poor wiring. The building can't be that far from earning a *condemned* status. The droid hovers over to a ladder resting on the wall where there's a wooden hatch in the ceiling above. If the damp floor is any indication, it leads out onto the roof.
Reading her cue, Marina ascends the ladder and climbs through the hatch. Fully expecting to be soaked again, she's pleasantly surprised to find a small, relatively dry room. The light from below spills in and she takes a moment to let her eyes roam. It's no more than four meters square, but there's some bedding and her own rooftop access. The access door must have required a key card at one point but has clearly been damaged and would likely just push wide open. The opposite wall has a large window with what is probably a great view of Lower Tyrena when visibility isn't so poor. A small lamp in one corner of the room seems operable and as if reading her mind, the droid hovers over and bumps the switch. The illumination proves more than adequate to see the rest of the "suite". There's a shelf running all around the upper half, perfect for storing a reasonable amount of gear. The walls rise at gradual angles, coming together in a bubble-canopy skylight about two meters across through which Marina can see the lightning flashing across the sky amidst the streaks of rainwater snaking down and away. The whole room has the effect of being at the top of some sort of old steeple - a conclusion not far from the truth.
The droid hovers patiently, waiting for Marina's reaction. It extends a compact credit reader and lets loose a series of inquisitive beeps. Above its eye is a tarnished plate bearing a designation with a name scrawled underneath: **01** - *Bit*.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Binary translations: <*Yes Master Tenna.*> and <*Will Green Lady stay?*> respectively.
I hope that describes things well. Basically it's a small roof access converted into some semblance of a room.

Marina watches the droid with her own sense of curiosity and follows its progress as it hovers in front of the night attendant. Getting its instructions, Marina dutifully follows the little remote up the flights of stairs, but by the time she reaches the top she discovers the downside to living almost exclusively on a starship for extended periods.
After being pleasantly surprised not to find herself flooded by a rush of water from the rooftop access, the young Jedi hoists the hatch to the side letting it fall to rest where it may on its hinges and climbs the rest of the way into the rooftop suite.
It was small all things considered, but she didn’t need all that much room. Moving absently about she gives the door to the rooftop a half-hearted shove. The room itself needed some work, and she wondered how viable a living space it would be should it get cold. There was nothing else Marina disdained more. At least it was dry and it had that going for it. If she could get the door fixed she'd have a way to come and go virtually undetected. Heading back to the hatch, she checked to see what sort of lock it had.
Overall, she liked the place, and with some work it had great potential if she was going to stay for a long period. Especially if she could work out some deal with the establishment for long term residency. The late hour and the desire to remain out of the rain long enough to dry off overcame her initial desire to head onto the next establishment. After all that could be done in the morning when a hot meal would be most welcome.
Pulling out her credit chip, she swiped it in Bit’s credit reader and couldn’t help get a small sinking feeling as she realized she was now 30 credits less of her already sparse funds.
"By the way, where's the refresher?"

## Re: Bit By Bit (Marina Numa's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-04 14:25:23)

After beeping confirmation of her credit receipt, Bit listens attentively to her question. It takes a few moments to process her question, then chirps and floats back down into the hallway. Marina follows down the hall and spots the refresher located just across from the top of the stairs. The little droid enters through a smaller hatch in the wall, and then emerges with a partner. The partner is of a similar make and model but equipped with an assortment of cleaning equipment on tiny appendages. The panel on it reads: **02**. Carefully inscribed below that is the name "*Bot*".
A string of beeps and whistles ensue between the two and Bit finally nods to Marina that she's welcome to enter. The two droids glide off down the stairwell as the main lights flicker once more.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Rough Binary translation (because they were talking to each other the transmissions were much faster and Marina couldn't catch it all):
**Bot**: <*Two Droid has…duties…*>
**Bit**: <*Green Lady…customer…paid…respect customers…*>
**Bot**: <*…organic functions…duties…*>

### **Alicia** (2011-10-04 16:09:41)

The young Jedi follows along the best she can to the two little remote’s conversation but only manages to catch snippets of the fast paced language. With a small frown she watches as the two hover away and she turns her attention to the door to the refresher.
Like the rest of the building, it had seen better days and was small. Taking a look into the lone shower stall, Marina saw the tiles were beginning to fall off the walls exposing the drywall beneath. It became questionable whether the water would even be hot. After giving the better maintained toilets out of two an experimental flush she headed over to the single sink turning the hot water faucet on. After a long groan, the water spat out went from a murky brown color to an almost clear and, surprisingly yet, began to steam slightly after a few more moments. Rinsing her hands under the water, she turned it off and vacated the now relatively fully explored refresher.
It would do.
Beginning to feel a bit chilled she heads back to her “suite”, locking the hatch behind her and finding it completely in adequate for the long term. Not to mention a way to lock it from the outside, while she’d be able to carry all her possessions with her, why let the curious come and go as they pleased.
After quickly gauging the size of the bed, Marina began the process of moving it so one of the legs rested in the middle of the hatch into the small room. Maybe she was being paranoid, but why not be cautious? With that done, she started to take off her wet clothes, stripping down to her damp tank-top and underwear. Wrapping the questionable blanket around her shoulders to warm up she hung up the wet garments the best she could from the shelves; the water still dripping puddles onto the floor. Tossing her blaster onto the bed, she pulled out some of her remaining rations. Sitting on the bed, she checked the weapon over as she munched on the bland sustenance. It would be so nice to actually get a hot breakfast.
Satisfied at the state of her weapon she tucked it under the pillow near here and laid down, going into a meditative state rather than sleep with her hand near the grip of her blaster and still wrapped up tightly in the blanket.

## Re: Bit By Bit (Marina Numa's Story)

### **Alicia** (2011-10-06 16:45:26)

Slipping into the trance-like sleep was easy for the young Jedi after so many years of practice and at first she lets her mind wander.
*The day was cold and wet. The rainy season was ending and the spring promised a prolific bloom from the nutrients the mountain fed swollen rivers had deposited in the midst of the lower valleys and farmland. She had come here at the start of the fall season her belly already beginning to swell, and had helped in the gathering of the community’s harvest before the rains set in making all work outside nearly impossible. Soon the farmland below would drain and that would be the Cloudspinner’s queue to begin the planting. A big party was already being planned and the whole community was expected to come up from the stone and wooden buildings of the village and help in the sowing. It was such a simple life here.
The people of Iruji needed little in the way of technology but what they did have was simple and well maintained. These people had lived the same way for generations since their colony was founded a generation before the Mandalorian Wars. Their blood had mixed with families of Force users, Jedi and redeemed Sith, who had found refuge and made their homes here away from the galaxy's gaze. As a result the community shared in Force sensitive ancestry, most of them tracing their ancestry to the Cloudspinner and Tenson families. Jaya Cloudspinner, who claimed to be her grandmother, had called her here when the young Jedi had felt at a loss. At some point she had called out for help through the Force and the elder had answered it.
The young woman rests in a padded, wooden reclining chair, admiring the array of rainbows the misty morning cast about the valley the Cloudspinner estate rested by. Nested into the mountain, the Cloudspinner family had carved out the various rooms into the stone with a small wooden porch jutting out of the lowermost level, well away from the high flood water. In her hand she twirls the small coral pearl sensing the life force within it connected to the sleeping child within the house. Jaya had given Marina the small gem after her near deadly childbirth, claiming it would radiate the little girl's life force till the day she died. It had been then Marina had noticed the five pearls around the older woman's neck, two of which had turned black. The young Jedi wondered if one of those had been created when her father was born. There was no such pearl for her, she knew. If there was, it had been lost or stolen before Marina even had the memory of its significance.
Now the bright coral pearl only served to remind her of the choice she had to make. One that would not be easy. The young Jedi could stay, give up her position in the Jedi Order and everything she had been taught to believe in. She wouldn’t be the first Jedi to find refuge on Iruji, after all. She could stay here and raise her child in the peace the planet had to offer. Nadia was the secret she would have to keep for the rest of her life; her hope of life outside the Order.
At first Marina had thought to take the young child to the temple to be raised as she had, but the thought was quickly dismissed upon Nadia’s birth when Marina herself had almost died. Marina shivered slightly as the vision she’d had at the brink of life and death filtered into her thoughts: betrayal, fire and death. She’d had the sense that if she were to take Nadia to the temple, her daughter would die. A Jedi didn’t ignore such impressions from the Force lightly.
And so, Marina had overextended her stay longer than she should have; ignoring her master’s summons for as long as she could. Spending every possible moment with the child she doubted she would ever see again. Soon, though, Marina would have to let go, but that didn’t mean she would have to forget.*
Waking from the trance, Marina rubs her eyes with the back of her hand. Since the end of the war, the young woman’s thoughts had returned continually to Iruji. Maybe one day, she can find safe passage back there, and she could fulfill her promise to return for her daughter. Till then she knows it wouldn’t serve to dwell on such thoughts. Casting them aside, Marina gets up from the bed. She was glad to see it had stopped raining during the night and the sun was just beginning to peak around the nearby buildings. Her view was almost interrupted from this height.
Checking on her clothes, she's pleased to discover the warmth of the room had pretty much dried the damp clothes. It doesn't take long for her to dress fully and put on her fully laden utility belt and the hip holster into which she puts her blaster pistol. Her jacket she leaves strewn over the end of the bed. Moving toward the roof door she gives it a push in attempt to get open and inspect the rooftop in the morning light.

The heavy door slides under the force of Marina's Jedi muscle and she steps through the exit. Before her lies the rooftop of *Big Mama Byn's Hostel*: the tops of ventilation units, debris blown by updrafts from the street level and standing pools of water in more than one place. She's over eight floors up, which puts her higher than most of her immediate neighborhood. *The Cleft* can be seen clearly, the elegant sign and well-kept appearance a stark contrast to her current abode. It very well may have been a more comfortable choice for a stormy evening's rest. A flash of white and black catches her eye from one of the bay windows near the top of the other building though, and she recognizes it instantly: the armor of an Imperial Stormtrooper. How well could she have slept knowing they were around? The sunlight feels warm and comforting, and Marina is content to spend just a few moments basking in its rays, eyes closed and hands outstretched. The chatter of a city waking up washes over her and she feels a little less alone than when she arrived only hours ago.
Suddenly, she hears a faint noise coming from the other end of the roof. She listens intently and after a couple seconds is able to identify the sound as some sort of small machinery or collection of mechanical parts. The sound resembles gears grinding on each other, but it's mixed with something like Binary that Marina can't understand. It can't be too large since it's completely hidden from sight by one of the air exchange vents. If it is mechanical in nature, it's likely damaged. The noise continues in a steady, but weak, pattern.

Taking in the early morning light of Corellia’s sun, Marina walks the perimeter of the rooftop looking over the edge at the surrounding buildings to see how viable of an escape route they might be in the future – a Jedi could jump pretty far – and also looks for any fire escapes or other built in ways down to the streets below.
Gazing out toward the better managed building of her second stop she spots the tall tale signs of Stromtroopers moving about. Had she stayed there, she would have probably run across them by now. The idea to hide under their nose was going to be somewhat nerve wracking it seemed.
Sidestepping a standing puddle of water – an indicator of possible leaks in the ceiling below – she clears her mind in the heat of the early morning sun. It had been awhile since she’d stood planetside and just admired the sunrise. It reminded her of her days on the out of the way world her master Firith Ven had trained her those first couple years of her apprenticeship. Standing up at the top of the cliffs and overall admiring the view.
Marina’s thoughts are interrupted suddenly by the mechanical buzzing. On immediate alert she moves toward the sound with careful steps, ready to act if needed. The indistinguishable binary suggests to her it might be a droid, one that didn’t sound like it was in such great shape. What a surprise given where she is.

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-10 17:40:23)

As she makes her rounds of the roof, Marina makes note of several possible escape routes. There's enough of a ledge at each story that with a little luck she could probably manage scaling the wall of her current dwelling without too much hassle. The leap to nearby buildings poses a more difficult challenge - the building behind the hostel (viewed with her back to the spaceport she came from) is about two stories higher, but the other two directions drop by several meters each. She judges the alleys to be about 4.5m across, and could probably make the jump okay, but sticking the landing might be tricky. The taller building doesn't have much in the way of handholds, but in a pinch she could probably shatter one of the windows and vault through. With luck, she might be able to jump across and catch something to hold onto though.
A small flash suddenly catches her eye. It's coming from a balcony at least halfway across the city, and it's one of the taller spires on the skyline. It looks as though the morning sun could be reflecting off a lens or visor, and for some reason she senses trouble. The feeling of being watched comes over her, but her concerns are lost when she hears the closer noise, and begins to approach the vicinity cautiously. Marina reaches out and, using the Force, is able to detect little in the way of immediate danger. She can picture a small but very damaged droid laying on the rooftop just beyond one of the smaller air exchange vents.
The image is proved correct when, rounding the corner, she's able to see the scene clearly. A small drone lies before her, heavily damaged and very close to total system failure. The chassis has been split wide open and many of the internal components have been burned or fused together. The electronic eye swivels slowly to focus on the Jedi.
<*…TARGET…ACQUIRED…*>
Marina barely has time to interpret the broken Binary before the droid explodes in a shower of sparks. She is unharmed, but the machine now lies motionless and silent. Whatever secrets may have been gleaned from within are lost. All that remains is a damaged chassis.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, let's tackle the escape route stuff:
Climb DC10 to climb down/up the hostel wall - plenty of window ledges and such.
Climb DC20 to climb down/up the surface of the taller building.
Jump DC13 to jump across any of the alleys, with a drop of 7m (2d6 falling damage, p. 255, Core) - Athletics DC25 to land without taking damage.
Athletics DCInsane to jump to street level, but let's go with 3m/floor (which is probably about right). The hostel is eight stories tall, so that's 24m. You do the math.
Feel free to describe the chassis as you like, according to the beginnings of BeeDee. It will need to be repaired to full hp, and that will represent repairing all the internal stuff, but the processor is slag. **Creation** Destiny grants a 24-hour +1 bonus to all skill checks and ability checks, and working on BeeDee counts for that. Of course, given the droid's last words, Marina might be cautious. Have fun! Let me know if you have questions.

The young Jedi’s full attention turns to focus on the small unknown droid which might be a more immediate threat, and for the moment, she forgets about the apprehension she felt upon spotting the reflecting lens. As it sputters and nearly explodes in her face, she puzzles over the small bits of binary. *Target acquired? What the heck does that mean?*
Bending over the decimated droid, Marina glances over its remains. It looked remarkably like a Marksman droid, one she had used as a child in her studies of lightsaber combat. *Maybe its some sort of security version of the other remotes hovering around this place?* Picking it up, she reaches out with the Force to see if she can pick up any residual memories form it.
Before heading in to further examine the little remote, she takes a look around the area, looking for clues as to where the droid came from and how it might have been damages. Heading back toward the entrance she takes a look over toward the balcony where in the early morning light she had seen the light reflect off a lense.

Marina's instincts are observations are proved correct, the droid is indeed based on the Marksman droids she's so familiar with. She spends a few minutes searching for any information to the droid's origins or masters by delving into the particular aspects of the Force that deal with machines. Sentience is a fickle thing though, and the only result is a sense of sinister intent and some sort of connection to the balcony across Tyrena - no specific memories or data is revealed. She gives a cursory study of the burn patterns and the immediate surroundings and concludes with a fair level of confidence this little hovering mystery was brought down by nothing more than the abnormal build-up of electric energy in the atmosphere the night before. The charred rooftop further supports the idea of a lightning strike passing through the chassis and splitting it open, frying its insides.
Marina stands and makes her way back to her room. The door is still laying open, but she gives a final look before heading in. On the street below she can see various modes of transportation in a hurry to start the day. A lone droid makes his way into the spaceport where Marina herself had arrived and feels a small disturbance in the Force - not clearly positive or negative in nature, but the sense of great potential. Her eyes find their way once more to the distant balcony where, despite seeing nothing of note, she does get a clear mental impression: evil, primitive, savage and powerful.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Think I covered it all okay. The droid doesn't have a WilDef to use for the Technometry usage, it's basically just a hunk of damaged parts. Once repaired though, you'll have better luck with it, with or without a new processor. With one, you can then activate the droid and have an even greater chance of succes. Let me know if you have questions. Wave to Surge! ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

As the Force filled her with impressions she saught about the droid, Marina finds her self equally concerned and curious about the droid’s origins. Was someone watching her? Did they know who she was? Suddenly her rooftop sanctuary didn’t feel so safe and she couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. Putting the small droid in the pocket of her jacket she makes her way inside. The feeling distracted her as she attempted to pull the door and losing her grip she fell backward. Only after stopping and taking a calming breath was she able to finally get the door closed. The feeling continued to envelop her even as she closed the door to the rooftop room.
Deciding a change of scenery might do her some good, and some food besides she shifts her makeshift barrier out of the way and opens the hatch. With a final glance around she makes sure she hadn’t forgotten anything and heads down to the first floor and out to the street. Maybe staying here wasn’t going to be such a good idea.

The street is busy with morning commuters and growing foot traffic and the city's skyline still casts long shadows. Marina is grateful for the cover of the buildings, she feels far less exposed than she did up on the roof. Certainly no one further than a block or two away would be able to keep a clear line of sight on her from any balcony.
The young Jedi's mind set at ease, she next addresses her growling stomach. It seemed like days since she'd had a decent meal - and even then *decent* was only an approximation of the food aboard the *Lucky Star*. Many of the shops are still closed, or in various stages of opening, and Marina finds herself standing in front of *The Cleft* - the upscale hotel first mentioned by the attendant droid during her arrival on Tyrena. The first-floor diner is open and serving all manner of hot and cold breakfast.
Marina enters through the double doors, passing a handful of valet droids in pristine condition - a great contrast to her dwelling only three blocks away. Inside, the modern diner is filling up with patrons enjoying their complimentary morning meals. The center of the large room is cut by a wide stairwell rising to a pair of turbolifts. The kitchen seems located behind the stairwell, with booths and tables setup on either side all the way to the walls. The front windows look out onto the street and that, too, looks neater than the one Marina had stepped out onto only a short time ago. A Jedi would never walk into a trap, and she is no different - Marina remembers the Imperial troops she saw through one of the upper windows. Even now she can sense the presence of the Empire but it's calm and, at the moment, she feels no immediate danger to her person. At least not enough to skip a warm meal. She finds a table close to the door (only a fool would distance herself from an exit, even if assured of safety) and is approached by one of the droid waitresses:
"**G'Mornin' hun, ya like a menu?**"

The menu is all you, order what you like, the prices are reasonable (p.141, Core as reference).

Feeling better now at street level, with the eyes of her watcher obscured by the various buildings around her, Marina takes pace with the rest of the early morning pedestrians. Taking in the sights of the dwellings and businesses around her, she lets her feet guide her to her next destination - breakfast. After making sure to keep a broken line of sight to her watcher’s perch, she finds herself outside the establishment she once thought of boarding in, though it was still a possibility as long as she kept her head down. After all, her pursuer might think it an idiotic move to live in a building full of Stormtroopers. As she takes her seat at her chosen table she gives her droid waitress a nod. "**Yes please and a cup of caf**." With the menu in hand she takes a look at it, while her hunger wanted her to splurge on a big meal she decided on something more modest and yet filling.
With her order of the flat cakes and eggs given to her waitress she pulls out the small droid from her jacket pocket. The chassis had been bulging out her pocket and was deceivingly heavy for it's size. Turning it in her hands she assessed the full extent of the damage, pulling at wires and plating where needed, and getting a sense of the droid's capabilities or whether is it had a locator on it. The last thing she wanted was her location to be broadcasted. When she spots it she disables any weapons the little droid has, not wanting it to start firing on her if it was inadvertently activated. Not that she believed the droids processor was worth much at present.

Marina takes her time eating her meal and examining the damaged drone. Opening it's front panel reveals what she had already suspected: the processor was, indeed, little more than slag. The Jedi technician works skillfully around the damaged components and is able to salvage nearly all the internal systems while retrieving the melted metal brain. She glances up as a pair of droids come in. Her table is nearest the door and it's not hard to get a good look without being conspicuous. One wears an old captain's cap, but the other is the one she saw earlier from the roof. A ripple of the Force surrounds him and, though it isn't quite clear exactly, Marina can sense something special about him - or at least her connection to him. He reeks of death and the Dark Side, that much is certain, but there's a sense of hope too. The latter seems almost to overwhelm the former - but what it means she can't determine. They take their seats in a booth across the room.
Turning once more to her food - and project - she continues to work steadily at both.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

a) Breakfast costs $10 - adjust your sheet accordingly.
b) BD has been restored 3hp, but since it doesn't have a working processor you need one before you can activate it.
c) How would a Jedi react to a droid that has been around since the end of the Clone Wars and has killed all manner of living beings, Jedi included? Especially one that may very well be an ally in the near future? Would the Force be strong? The Dark Side? Just another mystery we'll have to unravel together...

The young Jedi pauses in her work as she takes notice of the two droids enter the diner. This fact alone would not have been unusual if they hadn’t proceeded to find a booth on the other side of the diner and taken the seats as if they were patrons. Ever more curious was the impressions she receive via the Force of the one. At first glance it looked to her to be a modified Separatist Commando droid, but it was obviously more than that to be out here and still functioning on its own. The aura of the Dark Side surrounding it only served to make her more wary, though the sense of hope confused her. From what Marina could tell, the droid was a killer and probably took satisfaction from it. She couldn’t discern what the Force was trying to tell her and it troubled her.
Realizing she was staring Marina goes back to the flat cakes the mechanical waitress had brought to her, the hot food settling nicely in her stomach. Turning the fried processor around in her other hand she did a final examination of it before putting in her pouch. Maybe she could repair it enough to access its memory files later.
Marina finishes off her breakfast and as the waitress refills her cup of caf, she asks, “**Who would I speak to about boarding?**”

"**Oh, you'd wanna speak with one of the gals upstairs about that, miss. Manager Norel don't like us doing that down here.**"
The waitress points to the top of the stairs where, just to the side of the turbolifts, is a large window in the wall. On closer inspection it appears that this serves as the front desk for the hotel portion of *The Cleft* and the droid receptionist within is working busily.
"**Save ya meal slip and they'll take off the price of a night's stay though.**"
She gives Marina a wink and continues on to the other tables. The pair of droids from earlier haven't moved and seem to be having some serious conversation, but she can't make out the exact content without being too obvious.

Marina gives the waitress a nod of thanks as her attention moves to the top of the steps. It was worth looking into, even with all the stormtroopers around. Finishing off the cup of caf, she puts the little remote back into her pocket and heads up the stairs. Her gaze travels back to the two unusual droids, apparently still deep in their own conversation. With a shake of her head she mounts the first step and makes her way up, stopping as she reaches the reception window.
After catching the busy droid’s attention, she inquires “**Excuse me, could you give me some information about your lodgings? I’m looking for extended lodgings.**” After a pause to let the droid process the request she adds, “**I’m also wondering who I might speak to about employment?**”

## Re: Bit By Bit (Marina Numa's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-18 11:21:48)

The receptionist continues about her business - which seems to involve a great deal of manual communications routing - but acknowledges Marina with a nod. An image appears superimposed on the window:<div style="text-align: center;">
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">*Welcome to The Cleft!*</span>**
*Single: 40c/day, 250c/week
Double: 75c/day, 500c/week
All rates include one complimentary meal in the diner each day.
Check-out is at noon.
**Enjoy your stay!***
</div>

After waiting a few moments for Marina to read through the rates, she then displays another image. It seems less formal and is likely more of an internal memo than an official advertisement:
**To:** All Staff
*We still haven't been able to get to the bottom of what's wrong with the com-lines, but the weather last night didn't help I'm sure. Please offer our profuse apologies to our patrons and keep up the good work. With any luck we'll be able to sort this all out by this afternoon.*
-***Norel Jax, General Manager***
The receptionist must have noticed the young Jedi tech's work in the diner because she points to Marina's pocket and then motions to the array of open com-lines splayed out on the counter. She pauses to speak for the first time: "**You can see the rates are quite reasonable, and we'll deduct the cost of your breakfast from the first night's total. I'm sure Manager Norel would be willing to discuss some measure of employment, however, if you're any good with these sorts of things…**" The droid waves her spindly arm across the mess of wires and novice splicing work before her.

With an incline of her own head in acknowledgment, Marina glances over the pricing for the Cleft's residences. Considering the state of the facilities, the prices seemed reasonable, but she was still uncomfortable about the Imperial presence. More interested in finding work, the young woman takes a look at the mess of wires and the droid's vain attempt to solve the problem.
"**I'd be glad to take a look, especially if you'll put in a good word for me to Norel. What seems to be wrong with them. What isn't the com-lines doing?**" Peering through the window Marina tries to determine the problem, though she knows that to figure it out she'd have to get in the thick of the mess, which meant getting on the other side of the window. "**If you'd let me in I could give you my expert opinion.**"

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-18 23:43:51)

The receptionist listens to Marina carefully, knowing that her area is off-limits to those without prior appointments.
"**Very well, but only for a look and only for a moment. You're not authorized to be back here at all but if it means getting things back in order I'm sure Manager Norel won't mind.**"
The wall slides open to reveal a cleverly hidden door to the reception area right beside the window itself. Within sits the droid - affixed to the floor - amidst a tangle of wires and open circuitry. Marina can tell just from glancing around it would take a little while to repair, no matter what the issue was. If replacement parts were required or other areas of the network needed fixing as well it would probably take longer.
"**The storm last night must have had something to do with it. Comms seem to go in and out of service at random and some areas of the building don't have service at all.**"

I need a **Perception** roll against a DC25 (no taking 10/20) to assess the damages from what Marina can see, and a **Persuasion** roll if you want to try and work on it now.

Feel free to make up whatever computer terms you need to.

Stepping into room, Marina takes a quick look around, paying close attention to the wires spread about. The receptionist obviously hadn't been programmed to fix the network, as the young mechanic could see from the novice job of splicing it was doing in the confines of the alcove.
"**Looks like you've gotten yourself into a bit of a tangle here,**" Marina casually observes, stepping over a mess of wires to reach the droid and to take a closer look at a nearby exposed circuit panel. "**If you'd let me test some of the wires, I might be able to get a better understanding of what's going on.**" With the unspoken query, one of the young Jedi's eyebrows shoots up in question of permission.

"**I…I don't know. Will it take long? I really shouldn't have let you back here…**"
The receptionist's fears are interrupted as a chirp from the panel on the desk indicates an incoming call. She turns to answer it and Marina is left to survey the wiry debacle on her own - at least for the moment. It's not a pretty sight. She can't be sure exactly what the issue is without looking further down the lines, but there appears to be some burn damage in the power routers. Last night's electrical storm could be the culprit, but usually things like this would be grounded. There's some scoring on the multi-line inverters as well, but the major problem is the load on the com-line distributor junction needs re-calibration. All in all it looks like a good four or five hour's work.
The droid motions for Marina not to touch anything and then points to the door.

Taking the hint, Marina exits the small room letting the droid finish whatever communique it was receiving before broaching the topic of the malfunctioning communications grid once again. While she had a good idea what was wrong with it, to get a better picture she would have to handle the lines. Unfortunately the receptionist wasn't going to let her near them. *Time to talk to the manager*, she supposes.

A tall, well-dressed Human leaves the lift and heads toward the counter, his face studying a datapad with intensity reserved for those in authority with big problems. His attire is crisp and clean - formal and superior in appearance but somehow with a sense of kindness and gentleness in his gait. His dark eyes look troubled and distracted as he approaches the window...
"**Hey KT, you haven't - oh, I'm sorry miss. Please, go ahead.**"
He motions for Marina to finish her business, but the droid explains:
"**Greetings Manager Norel! As a matter of fact, I was about to send this young lady to your office. She had inquired about future employment and extended lodging, and has indicated a willingness to help solve our current technical dilemma.**"
The manager then studies Marina for a moment, and then nods slowly:

Lacing her fingers in front of her, she lets the words sit for a moment as she draws breath. “**I wouldn’t be surprised if this wasn’t the first time you’ve had issues. The distributor junction itself is overloaded and needs a major recalibration to get it working correctly.**  “

Norel Jax was no fool. Marina stood before him with a quiet confidence that many twice her age had failed to perfect. Nothing she could ever say would cause him to doubt the abilities of his own technicians, but her knowledge on the subject was clear. With a nod of deference and a widening grin he decides to take a risk:
"**Consider the opportunity granted, miss…?**"
He motions for Marina to follow and the two enter the closest turbolift. The journey to his office on the top floor is full of conversation, but it's mostly technical in nature. Norel shares the datapad he had been reading from - the latest reports from the work crews. Marina has no problem keeping up and he is genuinely impressed both by her grasp of the situation and her comments regarding possible solutions. They enter his office where he sits at his desk and begins to pull up some data on the main screen. Marina takes her seat across from him. The view outside is breath-taking and while she knew *The Cleft* was more upscale than her previous night's accommodations, the contrast was now made all the more obvious.
"**I'm bringing up all the files you'll need to get started right away. The crew is scattered throughout the building but you're welcome to start wherever you think it best - I'll make sure to let them know you're cleared. There we go…**" he ejects a small data card and hands it to Marina. "**All that's left is the matter of payment. It's worth 1,000 credits to me to get this fixed, and if you manage it before noon there'll be a two-hundred credit bonus. We can talk long-term arrangements afterwards. Sound good?**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

So unless you have any other plans, go ahead and make you post and then include three rolls: **Perception**, **Mechanics**, and **Use Computer**. If you can make a DC80 between them you finish the job by noon. You can use 1 FP if it helps. Working with the others does not grant the *aid another* bonus (not yet anyway). Have as much fun as you like with part names and where you go in the hotel (roof, basement, etc.) and consider yourself to have mostly free reign of the building. The Imperial presence is obvious - Stormtroopers and officers roam the halls on whatever tasks they've got, but they won't interfere with Marina's work.

### **Alicia** (2011-10-21 23:55:40)

“**Marina,**” the young woman offers with a widening, pleased smile and a slight bow. She makes a conscious effort not to do a full Jedi bow of greeting.“**Marina Cloudspinner,**” she adds, trying out the use of father’s last name. As she follows the now talkative, courteous manager up the turbolift to his office, she didn’t even want to think about what list her own self appointed surname of Numa would turn up on.
As they proceed up to the office, she listens attentively to what the Cleft’s own technicians had discovered was wrong and verifying her own opinions on the matter with a quick scan of the datapad he proffers. Satisfied she was on the right track with her own first impressions of the damage she makes a mental plan of action.
Stepping into his office and after admiring the magnificent view of the cityscape outside Norel’s office window, she takes her seat and continues her scan of the data in his office. She sets the report onto his desk when he hands over the datacard, inserting it into the port of her bracer computer and quickly checks its contents. There wasn’t much new information, she notices, but it was good to have a copy of everything she had seen for future reference. Satisfied she has everything she needs, she gives Norel a nod of thanks.
“**Yes, thank you for this opportunity,**” she says earnestly. The payment for the work was more than agreeable to the young woman, more than tripling her current funds. It was a relief that for the immediate future she wasn’t going to be broke and would probably have the spare money to see about the replacement processor and parts to fix the droid. Combined with the prospect of more work thrilled her. If only there wasn’t an Imperial presence in the building things would probably be perfect. Though as she sat there, looking over the data, an idea of bugging their levels sprang to mind. Probably wouldn’t be too much of an ordeal to tap her comm frequency into the comm relays. It would be worth the risk if she has the opportunity she decides.
Ready to begin she takes her leave and heads first to the roof to access the damage there. Being already on the top floor it was the logical place to begin. The dish antenna was in the state she expected having been hit by the lightning from the night before. What she should have suspected was the two technicians already hard at work on replacing the damaged power converters and capacitors. As she steps back into the lift, she hopes they do a better job of grounding the unit this time.
Making her way down she stops at the uppermost level of what’s been assigned to the Imperials. Under the pretense of checking the comm lines, she moves among the Imperial resident and listens in on their conversation. After gauging how many are actually residing in the Cleft and what rooms the officers are staying, she gets to the task at hand. In the process of recalibrating the relays on the levels she sees what she can do about tapping into the comm channels of the rooms the officer’s are staying in. Finishing her tinkering she heads down the levels making her way to the main floor, stopping on each to make the necessary calibrations to the main comm junctions for the floor.
Stepping out into the lobby, she greets KT, busily working away in solving the problem from the small room. The mess of wires a stark contrast to the orderliness of the rest of the Cleft. “**Hey, if you let me in again I can take care of this for you,**” the young mechanic offers her task in recalibrating the comm system nearly complete.

**Perception** +10
***24*** <- [14] 1d20 + 10
As I’m not sure what you would want I’ll just roll the base for both. What I want to accomplish is a way to tie in the comm system for the officer’s rooms to my own comm without making it too noticeable or overtaxing the system.
**Mechanics/Use Computer** +16 (add +2 if Mechanics for the visor)
***30*** <- [14] 1d20 + 16
Since the FP wasn't really needed for above, I ask you use it for the Mechanics/Use Computer check to make it harder to detect my 'modifications'.

The droid, designation KT-80, watches Marina exit the turbolift and opens the hidden hatch for her to enter.
"**Your help, Ms. Cloudspinner, would be most heartily appreciated! I trust your conversation with Manager Norel went well. Already the com-line static has decreased and there are no reported connections dropped in the last… ninety-two minutes, thirty-seven seconds. Please, continue your work.**"
She motions to the mess of wires and returns to her displays, leaving plenty of room for Marina to repair the exposed lines. Her bracer continues to monitor all Imperial communications from the officer's quarters, but so far nothing of note is flagged. The Jedi's subtle use of the Force had revealed a dozen Stormtroopers on routine patrols of the floors and guarding officer's quarters - probably stationed at the hotel on a rotating basis - and three officers, each with their own room. Tapping the com-lines hadn't been too much trouble and as long as no one looked on her repairs with scrutiny, she'd be safe.

Pretty obvious I think. Your success in repairing these lines is assured and if you'd like to fast-forward to reporting back to Norel you're welcome to head back up to his office whenever.

Giving the receptionist droid a smile and a nod at its enthusiasm, Marina gets right to work repairing and finalizing the calibrations. "**You might get a disconnect or two while I fix these splices,**" the young mechanic warns as she untangles a series of comm wires the droid has tried to splice. Eventually she's able to get a sense of the disorder and in almost not time she's placing the final wall panel in place. Wiping her hands on a spare piece of cloth, she puts her mechanical visor away into its respective pouch. “**There you go, KT. Everything is fixed and back in order! Is there anything else while I’m here?**” The last question comes out rhetorically as hopefully Marina has fixed everything in the droid’s vacinity.
With her task done, she heads back to the lift, but rather head back up to Norel’s office the curious young Jedi decides to make a trip down to the basement. It was the last level she had yet to explore in her work on the comm lines and it was worth a look to see if there was anything of interest before she officially completed her work. Punching the button for the basement, she waits for it to lower her to the final level. Once the lift door opens she expands her senses taking in all she can of the level.

Marina takes a step forward and the lift door closes behind her. The whine of its motor fades as it rises and she pauses to sense her surroundings thoroughly. Much of the basement level is hidden in shadow but there are open containers scattered about. These things are no obstacle to a trained Jedi, however, and within moments she has a complete impression of the entire level:
The containers are various imperishable food stores, spare parts for common machines and extra bedding - presumably for the hotel rooms. There are some of each that have been opened, and most of them with force judging by the bent lids. At first Marina has the feeling of being alone, but then she gets a faint sense of something alive in one of the corners farthest from the lifts. The sense grows as she approaches and final sees the source - her unique abilities as a Jedi technician lead her to discover a small false wall near the floor. Behind is a living being that, if her Force senses can be trusted, is fairly young and quite afraid.
The mechanism for opening the hatch is clear, though well-hidden for someone not looking for it. Marina's thoughts are interrupted as her bracer chirps an alert and switches to audio mode:
"**She went *where*?**"
"**The basement level, sir. Thermal sensors picked her up.**
"**Well we can't have that. Take care of things soldier, but keep it quiet.**"
"**Yes sir.**"

One could say "keeping her nose clean" had never been a strong suite for the young Jedi and even knowing that she was perhaps about to have company in the confines of the basement. Having bugged the imperial officer's quarters she had little doubt to their source, but why hide a living creature down here? Knowing there wasn't much time, she activates the switch to the small room. With her hand on the handle of her blaster she prepares herself for what might jump out at her.
This was turning into an interesting day.

The panel makes a small hissing noise as the hidden pneumatic device slides it open. Inside Marina can see a small being covered in shaggy dark fur that, upon being discovered, lets out a shrill scream and scampers away down a darkened tunnel. Apparently the panel is meant to conceal more than just a small compartment - it's an exit for some sort of passageway. The occupant - almost certainly a young Wookie - could make its way through the tunnel much quicker than Marina and there's little hope of catching it before the darkness completely envelops it. Able to concentrate a few moments longer, she can discern through the Force that it goes on for quite some distance in a fairly straight line on a small downward incline - and is no more than a meter across at its widest point. Her best guess it goes on for at least fifty meters. She is unable to maintain her focus, however, as the unmistakable sound of turbolift doors is heard quite clearly from across the basement.
"**The sensors are triggered all the way back. Stay alert.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

A couple things: 1) I wrote *thermal sensors* and I wasn't thinking something like cameras - essentially its like on of those hunting cameras that takes a picture when tripped except instead of taking a picture is sets of a (silent) alarm. Marina would understand that. 2) We're not using a map for this but imagine Marina is about 20 spaces from the lift and there's plenty of crates and whatnot to hide behind. The spot where she's currently standing/crouching has cover/concealment in the form of one large unopened crate. She could have a view of the lift, but is behind the crate and would have to peek out to see the "visitors". 3) Your post says her handle is on her blaster - it's not yet drawn. 4) I realize I didn't exactly clarify that the comms were from the Imperial channels, but I think you picked up on that. Let me know if you've got questions, I'm sure I missed something!

The shrill scream of the young Wookie startles Marina and it runs off before she can reassure it. Obviously its been hiding in here awhile and probably making off with the stores. Peering down the dark tunnel, she tries for a moment to get a sense of the direction the tunnel is going before her thoughts are interrupted by the sounds on the turbolift doors opening. Removing her hand from her blaster, she makes a quick decision. She has a valid reason to be down here after all, why should she have to run? Hitting the pneumatic control for the door, she yells to get the newcomers' attentions, using the words to cover the slight hissing sound and once the door is closed starts making her way toward them. "**Hey you! What good timing! Came down here to check out the power distribution for the comm lines and man… What a mess!**"
As she moves she keeps a wary sense of their presence in relation to the nearest bit of cover in the event they start firing on her. "**Looks like we've got rats or something.**"

You'll note I did not draw my blaster yet again.

Imperial Stormtroopers - four of them - exit the lift and fan out, blaster rifles at the ready and trained on Marina. After hearing her explanation, they pause and converse briefly on a private channel through their helmet comlinks. A few tense moments later the lead trooper motions for her to enter the lift.

Marina holds up her hands as she comes into view of the Stormtroopers' raised blasters in a placating gesture and pretends to look utterly confused by the happenings. "**Uh, ya. Sure,**" she says taking steps toward the small squad and the lift. "**Er… what's going on?**"

"**I imagine that'll be the first question you hear too. Let's go.**"
An ordinary turbolift can easily carry several passengers without exceeding safety parameters but surrounded by the four armored guards as she is, Marina still feels a little too close for comfort. They travel up through most of the building and come to a stop on the second-highest floor. This is the uppermost level occupied by Imperials, as Marina already knows, and she is led down the hallway past several sentries and into one of the rooms. It has been converted into a rather effective office of sorts and sitting at a desk on the far wall in front of the large window is a older-looking gentleman. His grey uniform hangs on his frame crisply, his authority beyond doubt.
"**Ah yes, Miss… Cloudspinner is it? I am Commander Chayse. I'm sorry to have taken you from your *work*,**" he emphasizes the word with a slight hint of accusation - or threat, "**but it seems you had wandered into the basement level. That area is off-limits to non-Imperial personnel.**"
Her escorts turn and leave the two alone in the room. The walls are mostly bare and aside from the desk and chair - which Chayse is occupying - there's little else in the room. The window gives a clear view of the city - a sight Marina is becoming used to. The door slides shut and Commander Chayse seems to await her response, or excuse, for her presence in the basement.

The young Jedi shifts uncomfortably on the way up to the top Imperial floor, surrounded by the impeccably white plasteel armor of the Stormtroopers. She’s mindful to keep her mouth shut and lets some of her unease show through. As the doors open and she’s led onto the 2nd floor of the Imperial controlled levels, she hopes she hasn’t gotten herself into more trouble than she can handle. She forces herself to stay calm and not overreact to the fact she’s potentially been caught. Right now they probably only thought of her as a nosey tech.
Finding herself in the sparsely converted office, she stands in front of the desk like she imagines a naughty school child would find herself in front of the principal. Suffice to say, the imagery serves to inspire a certain sense of contriteness in the young Jedi. One she hopes works in her favor in this interview with the commander. Even with her focus on the uniformed gentleman in front of her, she senses the guards turn and leave them alone.
“**I’m afraid, sir, I didn’t realize it was off limits. Norel certainly didn’t mention it when I took the contract. It must have slipped his mind, er sir**” she says truthfully. “**I went down there to make sure the storm last night didn’t affect the power distributors to the comm lines, and well, got distracted by the sight of the raided stores. I was about to go report it to Norel when your men showed up.**”

Commander Chayse listens intently at first to Marina's story, and then settles into a somewhat disinterested posture.
"**I see. I'm sure Norel *forgot* to tell you about our recent arrangement. Our com-lines seem to have cleared up, and I suppose *that* was your work as well…**" He eyes Marina suspiciously before continuing, "**In the future please remember to stay out of the basement level. You will find the Emperor is forgiving but he - and by extension we - will not be defied. The galaxy is changing, Ms. Cloudspinner, those who are not able to change with it will discover the price of resistance. The Empire will very soon be in every system, on every planet and in every city, village and backwater spaceport. Forgetful hotel managers and their technicians would do well to remember this.**"

Marina resists the urge to snip back a retort concerning his threat of Imperial dominance and instead continues with her contrite appearance. Her excuse having won over the now bored Commander she was glad when she could mutter a "**Yes, sir,**" and take her leave.
Glad to have gotten out of the office with only the proverbial hand slapping she makes a bee-line for the lift and doesn't hesitate to punch the button for the 10th floor. It's only once the doors have closed and she's alone that she let's out her heavy sigh of relief. *That was too close.* Exiting the lift she heads towards Norel's office and knocks on the door to his office to announce her presence.

"**Yes? Come in! Marina, good to see you back. Everything seems to be fine now, and just in time for lunch.**"
Marina enters the office and finds it much as before, Norel at his desk with a myriad of reports on little screens all over its surface. Just as she begins to sit down he stands up and, tossing her a credit chip, continues: "**Here's your payment, with the promised bonus. As for lunch - shall we?**" He motions for a side door to a private lift. "**I believe *long-term arrangements* are best discussed on a full stomach…**"
The two travel up to the roof and exit onto a small landing pad where Norel's own airspeeder is parked. A droid attendant opens the door for them to climb in. "**Good morning Manager Norel, time for lunch is it?**"
"**Good morning J3, and you got it.**"
Norel and Marina both enter the airspeeder and J3 closes the door behind them before entering the driver's front seat. There's a window separating the front from the back, and they sit across from each other as they watch *The Cleft* drop beneath them. J3 makes his way leisurely through Lower Tyrena as Norel addresses Marina:

No sooner has Marina sat down at the manager's desk than he's standing and tossing her the credit chip. She catches it easily and unthinkingly, the act barely a test of her honed Jedi reflexes. Motioning for her to join her in the lift she finds herself in the uncomfortable situation of having to follow him. While she knew they would be discussing her future employment she didn't think it would be over lunch. Stepping into the lift she tugs uncomfortably on the bottom of her jacket. Her unease is doubled as they're ushered into the back of Norel's private air speeder.
"Yea, well... I apparently didn't get the memo about it being off limits." Admittedly that probably wouldnt have kept her out, she just would have gone in with more caution. She shrugs to show she wasn't going to hold it against him. "He at least decided to be magnanimous and not throw me in the brig."

Norel chuckles, and looks out the window before replying.
"**Well, I *did* say to go wherever you wanted I suppose…**"
He turns back to Marina and gives an apologetic shrug:
"**It was an honest mistake. Hotel managers don't know much about com-lines, you know. A bigger mistake, however, would be trusting that anything our good commander does is out of magnanimity. Now *there's* an arrangement I'm regretting more and more…**"
A few moments pass in silence as Norel watches out the window again. The growing Empire has been generous enough to those willing to temporarily harbor its officers, but Norel Jax knowns not to mistake generosity with coercion. They would have him think he had a choice in the matter - something he doubts very much.
"**So now,**" he says, changing the subject and tone of the conversation, "**You've had your opportunity, what now? We certainly have room for a Technical Advisor on staff at *The Cleft*, if you're interested…?**"

"**Why are they staying at your hotel anyways? You would think they'd be content to stay on their base.**"

Norel's disgust is evident in his last remark.
"**No, just be *careful*. The Empire has a habit of being a little too nosy. Some of us think it's bad for business, others seem to benefit from it. And yet,**" he hesitates, studying Marina carefully, "**There are those who would wish to *avoid* scrutiny I think.**"
For a brief moment Marina can see an altogether new expression on Norel's face, a hint that, for just a second, maybe he's more than just a successful manager of a middle-class hotel. It vanishes as he returns to the topic of employment:
"**But as for your position, I would say the responsibilities would be similar to what you've already done today.

If only he knew she had bugged his lines, maybe she would confess it if it seemed appropriate. The young Jedi is about to question him about what he meant by his last comment, thinking the man seems to know a great deal more than he’s letting on when he changes the subject. She stores her question away for a later time.
“**The position seems agreeable to me. I must admit I’m not intending on a permanent position. Being planet side has never agreed with me and I’m not much for staying in one place too long. If they opportunity comes up, I’ll likely catch whatever job comes my way that gets me off this rock.**”

He's clearly no supporter of Emperor Palpatine but seems to have vented his disgust earlier and now resumes in more of a business tone. Before long the vehicle lands outside *The Gem* - a restaurant in the heart of Upper Tyrena that caters to a class of people that Marina hasn't yet seen during her time on Corellia.

The young Jedi listens cordially and puts in her own thoughts to keep up the small talk, but as her interest had never been into politics she takes it in with mild indifference storing the information should it be useful. When the speeder lands outside the restaurant she eyes it with wide-eyed fascination. The difference between this area and the one she had found some refuge in was noticeable. Norel’s business must be good if he could afford to eat here every day for lunch.
Marina's head cocks to the side in question at his comment about establishing things, maybe she had revealed more than she intended. Norel seemed to mean more than he said. “**If it’s not much of an imposition,**” she starts, and flashes him a smile, her deep blue eyes twinkling. Marina was finding herself liking the man the more she talked to him. “**It’s rare to find such generosity these days. It’s rather refreshing. Thank you.**” After the contention she had with the crew of her last employment it had almost made her a pessimist. Now if she could only lose whoever was following her she would be set in her enthusiasm to keep going.

"**Shall we?**"
The pair enter *The Gem* through large duraplex doubledoors as J3 takes off behind them. Once inside, Marina senses are almost overloaded as the sights and sounds - and smells - of the excessively rich wash over her. Surely none of the patrons here has ever set *foot* on a tramp freighter, never mind been *kicked off* one. Crystal chandeliers, exquisite artwork and well-dressed waitstaff weaving deftly through the sea of finery - all leave the distinct impression on Marina that she may be a bit under-dressed. The impression fades as Norel smiles and takes her arm, nudging her to proceed further in. They reach a table by the window and Norel pulls her chair out for her as one of the waiters - a handsome young Twi'lek with pale green skin - approaches.
"**Manager Jax, a pleasure to see you again sir.**"
"**Likewise Tayt,**" Norel replies, taking his seat. The two discuss the need for menus briefly and decide that two of whatever he had last time would suffice. Norel Jax appears to be a man of many faces: some professional, some less-so, but always with a warmth of generosity and genuine interest in others. Tayt leaves the table with a small bow.

It was hard for the young woman not to stare in wide eyed wonder at the visage of the upscale restaurant. Having never had a reason to visit such upscale establishments during her travels as a Jedi, she finds that she had been missing out. Looking at the finery of the other patrons, Marina felt suddenly inappropriately dressed in her worn leather jacket, slacks and boots. Her thoughts of in adequacy are interrupted as Norel takes her arm and guides her in further toward a window table. As he draws out her chair, she notices the Twi’lek waiter approach their table and the two chat for a few moments before the waiter departs. Her gaze and attention has shifted out the window, still astounded by the difference of the quality of life those in Upper Tyreena had compared to those in the distract they had just come from.
His question makes her jump slightly, startled from her reverie. “**Yet fixing things is my trade,**” she starts with a small smile. “**I had a disagreement with the crew on my last freight haul, the captain asked me to leave before things got too hot. Just so happens this is where the captain dropped me off.**” She gives a little shrug at the highly condensed story of her latest woe. While she missed being on a ship, she doubted things would end up pleasantly had she stayed.
Taking a sip if the water the waiter had left for them she casts a curious glance at Norel. There was certainly more to the man that met the eye. “**What about you? Been in the hotel business for long?**”

Norel ponders his answer a few moments before answer Marina. He chooses his words carefully:
"**I've always been a firm believer in saving for the future. When I was younger I had a vision… of sorts. I had been used to living frugally, shunning most material possessions - including a permanent residence - and traveling about with the closest of companions. Many of my associates and I agreed that something big was on the horizon. Sensing our old professions were swiftly becoming obsolete, we decided to pool our resources and invest in a number of businesses throughout the galaxy. Some of us have been successful, though I think there are fewer of us now than we once had hoped. The Empire has grown beyond our greatest expectations and that can be very good, or very bad, depending on the nature of your business pursuits. Every now and then we come across someone like yourself that may be a good fit for our enterprise and the offer of employment - freelance, of course - is made. I think you have a very unique talent, Marina, and I'd hate to see you settle for less than you're capable of.**"
Before he can go any further, Tayt approaches with an entree that smells amazing. He sets small plate in front of Marina and then Norel, refills their glasses, and retreats to his other duties.
"**So to answer your question, it's only been a few years since I took over management of *The Cleft*, but I've been anticipating this line of work for a long time. I like to think of myself as serving others - there's plenty of tyrants to go around nowadays - and it seems to be working out pretty well.**"

Marina picks at the side salad as she reflects on his words. Three years would have placed the start of his current occupation around the start of the Clone Wars, but from the sounds of it he had been planning the move for a longer period before that. More interesting was the way he described his lifestyle: frugal, immeterialistic, nomadic. He was in essence describing the life of a Jedi or at least someone who had been affiliated with the Order. Most of those within the attached Corps lived and worked similarly.
Going on her hunch, she takes a determined bite of her salad and reaches out tentatively toward Norel. If he was sensitive then he would likely detect her probing, but it was also likely he already knew what she was so that didn’t concern her. “**You’ve certainly done well for yourself, having started with very little,**” she says tentatively.

Reaching out cautiously, Marina tries to detect any Force-sensitives in the surrounding area. Her search comes up empty, with two exceptions:
The first is a very young Wookie, located near the basement level of *The Cleft*, currently asleep and somewhat scared from the days' events. The second turns out to be none other than Norel Jax.
*Jedi Knight Joran Nor, actually…*
The telepathic response is accompanied by a quick wink from her new employer across the table as he munches on his salad casually. "**True,**" he replies in between bites, "**But like I said, we were prepared. And the position allows me to help folks out occasionally, when they really need it.**"

Yeah, that looks good. I'll fast-forward the lunch in my next post to get back to the hotel if you're all set. Have another 1000XP for finally putting those Force powers to use and making a friend.

Marina had to forcefully keep herself from jumping from his telepathic probe, an act she hadn't been expecting from the older man. She'd been on the run too long, getting all jumpy. *I wonder what a vacation would feel like, no worries or pressing business. Not having to worry about the wrong people discovering you were a Jedi.* Vacation... ha, like that was ever going to happen. She puts the thought away and finishes off the salad and begins to work on the main dish of specially prepared fish. It had been cooked in some sort of sauce which seemed to hide the usual fishy smell. As she eats she considers the man in front of her.
*A Jedi Knight, huh?* He had done something she perhaps hadn't had the courage to, leave the Order, even when she had the perfect opportunity. Only Silas had known vaguely where she had gone, maybe he would have understood. "**In a way I'm jealous… You were able to do something I could not.**" Having voiced the thought, the young Jedi looked down at her food, suddenly ashamed for it.

"**Yet we all walk different paths. You needn't regret the past to change the future. I think you'll find plenty of distractions working at *The Cleft*…**"
Norel skillfully turns the conversation towards more business-focused once again, cognizant of their public surroundings. Jedi risk much meeting in these times and he knows it, but the Empire isn't so vast that there aren't some safe places. This restaurant, however, may not be one of them. The two enjoy the meal and small talk, with ample opportunity to get to know each other without dwelling too much on the common - but outlawed - past they share. They finish and Norel bids goodbye to Tayt, the waiter, as he and Marina head out to meet J3. During the ride home, Norel resumes their earlier topic of conversation without the pretenses.
"**Don't worry, we're safe in here. Your probe was a bold move, there are Imperial spies of all kinds around these days - can't say I blame you. Sometimes I tend to be a little overly cautious… I don't know the name *Cloudspinner* - were you at Geonosis?**"

Marina shifts in the seat, now a bit more at ease knowing she's in like minded company. With a nod she responds to his direct line of questioning. "**I was. My master and I arrived during the later course of the battle and attempted to prevent the Geonosians from disabling their manufacturing plants.**" She shrugs away the fleeting memories she had of the place and of the subsequent death of her master and father figure.
To drive them away fully she gives a small laugh moving onto the next thought. "**I'm not surprised you don't as it's not really my name. Cloudspinner was my father's family name, though I don't think he used it much. The name I took as a Padawan was Numa.**"

## Re: Bit By Bit (Marina Numa's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-04 15:18:50)

Norel smiles and nods to the younger Jedi, "**Nice to meet you, Marina Numa. Joran Nor, Jedi Knight.**"
He reflects on that fateful day not so long ago...
"**Yes, that was a dark day. Many of us were lost to the machines, and Palpatine certainly had us all convinced. I was almost killed - a pair of droidekas that were mowing down the ranks. I managed to dispatch them, but the final round from the second one caught me square in my chest. I spent a long time flirting with the Light. Eventually I came to in a sickbay, months later, having received a true vision of the Empire. I shared it with my closest brothers, not wanting to draw too much attention but unable to dismiss it entirely. We did our best to change the course of things but I suppose we were naive enough to think it would matter. Starting up false identities with sound financial investments was only a part of what we did. In the end we escaped '66 and scattered, vowing to search out others and do everything within our power to fight the Emperor and restore the Order. I now know that's not fully possible, but giving up seems like a victory for that Palpatine. We can't have that, now can we?**"
He chuckles and takes a deep breath, betraying the anxiety of a hero-turned-outlaw that Marina can identify with all too easily.
"**So you were in the basement, eh?**" he asks, raising one eyebrow mischievously...

Marina nods her agreement with his assessment of the battle as a whole. Peacekeepers were called in as the vangaurd to a war. What else could be expected? "**The fact Palpatine has himself so entrenched into the government will make things difficult for sure. Suppose we'll have to bide our time.**" She makes a face at her next comment, "**I was never good at being patient.**"
Smiling sheepishly she recounts her experience in the basement. "**I didn't realize they had it monitored… I probably would have been more careful if I did, could have avoided that thermal trap they have set up.**” Frowning in concentration she remarks, “**Did you know they’re hunting a Wookiee youngling hiding in your basement?**”

## Re: Bit By Bit (Marina Numa's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-07 10:43:50)

"**So you *did* meet her!**" Norel laughs, clearly pleased at Marina's discovery.
"**No, they're not hunting *her* - at least not specifically. Kitkkata's pretty good at hiding on her own, and when she's got a little help from friends… she'll be fine. Chayse was probably more worried about you stumbling onto his private foodstuffs. The thermal sensors are my own suggestion, and are excellent at picking up signatures from Humans. I may have neglected to include Wookie profiles in it though…**" he smiles mischievously again. "**Remember what I said about helping others? I found her wandering the streets a few months ago. The Empire seems to delight in employing slave labor and Wookies make pretty easy targets so I took her in. There's a passage in the basement that leads into some of the old access tunnels under the city. I'm sure you noticed her Force sensitivity, all the more reason to take her in.**"

Marina nods. “**I’m afraid I gave her a bit of a scare when I found her in the tunnel. She ran off, which was probably a good thing as those bucket heads were coming for me.**” She was relieved that they weren’t hunting for the youngling specifically, but it would probably only be a matter of time before she got caught. If she was stealing from the Commander’s stores, how long would it be before he realizes that his security measures aren’t working and stations a guard down there.”**Maybe I should see about taking her with me when I leave. She can’t stay down there forever.**”

"**Plans for leaving already? And I thought lunch went rather well…**"
Norel's face does not display a look of surprise or disappointment however, he is all too familiar with life under Palpatine's rule for surviving Jedi.
"**I'll tell you what: I've got some calls to make, people to meet - business stuff. Shouldn't take more than a day or two. Feel free to talk to KT-80 about a room at the *Cleft* and I'll get back to you about your first assignment. Fair enough?**"
J3 has taken a more direct route home and Marina can already see the landing pad atop the hotel, only moments away.

### **Alicia** (2011-11-07 13:07:16)

Marina smiles sheepishly at his rebuttal, but knew he probably understood her reasoning for staying on the planet longer than was necessary. It was one thing he had been here since the onslaught of the war. It was less likely he'd get called out on being a Jedi, but Marina had little in the way of an identity, nothing that could hold up under scrutiny. Maybe it would just be best for her to find some out of the way planet and hole up somewhere, much like her master Firith Ven had done before she'd been dropped into his lap by Yoda as his new apprentice. An apprentice he hadn't really wanted to begin with. She figures, though, Norel would think that a waste of the talent he proclaims she has. He obviously hasn't realized yet her real talent is getting into trouble and managing to find a way out of it. Her curiosity always seems to get the best of her.
Marina nods at his suggestion and deciding that maybe returning to her previous adobe wasn't going to be in her best interest. Her tracker had made her out at it and would likely be watching it for awhile yet. "**Alright then,**" she says simply. Besides there was some work she wanted to do and it would likely keep her cloistered for awhile. She could check in on her way out into the market to get her materials.

The vehicle comes to a stop, hovering over the pad, and then descends slowly. J3 exits first then opens the door for Norel and Marina to exit.
"**Here you are sir, miss.**"
The two enter Norel's office, where he pauses before heading to his desk: "**Thank you for a most enjoyable lunch. We'll be in touch soon. I'm sure you'll find *plenty* of things to keep yourself occupied.**" he says, smiling at Marina.
They exchange waves as Norel's comlink chirps and he's once more in character. Marina makes her way down to KT-80, the *Cleft*'s main receptionist. She looks up from her work - which appears to be far less hectic than earlier in the day - and acknowledges the technician.
"**Oh, Ms. Cloudspinner! Welcome back! How are things?**" she asks, in her polite but still unmistakably mechanical voice.

Now once again in Norel's office, Marina gives Norel a conspiratorial grin, but doesn't remark of what she'd be getting up to in the time between their meetings. "**Yes thanks for lunch.**" Her next thought is interrupted as the ex-Jedi Knight's comm chirps and she decides it's time to leave. With a wave she lets herself out and heads down into the reception area, just at the top of the restaurant.
"**Hello, KT,**" she says in greeting to the droid. "**Things are fine. I've decided I'm going to get a room here for the next week. Think you could pick out a nice single for me? Something near the ground floor would be preferable.**" Pulling out the credit chip Norel had given her she mentally deducts the 240 credits from it before passing it over to the droid. "**Looks like things are less hectic than earlier. Comm lines being down must have really put a stint in your day.**"

"**We were able to catch up fairly soon after the repairs. It was mostly an inconvenience for some of our…**" KT searches for the correct phrase, "**…distinguished guests. We are now operating at optimal efficiency, thanks in no small part to your help.**"
The droid spends a few moments running Marina's credit chip and looking for available rooms.
"**Here we are - Room 110. Take the lift up to the first floor and it will be down the hall to the right. Anything else, Ms. Cloudspinner?**"<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

Any of the rooms at *The Cleft* are a vast improvement over the damp quarters available where Marina spent her first night, and this one is no exception. The soft carpeted floor of room 110 stretches out into spacious quarters - easily three times the size of her "rooftop suite" - where a small table and chair are setup against one wall, opposite a very comfortable-looking bed. A small eating area is to the right of the doorway, complete with a small bar, two stools, cooking area and a fruit bowl. The fresher is ahead and to the left, just before the desk, and is in spotless condition. The main room has a window that looks out onto the crowded street and Marina can see diner patrons coming and going. A dark red and beige color-scheme, high ceiling, large vidscreen with Holonet access and overall clean appearance makes the room seem altogether more like a furnished apartment than a cheap lodging. It's no wonder Norel has done so well.

In the event that you want to go shopping for anything, that district is about a thirty-minute walk (or you could take a cab) away. Stores include, but are not limited to: Torkin's Emporium (think of it as a Wal-Mart - a little of everything), The Mainframe (electronics, droid stuff, datapad/computers, etc. - Radio Shack), Blasters 'N Bullets (weapons, licenses, ammo, etc.) and Rela's (clothing store with a wide selection for everyone - like a JC Penney's).

After thanking KT for her help, she accepts her credit chip back and puts it back into a pouch as she heads to the lift, curious to see the room before heading out to the shopping distract. As the door to room 110 opens, the young Jedi is immediately impressed.
Letting the door close behind her she takes her first step into her new adobe and takes in her surroundings. Pleased to see the small kitchenette she decides a bit of grocery shopping was probably in order. While one meal was free with her rent, she was on her own for the rest and she doubted she’d be able to stand standard rations for much longer.
Her gaze sweeps over her new apartment a final time before she heads out, deciding a walk there wouldn’t hurt. Stopping first into the mainframe, she’s at first shocked by the high price of the desired processor. Realizing it would probably wipe out most of her funds, she approaches the shop keeper.
“**Greetings!**” she starts “**You run a fine establishment here! But I wonder… your prices seem a bit high. That processor for example. I’ve seen it for at least half that just a parsec away.**”

Marina enters Mainframe, "*Where every bit costs less!*" if the sign is to be believed, and approaches the counter. Shelves line the walls and center racks full of all manner of technological parts and devices in various conditions. Divided roughly into sections, a fair amount of dust covers all but the most commonly used areas. The droid cashier begins to greet her but is pushed aside by an aging Toydarian wearing some sort of goggles and helmet. He looks about as dirty as the rest of the place.
"**Hell-o pretty lady! We have high prices because we have only the finest merchandise, eh? Heh! But you're wanting the basic processor I see, a very fine piece of equipment, no? Ummm… lemme see now, we've got that marked at, uh, one thousand credits. Half-price, eh? You don't say… well… I'll tell ya what I'll do. Today, for you, a special discount, eh? What a deal! But you need more than a processor to make a droid I think, no?**" he replies to Marina, blowing some dust off the item in question.
Her first impression of the place is less of an established place of business and more of a junk shop. Upon closer inspection, however, it becomes clear that this Toydarian knows what he's doing. Almost everything is coated in a layer of particulate, but the backroom - which she can see clearly now behind him - is spotless and stocked with state-of-the art equipment. More than likely the store makes a profit from special orders or some other (less than legal) means.

Marina smiles at the Toydorian warily. It was rare to find one so generous. “**Indeed not. I’m going to need a Shryiiwook language training package,” she says, rattling off the last of them items on her list. “**I have quite a bit of training to get pretty much anything operational. I’m quite good with tech myself,**” she boasts idly catching the sight of the better managed backroom.
“**From the looks of it you do a lot of special orders. Must get some interesting requests come through here,** ” she adds to keep up the conversation, hoping to stroke the Toydorian’s ego a bit more before paying for her items.
Her next stop is the grocer where she gets enough food to last her the next few days, nothing fancy but definitely a lot better than rations, and splurges on some nice smelling shampoo. Deciding it looks unusual for her to be traveling without some sort of luggage, she buys a duffle which she could easily put on her back. She makes good use of it to carry her groceries around and makes a final stop at the clothier, Rela’s.
After asking permission, she sets her bag of foodstuffs by the register yet out of the way of the clerk and customers. Perusing the floor, Marina manages to find a new spare pair of pants and a couple tops and a set of night clothes. After an attempt of friendly chit chat with the clerk, she pays for her items, puts them in the bag and makes the 30 minute hike home. Probably just in time to put everything away for dinner!
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

500 processor + 50 training package = 550cr (unless not everything was half off then it’s 600cr)
I’m assuming food is going to be about 5cr per meal so for 10cr/day. I’ll get three days to start for 35cr + another 10cr for some amenities to be spent at the grocer.
A sturdy travel duffle I’m guessing is going to be around 25 cr.
30cr on clothes
**Total:** 650cr.

Glad to be back, Marina weaves her way through the diner and to the staircase that will take her to the hotel part of building. Tossing a salutation toward KT she steps into the lift and punches the button for her floor. Adjusting the strap of her bag over one shoulder, she impatiently shifts waiting for the door to open onto her floor. Being on the first floor of the hotel she doesn’t have to wait long and soon she’s outside the door of her room, 110. Passing the keycard over the door panel she pushes the door open fully. Taking a glance around, she makes sure nothing has been disturbed before letting the door close behind her with a sign marked “Do Not Disturb” in several different languages attached to it. Moving into the kitchen, she drops her bag of groceries onto the floor and then starts unloading the items into the fridge and cabinets making sure everything had a place. Satisfied, she grabs a change of clothes and shampoo from the duffel dropping the latter outside the door to the refresher and the and eagerly makes use of it.
It wasn’t often she gotten to make full use of a shower and she languidly takes her time in it. Her thoughts begin to wander in the process, but don’t focus on anything in particular. She leaves the shower pruny and much cleanlier, the small refresher steamed up thickly. Changing into her new clothes, she sits on the comfortable bed flipping idly through the various HoloNet channels and makes us of her new comb. Twisting the cord attached to the coral pearl around her wrist, she lets her damp fall down past her shoulders.
Deciding some dinner was in order before she got to work on her new project, she heads down to the diner to partake of a nice filling, hot nerf pot pie with some jawa juice to wash it down with. As she eats, she observes the various patrons, trying to gather who all was actually staying in the hotel and who was just there for the meal. Fully content with her full stomach she passes KT with another hello and makes her way back to her room.
Drawing the curtains, the young Jedi lays out the droid and her tools on the table. Drawing a glass of water from the sink she sits down and gets to work on the droids processor, repairing the rest of the damage as she goes.

<*Beginning systems check…sensors online…motivators online…comlink online…peripherals online…status: operational*>*
The drone rises slowly from the table top, wobbling as final adjustments are made internally. Its sensors take in room's details as it spins in place, careful to examine every possible feature. Finally, returning to its original position facing Marina, it scans her as well. After a few moments, it addresses her in clear Binary:

Holding in a yawn as she puts the final connection into place, she nearly drops the tool as the droid’s lights illuminate and begins to run an initial systems diagnostics and its hover systems kick in. A certain amount of elation at completing the task correctly fills her as it turns its optics to her and reveals its designation. With its request for further instructions she fights back another yawn.
“**B3-D3,**“ she starts, “**Activate standby mode.**” There wasn’t really much else she could do with the droid in her state. After waiting for the droid to confirm her order, she picks it up and sets it down on the bedside table. *Just a few hours meditation should be enough,* she thinks. Taking a seat on the bed, she’s finds herself sorely tempted to just lay back and let herself sleep. Resisting, she finds her center and let’s her thoughts wander.
*Dream*
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

"Courage, Marina. You have been training to handle times such as these." True enough, he had been preparing me for this since I had become his apprentice six years ago at the naive age of ten standard years - a time which seemed so long ago and simple. He just hoped I would never need his training. I also knew training with remotes and being involved in an actual battle were two entirely different situations.
Responding with a nod, I unhooked the lightsaber from my belt. The weight of the hilt was comforting in my hand. The ramp was half lowered as we jumped the rest of the way off the ship. I looked quickly around before turning to the controls to close the ramp and lock the access panel.
When I turned back around I had my first glimpse of the Republic’s newest acquisition. At least, that’s how Ven referred to them. While he had been trained to fight and fight well, he was a peace loving man. The thought a group of individuals, clones or not, had been created solely for the intention of being used in war greatly troubled him.
Ten white armored troopers jumped out of a LAAT/i and ran toward us, wary as they looked about them. Stopping in formation the apparent leader, sporting olive green arm plates and stripe on his helmet, took an additional step forward. Behind them the LAAT/i took off, already recalled for another mission. "General, Commander, CT-1532 reporting.”
Ven nodded to the trooper. "Very good, Sergeant. Let's get to work." He turned and started walking toward the factory designated as a target. "We are to divert the Geonosian saboteurs from further affecting the factories." I walked beside him, still watching the clones curiously over my shoulder. They fell in behind us, taking up defensive positions.
As we neared the factory, I realized how quiet it had become. Up until now, I could hear distance indications of fighting elsewhere. Nearby, however, there was none. Crouching behind a fallen wall, I looked at the datapad I carried on my belt and checked the coordinates. We were in the right place, but there was no sign of the Geonosians reported to have made their way here.
Ven, sensing my uncertainty, whispered to me, "Reach out with your feelings. You will find them." I did as he instructed and did indeed find them. The Geonosians, an insectoid species,, had taken up a position inside the factory's entrance. They were attempting to ambush us. I tried to count how many of them there were, but my mind was suddenly spinning as I sensed more coming in behind us.
"Master..." I looked behind us concerned. They weren't close enough to be in sight, but I knew they were coming straight for us.
"I sense them too." He was looking around for an escape route. A sudden explosion caused the walls of a rock carved building to collapse. Debris and dust filled the air. I tried not to breathe it in as I surveyed the area once more. The escape route we both had been considering was cut off. We were trapped and now outnumbered. "Sergeant, call for backup."
"General, our transmissions are being jammed." Beside me I heard Ven curse quietly in Ryl.
I had gone back to counting the number of Geonosians. Five were in the factory while about twenty were closing in behind us. "Master, we could take the factory and hold position till reinforcements arrive."
"If they haven't rigged the factory to explode already." He was studying the factory ahead of us.
"Won't know till we go in. Besides, I should be able to neutralize any explosives they have set." I had been doing exceedingly well in my lessons concerning demolitions. Never could I fault Ven for giving me a wide range of skills.
"Sergeant, how many grenades do we have?"
"Five thermal detonators and ten frags among us, General."
"That should be plenty. Marina, set several detonators here to detonate manually. You," he said indicating a trooper. "Stay here and cover her. Rest of you, with me." A few of the troopers handed me a couple detonators before following Ven, firing shots toward the factory entrance to cover the charge. Ven activated his silver blade, deflecting blaster bolts fired from within. I quickly recovered from my momentary lapse as I sensed the Geonosians, having heard the sounds of combat, pick up their pace.
I looked at the detonators for a moment and then at the crumbling wall where I had taken cover. Pulling out my kit I set about my task of rigging the charges with practiced motions. The remaining trooper watched as I worked. I carefully hid the detonators amoung the debris around the wall, camoflaging them as best I could.
A shot whizzed by my head, indicating I had run of time. Grasping a grenade in my right hand and activating my lightsaber in my left I prepared for our retreat. "Let's go." The trooper was on the other side of the wall and had already begun returning fire. Quickly calculating the distance, I called on the Force to place the grenade in a mound of loose sand in between us and the Geonosians. The resulting explosion kicked up a large cloud of dust creating the diversion I had hoped for. Making a run for it we made it safely to the now captured factory.
We were greeted by three troopers placed to guard the entrance. As we neared, they began firing at the rapidly approaching Geonosians behind us. They weren't, however, close enough to the wall outcropping. I moved deeper into the factory's entrance hall. Ven was surveying the wounds a few of the troopers had sustained and applying bandages where needed.
"Charges are set, Master." I handed him the detonator. "Any sign of explosives in here?"
"None, take these two and get to work," he said indicating two of the wounded troopers he had been working on.
"Yes, Master." Without another word, I gestured for the troopers to follow and proceeded down the hallway. The power to the building had been disconnected forcing us to activate a series of glow rods to compensate. The Geonosians had crafted their buildings into the stone. While some of the buildings were reminiscent of termite hills they also carved underground. This factory was one such subterranean structure. The first couple levels housed the spare parts and materials used in production while the levels below that contained the factory itself.
The two wounded troopers and I found several Geonosian stragglers, but nothing to indicate they had set any charges. With some apprehension, we continued further into the factory using the emergency access ladders to delve further undergroud. A sudden explosion on the surface caused me to smile slightly as I reached out toward a rock wall to steady myself. There was a small cracking sound and I could see parts of the ceiling and walls begin to crack around us. The thermal detonators I had set at the crumbled wall had detonated. I focused my senses toward the surface, trying to determine what damage they had caused. The blast had taken out some of the Geonosians' dwindling party leaving about seven to be dealt with. We were about to continue down the dark passageway when another explosion rocked the factory, this time causing the walls and ceiling to begin collapsing.
"Uh oh... Not good. Fall back." I reached out with the Force, placing pressure on the weakest parts of the ceiling and walls around us in an attempt to give us more time. As it took most of my concentration to do this; one of the troopers ran beside me, holding my elbow to keep me from tripping. I lost track of how long we were moving, but it seemed like ages before we arrived back at the access shaft to the higher levels. No longer able to concentrate, the passageway we just passed through collapsed. "Move it," I ordered breathlessly. The two troopers didn't hesitate as they mounted the ladder and began the climb upward. When I reached the top, one of the troopers grabbed my arms, pulling me out of the shaft. I paused a moment to catch my breath, taking the time to survey our surroundings. The explosions apparently hadn't affected the upper levels of the factory, but I guessed it wouldn't be long before it too became unstable.
"Commander?" One of the troopers looked down on me, his tone concerned.
"Let's go, we should get back to the others." I didn't wait for a response as I turned, running toward the entrance.
The sight that met us there was devastating. Three troopers had been pulled back from the entrance, and were lying almost motionless on the stone floor. Ven was standing near the entrance, deflecting some of the shots back toward the Geonosians with ease. The two troopers who had accompanied me took up a position at the opening, joining their five remaining squad mates. Noticing our arrival; Ven backed further into the factory toward me. He deactivated the silver lightsaber, holding it easily in his hand by his side.
"Find anything?"
I shook my head. "No, we had to discontinue the search when the subterranean levels became unstable. The second explosion destabilized the foundation."
"That's too bad. The Geonosians outside are becoming increasingly difficult targets. Since we are still unable to contact reinforcements..." He was cut off by a loud thud. But Ven didn't have to finish the sentence. We were pinned. He looked back over his shoulder as one of our troopers collapsed against the wall. He had taken a direct hit. The trooper behind him grabbed the back of his armor, pulling his wounded squad mate out of the way and then taking his place.
"What are we going to do, Master?" I asked him quietly. "We can't stay here."
Ven nodded, looking toward the opening. There was a short lull in the blasts coming through. "What would you suggest?"
I sighed. Even in the direst of circumstances, he was always testing me. I thought for a moment. "We could fall further back into the factory. Have them come after us in the hope we can take them out in the close quarters." There wasn't much the two of us could do from a distance. In close quarters, we could easily handle the remaining Geonosians.
"Or they will wait for their own reinforcements or for the likelihood the building will collapse on us."
"There's going to be risk in anything we try, Master."
He waited, turning to look at me once more.
"We could press forward. Surprise them with the sudden charge. Do we still have some grenades?" With a nod from Ven, I continued. "When we get close enough we can use the grenades to disorient them further or take them out completely." I paused a moment. This was probably our best bet. Ven was right; they could wait for reinforcemtents to arrive and who knew how long the structure would remain standing. At any moment it could collapse right on top of us.
"Sergeant, prepare for a charge. We will provide cover until you're close enough to bombard them with the remaining grenades."
The sergeant looked back at Ven briefly and then began relaying orders to the rest of the squad. Only six were able to stand. Outside I could sense five Geonosians holding their ground in ruins war the wall had been.
I reached for my lightsaber, only to find it was gone. "Uh oh." I looked down at my belt and checked the pouches. My datapad was gone as well. I must have lost them during the cave in.
"What is it, Marina?"
"Um..." This wasn't going to pleasant. Especially after the many lectures over the years of such irresponsibility. "My lightsaber is gone," I answered sheepishly, waiting for the lecture I was sure to get.
Instead he sighed, "We will discuss this later." He passed over the lightsaber he held in his hand, already reaching for the backup he kept hidden. He activated it and a silver blade came to life. The brother to the lightsaber I held in my hand. This was the first time he allowed me use to one of his sabers. We had always been able to retrieve mine in the past or, if not, had the time to rebuild it. Already I was close to being able to build my own.
The lightsaber I held was thicker than most with the activation switch set near the top of the hilt. The hand grip consisted of a protruding spiral which wrapped around and was offset by beveled glyphs following along the spiral to the bottom. Ven pulled me out of my examination of the hilt by heading toward the entrance; the hum of his lightsaber becoming increasingly distant as he moved away. Swiftly, I activated my borrowed lightsaber, hefting it in my hand to accustom myself to the change. Satisfied with how it felt in my hand, I took my place on the other side of the exit from Ven. I knew what to expect from this tactic. We would head out in front with the troopers, providing cover till we reached optimal range for them to toss grenades at the Geonosians. How hard could this be? I winced... Why did I just ask that? I took a deep breath, calming my sudden nerves.
On the other side of the exit, Ven was looking from me to the Geonosians. He gave a deliberate nod, his signal. Stepping out in sync, we instantly began redirecting blaster bolts from ourselves and the troopers behind us. Ven was able to send a good deal of them back toward the Geonosians causing them to duck for cover. I, however, barely managed to cover my side of the formation. Concentrating on the blaster fire I matched Ven's pace as we made our way steadily toward the entrenched Geonosians. Behind us, the troopers continued to fire at the Geonosians, and then, finally, we were in range. Massive explosions rang in my ears as the remaining frag grenades detonated.
Then it was quiet save for the hum of our two lightsabers. Our squad moved cautiously through the dust. Blinking rapidly, I tried to clear my eyes of the irritating dust and was forced to close them when they started to burn. Thankfully, I didn't need my eyes to see. I compensated by reaching out with the Force and allowed it to guide me forward. I couldn't sense any surviving Geonosians here. Overhead I could hear the familiar sound of the LAAT/i returning. Nearby I heard the squad sergeant requesting pickup.We had done it.
The dust slowly cleared, but it was made worse by the approaching LAAT/i which set down a dozen or so meters away. I turned to a few of the troopers beside me. "Go collect the wounded." They saluted to me before running off to fulfill my command. Looking around, I was struck by the carnage. Decimated and burning Geonosian corpses littered the ground only outnumbered it seemed by the piles of debris. I grew sick. Leaning against the remains of the wall, I attempted to focus on something other than what I saw around me.
"Commander?" The sergeant was suddenly standing beside me, obviously concerned. I looked at him and saw his helmet was off, held under is arm.
"Yes, Sergeant?" I fought with the undesirable urge to purge the contents on my stomach.
"We have droids closing in on our position, Commander."
"Have all men been accounted for?"
"General Ven and a few of the others are still retrieving the injured." Looking over toward the collapsing factory, I saw the three troopers helping their comrades toward the LAAT/i. There was no sign of Ven.
"Let's be ready to go once they are back." The troop sergeant nodded and made his way back to the transport. I followed him, matching his pace to walk at his side.
"Commander?" I had been staring at him. Now that there was a lull in combat my curiosity had come out in full force.
"Uhm... I was just wondering..." The sergeant looked at me waiting. "Is that really your name? CT-1532?"
"This is neither the time nor the place for that sort of question, Commander." He looked off toward the factory. I sighed at his response. He was right of course, but that never really kept me from asking such questions.
"I'm guessing that's a 'yes'." I thought a moment, looking off in the same direction. The troopers were moving slowly toward us. "Kaden." He turned his head to look. If he didn't have his helmet on, I would have met his gaze. I settled for looking at the "t" shaped visor. "Sergeant Kaden. It has a rather nice ring to it, don't you think?" Kaden considered me a moment. I smiled at him, and then turned back toward the transport.
The troopers were more than halfway to the transport when the first rank of droids came within firing range. The resemblance between the Geonosians and the B-1 battle droids they had produced was uncanny. Taking cover in the LAAT/i, the troopers returned fire. I turned and ran toward the retreating troopers to provide cover with my lightsaber. Ven was still nowhere in sight. "Where is he? Where is Master Ven?" I yelled to the troopers, deflecting a few shots coming our way. The noise level was beginning to increase again.
"He's still inside, CT 1478 was having difficulties and the general stayed behind."
I swore fluently in Ryl, and then hissed as I took a shot to my leg. I resumed my concentration of deflecting the incoming fire, limping slowly toward the LAAT/i with the troopers following behind. Troopers from the transport reached down and started hauling their squad mates inside. I remained outside still staring at the factory. Where was he?
"Commander, we need to leave. Our position is being overrun," Kaden called, holding out an arm to pull me inside.
"Master Ven is still inside. We can't leave just yet." My attention was turned toward the factory, looking for any sign that Ven would emerge from inside.
"There's no time." He had jumped out of the transport and took the few steps to approach me. "I'm sorry for this, Commander," he said, just as he picked me up and tossed me into the transport. He leapt in beside me just in time to prevent me from jumping out again. The transport lifted up and shook slightly as blaster fire impacted the plating.
"You are out of line, Sergeant," I said, glaring at him. "Turn back now!" Then I turned my attention to outside the craft to where the factory was. There was still no sign. The droids were steadily making their way closer to the factory.
Kaden shook his head. "Sorry, Commander. You're welcome to send in a reprimand."
No... That I wouldn't do. How could I reprimand him for doing his duty, when I had almost failed to do mine? I was suddenly hit by the extent of what just happened. Could he really be gone? Or having taken refuge inside the factory, was he still waiting? I reached out with the Force, using the bond which had formed between us over the years to home in on him. I found nothing.
He was gone. I could no longer sense him in the Force. My knees buckled beneath me as I was suddenly overwhelmed by the emotions I felt. Kaden caught me and led me to a bench without a word. My head was bowed forward as I fought with the emotions which threatened to take over.
Firith Ven was gone.

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-16 15:19:17)

Marina's meditation takes her well into daylight - the usual morning rush in the diner is over downstairs before she emerges, well-rested and ready for the day. Whether it was her comlink that had pulled her from her thoughts or just a coincidence is unclear, but it was intercepting another priority Imperial transmission. The first voice was unmistakably Commander Chayse:
"***More Jedi traitors! Well now we have two fish to reel in, don't we? How's that filthy bounty hunter doing with his assignment?***"
"***I'm not sure sir, he hasn't checked in yet.***"
"***Unreliable alien scum! If he's decided to… nevermind. We've got enough on our plate as it is. Are the barracks operational yet?***"
"***Yes sir. Apparently there were some last minute repairs, but our maintenance team reports ready-status.***"
"***Good. I want us out of this building within the hour, understood? I expect to have the situation well in hand by this evening.***"
"***Yes sir!***"

### **Alicia** (2011-11-30 11:48:54)

Marina listened intently to the transmission, wishing she could somehow have heard the first part. From the sounds of it though it wasn’t going to matter as soon they would be moving into the Imperial barracks.
For a long moment the young Jedi sits there, contemplating everything she had overheard. It wouldn’t do to be hasty there were lives on the line, but whose? Did they know about Norel or the child or had they found a Jedi sympathizer or another Jedi? Too many ‘or’s came to mind. She needed more information and she needed to warn Norel if he and the Wookee child was in danger.
Could she risk a telepathic touch? No... she wasn’t skilled enough in that art to pass along more than a few simple thoughts and emotions. She was going to have to go and warn him physically. For that she was going to need a reason. With grim determination she began recording a report on her bracer computer, putting in as much technical babble as she could muster. When she had written as much as she thought might bore any casual reader she began to construct her true message using a code schema Norel would most likely know.
*Intercepted message for Chayse. Hunt for two in progress. Not safe. Imperials leaving within hour. Wants situation dealt by evening.*
Glancing over the made up report, Marina frowned at it, hoping it would be obvious to Norel, but not for anyone who might intercept it. It was going to have to do. Packing her gear together and stuffing non perishable foods into her bag she gets it ready should she have the opportunity to come back for it. For a long moment she debates if she should attempt to hide her lightsaber. Deciding she didn’t want to be parted from it, she secures it in the hidden pocket of her jacket. Picking up the newly activated remote, she secures it to her belt.
Feeling ready, she makes her way to the lift and up to Norel’s office.

Marina leaves her room on the first floor and makes for Norel Jax's office on the uppermost level. Her ride in the lift is short but even without using the Force she can sense growing tension in the building. The doors slide open and she steps out to an unexpected sight:
To Marina's right is Norel's office, about ten meters away, with its door closed. To her left is half a dozen armed Stormtroopers headed in her direction. Behind them she can see smaller teams working through some of the other administrative rooms, herding various droids and *Cleft* employees out into the hallway. The closest, his armor coloration reflecting his superiority over the others, is also about ten meters from where Marina stands.
The sunlight pouring in from windows and skylights makes for a deceptively serene appearance to everything, and the sound of the troopers marching is perforated only by the occasional startled worker being escorted into the hallway. The lift doors behind her begin to shut as she hears the unmistakable mechanized voice of the squad leader:
"**You there - halt!**" he shouts, drawing a blaster pistol. The two soldiers flanking him raising their blaster rifles. The hallway is just wide enough for three to stand side-by-side but their current configuration is two columns of three each with the leader in the front center.

Not sure if you have any Destiny bonuses going on, so maybe that's worth checking out first. You've got plenty of options here and I won't give you any advice, other than to say that "*about ten meters*" is 6 spaces away in either case.

## Re: Bit By Bit (Marina Numa's Story)

### **Alicia** (2011-12-05 09:20:16)

Marina’s plans to warn Norel are forgotten as she sees the squad of Stormtroopers rounding up his staff. Spotting Norel’s door closed her hope of getting to him quickly diminishes and she fears he’s already in their custody. As the squad’s leader turns his attention to her she quickly back peddles squeezing between the doors of the closing lift. Punching the button to the reception level, she pulls out her lightsaber from within the confines of her inside jacket pocket. After quickly gauging the density of the lift’s doors she runs the blade of her saber over the seam where they met, quickly welding the doors together from the inside.
The usually reassuring presence of the saber in her hand is opposed by her sudden anxiety of being caught with it. She had survive this long without it proclaiming her prior allegences, but now, since she assumed they knew what she was, it didn’t matter that she had it or not. Pushing the emotions away, she focused on the task at had. Letting them distract her would only get herself and possbibly Norel killed, though she really hope he had a fallback plan for such an occasion.
Not wasting any more time, she cuts a neat hole into the roof of the lift itself and with a surge of Force makes a leap up and through the hole. Clipping her lightsaber to her belt she makes another jump to the ladder. With her grip secured she works her way up to the roof as quickly as she’s able.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

OK..... here goes.
***Surge* Use the Force** +11 (using a FP to increase my range by +10 and speed by 2)
***19*** <- [8] 1d20 + 11
**Jump** +11
***29*** <- [18] 1d20 + 11
DC 48 for jumping out; Got a 49 (20 from Surge + Jump check)
**Climb** +6 (in the event you want one for catching the rungs of the ladder.)
***11*** <- [5] 1d20 + 6
I’m going to accelerate climb as a full-round action to move my full speed (not sure what sort of climb checks you want, but as I’m assuming there’s a ladder of some sort inside the tube that it’s not a hard climb. Assumung that the lift was halfway down when I jumped out say at level 5 then I have to climb (5 floors * 4m = 20m) for two rounds. This is assuming of course I can't use the 4 squares remaining to me after jumping onto the lift.
My plan for once on the roof:
Getting through the hatch of course.
Disabling the lifts, hopefully they’ve taken her ruse and will try to intercept her on the first level which will occupy them long enough to get all this done. I want to concentrate on getting the lift I didn’t use not working first and then the one I welded shut.
Use Norel’s private lift to rendezvous with him.

"***Get her!***" the squad leader shouts as Marina ducks back through the closing doors.
The sound of the stormtroopers' pursuit fades she travels several floors down and enacts her escape plan. With speed only a trained Jedi could acheive, she reaches the top of the turbolift chamber swiftly and discovers a small landing where maintenance crews or service droids could work. The roof's access panel is shut and locked. The lift control panel is nearby, but as Marina watches it begins to blink with the steady red pattern that indicates the building has just entered some sort of lockdown. It's only a moment later when the sounds of security klaxons can be heard echoing up the empty lift shaft.
Her bracer alerts her to all manner of priority communications channels being used, suddenly streaming one conversation in real-time:
"**Find her! Find them *both* or it's Kessel for the lot of you!**"
"**Yes sir, Commander Chayse!**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

So I'm not going to worry too much about the **Climb** rolls since it's reasonable to include things like piping and conduits all along the shaft and because Marina could have used opposite/adjacent sides to "pressure climb" in the corners, effectively reducing the DC to negligable. Plus - who wants to roll for climbing at a moment like this? The electronic lock is Mechanics DC20, the lift controls are "*hostile*" right now (Will Defense of 20). The door is a metal door (p.151, core).

A mischievous grin crosses the young Jedi’s expression as the peeved voice of Chayse comes through over the tapped comm lines. Glancing down over the edge of the maintence platform she makes sure they haven’t yet made their way into the shaft. Satisfied for the moment she turns her attention to the lift’s control panel. Extending the connector on her bracer she plugs it into the port of the panel and gets to work. It takes only a short while for her to subdue the lift’s programming. Inserting the necessary commands, she completely locks out access to everyone but her. Wondering if the Imperials had made it into the lift she sealed shut, she checks to see if there’s any sort of sensors. If there is, she disables access from everywhere but the panel and her bracer computer.
Satisfied of her control of the systems she proceeds to opening the hatch and gaining access to the roof. After disabling the security measures on the hatch, she draws her blaster. Popping the hatch open slightly she takes a cursory look out onto the roof, using her Jedi enhances senses to make sure she wasn’t setting herself up into an ambush.

With the turbolift lockdown now turned on them, the Imperial soldiers waste no time in setting checkpoints at all the entrances and exits while simultaneously engaging in a floor-by-floor search for the missing Jedi tech. Fusion cutters would take a few minutes to breach the sealed lift doors though, plenty of time to make it out and across the roof of the building.
Marina peers out, using the Force to aid in detection, and discovers a lone figure standing directly in the path to Norel's private lift. About 15 meters away, his hulking mass leans against an enormous bone spear. The wind ripples through his thick brown fur but his large frame remains motionless. His gleaming tusks leave no doubt - Whiphid physiology is not easily mistaken. His dark eyes set resolutely on Marina, and he begins to speak in slow, rumbling Basic:
"**There are no Imperials here, Jedi female. Only B'Dub… and I am not easily eluded.**" he grasps the spear in both hands and points it towards Marina, "**You're journey is over.**"
A number of drones identical to B3-D3 descend around the the rooftop, optics fixed on Marina's location.

I struggled with how to depict this scene and, to be honest, I could continue working on it forever. I think it's better to keep things moving though, and I'm itching for some lightsaber action. No, you're not *officially* in combat yet - you're welcome to try something else if you like. Include an Initiative roll when you're ready, and understand that he may just attack you at some point anyway. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

Realizing she wasn’t going to be able to avoid the confrontation easily, Marina steps out fully onto the rooftop. The young Jedi takes in the scene with mild amusement and growing sense of determination. Grasping her blaster pistol tightly in one hand, she suddenly finds the feel of the grip wholly inadequate.
“**So you’re the one who’s been spying on me, curious how you were able to pick me out of the thousands who must make their way here each day,**” Marina says, eyeing the hovering droids moving about her. From working on BD she had an idea of their capabilities, assuming of course they were all built the same. Her attention doesn’t linger on them long, just a split second.
“**I don’t wish to fight you,**” Marina says warily. Cocking her head to the side, she reaches out with the Force to nudge her opponent’s thoughts. “**Forget you saw me here and go on your way.** Subtly as she speaks she changes the setting of her blaster pistol to the ion setting.

B'Dub stares at her for a moment, clearly trying to fight her influence. Ultimately he caves though, and his countenance changes completely. He mutters something about a mistake and begins to wander back towards the edge of the roof. Before proceeding, Marina takes the time to reach out and sense Jedi Knight Joran Nor's presence - whether he is even still in the building or not. His airspeeder lies parked in its spot near his lift, with J3 sitting motionless in the driver's position, but that could mean anything. The drones continue to surround her but seem agitated that their Whiphid master has abandoned pursuit. They glance in his direction intermittently.
The young Jedi succeeds in finding Joran - he's in his office, only a short sprint away. Marina is not surprised to get the impression that he's worried but is glad he doesn't seem to be injured in any way.
One of the drones breaks rank and floats over to B'Dub, chirping out Binary pleas for instructions. The others hover steadily just out of reach for Marina. It appears to further disorient the Whiphid at first but then switches to speaking in his native tongue. His confused looks starts to turn to anger.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Use the Force** made in chat, with a **24** result.
B'Dub has moved to the far right edge of the roof but I'm not going to start going into a geometry lesson about how far away he is. It's a shorter distance to the lift than it is to him. If it helps to imagine some sort of roofing equipment in the way then you can do that.

It was becoming quickly evident that Marina’s mind trick wasn’t going to last for long, she was going to have to act quickly if she was going to enact a plan to get she and Norel both away. Or if nothing else, give Norel his chance.
Sprinting toward the airspeeder, she taps on the transparisteel window opposite the droid, before jumping into the back and cutting off any vocal admonishments the valet may have. “**There’s no time. You need to listen or we won’t be able to help Norel.**” Glancing back briefly to check on the Whipid’s progress in remembering she continues her instructions. Her anxiousness increasing as the bounty hunter got increasingly angrier“**I need you to fly over the side of the building and stay as level and as close as you can to Norel’s office window. You need to give him a chance to jump to safety before you high tail it out of here. I’m sure Norel will have some instructions at the point.**” She eyes the droid briefly.
“**Got it? Good. No time to waste,**” the young Jedi says, not really waiting for the droid to answer her question. Jumping back out of the speeder she turns to face the Whipid she tried to trick with brief success. Unclipping her saber, she keeps in unignited at her side, her blaster pistol still set on its ion mode at her other side.

"**Oh! Miss-**" J3 begins, startled by Marina's sudden presence and instructions. He listens intently as she lays out her plan. While he doesn't follow her reasoning, a quick scan of security protocols currently in place indicate potential danger for his master and that's all the excuse he needs to move. The young Jedi leaps from the airspeeder as the droid begins the takeoff cycle. The engines whine to life and the vessel lifts a few meters in the air.
Across the rooftop B'Dub shakes his head and tries to clear his mind - certainly this wasn't who he was looking for? The drone continues its pleas though and eventually meets with a measure of success. The Whiphid bounty hunter swats angrily at the tiny droid and starts to lumber towards Marina, still confused and growling something in his native language. The drones form up behind him and follow at a distance with optics trained on the Jedi.
She gets a sudden mental impression from the Jedi Knight: *Danger here!* The accompanying emotions could just as well make it a warning as an urgent request for aid. Whichever it is, J3 is nearly out of range and on his way towards the office window.

You're looking at B'Dub 7 spaces away, surrounded by 5 hovering drones like B3-D3 (well, like he *was*) advancing on your position. J3 will be fully underway on the next turn so if you want to make a quick retreat back into the speeder or onto it's roof or something that's possible. And, frankly, probably way cooler at this point than bothering with B'Dub - just my opinion. Maybe some parting words or a shot at one of the droids or something? I dunno. You could probably take him... but at what cost, Alicia... what *cost?*

Marina watches B’dur warily for a long moment then decides that a confrontation with the Whipid would have to wait. Her decision is confirmed as she receives the telepathic message from her Jedi compatriot. Not wasting much more time she back pedals towards the speeder, and shoots the Whipid a smile. “**Guess we’ll have to finish our negotiations later**,” she says. “**It would have been very interesting working on your droids.**”
Moments before the valet lifts the speeder off the roof, she jumps back into the front seat of the vehicle. Still keeping an eye on the Whipid, particularly his droids to make sure they didn’t try to pull something, she settles in for the soon to be rough ride.
Reaching out in the Force, she touches Norel’s thoughts much as he had before. In comparison her emotions are calmer, focused, though a touch of the excitement from the thrill of the adventure she was having escapes through. It had been awhile since she’d had to use her Jedi honed abilities and she found it strangely thrilling. *Be ready… Jump* she says through the connection and keeps her blaster in hand to be ready to cover him when needed through the open door of the speeder.

B'Dub picks up steam and runs to meet Marina but narrowly misses her as she leaps into the airspeeder and is lifted just out of reach. He bellows threats at her but it's too late - she has escaped. Whiphids aren't known for their jumping ability and B'Dub retreats from the roof's edge for now.
J3 pulls the airspeeder around the side of the building and descends to just outside Norel's office window. They arrive just in time as he's clearly engaged in some heavy fighting of his own. Half a dozen Stormtroopers lay dead at his feet with more entering the room. A Jedi Knight is rarely outnumbered by such foes but the cramped spaces make things difficult and Norel is glad to have the backup. His bright green saber deflects another flurry of blaster fire and he backs towards the window, levitating one of the fallen soldiers with the Force. The glass shatters as the body is thrown violently out of the office and falls to the street far below. Norel hurls his large desk at the only doorway with the same skill. It's enough to block the oncoming Imperials for a few moments and he takes the opportunity to deactivate his saber and throw himself out into the airspeeder. A few poorly-aimed bolts fly past the trio as they rise out of danger and J3 waits for further instructions.
"**Well,**" says Norel, addressing Marina as more of a comrade than just a friend, "**That was interesting.**"
He rights himself in the seat and straightens his collar a bit, then speaks to J3:
"**J3 - take us to *The Nova*.**"
The airspeeder lurches to the side as the droid pilot changes direction. Upper Tyrena is host to a whole culture that would seem out of place in all the locations Marina's visited so far, but as they make their way to Norel's private ship she is faced once again with the nature of a nomad's life. This time, though, she's in good company.

Marina gives the older Jedi a mischievous grin before looking out the back window for possible pursuit. “**I don’t think Commander Chayse is having a very good day,**” she says cheerily. “**Though I’ve really pissed off the bounty hunter sent after me.**” Checking her bracer she keeps an eye out for any transmissions that might prove useful. They were bound to send pursuit after all.
Looking back to Norel the young Jedi frowns for a moment. “**Do you think Kitkkata will be alright?**” A part of her didn’t feel right leaving the youngling behind, but she doubted they had to time to find her.
Nearing the landing pad in Upper Tyrena the grim reality that she couldn’t even manage to stay out of trouble for a day made her doubt her ability to survive. Maybe it was time she found somewhere to hole up till it was safer. *At least long enough to make it back to…*  she stops herself. Whether trepidation her thoughts might betray her or the hope ended up being unbearable, something stops her from even thinking the name of the planet she had once thought to call home. *Well I’ll cross that bridge when the time comes.*
Drawing near the ship, the mechanic takes a good look over the outside of the ship they were to flee in -*Hopefully, it’s faster than it looks*- and recounts everything she can about the class. “**I don’t know if I’m leaving Corellia better off than I arrived, but at least I can say it’s been interesting,**” she says quietly with a grin to Norel.

"**What do you mean they *escaped*? Are you saying a *platoon* of the Empire's best couldn't handle *two Jedi*?!**"
"**Yes sir, well, no sir. We're scrambling some fighters right now to intercept.**"
"**You *better* be, ensign. You better scramble your fighters and you better hope you find them because if you don't…!**"
It's a safe bet that Commander Chayse won't let his subordinates forget this failure, and that Marina and Norel can expect company soon. J3 pulls the airspeeder in and out of different alleys in an attempt to avoid a determinable destination but not at the expense of time.
"**Oh, I think Kitkkata will be just fine,**" replies Norel with a smirk. He acknowledges her comment about leaving but says no more during the flight and the two Jedi scan their respective vectors for incoming Imperials. Eventually they reach the landing platform high above the streets of Upper Tyrena where Norel's vessel is parked.
The *Nova* is a pristine Corellian Engineering Corporation HWK-290 transport, standing out even among much larger and grander ships. It's gleaming steel hull is accented with tasteful green highlights on the wingtips and fuselage. A bright red crest resembling a sun - but clearly a subtle reference to the Galactic Republic's emblem - marks the hull just forward of the wings. The loading ramp is already down and J3 circles the platform once.
"**It's been a pleasure sir, take care of yourself!**" he says, swooping the craft low to the landing pad. Norel rests a hand on the droid's shoulder. "**Be safe, J3, and thank you!**" The Jedi Knight then turns to Marina:
"**Let's go!**" he shouts, opening the side door and leaping out onto the platform below. She follows suit and the two sprint up into the waiting ship. Norel hurries to the pilot's chair to finish the takeoff cycle, the ship's engines oddly quiet throughout the whole process. It only takes a few moments and as the *Nova* lifts into the air and prepares to break atmosphere Marina can see J3's airspeeder disappearing into the horizon - followed closely by a pair of Imperial fighters. Norel glances out as well but only briefly, exhaling deeply. His eyes return to the blue sky ahead, already fading to the star-crowded background of deep space.
"**We should be all set to make a micro-jump in a few seconds, you may want to brace yourself.**"<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

Commander Chayse strolls the hallway to Norel Jax's office and begins to realize the weight of what has just transpired. Not only one but *two* Jedi survivors had just escaped the very building he and thirty Stormtroopers under his direct command had been occupying. He had already spoken with that Whiphid bounty hunter about suspending his pay until they'd both been caught. Surprisingly he had agreed, though Chayse wasn't sure why. Perhaps he was still out of sorts from the encounter with that Jedi girl.
The girl - Marina Cloudspinner. At least that's what she'd *called* herself. Good Imperial Commanders didn't trust Jedi to give them anything, much less a real name, and Byron Chayse wasn't just good - he was the best. His people were working hard to find out her real identity and when they did he would find her. If he couldn't find her, he'd find someone close. Then all he had to do was wait. Good Imperial Commanders were patient, and Byron Chayse was the best.<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

The *Nova* emerged from its jump on the edge of the Correllian system. Joran Nor got up from his seat slowly and beckoned for Marina to follow him into the interior of the ship. They passed several panels that indicated some serious modifications had been made to the vessel but their nature wasn't readily apparent. Much of the cargo space had been sacrificed for whatever additional systems had been installed but there were a few bunkrooms, a common area, and a fresher that one would ordinarily expect aboard such a transport. Near the engine room was a fully furnished workshop - something that any "techie" would find a comfort, even moreso one who preferred working with droids. Upon reaching this feature Joran turns to Marina:
"**We may be traveling for a while. Until I can figure out what our next move is I'd appreciate you girls playing nice.**" he says, cracking a smile and opening the engine room hatch. There, sitting in the center of the floor and rummaging through Marina's duffel bag is the Wookie Kitkkata. She looks up, caught red-handed, and chuckles sheepishly.

Phew! That was way longer than I thought it'd be. I included that middle section instead of putting it in the Peripherals for the sake of flow. Give Marina 1000XP for *not* fighting B'Dub. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

### **Alicia** (2011-12-16 11:42:53)

Marina eyes the HWK-290 critically. The gleaming hull of the upscale cargo ship made her wonder if it had even lifted off into the depths of space, but she doubted Norel, wait Joran would favor impracticability. If anything she new the ship was supposed to be fast, but had little in the way of fire power. Hopefully they would be able to outrun any of the ships the Empire more specifically Chayse sent after them.
Giving the droid a nod, follows Jorel out of the speeder moments before it lifts off to lead the squadron of stub fighters from their position. Without hesitation she comtinues up the ramp, but at the top she pauses, hitting the controls that would raise it and close out the world of Corellia. In the distance J3’s speeder disappears pursued by the Imperials. Turning away from the site she makes her way to the bridge, only glancing intermittently at the array of modifications Joran had made to the freighter. Taking a seat in the copliot’s chair she glances over the systems before bracing herself for the short jump. Her stomach knotted with the short jump the stars elongating for a long moment before they returned to normal space. Such a short jump could put enormous strain on the hyperdrive engine, she made a note to give it a look over before they tried it again.
The young Jedi’s thoughts are interrupted as Joran beckoned her to follow. As he leads her through the interior she takes more careful note of the strange systems and her practiced eye finally registers what they are, sequipment to avoid detection. Continuing along, she’s pleased to see the workshop knowing full well she’d probably find herself making full use of those facilities.
When Joran opens the hatch to the engine compartment, she perhaps shouldn’t have been so surprised to find the Wookie youngling aboard. More surprising was the fact Kitkkata had her duffel she had left inconviently in her room. *When did they have the time to get that?* she wonders briefly. Giving Joran a confused glance she asks, "**When… how?**" Approaching the young Wookie she pulls out a bar of sweets she had been saving and hands it over. “**Call that an apology for scaring you yesterday,**” she says with a smirk. “**And don’t go looking for anymore, that’s my last one.**” With the Wookie busy with the candy bar, Marina puts everything back into her duffel.

"**One doesn't let Imperial officers lodge in one's hotel without first making sure one has… less traditional passageways available. Once I realized what was going on I had Kitkkata try and alert you - clearly you had the same idea.**" replies Norel. "**Anyway, I'll be up front if anybody needs me. The job I had planned may or may not still be available, depending on how soon our friend Commander Chayse wants to admit his inability to capture two little Jedi…**" he winks and heads back towards the cockpit of the *Nova*.
The appearance of a treat causes Kitkkata to lose all interest in Marina's belongings and she begins to devour it hastily. It gives Marina plenty of time to gather everything together and re-pack her duffel bag. A further inspection of the additional systems crammed inside the HWK-290's hull reveals an array of stealth and speed-oriented equipment. Both the sublight engines and the hyperdrive seem to have been modified significantly, but what was probably once a very spacious vessel is now considerably tighter quarters. The payoff was probably worth it though, and it doesn't take a full report for Marina to imagine the *Nova* is more than capable of avoiding, or out-running, Imperial detection for some time.

Content everything was back in her bag, Marina stands from where she crouches next to the Wookie youngling. Pulling out the data package, the young Jedi heads back out of the engine room and makes her way to the workbench. After tossing her duffel down next to it, she pulls from within her pouch the small remote B3-D3. “**It’s time I started entering your programming,**” she says matter of factly to the small droid. Starting with installing the Shriiwook language package, Marina works diligently for a few hours entering the relevant programming for the droid’s new task as her assistant. If Kitkkata shows interest, the young mechanic lets the youngling assist her, hopefully aided by the new language package installed on B3.

Reprogramming takes 3. 5 hours. The task an automatic success based on my skill mod. It would take only a half hour for the language package to be installed so make of that what you may.

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-21 16:22:14)

Kitkkata finishes the last few bites of the treat and watches Marina closely. Curiousity is her downfall and once the little droid finally starts its diagnostics in Shyriiwook she runs over to the workbench quickly. Marina's earbud allows a real-time translation of the conversation:
<*New language module installed…beginning systems check…*>
"**Oh yay! Another friend!**"*
<**Native speaker present…nuance analysis subroutine initiated…resuming primary operational mode…**>
"**Hmmm… You sound weird.**"*
The drone suddenly lifts into the air, its repulsor motivators humming to life. B3 floats about the immediate area in quick, unpredictable movements. It scans various things at random, taking in its surroundings and chirping out its findings in rapid strings of Binary too fast for Marina to understand without translation:
<**Lifeform = human female // hull = durasteel plating // tool = hydrospanner…**>
Kitkkata is confused by the droid's behavior at first, but then begins to chuckle - at which B3 immediately moves to hover just within arms reach of the Wookie youngling:
"**So…what are you, like a baby droid or something?**"*
<**B3-D3 = Marksman-H Combat Remote Droid // You = ?**>
"**I'm a Wookie, silly! I'm seven years old and my name's Kitkkata - it means '*swift child*' because I got away from *Imperial* soldiers.**"* she replies proudly.
<**B3 = charmed**>
The tiny drone then turns itself to face Marina and displays the same erratic behavior, scanning her from all sides before addressing her in Binary:
<**You = ?**>

Marina listens to the exchange with amusement. Pleased that the translation matrix was working appropriately the binary automatically being translated to her earbud.and she could now communicate fully with the young Wookiee using B3 as the proxy. As the droid’s attention turn to her she responds to the inquiry, “**I’m Marina, your programmer and master. You’re function will be to assist me in maintenance and analysis. Are you ready for further programming?**” Holding out her hand she beckons the small droid to come to her.
<**B3 = ready // Master = complete programming** >
Once the droid begins to comply she glances over at Kit and gives her a smile. “**You seem to have a knack with machines yourself, would you like to help?**”

Not as long as I would have liked. Guess it will do.. Assume unless something else happens the next few hours consist of finishing the programming and idle chit chat between Kit and Marina... Marina would mainly want to know how Kit had found herself on her own, find Joran, etc.

Kitkkata's eyes light up at Marina's offer and she nods her head eagerly in the affirmative.
"**Oh I do! I mean, I would!**"
The time passes quickly as the pair bond over the work before them. Kitkkata - *Kit*, as she prefers to be called - is young but talented and curious to learn as much as she can about the inner workings of the little droid. She asks countless questions, a trait typical to children of all species. They develop a good teacher-student dynamic and are soon conversing about things less technical.
"**…on Kashyyyk. That's where I was born, you know. My Papa fought the droids in the Clone Wars when I was really little, and he says '*There's no such thing as a good droid*' but I don't think that's true anymore.**" She goes quiet for a few moments, her longing for home apparent. "**Someday I'll get to go back, but not yet. Mr. Jax says it's too dangerous.**" Kit's attitude quickly shifts back to the positive though, another sign of her youth and short attention span. "**He let me work on his ship though, and I got to live in a *secret tunnel* too - but you already knew that part.**" she rolls her eyes. "**It's old, you know, some of the parts. I can tell. Mr. Jax calls it *syke*… something. When I hold something I can learn things about it.**"

Listening attentively as the two of them worked on entering the final bits of programming on B3, Marina was amazed at the ingenuity and perseverance the young girl had to be able to survive on her own. The young Jedi was also saddened as it would probably be a long time before the Wookies would be able to take back their world from the Empire’s grasp. If they weren’t all slaves or extinct first.
Starting a backup of the droid’s programming, Marina turns her attention to the youngling. “**You mean Psychometry? That’s a rare gift; to be able to read the history of an object. I’m able to do something similar. I can touch a computer or a droid and access some of their memories, or just mess with them outright.**” Curiosity getting the better of her, she holds the droid out for Kit to take hold of. “**What can you tell me about B3’s past?**”

## Re: Bit By Bit (Marina Numa's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-30 22:10:00)

The Wookie youngling reaches hesitantly for the offered droid, not wanting to embarrass herself in front of her new friend so soon. She holds B3 gently and concentrates hard. Nothing happens for a few moments, but then a dim vision takes form in her mind's eye.
"**I can see someone big and mean… He's hairy, like my Papa, but he's got… long teeth? It's dark and he's standing over somebody else… they're hurt. He's saying something…**" Kit listens intently, discerning the words and repeating them slowly to Marina: **"'*Your journey is over.*'**"
The scene then flashes through dozens more like it, helpless figures hewn down where they lay. Always in darkness though - a sign of Kit's novice grasp of her powers. She can't prevent the sudden barrage of violence and yelps out in terror. Her eyes go wide and she drops B3 nearly to the floor. The little droid's safety mechanisms activate its repulsors just in time to save it from crashing to the deck. It whirs and beeps and returns to Marina's hands, but Kit staggers back a few steps and stares at her handsin horror. Shouting hysterically, she looks at Marina with eyes pleading for clarity and comfort:
"**He killed them! He killed them *all!***"

Marina watches the youngling, keeping quiet and waiting as Kit attempts to control her fledgling ability. The young Jedi is pleased for Kit as she’s able to harness it and the vision takes over.
At first Marina is pleased that B3’s origins are confirmed, but then as Kit begins to see the myriad of darker images of violence regret begins to course through her for what she’d just put her youngling friend through. No child should have to see that.
Quickly setting the droid aside, Marina places her hands in the young Wookie’s so she didn’t have to look at just them. It’s an opening for the youngling to come closer should she want more comfort. “**I’m sorry, Kit,**” she says inadequately. “**B3 once belonged to a bounty hunter, a Whipid called B’Dub. We’re far away from him now and so he won’t be able to hurt any of us.**” She could only hope her words were enough to comfort the young girl.

Kit welcomes the offered hands and wraps her little furry arms around Marina in the sort of child's embrace that few could refuse. She doesn't cry, but the vision had obviously been unexpected. For someone who boasts of having escaped Imperial soldiers, she still carries the burden of an entire race being violently enslaved. It's a lot for her seven years to process. Joran - having heard the shout from up front - appears around the corner. His eyes meet Marina's and he realizes whatever had transpired is now well in hand. After a few quiet moments, he begins to speak softly. The information is important and if it can serve as a distraction for Kit - all the better.
"**We have some choices to make. Chayse hasn't publicly acknowledged what happened but that only means he'll be working harder to rectify his mistake. And there's your bounty hunter to consider as well. I have a contact on Tatooine that may be able to help us as far as a place to lay low and re-group. He's trustworthy and I think we'd be able to blend in fairly well, though Kit would have to be careful. So that's one option.**"
Joran shifts his weight with the look of someone unwilling to make a tough decision on his own, at least not without consulting the others.
"**There's another possible destination: a shadowport called Nadir. I managed to acquire some coordinates a while back as a result of some… business dealings,**" his pause is deliberate, but he continues before any questions can be asked, "**…and I'm sure we could avoid Imperial detection there. Of course that's probably all we'd avoid, but it's a possibility. I don't think we'd be able to stay too long without paying more than credits, but I have enough to buy us a couple weeks I think. If you've got any ideas, Marina, I'm open to suggestions.**"

Holding the Wookie child in her arms, Marina's own heart began to ache for the last child she had held there. Caressing the soft fur Marina hoped it was reassuring and comforting to the distraught Wookie. Her eyes meet Joran's and the young Jedi hopes he doesn't see the longing for her own child.
When Joran starts to speak softly Marina pulls back slowly from Kit, but stays close to remain a reassuring presence. Her heart races as Joran asks her if she has any suggestions. Maybe her chance had come to finally return... Well home
"**I do actually, but only if there's aaurances we won't be followed there.**" she says slowly. She'd be damned if she led anyone there that would ruin her sanctuary.

Marina nods and with some reluctance lays out her idea. “**There’s a planet on the border into the Unknown Regions. It’s hidden and relatively forgotten by the rest of the galaxy.** She lets out a heavy breath, one she didn’t know she’d been holding. The secret or at least part was just shared. A part of her hoped this was the right thing and another was apprehensive. There was a lot on the line. After all they could go anywhere else to hide. Tattooine was as good an option as any. ”**It’s a good place to hide or start over; at least we’d be welcome there without having to hide who we are.**”

Jedi Knight Joran Nor knows when to press an issue and when to back off, and Marina's sending all the signals for the latter. A place to escape permanently, or even semi-permanently could be useful for more than just the *Nova*'s crew and he makes it a point to ask for details later.
"**Hidden and forgotten - exactly what we're shooting for, I'd say. But perhaps we should make that stop in Mos Eisley first anyway and see if we can manage more in the way of supplies. I wouldn't mind another identity or two for each of us - it'd make traveling much easier. And maybe we can get a bead on what Chayse is up to as well.**" Joran's thoughts drift for a moment as he ponders the possibilities ahead, and then: "**Okay. Tatooine it is - unless anyone has any objections?**"
Kitkkata shrugs her shoulders, resigned to wherever the two Humans decide - it's not like she has anywhere else to go.

The young Jedi knows Joran isn’t going to leave getting more information about Iruji to just this discussion. Sooner or later he would make a point about getting details and she guesses it’s going to be sooner. *Am I ready for this?* she asks silently. Her deepest wish after all is to return. *But not at the expense of revealing what should stay hidden.* Marina turns away from Joran and his probing gaze, also resigned to where the older Jedi was to take them.
Instead the mechanic decides to change the topic. “**Kit, it seems you have the advantage of knowing this ship better than me. Why don’t you show me around.**” Using the Wookie’s youthful enthusiasm, Marina hopes to avoid Joran’s questions for awhile longer. A delay, she knows, but a welcome one till she can collect her thoughts more.

"**Okay! This is the workshop, of course, and back there is the engine room. Mr. Jax had me work on those first - they're much faster now. You've probably already seen where we sleep, but that's towards the middle of the ship. The beds are small but I don't mind - and I'm allowed to decorate *my* room as much as I like.**" Kit says the last sentence with the pride of any child in her artwork, and Marina peeks in to see all manner of sculptures and mobiles hanging from nearly every surface. They're comprised mostly of whatever bits of metal or parts one would expect to be available to someone living in such circumstances as the young Wookie is.
The guided tour continues through the crowded ship uninterrupted. Kitkkata is quite proud of the work since she either helped or worked alone of most of it. She explains how her father was a mechanic on some of the Wookie craft used in the Clone Wars and how she used to watch him all the time. How much of her explanations are true is largely left to Marina to decide. She points out major systems that are not only expensive but illegal and it becomes all the more apparent that Joran Nor has been preparing for this day for quite sometime. The trade-off is clear: amazing capabilities for crowded living space and general aesthetics on the interior, though from the outside it looks like a well-kept vessel belonging to a fairly wealthy hotel manager. In summary - there's more to the *Nova* than meets the eye. The same could be said about her crew.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Sorry for the light conversation, but I think it's better this way. You can end in the cockpit if you like, but you have the opportunity to chat with Kit about bunking or other features if you like. I'm ruling that there are three bunkrooms, each with a double bunk. Small, but each has a fresher and there's foot locker for each occupant. Other than that, Marina would easily learn the following systems are present:
* Sensor Baffling [0pts]
* Sensor Mask[1pt]
* Sublight engines replaced[7pts]
* Workshop[1pt]
* Sublight drive (3 squares) [4pts] replaced to gain a total of 7pts. Then a Sublight drive (6 squares) [7pts] was installed
* Jamming Array[5pts]
* Shields, SR200[10pts]
* Navicomputer[1pt] replaced with an advanced model[2pts]
* Cloaking device, hibridium[3pts]
* Holonet transceiver[4pts]
* Transponder, disguised 1[0pts]
* Sensor array computer +6[3pts]
* Sensor enhancement package[1pt]
* 15 tons (3pts) leftover
[/list:u:3amwkzd6]
Notes: 5tons of cargo = 1 emplacement point for a Colossal transport, so the Nova has 150 tons = 30 points. I kept the x2 hyperdrive since the Starships book seems to indicate that's pretty state-of-art for our era. It's not heavily armed, but I think you could manage to escape just about anyone with some decent flying - and that's if they even found you in the first place. I don't plan on any ship combat soon anyway, so most of this is fuel for my "GM's discretion" about stuff. If jaybee ends up joining I'm sure he's going to bring along Sera. Ya'll can figure out bunking at that point. I'm also ruling that Joran has his own (very small) quarters near the cockpit.

Following along, Marina pretends to give the child her apt attention, but as she’s already seen most of the ship. Having been on a great deal of them she has a good inkling of what should be where. She takes the liberty of claiming one of the rooms, picking the one that doesn’t seem to have found any occupancy yet. Used to the close quarters, the double bunks don’t seem to bother her, though she idly wonders if she was ever going to have roommate.
Storing her stuff, she follows Kit back out into the engine room and takes a closer look at every single console and upgrade that Joran had placed on his ship. Her route takes her to the cockpit, where she finds Joran. He was either the most comfortable there, or he just liked running a tight ship. Maybe both.
Plopping down into the copilot’s seat she takes a long moment to examine the controls, delaying meeting the older Knights gaze. “**There’s some things I can’t talk about. Especially about… Iruji,**” she says, spitting out the planet’s name after a brief hesitation. “**It’s a difficult topic for me. I’ve been keeping it a secret for too long and such things become difficult to share.**” Risking a look up, she meets Joran’s gaze. This was something she was just going to have to face now. It wasn’t a secret she could keep for much longer, especially if they were going to head there. “**There’s too many lives at risk if we mess this up.**”

Marina enters the cockpit as Joran Nor is finishing up a message on the ship's long-range communications display: "**…it'll be good to see you again too, Master. Joran out.**"
After listening quietly to the young Jedi, he addresses her obvious concerns before explaining the overall plan as it stands:
"**No one's pressing the matter, and we all have secrets to bear - but they needn't be burdens. Be mindful that your well-placed concern doesn't end up turning to fear. You're among friends now. Besides - we have plenty of time before we get there. We'll be making the jump to Tatooine in a few minutes and landing outside of Mos Eisley. It's a safe area, and mostly deserted. It'll be after sunset when we arrive which should help mask our approach, but I'm sure you've noticed some of the 'special features' *Nova* has by now.**" He smiles, glad to have someone with both technical know-how *and* battle experience aboard. Kitkkata is certainly gifted, but Joran had spent a considerable amount of credits on the ship all the same. "**My contact is meeting us there and he'll be able to better explain our next steps. I may need you to venture into the spaceport itself for some supplies, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.**"
Joran waits to see if Marina has anything further to add before signaling Kit for the jump to lightspeed.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Since you and jaybee haven't ever synched up timelines, we'll roll RAW to see how long the trip takes. Even if there's nothing much that happens, it'll be good to set that precedent. I used RAW with Surge, so it makes sense for now. At first I didn't like it, but now I kind of do. It leaves a little bit of mystery, which is as it should be.
**Hyperdrive x2**

The young Jedi knows Joran is right about one thing. Her concern for keeping the secret, of not being the one to reveal Iruji's existence to the galaxy, was bordering on fear. Maybe the Jedi was right to prohibit their members from having families. It added far too many complications to a life dedicated to serving the Republic. But now the Republic was gone and Marina now had the chance to come to terms with the fact that she had another family, one related to her by blood, she could turn to.
This the young woman mulls over while Joran makes the jump into lightspeed. Checking the counter she sees they have eight days till they reach Tatooine. Her thoughts began drifting to the last time she was there as she watches the stars blur past. “**I was born on Tatooine,**” Marina blurted, nearly startling herself with the outburst. Yet she continues, “**In Mos Espa.**”

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-04 11:25:50)

Sensitive to the mood now present in the cockpit, Joran is content to allow Marina to continue at her own pace:
"**Is that right? I was born on Coruscant - quite a different planet. Less sand, more noise.**" His words are said playfully - an attempt to keep things from getting too somber but not prohibiting further conversation.
It was true that most of his life was spent among Jedi, until Order 66, and that Joran knew little else until the rise of Palpatine. His fellow Jedi Knights had indeed scattered across the galaxy but many had fallen under the Empire's relentless pursuit. Taking alternate identities seemed the only remaining solution. They all knew it wouldn't last forever and he was glad to have stayed hidden this long. It felt good to have a ship, and a crew, with which to bring the fight to the Imperials in some capacity.

"**And cold,**" Marina adds to his list. "**I've never liked the cold. People say children adapt quickly, but it took me years to get used it.**" Leaning against the consoles she continues to look out. "**I trained there as a youngling. To think the Temple is probably just a pile of rubble now.**" Order gone, temple destroyed, and the archive meeting the same fate if not in the self proclaimed Emperor's hands. Over a thousand years of history lost to the ages.
Marina sits up and blinks, letting the thoughts run their course before letting them go. The only thing to do now was to survive, attempt to preserve what was left, and pass on their knowledge to the next generation. That was probably going to be the only way the Jedi would be able to come back. "**Your contact on Tatooine, he's a Jedi? One of the ones that went into hiding during the war?**"

"**Yes, a Master in fact. Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. He escaped Order 66 after killing General Grievous on Utapau. He fled to Tatooine but we've been able to keep in touch occasionally. Anytime Jedi attempt communication with each other it's twice as dangerous - as I'm sure you've discovered by now - but it helps to know there are others out there, keeping the Order alive. It's more than a just a temple, and I'm sure it will survive much longer than we will.**"
The last sentence comes out darker than Joran had intended. The Jedi were indeed near extinction but this was not the first time such a thing had happened in the galaxy. The tides are always turned by small groups of like-minded individuals with the unique mix of determination and self-preservation. The *Nova* had more than one such person within its care at the moment.
"**Eight days?**" exclaims Kitkkata, entering the cockpit area with B3 in tow. "**That's a really long time…**" she says, walking over to Joran who's still in the pilot's seat. "**Wanna teach me some more Force things?**"
The Jedi Knight laughs at the welcome interruption, and the eager pupil it brings.
"**Me? Oh, I think I've taught you everything I can for now!**" he jests, "**Why don't you ask Marina though - she may know a few things I dont…**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, this is just an option. If you're not up to it you can always suggest something else in-game. Teaching/mentoring Kit would be some combination of UtF and maybe Perception skills and Int, Wis, or Cha ability checks. That's a broad selection simply because it depends on the nature of what is being taught and how. We'll assume Kit has a training lightsaber if necessary.

## Re: Bit By Bit (Marina Numa's Story)

### **Alicia** (2012-01-04 17:08:03)

“**Master Kenobi survived?**” Marina asks, taken aback for a moment. She had thought the council members would have been the first to have been executed. Or course if they didn’t catch him unawares it would have taken extreme numbers to bring down a Master of the council. Her thoughts are interrupted as Kit comes bounding in, B3 hovering close behind.
Marina gives Joran a cursory glance, before turning her attention to the young Wookie and giving her a smile. Having never really thought about how she would handle a pupil of her own, she wondered for a moment was would be appropriate to teach a child of Kit’s age. Probably just the basics, she was still young and had never had the benefit of Temple training. Then again Joran had probably covered most of it. “**Sure, Kit… I can teach you some things, but they’ll take a lot of work to master.**” Standing up from the copilot’s chair she leaves Joran to do whatever he got up to in the cramped cockpit.
Over the next week, Marina makes good use of the limitied space of the cargo, the largest space available for what she wanted to teach the youngling. She doesn’t teach her anything having to do with the lightsaber, but instead shows her a way to center herself using the motions of her body through a series of martial katas. The endeavor took her back to when Firith Ven had taught them to her. They had served to tire her more than anything at them time, but as she got older they were beneficial to bring her body and mind into harmony.
Marina also helps her in the areas of meditation - usually following the intensive physical workouts - and her Force prowess in Telekinesis. If there’s time Marina challenges Joran to a spar, where the small space would probably be their undoing.

The days past swiftly, full of growth for both Kitkkata and Marina. The two go through Jedi meditation techniques and katas countless times, and the young Wookie proves to be a quick study. The highlight of the week is a moment when, through intense concentration, Kit is able to hang her latest artisitic creation from the ceiling in her bunkroom using only the Force. Unfortunately B3 was in standby mode and the exact translation of her obvious glee was unavailble.
During the last few hours Marina approaches Joran about sparring.
"**Given the excitement of last time we ignited our saber blades, I don't think these cramped quarters lend themselves to any sort of combat - mock or no. But I'm more than happy to get my mind off these schematics for awhile,**" he motions to some datapads strewn about his already tiny captain's bunkroom, "**Studying the most recent floorplans of the *Cleft* has given me little hope of ever rescuing KT-80 or any of the others. They've probably been wiped by now anyway I guess.**"
Joran goes on to setup a small table with a number of colored ball bearings and cups. "**It's a game I used to enjoy playing when I was a youngling, you've probably seen it once or twice. I've added a few twists to make things interesting…**" Over the next several hours the two Jedi enjoy moving the pieces across the table from each other and, while the concept is simple enough, it proves to be a nice distraction to pass the final leg of the journey to Tatooine.<div style="text-align: center;">

The *Nova* emerges from hyperspace on the edge of the Tatoo system in the silent of deep space and makes its way speedily to its destination - a vast, flat stretch of desert only a few kilometers from Mos Eisley. To the West lay a number of rocky formations, the three moons of the planet casting numerous shadows upon the sands. A lone figure stands beside a swoop bike with his hands hidden within the folds of his hooded robe. Joran approaches cautiously - more a force of habit than anything - and laughs when the stranger's face is revealed:
"**Master Obi-Wan! It's been too long!**"

Marina has five rolls to reach a total of 100, and can be a combination of any of the following skills/abilities: Knowledge (galactic lore), Perception, Use the Force, Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom and Charisma. Each skill/ability can only be used twice, and at least one of the rolls must be one of the listed abilities. So however that works for you. No Force Points. If you make the roll (and unless you let me or jaybee roll for you I think you will) you gain 1000XP and I think I'll give Kit Skill Focus(UtF). If you can beat 120, I'll give an additional 500XP. If not, it's some good RP filler.
Also, I think I inadvertently invented Force Pong, and I'm really not sure how this would play out according to George Lucas or canon, but we're gonna wing it regarding Obi-Wan's behaviour and whatnot.

The silliness of the game helps to ease the last of the tension Marina had been experiencing the last week. She was glad Joran hadn’t pressured her into giving over details about Iruji, and she was close to the point where she would gladly tell what Joran needed. But they were finishing up their business on Tattooine and there would be time enough to share.
Marina takes her seat in the copilot’s chair and watches as the sand covered planet grows larger. A strange thrill enveloped her, this planet seemed to reveal more secrets, about herself especially, every time she stepped foot on it. For a moment she wondered what her next revelation would entail. One thing was certain, the planet housed one of the last remaining Council Masters. This knowledge gave her hope that their Order wasn’t going to just die.
Following Joran down the ramp, the young Jedi looks around taking in the sights of the surrounding area. There’s a slight bounce to her step as she takes her first step on the planet’s surface, her mood significantly more jovial. Catching sight of the hooded figure she too approaches with caution, while she trusts Joran to have made contact with the actual Obi-wan, it didn’t hurt to be careful. They had after all been betrayed by the very people the Jedi had fought and died besides.
“**Master Kenobi,**” she starts with a slight bow. “**It’s an honor to finally meet you.**”

The three exchanges bows in the cool desert air, the gentle breeze a welcome addition to an otherwise warm Tatooine night.
"**Joran Nor - I'm glad to see you, my friend. Reunions like these are a rare occasion indeed nowadays, but all the more sweet when had.**"
The Master's voice is firm but kind, what one would expect from anyone with such experience sitting on the Jedi Council - even if for only few years. He turns to Marina with a smile:
"**And you must be Marina - the honor is mine. It's not often that Jedi Knights need rescuing and it's even less often from someone so young as you. Your service to Joran is most appreciated.**" Obi-Wan offers a second bow of thanks to Marina before continuing to the matter at hand.
"**Your message indicated your need for aid in eluding Imperial authorities. Ordinarily I'd say you'd be safe from them here, but then you also made mention of a bounty hunter. In that case I'm not certain this is where you ought to stay - they frequent the Outer Rim more often than you'd expect, and many are encouraged by the heavy bounties on Jedi. Their persistence is only equal to their pay, which is, of late, considerable. You are welcome to stay for awhile and rest or refuel if you like. It's been a long time since I've had company of any from the Order.**"
He beckons the trio - for Kitkkata has made her way down the ramp by now too - to follow him. He activates a remote from with his belt and two more speeders appear in a hidden compartment beneath the sands. Not all Jedi outcasts have hotels but Master Kenobi seems to have really capitalized on his time in isolation. Joran and Kit mount one of the bikes and Marina another and together they all travel to a cave in the small mountain range in the West. It's a pretty straight journey and only takes a few minutes by speeder bike. Thanks to the flat sands, and copious moonlight, the *Nova* can still be seen clearly in the distance.
"**This might be better…**" says Joran, retrieving a remote of his own and engaging the ship's cloaking device. The ship disappears from view completely, leaving no trace of its existence. The little campsite is protected from prying eyes by its location and a sliding hatch that resembles the native rockfaces. Within lay a fusion lantern, some pillows, a few computers of various use and a delicious-looking meal spread out on a low table.
"**The tea should just about be ready…**" mutters Obi-Wan as he makes himself busy at a little cooking station against the back wall. "**This isn't my place mind you, but I believe you'll be safe for a couple days.**"

Taking Kenobi’s compliment with a bit of pride she follows along toward the speeders. Mounting, she waits for Kenobi to set the direction before gunning the speeder’s engines. The surge was exhilarating and she enjoys the ride through the cooler evening air. Taking up a parallel course to Joran she takes a look over the landscaping keeping a close watch on the higher cliffs in the event and Sand People heard their speeders and decided to come investigate.
After making sure their bikes were hidden, Marina follows behind into the cave remembering the last time she had followed a Jedi into a cave system. It had resulted in her falling through a cave floor into tunnels below and fracturing her leg. Even with her recuperating abilities it had taken several weeks for her to get back to her full capabilities. Stepping into the cavern, she takes a glance around, appreciative of the fact it had already been set up for them.
“**Hope they won’t mind a few house guest,**” Marina says idly. “**Who else has lived here?**” Taking a seat at the table, she eyes the tea Kenobi is making with some disappointment wishing it was caf. The laid out food grabs her attention though, the fare being more appetizing then the processed food available on the ship, even if the main course included barbecued womp rat.

"**Oh, no one lives here *permanently*, but I use it from time to time for just such occasions as this.**" replies Obi-Wan, pouring some of the hot beverage for Joran and Kit. He offers some to Marina before filling his own cup and taking a seat. "**The galaxy is becoming a dangerous place for many people, not just Jedi, and you three aren't the first guests I've had for tea.**"
The following conversation is mostly a sharing of experiences since Order 66 and what news each has to offer of Jedi survivors and the growing resistance against the Empire. Kit - glad to know little about such things - is content to have her fill of food and drink and fall asleep on some of the nearby pillows. Eventually, as early morning breaks across the sands, Joran brings up the reason for their coming to Tatooine.
"**Well Master, I'm sorry to have risked meeting with you like this but I think you understand better than we do what a life on the run from Imperials is like. The *Nova* is a fast ship and she'll get us where we're headed, but we could do with some information on what our good friend Commander Chayse is up to. And, if possible, that Whiphid Marina ran into. Chayse isn't gutless but I don't think he's eager to admit his failure. Which means we need to be even more wary.**"
"**I see,**" says Kenobi, considering the request carefully. "**Well there's always the Holonet,**" he gestures to a small computer array in the corner, "**Most Imperial news gives some idea of all but the most secret military endeavours. It might be best to investigate matters personally though. I don't make a habit of visiting Mos Eisley if I don't need too but that's where you'll likely discover the whereabouts of Marina's bounty hunter.**"

Listening idly to the chatter between the two older Jedi, Marina too enjoys her share of the food, her youth making it easy to gorge herself. She pipes in when appropriate but keeps her thoughts to herself. As talk turns to surviving Order 66 her thoughts turn inward. She could almost remember the day clearly. As far as they were from the events, they were still pained by the disturbance in the Force as their brethren were cut down by their trusted allies. Silas had insisted Marina stay and wait for him to make contact with her. And so she had watch as her mentor and Arek left her, not knowing what fate would become them. Not knowing was probably the most difficult to endure, especially never knowing what would become of her child’s father. After waiting for a couple weeks, her meager supplies nearly exhausted so got work on the first ship that would take her. Thankfully she had come across Captain Vanar.
“**I have a feeling B’Dub won’t be one to let his prey go, especially with the way I tricked him. If anyone is following it will be him,**” Marina says, broken from her reverie. “**It’s worth a trip into town to see if I can learn more about him.**” The trip would also provide the opportunity to stretch her legs some. Maybe she could make a trip to Mos Espa if there was time.

"**Sounds good.**" says Joran. "**Kit and I will have to stay behind but maybe we can make some progress searching Holonet news archives for the time we were gone. If we're being followed I'd rather lose them here than up there.**" he finishes, pointing upwards.
"**And I must be going as well, though not to Mos Eisley. There are others that I must check up on.**" Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi stands and bows to both Marina and Joran Nor before offering a final word: "**You can reach me by secure comm channel as always Joran. I believe you'll both find your answers in time - and they may turn out to be different than what you had expected. May the Force be with you.**" He opens the hatch, spilling morning light into the small chamber, and leaves on his speeder. The hatch closes once more behind him, leaving Joran and Marina to speak alone.
"**I don't see any reason to wake her up just yet,**" says Joran, motioning to Kit, "**Cranky Wookies are never much fun. Be careful out there. We've no idea what's been going on since we left over a week ago.**"<div style="text-align: center;">

Marina navigates the desert sands at full throttle - topping out around 500 kilometers an hour - and finds an unusual beauty in the landscape speeding by. All around her are signs of lifelessness: unidentifiable bones jutting out from beneath the dunes, dried and dead flora, bare rock that provides little shade from the binary suns climbing through the sky. But juxtaposed against the backdrop of desolation are the warm sands - flowing endlessly like ancient waves only to break upon some distant barren shore. In many respects it was a safer place than where she was headed.
Mos Eisley spaceport was unrivaled in its reputation for catering to the dregs of galactic society, but if Marina wanted to find out about B'Dub it was the best place to go. Row after row of cheap dwellings, street bazaars full of shady vendors, even shadier cantinas and smugglers' ports - this was indeed, as Obi-Wan had mentioned earlier, a wretched hive of scum and villainy. Pulling up to the nearest entry gate, Marina pauses to ponder her next move.

Marina couldn’t help but enjoy the unique beauty of the desolate world. When she had been here before - *has it really just been over a year and a half?* - there hadn’t been much of an opportunity to explore beyond the gates of the city. Many would probably argue there wasn’t much to be seen, but as she spots the remains of what must have been a large Krayt Dragon, there was probably a great deal more to this world than met the eyes.
It was with some regret the young Jedi left the strange serenity of the dessert and entered through the gates of the turbulent city of Mos Eisley. Taking a moment to get a lay of the land, she quickly decides her first stop was going to be the local cantina. Not only had the trip across left her mouth dry, but the hearsay one could gather from such an establishment could be quite impressive. There had been many a time she and Silas had followed the trail of rumors to the most remarkable findings, after of course a misadventure.
Taking a look around the establishment, she tries not to focus on any one detail too long lest she draw the attention of any individual who might have an issue with such things. Making her way to the bar she takes a seat. When the bartender asks for her order, Marina takes a quick gamble and asks for what’s on tap. With her drink in front of her, she takes a sip of what passes as the local brew. “I wonder, do you think you could help me? I’m trying to track down an acquittance of mine who might have been past here.”

The bartender is a Zabrak - a very old one, judging by the white strands of hair hanging through his horns. He sizes Marina up as she approaches and answers her question. She sips the deep green concoction given to her, noting he didn't say what it was called.
"**An acquaintence, eh?**" he laughs, "**Lady we get all *kinda* people around here but none of 'em are  *acquaintances.* You want help you go to a hospital, or maybe a psychiatrist. You come here if you want drinks… and maybe information, but neither are free.**"

...hours spent on this particular venture. The actual dialogue may not represent it, but it's about more than that. Also go ahead and subtract 5c from your total for the drink, which I like to think is some variant on the ooze that transformed the ninja turtles. DC20 on Gather Information, RAW, will need 50c to get you something good, otherwise just RP and see what he's willing to share.

Marina smiles in what she hopes is a charming way as she puts the payment down on the counter adding an extra 10cr for good measure. When he comes closer to collect it she says in an undertone, "**My *friend* is a Whipid. Goes by the name B'Dub and generally travels with a horde of small remotes.**"

The Zabrak hesitates at the sight of the payment, then decides the extra coin never hurt anyone.
"***Friend*, huh? Not the way he tells it…**" he replies, examining Marina as if for the first time. "**Way he tells it someone bested him by messin' with his head. He was here alright, a couple days ago. Kinda creepy, you ask me - big guy like that surrounded by those little droids. And lady, I know creepy. Said his ship was…**" he stares off into the distance in deep thought for a moment before returning his gaze to Marina expectantly.
Her beverage has begun to change color to a bright blue and, unless she's mistaken, there's something moving in the glass.

It *is* creepy...

Catching the hint, Marina puts down 10 more credits prompting him to finish his tidbit. For a moment she wonders if the bounty hunter made Tattooine his regular haunt or if he had followed them here. If he was still around, she was going to have to take care of that part of the problem. Having him follow the Nova to Iruji wasn't in their best interest.
"**Do you know if he's still around?**" she asks once he's revealed his latest piece of intel.
