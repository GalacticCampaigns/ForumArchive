# [Reality Bytes] Short Circuit (Jason Drexler's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-01 21:18:04)

Shockboxing is organized violence. Many rich people would tell you differently, but to attend a match is to bear witness to some of the most gruesome, visceral combat in all the galaxy. It pulls spectators from all walks of life, and some are willing to pay almost anything to control the outcome of a fight. If corruption were a bacteria, shockboxing would be the petri dish most full to the brim with festering colonies. Tonight an up-and-coming fighter with a future as uncertain as his past is about to find that the most brutal battles imaginable can be viewed for the price of admission.
"**He's fighting *what*? That's not what I was told! I paid a very large sum of credits for the very best advance information and now you're telling me it was all for *nothing*? There's no way he can last against that. I don't know who picked the name but they must have some kinda cruel sense of humor. Call in all our debts, we've gotta move a lot money in not a lot of time.**" The man slammed the receiver down so hard it broke in two and sent pieces crashing into the wall of the VIP booth. Like so many in attendance tonight, he had purchased the identity of the defender and, like so many before him, he'd been lied to.<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

"**Okay Jason, this is it. This is the big one. You can do it kid, I know you can. *You* know you can. And that's all there is to it. See ya in a few.**"
At one time the words would have been comforting; after so many consecutive wins they were more a tradition than anything else. Big Macky, an overweight Dug and one-time circuit champion, had been with Jason since the beginning. He'd seen some pretty crazy things in his time, but nothing like the pinnacle of fighting perfection standing before him now. Throwing a towel over Jason's shoulder, he opens the door to the stadium and signals it's time for the young boxer to make his entrance.
"**Ladies and gentlemen, our next contender needs no introduction. With the longest winning streak *ever in shockboxing history* - JAAAASON DRRRREEEEXLERRRRR!**"
The crowd in the arena was already tense with excitement and bustling with last minute bets, now the situation might best be described as absolute frenzy. The last half of Jason's name is simply drown out by the noise level which, in addition to threatening to literally bring down the house, is a mixture of cheers, jeers and more than a few offers of marriage from females of a dozen different races. It rings like sweet music to his ears. Raising his hands and throwing his towel into the stands (which results in an actual catfight as two Cathar girls begin an unrestrained fistfight over it), Jason approaches the ring and takes his stool. The temptation to boast and push the crowd over the edge is strong, but that's something for lesser fighters. Few present doubted his victory against whoever came out of the defender's corner.
"**Yes, yes we all love 'em. But what of his opponent? Have you any idea who awaits our beloved Jason, ready to tear him limb from limb? Of course not. Honestly, neither do I. As a special treat for all of us here tonight, this carefully guarded secret has been orchestrated to ensure the show of a lifetime. The program only says-**"
The announcer's voice, amplified over hundreds of speakers, is cutoff as a blood-curdling roar reverberates throughout the arena. The defender's door bursts from its hinges as what must be the largest Togorian in recorded history leaps from the doorway clear to his corner. Flexing mighty chest muscles that no one questions could tear any challenger into very tiny pieces, he spreads his arms wide in defiance. If the top twenty contenders on the circuit were all to tackle this cat at once the outcome would likely be a very gory one, with plenty of Togorian to take on the next batch. Teeth bared, claws extended, he let's his roar hang in the still air. The energy present only moments ago has vanished. In its place a raw, primal fear - an awe that overides all failsafes of civilization and turns spectators into total barbarians content only with carnage. What seems like an eternity passes, and then the announcer begins once more, sounding like little more than a scared whelp struggling to finish his sentence: "**-Death Kitty.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Well. I think that was the most fun yet. For additional fun, we'll use the shockboxing rules on page 23 of *Galaxy at War*: "*Each shockboxer can make one skill check as a free action, describing how he or she tries to gain an advantage for that exchange of attacks…Success grants the combatant a temporary Force Point, which must be spent before the end of the next turn or it is lost. Typically, this Force Point is used to grant an bonus to attack rolls, but during a shockboxing match you can choose to add the results of a Force Point to you damage roll instead.*" Combat begins when you include an Initiative roll in a spoiler, I'll have a map up next week. Questions are welcome, as are bribes in the form of convincing **Magical2099** to throw his current arena match against Kaz Torev.

The words that the Dug offered had become almost a pre-fight ritual, they got Jason into the right frame of mind for the fight, his objective clear: knock his opponent out (at the very least). Hear the preamble of the announcer through the doors as he built the crescendo leading to his entrance, the boxer stood up, shook himself down and bounced on his toes awaiting his name.
**"….JAAAASON DRRRREEEEXLERRRRR!"**
He burst through the entranceway into the arena, his figure bathed in innumerate spot lights, hundreds of eyes now centred on him. He flashed a wink at one of the females who'd offered her hand in marriage, her knees crumbled at the attention from the superstar. Having thrown his towel into the crowd, he pulled up his cowl over his head and began the walk to the ring, energised on the rabble's passion.
Now in the ring, he takes off the cowl, passing it to Big Macky as he takes his stool. The only thing on his mind: "Who or what is coming through that door"
His question was quickly answered by the thunderous roar that silenced the crowd. *'Marvellous a Togorian.'* he thought to himself, as he recalled all his previous matches, confirming that he'd never fought one this size before. He turned to Macky, who's face at that moment could be read like an open book, and said with a smile across his face:
**"Well it's been a good run."**
The dug knew what to do if anything ever went awry, they'd been over the plan enough times. Jason just hoped he hadn't pawned the backup, but he wouldn't have blamed him either: vices and the means to feed them were second nature in this underworld.
The boxer stood, checking his gloves, the atmosphere of the crowd behind him completely different to before as he faced his opponent. His eyes were fixed on his opponent as he walked to the centre of the ring and his seemingly impending doom. He speaks solemnly to the referee:
**"Let's get this over with. …"**
Before turning to the crowd and amplifying his voice, playing up for them:
**"…because I didn't realise I would need to fight in an envirosuit! This thing's breath smells worse than a Hutt's armpit and the teeth I'll be knocking down this little Kitty's throat could do with a clean too!"**

The crowd laughs nervously at Jason's remark, clearly as nervous as he is. Surviving is an art, and Jason Drexler has painted many a masterpiece in his time. It's likely that this match will be the greatest of his life's work. Whether it's due to stunning victory or his hideously gruesome defeat is another story.
The giant cat's eyes steel for the fight. His curled lips release a guttural display of dark humor as well - a scratchy noise that approaches a laugh, but falls just short: "**We will see, young one. My teeth have been cut on far larger opponents than you. Hna'kra knows no fear. You will lose and then, very soon after, you will die.**"
Flexing his huge paws in their gauntlets, he assumes an aggressive stance and lumbers forward as the bell rings. The arena is mostly quiet, the crowd uncertain at what exactly will transpire this evening.

He'd always backed himself in his fights with increasingly large sums of credits - one of the reasons he'd amassed considerable wealth - and he also knew that a lot of those on the circuit did the same, whether they be promoters, trainers or the actual opposition. In fact it had come to the point where the odds on Jason winning were so stacked in his favour, it wasn't even worth it. This could be the upset that the bookies were looking for.
Lots of the opponents that Jason had faced had talked smack like the best of them, but rarely could they follow it up with such a fearsome presence. He had to admit that he was impressed and a little disappointed they hadn't fought sooner. *'Least he understands basic'*. As he zigzagged towards his opponent, bouncing on the balls of his feet, he used the time to try and decipher any weakness in his opponent that he could exploit, or at least goad it out of him.
**"You may find me a little harder than others to chew and I'll teach you to fear as I stand over your body, my fists raining down on you as you beg me for mercy."**
He brought his gloves up in front of him in a defensive stance, ready to attempt to counter the beast's massive paws.

The massive Togorian takes no notice of Jason's feeble attempts at intimidation and continues his advance. Now in the center of the ring, with the lights all centered on his giant frame, the crowd gets a good look at the "surprise" that had been planned in secret for their viewing pleasure. *Death Kitty* was clearly no kitten.
"***Knock his lights out Jason!***"
"***Yeah! TeeKay this overgrown fleabag!***"
Jason hadn't gained such a loyal following by chance, he was the best and they had faith their champ wouldn't disappoint. His opponent's gloves arced electric current back and forth as he brought his paws together, ready for more than just an exhibition.

Jason's knuckles cracked in his gloves as he tensed his hands into fists as he came to meet his opponent in the centre of the ring.
**"There are many ways to skin a cat, you'll all get to see a demonstration with my fists."** He threw some more insults at the prickly furball, knowing that they'd have no impact on a true fighter but it's what the fans like to hear.
The difference in height was astonishing, the young human boxer was completely eclipsed - an eclipse he'd like to see the other side of.
*'I'll have to fight this one with some intelligence, I can't beat him on brute force alone. If only I had a ball of string.'* Now stood toe-to-toe in the pocket, Jason bobs and weaves, throwing a series of feints before following them up with the real punches.

Jason engages with the confidence of someone standing on a no-loss record, but his deceptive moves have no affect on his feline foe. He throws the first punch, which is dodged and countered - but he sidesteps the counter-punch easily and throws in a little jab of his own. The cat winces as the blow glances off his solid ribcage.
*This one punches with the strength of one greater than his size. No matter. His head will hang in shame soon enough.*
The pair size each other up and the chatter begins to grow from the seats once more as the fickle mob begins to take sides. The growls of *Death Kitty* match the low rumbling of the energy flowing through his gloves.
"**You have many secrets, young one, and so does Hna'kra.**"
The Togorian flashes a sinister grin and waits for Jason's next assault.

Your feint didn't work, no surprise there. You're still in H4, and he hasn't moved. **DK is now down 4hp due to Jason's *Retaliation Jab***.

Usually the aggressor, Jason sits back after his first punch misses his target, managing to pull off a quick jab to his opponent's stomach.
*'He's quick for something that size! But I'm quicker.'* He thought as the combatants stare each other down, waiting for the next strike.
The crowd was certainly going to get their credits' worth this time, it was an infrequent occurrence for any fight to last longer than Jason's initial punch.
**"Secrets? Like what? It's no secret you're going to lose this match."**
No sooner had Jason finished his statement, he fakes a sidestep to his right before ducking down and bringing his curled fingers up underneath the moggy's chin.

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-10 13:16:09)

The swing catches the Togorian unawares and the sound of his jaw cracking under the blow is heard easily over the noise of the arena. He reels backwards a few steps, then shakes his head to clear his blurred vision.
"**You will pay for that, kitten. You will pay *dearly*.**"
He lunges forward and brings the full weight of his giant frame to bear in a forward jab that manages to get past Jason's defense. The crowd roars - some with glee and some with outright rage - as the Togorian's massive paw slams into his opponent's mechanical frame. While the audience doesn't seem to notice, *Death Kitty* hears the clanging of the metal gloves on metal chassis... and doesn't seem the least bit surprised.

Jason basked in his moment of satisfaction as his feline combatant's jaw broke, before being racked by a blow that had the force and speed of an out of control pod racer at the Boonta Eve Classic. The punch itself wasn't the main concern, it was the noise that it had made. He knew he had heard it, he also knew his opponent had heard it to based on the smug expression on his now asymmetric face, but had the crowd heard? Based on the din still reverberating around the arena they hadn't and it would seem that Jason had luck on his side, for the time being. He also knew that he had to finish this fight quickly if he was going to leave with his reputation still intact.
**"As will you….for that…."** The droid spluttered, catching his breath after the attack. For even though he had been built, he still shared the majority of the same organs as humans and their associated drawbacks.
Silently disabling the limits on his internal capacitors, power surges through his frame, pumping his pistons to speeds beyond their tolerance as he fires off another blow towards the Togorian's bruising face.

Jason's metal fist catches the other side of the Togorian's face and his electric glove crackles loudly. The giant stumbles backward, staggering from the blow. The crowd seems to once more be mostly against the "surprise" defender, and several shouts of victory erupt from the stands. He wipes his bloodied mouth, and leaps at Jason. A roar like the one he entered the ring with escapes his lips as he draws a hidden dagger from his belt. He tackles the droid-who-would-be-champion and, raising one hand high above his head, prepares to ram the blade as deep as he can into Jason's metal body.
"**And now, *machine*…you *DIE!***"
Time seems to slow for everyone present that night. Later reports would be conflicting: Some would say it was a barrage of blaster fire, some would say malfunctioning power cables. Still others would claim meteorological interference on an unprecedented level. Not everyone had heard the last words uttered from the ring, so speculation regarding even that was widespread. Jason's digital mind was able to see things clearer than most, and what his optics captured seems more unreal than any other explanation given.
As his foe lifted his hand to deliver the deathstroke, an unnatural bolt of lightning broke through the arena dome and struck the risen blade. The noise of the raw energy crashing through the roof, and the resulting screams as it courses through the Togorian, certainly left a powerful, if not mixed, impression on his memory. The ring lights explode as the presence of such a rogue power completely overrides electrical backup routes and overloads arena fuses, melting the interior junction boxes. Jason records the sights and sounds only moments before his processor itself overloads and safety protocols re-engage to prevent a total system meltdown. Immediately after the strike, rainwater pours in through the gaping hole above and soaks the central area of the arena - including both contenders - now laying on opposite sides of the ring, shrouded in darkness.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Lots of fun posts this week already! So I'm going to let you keep your processor due to the use of *Power Surge* acting as a sort of unrestrained buffer against the onslaught against Jason's systems. I'm also going to let the FP spent to keep DK flat-footed carry over and let you be disabled, not destroyed. I want to take a break here and give you the opportunity to have some sort of dream or out-of-body experience. Have fun, be creative, and we'll resume after you've got something good up. ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

His vision crackled, blurred momentarily by a manufacturer's logo, before returning to the scene at hand. Clenched in his fist was a Rodian's throat, his bulbous eyes inflated further with the pressure of the durasteel grip as he made a desperate attempt to squeak out an apology.
**"It's too late now. You will make amends for the trouble you've caused."**
The voice came from behind the droid, it was calm and spoken in a matter of fact manner. Another series of squeaks came from the Rodian as slipped increasingly into panic. The droid noted the elevated heart rate as the three-chambered heart began to pump its owner's blood frantically around its body. A tap on the automaton's shoulder signified for him to release his grip enough to let the Rodian speak.
**"…it was a set up…we were ambush—"**
Before he got a chance to finish, another tap signalled him to tighten his grip once more. The voice sighed and a change in tempo and tone indicated that it had become irritated.
**"You don't lie in a situation like this. Your Sabaac die have already been rolled and if you just tell me where the shipment is I might just tip one of them in your favour."**
A puzzled look shot across the Rodian's face, which had changed from a deep green and was now going through various different shades of crimson. If asked, the voice's droid would have said it was now a slightly darker hue of Tattooine Sunset. A tap was felt on his shoulder once more.
**"O..K…..The package is cu….rrently being….loa….ded onto the *'The Hidden Krayt'* … in docking bay 12…"**
Sensing no change in pulse or dilation in his prey's pupils, the perspective shifted from along the droid's arm to over his shoulder to where the voice has been coming from, revealing its owner for the first time. A cowled male human with sickly pale skin stood inspecting his nails with a synthsteel file in one hand that occassionally brushed across his nails. He was short in stature, leading the droid to believe that he was fairly young for a human. The human stood in th chamber's entrance, the droid, Rodian and upended table taking up the rest of the space. On the floor had been scattered hundreds of small denominations of credit chips along with various paper work all dusted with a fresh layer of spice.
**"Observation: He speaks the truth."**
The voice felt strange coming from the perpective but there was an air of familiarity about it. Without uttering a word, the human nodded, and flicked his hand dismissing the droid as he turned to leave, stepping over two dismembered Gammorean guards in the corridor. Without turning back the droid, twist his wrist, snapping the Rodian's vertebrae, he felt the body's weight in his arm as it's pistons compensated the load. Letting it fall to the floor in a heap, the droid followed his master out of the chamber.

The droid's optics flicker to life. It turns slowly, taking in its surroundings and adjusting visual input levels. His auditory receptors pick up a voice nearby:

At first I wanted to write up a really long post describing this process, but I think I'd like to play it out a bit.

This is a very Frankenstein/Robocop moment, so take your time. I've been able to get nearly a post/day with Marina, so your posts can be pretty short if you like (this one was only, what - three lines?). Let me know if you have any questions!

## Short Circuit (Jason Drexler's Story)

### **jaybee3** (2011-11-09 16:43:34)

His sensors were suddenly flooded with information upon reanimation and it took a few seconds before the brightness and contrast levels of his optics to adjust to the real world. Diagnostics information on exposure, white balance and metering were now projected onto his vision. Upon internally selecting appropriate options, The droid's optics clicked and whirred, as the optical zoom adjusted it's focus in and out until the figure making the terrible din came into view.
A message flashed across his vision: *"Optical diagnostics and calibration complete. Now performing at a satisfactory levels to a 95% confidence level as defined by factory settings."*
Able to read the technician's lips as he spoke, it was unsatisfactory for long term comprehension. Currently his audio receptors were overloaded by a garbled din from every sound in the immediate area all at the same volume - enough to make a human's ears bleed. Fine tuning the frequencies of the incoming noise and compensating it against the distance from him, he was able to bring the volume under control relatively quickly.
Another message blinked in front of him to the same displaying a similar message about his audio.
His processor also performed a full diagnostic and calibration on his vocabulator. The sound emitted from the droid slid up and down octave scales and volumes, before settling on a fairly robotic sounding default that repeated a Basic pangram several times. Dissatisfied, the owner spoke his preferred settings and the vocabulator adjusted accordingly.
**"Human Male Basic Calm."**
The same pangram was repeated afterwards several times against his will as it looped through the preprogrammed scripts. A third message popped up into his perspective asking him to confirm his satisfaction with his voice. Selecting the affirmative response, the basic diagnostic menus disappeared giving him a full view for a few moments before another menu popped up: *"Perform full motor capability diagnostics and calibration? Y/N/Run in Background."*
Send his calibration to be completed by secondary memory, he addressed the questions posed to him.
**"Confused response: Jason? Did you mean the Jaso Sector in the Inner Rim? Or perhaps the ancient Jassim Design? Proud statement: I have over three billion listed articles on the term Jason."**
He put up the facade of ignorance in an attempt to draw his captors in closer so that at the right moment he could lash out and hopefully take one hostage and drain them of information on his capture. Another message flashed across his view.
*"Motivators in your upper right limb are fully operational. Continuing to left upper limb…"*
He activated another internal diagnostic to see if there were any foreign objects detected within him that would hinder his escape or further confirm his suspicions about his captors, not that he needed to be given a reason to end their existences.

"**I suppose that's a 'yes'.**" the voice mutters.
A number of small droids crawl off of Jason's chassis, and he's able to see a number of figures in the dark room standing around his metal body, staring silently. There are a couple Humans, but the rest are a mix of Rodian, Twi'lek, Gamorrean, Zabrak and Bothan silhouettes. The bright lights directly above him allow them to view him clearly, while his darkvision capabilities are required to recognize Jason's 'admirers'. The nearest Human - the source of the muttering - turns his back to Jason and addresses the crowd:
"**As you can see, gentlemen, Jason Drexler lives again. I needn't tell you the advantages of owning such a unique fighter. Bidding is now open, but please - do so electronically. There's no need to shout like uncivilized thugs.**"
The figures all retrieve simple devices and beginning typing figures furiously. The Human paces quietly around Jason's body, a droid caller in his hand.
*Motivators now 100% online…full motor capability…foreign system detected: restraining bolt…*

*'Activate purge subroutines….I want rid of that restraining bolt. In the meantime, should we join the party? I don't want myself going for a bargain to some useless meatsack'!*
The droid said to himself, before shooting his hand into the air and bellowing:
**"30 million credits!"**

## Re: Short Circuit (Jason Drexler's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-11 13:57:44)

Jason finds himself frozen in that position, unable to move or speak any further, as the Human walks calmly around to peer into his optics: "**Now now, save that fight for later!**" He waves the caller in plain sight, mocking Jason's attempts.
A low chuckle circulates the room as the gathered crowd finishes with their bidding devices and laugh at the droid's tenacity. The main lights come on and the ex-champion shockboxer sees the group begin to leave. "**Thank you all for coming gentlemen, the delivery will be made within the hour to the highest bidder per our agreement.**"
They all file out and then the Human turns to Jason once more:
"**Such a fine fighter - but you've got to learn your place. No more of this ridiculous freedom you've been allowed for so long. You'll learn to serve your newest master…which would be…**" he retrieves a datapad and brings up the bidding results, "**… the illustrious Jabba the Hutt. Not who I expected, but clearly desperate for some new entertainment. I believe he resides in a palace on Tatooine. You should have plenty of opponents to fight there, but watch your step - he has little patient for rebellious droids, especially ones he's paid so much for. Now, nighty-night.**"
The man punches a series of buttons into the datapad and Jason Drexler deactivates once more.<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

"***So this is the great Jason Drexler! You will serve me well or you will be buried in the desert sands, now fight!***"*
Jason's systems all reach 100% status in moments. He finds himself in a room largely made of stone, a Hutt - presumably Jabba - and his host of thugs staring at him through a reinforced plastex wall on one end and an open hatchway on the other. Sunlight spills in through the opening and the sound of a large crowd can be heard. The restraining bolt is still in place, but a new layer of synthetic skin covers his frame. Great care has been taken to restore him to his previously recognizable condition. The group behind the plastex begins to rise slowly on a lift in the floor.

Watching the lift ascend to what he presumed would be a viewing platform to whatever the chanting outside was about, Jason made his last few preparations for the fight ahead.
*'So Jabba owns me now, years of being free and I'm a slave again. Although it looks like he's done a pretty good job of refurbishing my chassis.'*
He pulls forward his shorts and takes a quick glance before nodding in appreciation.
*'Well they got the gender right too, kudos…and it looks like an upgrade. Wonder if I've got any others?'*
After tightening the straps on his gloves, the ex-champ claps his hands, controlling an arc of lightning between them as he pulls them apart before clenching them into fists. Now ready for anything that can be thrown at him, he walks slowly towards the light and through the opening to the deafening clamour of the crowd, his eyes quickly adjusting to the harsh suns of tatooine with a UV filter. The shimmersilk robe, emblazoned with *'DREXLER'*, which was draped over his skin offered very little protection from the sun, but that was the least of his worries.
*'Who knows what this overgrown slug's got cooked up for me, I've heard he has a penchant for dangerous pets and bounty hunters.'*

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-16 15:49:50)

Tatooine's twin suns are high overhead as Jason Drexler enters the arena - for that is, indeed, what it is. Tall sandstone pillars supporting high carved seating (and all manner of improvised box seats) around a vast oval of desert sand, littered with bones and debris from previous 'games'. There must be more than a thousand spectators all shouting cheers and jeers for the newly reborn droid shockboxing champion.
As he steps out and turns, Jason can see Jabba himself in a special viewing area directly over the stone room he just exited. He slithers forward and waves to the crowd as a young Twi'lek steps forward and makes an announcement:
"***The illustrious Jabba Desilijic Tiure bids you welcome to his Dune Arena!***"*
The crowd thunders in response and Jason has a hard time hearing anything other than the frenzied roar of that masses.
"***…something special for you today! Behold - Jason Drexler, undisputed shockboxing champ of the GALAXY!!!***"
The spectators all jump to their feet (those who hadn't done so yet) and the sound threatens the arena on an architectural level. Jason can literally feel the excitement of the crowd.
"***…but who should he fight for us? What opponent could possibly offer sport to such a promising gladiator - surely destined to be the favorite of young and old?***"
Suddenly, there is silence. The wind whistles over the sand and all is still. Slowly, a whisper grows - a steadily growing chant can be heard, rolling across the audience. At first it seems incoherent, just a mish-mash of different tongues uttering gibberish. But as Jason listens intently, he discerns a single name: *Hna'kra*.
A small drone hovers down from Jabba's podium and scans Jason for a moment, then retreats to a higher altitude just in time to catch the doors at the other end of the arena burst open. The entrance is accompanied by a familiar roar and the sight of a very large, very scarred Togorian running out to meet him.

Jason pumps his fist into the air, soaking in the atmosphere and the warmth from the binary star.
*'Looks like I'm Jabba's toy for the time being.'* He said to himself after finishing internal diagnostics on himself, finding the restraining bolt still firmly in place. *'Still I can use that to my advant–'*
His thoughts were cut short by the chanting of an oh-too familiar name, before the telltale sign of doors flying off hinges confirmed his opponent, Death Kitty, or so he was called when they last fought. He had no idea how long it had been since they last battled, to the droid it could have been a couple of days ago, but from the extent of the rebuild it could have been any period of time.
**"Looks like the illustrious Jabba has been kind enough to orchestrate a rematch. No force majeur will stop me from destroying you this time, Kitty."** He shouts at the oversized feline bolting towards him as he goes through his pre-flight ritual: Bouncing on his toes, he swings his arms in windmills, limbering up his joints before moving on to his head, rolling it in circles before snapping it quickly to the side and back again with a crack and then after a quick couple of squats, he's ready.
Even though you would have thought a droid wouldn't need a warm up, especially in the current heat, it added to his illusion, but also gave him time to calmly survey the arena for any weapons or obvious pitfalls.
Clapping his hands together, he pulls his hands apart as the familiar electricity arced and crackled between them, before he clenched them together and adopted his usual shockboxing stance.

## Re: Short Circuit (Jason Drexler's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-09 11:01:03)

The tension only builds as Jason takes his time warming up and taunting with such an imminent threat rushing to meet him. The time is well-spent though, and he discovers a few things not readily apparent at first. The layout of the arena itself is fairly basic - large, circular, and full of sand. The high walls could probably be scaled but Jabba no doubt has orders to end such attempts abruptly - he can see at least a dozen soldiers patrolling the perimeter of the pit. There's also couple gates where opponents or props could be introduced, but all are shut - even the one he emerged from. Half-buried in the sand at his feet is a rusty vibroblade.
Hna'kra - Death Kitty - continues to approach rapidly and calls out to the droid boxer:
"**There are no storm clouds to save you here Jason Drexler, today will be your end!**"
The crowd is at fever pitch waiting to see such a rare treat in Jabba's Dune Arena - usually the matches are less even. A rancor against a handful of unarmed farmers or some such thing. The drone maneuvers to a position directly above the two as the Togorian finally reaches Jason, nearly frothing at the mouth with unchecked rage. He appears to be unarmed - if a giant feline being with massive musculature and razor-sharp claws could be considered that. He leaps into the air in an attempt to get the drop on his metal opponent but miscalculates and falls just short of landing on him. The dust from his landing creates a temporary cloud around the two that leaves the crowd guessing as to who will land the first blow.

You win the Initiative, so you can take your first turn now. Picking up an item is a *Move* action if you want that vibroblade (it's within reach). You're also toe-to-toe with DK, so doing that will allow an Attack of Opportunity. I'm using a more or less pre-made archetype for him this time since I can't find my notes from before and I don't really have the time to make a new one. We'll use those shockboxing rules if you attack with your gloves, he's not wearing any though.

*'Doesn't look like I'll be escaping during the battle either…* The droid said to himself as Hna'kra bore down on him after surveying his surroundings, noting the positions of the guards along the perimeter of the arena wall.
Kitty kicked up a cloud of dust as he landed in front of droid, Jason knew he could have finished it then and there if he wanted, but he decided to give the crowd what they'd paid to see.
**"Storm clouds? Looks like you've kicked up a dust storm with your lack of depth perception! Maybe you need a new pair of eyes to go with your nice new shaven look."**
Preferring his fists and his combat tactics over a blade any day, the mechanical combatant dropped to the ground and scooping up a handful of the coarse Tatooine desert sand, flung it in his feline foe's face, before following it up with a swift jab from his other hand.

The tactic works in affecting Hna'kra's footing, but Jason's jab falls just sort of the stumbling Togorian, reeling from the stinging sand in his eyes. Drawing his left arm back, he let's throws his body into a crushing hook but misses horribly. Cheers turn to jeers and the fickle audience begins to lose faith in the enormous combatant. Nearly frothing with rage he takes the opportunity to backhand the overconfident droid on a return swing, which lands - much to his satisfaction.
Jason's metal chassis reverberates with the loud clanging noise of finally meeting the wrath of the *Death Kitty* and his holographic appearance flickers as his systems compensate. The crowd erupts once more and begins chanting the giant cat's name again.

The hit shook Jason's frame like a swipe from a Rancor, his vision momentarily cracked and blurred at the periphery.
*'Where did that come from?'* L0 thought, shaking his head to clear his mechanical senses as the taste of iron filled his mouth. Spitting the blood from his mouth and wiping his mouth clean with his wrist, he bellowed at the Togorian furiously:
**"No-one makes me bleed my own blood!"**
His baffling comment was followed with another jab to his opponent's stomach, buying him some time to run emergency diagnostics and subroutines to recover some of his damaged circuitry.
Sweeping another large amount of sand up, this time with his foot, the droid activated the first of many holoprojections, creating a life like copy of himself a few feet away to his left. Now in full swing, the droid breaks through his manufacturer's original limitations as power surges through him, no doubt voiding his warantee.
Within milliseconds the Jason twins, throw a flurry of punches at the monstrosity in front of them. The were all feints to bewilder the cat's defense, before dropping his holotrickery so he could connect with an elbow aimed at his opponent's once fur lined jaw.

Jason's tactic works, and Hna'kra takes both the jab and the blow to the chin and staggers back. He maintains his composure though and returns with another ferocious jab of his own straight to the droid's already damaged chassis... connecting once again. Jason manages to turn enough to keep it from wreaking havoc on his systems like the first one, but can't prevent the Togorian's massive fist from causing considerable damage.
The sound of the metal and synthflesh giving way under Hna'kra's assault is drown out by the crowd's shouts of *DK! DK! DK!* - an obvious slant on Jason's traditional cheer.
"**You see *droid*? The lightning could not finish me, you could not finish me… but this will be your last fight. A more public disgrace than even I could have asked for you. I hope I can get a good price for your parts…**"

*'What's wrong with this beast? He was much easier first time round….'* Jason murmured to himself as Hna'kra didn't seem to flinch at his hits, before receiving one to his already damage chest. Although the synthskin turned a red hue, simulating the bruising starting to take place under the surface, his internal mechanics were taking the toll and damage reports flashed up in his line of sight once more.
**"Confident Statement: You think you've won already? … this fight hasn't even begun!"** Jason's voice couldn't be masked and it reverted to it's traditional formatting as other personalities began to take over.
*'Ah Jason, you haven't even come close to pushing yourself…so many years wasted against opponents in the ring. Opponents that pale in comparison to what I've seen. Opponents that make this overgrown sack of meat look like a noble's lap pet. Don't worry though, I'll handle it from here.'*
Messages streamed across the droid's vision as his limits were pushed once more, doing untold damage to his internal systems but that would be nothing compared to his next gambit.
A smile crossed the droids face as the holoprojector's flickered around him morphing his apparent appearence into that of a Shistavanen, a fearsome looking canine species. The smile turned into a snarl as Jason's new persona bore his teeth, letting out a roar before swiping at the Togorian with both fists.

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-15 17:00:25)

Jason's strategy works perfectly. The combination of taunting, playing dirty and shifting holographic appearances culminates in an opening in the Togorian's defenses - which proves to be his downfall. The droid boxer's metal hands slam into his opponent's scarred chest with a satisfyingly gruesome *crunch*, knocking him off his feet. He lands a full ten meters away in a cloud of dust, motionless.
The drone - content to have watched from a distance now zooms in to catch Jason from all angles. Displays mounted all over the Arena suddenly switch to take the live feed and he finds the once fickle crowd to have a champion once more. They begin to chant Jason's hallmark call in unison: *TK, TK, TK…*
"***Extraordinary! A stunning victory from the newcomer - JAAASOOON DRRREXLERRR!!!***" shouts the Twi'lek announcer finally. The post-game frenzy continues for sometime, with instant replays of the final blow and close-ups of the downed Togorian. The crowd eventually demands to hear from the champion himself, and the drone hovers even closer to Jason to hear what words he might offer...

Content on the result of his attack and that DK wouldn't be getting back up, Jason's new personality disengages the holoprojectors in a way it makes him look like he's morphing back into his humanoid form.
*'That…Jason…is how's it done….Welcome to super stardom!'* The personality says with a smile on the droids face as he punches the air to the cheers of the crowd.
Darkness becomes light as Jason's vision flickers back to life as the ghost in the machine disappears. At some distance away the body of the Togorian lies limp on the ground as thoughts cross the droid's mind:
*'I did it! But how? ….'* He looks to the monitors, showing his knockout punch in superslow motion. *'…I did that?…Well if I did, I better make it believable!'*
He turns to the droid floating above him as he begins to saunter towards his downed opponent and begins his usual post match banter:
**"As soon as I saw those doors fly off the hinges, this match was over. I've done it before…I've done it now…and I'll be damned if I don't do it again!"** Pausing he revels in the moment as the crowds cheer, basking in his glory, before continuing once more. **"Sure, I had to change into a form that only those closest to me have ever seen before, but I thought, I'd do it for my fans out there, they want a show…I'll give them one. *Especially in the illustrious Jabba Desijilac's Arena.*"** He said, turning to Jabba and bowing before continuing again on his walk **"The question on everyone's lips….or whatever you have stuck to your face….is: What do we do with our Togorian friend here?"**
Jason's arm trembled as he lifted the hulk from the ground until their heads were level, naturally the Togorian's legs were still half bent due to his massive size and Jason not being tall enough to lift him fully off the ground. The battle had certainly taken it's toll on him, but as always he put on a face for the cameras.
*'I'll definately need a mechanic and a bacta tank bath after this.'* He thought before holding his fist out to the audience, his thumb pointing parallel to the sand beneath.
**"Do we throw him to the Sarlacc? Or let him fight another day?"**

The shouts of the crowd are hard to discern at first - the cacophony simply defies coherence. Eventually, as Jason makes good on his offer and waits for a clear response, a verdict by consensus emerges:
"***Life! Life! Life!***"
It's an unexpected turn of events for long-time *Dune Arena* followers but a welcome one nonetheless. Jason's spotless reputation in the ring spills over even here and few are willing to tarnish the champion's image by having him stoop to that base level of cold-blooded murder. Some are visibly upset at the unusual vote by majority but the sight of the armed guards does much to quell their tempers.
Jabba, too, is pleased with his new fighter. While a word from him would mean instant death for both gladiators, he allows the crowd to have their hero. Popularity is measured in credits and Jason Drexler may yet become *very* popular.

Even with the shouts of the crowd, the droid did consider snapping the neck of his beaten opponent, but alas he gave his body a once over seeing if there was anything of note to plunder to use as emotional leverage in their inevitable next bout before tossing the mass of flesh to the floor.
He spins around the arena working the crowd once more, before speaking to the drone once more, his arm outstretched towards the body on the floor: **"You've spoken! … He lives! Let's hope he proves more of a match next time!"**
Jason begins to walk towards the entrance way where he'd entered from the stopped and spoke to the drone floating above him once more, finishing with a wink: **"Oh one more thing … are there any ladies out there that want to have some fun…. I mean… help me relax!"**

There's nothing of significance on the Togorians unconscious body and a pair of droids soon approach from within the walls to retrieve it.
Dozens of females respond to Jason's invitation and it takes several guards to keep them from literally crawling over each other. One - a scantily-clad human - did manage to break through. Her judgement regarding the whole matter was in question, however, when she hurled herself over the banister and fell to the arena floor where she now lay motionless.
"**Hey *champ*,**" comes a sarcastic voice from Jason's entrance chamber, "**You don't need a lady to help you *relax*, you need a lady to fix your chassis before you have a *core breach!***" The voice belongs to a young Falleen dressed in dirty brown overalls and bearing an array of tools that makes her role in Jabba's arena obvious. She's quite stunning to behold - despite the dark grease that seems to cover more of her face than not.
The crowd has begun its exodus, the other ladies clearly not as interested in the offer as the human. The only action left is the droids carting her body from the arena.

*'Ouch'* Jason mutters to himself as he watches the body plummet and hit the ground with a crunch. He scans the other women at the walls, noting their faces and distinguishing features - he is a hot blooded male after all - before being beckoned back to his 'dressing room'. With one final wave to the crowd, and blowing a few kisses to the more zealous members of the crowd, he heads back through his entrance.
*'Oh ho ho, what do we have here. A present from the illustrious Jabba? Oh, he's too kind!'* He thinks to himself upon a cursory glance, before noting the tools hanging from her belt and the grease smeared over her face. Jason moves closer to the Falleen as she speaks, his body language evident at what he really wants.
**"I've got a better idea, how about I breach your core and we can make sparks fly."** He said with a grin.

The door slides shut behind Jason as he enters the chamber. Falleens are known galaxy-wide for their beauty and the female mechanic standing before him is no exception. The grubby jumpsuit hugs her curves in all the right places and the weight of all the tools threatens to reveal more than is intended up top. Her dark braids hang about her shoulders, decorated with clean blue ribbon - a welcome sight in her otherwise dirty, but nonetheless stunning, appearance. They only serve to accentuate what shows of her dark green skin and her intense eyes. She matches Jason's pace and approaches with no small amount of body language herself. Laying a hand to rest on his shoulder she looks seductively into his eyes:
"**Mmm.. that sounds like fun, *champ*, but like I said -**" she says, before ramming an arc wrench into a gaping wound on Jason's side - courtesy of Hna'kra's first assault, "**- first things first.**"
The pain is intense but the point is made. Before the conversation or any repairs can continue Jabba's platform begins its descent behind the back wall. The Falleen quickly backs away from Jason and assumes a more professional posture, busying herself by retrieving and activating a scanner device from within her pocket.
"***You have fought well, Jason Drexler, and the crowd seems to enjoy watching you. I, however, prefer matches to last much longer. It makes the victory all the more sweet. Remember this next time.***"* says Jabba. The platform continues to lower past floor level and soon he and his entourage are out of sight.

Jason's eyes narrow as he takes the pain with a look that would scream a thousand expletives at her. The repairs are cut short by Jabba as his platform slithers past them. Jason acknowledges his words with a nod before he disappears out of sight once more, leaving the droid and the Falleen alone.
*'Of course, he prefers to play with food before eating it, the disgusting slug….anyway it wasn't exactly a match I wanted to prolong.'* His sycophancy couldn't be masked in his thoughts as he knew he was a slave once more. Turning back to the Falleen once more admiring what a truly pleasing specimen of her species she was as she busied herself with her scanner.
**"Before we get back to "business:" You obviously know me, the *champ*…"** The droid placed the same emphasis on 'champ' as she did. They did say that imitation was the highest form of flattery. **"…who doesn't? But what should I call you and what can I do to persuade you to remove this bolt?"**

The Falleen watches Jabba disappear out of the corner of her eye then turns back to Jason. She begins her work - with more skill and less pain than before - and answers his questions:
"**A lot of people call me a lot of things,**" she says, beginning with one of Jason's damaged leg motivators, "**but if you're asking my name, it's Sera.**" Her hands move swiftly across the synthskin, checking for anything more than minor abrasions. Coming to the gash in Jason's side, she continues her work. "**As far as removing that restraining bolt, well, I can't help you much there. I'm not the one who fits them and they've got some interesting little features that I've learned to be wary of. The last droid to try and pry it off is currently serving as the bulk of our spare parts inventory.**" Finished with the mechanical repairs to his side, Sera moves to his left shoulder joint - sorely in need of some new socket bolts. She pulls some from her pocket and begins to pull out the damaged ones with her power wrench. She's content to work silently for the moment, her attention fully on Jason's arm. After a couple minutes of work, Sera stands back and switches out her handtools for some Bacta patches and salve to repair his synthskin wounds.
"**Of course it's still just a piece of machinery like any other. Removing it isn't possible but scrambling the tracking signal might be…**" says Sera. Her hands move to Jason's side as she stands - a little closer than is necessary. Her body presses against his and her voice takes on a seductive tone once more: "**…if you're willing to take some risks. *Are* you willing to take some risks… *champ***?"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Trying to not be grossed out here, even though I know some things you don't. I couldn't think of a good name based on the Falleen suggestions, but I like that her name is the verb "to be" in Spanish but has both an angelic connotation and science-fiction history. I'd say you're at full hp now - as long as you're take it easy for a little bit. Mechanically you're all set (she's very good at fixing giant cat paw-shaped dents I guess) but your synthskin needs some time to heal. Normally this is eight hours, so we'll go by that guideline. Otherwise it may tear open again or whatever. Don't worry too much about it, but I'm just saying focus more one the RP than running back out for round two.

The droid stood stoically as the falleen went to work on him, disturbing her from her work with his attempts at flirty conversation every now and again.
**"Well, Sera, it's a pleasure to meet you and especially under such circumstances."** He gave a cheeky smile before continuing on. **"…I mean if all of my bouts are going to be followed by a woman running her fingers over my body, then I should fight more often!"**
Dismayed to hear that the bolt couldn't be removed during his repairs, Jason's hopes of freedom were momentarily dashed until he heard that they could be scrambled.
**"Risks, eh?"** He said pushing his body into hers, before reaching down and scooping up her legs in an attempt to wrap them around his waist, supporting her frame with his arms. Their faces now an inch apart, and a number of his stiches now ripped open again by the sudden effort, he spoke again. **"…I'm always willing, *Sera*, providing the risks have a *reward*. In this case, I'll take the risk."**

Jason immediately realizes that Sera's weight and center of gravity are off for someone of her build. As if in answer to his unspoken question, she pulls aside one of her overall's straps to reveal a worn restraining bolt just below her left collar bone. The flesh around the bolt is peeled back from constant wear and, while not bloodied or scabbed, leaves a small uncovered area which provides a clear view of a metallic frame beneath.
"**You're not the only one with synthskin around here you know…**" she replies, content at first to stay put. When some of his wounds threaten to tear wide open again, however, Sera leaves the embrace to touch up her previous work. She explains while she applies further bacta straps and stitches:
"**Maybe we ought to keep you to light duty for a little while though, at least until you're healed up. Jabba doesn't wait long between matches and we've probably got less than a day to get you presentable again. The ladies love to see a handsome face and I wouldn't want to be the one to disappoint them. Once I've finished this I'll take a look at that bolt. It's a pretty sophisticated design but it has one major flaw - the transmitter signal that they use to keep track of us follows a set pattern of change. I've managed to mask it before, but never for very long. They *can't* see where we are but they *can* notice we're missing, so timing is critical. It'll take me awhile to splice into it, so you'll have to shutdown for a bit. Probably for the best anyway, since with both of us awake there's little chance of these cuts healing much.**" Sera's implication - and warning - are clear. "**Business *before* pleasure, champ. At least for now.**"
The pair exchange knowing glances before Jason is deactivated for the night.<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

Jason Drexler awakes several hours later. His internal clock indicates Sera has been working most of the night and that it's now, in fact, early morning. A quick self-diagnostic reveals no unusual activity.
"**All charged up? Good.**" she says, having slipped into her "professional" demeanor. "**I ran a quick test last night to see if it works, and it does - you've now got yourself a bona fide scrambled restrainer bolt. Activating it isn't hard, it's in a subroutine you'll find in a second. You're looking at ten or fifteen minutes before they discover you're missing - that's the typical cycle on personnel check. The bolt runs on internal power though, so you'll be able to stay that way as long as you like. Of course if anyone *else* tries to scan it they'll discover the anomaly as well, but I don't think you'll have much time to stop and chat.**"
Sera steps back from Jason, allowing him to stand and take a look at her handiwork. Most of his synthskin wounds have been healed overnight thanks to copious amounts of bacta and rest.

**"Pleasing to the eye and not a meatbag! Well this is a stroke of good fortune I'm having today"** The droid offered after learning his counterpart's true nature. Upon hearing the details on how the restraining bolt could be scrambled, his mechanical heart lifted and he agreed that it was for the best to be deactivated for the night to allow the healing salves to work their magic.

**"Look take the kid and get out of here, I'm not one to normally have a conscience, but I just don't kill the young. Especially those that are *gifted*. I had hoped you and your son wouldn't be here when I delivered my message. But that's not how things seem to transpire."** An Iridonian figure spoke wrapped in simple black robes, his arm reached out, holding stack of credit chips. **"That should be enough to cover your new life away from here."**
The woman still clutching her child with one hand, took the money with the other and squirrelled it away within her robes. She still wore a look of utter horror on her face as moments before she'd witnessed the cowled figure burst into the room whirling a crimson blade and hew down the mercenaries she'd hired as protection, before stopping in his tracks upon seeing the woman and child. The appartment palace was lavish, rightly so, her husband was a well respected local politician, but he'd run out of cash and ... luck. The iridonian had been told to send a message and that he did.
He passed the woman a datapad. **"That contains the docking information of a transport that can get you offworld, and your son into safety of others like him."** He continuing to talk for a few minutes, outlining the detailed information of the plan and who she would need to speak to, before pulling up his cowl and turning away from the couple. **"…oh and by the way, you only have four standard minutes to leave this place before it's rubble."**
Pulling back his sleeve, the Iridonian gave a wrist mounted device a few taps and a black speed materialised outside the window overlooking the city planet. Its roof slid back to reveal the jet black interior. Another few taps on the device, and a sonic pulse was emitted in the locale, shattering anything wasn't dense enough to withstand the wave, the massive plexiglass viewport included.
The woman still stoof there clutching her son, like a womp rat in a Corruscant Taxi's headlights.
**"Three minutes and forty standard seconds…..thirty nine….thirty eight."**
She scrambled to her feet and headed for the ride outside, before being told to go the other way. Holding her son's hand she broke into a run, dragging him behind her as she headed for the exit.
The iridonian lept into the speeder and the blacked-out roof closed behind him, shielding him from sight. He immediately pushed his speeder into a nose dive, bottoming out into a space lane below, moments before a massive explosion wracked the area. His image flickered for a second, reverting to a human male in tight fitting fitness wear before back to its iridonian mask.
---
When he awoke he was greeted by Sera with her business face on and she quickly began to reel off the details of the scrambler she's done for the bolt.
*'Wow, she's been busy, must have worked through the night!'* He thought notedly admiring her handiwork and giving her a nod of approval before performing a quick systems scan to find subroutine 35-C4P3.
**"As long as I can escape the reaches of whoever is controlling me, I'll be long gone before they notice *I'm* missing. The only problem is how I'm going to get you out of here aside from as spare parts…"** The droid pauses for a moment before activating his vocabulator again **"…that's if you want to elop—-escape with me."**
Clearing his throat, and dispelling the red blush that was crossing his face, Jason quickly got back to business. **"We'll need to get details of this place, possible escape routes, patrol paths, nearest cities with star ports et cetera. I think our best bet would mingling with the crowd after an arena match."**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I guess I'll need some rolls here. Planetary Information? I'm guessing a Knowledge(Galactic Lore/Bureaucracy) roll to find out local city info? Gather Information for the patrol routes and plans of the arena/palace layout or could my sensor package handle that? Maybe a use-computer to slice into a terminal (if one's handy) and obtain fight information? Transport information to and from Jabba' Arena? He's gpt to get all these guests here right?

</details>

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

So I'm thinking of two approaches. Either as Jabba comes down in his lift to pay his respects for me doing a bad job, I hop on it and take him hostage until I'm guaranteed safe passage. Not a very prudent move, since I'll probably end up dead or with a large bounty on my head. Or creep out at night/after a battle, just getting from Jabba's Arena (which I presume is near/in his Palace) to a major city (I think Bestine is closest, then it's a short ride on to Mos Eisley. But travel times between Jabba's and there? I have no idea on. Unless Jabba has a shuttle or a few swoop bikes laying around. Bestine was also if I remember the Imperial Capital of the planet, which might prove interesting lol)

Sera's eyes dart away at Jason's unintended words, but the two recover quickly at the mention of details.
"**The nearest obvious starport is Mos Eisley. It'll be easy to lose anyone there in the short-term and getting passage off-world won't be much trouble, with the right incentive. Credits aren't the only thing that counts on Tatooine but they do help. So that's what we can do once we get *out*. As for patrols and interior defenses - Jabba's palace is more like a fortress in many respects. You're right about the crowds though. You'd probably be alright with your holographic capabilities, but little ol' me…**" Sera lets the sentence trail off as she ponders the alternatives.
"**Hmm. Here's something else. Sometimes Jabba arranges for night matches. He has his favored fighters hunt down the unfortunate folks that owe him credits. Usually it's only two or three combatants but whenever he has more than that he likes to give the 'defenders' a head start across the desert. They're then tracked down and dispatched - all broadcast over the vidscreens in the arena. It's a big night for bets, and there's usually more than one major player around…**" again letting her words hang will she taps away on her datapad. "**Okay, the next one's scheduled for tomorrow night. Some Rodian swoop gang that seems to have earned Jabba's wrath will be 'competing' against some bounty hunters.**"
Sera puts down the datapad and looks at Jason, raising an eyebrow and placing her hands on her hips: "**You up for a date, champ?**"

The two share a light-hearted moment but are cut short as the sound of Jabba's platform can be heard rising into place. The young Twi'lek addresses Jason from his place next to the Hutt:
"**Jason Drexler - you have fought well but the illustrious Jabba was not impressed. You are about to face a group of non-organic constructs purchased from our associates on Raxus Prime. Make the battle last - for your own sake.**"

It doesn't take long for Jason's announcement to be drown out by the sound of his opponents: Two behemoth junk droids. They resemble each other only in size and rough bipedal design - everything else seems to be little more than thrown together components from whatever mechanical parts could be found during assembly. Full droid chassis can be seen, hidden among durasteel plating and other, less identifiable features. Jason's appearance brings an array of cheers from the packed crowd, but not as much as he would've expected given his last match. Clearly he *isn't* the favored contender.
"***Welcome one and all once more to the Dune Arena! Today the Great Jabba has decided to prove Jason Drexler's worth against not one but two giants of Raxus Prime!***"
Now the typical sounds of the audience begin: cheers, jeers, and everything in between. Jason's eyes have already spotted what the Twi'lek announcer goes on to mention for the sake of those seated too far away to see for themselves.
"***…but our beloved Jabba Desilijic Tiure is not wholly without compassion. He has provided some powerful weapons that our latest champion may avail himself of in this epic battle…***" Holographic images appear in the air above the arena of the missile launcher and it's ammunition and float down to hover for a brief moment directly over the weapons themselves. A gong rings out over the sound system and the match begins, a flurry of drones covering it from all angles once more.

The reaction to Jason's appeals ranges from ecstatic support to intense hatred and disgust to an apathetic minority. He checks the clip of the weapon in his hands and discovers two missiles, ready to fire. The launcher itself seems ordinary with one notable exception: some strange markings and a device located just under the barrel.
The two metal monsters power up their motivators and begin to circle around the columns, taking up flanking positions on Jason. Large glowing eyes stare at him from deep within the dark recess of the droids' optic sockets. They remain quiet though, studying this curious little opponent like a hunter studies prey...

Whether because of Jason's taunt or some other primitive hunting technique, the two metal monstrosities let out a mechanical bellow that shakes the Dune Arena walls - almost as much as the weight of their massive frames do when they suddenly charge into flanking positions on the comparitively tiny droid champion. They pause, recalibrating motivators and calculating an appropriate attack method now that the little target has acquired some weaponry:

**"Shut it! I'm the only one allowed to speak round here!"** The increasingly irate droid yelled as he trained his scope on one of the behemoths, firing off one of the rockets. Not even looking to see if it had hit he already headed for cover. Swiftly moving back towards the stone pillars.

The missile strikes true and the explosion sends metal fragments soaring in all directions, but the beast is simply too big to be be affect much. The pair of gigantic junk droids move in for the kill, and one reaching striking distance. A massive metal fist is drawn back, ready to pound Jason into scrap that not even Sera would have any hope of repairing. The swing falls short though, and other than a strong breeze, the champ is unaffected.
The crowd goes berserk at both the first hit of the match and the subsequent miss by the behemoth.

As the titans loom towards him, Jason is satisfied to see that one of his shots was true and had sent shards of burning metal across the sand.

This time the missile flies wide and almost strikes the stands - but suddenly falls to the pit floor harmless as it leaves the wall's perimeter. Apparently Jabba doesn't like his combatants to get to cocky. The weapon chirps to indicate its ammunition has been depleted.
The two metal giants continue pursuit of Jason, their footfalls sending minor quakes throughout the entire arena. The nearest one swipes at Drexler with a jagged mechanical claw that looks more like it belongs in some sort of loading bay than on any droid, but the champ is far too nimble. The claw slams into the stone column over Jason's head, adding to the rubble already on the ground at its base. The crowd cheers for the impending results - this match won't last much longer, whoever triumphs.

The missile attack may have missed but Jason takes advantage of the outstretched arm of his lumbering opponent to land a jab before breaking for the rocket magazine on the pedestal nearby. Unfortunately for him, he makes an easy target with his back turned and the junk droid smashes a claw straight into Jason's legs. The attack lifts him off the ground and throws him a couple meters - fortunately in the direction of the waiting missile clip. He's able to close the remaining distance quickly but the junk droids seem confident in a victory and are content to play with their food a while longer.
Jabba's menacing laughter can be heard over the arena's sound system, a sure sign that he's pleased with the match so far...

Jason was flung through the air and came crashing down a short distance from the missiles. *'Well….I guess that's a spot of luck'* He thought as his diagnostic systems started to flash red and warnings streamed across his vision. Slamming the magazine into the missile launcher, he began to calibrate the weapon with it's new load. *'Damnit, this is taking too long.'*
Using his encrypted comlink, Jason picks up the signal of Sera's datapad and sends her a binary message: **"I'm gonna need you to buy me some time, a few seconds should be enough. This isn't looking good. I'm on one of the platforms*."**

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-09 12:36:14)

Watching the match from the relative safety of one of the corridors below the stands, Sera sees Jason's opponents gaining the advantage rapidly. Small trails of dust fall from the cieling as the junk droids maneuver about the pit. She shudders as the droid boxer is lifted off his feet only to land a few meters away, scrambling for some additional ammunition.
The comm from Jason comes at just the right time - she's near a junction box for the arena's main power supply. Sera wastes no time in smashing the panel with all her might. The vidscreens located throughout the entire complex flicker momentarily and the broadcast drones fall suddenly to the ground. That probably would've been a distraction enough to gain Jason the time he needed, but then the platform he's on shoots upward about ten meters - smashing one of the junk droids in the face and lifting Jason well out of harm's reach for the time being. The metal beast's roar can be heard clearly over security alarms that have begun to blare and Sera does her best to avoid detection by returning to her station.
The platform's unexpected acceleration pins Jason to its surface for a moment, after which he's able to reload the missile launcher with a full four-round clip. Already the pillar is descending gradually though, and while one of the giants is recovering from the unorthodox attack the other eyes him greedily, ready to exact revenge.

I'm not going to redo a map for this round since the only thing that changed is Behemoth 1 moves down 1 space. At the end of this next round the platform will be back to ground level.

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-10 14:01:47)

Jason scrambles to get a bead on the already damaged junk droid and fires - his mark hitting true. Large portions of the behemoth fall to the ground and there's little doubt he'll be gone before the match is over. The champ sprints to the arena wall in an attempt to gain a better defensive position but the recovering mechanical menace swings a gleaming claw straight to Jason's mid-section in a hope to cleave him in two.
The attack catches Drexler's body and slams him into the wall, damaged but not out of the fight by a longshot. Another quick jab and he's able to send even more machine parts spilling to the pit floor. The further junk droid approaches cautiously, content to let his wounded partner take the brunt of Jason's attacks for now...

The world began to spin as Jason took another massive hit. He was surprised he was still standing after the amount of subsystems he saw shut down and divert their run time to keeping him alive.
*'Shall not fail….'*
The droid stood like a battered prize fight - Well he was; No, he still is - his arm and right hand side of his body hung limply, too tired (and far too damaged) to lift them and hold them in the correct posture. But he still had fight left in him, and shot at the heavily damaged droid, hoping that the explosion if it blew would be enough of a distraction for him to distract the other droid temporarily

Jason's second missile finally fells the metal beast and the sound of metal grinding and collapsing is overcome only by it's final roar for vengeance. It's massive frame slams to the pit floor in a fire-filled explosion that sends parts flying through the entire Dune Arena. The remaining behemoth is happy to retaliate but Jason is also able to maximize on the distraction of the explosion and hides, undetected, among the smoldering ruins of his first victim. His comm goes unanswered though, and the reason is soon discovered...
"***Jason!***" shouts Sera, thrown into the pit from a side hatch. She's obviously been beaten, her clothes full of tears and her face bleeding from several small cuts and bruises. The second junk droid moves to all fours and races around the perimeter of the arena, anxious at the prospect of another toy to play with - one with far less bite.

A look of horror shoots across Jason's face as his mechanical counterpart is thrown into the fray, providing ample distraction for the remaining behemoth.
**"Concerned statement: Are…you ok? Aroused flattery: I would say you look even better, but now isn't the right time.

There's no way I'm going down!"**
Using the distraction to his advantage, Jason's damage control unit is able to kick into play and numerous subsystems come back online as his visuals flicker under the momentary reboot.
Training his rocket on the back of the bounding behemoth, Jason shouts at it before firing off another shot as he body round from behind the molten carcass.

Jason's missile catches the shoulder of the of the junk droid, knocking free a large panel that looks like hull plating on an LAAT, but the beast in undeterred. He round the corner and gains ground on Sera, who's already bolting for safety at Jason's side.
"**Sorry lover, no time for that right now,**" she shouts over the roar of her pursuer, "**I don't think they're done with the surprises…**"
The crowd is ecstatic at the unexpected addition to the match and the wagering frenzy begins anew. With so much going on it would seem impossible that anything else would be necessary to call the day a success for Jabba - no doubt this match alone was making him a small fortune in house bets. The vidscreens go blank once more, however, and the Hutt's fat face appears. In his guttural Huttese he begins to address Jason Drexler personally:
"**I see now why you were so costly to me, little boxer. I may have some use for you yet - if you survive…***" he ends with a slow sinister laugh and the spectators cheer at what Jabba's comment could mean.

Sera reaches down deep and manages to find the will to keep going. She tries to put as much distance between the junk droid and herself as possible but the tactic won't work forever. Her motivators have already begun to freeze up.
But the behemoth has the cold persistence of a digital mind and exists for a single goal - to win. He cuts through the columns in the center of the arena, optics trained on the young Falleen-shaped droid fleeing for her life.

The missile streaks through the air towards its target - the sole remaining giant from Raxus Prime. Distracted by his pursuit of Sera, the behemoth junk droid is unprepared for the round to strike home as effectively as it does. It enters under the jagged shoulder armor on his right arm and detonates, sending flame and parts showering down to the pit floor below. The beast rears back and bellows in a close approximation of digital pain as the entire limb falls in sudden jerking motions, cables and servos ripped from the main chassis socket. It lays clenching in the last throws of animation in the thick dirt of the arena floor.
The beast turns his large glowing eyes slowly to meet Jason's gaze as Sera continues her flight. With the sound of innumerable gears grinding and metal buckling under so much internal damage it reaches down to pick up its severed appendage with its remaining hand. Standing tall and pulling back to the point that integral cables and wiring can be heard snapping at the strain, he launches the massive limb directly at Jason Drexler.
There are no words in any known language to describe the current level of frenzy displayed by those in the stands.

Jason really did not expect his missile to have such success as the limb of the juggernaut is blown to the ground. He looks at the launcher with a nod of appreciation, its magazine now spent, before tossing it into the smouldering wreckage behind him and playing up for the crowd.
**"Ok ok….what are the bets on me now, huh? I'll put ten thousand credits on me to win."** He says, his arrogance now back in full flow, as he waved a credit chip at the crowd. **"Any take–"**
His sensors started flashing wildly detecting something of meteorological proportions heading his way at full speed. With the honed reflexes of the fighter that he was, he pushed off the wreckage behind him and slid underneath the various scrap thrown together to act as a limb as it shot casually overhead. The impact against the arena wall sent a shower of oil into the vicinity before being simultaneously combusted by a myriad of sparks, resulting in an inferno worthy of note. Any spectators looking over the wall would have either found themselves in a bacta tank or at the hairdressers the next day.
The battlefield, as it essentially had become, was now a complete state, scraps from any known droid now scattered it. Jason chuckled as he noted the domed top of an r2 unit half buried in the morass. *'Those things were never built for real combat…'* With the flames now roaring behind him, from the behemoths perspective, Jason looks like a billboard for the latest action holomovie. "Drexler: The ~~Under~~OverDog's Story 4D"
Casually moving over to Sera, he tells her to stay behind him as the behemoth was still a very real threat, before thanking her for her assistance earlier and reassuring her that it was all nearly over.
**"Like my last match….The choice is your's to make, fans! Is this monstrocity worthy of saving? Or should I end it's misery?"** He posed the question once more, his clenched fist once again outstretched.
