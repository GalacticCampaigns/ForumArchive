# [Commandos of the Republic] Chapter 1: The Defense of Kamino

### **Mandalore89** (2009-07-07 19:50:52)

The gentle hum of the *Ascension's* engines as it races through hyperspace is suddenly pierced by an incoming call alarm on the intercom terminal. The on board barracks that shelters exhausted commando squads between missions it filled with its shrill sound until the terminal allows the call to auto connect. The viewscreen turns on and fills the big room with bright light illuminating both of the squads that are currently sleeping in their bunks. The viewscreen then shows a familiar face. It is Lieutenant Tac, a one of the few clone bridge officers aboard this Acclamator. "Sorry to wake you up considering you just returned but only 3 standard hours ago," he says sounding sincerely apologetic, "But Senior General Zey requested to speak to you immediately. I believe he has a new mission of dire importance that requires your skills. He is currently waiting on the holocomm in the briefing room on the command deck."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Both Adenn squad and Orar squad are asleep on their bunks in this barracks after having completed prior missions.*

"Bloody Typical!" Exclaims Fifty as he rolls off his bunk, almost landing on the floor but ultimately managing to get himself upright. He glanced around the room at the other Commandos before stepping briskly to the door, and heading through the ship to the command room. He scratches his upper back as he walks, looking at the hurrying mechanics and guard details, wondering what exactly this news could be.

The alarm pumps a jolt of adrenaline into Res who bolts upright, grogginess temporarily suspended. When he realizes it's just a mission briefing and not an attack a soft groan escapes his lips. *Shab*. It had been a good sleep, he was too tired for the nightmares.
Hopping down from his bunk Res gets dressed quickly. With a yawn he looks up at Tac, "Not your fault sir."
Once dressed he heads towards the door but waits for his squad. "Come on *vode*, shift it. We don't want to keep the General waiting now do we?"

"Keep your shiny, white shirt on, *alor*." Shiv says as he gets dressed. "This ain't the first time we've been woken early and it sure as *haran* ain't gonna be the last." He dons his *Katarn*-class battle armor, but carries his helmet rather than but it on. Finally, sheathing his trusty vibroblade, he follows his fellows to the command deck, saying, "Well, off to see the general, eh?"

## Re: Ch 1. Defense of Kamino

### **Mandalore89** (2009-07-07 21:08:24)

At Res's and Shiv's comments, Lieutenant Tac replies "I do suggest you hurry. The general seems to be quite anxious." and then shuts off the comm.
The comm alarm had caused Twitch to jump and up reach for the blaster pistol he keeps under his pillow. While Blitz just silently gets ups and begins getting dressed in a hurried fashion. Twitch says "Shab. The sarge is in a hurry. Hey Blitz, lets just go back to sleep and *let Fifty report back to us*." he says with a chuckle as he replaces his blaster. As Blitz passes Twitch out the door, he gives him a seemingly hard but playful punch to the shoulder and says "No reason to make him any more angry than he normally is. You want one of his rockets up your shebs?" Twitch cringes at the thought and hastily gets dressed and rushes out to follow Blitz and Shiv.

Al'verde looked around as he opened his eyes **"Megin te haran?"** As he eyes adjusted he calmly rolled out of bed **"Haar'chak there's hardly enough time to take a haalas let alone get some nuhoyir"** he said as he threw one of his black shirts on and walked out the door. He took a deep breath in as he started to walk and then broke out into a run to catch up to the others. It only took him a moment to catch up to Fifty and the others **"Well this is what we get for being ori'ramikad"** he smiled as he slowed down glancing at his brothers

Kuur hears the alarm and rolls over in his bunk, moaning into his pillow.
"Sir? I realize that our great and glorious Jedi generals can make do with less sleep than the average human, and so can we, but I still need *some* sleep."
Continuing to moan, but getting out of bed none the less and strapping the plates to his body suit, Kuur looked around at the others.
Having finished strapping on his armor and placing his weapons in their spots, he turns towards Fifty.
"Ner vod, ni gaa brokar Jetii. Lise ni?"

Fifty laughed as Kuur spoke to him, responding without turning to face him.
"Ni mirdir te Jetii ramaania, Tion'jor vod?"
Fifty stops for a moment, noticing the others had decided to put their armour on, whilst he was only wearing shorts. "We're safe here men, no need to wear that armour, unless you invite trouble," he says in Basic this time, for the benefit of the non Mando'a speaking crew.

Finishing locking the plates into place, Kuur turned from the group and headed out the room, helmet tucked under one arm, pistol sitting on his hip in its holster, BlasTech DLT-20A slung over his shoulder, bandolier across his chest.
Looking back through the door, Kuur said to the others,
"Oya, vode."

Sigma opens his eyes slowly as he hears the alarm going off. He rolls off his bunk and starts strapping on his armor. He is in total auto-pilot mode his body just working off reflex more than any sort of instruction from his mind. He listens quietly to the conversation but when Fifty pipes up with not needing the armor he smiles a little.
"It is better to have it and not need it than it is to need it and not have it Fifty."

"Well I don't know about you, But I don't think I'll need it anyway! Haha, bloody clankers can't hit the broadside of a barn, s'why I make sure I don't eat so much. No need to present a bigger target eh?" Joked Fifty as he glanced at the heavy kitbag which held his red marked armour, he then decided just to check his wrist rocket launcher. He'd received it from on of his Mandalorian trainers, and preferred it over the DC15 or 17, besides, he could always hold his pistol and still have a missile at the ready.
The lid of the box came away with a click and the polished launcher lay on a foam interior, a smaller case within held some of the darts. Content that his weapon hadn't been touched, he left the room again.
(ok, assume that this speaking happened before fifty left the room a few posts ago..)

As the group turns the corner to reach the turbolift to the command tower, a young human naval officer that seems to be in a hurry collides with the group as he runs around the corner. Being much smaller than the clones, he bounces rather violently off of Kuur's breastplate and falls back onto his backside. As soon as he shakes his head clear, he stands up in a hurry and seems ready to chastise you until he realizes he is standing in front of 8 commandos. He immediately becomes flustered and attempts to come up with an appropriate reprimand, but all that comes out is "Watch where you're going you frakking clones." You can't help but notice the contempt he seems to have towards you as he immediately realizes the mistake he made as he makes an effort to circumvent your group and get to where he is headed.

Res watches the exchange with an irritated scowl. Was this their fate, to serve for the rest of their short lives under aruetiise that hated them? Kuur's response jolts him out of his philosophical musing. "Udesii vod! Nu kaysh kando." The man might be a jerk but he was still a superior officer and could cause them trouble. Thank the Manda they've never meet an officer who speaks Mando'a.
Res gives the offending officer a stony glare then hits the turbolift button. When the doors open he indicates the lift with a nod of his head and steps in. "K'olaro vode. Mhi ganar bora vaabir."

The turbolift takes you up directly up to the command deck just aft of the bridge. From there you proceed on onto the briefing room. As the doors slide open, you see a giant room with a massive holodisplay of a familiar system. Considering the amount of time you spent in that system, you immediately recognize it as the Kamino system. Surrounding the display are several high ranking figures including the Lieutenant Tac and the *Ascension's* captain, Captain Kalhad. Next to Captain Kalhad is a hologram of Senior Jedi General, Arligan Zey. They seems to be talking about the Kamino System in great detail. On the opposite side of the holomap is a clone who is wearing a jumpsuit and has a patch on his arm that denotes him as a pilot. As you walk into the room, the hologram of Zey turns to you and says "Ah, glad to see you could finally make it gentlemen. Please have a seat." as he motions an arms towards the seats surrounding the holomap. As you sit down, the doors to the room open once again and a human female in Jedi robes enters the room. Zey turns to her and says "You're late Kyaka." and then faces the commandos and says "Men, meet your new general. Kyaka will is taking command of Alpha Group of the S.O.B. (Special Operations Brigade)."

Fifty took a seat as the Jedi entered the room and laughed a little, "If I knew we were meeting a jedi i'd be fully dressed!" Noticing the pilot Fifty wondered if they were in fact going to be leaving soon.. Maybe he should have put his armour on, "At least I won't get a sore arse just from sitting down eh squad"

Al'verde looked back at the seat but remained standing. As he looked at his brothers he leaning against the wall and adjusted his shirt. He looked at the jedi as she walked in and let out a small sigh *Well she's already late, so that's one thing we'll have to see is normal* he thought as he kept glancing around. He knew he was safe in here but he was always told to be aware of his surroundings and some thing you never switch off.

The pilot clone watches the commandos enter with a smile on his cleanshaven face. A feeling of importance rose in his chest. True, he was nowhere near the same level as these men, but still to work with them was an immense honor.
He remained silent, but couldn't help giving a slight wave of greeting as the commandos entered.

Kyaka Mentak wasn't wearing Jedi robes, But instead rarely seen Jedi Battle Armor. (any sufficiently techie type could see its been modified with Shadowskin.) and seemed comfortable in it. What possessions she owned seems to be stashed within her utility belt, and two lightsabers hung from her belt.
"My Shuttle was Delayed, Master Zey." She offers as an explanation, offering a polite bow to the hologram. She turned and looked over the Commandos with a critical eyes, as if trying to get a feeling from them all, but finding mostly disapproval. "Please continue with your briefing, Master."

Fifty nods as the Jedi makes her excuse, "Sir, what's wrong with Kamino?" having spent much of his life on the watery world, Fifty was concerned with the holographic images of the planet, "I suppose this is more important than us going back for training, right?" He scratches his neck as he notices the Jedi's armour, was that shadowskin?
*Now why couldn't we get that kind of gear?..*

"We have information that Kamino is the target of an imminent Separatist attack." says Senior General Zey. "Captain Maze has just returned from speaking with General Vos so I'll let him explain."
Then a second person steps into view in the hologram. You immediately recognize him as an *Alpha*-class ARC trooper. He is in full battle gear complete with his shoulder pauldron and battle kama. He removes his helmet and clips it to the back of his belt. He then pulls out a datapad and says "General Vos has come across some information while undercover on the Wheel. It seems that the Separatists think that the best way to end the war early is to strike at the heart of our clone production, Kamino." He touches something offscreen and the holomap in the room widens to show the entire Kamino system. "I have come across some reliable info that suggests the attack will occur within the next 10 standard hours and that the Seps are committing a whole fleet to the assault." He then types something into his datapad and suddenly tiny red-colored representations of Separatist ships begin to appear on the holomap. "A strategy for a surprise counterattack has already been developed so I will turn it back over to Senior General Zey to explain." says Maze as he steps offscreen.
"Thank you Captain." says Zey. He then motions to the holomap saying "These represent where we think the Separatists will exit hyperspace..." He then motions offscreen and tiny blue representations of GAR ships appear on the opposite side of the planet from the Separatists and another group of GAR ships appear at the far end of the holomap behind the last planet in the system. "..and these represent where our Open Circle Fleet will be waiting." "Once the Separatists have entered the system, Battle Groups Omega and Gamma will circle the planet and use fighter screens to prevent them from landing any troops." As he says this, the tiny blue ships do exactly what he had just stated. "Then Battle Groups Epsilon and Beta will micro-jump in from the edge of the system to pummel them from the backside," and the tiny blue ships jump across the holomap. "However, the fighter screens, even with the help of General Skywalker, will not be able to contain all of the enemy landers. Orar it is your job to board their droid control ship and disable its control towers."
"However, I have another mission for Adenn." he says as he turns towards the Clones. "We believe that this fleet is under the direct command of Commander Merai, a veteran of the Quarren War" As he says this the holoprojector changes to display a big picture of a male Mon Calamarian. "He has recently been enlisted by the Confederacy and we need him back." "He knows key information that could hinder us in the long run." "Adenn it is your job to bring him back alive." "You will be accompanied by General Mentak," says Zey as he motions towards her. "She will help with the retrieval." "Luckily, Merai's flagship, the *Insurrection*, is the fleet's droid control ship, so both squads can be inserted with the same ship" and a *Lucrehulk*-class Droid Control Ship with Confederacy markings is brought up on the hologram. "You will insert via space through the outer hull near back side of the core ship." He then motions to the Clone pilot, "Oddball here will be your pilot."
"Any questions men or Kyaka?"

Kuur raised his eyebrow at the Jedi's comments.
*A Jedi with enough sense, first off, to wear armor. Shadowskin even. And to top it off, she's smart enough to ask for extra munitions. I'd always thought that the desk generals were more concerned with war on budget than getting the job done. Maybe this Jedi's worth some respect after all.*
Kuur raised his hand.
"Excuse me, general, but on top of what was just asked, I would like to ensure that we are being equipped with environmental seals for our space-walk onto the ship after we're dropped off. That is, unless Oddball here can pilot us into the ship's main hangar directly."

Facing Kyaka, Zey says" Yes we do have schematics for *Lucrehulk*-class Droid Control Ships but considering it is Merai's flagship it is bound to have added defenses that we may not know about."
He then turns partially to Kurr so he can address both him and the Jedi and says" After this meeting you will need to go to the *Ascension's*  armory so you can acquire the necessary munitions. Also, unless I'm mistaken your newly upgraded armor should have vacuum seals and life support systems to support you for 10 hours in cold space. Kyaka, you can grab a simple flight suit to put on over your armor. However, it will be unlikely that you will be able to fly directly into the hangar considering the type of protection it will have. There is also the possibility that the hangar doors may not be open considering the ship will have most likely launched all its droids by the time you arrive. So you will need explosive charges to break through the hull and magnetic boots so you don't fly off into space."

Res sits through most of the briefing quietly, rarely do the others fail to ask all the questions on his mind. When the Jedi enters he can't help but stare out the side of his helmet, that way the direction of his gaze won't be obvious. He's usually only seen them in holograms and never this close in the flesh. Res didn't expect to see one wearing armor but she looked comfortable in it. Maybe it was a sign of solidarity with the troops, he'd heard some Jedi were like that. Suddenly a thought occurs to him, what if she could somehow sense he was staring at her?! Glad no one could see him blush he forces himself to pay more attention to General Zey and the briefing.
When their pilot is introduced Res nods in greeting as well as respect. It's impressive that he understands Mando'a. Most space jockeys just stare at them like they've grown bug wings when they speak it. At the mention of extra kit he perks up, switching to the squad frequency with a click of his tongue. "Ohh Mag boots! Tion mhi taylir, ruus'alor?"

Zey turns to Al'verde and says "Unfortunately we do not have spare jetpacks for you. However, once close enough, the magnetic boots you will be provided will secure you to the hull. It is Oddball's job to get the ship close enough while avoiding enemy fire so that there shouldn't be any error in your insertion."
He thens looks at Sigma and says, "A dossier on Commander Merai will be forwarded to you along with the schematics for a droid control ship. We expect the attack within the next 10 standard hours. Captain Kalhad will have the ship meet up with rest of Battle Group Epsilon in the Kamino system directly after this meeting. Both squads are to be prepped for insertion within 4 standard hours just in case the Separatists attack before we expect."
Captain Kalhad then says, "Once you are fully geared up, proceed to hangar bay 4 and meet with Oddball. That is where your modified Laat/i will be waiting."
Senior General Zey then looks at each one of the clones in turn and says, "Any more questions?"

Then pressing the button to sever the connection, and turning to address the Commandos. "The Defense of Kamino is the responsibility of Anakin and his forces, We need to focus on our mission.
"If I remember correctly didn't you all just return from a mission?" She asked, "Get in 5 hours of sleep, then catch a hot meal before suiting up."

Ho boy, "shouldn't be", well *that's* comforting. Despite the odds though Res was confident, if Oddball said he could do it than he could. No clone would exaggerate his abilities when his brothers' lives were on the line.
Their new general has given them an order and Res is not about to point out that it's in conflict with Zey's. Jumping up out of his chair he offers Kyaka an enthusiastic salute, "Yes ma'am!". If she wanted to get on their good sides this seems like a good way to do it. "Come on *vode*, let's go."

Kuur knows that Droid Control Ships house 2 main banks of droid brains. The first bank is Central Control Computer. It is in tasked with sorting through and processing incoming information, formulating commands, and then broadcasting them to the Battle Droid armies. The second bank is the Ship Processing Computer. This computer bank is wired throughout the entire ship and it charged with dealing with the avionics, power distribution and other necessary things during a naval conflict. Considering the amount of droid brain power in the *Lucrehulk*-class Droid Control Ship, Kuur thinks that the slicing into even an outer hull airlock would be rather difficult but not entirely impossible considering his skills. (It would just take time and initial failure could lead to dire consequences)
(*I know that I didn't give you a DC, but I not quite sure where I could find standard DC's (Will Defense) for hacking a ship's computer. If someone knows please tell me, otherwise I've come up with something I'm going to use but I need to check and make sure it is fair.*)

Fifty nods as the jedi speaks, and stands up, saluting Kyata, "So, are you a General or Commander?" Fifty racked his mind for a few moments, trying to formulate a plan of action to undertake after insertion. He had 3 men under his command, maybe more if the Jedi tagged along. They'd have an entire droid army on them once inside if they weren't careful, maybe splitting up would be beneficial, allowing them to target different controllers simultaeneously.

## Re: Chapter 1: The Defense of Kamino

### **Mandalore89** (2009-07-10 18:07:40)

By looking at the schematics he has been forwarded, Fifty is positive that the *Insurrection* will have improved defenses compared to the control ships of ten years earlier. (The Trade Federation learned their mistake at the Battle of Naboo) The control ship is not only key to the occupation of Kamino, it is also their fleet's flagship. So now the ship's reactors are more effectively shielded against explosives from outside and inside the ship. Also considering the shield strength of a *Lucrehulk*-class Control Ship, the only effective way to quickly neutralize the droid control computer is to take it out from the inside with explosives. The personnel that operate the controllers are situated on the bridge of the ship but they are not necessary for its function. The Central Control Computer will need to be knocked out to render the droid army useless. Its very likely that extra security measures (such as locked blast doors and extra droid security) are in place around it. Also, the droid brains are split into 3 different locations in the mid-level decks of the Core ship and all 3 must be taken out to put the computer offline.
Initially, splitting up may help in circumventing droid security but if one commando gets caught alone then they are in big trouble. However, once Fifty's team is inside the inner workings of the Core Ship and through the outer levels of the security, splitting up would allow the 3 different droid brain banks of the control computer to be destroyed more quickly.

"I prefer my name, but whichever your comfortable with." Kyata replies, when one of the Commandos inquired as to how she should be addressed. She then looks over the men, "Do you have names? or just numbers?"
This was the first time Kyata, had something approaching a personal conversation with any of the clones. General Vos didn't even want to know if a particular clone, and only addressed them by number when he addressed them at all. Kyata didn't see how they were any different then the volunteer Militia she trained with while waiting to undergo her Jedi Trials.

Kuur had not been listening to the conversation going on around him very well. Instead he'd been sliding data card after data card into his gauntlet computer, with the holographic images hovering over it showing a sequence of ship schematics of a droid control ship, coupled with the schematics of the computers. His face grew increasingly sour as it was obvious that he was getting pissed off with each passing data card, throwing the discarded ones onto the table like useless, broken toys.
"Haar'chak! ... HAAR'CHAK! ... **HAAR'CHAK!**"

Knowing that he wouldn't stand a chance of hacking a droid ship's computer with his current level of skill and gear makes Kuur more upset as he goes through more data cards, confirming his theory. He can't slice the droid ship open for his brothers. He'll have to blow it open, and that means that the ship will be alerted to their presence, and that means that more clones might die. And **that** means that he will have failed again.
Well, osik'la! He had no intentions of letting his brothers down again. If he couldn't get them in quietly, then he'd get them in well armed and protected, and they'd simply have to kill every stinking droid on the ship.

He stood up and faced the Jedi, "I'll be back later ma'am," he said before saluting and leaving to head back to the dorm.
When he arrives he goes about carefully donning his personally coloured Katarn class armour. The shoulders were stained a deep red and the chest had various markings.

For those that make their way down to the armory, they find a multitude of the weapons, armors and equipment available for the troops on board the *Ascension*. Of course there are the standard issue items: DC-15 rifles (plus all of its variations), DC-17 sidearms, multiple sets of clone trooper armor (plus all of its variations) and even spare armor plates to replaced damaged ones. There are also magnetic boots and flight suits (normally used for outer hull repairs). There are also racks of grenades (both frag and ion) and boxes of heavy explosives (both detonite and explosive charges) as well as timers for them. There are racks with standard trooper gear of power packs, med pacs, utility belts, electrobinoculars and field kits. If one asks the officer in charge of the armory, Sergeant Meeda (a non-Clone human), about any extra gear, then he will take you to a back room where there are racks of non-GAR issued equipment. (This is where many of you got your weapons/equipment and where you acquire any spare parts to repair them) These racks contain about any weapon you can think of and most are restricted to civilians (probably where most of them were confiscated from).

He goes into a corner and begins rifling through some old durasteel boxes. Once he finds he seems to be looking for, he pulls it out of the pile and sets in upon a table. He opens the box and begins pulling out what appears to the pieces of broken slugthrowers. After inspecting each one and being unsatisfied, he puts them on the table. "Ah ha!" says Meeda as he pulls out a fairly old and dinged up pistol-sized slugthrower. "Its not in perfect shape and I'm quite sure it won't fire correctly unless you do some work on it. However, if you want it, it is all yours General." he says with a smile. "I hope that is ok?" *He seems over pleased that he found one and Kyata can feel in the Force that he hopes she appreciates it.*

Almost five hours pass as the commandos go about their business before they are needed in the hangar. Suddenly, a minor klaxon goes off announcing the *Ascension's* arrival into a gravity well and the ship jerks slightly as it is yanked out of hyperspace by a near by planet's gravity. The movement was more than enough to cause someone to stumble and the combination of it with the alarm wakes all of the sleeping commandos as they are jostled in their bunks.
And then, as if to just insure that Kuur was awake, his alarm goes off.

A couple of hours pass as the commandos prepare for the upcoming mission. Orar and Adenn are already situated around the modified LAAT/i in Hangar 4, making sure they are prepped with all the necessary gear. Blitz has been gathering his supplies and now sits on an empty plasteel crate as he stuffs his backpack with medpacs.Twitch has already prepared a bag full of explosive charges and detonite and now sits on the crate next to Blitz while tending to his blaster cannon.
Kuur has also gathered the necessary gear for his squad. He has gathered together enough explosives to crack a planet, maybe two. He has also had magnetic boots delivered for any fellow squad members that have not grabbed any yet. Also, crates of spare power packs, grenades (both frag and ion), and medpacs are set in a row near the LAAT/i so each commando can grab they own gear.
Oddball is running checks on the LAAT/i, attuning himself to the new additions.
*This LAAT/i has been modified specifically for insertions in space battles. The forward composite-beam turrets have been removed and replaced with additional hull plating and additional mass-driver missile launchers. The interior of the ship has been retrofitted with more advanced atmospheric containment shielding and heavier plating has been added to the passenger bay doors. The LAAT/i has been repainted a matte black in hopes of rendering it almost invisible during a space battle.*
As the squads are running some final checks on gear and weapons, a klaxon sounds over the *Ascension's* speakers. As the alarm continues to wail, Lieutenant Tac says over the ship's comm, "All men report to battle stations!" Before Tac had even finished speaking, the other Clones in the hangar scramble off to prepare for battle. Mechanics rush to prepare the V-wing squadrons for their pilots, gunners rush ammo carts to their respective stations and officers begin to shout out orders.
Tac then hails the commandos on their channel and says "Orar and Adenn, the Captain says to prepare for insertion after the micro-jump. Oddball have the larty ready to fly. You will be cleared to depart moments after our reversion to realspace."

"Ah, yes General it is. Please follow me." says Meeda as he walks towards another back room. Inside this room is what appears to be a workshop with a Clone in coveralls that are dirtied with at least three different types of lubricating fluid. He appears to be working on a disassembled E-Web that had blown a cooling line. As the Sergeant approaches, he looks up from his work, sees Kyata with the sarge and says "One moment," as he reaches under his workbench. He comes backs up with a newly polished MWC Enforcer and says, "Its seems that the firing pin had become misaligned. Probably due to a homemade slug." As he hands the weapon over to the Jedi, he says with a smile, "I refitted almost the whole entire chamber and firing mechanism. Shouldn't misfire anymore." As the clone gets back to work repairing the E-Web, the Sergeant leads Kyata back out to the armory. "I must attend to the ammo shipment to our mass-driver cannons now. However, if you need any more assistance please talk to one of the quartermasters." as he runs off to make sure ammo is getting to where its needed.

Sigma has eaten his full and is waiting around the hanger watching Kuur fret about the squads equipment. He knows better than to tell him he has already checked it three times. Like himself Kuur is the only surviving member of his squad to survive Geonosis. Kurr does this or something like it ever since before a mission. Sigma is glad he does it makes him feel better as well. He is startled out of his musing by the alarm and the oerder "All men report to battle stations!"
Tac then hails the commandos on their channel and says "Orar and Adenn, the Captain says to prepare for insertion after the micro-jump. Oddball have the larty ready to fly. You will be cleared to depart moments after our reversion to realspace."
Sigma responds
"Roger That! Lets go Adenn lets load up and get going this war isn't gonna win itself."

Already having packed his explosives into his pack, Kuur had made sure that all the supplies for his brothers had been set out in advance.
Hearing the alarm go off, Kuur simple slipped his mag boots on and double checked all seals and gear, going over his weapons one last time.
*Better to spend a few extra minutes being prepared than to get there and realize I've forgotten the charges.*
Hearing Res, Kuur turns his head and nods. "Ba'gedet'ye." <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

As Adenn squad began running up and getting their gear, Kuur went over each one to make sure his brothers had their seals set and their magboots prepared. He wasn't going to let anyone die today. Not today.

As the two squads are loading up, Clones rush around the hangar as two squadrons of V-19 Torrents are loaded up onto the circulating launch racks. Once the squadrons are in place, Clone pilots in fully sealed pilot armor enter their respective crafts and begin to warm up their engines while running last minute ship diagnostics. Considering all of the commotion on the deck of Hangar 4, no one noticed the slight jerk as the *Ascension* jumped to hyperspace and then quickly reverted to realspace. The only real indication that the ship had even jumped to Kamino was the familiar resounding *whump-whump-whump* of the turbolaser batteries as they fired their first salvo. As a response to the turbolasers salvo the ship rocked hard several times, as though turbolasers from a counter salvo were being absorbed by the Acclamator's deflector shields.
Moments later, the V-19 squadrons are carried on their racks to the ventral hangar opening and are released through the magnetic containment field one right after another.
Lieutenant Tac then says to Oddball through the larty's comm, "Oddball, prepare for launch. You will be cleared for departure after the launch of the next two V-19 squadrons. They will run interference for you until they hit the *Insurrection's* fighter screen. Then, you are on your own."

As Kuur finishes ensuring that his brothers are all sealed in and ready to go, he climbs into the larty and straps himself into the engineer's terminal at the back. Having finished strapping in, he turns on the unit frequency.
"Oddball, I've logged into the terminal back here. You just focus on piloting, vod. I'll keep this beauty running."
Turning back towards Kyata, Kuur glances at her straps, to make sure that she's secure.

He then looks forward, concentrating on the V-19's as they launch.

All her weapons were currently being worn inside the flightsuit, as she'd have to discard it once they were within the environment of the CIS battleship.
"Fifty, Sigma," She calls out to the Squad leaders. "Fifty, Leave two of your team here to cover Oddball and the Larty. I don't like the idea of not having a ride home. Sigma, Please have Kuur go with Fifty's team, they'll need the munitions more then we will, on the bridge."

Kyata can't see his face through the helmet but she can tell by his body movements and through the Force that he is offended.
Twitch speaks up too, saying, "Blitz and Fifty are absolutely right. Besides, I've got my own stash of charges," as he pats his armor's backpack." He then motions at Kuur and continues saying, "I may not know the intricacies of demolitions and computers like him, but I definitely know how to blow down blast doors."

As the LAAT/i speeds through the electromagnetic containment field of the hangar, the vacuum of space encases the ship in a blanket of silence. The only sound that can be heard is the muffled whine of the larty's engines. Colorful lights flood through the transparisteel viewports as lasers fly all around. The planet of Kamino is completely surrounded by the conflict. There are at least 30 Sep vessels and close to the same number of Republic ships. Many of the capitol class battleships are engaged in separate conflicts as each side attempts to overpower the other. Multiple Separatist ships can be seen launching droid landing craft while fighter screens positioned between the Seps and Kamino's surface attempt to shoot them down. Several Delta-7 *Aethersprite*-class light interceptor, can also be seen flying spectacularly among the fighter screens while helping to destroy the landers.
Well behind the Separatists initial ship line, a Droid Control Ship, registering as the *Insurrection*, can be seen launching its starfighters and landers. The ship is surrounded by 4 *Munificent*-class star frigate that are acting as the guardians of the Sep's flagship.
The V-19 squadron leader says to Oddball over the comm "Ok, we are going in hard. Blue squadron will do a strafing run with their torpedoes against the frigate second to the left. You will follow us, Green Squadron, through after their run. It is our job to keep the flying clankers off your tail. You just make sure you can keep up!"

Now that the battle was fully underway, Kuur engrossed himself in the sensor readings of the larty. He knew that Oddball would need some extra help getting through the muck that they were about to hit, and he was determined to give it to him. The best defense, he reasoned, was a good offense. Punching through the various holos, Kuur began to route the most recent sensor data straight into Twitch's HUD so that the pilot could plot the best course through the battle fields. He also raised the shields, just in case.
Switching over to the unit frequency, Kuur spoke to Sigma.
"Sarge, how about you take a look at this data, here? With the way our fighters are screening, how do you figure Twitch should plan his firing solution so he doesn't hit our boys?" (In other words, make the Knowledge (tactics) check and give Twitch the +2 bonus, please.)

The battle rages on around the LAAT/i. Several capital ships on both sides, their main thruster damaged, can be seen drifting lazily through space as they succumb to a decaying orbit around Kamino. Most have severe hull breaches that are leaking frozen air and sometimes troopers and equipment. The fighter screens have been only partially successful in preventing the landing of the droid armies. Over the GAR frequencies on engineering terminal on the LAAT/i, ground reports are confirming the loss of several key landing platforms in Tipoca City and Baran Wu.
The *Insurrection* and its guardian flotilla have come under attack by three Acclamators from Battle Group Beta. The droid starfighters (all 1,500 of them) have enveloped the Separatist flagship and strike out at any GAR fighters that come close enough. The Acclamators are slowly overpowering the frigates with their superior firepower but completely disabling quickly them is nigh impossible with the *Insurrection* using its forward batteries to back them up.
As the LAAT/i follows Green Squadron towards the flotilla, Blue leader says over the comm, "Alright, you all sit tight while we annoy these Seps for a second. We hope to disable their port side batteries with two passes. Stay clear until I give you the go ahead."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Getting Kuur's sensor readings and Sigma's advice, Twitch begins to get all excited. "Ho boy! This is gonna be fun!" he says as he begins to flip switches and press buttons on his control panel.
In the passenger bay of the LAAT/i, the whine of power generators charging and the clanking of the mass-drivers loading can be heard.
Twitch then says over the inter-squad frequency, "Thanks for the info guys and don't worry I won't hit our vode!"

Glad that the discussion on mixing the squads is over, at least for now, Res relaxes. Then he remembers he's in stuck in the passenger seat in the middle of a space battle. It's not that he doesn't like flying, he just hates the feeling of helplessness, of not having anything to contribute to his own or his brothers' safety. So, like many clones, he cranks up some music to both distract himself and psych himself up in the privacy of his own helmet. The rhythmic beat of the tree-drum music is only occasionally broken by comm traffic directed towards the laarty, after all he doesn't want to be *entirely* out of the loop.

As the three Acclamators continue to pound the frigates with their powerful turbolasers, they release their V-19s to engage the numerous droid starfighters. Multiple dogfights ensue and many ships wink out of existence in brilliant explosions. Two of the frigates are moderately damaged while the other two are relatively unharmed (but have weakened deflector shields).
Blue and Green Squadron streak away from the LAAT/i as they head towards the unharmed frigate that blocks the way to the *Insurrection*. The frigate's point defense batteries open fire and several V-19s are obliterated before they even reach their mark. Suddenly several dozen blue streaks depart the squadrons as they release half of their payload of proton torpedoes. The first couple detonate on the already weakened deflector shield and cause it to fail. The remaining torpedoes find their mark as each of their baradium cores detonate in brilliant flashes of light. The intense light from the explosions is enough for the commando's helmets to auto-dim their HUDs as it floods through the LAAT/i's viewports. Once the light subsides, the frigate can be seen floating on its side. The torpedoes have ripped open the frigate's entire port side and frozen atmosphere and flames are spewing out from numerous hull fractures. The squadrons make another pass to ensure the frigate's demise, this time only releasing one torpedo from each fighter. Suddenly the ship splits in half as the reactor core overloads from the numerous torpedo detonations as the squadrons come back around towards the LAAT/i.
Green Leaders says, "Alright Oddball, time to get those commandos where they are needed."

As Oddball follows Green leader through floating debris that was once a *Munificent*-class star frigate, his scanning of the *Insurrection* reveals a small blind spot in its point defense batteries. Oddball believes that the rectenna array behind the Core ship is a perfect place to drop the commandos off.
As the GAR ships streak out through the frigate's wreckage, tiny flashes can be seen all over the *Insurrection*.
Green Leader cries out, "Incoming flak! Watch yourselves!"
And as if on cue, shells explode all around the V-19s and the LAAT/i. Oddball's expert piloting skills allows him to weave the gunship around the explosions with extreme grace but some shrapnel can be heard bouncing off the particle shields. Some of the other clone pilots are not so lucky. Several V-19s are ripped apart by the flak and only one of the pilots is able to eject before his ship detonates from an overloaded thruster. Then suddenly the flak explosion cease as hundreds of Vulture-class droid starfighters rise off of the Insurrection's hull and take flight towards the incoming clones.
Green Leader says, "Form up around the gunship! We will spearhead our way through!"
The remaining V-19s form up around the gunship as the droid starfighters reach firing distance. The V-19s release the last of their proton torpedoes against the first wave. The resulting explosion blows a huge hole in the defensive line of the droids.
Meanwhile, Twitch has been using the intel that Sigma and Kuur have been giving him. Once the gunship and V-19s break through the initial line of the droid starfighters, Twitch lets loose with all the weapons he can. The larty's passenger bay is filled with the constant whine of the composite beams generators and the clanking of the mass driver gears. As Twitch's hands fly over the console, the composite beams sweep out at a group of droid starfighters and split several of them in two. He also fires several salvos of missiles that pass the clone pilots and punch holes straight through the rest of the intial droid wave. "YEAAHHH! That is how it's done!" screams Twitch as he watches the destruction he has caused.

As Oddball pilots the gunship through the remains of the Vultures, the V-19s fan out to intercept any other droids that will attempt to intercept them on their approach.
*In the passenger bay, a red light near the door turns on thus signaling that the commandos have one minute till insertion. Any final preparations should be taken now.*
As the gunships closes in, the point-defense batteries of the droid control ship open fire. Oddball's expert piloting makes the gunship a difficult target but several high powered bolts connect with the ship and are absorbed by its beefed up deflector shields.
The gunship is now in close proximity to the *Insurrection* and skims just several meters above is surface in hopes of avoiding the ship's sensors.
*As Oddball pilots the ship toward the rectenna array, Kuur is able to check out the schematics to the Lucrehulk-class control ship and and verify the extremely small blind spot. From there the gunship is out of the firing arc of the surrounding laser batteries. As long as Oddball can keep the gunship in that tiny blind spot, they only need to worry about being spotted by any Droid starfighters that may fly by.
Kuur can also see a great spot to plant the charges (if he stills want to blow his way in). The individual rectenna of the array have exceptional armor and thus need a sturdy structure. However, since they are vital to the the ship's communications there is a network of maintenance passageways for engineers. The hub of the passageways is near the dead center of the array. The armor is just as thick there but there is substantially less bulkhead to blow through.*

If you park there, you'll probably be ok with the only concern being flying clankers. Sarge. If we can drop ourselves **here**, in the middle of the antenna array, We can probably blow our way into their service ducts with minimal problems, saving our charges for inside the ship, instead of outside. Just in case you're taking suggestions, that is. These two look like they'd work."

Kuur unplugs himself from his seat and pats his hands around his armor. More of a nervous habit than a necessity, since Kuur is **very** careful with his kit. Jumping out from the Larty onto the hull of the ship, Kuur feels his magnetic boots kick in and anchor him to the hull. Moving purposefully towards the spot on the hull above the crawlspaces, Kuur takes out one explosive charge, setting it directly above where the service shaft should be. He works quietly and meticulously. Kuur's always felt that some people talk too much when they should be focused on their work. He focuses. That's why he's one of the best in the GAR at blowing stuff up and **not** blowing himself up. Plugging in the timer and taking the remote, Kuur then moves to rejoin his brothers.
Looking at Sigma, Kuur holds up the detonator and speaks over the unit frequency. He speaks in Basic for Kyata's sake.

As the Larty slips past the last of the point defense batteries, it takes a few glancing hits but nothing big enough to puncture its sturdy shields. As Oddball keeps the Larty hovering on its repulsors just a few meters above the *Insurrection's* hull, the red light turns green and the Larty's doors open. Then the air is sucked out into the vacuum of space as the Larty's atmospheric containment field shuts off.
Kuur is the first one out the door and is already planting the charges.

"Looks like we're here Miss," replies Fifty as the doors slide open and Kuur gets to work. His suit was insulated and vacuum sealed but still, he didn't like being exposed to space like this. The sooner they were inside the better. Helping kuur back into the transport he responds to his comment, "I think that should be our commander's call Sir."

Res turns off the music and does a last minute check of his equipment, of course everything's already in order but you can never be too sure. He readies his rifle and prepares to be one of the first out the door.
On Sigma's command he shouts "Oya vode!" and hops out of the laarty. Magnetic boots clamping to the hull, Res trudges as quickly as possible to the target.

Al'verde checks his rifle's power pack and then jumps out after Res to secure the area.
"Alright men lets help Adenn secure the point. Twitch keep us covered from there then join us once we have breached", says Fifty as he checks his equipment.
Blitz and Shiv both acknowledge the order and jump onto the *Insurrection's* hull. Fifty jumps out after them and they all spread out looking for any signs that they may have been spotted by the Seps.
"Elek ruus'alor!" shouts Twitch as he runs some stealthy sensor sweeps to look for passing Vultures.
Kyata also jumps out of the gunship and joins the commandos in securing the area. She searches the Force and has a bad feeling about the coming extraction.
As the commandos and Kyata spread out to cover the area, Kuur's computer picks up a fairly weak but encoded tracking signal from the gunship.
Suddenly, Twitch shouts over the comm, "Osik! Oddball, someone's got us locked!! I'm launching chaff!"
Then two pods release from the sides of the gunship and explode into clouds of tiny metal fragments.
Suddenly, four torpedoes come streaking from around one of the rectenna and are heading straight for the gunship.

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-31 21:16:18)

Kuur noded to Sigma without even looking up at the oncoming torpedos. After all, it wasn't his job to look after the larty, it was his job to blow a hole in the side of the ship and get his squad inside ASAP. Oddball would look after the larty, or get himself out of it if need be. Kuur focused, and that was what made him among the best.
Raising his gauntleted arm, Kuur hovered his finger over the button for the split second it took him to say, "**Fire in the hole!**" He then presses the button, unleashing his carefully planted explosive charge on the ship's access hatch to blow it open.
(As previously stated, Mechanics check +20+1d6 [Force Point] to set the charges. If I can, I'll take 10.)
(14d6 damage, hoping for some really nasty damage based on the mechanics check.)
(8/9 FP)

## Re: Chapter 1: The Defense of Kamino

### **Mandalore89** (2009-08-01 20:01:57)

The explosive charge detonates and its power can be felt throughout the hull the commandos are standing on. The blast punctures straight through the layered durasteel straight into the maintenance hub. Frozen atmosphere, debris and even a few battle droids are expelled through the big hole that Kuur created. There is now an open path straight down into the maintenance hub, which should provide easy access to the rest of the ship.
(Kuur's Mechanics check = 19+6+20 = 45 so the damage was 14d6 X3 = 135)
After Kuur has detonated the charge, he still notices that his computer is picking up the weak tracking frequency coming from the LAAT/i.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oddballs piloting skills allow him to put the gunship into a tight corkscrew and then a backwards loop (maneuvers the ship obviously wasn't designed for) as he attempts to avoid the incoming torpedoes. The first two of the torpedoes tracking sensors are tricked by the clouds of chaff and they detonate prematurely. However, their explosions disperse the tiny metals fragments enough to allow the two remaining torpedoes to keep their initial lock-on. One of the torpedoes barely misses the gunship's port wing but still triggers its detonation. The resulting explosion rips the wing from the gunship and propels the damaged Larty into the path of the last incoming torpedo. The explosion tears right through the aft of the ship separating its passenger bay from its nose. The nose is sent spinning off into space while debris from the gunship's aft rains down among the commandos on the hull.
Meanwhile, Twitch's hands are flying over his consoles to assess the damages until he sees the what is left of the port side wing streak past the cockpit's transparisteel window. He then realizes that their current trajectory will put them into the path of the surrounding turbolasers in under 30 seconds.
"Ner vod, I'm punching us out!" Twitch shouts to Oddball as he pulls the red handle under his seat. The cockpit capsule then rockets away from the remains of the gunship.
Twitch looks up and out the transparisteel and notices that *Insurrection's* hull is coming up on them fast.
"...osik."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Those on the hull witness the cockpit capsule streak away from the remains of the gunship only to rocket straight into the *Insurrection's* hull about 300 meters from any of the commandos.
Those in Orar squad notice that Twitch's HUD feed has been replaced with static before it finally registers a signal loss.

"Move! Move! Move!" Kyata calls out, leaving the relative safety where they stood, and making for the impromptu doorway Kurr just made in the large ship. Drawing one lightsaber along the way, and keeping it in hand. "We got a mission people. Lets be about it."
The Jedi was also concerned about the fate of the Clones aboard the Larty, but there was little she could do for them now. She logged in her comlink the time and place she last saw the capsule, hoping it would help retrieve them at some point.

Kuur looks on in awe as the larty bobs and weaves its way through various turns and dips to avoid the oncoming missiles.
*This makes no sense. How in the galaxy did they find us here to target? I specifically chose this spot for its sensor blind spot.*
A blinking light in his HUD caused Kuur to look down at his computer gauntlet.
*A tracking signal? On our larty? What?*
Kuur looked back up in horror as he realized just **how** the missiles had found Oddball. Speaking over the comm frequency:
"Oddball! Twitch! Get out of there vode! **Now!** You've got a ..."
Kuur never got to finish his statement as the last missile struck the larty just as the cockpit ejected, rocketing into the ...
... the hull of the ship.
Kuur quietly un-shouldered his DLT-20A and followed Kyata into the ship, keeping his eyes and ears open for any sign of possible threats, but not before he made sure that he had a recording of his findings on the signal. He'd be sure to study them when the moment presented itself, and then he'd make sure that however it happened, it wouldn't happen again.

As Kuur takes a look around before following Kyata, he notices motion in the cockpit capsule, which is now lodged backwards into a crater in the hull. It is possible that maybe someone is still alive.
Kuur, as well as the rest of the commandos, also notice several access hatches opening up between him and the crashed cockpit. Out of the two of the bigger hatches appear four A-DSD dwarf spider droids (these models look to be a major improvement over the ones the commandos encountered on Geonsosis). Also, three complete squads (24 droids) of B2 series Super Battle Droids appear out of the the remaining hatches. Two squads rush to form a line in front of the Spiders while the while the other seems to making its way towards the cockpit capsule.
It seems almost impossible that these droids have been mobilized so quickly.

Kuur -31
Fifty -30
Shiv -28
Res -26
Blitz -25

### **Anonymous** (2009-08-02 14:20:54)

Just as Kuur was about to jump inside and follow Kyata, he noticed the movement inside the capsule. Without even looking, he piped over the unit frequency.
"Sarge! Someone's moving in that capsule! Oddball! Twitch! Su'cuy gar?"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Su'cuy gar = still alive

</details>

As Kuur finished speaking his words, his breath caught in his throat as hatch after hatch popped open, spilling droids onto the hull of the ship.
"**Dar'yaim!** Sarge, we've got clankers! There's no way they could have responded that fast, sir. Also, a few seconds ago, I picked up a light tracking signal coming from the larty. Sir, I think we've got a mole somewhere. **When** we get back, sir, I'll do an intensive look through the computer logs to find out who it is, sir."
Looking at the droids standing between the squads and the capsule, Kuur's mind went into overdrive as he lined up his first shot at the closest of the droids.
*Do the droids see us yet?* (Knowledge [tactics] +15)
*How far away are the droid control towers? (How long will it take Orar Squard to get to them?)* (Knowledge [technology] +15 for the ship's schematics)
*Which would be better, run through the ship to take out the control towers, or try and cut our way through the droids in front of us?* Knowledge [tactics] +15)
*With Twitch currently inside the capsule with Oddball, Orar's demolitionist is down. Will Orar need Kuur to blow the towers if they go that way?* (Knowledge [tactics] +15)
(As soon as Kuur answers the above questions, he'll relay that information to the squad so Kyata, Sigma, and Fifty can make their decisions.)
(If the droids do see them, then Kuur will open fire on the closest droid. **BlasTech DLT-20A +11 (3d10+4)**)

## Re: Chapter 1: The Defense of Kamino

### **Mandalore89** (2009-08-02 14:55:33)

*((The droids definitely see you. The Supers are finishing up their defensive line in front of the Spiders and are preparing to attack.
There are control towers all around the commandos, too many to take down with the charges provided. This was the reason that Orar needed to infiltrate the ship the whole way down to the ship's droid brain banks. It should take around 10 minutes to get down there if they don't run into too much trouble.
The best way to get to those banks would be through the hole Kuur just made, but the only way to save any possible survivors from the capsule would be to battle through the droids.
Kuur also knows that Blitz has the capacity to blow the droid brains if needed (he may not be as skilled as either Kuur or Twitch but he knows how to set them and it shouldn't take much to destroy those banks once they bypass the blast doors) ))*
Kuur's impressive shot blows the closest Super Battle Droid in half just as it raises it's arm to fire and the two pieces of its body drift off into space.
*(Attack= 11+11=22 Dmg=21)*
Kuur doesn't get any response from Twitch and if he switches over to the inter-squad frequency, Twitch's HUD feed doesn't register. Kurr can not be too sure about Oddball yet.

"Move towards your objective Adenn Squad, the mission is your priority *brothers*," commanded Fifty through the unit wide comm-channel, he then changed to Orar squad's private channel, and changed his tone dramatically. "Twitch.. Twitch, can you here me?!" The commando's brow furrowed beneath his helmet as his face contorted in rage. "Orar, we're going to get our brother and then move towards our target, understood?" With this command Fifty raises his wrist and charges forward before firing an ion blaster rocket at the nearest battledroid between him and the downed cockpit.

The miniature rocket streaks away from Fifty's arm and strikes a Super Battle Droid. The resulting detonation releases a surge of ions that seem to short out some of the droid's major circuitry including it's magnetic feet. The force of the impact is enough to propel the droid off of the *Insurrection's* hull and into space.

As Oddball looks around at the surrounding cockpit, all he sees is chaos. Most of the transparisteel has been broken out (and with them gone the atmosphere is gone as well) and the durasteel supports are bent every which way. Many of the consoles in front of him are all offline and most are shooting out sparks as electrical surges pass through them. When he turns around to check on Twitch, he realizes why the gunner has not spoken up. The impact forced a durasteel support from behind Twitch's seat straight through his helmet. The exit wound and the back of Oddball's seat are covered with the frozen expulsion of Twitch due to his armor's depressurization.
As Oddball looks outside, he can see the Spiders and Supers forming a line between him and his brothers and he sees the one squad of Supers marching towards the downed capsule.
As Oddball assesses his injuries, he notices that breathing seems a little hard. The adrenaline coursing through his veins prevents him from feeling most of the pain, but he figures that he has cracked a few ribs and possibly fractured his foot.
((He has taken 27 pts of dmg from the collision, though in terms of gameplay the broken foot doesn't affect his movement. Its just for story ;D ))
*Those that have attempted to contact the cockpit can hear Oddball's statement and know he is alive.*
((This takes place before the initiative really began so Oddball will get a full set of actions when it comes to his turn.))

Shiv's charge towards the line of Supers almost gets him there. Some of the Supers look at each other and seem to wonder why a clone would have a vibroblade. They just shrug it off and prepare to shoot the oncoming clone.

With a sinking feeling growing in the pit of his stomach Res watches in silence while the missiles streak towards the laarty. When the missiles hit he winces, though the expression is lost behind his helmet and when it becomes evident the ejection capsule is headed straight for the deck the knot in his stomach turns into a lump in his throat. As the capsule careens into the ship Res swallows the lump and utters a single word, "Shab". Noticing that Twitch's feed shows only static he knows all to well what Orar is going through right now, though perhaps it's even worse the second time around.
Oddball's message gives Res renewed hope though and before he even realizes what he's doing his legs start moving towards the capsule...and the intervening droids. Despite the priority of their mission he has no intention of leaving a brother behind, besides somebody has to fly them back off this boat and it might as well be Oddball.
Over the inter-squad frequency he shouts, "They didn't give us these grenades just to look at *vode*, let's pop some clankers!". Res aims at the Super Battle Droid line and fires off a grenade.
((Move: towards the capsule, though I don't want to be within "splash-zone" distance of Shiv

Res's grenade streaks towards a couple of Supers. The droids attempt to separate but the resulting EMP pulse washes over both of them. Their motions become sporadic and eventually cease as their systems shut down. With nothing to keep their feet magnetized to the hull, they begin to drift lazily into space.

Blitz is shocked by what has happened to his brother. *No, I can't lose any more!* He follows Fifty's lead and charges towards the line of Supers, firing off a couple of slugs with his modified slugthrower rifle. The shots punch through one of the Supers heads and knock it into space.
((22 dmg))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The A-DSD Spider Droids are now in position behind the line of SBDs and begin acting as mobile artillery support in attempts to obliterate their enemies from afar.
They target the closest commandos (Fifty, Shiv, Res and Blitz) and fire off a salvo from their blaster cannons.
A ricochet bounces off of the hull in front of Fifty and streaks up to glance off his right arm, leaving a nasty scorch mark.
((It missed you by a decent amount but you take half dmg= 5 after your DR))
Shiv is almost knocked forward as a bolt explodes behind him at his feet. He can feel the heat through his reinforced plastoid but the armor holds and prevents most of the damage.
((The spider just barely missed :P so you take only take 5 dmg after your DR)
A massive energy bolt flies by Res way off to his right. It seems that this Spider has not had its targeting system calibrated recently.
((This one just barely missed you so your evasion saved you :P ))
The last of the cannon bolts connects with Blitz's chestplate and almost knocks him off his feet. His armor is glows hot for a little before cooling off. Blitz seems to ignore the immense pain and continues his assault.

Al'verde watches in awe as the capsule rockets into the hull on the far side of the array. Adrenaline course through his body as the droids assemble themselves between him and his brothers.
"Hang on ner vod, we'll get you out of there," says the commando as he lines up a long distance shot against one of the Spiders. The shadowskin coating on his armor renders him almost invisible to the droids so the high powered bolt fired from his rifle takes his target by surprise.
The powerful bolt blows right through one of the Spider's photoreceptor's and out the back of its head. The bolt probably took out one of its main processing banks for locomotion as it now has a difficult time keeping itself upright.

It looks to be calculating shot a retaliatory shot but Sigma is already through the hole in the hull.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Blitz's continues his charge towards the Supers while firing off several more slugs. Once again, his slugs easily punch through the armor off a Super and disable it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The three remaining Spiders target the incoming commandos. Two of them fire a salvo from their cannons, while the third launches two missiles from the mass-drives on its back side.
The two bolts explode near each of their respective targets, Fifty and Blitz. ((Fifty takes 7 and Blitz takes 8, both after DR))
Meanwhile, the two missiles streak away from the third Spider and home in on Shiv. They detonate just meters above the commando's head. The resulting shock wave buckles the hull plating underneath his feet and the other SBD next to him is obliterated. Shiv is lucky that his armor is better than that of the droid's
((Shiv takes 10 points after DR))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Al'verde doesn't like that he has to leave his brothers but he will not disobey a direct order.
He fires off a shot at the Spider already damaged by Res before jumping into the hole.
The bolt blows a hole straight through the Spider's head and knocks it out of commission.

Realizing his pistol was having little effect, Oddball went for the nearest weapon he could find: Twitch's blaster cannon. Keeping an eye on the droids closing in, he goes to retrieve the weapon. He whispers a quiet thank you to the fallen soldier before hefting the great weapon and pointing right at the enemy.

The remaining Super Battle Droids in what is left of the defensive line continue to rain blaster fire down upon the commandos. However, they have a hard time targeting the commandos that have entered the breach in the line and all of their shots miss.
((I had such terrible rolls once you factor in all the cover and combat <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> ))
However, the Supers near the cockpit raise their arms in unison and open fire. While Oddball is reaching for the cannon, he can feel the impact of the bolts resonate throughout the capsule. Also, the wall seems to be glowing red from their concentrated fire.
((They all miss Oddball because he has improved cover but they are attempting to destroy the cover he has))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As Oddball brings the cannon to bear on the attacking Supers, the droids that he was targeting attempt to scatter. The two Supers only make it a few feet before a massive bolt of energy explodes at their feet. The blast disintegrates them both.
((Dmg=25))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As Sigma looks around the breach that Kuur created, he can see that he is in a narrow durasteel corridor. It goes off in either direction for what seems forever and it has many paths that seem to branch off of it.
*If he looks at the schematics, it shouldn't be too hard to find the nearest sealed access panel to the next level down*

As Kuur dives in after Sigma and Kyata, he looks around at the corridor and the options available to them. Thinking about the schematics he's seen before, Kuur tries to figure out the best way to get to the bridge.

### **Mandalore89** (2009-08-13 23:14:44)

As Kyata and Sigma stand in the hole next to him, Kuur is able to determine their location on the schematics. The only route to reach the bridge from their current location is through the main decks that connect the Core Ship to the outer ring. The access tunnel the commandos are currently in is only a couple over from the central hub. From there, they should be able to descend straight down to the deck below.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The droid attempts to sidestep Shiv's vicious swing but with its feet magnetically locked to the hull it can't retreat fast enough. The vibroblade easily cleaves the droid in two, sending a shower of sparks in all directions.

Res lines up one last shot on a spider droid and fires before jumping down into the hole. Landing beside his brothers he nods to them and General Mentak, as if to say '*Let's go*'.

Res's bolt hits one of the two remaining Spiders. The force of the blast knocks the droid back a couple of feet. It attempts to regain its footing but has difficulty due to damaged servos.

((Fifty's charge allows him to completely bypass both the first line of SBDs and the Spiders. He is now only 2 move actions behind the SBDs attacking the cockpit.
And Korihor, you can definitely slice your way through those doors. It'll take time but since they have airlocks you can avoid depressurizing the underlying deck))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Blitz fires off two more slugs as he continues his charge towards the remaining SBDs. The slugs hit home and obliterate one of the droids.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The injured Spider fires a bolt at the rampaging commando with the vibroblade. Shiv is able to dodge to bolt itself but is still caught in the detonation when the bolt connects with the hull behind him.
((8 Dmg with DR accounted for))
The other Spider is paying attention to the commando that sprinted past it towards the downed cockpit. The Spider charges Fifty and stabs him with one of its claws. The force of the blow puts a nice dent in Fifty's armor and almost knocks him off his feet.
((13 Dmg with DR accounted for))

Once Al'verde makes it into the hole, he looks to Sigma and Kuur and says, "So, where to next?"

"Follow me," Kuur says aloud for the General's benefit. She should really consider an earpiece when leading clones, perhaps he'll make her one after the mission.
Kuur leads the way through the winding passages until they reach an airlock and begins slicing it open.
((Mechanics +20))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Res visually examines the others and is glad to see they haven't been hit. He quickly checks over his injuries, determines them to be superficial, and follows behind Kuur. When they reach the door Res gets into position and gets ready for trouble when Kuur gets the door open.
((Hold action to shoot any hostiles on the other side, BlasTech DLT-20A +13 (4d10+4). Is there room to "stack" the door, i.e. line up on the side so we have cover when it opens, or does the door fill the entire hallway? If there is room, Res wants to be first in line.))

## Re: Chapter 1: The Defense of Kamino

### **Mandalore89** (2009-08-24 18:27:06)

As the airlock begins to open, Kuur's computer informs him that the ship is attempting to lock him out of the airlock's terminal. The airlock's first set of doors only open about a foot before they quickly stall. The door's servos are strained as they receive instructions from two different sources. But Kuur is able to override the ship's input with some quick slicing and the first set of doors finish sliding open.
The airlock beyond these doors is an 4 meter by 4 meter room with an identical set of doors on the opposite wall.
((There is about 3 feet of wall on each side of the door, so there is definitely enough room to stack up.))
