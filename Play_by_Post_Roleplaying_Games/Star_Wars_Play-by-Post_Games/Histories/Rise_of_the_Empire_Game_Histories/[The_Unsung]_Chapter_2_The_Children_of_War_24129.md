# [The Unsung] Chapter 2: The Children of War

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-22 15:30:15)

As most of the group makes its way into the Chancellor's office, they are all greeted by Kari, who offers them a drink. The Chancellor, who is standing next to the inactive holo-projector, smiles at each person as they enter the room and offers them each to take a seat. Looking around the room at those gathered (Haden, Lyle, Koyi, Jace, and Anazider), he looks at the chrono display on a nearby wall panel.

The droid shook its head back and forth for a second.

It might be a few minutes before the meeting starts.

Between the various sounds of traffic filling Coleâ€™s ears he had not realized that his comlink was beeping. It was not until the traffic had died down some that he heard the sound coming from his comlink. â€œWell, so much for finding a place to rest,â€ he said with a sign before opening his comlink. â€œThis is Cole.â€ Noticing a cluster of transports coming in his direction he began to move away from the traffic so that he could hear clearly.

Cole plugged a gloved finger in his left ear so he could hear Kariâ€™s message. He nodded in understanding as he replied. â€œIâ€™ll be there as soon as I can.â€ Closing the comlink, he scanned for another taxi.
**I really need some more medpacs. Perhaps, I can make a stop for some supplies on the way.**

Jace takes a drink and sets down to enjoy it. "Sor was in the middle of game I told him you called he should be along shortly." Jace goes back to his brooding about how best to get Nana out of that place. "We visited my old stomping ground. Visited an old friend of mine." He sets back and sips his drink. *"I have to find away to get her out of there."* Jace's mood is out there for all to see, he is really quite for Jace.

Sor is still grumbling about rude interruptions as he walks in the door. He looks straight at the chancellor as he asks, as politely as he can manage, "What'd you call me for?" Those who saw him might assume he had lost credits during his game, but in truth he actually came out ahead. He's just annoyed at having to leave before he could learn more about the Maw Group.

The Chancellor turned and smiled at Sor and Cole as they came in.
> **Fyor wrote:**

The Chancellor turned towards the holo-projector behind him and pressed a button. The holo-projector activated and colors swarmed in the air until they coalesced in the shape of a star system. None of the party recognize the system at all. As the Chancellor continues talking, the images change to show different views of the system, and even zoom in on particular spots.
> **Fyor wrote:**
>
> This is the Abran system, on the edge of known space and Wild Space. It is home to the B&#39;Knos colony. The colony was founded a few centuries ago mostly so that the nearby asteroid belt, shown here, could be mined for minerals. And, it worked, well enough, for a while. However, word recently reached nearby planets that a miner&#39;s strike had begun in the system, with the miners refusing to work and the members of the royal government not knowing how to handle it. So, after speaking with Lord Joka Nayus and hearing his side of the story, I agreed to ask Master Ralraccor and the Jedi council to lend us a Jedi Negotiator to resolve the matter before neighboring systems were brought in, or corporate interests became an issue. I&#39;m sure that each of you understands that if the corporations tried to settle this, there would be massive bloodshed.
> Well, Master Ralraccor agreed and sent Master Ree and her padawans to the Abran system to negotiate the peaceful settlement of the strike. Reports came in regularly, reporting little progress. Then, about a week ago, the reports stopped entirely. Both Master Ralraccor and I would like to know what happened to Master Ree and her padawans. I can&#39;t authorize a Republic Military group to enter the area, since the system is outside the Republic&#39;s jurisdiction. So, I am asking you to go in and assess the situation. Find out what you can about Master Ree. Master Ralraccor has also assigned Master Anazider to this group in the hope that he will allow you to use diplomacy instead of force. It would be great if this could be settled without any blood shed.
> Now, as to your transportation, I have arranged transport on a private vessel for you to the Abran system. The pilot and her ship are waiting for you right now at the Blue Sector Spaceport. Are there any questions?

The Chancellor looks around to see if there are any.

"I have one." Sor had calmed down as he listened to the briefing, happy to be able to get back to business so soon. He steps forward from the wall he had been leaning on and uncrosses his arms as he asks, "Any word on how well Danny's holonet scheme worked? I'm curious as to whether they believed him or not." Sor is, of course, referring to Danyeal Young's attempt to throw the Maw Group into disarray by telling them their leader betrayed them. He had hoped to get this information by getting the Ryn at the cantina drunk, but since that had fallen through, he thought he'd try asking the Chancellor.

"I was hoping for a little more useful, accurate information than the holonet news can provide. Still, I suppose that 'a higher trust of the Jedi Order and in Chancellor Fyor in particular' will have to do." With a shrug, Sor returns to leaning against the wall, arms re-crossed. It was obvious he had no further questions.

Anazider paced around the holoprojector with his hands folded behind his back, analyzing the image of the Abran system.
**"Is it known why the miner's were striking? And do we have access to the reports?"**
The nobleman peers through the holographic projection directly at the Chancellor, a silvered-eyebrow quirked in askance. He continues pacing about the projector until he comes to a point where he can gauge the reaction of both the Chancellor and the hastily assembled members of his team.

Jace listens to the breifing. They where going to strike a blow for justice and the Republic way of life, good he need the credits anyway. "So what is our cover? or are we supposed to figure that part out on ourselves?" Jace liked to now how he was going to bluff his way in, so that way he could aviod having blaster pointed at him when they landed. "Other then our cover story we are on our own I assume? Cause I don't see the you being able to save our skins when are planet side."

However, until they surface again, if they do, we won&#39;t know anything solid about them. Unless one of you finds something out someday.
> Master Anazider, we only know what Master Ree reported on. So far we know that the miners became disenfranchised, claiming that their worker rights were being violated. However, Master Ree&#39;s preliminary assessment denies this claim. We also know that both the miners and the royal families have both hired mercenaries to protect their various interests and that these groups have made raids on both sides of the conflict. We do not know if there have been casualties yet. And, yes, you may most certainly have access to the reports. Speak with Kari before you go, and she will have compiled the reports at that time for you.
> Master Pavon, the ship I have arranged for you is a transport ship of some sort, I&#39;m not very good with those kind of details. I would suggest that you all pose as shippers, or smugglers, bringing supplies into the system. I might suggest that you attempt to make contact with the royal families first, as that is where Master Ree&#39;s last known location. And, yes, once you leave, you will be outside the Republic&#39;s jurisdiction and thus outside of any help I could send you. Master Ree was told the same thing, but you have all presented another opportunity to resolve this peacefully.

The Chancellor looked around again, double checking for any last minute questions.

Cole leaning back against the wall near the door, raises his gaze to the Chancellor. " I have one. Well.... Its really more a request. If we are going to be so far out then we are going to need some medical supplies and not just med packs. I only have two and I am sure that if we get into a tight spot we will need alot more than that. Perhaps, even some more power packs for the few pistol wielding folk?"

"You mentioned a Lord Joka Nayus. What is his connection to B'Knos? Are there any other names we should know? Are there any corporations that are specifically interested in B'Knos? And what sort of security is in place on the colony?" Koyi replied without hesitation. She was a security officer, and theres were the sort of questions she was trained to ask.

While the other families have a say in how matters are run, Lord Nayus&#39;s decisions tend to trump the others. At least, that&#39;s how the reports make it out to be. As to corporate interests, I&#39;d say that SoroSuub is probably the most interested in the mining facilities. However, I&#39;m sure that smaller businesses also have their dealings with the colonies.
> Master Zeyn, glad to see you&#39;ve made it. However, I&#39;m afraid that your comrades will have to brief you mid-flight. I would suggest that this group head out immediately to the space port. There, you will find your pilot for this journey, a Kyta Limei, waiting for you in docking bay seventy-six. I wish each of you the best of luck. May the Force be with you.

With that, the Chancellor heads out of the spacious antechamber and into his private office.
Kari walks over and hands Koyi the reports she asked for. She also has two power packs, two energy cells, and two medpacs for anyone who wants them.

Anazider bows respectfully to the Chancellor, then turns to the others, his hands still folded neatly behind his back. He assumes a perfectly diplomatic posture as he speaks.
**"Some of you I've met, for the rest this is our introduction. As mentioned, I am Anazider, a consular of the Jedi Temple that will be helping to negotiate the issues plaguing B'Knos with all of you. I look forward to our journey and the continued success of your mission."**

Koyi actually manages a smile, as she takes the binder cuffs, as well as the spare ammunition and medpacs. "Well, if no one else has questions for the Chancellor, then I suggest we be on our way."
She then walked over and stood by the door, waiting to see if the others would join her in going to the hanger or not.

"Shall we then?" offering his arm to escort her to the awaiting ship. Jace thought that other would follow and they could get the mission started. "We will let you know how things go Chancalor. Good day." Jace smiles at Koyi hopeing that she would not think ill of him for is efferts to make her feel welcome.

Watching the Twi'lek depart, he grins and scoops up the datapad reports and begins to peruse them as he walks. Gliding through the chamber, and then out into the hallway, he strides over to a large chest sitting near the doors leading into the Chancellor's office. While continuing to read the reports, Anazider absently taps the chest, and slowly it begins to rise into the air, supported on a repulsor pad. The hovering coffer follows after the Prince as he negotiates the corridors of the Republic building, his face still buried in the reports. When he exits, he makes his way for the starport along with the rest, recovering however much information that he can to best be prepared for the upcoming endeavor.

"Its a pleasure to meet you Master Jedi." He nodded to Kari in reply. "Thank you, I am sure that I can find someone to install the spring load kits for my pistols," he said as he past through doors to make his way to the hanger.

"Well, time to go then I guess." Sor cracks his neck, following the others out. As he does, he checks his gun, making sure it's in full, working order. Noting the number of shots that remained in his current power pack, he returns it to the concealed holster at his side. Then, remembering the Hold-Out pistol he got during the terrorist attack, he pulls it from his pocket, checking it as well. With his survey of his weapons complete, he shifts into a full fast walk towards the starport along with the others.

(Assuming that everyone's going.)
As the group reaches docking bay seventy-six, in the Blue Sector Spaceport, you are greeted at the door by a female Codru-Ji. She smiles at you, quickly flashing her sharpened canines before walking up and extending her upper right hand.

As you board the gang plank into the lowest level, Kyta points out some of the basic foodstuffs that are being shipped into the B'Knos colony. She explains that while each of you may not care, you should know what your transporting as part of your cover. She points out the lift in the rear of the cargo bay, but since there's eight of you, she takes you up the gang plank to the second level. Here, she points out the cockpit, crew quarters, gunnery stations, and engineering bay. As she points out the engineering bay, everyone hears a loud electronic beep followed by a wail.
Dust issues from the engineering bay, along with a few sparks, and a droid comes flying out of the bay before screeching to a hault in front of Kyta.

Koyi looks at Jace when he offers her his arm. She frowns, and doesn't take it as she walks though the door to the ship. She didn't understand why so many men seemed to be interested in her, simply because she was a twi'lek.
Once aboard the *Wyr* Koyi clears her throat. "I just had a medical exam though the CSF, so I'll pass." She then immediately walks towards the quarters, and locks the door. She had little desire for companionship at the moment.

There is no way thatâ€™s happening to this bunch that just beat up the maw group. Lyle simply waves his hand backwards at the Khil and follows Koyi towards the quarters. Knocking on her door he asks *â€œIf you seem nervous or unsure about anything, the other Jedi and myself can work up some old meditation tricks to help you on your journey on becoming a knight with us."* After having said that Lyle just props his body against the bulky walls of the ship and closes his eyes for a moment.

Cole stepped into docking bay seventy-six and fixed his eyes on the Codru-Ji as she smiled. He gave her a firm handshake and a nod in greeting before focusing on their transport. There was something about the ship that reminded him of his fatherâ€™s old ship, the Kandosii. It was an old beat up freighter like the Eekai L4000 in front of him. Kytaâ€™s comments about the ship not looking like much brought him back to when his father, Adin first showed his mother, Mesh'la the Kandosii. Cole was only four when his father inherited the freighter from his grandfather who, like his father, Adin was a mercenary for hire.
â€œI know it does not look like much but sheâ€™s got quiet a bit a life in her.â€ Adin said to his mother as she and old Cole first looked at it.
â€œKandosii Buir! Vaii mar'eyir bic?â€<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

â€œAwsome dad!Where did you find it?â€

</details>

 Cole said in Mandoâ€™a as his eyes lit up when he saw it. Not caring if it was old or not.
â€œIt was your grandfathers and now itâ€™s ours,â€ Adin answered his son with a smile as he knelt down to Coleâ€™s level. His father peered up at Meshâ€™la and noticed the look of concern on her face.
â€œDonâ€™t worry. Once I am finished repairing her sheâ€™ll be fine,â€ he said in hope to ease her fears.
It wasnâ€™t long after the repairs were finished that Adin took Cole on his first trip into outer space. All the stories Cole heard from those in his clan about space travel and the wondrous things seen in outer space were better then anything he could imagine. He looked out into space from a window in awe as they passed a Nebula. Its brilliant colors forever etched into his memory as a desire filled his heart. It was wanderlust that stayed with him ever since.
Cole smiled and nodded to himself as he looked at the Eekai L4000 and spoke without realizing he was speaking to himself, â€œSheâ€™ll be fine, just fine.â€
He then turned to Xamar, â€œIâ€™ll be back for my exam right after I get my supplies,â€ Cole answered as he turned in the direction of the engineering room, right behind Zeyn.
Padding down the corridor, Cole looked over the ship to try and get a feel for his new temporary home. Its nothing new to him, heâ€™d traveled in various transports and it was a habit for him to get a feel for the ship. He finally reached the engineering room and scanned the area for the two kits heâ€™d requested.
Perception: +8 for his Spring Load Kits and to see if everything is intact.
((OOC: Kandosii in Mandoâ€™a has several meanings. â€œAwesome! Indomitable, noble, ruthless. The Shipâ€™s name is The Indomitable in Mando'a.))

Jace is alittle disappointed that Koyi didn't like the fact that he was just trying to be a gentlemen and escot her to the waiting ship. *"Guess it was ment to happen."* As he walks out with the others he turns to Sor. "So how'd you make out in the game?" Jace was hopeing well but he was destracted by Nana.
When they arrive at the ship his heart had sank even more. "Been awhile sence I traveled this rough. Hopefully the food is good." Jace trys to time he had to run out of here and he thinks this might be the same bucket of bolts that smuggled him out the last time.

Xamar looks crestfallen as each of his new crewmates turns down a medical exam. He quietly turns back towards his computers and begins to make journal entries. Kyta says over her shoulder as she heads back towards the second level.
> **Kyta wrote:**

As Koyi walks towards her quarters that she's picked out, she realizes that there's only one cabin on the ship that's completely private, and she obtained it. The other two private cabins already belong to Kyta and Xamar. Two other cabins are semi-private, both sharing a fresher. Other than that, the other two cabins each have four bunks and one fresher.
Both Zeyn and Cole find their kits in the technical bay on the center deck. They're on a table. As Zeyn and Cole enter the room, however, they find Case standing between them and their kits.
> **Case wrote:**

> Beep beep boop whistle!

While neither Zeyn nor Cole can understand Binary, they can be sure that the droid is being derogatory. However, he does nothing to stop them from taking their kits.
As Jace follows Kyta towards the bridge, where she sits down at the captain's chair, she waves one of her hands dismissively at his question.
> **Kyta wrote:**
>
> We actually transport very few passengers, mostly cargo. And, if you&#39;re curious as to the shape of the ship, you should learn quickly that there is often more than meets the eyes with things and beings. Excuse me.

Kyta flips a switch on the console, bringing up the port frequency.
> **Kyta wrote:**
>
> Port control, this is Captain Limei of the *Wyr*, requesting a departure vector. We are ready for lift off. Repeat we are requesting a departure vector.

There is silence for a few seconds before a voice answers back in what can barely pass for Basic.
> This is Port Control, *Wyr*. You have a clear path on vector two-oh-nine. Repeat two-oh-nine. Smooth flying, *Wyr*

> **Kyta wrote:**
>
> Thank you Port Control. Attention all hands, we are preparing for lift off. Make sure everything is buckled down. We will be exiting the atmosphere in a few moments and from there it will be a minute or two before we reach the hyperspace jump point. We will be making a straight line for the Adran system. Our ETA is going to be in four days, or the second day of Kelona by the Galactic Standard Calendar. Everyone just sit back and enjoy the flight.

After a few minutes, anyone next to a window would see the stars of the universe stretch out into lines of light as the ship enters hyperspace. It occurs to Anazider and Jace that the ETA announced is faster than what this model ship should offer. It occurs to Jace that the ship probably has a x1 hyperdrive unit installed, which is an improvement to the ship's standard design.
This ship appears to be something other than it appeared at first glance.

After the ship takes off, Lyle makes his way down towards the dinning hall and stretches out on the sofa in the room. After a quick moment of shut eye, Lyle decides to take a meditative sitting position on the floor infront of the couch.

**"I have come to learn that each starship has its charms, yes?"**
The Prince offers Kyta an invitingly roguish wink, before she goes off to attend to her duties. Spying Koyi storm off in a huff, Anazider simply shrugs to himself and trods off in an opposite direction, toward one of the two bunks sharing a refresher unit. Deactivating the repulsor pad once inside, the massive spacer chest settles to the floor with a heavy thunk and a bit of shifting, but Anazider pays it little mind as he turns about and goes on his own inspection of the Wyr.
Briefly, he went to inspect the cargo, becoming familiar with it to better help with their cover once they reached the B'knos colony. After the young Jedi felt he had learned a sufficient enough, he went to pay a visit to the Khil.
**"I hope I am not intruding, good doctor. Unlike some of my associates, I have traveled on a proper vessel, and know that physical examinations to be due course. If you are still inclined, I submit myself. If nothing else, Master Xamar, you look like the sort that could provide interesting conversation on so long a voyage?"**
Anazider wore his charming, courtier's smile, one meant to disarm and promote the volunteering of information. He strolled further into the medical bay, his hands folded within the billowing sleeves of his ornate Jedi robes.

As Haden boarded his first starship for quite a while, he could not help that rush of exhilaration he had associated with leaving the domain of the Republic and Jedi Order. In the deepest, darkest corners of space, he answered only to the Force and himself.
Quite willing to take up the unanimously rescinded offer for a medical exam, he watched in silence as Anazider went to take the medical officer's ear. Not quite sure he was willing to tolerate the elaborate monotones of the Jedi Prince, he instead made his way to the cockpit - they would be heading into hyperspace soon, and while many found the sight of the dark vortex nauseating, the Jedi, who fancied himself something of a pilot, thought of it as peaking through the tiniest of apertures at another side of the galaxy.
Seeking out the unoccupied co-pilot's seat, Haden made himself comfortable.

As Anazider pokes around in the cargo holds, he notices that the majority of the stuff is marked "Food Stuff". Only in the back of the ship are a few boxes not labeled. As the Jedi Prince makes his way to hold A, or the medical bay, he notices a feeling through the Force. He manages to catch a glimpse of a small object floating across the room into Xamar's hands before the Khil notices the Falleen and looks up from his work.

Xamar picks up a medical instrument from its stand which Anazider recognizes as a simple medical scanner.

Kyta smiled, showing her canines again before turning towards the control panel, all four of her arms moving to start checking reports and setting the alarms.

Zeyn turns his head towards Cole.
"Quite the jumpy one, isnÂ´t he?"
Ignoring the droids beeping, he picks up his pack and looks around for a good place to sit. Settling down, he unstraps his armor and starts to look it over. He wasnÂ´t a mechanic, and his skills usually lay in the other end of the construct/destruct scale, but at least he would have something to do during the journey.
"Are you a handy man Cole? I suppose the droid could help me with this, but I donÂ´t trust him not to take the fusion cutter to the fabric"

Koyi Denta doesn't reply to Lyle's offer of training right away. She makes herself at home in the small room, leaning her two rifles in the corner, and even takes off her armor and stretches out. Taking a moment to do some of the exercises she learned in the CSF to help clear her mind of what was going on. She had choices to make, and she wondered just how much time she'd have before destiny would force the decision.

Cole knitted his brow at the sounds the droid made as he glanced over to Zeyn and nodded in agreement about Case being jumpy. He continued past Case as if he wasn't there and took his packages he needed to upgrade his pistols. Pulling out a chair by the table, Cole seated himself and began looking over the kits to make sure they were still intact. Hearing Zeynâ€™s question, he glanced up at him and shook his head.
â€œNo, I am afraid weâ€™re both in the same boat. I have some skills with fixing things but nothing that goes past the basics. I need to install these Spring Load Kits onto my pistols,â€ he knitted his brow as he looked the kits over, â€œor do they go in the holsters?â€
He sighed at the situation. â€œThere has to be someone on our team that is handy with things you and I are trying to do.â€
He glanced over at Zeyn once more before getting up from his chair. â€œI guess weâ€™ll just have to ask around and see. Come on, lets go see if we can find someone to help us out with this.â€

**"That obvious, hmm?"**
Anazider laughs to himself as the Khil names him as a Prince, but the chuckle is good-natured and after a moment he glides over to the appointed medical bed, laying down.
**"As to joining the Jedi Temple, well let me say that I learned that Jedi Masters are not all gray-haired grandsires living in caves and speaking to the wind. Sometimes they are four-armed young ladies with beautiful smiles that cheat at *dejarik*."**
The falleen youth, for he was still young by the reckoning of his people, couldn't help but think back to that fateful day, a bemused toss of the head splaying his silver hair on the medical bed. Now he was a Jedi, or at least they allowed him to claim himself as one, but each day brought some minor clash or another where the masters of the temple expected him to give ground and surrender to the Force.
Anazider had never been good at surrendering.
**"So what of you doctor Xamar? Captain Kyta praises your incredible skill, and that coupled with your *other* abilities,"** The Prince shared a coy smile with the Khil at this, **"Could have you your choice of assignment. Why, then, the *Wyr*? Did you lose a game of *dejarik* as well?"**

I thought you would have had your fill at the canteena we where at. I will join you in abit to take your hard earned credits and those of anyone foolish enuff to set down at the table." Jace smiles to himself Sor was his kind of man, but he had no compaltion about cleaning him out if could. Think of the Drunken Rancor made him start thinking about Nana and the fact that he had to fix that problem as well. He had thought about comming her but that would be bad considering that they where undercover maybe he would send her a message over the holonet. If he used his own comm number it would seem normal and all.

Anazider folds his hands neatly on top of his chest as the Khil begins his scanning. He sits perfectly still, except for the slight turning of his head so that he may follow the doctor as Xamar goes about his work.
**"Your own master, hmph? That sounds rather… *appealing*. Most appealing, indeed."**
The Prince lays his head back, contemplating the medic's experience and how it related to his own. He remained quiet for a long moment before preparing to speak, but as he does so Lyle bursts in with his impromptu offer to the Khil. Anazider grinned at the man's back as Lyle left as quickly as he came.
**"But! As appealing it may sound, I have made a promise, and must continue my conduct in a Jedi-ish fashion. And it appears you've become rather popular, my good doctor."**

**"Of course, Master Xamar. Lets not keep him waiting."**
Anazider bows to the doctor, and motions for him to lead the way. As the Khil escorts the Prince outside, he falls in step beside him.
The young nobleman mulled Xamar's words as they idly progressed through the massive freighter. What the Khil had said struck a cord and resonated, and Anazider pondered his thoughts on the matter as they walked.
***"Master to none. Master Mellisani promised much the same when she sent me off to the temple. Xamar and Kyta seem well-adjusted enough, so if becoming a Jedi is the key to being unfettered, then why did they leave? Most intriguing."***
Musing silently, Anazider frowned but thought fondly of the Codru-ji jedi master. She had been a remarkable woman, and didn't seem one for lies and subterfuge. Before he realized it, he and the Khil had entered the lounge where they were greeted with the scene of holographic monsters assaulting each other.
**"I suppose we shall."** He muttered lowly and to himself, before he moved over to the couch and settled in with a languid stretch.

Picking up his gear, he starts to walk over to where the others might be, settling down to work with the armor.
((IÂ´ll just sit down somewhere and take 20 on the check. I canÂ´t find it in the rules that I canÂ´t take 20 on an untrained check, just that I canÂ´t take 10. And I suppose we might have 20 hours on the trip))

As the game between Lyle and Xamar progresses, Anazider finds himself growing rapidly more bored by the moment. He sat in a corner of the couch, his delicate chin resting in the palm of his hand, as he watched the play unfold. It wasn't so much the game itself, Anazider loved dejarik for its many cerebral applications, but more so the ambiance.
Over the last few years, the Prince had come to play the game in seedy cantinas, overlooking the galaxies most extravagant beaches, and countless other exciting locales. Even the dusty meditation chambers of the Jedi Temple had an atmosphere that spoke volumes. And through no fault of their own, Lyle and Xamar played in a mundane and pedestrian fashion.
**"If you gentlemen will excuse me."**
Anazider flowed to his feet and sketched a hasty bow before he departed. He wandered the corridors of the massive transport for long moments, finding himself back in the cargo hold with the unmarked containers, before an idea struck him and a sad grin crept across his lips.
Soon, he found himself before the portal leading to the bunk that Koyi kept to herself. He knocked thrice, lightly.
**"Ah! It is… Anazider,"** The Jedi Prince decided to forgo any and all titles, instead his voice held a neutral pleasantness, **"And I wished to… apologize."**

Koyi was sitting in the middle of the floor of her room, meditating and trying to remember what she'd been taught as a youngling. But she soon gave up, and had retrieved her weapons and were cleaning them, Now there was the subtle scent of oil in the air. when Anazider came and knocked on her door.
Gathering up the Force, she unlocked the door. "Apologize for what? Come in." She replied. The Twi'lek girl was wearing a tube top, and a short pair of shorts.

Anazider glanced at Koyi's attire, and sniff the scent of oils on the air, and came very close to the Jedi principles he was trying very hard to adhere too. With two long-leg strides he was into the center of the room.
**"I came to apologize for my manner earlier. I've a habit of preening to beautiful women, and when I saw you storm off earlier I thought I may have offended."**
Looking about, the Prince spied the weapons in assorted stages of cleaning and nodded to himself with an appreciative eye.
**"I suppose I will deliver this for the gent that offered you his arm as well. He seemed to mean well, although he may not have had the faculties to express it."**

"Don't worry about it Anaz." Koyi replied to the fallean. running a cloth though the barrel of the rifle she'd taken for the Ubese woman. "I was simply avoiding the medical exam from the "Doctor." If He had any real credentials he should be working at a hospital. And a simple healing Trance will deal with my injuries."

The Prince was torn between disdain for the twi'lek's lack of proper etiquette for addressing him, and respect for her direct way of speaking and an unidentifiable thrill at her treating him with such familiarity. He perched on the edge of a small writing table bolted into the wall as he watched the security-officer-turned-Jedi clean the weapon, with some fascination.
**"Doctor Xamar is actually rather skilled, and the examination wasn't invasive. And I've been told that there are things that not even meditation can cure…"**
Anazider trails off as she smiles at him, but he returns the smile just as brilliantly and shakes his head.
**"I've found that there is more to the good doctor than what one may garner at first blush. Xamar, and likely Kyta as well, have had some measure of training with the Force, being former members of the Jedi Service Corps. They decided to strike out on their own, reveling in the freedom it affords. Masters of their own destiny."**
Rocking back on the table, Anazider gives the small writing table a few testing leans before he folds his legs up on it, appearing like a very large, very long-legged, reptillian bird of some kind.

She should know something about the Service Corp. Koyi herself hadn't been selected to be a padawan, and was going to be shuffled off to the Jedi Service Corp, but had lucked out and took a position with with the Courasant Security Force instead.

The Prince picks a fleck of imaginary lint from his expensive Jedi robes, then smiles and looks Koyi directly in the eye when she looks up.
**"So it is that I offer this: Take advantage of the opportunity with the Jedi. Wring as much from it as you can, and enjoy the experience; it is what I am doing. I guarantee you will find yourself hesitating less and less by the day, as it all becomes natural."**
As Koyi continues to clean the rifle, a polishing rag hovers up in front of her, offering itself in the next step of the cleaning process. The Jedi Prince offers the security officer his most charming smile, and a wink.

Jace listens to some of the others talk about this or that. Then he hears Cole yell at Sor. Jace turns in the direction the sound came from. "Hey Cole we got a game going on here can it wait abit?" Jace knew that Sor wanted to play, sure he was good with computers but sabbac is sabbac rude to inturpued a game after all.

After four days in hyperspace, various card games, dejarik games, and various other sundries, The group is told that the ship's getting ready to exit hyperspace into the Adran system.
Anyone in the cockpit is treated to the sight of exiting hyperspace, as the starlines shrink back down to the pinpoints that they normally look like as the *Wyr* exits the extradimensional anomaly that is hyperspace and enters real space.
Kyta moves her four hands over the control panel with practiced expertise, setting the course for the B'Knos colony. She stopped however, when she noticed a flashing red light on one of the readouts.

A voice garbles over the ships comm system. It sounds scared.

The voices stops and is replaced by a second voice on a different frequency.

Once we have finished with this ship, we will move along side yours and *escort* you to the mining settlement. Is that understood? Move and you&#39;re space debris.

Kyta's eyes grow wide and her hands begin flying all over the control panels with increasing speed before she finally grabs the pilot's yoke with two of her hands and hits the intercom with a third.

"Very true, especially when we're going to a place where tensions are already high from the problems their having. Its best to be ready in case we get into a pinch," he says in support of Zeyn as he speaks to both Anazider and Koyi.

Anazider comes gliding into the cockpit, the picture of royal serenity. With a quirked eyebrow, the Prince glances over the consoles, the furiously working Kyta, Koyi, and whoever else may be present.
Frowning, the negotiator moves to the communications station and slides into the seat, shaking out his long silver hair before donning the accompanying headset and tapping into the ship-to-ship communications.
**"Mining Guild patrol, this is transport ship *Wyr* inbound to B'knos colony with foodstuffs and other trade goods, and are running behind schedule. We were not made aware of any customs checks this far out from colony space, please state your intentions."**

He pauses for moment to get his bearings and turned left towards the nearest port gun.

Zeyn points towards the Jedi.
===============================================
As the chaos of battle erupts, Zeyn immediately starts to feel uneasy. There was a reason he had never considered joining the navy, and instead remained in the infantry. He liked his opponent where he could see him. As a result, he had very little experience on what to do aboard a ship. He decided to stick around to see if someone needed help somewhere.

Haden watches as chaos unfolds around him, the possibility of his impending doom the foremost on his mind.
While any normal man would've panicked at the thought, Haden had lived a lifetime in fear of death; it was second-nature and he had learned to set it aside. Focusing on the here and now, he set his sights through the cockpit window at any incoming hostiles. He did not have anything to contribute to the moment, but he sensed his time would come.

(Ok, first off, Zeyn's and Cole's kits are installed without problem.)
As Koyi activates the shields, she gets a quick summary of the ship's systems (see the NPC thread). She notices immediately that the ship was modified beyond simply a faster hyperdrive motivator. It also has higher shields.
(SR 30)
Koyi notices on the sensors that there are four ships in the distance, two of them seeming to be in a docking position. The other two, being closer, are identified first as Cutlass-9 Patrol Fighters (SOTG p. 132)

If you&#39;re lucky, the Mining Bosses will agree to *allow* you to leave with your ship. **If** you&#39;re lucky.

Kyta apparently over hears the conversation and mutters various phrases in Codruese under her breath. While no one around her understands, the sentiment is obvious.

Kyta looks up at Sor for a second and then back at her screens. One of her four hands motions towards the empty co-pilot's seat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Cole climbs into the gunner's seat and straps himself in, he begins to look over the controls and the sensor information relayed from Koyi's post in the ship. As Cole stares at the information, he realizes that a pattern he's seen before is unfolding in the flight arcs of the fighter. The ships are going to try and approach from the dorsal and ventral sections of the ship, thus cutting down on the angle of available shots from the port and starboard guns. It occurs to him that if he relays this information, Kyta could alter the angle of the ship at the right moment, catching the fighters off guard.

While his tone is cheerful, one look at the falleen shows a righteous indignation coloring his otherwise handsome countenance. Anazider begins searching for any information related to the Merchant's Pearl and the Mining Bosses, attempting to figure out just who the Miners are attacking and who is giving orders on the ground. He reestablishes the commlink.
**"Mining Guild patrol, this is transport ship Wyr. We state that we are on a peaceful mission of commerce, and any attacks made upon this vessel during said mission will result in sanctions, per the Republic Intergalactic Trade Bylaws, subsection 14, paragraph…"**

His silvered words continued to flow most effortlessly.

Cole looks over the controls to the gun torrent he is in as he looked over the instruments. Seeing the angle that the enemy ships are approaching from he quickly opens his com to the captain.
"Captain Kyta, this is Cole. It looks like they are going to approach from the dorsal and ventral sections of the ship in an attempt to keep the starboard and port guns from getting any shots on them. Awaiting your orders captain. I am ready in the other gun torrent."
He grows silent for a moment as that same familiar feeling washed over him. It was the feeling he always got just for battle as his adrenaline began to pump through his veins. In his anxiousness, a song that he was taught during his combat training began playing in his head as he began hum the tune.

Koyi's initial sensor sweep reveals that each of the fighters is armed with two types of weapons.
It occurs to Anazider, after he'd made his statements about by-laws, that he **wasn't** in Republic space at that moment.
However, it apparently didn't occur to the other pilots because in a few seconds, the pilot came back on.
> **Patrol wrote:**
>
> Attention *Wyr*. Ummm&#8230; we&#39;ve still got our orders, so we **ask** that you lower your shields and prepare to be boarded. We will have one of ours board your vessel and pilot it to the colony mines. We&#39;re sure that you&#39;re carrying supplies, but we&#39;re blockading B&#39;Knos at the moment. That&#39;s actually what the *Merchant&#39;s Pearl* is in trouble for, running the blockade. We&#39;ll come alongside you and escort you to a rendezvous point where you will be boarded. Stand by.

Kyta responds to what she hears with more Codruese cursing.
While it sounds as if the pilots haven't changed their minds too much, Koyi, Jace, and Cole all notice on their scanners that the fighters have turned their backs to the *Wyr*, leaving themselves open to a sneak attack.
Kyta nods her head and Cole hears her over the intercom.
> **Kyta wrote:**

> Roger that, Cole. Sor, give me a ten percent burst from the port attitude thrusters on my mark. Three &#8230; two &#8230; one &#8230; **MARK!**

Working together, Kyta and Sor manage to rotate the ship along it's axis, bringing the port and starboard guns into perfect allignment with the patrol fighters.

"Rodger." Sor quickly and efficiently went about the process of preparing the operations the captain had requested, saying as he does so, "Ten percent burst from port thrusters...ready!" Then, when the Kyta gave the word, he executed the command with perfect timing. As all this happens, Sor reflects on how glad he is that this ship has a copilot's seat. Otherwise, he would most likely have been without anything useful to do throughout this battle. And Sor is the type of person who hates not being able to join in a battle.

**"Fight, flight, or fold captain. If we fight, we keep your ship and have a chance of saving the Merchant's Pearl, but then we would have to risk running the blockade.

The Prince reclines in his seat and laces his fingers in his lap. He wears a smirk as a stray strand of silvered hair falls over his eye.
**"…We submit and hand over the Wyr. It will guarantee that we reach the colony, and leave us a possible chance of recovering her later, but does nothing for the Pearl. With all three, our cover is likely blown. Hmm… Decisions are what make life interesting, are they not?"**

Seeing the ships change their positions he realized that this was the best opportunity to strike. His humming turned to song as he gripped the controls. Cole aimed the gun torrent at the ships that turned their backs to them and open fire.

Sor's piloting skills show themselves off as he deftly redirects energy from certain systems to give the engines a much needed boost at the right moment, thus allowing the *Wyr* to match the moves of the patrol craft for a few vital seconds, allowing Cole and Jace to fire off shots before the craft could move.
Cole's chanting does the trick as it focuses him. The shots from his double laser cannons connect with the ship, causing the ship to jump a bit. However, the ship keeps on flying.
Jace's shot, however, misses the fighter by several meters. The shot, causes the fighter to juke and begin to come around to make a run with the *Wyr*.

Sor, get ready to give me a Bootlegger Turn. I want you to kill the forward thrust in three &#8230; two &#8230; one &#8230; **NOW!**

Sor kills the forward thrust with perfect precision as Kyta spins the *Wyr* on it's axis while continuing to move in the same direction as before, but from the ship's point of view, they are now spinning starboard ways, lining Jace's shot up perfectly.
Cole's shot ripped through space, and missed the target by several hundred meters, **not** causing the patrol craft to slide over any.
But, it didn't matter, Jace's shot found it's mark anyway. Jace would know that the problem with those old cutlass-9 fighters, they have this nasty tendency to get all pyrotechnic if you hit the fuel cells at the wrong angle. Such a shame.
But they make such a pretty explosive while the oxygen lasts, ... don't they? The cutlass that Cole had managed to hit earlier was now an expensive pyrotechnic quickly dissipating in the vacuum of space.
The second cutlass decided it was time to open up into the *Wyr*, and began firing everything it had. The laser cannons hit the shields, which briefly flared out before cutting back in. Fortunately the ship's thick armor took the rest of the blast with no damage to the ship at all. However, the shields are now reading to Koyi at 75% (SR = 15/20).
Everyone in the ship felt the shock and got thrown around a bit. A flashing red light on Koyi's terminal indicates something to the Twi'lek soldier.
The pilot's locking onto the *Wyr* with something. Something explosive.

He didn't like how this was going at all, and it showed. They had violated the sovereignty of the miners, fired first, and evidently placed themselves in mortal peril.

"**There's no reason to attack the miners unless they provide evidence or intent to abuse or harm their prisoners.

Over the comlink in the cargo bay, Zeyn, Lyle, Haden and Xamar hear Kyta's voice.
As Koyi works furiously on the control panel to recharge the shields, she is temporarily distracted by the flashing red light on her console, indicating that the patrol craft has locked onto the *Wyr* with a concussion missile launcher. The shock of what she sees prevents her from fully putting her attention on raising the shields. However, the shields go up anyway.

</details>

 (SR 20/20)
Jace's laser cannon blasts a beam of destructive energy ... that misses the cutlass by only a few meters.
As Koyi looks at the sensor console, she sees a quick burst of light as something leaves the cutlass and heads towards the *Wyr*. The missile streaks towards the ship at an extreme velocity. Everyone in the cockpit and the gunnery stations can see the missile head straight for the nose of the ship (what with it currently coasting backwards).
The missile strikes the nose of the *Wyr* with an explosion that rocks the entire ship. Everyone who is not strapped in to their stations is hit hard and thrown about the area. Those strapped in feel it too as the g-forces strain them against their crash webbing. Alarm klaxons sound all over the ship as systems strain under the pressure of the explosion. (Original damage = 106 - SR (20) = 86 - DR (30) = 56 total damage. SR now at 15/20. No dip in the condition track.)
As the ship shakes about, Kyta screams to no one in particular.

Looking out of the front window, Kyta points out the asteroid belt to Sor. With a smile on her lips, she kicks the ship into full throttle. Again, anyone not strapped down is thrown around as the g-forces kick in with the ship's thrusters. The *Wyr* will reach the asteroid belt in about six seconds.

From the gun torrent's window Cole noticed that the Wyr getting closer to the asteroid field. He tilted his head to one side in wonder as he kept his eyes out for the last ship they were fighting. Cole wanted to find a position or angel that could give him a better chance of hitting the ship.
**Is she doing what I think she's doing?** At first he watched in surprise as he watched the asteroid belt coming closer. Then a smile creased the corners of his lips as he nodded to himself.
"Yeah, I think she is. I like this woman. She's got mandokarla." he said using the Mando'a word for one who has the "right stuff", showing guts and spirit, the state of being the epitome of Mando virtue.
He looked at his seat to make sure that he was strapped in and checked his sensor for position of the other ship. Cole then glanced down at the switch to make sure it was in set on auto fire and nodded to himself as if to confirm his answer to someone.
"Alright, letâ€™s do this." he said to himself.
His eyes narrowed on the targeting screen as he focused on the last ship. The chant he'd stopped only a few minutes ago started to beat in his heart again. Except now his blood was filled with adrenaline and his mind remembered another chant he'd bean taught while in the military. He rubbed his sweaty palms on his pants and grasped the controls again as he began a new chant. Cole thought the fight was enough to get his blood flowing but now with the asteroid belt closing in he found himself even more pumped as the tribal chant he'd learned so long ago began to flow from his lips.

As Kyta and Sor enter the asteroid field, giant chunks of rock, about the size of the *Wyr* start to fly past at differing speeds. Some are easy to avoid, others, ... well, let's just say that any pilot who is actually not describable as institutionalizable would know better than to go anywhere near them. But, that's what makes Kyta such a successful pilot. She doesn't care what the institutions think of her.
The *Wyr* starts diving and bobbing and weaving amongst the asteroids, the strain on the engines is rather loud as the engines scream their protest at being dragged through such a terrible ordeal.
After Anazider's words rang out through space towards the other ship, the Falleen noble heard the other pilot begin to sputter and stutter about regulations.

As nobody was feeding Jace new information, his shot was entirely on him, and the sudden jostling around of entering the asteroid belt made it difficult for the man to make his shot. Instead, the blaster shot off into the infinity of space.
Cole's shots filled the area with bolts of deadly energy. A few of them actually managed to strike at the cutlass, but seem to be absorbed by the shields, though the shields did seem to weaken for a moment on the sensor boards.
As the miner pilot enters the moderately dense asteroid field, it turns out that he's not as good a pilot as he apparently thought, or he was too busy dodging blaster bolts to pilot properly, or maybe he was too busy talking to his superiors on the comlink to pilot properly. Any way you look at it, he drifted a little too close towards an asteroid and side swiped it at full speed. Anyone looking at sensors will know that the miner's shields popped like a bubble and are completely gone. The cutlass's engines also took a fair amount of damage and the ship has slowed down to barely flying speed.
Turning around, the miner pilot turns and begins to limp his way out of the asteroid field in an attempt to get out of the way of the flying rocks of death. However, it's obvious that his ship isn't responding as well as it should. There's no telling how easily he's going to be able to get out of the asteroid field.
He could die in the process.

"Damn it!"

He pivoted the gun torrent in position for another shot when he noticed the enemy shipâ€™s shield burst as it took a hit from one of the asteroids. Focusing on the enemy ship for a moment, Cole lined up the crosshairs to make the next shot. However, when he saw that the pilot ship was problems controlling the ship it was clear to him that they would not have any problems with him anymore. Cole removed his finger from the trigger. There was no honor in killing someone who could not defend himself. He took this moment to rest in case there was any more attacks as he watched the pilot try to navigate his way through the asteroid field.
Cole looks to the com and saw it was still opened. He spoke throughout the Wyr as he made his suggestion to everyone in the ship.
â€œI am in agreement with the Jedi. I think we need to get him out of there and maybe onto the ship. Maybe we can gain some trust and even learn their side of the story. I donâ€™t know how much we would get out of him but itâ€™s worth a try.â€

It's obvious that Case doesn't know Koyi's approaching.
As Anazider ponders on how to best save the fighter, it occurs to him that there are three trained Jedi on the ship, and three members of the corps who have also been trained at some point or another. If all six were to work together, they could probably move the entire *Wyr*, not to mention a smaller fighter ship. <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

He slowly looses the breath and takes another, relieving this one even faster as a contorted grimace begin to mark his face. Breathing rapidly now, he extends his second hand to aid the first, making a motion as though holding the fighter from afar. Strained, he seemed unwilling to buckle under the mental effort.

As the five Force Sensitives reached out into the black of space, distance seemed to shrink as the lines that connect all things in the universe were pulled and tugged. Haden could feel the power of the Force, amplified by the other four (Lyle apparently got lost), boosting his own considerable powers.
As he felt the power course through his body, he felt the mass of the fighter ship, drifting out of control in space. The ship actually tried to resist what was happening. The pilot in the other shuttle was trying to wrest control of his vessel from Haden's Force power.
But, it was all in vain. The ship stopped moving for a second as Haden adjusted his *grip* on the fighter before hurling it out of the asteroid belt. The ship moved itself completely out of the belt, in a perpendicular line to which way its thrusters were pointed. The fighter sailed past the last asteroid and into freedom ... before its engines sparked and completely shut down. Apparently the stress of fighting the Force was too much for the battered fighter. Haden, being still boosted in the Force, can feel that the pilot's ok, he's just not going anywhere any time soon.
And, neither is the *Wyr* if they don't leave the asteroid belt soon. Problem is, Kyta's collapsed from the exhaustion of trying techniques she hadn't tried in a while. Xamar is wobbly on his knees, and Koyi doesn't feel too good at the moment either, though her's will pass momentarily.
The asteroids are still sailing around the *Wyr*. And who knows when one will hit.

(occ: Lyle will unleash a move object on any asteroid that comes near the ship. Being that it be bigger than small size, and move light object on anything smaller since Hayden is recovering.)

"Ok, very impressive, you've KOed our captain to rescue our enemy. What's say we get out of here now, eh?" Sor jumps into the pilot's seat and takes control of the ship fully. He sets course for the *Merchant's Pearl*, using the most direct path to get there. "Now you guys need to get back to the airlock and get ready to jump over to that ship. We're late for our appointment with them."

Anazider eases Xamar into his seat at the communications station, and then goes to scoop Kyta. He smiles in admiration at the Codru-Ji captain and her Khil cohort, Sor's sourness not spoiling his good mood.
**"Excellent work, all. Let us see to the Merchant's Pearl, and what we can do to end this dispute."**
He ducks his head as he exits the cockpit with Kyta, taking a sharp turn to deposit her comfortably in the captain's bunk before he makes his way to the airlock. Smirking, the Prince stops in at his bunk and sorts through the massive amount of clothes in his wardrobe before coming to the chest's secret compartment, where he uncovers a silver-plated sporting blaster. This he belts on as well, and then he's sweeping down the corridors of the Wyr, intent on joining the boarding party.

Jace walks onto the brige. Looks around at what was going on. He sees Sor in the pilots seat. "What happen the Captain get hurt?" Jace moves over to Sor. "You sure you can fly this thing old man. It is alot different then a air taxi." Jace was an ok pilot, but even he would think twice about flying this monster. Jace looks around at the controls, then up at the view port the other ship was getting closer. "So time to play our role of heroes. Swoop in and save the day. Oh by the way old man thanks for all the fancy flyin'. There is asertan Lady I would like to get back to. She might be put out if I up and die on her." Jace smiles at the thought of him and Nana together. It was something that he desided was worth making happen.

Cole tapped his fingers impatiently on the side of his controls as he waited for the Jedi to finally do -something- with the stranded pilot.
"Someone going to get that pilo....." Cole stopped in mid-sentence with his jaw agape as his witnessed the ship move out of the asteroid field. It was clear to him that the ship was being aided by something other than its own thrusters. He shook his head in disbelief and sat silent for a moment watching the asteroids float through space. Cole heard many stories from his clan and his father, Adin about how the Jedi could move things through the air but never anything about moving entire ships. It was an astonishing thing to witness. The Jedi clearly were very powerful.
After hearing what Sor said about the captain being knocked out from over the Com, Cole quickly got out of the gunnery chair, and moved with a sense of urgency as he ran through the corridor towards the captain.
As the Captain Kyta came into view Cole knelt down next to her and glanced over to Xamar. â€œDo you have anything to revive her on board?â€ he asked the Khil.

As Lyle focused on protecting the ship, he noticed that several times, while the rest of the group was talking about getting out of the field and saving the *Pearl*, he had to deflect small asteroids away from the ship. He might have had reason to worry about bigger ones, but Sor and Jace soon set the ship in motion towards the assaulted ship.
As Cole arrives at the bridge, he kneels next to Kyta just in time for Anazider to pick her up and drop her off in her quarters. Xamar looked groggily down at Cole before muttering something about medical supplies on the third level of the ship. He then fell promptly asleep, only being kept from falling by the seat's harness.
As Sor and Jace pilot the ship towards the *Pearl*, they can see the other ship still attached to the port airlock, leaving the starboard one open. Now clear of the asteroid belt, the *Wyr* will be at the *Pearl* in a few seconds.

"Old man? I'm no older than you, numb skull." Sor says with his closest approximation to a smile. Over the commlink he says, "Good evening ladies and gents. For those of you not in the know, our illustrious captain is currently incapacitated, and as such I have taken over the vessel. Please don't be alarmed, I am an excellent pilot and have no intention of sending us to an early, fiery death. I would, however, ask that anyone planning on joining the boarding party heading over to the *Merchant's Pearl* make their way to the port airlock and prepare to jump ship. For those really not in the know, the port airlock is the one on the ship's *left*. Thank you and have a nice day." He then switches the commlink back off and turns to Jace saying jokingly, "I hope that lady friend of yours has some decent insurance on you, I've never actually docked with another ship in the middle of deep space before." Despite this, he brings the ship in to dock.

As Sor pilots the *Wyr* towards the *Pearl*, Sor, Jace, and Koyi have a view from the cockpit that shows blaster fire happening on board.
Despite Case's worries, the docking procedure goes off without a hitch. The smaller *Wyr* successfully docks with the larger and bulkier *Pearl* on the first pass, with such finesse that most pilots would call that maneuver a First Kiss, so gentle it was that Sor had to radio down to let everyone know they were docked.
As the door slides open, you find that the outer hatch for the ship is locked shut. The markings on the door tell you that it is a Gallofree GR-75 Transport.

As Haden cuts through the airlock door and kicks it in, the group sees a narrow hallway, leading on for a few meters before widening out and branching off in three directions. Standing in the junction, looking very surprised by the sudden entrance of the heroes, are a Rodian and a Quarren, each wielding blaster rifles. The looks on their faces indicate that they had no idea that a ship had even docked with them.

The Rodian swings his blaster rifle around and aims it at Haden. Pulling the trigger, a massive bolt of energy rips through the air towards the Jedi's chest. Haden moved to deflect the bolt, but the tight constriction of the boarding dock prevented him from fulling moving his arms around. The bolt struck Haden square in the chest and knocking him back into the *Wyr*, and clearing the way for the others to enter. Haden can feel his lungs having trouble breathing, but is able to get back up again, should he choose to do so. (26 points of damage. Critical strike, dude.)

Cole entered the airlock as he watched Haden cut through the Pearlâ€™s door with his lightsaber. The sound of blaster fire caught him off guard as he everything seemed to move in slow motion. It seemed like an eternity had passed before he drew his weapons when in fact heâ€™d actually moved with lightening speed the moment he heard the blast. Cole moved to the fallen Jediâ€™s side to aid him. He knelt down to get a glimpse of Hadenâ€™s wound and noticed the scorch marks left behind from the blast. Cole saw many scorch marks left behind from blasters during his training with his med pack. He recalled that there were many degrees of burn and this particular burn was not good. Everything bit of training came flooding back to him as Cole set the med pack instinctively by his side for easy access then peered up to Zeyn and Lyle.
To Zeyn and Lyle: â€œI need cover while I try and fix him up.â€ He said as he put holstered both pistols and reset the springs in both holsters. Cole briefly peered over at the door where the shot came from before looking down at Haden.
â€œEverythingâ€™s going to be alright.â€ He assured the Jedi then opened his robes to assess the damage. His widened at the extent of the damage but he did not that deter him from continuing. He opened his med pack and grabbed the medisensor to establish the Jediâ€™s condition. As he scanned Haden Cole realized the severity of the wound and looked up to the group.
â€œGo wake Xamar now! Tell him we need his medical skills! That Haden requires **immediate** surgery.â€ There was a sense of urgency in his voice as he spoke.
He glanced down at Haden with concern. â€œHold on! Where getting some help now ok?â€ Cole could do nothing but watch as death began to take hold of the Jedi who heâ€™d seen move with such blinding speed through the plaza in order to help so many innocent people.

Lyle's defenses are quick. Certainly quicker than the Quarren's trigger finger. As the amphibious alien lines up his shot, the volley flies through the air, only to deflect harmlessly against the human's activated lightsaber.
As Cole ran the sensor over the Jedi's chest, the beeping noise that indicated a heartbeat came slower, and slower. Looking down at his patient, Cole could see his breathing becoming slower and more erratic. Haden's eyes clouded over and rolled into the back of his head. In the end, before anyone could even move to get Xamar, the Jedi had died, the sensor's sounds making a continual hum, indicating flatline. It was now too late, nothing would bring back Haden. Nothing. Any and all Force Sensitives on the *Wyr* felt the death of Haden.
(by the by, Treat Injury's a full round action for First Aid, so you couldn't reset the springs yet)
Anazider's words seem to have an effect on the Rodian. His knees obviously tremble a bit, and Lyle and Anazider can feel the fear that has now crept into the Rodian's heart. The aim of his rifle now shakes, just a bit.

After Haden was dropped Lyle felt something swell in him like a fire, all he wanted to do was to let out this burning sensation deep within him. The pure crash of sadness that Lyle felt through the force when Haden died was unbearable. The thought never paced his mind before, why would a Jedi die like this, itâ€™s not fair, this mining pirate, thug, thief, killer shot and killed a Jedi. Fury boiled in the young man and he flew into a vengfull fit and through himself and the Quarren, taking a swing from the ceiling to the floor, trying to cleave the alien into two symmetrical pieces of cauterized, searing flesh.

As Koyi descends the final stairs to the lower level of the *Wyr*, she sees Haden, his chest with a blackened crater in the middle where his heart had once been. Cole kneels over the body, his attempts to save the young Jedi futile. Koyi is able to feel the anger radiating from Lyle, and sees the power that Anazider is wielding against someone on the other side of the door. Zeyn is standing there, ready to move as soon as the door clears out.
The Rodian, shaking in fear, levels his blaster rifle at Anazider, obviously intent on cutting the Falleen down. Despite the Rodian's fears, his years of training ring true as the blaster bolt catches the Falleen Jedi in the arm, burning through his flesh down to the bown. (16 points damage, -1 on condition track)
Zeyn is unable to get through the door (as is everyone else as long as Lyle and Anazider block it.
As Lyle flies forward towards the Quarren, the hate and rage boiled inside of him. The Quarren raised his blaster rifle in a futile attempt to shoot at the Jedi, but nothing could save the mining mercenary from the power of a rage driven Jedi padawan. As the Dark Side of the Force flowed through Lyle, he knew that he had crossed a line. He had allowed his grief and his hate to drive him and empower him. And, now, the Quarren was going to pay for it. As Lyle brought the blade down in a slash, the Quarren managed to step back just enough to avoid having his body cleaved in two. However, the blade still sliced him from head to waist, leaving a line of burned flesh burrowed in his skin. The Quarren fell back, staggered by the ferocity of the attack. As he fell to his back on the deck plating, Lyle could see and feel something flashing through the Quarren's eyes.
Fear. (1 DSP to Lyle)
In fact, the Quarren was so shaken up by the attack, that his blaster bolt hit the ceiling instead of the Jedi now descending on him. Somewhere in the ship, an alarm rang out.
Anazider demonstrates that his specialty is in words and diplomacy, **and** intimidation. He is not, however, as good in a fight. And it shows. The burning in Anazider's arm is enough to throw his aim off. The stun energy dissipates harmlessly into the wall plating behind him.

Cole stared down at Hadenâ€™s body in disbelief as he managed to put the medisensor back in the med pack at his side. This was the first time heâ€™d ever lost someone while taking care of their wounds. Even though the Jediâ€™s wound was beyond his skill to heal Cole felt responsible some how. He was told that this day would come sooner or later by those who trained him. Yet, despite all the training and constant drills there was nothing that could prepare you for the feeling that followed. There was a numbness that washed over him as he looked down at the Jedi heâ€™d only known for a short time. In those moments Cole learned that not all Jedi were what his clan believed them to be. Theyâ€™d shown that they could be selfless in their actions as heâ€™d seen in the plaza on Coruscant.
In his numbness Cole could hear the events unfolding around him as though he were in a tunnel. He took a deep breath to calm himself yet he could not escape the feeling that was simmering in his gut. The Mando seemed withdrawn as he slowly rose with a sneer upon his face. Turning in the direction of the Pearlâ€™s airlock door Cole fixed his gaze on the Rodian who was now shaking in fear. In his eyes there was a terrifying focus as he slowly drew both pistols and switched them from stun to kill.

In her attempt to shoot through the slightly occupied doorway, Koyi's shot missed the Rodian and hit a wall panel instead, leaving a smoking crater.
The Rodian leveled his blaster rifle at the Falleen for a second time, still shaking with fear. However, his fear still keeps him from making the shot and it goes wide.
Zeyn, taking the spot by the door that Lyle had just vacated, lined up his blaster rifle, but was unable to make the shot.
As Lyle stood over the Quarren and raised his lightsaber over head, he felt the dark side brush through him briefly. However, it may not have mattered to him much after the lightsaber neatly cut the amphibious alien's head off.

As the Rodian stares in fear at the two Jedi bearing down on him, he is certain that he will soon be killed. The fear ripping through him makes his hands shake and tremble. The trembling is apparently bad enough so that his shot still goes wild. Seeing that his shots are missing, and the Jedi are preparing to pounce and kill, the Rodian stands up and pulls the frag grenade off of his belt, preparing to prime the charge.
Koyi's prepared shot still misses, despite her preparing. Having to aim through the crowd gathered at the gate messes up her shot.
As the Rodian grabs his grenade, Zeyn sees the weapon and shouts out a warning to Lyle.
> **Zeyn wrote:**
>
> Lyle! Look out! Grenade!

Not sure if his ally would be harmed, the long years of battle experience cause the Feeorin to squeeze off a shot at the Rodian. It too misses.
As Lyle expertly flips over the dead Quarren and lands next to the Rodian, his grief grips him enough so that he too misses the Rodian, his saber swinging through the space that the miner had previously occupied.
Seeing blaster bolts fly all around him, and lightsabers swinging through empty space, Anazider steps forward with words of menace that strike fear into the heart of the Rodian. His hands begin to tremble so much that he drops his blaster rifle and hits his knees. If the Rodian were capable of crying, he would be. The smell of bodily fluids has not escaped the notice of any of the heroes surrounding the Rodian. The shaking Rodian still has the grenade in his hands, though Anazider notices that the grenade hasn't been armed yet.
As Jace slices into the computer systems with relative ease (it's obvious that these shippers don't spend too much on computer security), he gets an overview of the ship hovering in front of him in 3D holograms. He can see where the *Wyr* is docked with the *Pearl* and where his friends are standing. He can also see Haden's dead body lying on the floor of the lower compartment as well as a dead body lying just inside the *Pearl*. He can tell that Anazider and Lyle are standing over the only unidentified living body in the area. However, he can also see that six more unidentified figures are heading for the air lock right at that moment. They should arrive inside of twelve seconds.

There are many legitimate reasons to have been on board this particular freighter at this particular time. And then there are the reasons in which Indra was actually here. She was on her way to her next assignment, a scouting mission deep in the Unknown Regions, a heavily overgrown planet where mysterious disappearances of every previous group had been sent before. Therefore, why not call for someone trained in the ways of Kashyyyk, if you couldn't get a Wookiee themselves? This particular freighter was just one hop, before catching another, and then another, before her final shuttle to the planet. It was supposed to be a quiet ride.
"The force works in mysterious ways," grunts the woman in a well educated drawl to herself.
Indra's eyes slowly, casually glide over the two guards the miners had graciously provided the little group she was staying with, before the rest had run off towards the airlocks. *Are they done with the raid? Have they found what they wanted? Or is there more going on here, I wonder?* thought the woman to herself as she casually slid her hands down her arms, slowly uncrossing them. Then her gaze when back to the group, seeking out at least one other who might be thinking the same thing as she. There were, after all, only two guards left, and they had not been checked for weapons. Her blaster carbine was not far, her knife was near, and she carried a few other persuasive elements with her at all times.
If there was but one more being ready and able, then the two guards would be little difficulty. If it was herself alone, then it would be a little difficult and there might be collateral damage. And collateral damage was always unpleasant. You had to stay behind, and ... talk to people.
That thought alone made Indra growl in the back of her throat in annoyance as Lokyskek had so often done during her training. An odd noise coming from human physiology, garnering her a few odd looks. But Indra paid no attention to those looks. She was used to them by now.

Gand sits up as his multi-faceted eyes open, scanning the room through the angular lenses. His tri-fingered hand grasps at his rifle which was placed on the floor nearby and he effortlessly retrieved a curved knife from it's resting place, snapping it into place underneath his weapon's barrel. Gand notices the woman nearby and then the two guards, he wasn't entirely sure how he ended up here. It seems his memory was still playing tricks. In fact, he was somewhat surprised to still have his weapon, complete with spare ammunition, stowed in small pouches attached to the side of the Slugthrower rifle.
Finished with preparing the rifle, Gand stands up finally loading a clip into his slugthrower and glancing at the woman, motioning towards the guards with his left hand.

Eyes fall upon the Gand and Indra gives a faint nod, before letting her eyes dart to a storage box stowed away up above an innocent's head. Then the woman tilts her head towards the guards again. Shifting her position, Indra slowly pulls out a stun baton from where she secreted it within her jacket, with a roll of her shoulders. It would do in a pinch, after all. A flick of Indra's hand is given towards Gand, signalling that she wants to get to that secured case, before she signals to the guards, tapping the baton on her leg, not having turned it on just yet.
First the guards, after all.
One last nod is given to the Gand, and then Indra begins to attempt to manuever herself into position towards the guards.
((OOC: Hopefully, this is how it will go. Indra will let Gand fire first, then come in with the stun baton and attack. Don't want to let either of them get a signal out to the other miners. So ... stealth, I suppose, first. Then an attack. It's been a while since I've done SAGA.))

An exasperated hiss escapes from the Prince's lips as he holsters his blaster and snatches the grenade out of the Rodian's hands.
**"Give me that!"**
Anazider levels his lightsaber at the miner, turning away from the Rodian to peer down the corridor from where the approaching clamor originates. He hefts the grenade in the palm of his hand, his eyes narrowed and his lips curled into a sneer.
He has failed thus far, and that grates at the Jedi more than anything. His eyes stray towards Haden's prone form, and the grip on his lightsaber tightens.

The Rodian looks trembling at the two terrifying Jedi before him. The look in his eyes tells them that the fear has reduced him to a simpering weakling. With his lip quivering, he offers the grenade to Anazider, the most terrifying of them in his eyes. Anazider now has the grenade, unarmed, in his hand.

With the mercenary turning around in confusion, Indra takes this as her opprotunity.

An eyebrow arches upwards then as the woman's weight shifts again and she readies herself for any other actions the now bleeding mercenary might decide to foolishly take.

He glanced to both of them in frustration as he watched at the Rodian surrendered the grenade to Anazider. His eyes narrowed on the green skinned being in anger. The feeling of Hadenâ€™s death still lingering as fought the desire to level his blaster on the Rodian and kill him where he stood.
He looked to the group. â€œYou can bet there are more coming this way after they heard the blaster go off. We need to either take care of the Rodian and move on or take him prisoner.â€

Lyle stands over the Rodian and takes a glance at what was once a Quarren. How could his simple mission go so wrong. Hayden is dead, he killed a man, and the other Jedi accompanying him is recklessly throwing grenades through a space craft.
*â€œLyle to Anazider, Why in the world would you bother to talk one combatant out of fighting just to whip a grenade down the hall and provoke several others. I thought you were Mr. Suave, not the fodder kind of guy that gets paid to clean up after Banthaâ€™s.â€* 
Lyle was grieving for his lost comrade who showed great confidence and talent in taking down the bad guys. But now that his tolerance for stupidity wore out, Lyle uses his readied action to catch the grenade that Anazider threw, and hold it at a safe distance between the two parties so nobody gets hurt. Hopefully with this action, he can try to fix this event because whoever was in command, in the cockpit, was giving them insane orders and ploting them on a course to get killed by innocents.

She then moves to the side.
As Sor shoved Jace out of the way, he looked down to realize that Jace had actually already done most of the work necessary for the job. Sor was able to punch in the final few commands, triggering the shutting of the doors inside the *Pearl*. The air still needed to be removed, however, and that bit looked like it might be difficult for one slicer to do alone. After all, the ship's computer was naturally programmed to **not** do that.
As Anazider hefted the grenade in his hands for a moment, waiting to throw it down the hall, and Lyle waited to catch said grenade and prevent a mass death, they were both denied as the doors leading to the corridor in question slid shut. They heard several sounds like someone banging on the interior of the door, but the door remained shut.
Mercenary 8, now aware of the ambush that was going on, ran around the crates and spotted the Gand stabbing his friend. Raising his blaster rifle, the merc fired off a shot that missed by a parsec, bouncing harmlessly off of the crates instead of living flesh.
As Indra darted forward and swung with her stun baton, she stumbled a bit on her stepping and missed the merc. <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Mercenary 7, grimacing in pain, fired off another rifle bolt at Gand, trying to end the attacks against himself. However, the screaming pain in his side prevented him from moving enough to swing the rifle around, causing the bolt to harmlessly deflect into the floor.
Gand's luck isn't much better either, as the bolt distracted his mind enough to where the bayonet missed its mark.

*Great, who left this pile of wiring and couplings out in the middle of the cargo area,* thought Indra to herself as she stumbled and missed the mercenary with the stun baton, the powered end of the weapon letting off an eerie hum as it whistled past the intended target. Frowning at her lack of ability to hit the distracted man, Indra considered briefly, shifting with a bit of a spin on her feet to gain a better position to both help the Gand and to keep herself mobile. And then Indra dropped low, this time with a backwards sweep of of the baton aiming for the man's kneecap as it's electrified end hummed in desire to connect with a target.

The sensors show the oxygen levels dropping rapidly as the mercenaries begin to struggle for breath.

As Indra deftly sidestepped the wiring and the mercenary (Merc 8 ), the thug attempted to swing the butt of his gun around and connect with the young woman's head. It missed, however and the mercenary could be heard to say things that would make a Hutt squirm in discomfort.
Indra, however, was better than the mercenary it seemed, as she collided her stun baton with the back of the merc's head. The jolt from the baton spun the mercenary around on his feet and directly onto Gand's extended bayonet. The Mercenary fell with a scream and a squirt of blood as the implement pierced his heart, causing instant death.

Beside the wall, Anazider, Lyle, Cole, Zeyn, and Koyi can hear the mercenaries on the other side, gasping for breath, collapsing and hitting the floor. While there's still noise on the other side, the group can tell that it won't be long now.
Sor can tell, using the sensors, that the mercenaries are passing out, and should be unconscious within six seconds.
As Indra apparently stands astounded by the death she helped create, the mercenary left alive tries to whip his gun around to smack the back of her head, but doesn't even get a chance to get the club strike, that would have no doubt ended the human female's life, off. Gand deftly steps back and fires off a slinker slug. As the computer-enhanced bullet travels through the air, and pierces dead center in the merc's head. There is a stain on the crate behind the man where the bullet exited the skull. The lifeless corpse collapses to the ground.

To the first member of the Pearl she frees she tosses the timer as she begins working on the second, "Looks like we've got trouble. Start freeing your crewmates or check the self-destruct on the ship," she notes without looking up further.

(I'm going to assume that Lyle and Cole did their search before the 18 second mark.)
Cole and Lyle find that the entire crew, consisting of four individuals (not counting Indra and Gand), have all evacuated to the *Wyr*. The only people left on the *Pearl* are the mercs.
As they turn a corner, however, they find Koyi and Zeyn. Zeyn physically shoves Cole and Lyle back away from the engine room screaming,

Indra secures her blaster carbine, and makes certain the last of the Pearl's crew are freed before the woman rises and looks around. Considering a moment, she turns to see if any of the new people coming aboard the Pearl are nearby and addresses them. "I'm sending the crew here aboard your ship for now, and I am going to go as well. I could try to assist, but it would probably be a futile effort as my training has been in other areas," she notes with a nod. Then with the blaster carbine hooked over her shoulder, resting against her back, she urges the rest of the crew down the airlock and follows to the adjoining ship.

The crew answers all questions given to them by Lyle and the others. They talk about how they try to ship needed supplies to the colony on the planet, but the miners in the asteroid belt seem to have the entrance to the system pretty well sewn up. They had been making a medical run when the mining patrol had stopped them in mid flight and boarded, threatening to kill them if any of them resisted.
(any other relevant questions that y'all feel need to be answered, put them in the OOC or PM me.)
After an hour or so of flight from the edge of the system, you come to the colony world of Adran. As you approach, anyone in the cockpit can hear the system patrol asking for verification of the ship's need to land, which is answered immediately by Kyta and the captain of the *Pearl*. After landing under heavy escort, the landing ramp lowers on the lowest level, which the miners run down, happy to be safe and sound now.
As the rest of you exit, you are greeted by the sight of twelve armed guards all of whom are pointing weapons at you. In the middle of the guards, standing with the confidence of a person in charge of a brigade of armed guards, stands a young Nautolan wearing light brown robes with a metallic cylinder hanging from his waist. Lyle and Anazider recognize the Nautolan as Loset Sonem, recently knighted Jedi Knight.

This ... is obviously a situation for someone with a more gifted tongue than hers.

With that, Loset motions for the group to follow him as he turns and walks in the direction of a large palace sitting in the distance. Kyta and Xamar nod, saying that they'll stay with the ship.
Jace notices that the wording of the Jedi was a little strange. He called this situation a *war*, and not a *conflict*. Jace gets the feeling that the Jedi might be taking the mining dispute a little too seriously.

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-31 21:53:55)

As the group walks through the governmental palace, the signs of the conflict are all around. Obviously, the city has been bombed several times as shattered buildings are visible through the windows you pass. Even the palace itself has seen its share of damage as holes in the ceilings and walls show up with some frequency. There are people in the palace who seemed to have made camp in the building. Tents are seen in some corridors as people whose homes were destroyed sought shelter in the palace. The palace guards all seem exhausted and to be suffering from battle fatigue, with blood shot eyes and hands that slightly shake.
After a few minutes of walking, you come to a large pair of doors that are opened for you, admitting the group, along with Loset, into a large room. The room was once lavishly decorated with tapestries and ornamental columns. At the center of the room is a large, round table, made of the same mineral as the columns, giving the entire room a light, gray color. There are a variety of chairs seated around the circular table. Jace recognizes the set up of a council or parliament. A ruling body governs, or governed the colony, not a single being.
The table at the moment was projecting a hologram which filled most of the air above the table. Sor and Indra each recognized the image as that of the Adran system with its various asteroids and planets highlighted in two main colors. Cole recognized the image as a tactical map, with the different colors highlighting the areas of control for both sides. The planet with the B'Knos colony was shaded green, as were several other planets in the system and most of their moons, while the asteroid belt at the system's edge was highlighted red, making an almost full circle around the green section. The area that the group had approached from seemed to be the only unmarked section, a path where the asteroids did not orbit with the same density, creating a narrow vector out of the system. It was obvious that the planet with the B'Knos colony had just barely finished passing this vector. Cole figures out that the transports that had been trying to supply the colony must have used that window to try and sneak past the miner's controlled territory and re-stock the colony.
Also standing around the table are several beings. One of them is a shorter than average, rather pudgy, human. His clothes and bearing indicate to Gand, Jace, and Cole a person of importance, Jace also realizing by the insignia on his shoulders that he was a local leader, maybe even one of the ruling council. Standing next to him and also looking up at the map stands a Devronian female wearing light brown robes with a metallic cylinder hanging from her belt. Lyle immediately recognizes her as Master Ree, who Chancellor Fyor had mentioned in the mission briefing. Standing next to her is a young Ithorian female, also wearing light brown robes with a metallic cylinder attached to her waist. Lyle recognizes her as Padawan Aawaia, recently taken under wing by Master Ree to complete her training.
As the group walks into the room, Loset walks up to Ree and taps her on the shoulder. The two of them whisper to each other for a few moments, with Loset turning towards the group every now and then. Finally, she breaks away from the table and walks towards the group.
> **Master Ree wrote:**
>
> Padawan Landers, so good to see you. I&#39;m glad to hear that the Grand Council has finally decided to take further action in this conflict. We have been without support or even communication for over a week. However, as I look over the team assembled here, could not the council have spared more Jedi? What we need is to bring the full might of the Jedi Order against these miners to teach them to not bomb innocent people, to not start a war with those who are their duly elected leaders. None the less, we must make due. I assume you are here to help out?

As Master Ree continues talking, the short, pudgy man walks up behind the Devronian and nods to the group. Everyone can see that the man is deferring to Ree, even if he is of the ruling class.

> **Loset wrote:**

I have a trained group of volunteers who are prepared to storm the miners&#39; stronghold and tear that place apart. Please, Master. Let us bring justice to these criminals. Surely their recent acts of attacking freight ships and killing Jedi proves my earlier points that they must be dealt with in a definitive manner?

As Loset makes his plea to Ree, Lyle and Jace both get the feeling of anger peeking out from the Nautolan Jedi. Master Ree obviously picks up something as well, as she shakes her head.
> **Ree wrote:**
>
> No, my young padawan. This is no mission for you. You are allowing your feelings to overtake you, and that could blind you at the wrong moment. You might cause more harm than good. Besides, we cannot allow the children of the B&#39;Knos ruling class to be slaughtered in your storming of the stronghold. What we need is for someone that the miners en mass haven&#39;t seen yet. Someone who could slip in and gather information, possibly even rescue the children. If only we could find someone like that.

As Ree finishes her statement, she has slowly turned to where she now faces the group in the eyes.

A smaller hand is placed on Loset's shoulder. The Nautolan turns and sees Master Ree's disapproving look and turns away.

You should address me with the proper respect, young one. I am not someone that you demand information from.
> At the same time, however, you are also correct in that all information is needed right now. So, let us begin. A few months ago, the miners who live out in the asteroid belt and mine the ore began to have demonstrations in their local meeting places. They claimed that they had been forced into labor by the ruling council of the system, that they had become slaves. They began making demands on the ruling council, despite having very profitable contracts with the same. The ruling council met and deliberated over the matter and decided that the contracts were more than reasonable and that much more would mean that the colony would not make a profit, making it in the end unsustainable.
> The ruling council asked for the miners to send a representative to meet with them and to discuss the matter further, especially as to what had caused the most recent unhappiness. Instead, the miners sent bombers and leveled several cities. Most of the ruling council was killed in the attack, except for Lord Nayus here, who was late to the meeting, as usual. This time, though, it saved his life. Once he realized that the miners were in no mood to talk, he sent word to the Republic asking for aid. Unfortunately, the Republic refused. However, the Jedi Council agreed to send myself as well as Aawaia and Loset here to help with the negotiations. To see that this is settled peacefully.
> On our own approach here, we were attacked by miner patrols and barely made it to the planet&#39;s surface alive. I met with Lord Nayus and we agreed that there was no negotiating with someone who simply attacks you at the first possible chance. And, you have to realize, the ruling council has no military aside from the miners. They have served as the colony&#39;s defenders for hundreds of years. With them being the ones attempting this coup, Lord Nayus and I agreed that more military might was needed to level the playing field. Calls were sent out for mercenaries to serve as security agents. The very ones you saw here all belong to the same organization. They have been most helpful in keeping the colony safe.
> Well, a few days ago, Lord Nayus&#39;s daughter was kidnapped, right from the palace grounds. The miners obviously have no respect for innocent lives in this war that they&#39;ve started and only want to end it the fastest way possible, with no regard for who might get hurt in the process. We were going to try and send a small strike force to rescue the girl, but we need information first. The asteroid belt is vast and there&#39;s no way to send the mercenaries to check it out without leaving the colony defenseless.

"Do we have any intel on where she is being held? Any on the people holding her? I would like to go over it if I can." Jace wasn't a much on tactics, but he considered himself a pretty good judge of character, and if he had some information about who they where dealing with he might be able to help out on the plan making.

Nayus nodded his head at Indra.

At Jace's comment, Ree nodded towards Aawaia, who pressed buttons on the control panel for the holo-projector. The image that had been of the system zoomed in on a particularly large asteroid.

All of their ships are stationed there when not on patrol and there are several defensive gun turrets that protect the base from whatever the belt doesn&#39;t take care of. I have no doubt that the princess was taken there. It seems the most logical choice for a holding area.
> As to getting there, I still offer my suggestion of claiming to be a supply ship that was chased by Loset and barely escaped.

"So the bluff huh it could be tricky, and if they know the pilot or any of the crew that they are expecting it could get ugly fast." Jace thinks on it abit. "It is doable. Unless someone is better at then me at bluffing there way through something like that then I will bow out, but sence that is how I make my living I will give ago."
" I will need to know who I will be talking to, and other that a transport captian might know that has dealt with them before." Jace doesn't mean to brag about his abilitys but they have served him well in the past. And the art of the Con is what he does.

Lyle to Ree: *“Master maybe we could get some undercover uniforms to help us in our mission onto the asteroid. Also could you supply our group and the ship crew with some rations or a warm meal before we depart.”*

At the comments by Jace, Ree nodded in agreement.
> **Ree wrote:**

> Agreed. You should know who you are going to be meeting once you get there. The leader of the miner&#39;s faction is a human named Sarn Corelus. He&#39;s lead the insurrection up to this point and is probably the person you need to get in touch with. However, we do not know what part of Mining Control he is in at the moment. That part will be up to you.
> Padawan Landers, I&#39;m sure that we can find you suitable shipping clothing if you think it will help with the subterfuge. Just let me know when you are ready to go.

Ree and Nayus provide any clothing that the group deems would look like shipper's clothing and prepares for Loset to "chase" the group into the asteroid belt. Xamar and Kyta seem glad to be of use again as everyone steps back onto the ship.

"We'll be fine, we don't need uniforms if we are a supply ship as is suggested," notes Indra as she nods faintly. "Let us get going, this seems to be something we'll have to play by ear and hope the Force is with us." With that, Indra offers a deeper bow of her head before turning on her heel to exit the room.

Jace looks at Indra as she says her piece and then exits the room. Leaning over to Sor . "I don't think I want to trust my life to the force, but that lady there is someone I wouldn't mind playing a hand on to with sometime. She might a challenge." Jace has been one to trust his luck and skill more then anything else. He has no problem following orders from others as long as it does get him killed. Turning to the Jedi Master and the other officeals. "I would still like to have the information about the people that we are going to be meeting. If we are to pull this off information might just be the best weapon we have." With that he turns and starts to leave the room.

Lyle listens to everyones conversations eagerly. *"Jace is right, we need more information about the miner's leader."* With that said Lyle heads towards the space craft and awaits for further instructions.
