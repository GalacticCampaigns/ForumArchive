# [Dark Times: Fading Light] Act III [BB]: Corellian Knights

### **Anazider** (2012-10-27 19:46:55)

***"I'm the Jedi, not them! For Force-sake, Kalag, leave them out of this!"***
Ash twists and turns in his sleep, caught in the throws of a very lucid dream. The dream was an old memory, one he had thought buried long ago, but ever since he began his nightly 'excursions' the dream became more and more vivid, and occurred in greater frequency. The Force was trying to tell him something, although what that something was had yet to reveal itself.
***"Too scrawny to make good slave. One more piece of street trash!"***
The Gamorrean squealed and left, as it always did each night, leaving Ash with the smoldering remains of his father curled protectively in front of him. Only a few meters away another man, Regus Lim, bled to death from a vibrobayonet wound to the gut. In the dream Ash collapses, too overwhelmed to remain conscious, and as dream-Ash falls, Frost feels his consciousness slowly return to his control. But before it does he hears a familiar voice, not echoing from the past but instead whispering to him in the present:
*I was a lot like you: struggling between what felt good and what was right. Your mom and your old man helped set me straight, and you see where that got'm…*

---

**"Hey kid, wake the hell up willya?! We've got a job!"**
If Elarc Vel's shouting doesn't jolt Frost awake, her rather rudely opening all of the blinds in his room serves to prod him the rest of the way to consciousness. With one last string of expletives, Vel tromps out of Frost's room and through sleep-bleary eyes the teen sees that the good Captain is dressed in her spacers jacket and scant else. Judging by her jaw-cracking yawns and very un-ladylike bout of scratching, Vel likely woke-up just moments before bursting into Frost's room.
It is just after mid-day and in checking the commlink next to his chronometer, Frost finds that he has a pair of messages waiting from one miss Flareja "Flare" Dil'viv.

*Caught in the tangles of his bedding, Ash jerks and kicks, an external manifestation of the mental torment that plagues him this night as it has on many others. His lips part in a moan of anguish as his father dies before his eyes once more. The nightmare is always the same and he is always so helpless, even in his own mind.
He has not felt this way in a long time, but now he cannot escape it. Almost every night now, it torments him. and worse still this one nightmare is not the end. This horrific vision and the feelings of powerlessness it creates give way, inevitably, to memories of his first weeks on the streets of Corellia after it happened. Alone, lost, and terrified, learning to survive in a harsh world where he knew none of the rules.
The nightmares, predictable as they might be, are no less painful for it. Not when he knows exactly where they lead. Somehow the terror of that knowledge is worse than the memories themselves. It is a place Ash has no wish to go: worse, in some ways, than even the violent, awful memory of his father’s death; in some ways, too, worse than that yawning sense of loss and horror as he felt hundreds of his kind die.
This time though, he is spared by an abrupt waking. But the memory he fears most remains, of course. It will always be there. In the hours of darkness when his subconscious rules, Ash’s greatest sin is never far from the front of his mind.*

Frost yelps as he spasms into rude wakefulness, jerks upright only to find himself bound awkwardly by his linens, and falls from the bed in a confusion of sheets and limbs.
The source of his current discomfort traipses through his room, ignoring his predicament completely and stepping over him to open the blinds, thoughtlessly adding painful light to the equation. She immediately leaves the room, mouthing off as though *she* were the one inconvenienced right now, with Frost left befuddled behind her. He watches her go through sleepy and light-dazzled eyes.
Only after she’s left does he work out what’s wrong with the scene.
“Put some kriffing pants on!” the teen yells after his guardian, flushing red.
“Kriff!” Frost repeats as he worms his way out from the fabric cocoon, then he says it again a third time, quietly and with undisguised melancholy: “kriff...”
He gets to his feet, dressed only in his boxers, and kicks aside the linens as he goes to the window. The boy stares out at the world beyond: at Corellia.
“Why did it have to be here?” he mutters.
He had argued against Corellia, but Vel was adamant. She had contacts here. She could set up shop. Frost had never explained why he didn’t want to come. Maybe he should have.
And yet, in a way facing up to his past helped a little. Plus his knowledge of Corellia’s street gang culture has certainly helped him fit in and make allies. He has not encountered any Moonlight Prowlers though - they had been based in Tyrena, not Coronet - and for that he was profoundly grateful. And, unlike the Prowlers, the Slice Hounds seem to have no darker force guiding their hand. If only back then he had found them instead, but such wishes do him no good now. Choices were made, albeit many were made for him, and none of them can be taken back. He is who he is and he does what he has to.
Frost turns away from the window and crosses the room to the closet, opening it and digging around for a simple set of spacer’s garb, not unlike the set worn by Vel today. Partly worn by her, at any rate. He finds some clean underwear too.
As he changes into his clothes, Frost looks at himself unflinchingly in the mirror on the back of the closet door. Pausing in buttoning up his shirt, the teen traces the red fang tattoos that mark his affiliation with the Slice Hounds, then touches the helix piercings in his right ear, mirrored also on the left side. The movement of his fingers is tracked by purple eyes partly obscured by long snow-white hair. Even now he can’t quite believe what he has become, but, again, it’s all down to the choices he has made. This is his reality now.
Finally dressed and with his hair tied neatly back, Frost now checks his chronometer. He frowns upon seeing the time displayed and resolves, not for the first time, that he will not allow Vel to drag him down into sharing her bad habits any longer. Spotting that there are messages waiting on his commlink, and who they’re from, Frost smiles and sits on the side of his bed to listen.

**"You put on some pants!?! Don't you tell me to pants, I'll pants when I wanna… Kriffin' kid…"**
Captain Vel devolves into unintelligible muttering as he slouches her way out of the room, leaving Frost to his thoughts. From his room, the teen hears a loud thud and a muffled bout of cursing as the same end table attacks the good captain while she's en route to her room. Left to his own devices, Frost quickly dresses and when he checks his commlink he finds himself greeted by a blast of wind noise.
**"Hhheelllloooooo Frost, time to wake uuupppp!"**
'Flare' wasn't a fan of wearing a safety helmet when she rode her swoop, it killed the experience or so she claimed, and so Frost hears the sound of honking speeders and shouting passers-by as the young Mirialan whizzes through the streets of Coronet City.
**"We're going to *Twosies* around 1300, I'm meeting a guy for a bombad deal on a flow booster! Laast one there eats outa the pickle jar!"**
*Twosies* was the nickname of a bar owned by a retired Gran mercenary name Kab Noek. Kab had lost an eye fighting the Confederacy during the war, and although the official name of the bar was the *Grinning Gundark*, *Twosies* had gained a great deal more traction with the locals. Because of the surprisingly good drinks and sector famous "Smuggler's Pie", most of Coronet City's street gangs considered the bar neutral territory; Kab's still-quite accurate blaster carbine also likely played a large part as well. The 'pickle jar' was a jar of pickled creature parts the Gran had collected from his adventures across the galaxy- patrons that could finish one of the squishy 'delicacies' whole were rewarded with a free bar tab for the night, and a courtesy speeder ride to the local emergency room.
The second message shows as having been left thirty seconds after first:
**"Oh yeah: Drako says heya and how much he looovvesss you!"
"No I didn't!"**
The message ends abruptly with a fit of cackling. Frost finds he has little more than half an hour to make it to Twosies, and his best time is twenty minutes. He still doesn't know about whatever mission Elarc was referring to, or where and when it will be, but he has a choice between waiting for Vel, who has likely fallen asleep in her fresher unit if he knows her as well as he does, or rushing to meet his friends.

In the end the choice is an easy one.
"Got something to do!" Frost yells on his way out of the apartment door, "message me the details, I'll meet you there!"
He has no idea if Vel hears him or not, but figures if she needs him she'll get in touch either way. He doesn't particularly feel like helping her with one of her criminal clients today though, He'd much rather meet Drako and Flareja. Vel is many things to him, but there are some roles she simply can't fill. Today, after yesterday's nightmares, Frost is keen to distract himself by spending time with his friends.
Frost suspects the pickle threat is an idle one, but even so he takes pains to arrive at Twosies as quickly as possible. Though he's picked up some bad habits this last year slacking physically is not one of them. Frost is in good shape, and has no trouble covering at a fast jog those portions of his journey that must be accomplished on foot.
Upon arrival he looks around for any sign of Flare's swoop parked nearby, then either way makes his way into Twosies, giving a friendly greeting to Kab if he's behind the bar today and ordering something non-alcoholic.

Frost does indeed find Flareja's swoop parked in front of Twosies; it's a rather ostentatious thing, with several flamboyantly girly-girl touches, all painted in colors matching the Mirialans complexion. Drako's speeder is nowhere to be seen, and as Frost enters the bar Kab gives him a one-eyed wink and slides something deeply purple and fizzling along the counter so that Frost may pick it up without breaking his stride. For whatever reason, the Gran had taken a liking to Frost and his friends, although he was notoriously tough-skinned when it came to the various other lowlifes that frequented his establishment.
*Twosies* has a middling crowd for this time of day, so it doesn't take long to find Flareja who waves both of her hands excitedly when she sees Frost in turn. She sits in a secluded booth that could easily sit at least five, and on the table in front of her is a drink similar to the one Frost is holding. A quick negotiation through the maze of tables and serving droids brings Frost to the booth, and Flareja hops to the side to make room for him to sit next to her.
**"There you are land slug! What took you so long, you're slower'n Drako?!"** 
The Mirialan laughs at her own jokes, and when she does the little black triangles tattooed around her eyes move together, seeming to form one big triangle. 'Land Slug' is the term of endearment Flare has given to anyone that either doesn't ride swoops, or are slower than she is. At the moment there is still no sign of Drako, whomever Flareja is to meet, nor any communication from Vel.

Frost plonks the frothy purple drink down on the table and slides into the booth beside Flareja, greeting his friend with a grin. He takes the Mirialan's ribbing good-naturedly, but not lying down:
"One day I'll show you exactly how well I fly," he promises the girl, "and we'll see who's the land slug then."
The challenge comes out of nowhere - he doesn't think he's ever talked about knowing how to pilot craft before. of course, there are plenty of things he hasn't shared with his friends here on Corellia. They aren't idiots, they know he has history - and they probably suspect it's an interesting and varied one, given some of the skills he's shown them over the last year - but they've never pried.
Frost isn't really sure why he's decided to let this particular fact slip now, of all the times Flare has called him a land slug. Perhaps it's because she said he's slower than Drako.
"If I'm slower than Drako, shouldn't he be here?" he asks, shooting her a questioning look and picking up his glass for a sip.
