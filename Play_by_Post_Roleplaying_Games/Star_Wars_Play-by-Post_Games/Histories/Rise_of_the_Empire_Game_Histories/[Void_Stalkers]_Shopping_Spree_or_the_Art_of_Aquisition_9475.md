# [Void Stalkers] Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-04-01 17:34:07)

The next morning the ship is buzzing with news. Rumor has it tha Senator Garm Bel Iblis of Corellia came aboard. Bel Iblis, Mothma, and Organa have all been locked away in a briefing room working on something. They have been in there for hours. 0900 rolls around and the squadron meets up at the mission briefing. There are several Junior staff officers around talking quietly amongst themselves. They all fall silent when Garm Bel Iblis walks in. He has a strong military look about him and an aura of confidence.
"Lets get this going."
He says gruffly. He scans the room for objections then begins.
"Our supplies are almost non-existant at this point. We must begin to stock pile equipment if we are to have any hope of success against the Empire."
A light green rodian staff officer walks over and hands him a datapad. He reads it quickly.
"Our sources have managed to access the navigation data of several Imperial convoys during the next few weeks. We should be able to ambush at least three before the Empire catches on and changes the nav-data."
He looks at Voidstalker squadron.
"Captain Jax your squadron is tasked with the capture of these convoys. If you are unable to capture then you are to destroy them. This datapad contains the nav-data and time table for the top three highest priority targets. The convoys chosen are lightly gaurded and contain vital equipment to our cause. You are being issued two Y-wings to assist you in disabling the transports. We need these supplies if the Alliance is to have any hope of success. Do you or your squadron have any questions?"
The rodian takes the datapad and hands it to Capt Jax.

Arty had yawned as she walked into the briefing room the next morning, as per ritual, hitting almost every wall on the way there and then walking into the door frame when arrived. She mutters about 'damn walls moving' before taking a seat beside the captin, giving him a weak sleepy smile "morning." After the others had filed in and the briefing started, her head would lay on her arms, she was still listening just relaxing.
Thankfully she and the captin had been together long enough for him to stop hitting her over the head to pay attention when she was...she hated that and he knew it. She was quiet after, rolling everything back over into her head.

Deel arived early for the briefing. It was a habit of his sence he was a kid, allways getting to places before he had to. In the Military it was a good thing sometimes. When Senator Iblis walked into the room things got quiet and serious in a hurry. Then he heard what they where going to do next. Steal from the Empire. *"This job has perks after all."*  He thought to himself. Then there was the prospect of the two Y-wings that where going to added into the mix. Thinking to himself again.*"I wish I had known about those last night. I would had made sure they where ready."* Deel had faith in only his abilitys when came to equipment that they where going to use. It wasn't that there wasn't good mechcanics here, he just liked to make triple sure everything was ready to go.
Deel specks up after the senator is finished. "Sir, how much time do we have before we depart. I would like to check over the ships before we leave."

Walking in just on time Antur strolls in and falls in line. Saluting the fellow officers Antur tucks in his shirt and stands at attention. At the mention of Y-wings Antur perks up "Two Y-wings and a citadel imperials rarely travel without escort what kind of resistance are we looking at? Any back up if we run into trouble?"
Looking over the rest of his squad Antur nods at the new recruits. "Deel is right we should go over the new ships get ourselves familar with them, if we have time run a few flights." Antur rubs his hands together at the thought of piloting a snub fighter. Sleek and fast not sluggish like a transport.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-04-03 18:10:01)

Arty looks up at the the one she thought named was Antur and grins "love to look 'em over but I'm stickin with my trusty gunner position on the citadel if the captin doesn't mind having kill counts on the wall." She glances at the captin and grins, poking him lightly in the arm.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-04-03 18:33:23)

Jordan got up and went to the briefing early. He was eager to serve with Garm Bel Iblis again, seeing as the man was the one that had recruited him to the rebel cause on Corellia. As the senator entered, Jordan offered him a friendly salute and then seated himself to listen to the mission.
Hearing the task laid before them didnÂ´t make him feel uneasy. He had faith in his newfound companions, and would always welcome a change to be a thorn in the empires side. At ArtyÂ´s remark, he looks over at the woman and smiles.
*"Sorry Arty, you get stuck with the ion cannons. I expect to get the upper hand on the kill counts"*

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-03 19:16:20)

Zim arrived to the meeting rather early. He always enjoyed the chance to meet and mingle with everyone. He was engaged in am entertaining conversation with several of the Junior staff officers concerning some of their favorite stories about Sabacc. He noticed the group scurried away when the Senator entered the room.
Never one to sit in the front row, Zim grabbed a seat toward the back of the room, and listened intently to the presentation. If the first mission was "tricky," this one was at a completely different level. Figuring out how to procure the supplies was going to be extremely difficult.
He listened to the questions thrown out by the group. He could have guessed Deel would want to inspect any ship. Like clockwork. The question about expected defenses was important, as was figuring out whether there would be any backup, or if this mission was off-the-books so to speak. He tried to block out the blustering between the group and listen to an answer for the questions.
Zim did ask a couple questions," What sort of supplies will we be acquiring? Do we need to take any special precautions during transport?"

### **zerah** (2008-04-03 20:44:54)

Arty lifts her head to grin at Jordan "So long as it shoots and I can hit something I'm happy, as for -you- getting more counts..well..we'll see how many marks are on the wall at the end." She grins, in answer to the challenge.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-04-04 00:30:54)

Senator Bel Iblis listens to your questions. He frowns slighly at the talk of who will get the most kills.
"Remember people that while the Emperor and his cronies are evil to the core the majority of the Empire are just ordinary people who think they are doing the best they can to keep order in the galaxy. They are men and women just like you fighting for what they think is right. We aren't fighting droids this time around, every stamp you put on you ship is one man or woman who won't be going home to thier families. This isn't some holo-simulation this is going to be a hard, dirty, bloody war with loses on both side."
He pauses for a moment to let his admonishment sink in then continues.
"You have to be ready to leave in the next twelve hours to keep to our time table. Our sources didn't know what kind of escort if any the ships would have. Odds are they will be using Llamda class transports. As far as escorts go the Imperial won't waste any capital ships for transports of the size we are hitting. You might be facing some hyper drive equiped starfighters as escorts. For the time being we have no other ships avaiable for support on this mission. The cargo shouldn't need any special handling as they are primarily mundane in nature. The first target is a shipment of astromech droids and parts. The empire is mothballing them since rumor has it thier new starfighters won't be hyper-drive capable. The second target is a shipment of medical supplies and equipment and the final is a weapoms shipment to an imperial outpost."

"Sir after we hit and disable them what do we do with them?" "We can only Tractor one back at a time with the Voidstalker." Deel is considered of the ware and tear on the ship but what about the shuttles they would be valuable them selves. He figures that they would take over the ships and fly them back but that will take time and the longer they stay in the open the easyer it is for the Imperials to find them.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-04-04 01:30:59)

Arty frowns looking at the senator, speaking softly but seriously; the whole lightheartedness of her nature suddenly coming to a halt for a serious persona of one that's seen battle "Sir with all due respect, sympathy for the enemy can get you killed if you hesitate even a moment to think that they won't be going home to family. They won't be thinking that we have family to go home to at the end..sometimes making a game of it, as sick and twisted as it may sounds, helps to not think of what we're doing so that one hesitation that would cause us to not come home..doesn't happen." She leans back in her chair and gives an apologetic look to the captin and senator "however all the same forgive us for speaking so light on this."

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-04 06:01:27)

Looking down at the senators mention of ordinary people, Antur always hated this part of war. Its too hard to tell the difference between innocents and the cronies. Antur decides he will do the best he can for the mission, if he gets lucky the body count will be low.
Antur pauses a moment to consider the mission at hand and it phases. "The first two missions sound easy enough, they will get our feet wet. The second mission I believe is probably the most important. If we should come across anything on our mission to aid in the next phase can we keep it? Another question are we up against the empires clones or recruits? Clones are not exactly ordinary people."

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-04-04 06:16:17)

Jordan looked down in the floor for a second at the senators remark. Even though he felt a little ashamed that Arty had gotten him heated up, it didnÂ´t show on the warriors face. Very few people cpuld make him feel ashamed, but Garm Bel Iblis was on of them.
*"Of course senator, we meant no disrespect. But if opened fire upon, I will stop at nothing to protect this crew"*
As Antur spoke, Jordan turned his way, with a slightly annoyed look on his face.
*"I really hope that you mean they have superior fighting skills Antur. For if you meant something else, then I would advice you to say nothing more. I lived with these men, I trained them. And the way the republic used them - no offense senators - made me sick everytime I was reminded of it. I have no desire to kill clones, except for one"*

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-04 07:28:52)

Antur returns Jordan`s gaze with a harsh gaze of his own then snaps "I to have lived with them! I have lived under their rule under their boot, I have endured their punishment. I have no doubt they are being used but I have no love for them." To emphasize his statement Antur pulls up his shirt sleeve revealing a tattooed bar code indicating that Antur had spent at least a fair amount of time in prison. "I will do what I must!"

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-04-04 09:02:07)

*"Sorry to hear about that, but those are the crimes of the Empire, not the clones. What few of the original clones remains under the service of the Empire will soon be bred out, replaced by new recruits and clones from different templates. Palpatine has learned that they can be a nuisance"*
For a moment, Jordan was overwhelmed by images of the final dreaded assault on Kamino.
*"But as I said, I will not hesitate to kill them for the safety of this unit. But I sincerly hopes that none of the original clones comes into my sights"*

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-04 11:07:58)

"Geez, I hope Antur and Jordan are assigned to different ships as this little 'disagreement' could easily fire up again," Zim thought to himself. "Hopefully the Captain notices and deals with the hurt feelings." If not, Zim made a note to talk to each party to make sure the mission would be able to proceed without a hitch.

### **Yogi** (2008-04-04 11:27:47)

Jake arrived and sat before the senators arrived. Seeing some of the others then he nodded and sat. "I hope no one has got a headache from yesterday."  Just then the Senators entered the room and he sat back business like and waited for the mission briefing.
It was pretty straight forward as missions go. A snatch and grab from Imp hands. The mood lightened with the jabs being traded but left quickly when a slight reprimand came from the senator.
A memory came back to him. The day the Imps cornered his father in the docking bay and blew his ship apart. He wondered if the trooper put a hash mark on the repeating blaster he used to mark a kill. *That is a day that I will never forget. They gave my dad no quarter. Would I be able to give it to them?* Jake thought to him self. At this point he didn't know the answer.
He was brought out of his thoughts by the bickering between Antur and Jordan. The last thing they needed was a rift in the squadron. Jake watched the Captain to see what he would do with this.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-04-04 11:30:11)

The senator listens quietly to your responses as if weighing each one on the scales of his ideals.He respondes to each of you in turn.
He looks at Arty and smiles a warm smile.
"I too understand the soldier lifestyle and what it takes to retain your sanity against the horror and bloodshed. I just wanted to make it clear what is being sacrificed by both sides in this fight to restore our beloved Republic.
His gaze shifts to Antur.
"Keep anything and everything you can get your hands on. If you can capture the Lambdas intact keep them too. If not scuttle them and return with the cargo. We will have a medium transport waiting nearby for you to drop the cargo off and make some quick repairs before advancing to the next jump point. The transport is only lightly armored and has no weapons so it will be a micro-jump away for its safety."
To Jordan he replies.
"I know you will do what ever it takes to protect your life and those of your squadron. Im not asking anything less from you. I don't believe you will be facing any clones, since Kamino was shut down and the clone troopers had an accelerated life span. I seriously doubt any have lived this long. The Empire has established hundreds of flight schools and training camps across the galaxy to churn out thier new recruits and pilots."
"Now that the sociological debate of our cause is over anymore tactical questions? I have another briefing soon. Jax has most of the information we have in his mission briefing data."

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **ganthet** (2008-04-04 14:08:17)

"Sir how will we board the shuttles to get the cargo off." "The only ways I can think of is docking the Viodstalker with the ships or Evo." Deel looks around the room and at his squader mates to see if they where thinking the samething. "Both methiods are risky and then we might have to fight the crews once on board."

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-04-04 14:22:09)

Arty nods her head at the mechanics question, how were they suppossed to get the goods out? This mission started to sound more risky than what she had origionaly thought. She listens close for the answer on how they were expected to do this.

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-04-04 19:37:15)

Jordan nods towards Bel Iblis.
*"No sir. I know all too well that Kamino was shut down. I was there. But I know one of them still lives, and since he betrayed them all, I intend to rectify that error when I get the chance"*
He looks back to Antur.
*"If you speak ill of the things the clones have done because they were commanded to, then I will add my voice to yours. But donÂ´t speak ill of the clones themselves, because you have not lived with them as I have"*
Seeing the looks from the rest of the squadron, he adds.
*"But we are both profesional enough to leave discussions like this in the docking bay right?"*
He extends a hand towards Antur.

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-04 21:45:07)

Antur gives Jordan a firm hand shake. "I am good no hard feelings." Smiling Antur is sincere with his reply.
Looking back to Deel Antur states "If we disable the transport then the Voidstalker can dock with her. Once we have the first ship loaded with astro droids we will need to wipe them at least six. Two for the Y-wings and four to pilot the transports back. We will need some good shots ready to board when the time comes." Antur looks around at the squad as if he spoke out of turn and to see if his idea shows favor from the group.

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **ganthet** (2008-04-04 23:19:02)

"That could work." Deel thinks over some stuff. "I will have to see what i can come up with." Nodding to Antur and the Captain. " Should be interesting to see what new equipment we get out of this." Deel pulls out his data pad and calls up the specs on the Voidstalker. Seeing if it could dock to a Lamda class shuttle.
(OCC: Take 10 on a Mechcanic +13)

Meeto was running late to the briefing, he knew he was going to get reprimanded for this but playing holo vid simulations all night amped on Cluster Jolts didn't help him wake up on time. He tries to quietly enter the room, but his footsteps were like blaster shots in the room and all eyes were on him as he entered the room late. He glances an apologetic look of innocence at his captain meeting his glaring stare. Not saying a word Meeto grabs a seat to finish the meeting. Meeto grabs a seat next to Zim in the back and whispers to him.
'What I miss?'

"I'll fill you in on everything later, Meeto, but the short version is we are going space shopping," Zim said with a grin, laughing at the confused expression on the Rodian's green face.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-04-05 12:23:11)

Senator Bel Iblis quietly watches the squad set aside thier differeneces. He give s a nod of approval.
"Sa far as docking with the lambda's I don't know the scematics so I don't know if it is possible or not. You may be able to modify a docking tube or something but that isn't my area of expertise. I have faith that you will complete your assignment. Well I have another meeting so you are dismissed. Jax have your squad ready to leave in twelve hours."
Captain Jax jumps to his feet. He snaps a crisp salute to the senator.
"Yes Sir! Squad atten-shuun."
You all hop up and salute Bel Iblis and he returns it. He then leaves the room with his rodian aid.
Captian Jax turns to the squad.
"At ease. Ok when I dismiss you from here you have one standard hour to get your shit together and grab some chow. We will meet back in the hanger in one hour and begin mission prep. Be on time Meeto! Squad dismissed."

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-05 12:28:47)

Zim quickly fills Meeto in on the mission, as everyone began filing out of the briefing room. Zim goes over his list of equipment in his mind. He already had his equipment packed in his room. "Better bring everything again, and just stow the excess on the Stalker," he thought to himself.
"Feel like grabbing some food, Meeto, or do you need to pack?"

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **ganthet** (2008-04-05 12:58:36)

Deel looks down at his datapad as the captain dismisses them he heads back to his quarters to pack his stuff most of it was still packed or on the Viodstalker so packing won't be to much of a problem.
After that he heads to the mess hall to get some food. Still going thought the specs of the Viodstalker while he is eating. *"Got to be away to do this, can't let everyone down."* He think to himself. After he finishes eating he heads for the hanger.

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-05 14:00:41)

Antur stands after the senator leaves the briefing. At Captain Jax`s order to get it together Antur smiles and salutes the officer. Turning to the squad Antur pats Meeto on the back and laughs "Welcome to the squad, your all ready making the rest of us look better."
"If anyone is grabbing a bite we could go together. We might be able to have a constructed plan to present Captain Jax. At the very least we could fill Meeto on what he missed." Antur motions for the door and looks to see if anyone is interested in his offer.

Arty had saluted as was expected when told to. once the senator had left she turns to the Captin "Sorry..should've known better then to say what I did in front of the senator." She smiles sheepishly, but overhears the talk of getting food together "that sounds like a good idea..you coming with us captin?"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-04-05 15:58:07)

### **Frost** (2008-04-05 22:56:09)

The captian hangs his arm over Arty's shoulder as they walk towards the mess hall.
"I know you didn't mean anything by it."
He then messes up her hair even more if that was possible.
"Lets get some grub Im famished."
He looks over at Meeto and says in rodian.

Art laughs at the hand ruffling her hair makingi t stand at odd angles. She just laughs and shakes her head, letting the hair fall back into place and nudges him with a laugh. "Grub sounds really good." She grins looking up at him "can't wait to go shopping. You never take me anymore." she pokes her tounge out at him, teasing.

### **ganthet** (2008-04-06 01:08:18)

Once in the hanger bay Deel sets to work stowing his equipment and checking things over. He gose over the specs a few times to see if the two ships will link up or not. "XO are you here?" Not hearing anything right away he decsides to find the two Y-wings and start the pre-flight on those frist to get them ready in case someone wants to take them out for a test flight. Picking up his comm link he calls the Captian. "Sir I am going to go over the Y-wings and make sure they are ready, then tackle our other problem next. If Arty is not to busy i could use her help no hurry though I can do the Pre-flights myself."
(OCC: Take ten on a Mechcanics check +13 to see if I can find out if the two transport can dock together. But frist Mechcanics check Take 10 on +13 on the Y-wings to make sure they are ready.)

Meeto salutes his commanding officer
'Yes Sir.' slips from his mouth, not as powerful as a solider should but then again he wasn't really a solider he just liked the toys.
Meeto follows Zim and the others to get some food.
'I could eat. I wish you never challenged us to the holo vid game'
Meeto says sluggishly looking at Antur.
'Its a weakness of mine, I never seem to have the willpower to step away. I have hundreds loaded into the ... eh.. my computer.'
Meeto catches himself almost saying something he didn't want to in front of the Captain. If the captain knew Meeto was using the ships computer resources for games he would kill him. He looks away from Captain Jax and continues.
'Keeps my skills sharp.'
Meeto looks up to the Captain
'You think they will give me a portable computer for the mission, the one I have been working on would be nice. I've finally got the thing to work the way I like it.'

With the mention of getting something to eat Jake smiles. "Yeah some breakfast sounds good. I don't think we're going to get a chance to eat much in the next twelve hours." 
He follows the others and get a laugh at Arty's joke to the Captain. I have a feeling that is just going to be the beginning of our shopping."

The Captain looks at Jordan as they walk throught the hallways towards the mess hall.
"No in order to make our timetable we have to be in Hyperspace in twelve hours.
You arrive at the mess hall and everyone grabs the ships version of food. The Captain grabs a table for the squadron and begins to chow down not seeming to notice how vile the food smells.
In the hanger Deel is poking around the ships doing pre-flight checks when X0 wheels down Voidstalker 1's ramp. He wheels over to Deel and offers his pre-flight data for the Voidstalker 1
"beep doip whoot deet thhhppp."

### **zerah** (2008-04-06 18:35:36)

Arty grabs some food and takes a seat beside the captin, eating quickly so as not to really taste it. She learned from her first time eating it you were better off scarfing and not tasting then anything else.

Jordan grabs himself a meal, and eats it quietly while going through the mission again in his head. Or more specificially, what might go wrong.

"Thank You XO. I am glad I have someone to keep me company this morning." Deel looks over the data that XO had transmitted to his data pad. "I guess everything checks out." "Time to check over Voidstalker 2 and 3." Deel grabs his tools and heads to the Y-wings they will be using. "Care to join me?" When deel reaches the ships he begins preflight on Void 2.
(Occ: Take 10 on mechcanics check +13 for pre-flight on Voidstalker 2.)

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-07 06:22:26)

Sitting at the table Antur grabs a meal and covers it with his arms as he eats. "I was thinking about our first hit. We should try and have ion pistols each and restraining bolts for the droids just in case." Antur takes a drink to wash down his food. Until he is done eating his arms continue to cover his food. "If our intel is correct the first hit should be easy, might not even have escorts. If there are no escorts we should stick to Ion cannons for the fight try to get everything in one peace." Antur`s mood changes slightly before he asks "We should also find out what to do about possible prisoners." As Antur finishes his plate he sits back and relaxes while he drinks his water with the rest of the squad.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-04-07 10:24:06)

"Thats not bad thinking Antur. My initial thoughts were to have VS1 engage the transport and have VS2&3 engage and destroy any escort then help finish off the transport. We won't have very long maybe two minutes at most before they cancalculate an emergency jump. Maybe we should get Deel to work turning on of the spare cabins into a makeshift holding cell."
Captian Jax has finished eating his slop. He sits back and drinks down his cup of caf.
"Any other ideas squad?"
Meanwhile in the hanger bay.
Deel works away looking over they two Y-wings. They are old but still in good shape. You and X0 go over them with a fine tooth comb and find no major defects or flaws.
you hear a watery sounding voice call out
"Is everything ship shape Lt.?"
You look over and see Master Chief Torel the Mon Calamarian crew chief of the hanger bay.
"I had my best techs look them over when Jax brought them in."

"I think we have covered just about everything, Captain." Zim had been unusually quiet during breakfast collecting his thoughts about the upcoming mission. He was uncharacteristically nervous and excited about this mission, as compared to the last one. Sneaking the Senator away was one thing, but attacking a transport which was likely guarded was something different. If they were successful on this one though, the Voidstalkers would become legendary...

"They did a great job Master Chief." Deel looks alittle embased that he take this stuff so seriously. "Everything is ready to go. I am just alittle worried about something going wrong on the mission is all." Deel looks at the Master Chief. "I was wondering, do you think that Voidstalker 1 would dock with a Lambda class shuttle in space to transfer cargo and people?"

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-04-07 11:14:22)

The Master chief thinks it over for a minute.
"Well I don't think you would be able to transport cargo but I'm sure you could hook up to the air lock easily enough. That would let you get onboards. The cargo would have to be moved using the tractor beam or EVA. The ship would manuever like a hutt's tail docked like that so I wouldn't recomend it if the situation was still hot."
In the mess hall.
"Ok people when your done get your kit and meet up in the hanger bay. I wanna run some drills before we head out get everyone used to their position and ships."
The Captain heads out of the mess hall.

"Well hopefully we won't have to worry about that if everything goes as planned. Thank you Master Chief and tell your men they did a great job on the Y-wings for me." Deel pulls out his comlink and and calls the Captain Jax. "Sir the ships all check out. Tell Anthur and the others that they have some new toys to play with."

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-04-07 11:27:31)

Deel's comlink chirps
"Copy that Deel. Im sending Arty over to you I want you guys to get to work turning one of the cabins into a temporary holding cell. Strip it out secure any exits and reprogram the entry panel so it only works from the outside. Jax out."

Art stands and puts her plate away for cleaning before mock saluting to the group and poking her tounge out at the captin before laughing and running off to the hanger.
Once there she looks around "Deel! hey Deel! where are you?"

### **Yogi** (2008-04-07 12:38:50)

The conversation at the table over the barely passable food was productive. Some good points were brought up. Better now than in the midst of an engagement. As he finished off the last of the food they were ready to leave. The Captain told them to grab their kits ad report to the hanger. "Roger Captain. See you there in a few." 
Jake got to his cabin quickly and grabbed his kit. Fortunately he had spent most of his life on the go and had learned how to travel fairly light and be ready to go on a moments notice. Making sure the last of the little things were packed away he took a look around to make sure that nothing was left behind. Satisfied he hefted his kit and walked to the hanger and stowed the bag on VS1.
He saw Deel as he came down the ramp on his way to VS3. "Deel how do the Y-wings stack up?"  He hopped into the cockpit and began to go over the controls.

Antur finishes his drink before standing. "We should meet to plan every stage of the mission, just so we are all on the same page." Antur salutes his squad and head for his quarters aboard the Void Stalker. After Antur is sure all his belongings are safely on board Antur heads over to his Y-wing to check it out.
Inside the hanger bay Antur waves to Deel as he walks in " Hey Deel."

### **ganthet** (2008-04-07 14:22:56)

Still standing by the Y-wings Deel motions to Arty. "Over here, Arty." Specking into his com link "Roger that Sir will get to work on it right away. Deel out." Hw weaves at Anthr."The ships are ready to go." He shouts over the nosies of the hanger bay.
Truning his attention to Jake. "They both check out. The Master Chief's crew have gone over them and XO and I have gone over them they are ready to go." Deel looks back down at his data pad. "I can tell that you want to take one out so when the captain gets here, maybe he will let you take it for a spin." "Captain has some more work for me so I will leave you with your new toy." Deel walks back to VS1 he doesn't complatly understand what these guys like flying so much. Deel is a good pilot he would rather just fix things or come up with crazy ways of getting stuff done.

Arty waves then stops and rolls her eyes "one sec!" and runs to her room of sorts to grab her bag, she never unpacked, always on the ready. Running back to the ship she stows her gear and heads back out to greet Deel again "Sorry about that, almost forgot my gear!" she laughs and looks around "how they look?"

Zim excuses himself to his room, grabbing his large supply of items into three different packs. Already he had accumulated a large amount of gear. Like last mission, he chose to take everything to the ship, and then decide exactly what he would have on him at any moment.

### **ganthet** (2008-04-07 16:31:10)

Deel walks into the Voidstalker and trys to figure out which room will work as a holding cell. *"Needs to be kind of spaceous and have a little comforts to it."* Thinking to himself. He finally picks one of the livespaces on the ship mostly because they have nothing in them that people can use to escape with. "Well the guys aren't going to like this but I can sleep in the engine room if I have to." With that he starts to work on striping out the room.
(Occ: Mechcanics check +13. taking to 10 to make sure it is done right.)
(Going to pick one of the rooms on the ship that we would stay in when we are on ship. Sorry guys just going to have to find a someplace else to sleep.)

"Deel make sure the cell is escape prof, don`t want anyone trying to capture our ship." Looking over to Arty "I volunteer my room, if I had another place to bunk that is." Antur gives Arty a sly wink.

"And as far as escape proof, we will have to find someone to test it out for us." Deel hopes he has saved Arty but only time will tell.

Arty raises a brow while a slow grin moves across her face, she chuckles softly "I don't mind a bit of company Deel.." she walks over to Antur, looking him over before leaning up to his ear to whisper "If you don't mind the floor." She turns and walks off laughing, going to find her ion and get comfortable.

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-07 17:41:28)

Fortunately, Jordan had left his things back at the Voidstalker, and once he had eaten, he could return there right away. He mused a little over the arguments as to who would sleep where, but knew that he could easily settle it.
*"IÂ´ll just make camp out in the main area. DoesnÂ´t really matter if it is necessary or not, I like to have a distinct difference between being in the field and on base"*
He proceeds to move his gear (basically just some weapons and explosives), into the main hold, where he quickly turns a couch into a makeshift resting place.

The Rodian knew he didn't get off to a good start of the day, missing the debriefing meeting and now it looks like the Captain didn't want to even talk to him, but Meeto was persistent. Meeto let the soldiers figure out the details of prisoners and attack, he was better behind a terminal giving support.

Deel still working on the make shift holding cell. He hit the ships comm system. "Hey Arty make sure those to hot shots don't scratch the paint on those new rides, I would hate to have to bill them for the repairs." Deel smiles as he listens to all his friends talk they have become comfrotable around each other. Hand still on the botton. "Hey Meeto if your not busy could you give me a hand with this?" Deel releases the botton and moves back to what he is working on.

The Captain finally arives in the hanger bay to check on the progress. He shouts across the hanger.
"Voidstalkers form up on me."
Once you all gather around
"Ok Lt Golan, Lt. Cage suit up your taking your Y-wings out for a test run. These are longprobe versions. That means no gunner and no astromech so you'll be flying solo so get used to firing your own ion cannons and torpedoes. I had a couple of empty cargo crate fitteed with trancievers dropped for you to target practice on. Be back in two hours. Deel and Arty I need the cage done in three hours. Meeto I talked to supply about your computer and they said someone from this squadron all ready has one issued. So who ever has it fork it over.
Once the cage is done I'm gonna take VS1 out and we can try some group manuevers. Any questions?"

"Woot!" Antur shouts. Smiling Antur runs for the Void stalker to change into his flight gear. While running Antur looks back to the captain "Only a couple I will be back in a sec." Giving a running salute to Jake Antur boasts "Lets see how good your trigger finger is, 50 credits on who gets the most .... crates?"

"No Sir." After being dissmissed Deel heads back to his work on the ship. "Hey Meeto. That computer you are looking for is in the engine room if you want it. Kind have my hands full with all the stuff Anthr, Jake and Jordan break on missions." Deel leads Meeto to the engine room to get the computer. Then he heads back to the holding cell to finish his work. "Well I guess the Capt. wants this done in 3 hours so lets give the man what he wants."

Arty laughs as she watches Antur running to change "Keep betting like that and you'll lose all your money!" she yells after him before turning back to the Captin with a grin "Three hours to get the cell done, shouldn't be too hard Captin with Deel and I working together." She waves to the Captin and turns to the Voidstalker grabbing her trusty tool kit that she'll keep in her room and heading to the new holding cell to get to work.

X0 rolls along with Deel and Arty whistling merrily to himself as he helps out by soddering connections and welding bars over ventilation and access points in the new cell.
The Captain is in the cockpit going over flight data and setting up navigation data. He also works with Zim helping him learn the flight controls and firing sequences of the Voidstalker.
Cage and Golan have been cleared to leave the hanger.

Jake follows Antur as he heads for Void Stalker 1. "Your on Antur since my trigger finger is a bit itchy."
Jake quickly suits up in his flight suit and then grabs his helmet and heads for his Y-wing and climbs in the cockpit. Running through the checklist he powers up the engines. Seeing all is ready he clicks the comms. "Void Stalker 3 two lit and green. Ready to go."

Inside his Y-wing Antur runs through the check list. All lights green Anturs comm mimics Jakes " Void Stalker two lit and good to go." When the hangers lights go green signaling a clear exit Antur hits the throttle and bursts into space. A quick scan and Antur loops towards the empty containers. "Void three this is Void two, how is the dust back there over?"

"Well I don't know how escape proof we can make this room here. But at least we can make sure they don't have anything on them that maight help them out when we put them in." Deel works on the door controls. He expertly checks every conection to make sure that power is only going where he wants it to. "Hopefully we won't need to hold them long in here any way."
"You know maybe I should set up the ships comms so we can hear how Antur and Jake are doing with there practice runs." Deel moves over to the ships comms near where they where and trys to tap into the Viod 2 and 3's comm chatter.

They say time flies when your having fun. Time really flies when your blowing stuff up from the cock pit of starfighters with fifty creds on the line. In the end the winners is Antur by one crate. The squad cheers as they listen or watch from the VS1. The cell is done and ready for prisoners. Captain Jax orders the VS1 out of the bay and has 2&3 fall into formation. He takes them through several manuevers and formations. He has Zim put the ship through its paces. He calls out targets for the gunners and the Y-wings. Overall its a good time like the calm before a storm. He has the ships dock and refueled.
In the docking bay.
"Ok that was good practice run squad. This should be a blue-milk run but watch yourselves out there. Our main objective is the transports so try to run the escort off and focus on the Llambda. Meet back here in two hours and be prepped and ready for launch. X0 has the jump calculations done and loaded in the squadrons nav comps ensuring we all arrive at the same time. Dismissed!"

### **zerah** (2008-04-08 14:58:25)

Arty hums, trying to think what to do in the meantime before the launch. She shrugs and hums a random song on her way back on board the voidstalker, and to the room she'd claimed, making it more appealing for sleep and clearing any clutter so it was more neat looking. She makes both beds and then smiles at the finished job. Bored, she wanders around the ship, looking for anything she might need to know, memorizing the layout.

Taking on the persona of a little girl, the woman actually pouts at not being told what he was hiding. She recovers from it quickly enough to punch him in the arm, a friendly thing, "psh, you know nothings gonna happen! nothin stops you Jax, you know that." She only ever called him by his name when she was being serious about something, and true, she was serious..nothing stopped him. "And I like this group, the guys are pretty funny, and Antur...boy that's an interesting one...I can hide in your room still if I need to right?"
She gives him her best ewok look as cute as she could, he never could resit that and hiding in his room had been something she had done many times with the old group, when needing to get away from the guys..or if they looked at her wrong..then again it was entertaining to watch the Captin go after that one guy with his blaster...

Arty grins at him, wraping her arms around him in a hug while laying her head on his shoulder, alone she got to show him some affection; he was family to her, and the only one she had since her parents had flown off somewhere, she lost contact with them and he was there to help her along. "You know even a direct order wouldn't keep me out." she laughs, then nods her head "Deel great! I think he spends too much time with machines but in this case that may not be a bad thing..all in all..I think we have a really nice group here." She leans back to grin widely "one big happy sappy family again."

Meeto makes it to engineering and hears Arty talking to XO when he makes his way inside to find the portable computer.
'Hey Arty, nice shooting out there.' Meeto smiles as he sees Arty taking good care of XO
Meeto moves around engineering looking for something
'He really likes that, I think you hit his sweet spot. Have you seen the portable computer around?'
Right when he asks Arty where the computer was, he finds it and turns on the computer.
'Never mind , found it.
The screen on the the computer comes to digital life, he inserts a special diagnostics data card that he specially programed and starts typing very fast. He takes some auxiliary inputs and inserts them into XO.
'Okay, lets see how your doing little guy. Anything bothering you?'
Meeto does a full and through diagnostic while Arty is cleaning him up. Meeto's fingers type so fast that it sounds like someone is mashing the keys in some rhythmic chaotic pattern. Meeto turns to Arty while running the tests. When its just Arty and Meeto he asks,
'How do you like our new members? Seems your warming up to them nicely.'

Meeto diagnostic reveals some surprising things about X0. Several of his memory sections have been secured and partitioned from his normal memory. It also seems he hasn't been memory wiped in over six years. One final thing you notice is that his basic droid programming has either been modified or corrupted because he has no normal droid restrictions about harming sentient beings.

He had not flown during his first mission, but he was more than a little pleased to show everyone that he knew his way around the pilot's station.

'That's strange, Hmmm...'
Meeto looks up at Arty, his Rodian tentacle ears spread open with intrigue.
'I wonder where the captain found XO... Everything seems to be working okay, in fact, better than okay. This droid has seen a lot of action, and he's got some special modifications. Somebody really talented must have did some re-programing. One interesting thing is he hasn't had a memory wipe in long time, and there seems to be some corrupted programming. His sentient harm functions are turned off.'
Meeto laughs
'Don't piss of XO! He's armed with an electro shock probe.'
Meeto looks over the diagnostics's closely noticing the secured sectors, but he keeps that knowledge to himself.
'So XO, how do you feel? If you ever need me to work on you just let me know, I would be happy to help you with your programing.'

The ships leave the hanger bay of Tantive IV. The Y-wings move up to the docking clamps of the CItadel cruiser and get locked in. Capt. Jax orders the ship to move away from the tantive then make the jump to hyper-space. Forty eight hours later you emerge back into realspace at the designated coordinates. You recieve a hail from your medium transport that is hiding a short jump away letting you know it is in position. It seems like you have been waiting forever for the convoy to show. Meeto finally recieves a ping from his sensors after a quick scan it shows that a Llambda class shuttle and two V-wing starfighters have just dropped out of Hyper-space.
"This is it people to your battle stations. Deel get those shields raised. Meeto get our ion cannon a sensor lock. Cage and Golan get to your ships and prepare to disengage docking clamps. Revv, Pyuuma get to those turrets lets go!. Zim start our approach!."
*The llambda is 25 squares away. It will take a couple of rounds to get into firing range. The VS1 has a speed of 3 sq/rnd VS2&3 have speeds of 4. You can do an all out move in a vehicle and move x4 vehicle speed but cannot attack and are considered flat footed against attacks.*

"Beginning approach now, Captain," Zim tells Captain Jax. He definitely felt a pang of nervousness as the mission they had been preparing for was now underway. "Stay calm, Zim, remember your breathing..." he told himself. He thought back to the recent meditation he had began, and attempted to center himself and control his emotions, as he directed the VS1 forward.

Opening his secure comm to the squad Antur says " Only two V-wings and a Lambda this will be easy. We should stick to Ions and try to capture the lot of them." Antur finishes the check list and awaits furthers orders.
"Jake we should gang one with ions take it out quickly then the second. While we do that Void one can work of the Lambdas shields. We wont be long with the V-wings and we will be in on the Lambda too." Antur smiles and lets out a Woot! "This is Void two reporting good to go on your mark one."

Jake marked one of the V-wings with his targeting computer and sent the info to Antur. "Bogey one is marked lets take him first. I'll follow you in and cover you.

Antur disengages from the docking clamp off Void Stalker one, releasing his Y-wing into the battle field. "Void two is clear of Void one engaging the enemy now. This won`t take long over." Powering up his ion cannon Antur readies a lock on the lead V-wing. Hitting the throttle to full Antur moves into position while lining up his shot. Under his breath Antur whispers "Its go time" then fires a spread of ion bolts at the lead V-wing.

"I'm on it Captin!" Arty says into the headset before taking it off and quickly rushing out of the ion cannon area, then runs the rest of the way to engineering. And skidding to stop, passing the door in her hast and rushing back in "I'm here, have no fear! lets get this hunk of junk back on track." She grabs up the tools and starts getting to work.

The Y-wings swoop towards the wounded transport like bloodhawks after easy prey. Thier ion cannons make short work of the shuttle. It powers down and starts drifting.
The Captain yells for Revv to get down here and get ready for the boarding party. Over the comm he says.
"Antur get over here and dock. I need you on the boarding party. Golan you provide security encase one of those v-wings gets itself working again. Zim move use up to the transport and lock on with the tractor beam."
In engineering X0 wheels in and starts helping with the repairs.

Meeto begins diagnostics from the ships computer, the flickering power makes it obvious that Void Stalker Citadel took heavy damage.
'This isn't good, we took heavy damage and its going to take several hours to repair half the damage.'
Meeto gets out of the systems operator chair and packs the portable computer slinging his pack with all his gear over his shoulder.
'You will need me to break security codes to commender the ship.' He says to the Captain while getting ready
Pulling out his blaster pistol in a soldier fashion readying the firearm, checking the power cell and making sure the safety is off. He looks up to the Captain, expecting him to let him go, but he respects the Captain enough to wait for his orders.

"I am going to take alooks at the shield generator, get that up and going. Pick a task and start in there is plenty to go around." Deel kind of seems depressed because of the amount of work to be done and the little time there is to do it. His leeku are showing his distress as the move.

Jake continues to fly around the engagement site keeping a look out with the Y-wing advanced sensors. "I'll keep doing sweeps of the area and my eyes open for any unwelcome visitors." As he passed the disabled V-wings he hit them again with a burst from the ion cannons to keep them powered down. *It wouldn't do to have them power up again and cause trouble."*  He thought.
"If you guys need help let me know and as far as repairs for Void one I can also lend a hand." He continued to fly around half wishing he could join in the boarding party.

The ships lock up and the VS1's airlock cycles open creating a portal to the Lambda. The lamda's power seems to be flickering in and out but for now the airlock seems to be stable.

Your Y-wings don't have astromech port (The were removed to add extra sensors and a nav computer) so your priority is low.

Jax takes a bite of his gruel and washes it down with some blue milk.
"Our next run should be similiar to the first one, this time we are hitting a weapons supply run. We should expect more resistance on the boarding party this time since it is weapons and maybe a heavier escort posibly arc fighters or maybe even a skipray blastboat."

Antur finishes his meal and looks around the table."A skip would be great, but I would be happy not to see one put against us. Arc`s are tough if we face them we should open with trops focus on them and take them out." Sitting back in his chair Antur relaxes " We could send in the shuttle make it look, er well it is damaged. If they took they bait we could have a strike team on the shuttle take over and have another ship in the fight. The whole time Void 1 2 and 3 stays just in jump range ready to swoop in and save the day. I think it could be done we might need a few more bodies though and thats where we use the droids to help pilot."

Jordan picks up some of the clips for his slug rifle and starts to bind them together in pairs with mesh tape.
*"You are right captain, but V-Wings are fast. IÂ´m no naval expert, but it seems to me like having a swift interceptor around is never a bad idea. We could rebuild them to get some more useful weaponry and maybe some heavier plating, but I donÂ´t think we should discard them right away. Unless they are needed somewhere else of course"*
He listens to AnturÂ´s plan with interest.
*"Sounds like a good plan to me, but what if they donÂ´t buy it? Or maybe they wonÂ´t take any chaches with a shuttle lost in combat with the rebellion. I know we have some ace pilots here, but I wouldnÂ´t want to try and pilot a damaged Lambda shuttle through a firezone of imperial fighters"*

Meeto looks a bit tired working on the droids all night, but he wasn't late to breakfast and while voidstalkers crew discusses what's going on he finds time to get spoon fulls of food in between his comments.
'With your permission Captain, I'd like to gun the Laser Turret this time around, being that we are going after a weapons supply runner and we will need more fire power. I will concentrate my fire on the escort fighters. If we can get another Ion Cannon on the VS 1 then I would be happy to use it, but its all we got. We need a Jamming suite or array to help guarantee our attacks go unnoticed jamming there signal when we ambush them is something we should think about. If we can one of those, then I could stay on sensors.'
Meeto waits for the Captain's response.

"Not a problem Sir." Deel hopes that he will beable to live up to the Captain's expectations for him. Things have gone ok so far, but that doesn't mean they can't go wrong in a hurry. "Besides it gets lonely in the engine room. I will finally get to see you guys in action." Finishing his meal and his juice.

Arty couldn't help herself, she stuck her tounge out at the Captin and chuckled "The same thing everyone else has said. Jam their frequency, take out the escort fast so we can focus on the transport." She shrugs and pushes the plate a little from her as she leans back in her chair.

He dismisses you all and everyone has about thirty minutes to be loaded and ready to go. Deel checks over the ships and they are refueled and ready to go. With that the ships dock up and Zim hits the button and the voidstalkers are back in hyperspace. Its going to be a three day trip to get to the ambush site.

Arty sneaks around the ship, bored and in need of something to do she was doing her favorite pasttime: sneaking up on the Captin. She grins while laughing inside her head as she readys herself to pounce on him. Yes...pounce; she learned how from a group of Farghul kittens she and the captin met once, ever since he's cursed ever meeting. She quietly sneaks up behind him, readys...and then pounces him.

Zim certainly agreed with the Captain about keeping the ship out of harm's way for the beginning of the fight. A couple of hits from those cannons and the VS1 would be in real trouble. If VS 2 and 3 could soften up the main ship, VS1 could roll in and clean up things. During the three day ship, Zim re-enacted the first battle in his head. He decided to hold off on the upcoming attack runs, for at least the early part of the battle.

Meeto perks up at Anturs request and he seems to be really excited speaking very fast
*lots of weird rodian sounds in rapid succession* [hide]'First we are going to need some parts, maybe we have some still left over from our last mission ... about....'[/hide]
Meeto realizes that he did it again, he always seems to default to his native tongue when excited or under extreme stress
'Sorry Antur. I can do the modification, but I will need Deel and Arty's help to make sure its done right. Its takes about a days work, we can do it on our way to the nav point. Only thing is we need parts, and I'm not sure we have the spare parts available on VS1. Depending on the modification your interested in doing we can enhance the shields or speed, and if we had some time I could improve the accuracy of you weapons, or damage if we had a power generator to spare. I could even tweak with the selective fire of your weapon, but I have to take a look at it first. Only one modification can be done to weapons, and only one to your shields or speed. If we do have the parts I would have time to do one of the two. I bet those V-wing may have had the parts to do the job.'
((OOC: Meeto has Tech Specialist, so as long as we have the time and credits he will do Modifications. Only thing is he has to make the Mech check, so I would want Deel and Arty to Aid him. If Arty and Deel aid him then he will only need a 6 on 1d20, plus we need the parts or 1/10 the cost of the vehicle or 1,000 credits which ever is more. Not sure if its base cost 50,000 or after market cost 185,000. So either 5,000 in credits or 18,500 credits to do the modification. I would assume the base cost of the ship, but I could be wrong.))

Meeto swings out of his seat and leaves the sensor chair that he has made his home on VS1, almost forgetting to turn off the portable computer he had next to the chair. He quickly punches in some commands and saves whatever he was doing on the computer then powers it down and packs it taking it with him. Ever since he got the thing he has not let anyone use it for anything. He looks excited and and ready to work.

After finishing the checks he heads to his room to finish the idea he wants to build. Thinking to himself.*"I wonder if I will be able to find the parts I need to make this work."* He walks down the hall from the engine room to his quarters and sees Capt. Jax and Arty.

Zim was not present for the repairs or the horseplay. He had been keeping more to himself lately, not out of any displeasure with his team, but more of excitement at the progress he was making in what he supposed was the Force. He had spent most of his "off duty" time in his room recently, working on his breathing exercises and his mediatation. He noticed when he opened his eyes from a recent meditation, that the ion pistol he had laid on a nearby table was actually floating off the bed. Since that time, he has constantly been replicating that feat, but he had not mentioned it to any of his crew.

Deel missed his family but there wasn't time to go home and see them. As he laughes seeing the mock battle he leans against the bulkhead and slids down to the floor.

Sensor sweeps come up clean nothing out thier but stellar dust.
"Hold off on shields till we have a contact, no point burning extra energy we might need later."
A few hours pass and boredom is numbing your brains when VS2&3 senor boards light up. Four contacts show up. Detailed scans reveal another Lambda and looks like three escorts. Two ARC-170s and a Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor. They are on a bearing moving towards your position. If they haven't spotted you they will soon.
*Everyone has a surprise round. The Lambda and escorts are 30 squares away. You can do an all out move in vehicles and move x4 your speed.*

Jake angles towards Antur and forms up. Flicking the master arm switched he activates all weapon systems and brings up his shields. "Void 2 I'm considering torps on the Arc's. We need to take them out quickly."
OOC: Jake does an all out move to keep up with Antur. All out move is x4 right. Antur do you want to move 12 or 16 squares. If we move 16 it will put us in medium range for torps. Right now their flat footed so we would have a better chance of hitting. Holding action on firing till Antur responds to OCC question.

Jake listens over the squadron frequency as the Lambda hails and asks for terms of surrender. Jake continues on his course and takes up position up and away from the shuttle out of the firing arc of the ships powerful blaster cannons.
"VS3 on site and covering the package Captain. Beginning sensor sweep of the area to watch for incoming ships."
Jake began the sweep as he kept the Ion cannons primed in case they tried to make a run for it.

Arty nods her head as the captins voice comes over her headset "Roger that Captin, I'll make sure they can't run." She positions her sights on the Lambda and keeps her fingers at the ready to fire should it try to run.

Antur slows to a stop and begins sensor sweeps, while still maintaining a lock on the ETA-2. "Watch yourselves in there Jake and I have your backs from here."

Zim flips the com on and replies, "This is the Void Stalker 1, shuttle Kilo. We have received your message. We are prepared to accept your surrender. Drop any shields and prepare for boarding."

### **Frost** (2008-05-18 02:21:46)

"Shuttle Kilo acknowledges."
The two shuttles dock easily enough and there is no resistance onboard. This ship doesn't seem to have any stormtroopers onboard this time. It takes a few minutes to verify the cargo of weapons. There is about forty tons of weapons and parts.
Jax tells his boarding team to secure the pilots in the brig and to get Deel or Arty over here to get thise box flyable.

Arty nods her head again at the order and takes off her headset, powering down her cannon and moving out into the hall, waving to the captured ones with a grin before moving to the other ship and setting to work "I'm here Captin! lets see what the damage is like."
*Take 10 on mechanics*

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-05-18 23:11:22)

The damage seems fairly minor since it was mostly ion damage. It will take about an hour to re-initialize the systems.

"How's it going? Can we save her?"
Jax says jokingly.

### **zerah** (2008-05-18 23:31:33)

Arty looks up, wiping her brow with her hand, which just spreads oil onto her forehead. She grins "I think so, she seems like a tough broad." she laughs as she turns back to the work "the pilots give you any trouble? what'd you do with the bodies of the stromtroopers?"

### **Frost** (2008-05-18 23:34:31)

"The pilots seemed eager to give up and no stormfodder this time around. Hand me that wrench I will give you a hand."
Jax grabs his comlink and tells Zim to tractor in the ETA-2 and latch it to the citadel.
"Ok lets get to work."

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-05-19 00:07:00)

### **ganthet** (2008-05-19 00:36:42)

Setting in the copit of the Lambda transport, Deel gose over the ships systems. He let Arty take the engine room this time. *" Let's now, the Ions guns havn't done that much damage it seems. Should be able to get it flying in no time."* He thinks to himself. Picking up his commlink he calls the Jax. "Captian who's going to be flying this brid back?" " If you would let me maybe with the help of Arty, I could fly it back." Deel isn't much of a combat pilot, but flying a shuttle shouldn't be that hard. Hopefully there won't be anyone shooting at them anyway.

Pointing his blaster pistol like he means business the Rodian plays the role of constable disarming the surrendering Lambda crew members of their weapons, personal items, and any communication devices they may have on their person. They are searched and shackled with binders and escorted to VS1's make shift brig that looks fairly secure, albeit crude.
'The crew is in the brig Captain.' Meeto says into his comlink ' Meeto moves outside closing the door so the prisoners can not hear him anymore. 'I'd like to look at the ships computers, and systems to see if I can find anything interesting.'
Meeto starts to move to the Lambda class starship, grabbing the portable computer he moves to the bridge of the Imperial ship and jacks in trying to access information.
((OOC: Slicing into the systems, recent transmissions, personal files, astrogation points, manifesto's, and more importantly the ship crew manifest to make sure all crew members are accounted. Meeto looks for anything out of the ordinary as well. Computers +15 he will take a 10))

Antur fly`s a few circles running active scans throughout the area "Hey captain what should we do about the ETA-2? I sure its pilot is getting bored by now." Antur swings in close to see what the ETA-2 pilot is doing, Antur even manages a thumbs up to the pilot trying to let him or her know its going to be ok. Antur keeps a lock on the ETA-2 and his ion cannon charged while he moves the Y-wing in as close as he can to the little ship.

Once the prisoners are secured, Jordan proceeds to investigate the shuttles cargo. As it was supposed to contain weaponry, he decides to see what he can find. If nothing else, an inventory of the things can always be good to have.
((Rummage around the weaponry and other cargo of the shuttle and make an inventory. Is there also something we might take??))

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-05-19 10:39:13)

The ships computer reveals nothing out of the ordinary. It seems these weapons were being shipped to an Imperial garrison on the planet Baltimeer. Everyone on board is accounted for and locked up. The ETA-2 is secured to the Voidstalker 1 and it's pilot is also secured. The crew works hard and fast to get everything ready to go and the cargo transported. An hour or so later X0 transmits the jump coordinates and you meet up with the transport ship. You unload your goods and prisoners. Jax informs you that we have new orders and that we are to meet up with Bail Organa on the Tantive IV. A few days later you are home onboard the Tantive. You have all had a good nights rest and a decent meal. You make your way to the meeting room and wait for Bail.

Deel looks around and takes a seat looking over his data making sure he didn't miss anything on the repairs for the ships. " I guess I will finish going over these reports on the proformace of the ships systems."

"Thank you sir." Deel looks up at Jax and smiles. "I have been trying my best. I have also been learning alot." Deel looks back down at his datapad. "I imagine that Antur and Jordan will want me to figure out away to make the Y-wing perfrom better. I have also been looking at ways to improve VS1 as well." "I hope to try to make the improvements when we get some free time. What do you think sir." Deel hopes that Jax will let him do the work.

Arty stretches as she enters the room, heading straight to the captin and stealing his cigar as she takes a seat beside him, propping her feet up on the table as well, laizily drapping one over his "Don't you know smoking's bad for you." She grins as she takes a puff on it and blows it out, attempting to make a smoke ring.

"You ready for a real shopping trip? You and Deel should get together with Meeto and make a list of things you might wanna get from Nar Shadaa. You still have contacts there?"

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-05-20 02:13:03)

Arty pokes her tounge out at him when he stole the cigar back only to perk up and do a little dance in her seat at the prospect of shopping "shopping! awesome!" She grins and leans against, mentaly making a note of the things she wanted to get. At his question she nods her head "mmhmm, I think they should still remember me, gives me some time to check on my accounts too." She hums in thought and tilts her head up to look at him upside down "you need anything special?"

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-05-20 02:15:13)

"I leave that kinda stuff up to you techies but anything to make the ship go faster fight harder or last longer is fine with me. Maybe new shields or a hyperdrive upgrade."
He takes a puff and blows a ring.

Meeto walks into the meeting room he has the portable computer and is balancing a drink on top like waiter, you always see Meeto with the computer and he seems to enjoy using the electronic device. Since the others don't really care he doesn't mind "holding" on to it. His eyes are fixed on the screen as he is holding the thing in one hand and using the other to typing on the keypad, he still finds time between typing with one hand to grab the drink and take a sip then returning it on top the area he isn't using to type. He somehow finds a seat and doesn't fall over anything or spill his drink, He still is able to squeak out a greeting.
'Hey everyone...' He says quickly never looking at anyone
He sits down laying the device on his lap, and put the drink near his side then begins to use both hands again, taping on the keys fast and with purpose, his attention is on whatever he is doing on the portable computer.

Antur strolls in a little late but in all the same. "Hey squad." He says with a smile. "How does it feel to be a part of one of the best squads in the galaxy?" Antur chuckles at his last statement very pleased with the crew he has been assigned to.

### **Frost** (2008-05-20 12:07:32)

Zim walks in with a cup of caf in his hand and a very tired look on his face. He doesn't say anything just kinda seems to mumble his greetings. He is running on autopilot this morning it seems. Jax just looks at him and chuckles.
Jake enters soon after and slides into an empty seat.
A few moments later Bail Organa arrives and takes a seat at the head of the table.
"I just wanted to let you know that the Alliance is extremly grateful to you for your service as of late. I know you have been going non stop the last couple weeks and we appreciate it. We are waiting for some new coordinates to be delivered so it looks like you have some free-time. I want you to take a couple weeks off and rest up. I have credit chips for you all to take a little R&R courtesy of Alderaan. Five thousand credits each should help you relax and get ready for your next struggle I think. He lays out seven cred chips on the table."
Jax gets up and hands a credit chip to each of you.
"I'm sure we will make do Sir."
Bail smiles
"Well if there isn't anything else I should get back to my meetings."
He pauses giving you a chance to ask him anything or speak in general.

Deel takes his eyes off his datapad as Senator Organa walks in. He nods as the he thanks them for there efforts on trying to restore freedom back to the galaxy. As the credchips are handed out Deel kind of stares at his. 5000 creds is alot of money to him. His parents where lucky if they had enuff to pay for the fuel and parts they needed to repair the ships that came to the station for repairs. When the Senator leaves Deel continues to look at his credchip. "This is more money then i have seen at one time. My parents ran a repair station on Tatoonie and it kept us going." When Deel finishes showing how big of a farm boy he is he switches gears. "Well I guess I know what I will be doing on my down time. Making the ships go faster and blow stuff up better." Deel smiles as if he is looking forward to it.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-05-20 13:58:14)

Jordan listens quietly to what the senator says, glad for some time without action. He is used to always being on the move, but even so, he can still appreciate some time off. Of course, he has already planned what to do with his time. He picks up one of the cred chips, and approaches Organa.
"Thank you for this senator, IÂ´m sure these will come in handy. However, I would like to ask you for another favor. Transport to a system far out on the Rim. It is an isolated world, where few travels...few even knows where it is. I doubt I could find any public transportation to get there"

Arty takes the chip and tucks it into her top pocket "5 grand, I can put that to good use." She looks over to the mechanic and the computer geek, as he was fondly becoming to her "We need to take a look around for shield and hyderdrive upgrades, new weapons would be nice and I'm sure the two boys over there would appreceate a faster ride." She grins at Antur and Jordan and leans back "And I dunno about you guys I am in need of seeing someone other than men all day, not that I don't adore the lot of you.." she grins wickedly and looks up at the captin "Girl talk always did make you uneasy, even after all this time of having to put up with it." she laughs and stretchs again "Gonna head to our favorite cantina, see if Arestel is still working there...you remember her right Captin? the one that had the hots for you?"

He glances ar Arty and rolls his eyes.
"You think every girl has the hots for me. You just like to play match maker."

"So kids you ready to go? Where did you wanna go Revv?"

Antur lets out a whistle as he pockets the credits. "I love this job." Antur looks over to Jax "I think it was Jordan who wanted to take a trip, though I am good to go to. Anything to pilot soem more." Antur laughs as Arty hides behind him, putting his feet up Antur smiles as Arty uses him for protection.

She idly picks at his outfit "I'm taking you shopping after though. I swear you have three outfits and they all look the same, minusing of course that horribly outdated outfit you call a formal uniform." She grins wickedly at him, she knew how much he hated shopping "and if you say no then i'll just go shopping without you..." To anyone else that threat may not mean much, but to those that knew her, knew that to let her shop for things without them ment her getting revenge for anything she could think of, which included outfits of itchy material, hated colors, and too tight clothing.

"Frac that hurt." Deel jumps the discharge from one of the systems he was checking hit him. "You could have warned me you know." Deel says to XO. Deel then hears the sound of someone coming down the hall. "Arty, Captian is that you? I am in the engine room." He calls out.

Deel sees Arty stick her head thought the door. "Ya having a great time figureing out new ways to try to kill myself. i was just checking over the systems plenty to do if you want to help." Deel goes back to his work still kind of nurseing his hand some. " No sir I would never dream of hurting XO. He has been a great help to me and he is valued member of the team. Besides I think Arty would shot me if I hurt him." Deel says with his back to Jax and Arty. "I will check him over just to make sure he is ok though."

"It is fine just hurts." Deel says looking at some read outs and checking to make sure everything is secure. "As far as Mods I was thinking maybe Combat type manuvering jets to get the ship to responed better. Maybe faster sublight engines for more speed, Better hyperdrive 1.5 or better if we can get it. Shields, maybe armor ,Nav computer I could go on and on but it is all in what we can get and how much time we have for the work." Deel looks around at Arty and the Jax.

"You would be surprized how many ships going in and out of Tatonnie have parts stole from them then sold to repair stations and put back on the same ship.

### **Frost** (2008-06-25 10:30:07)

You return to the Tantive IV. The air seems charged and excitment runshigh among the crew.
Your called into a mission briefing the minute you land almost. Bail Organa is sitting in the briefing room waiting for you.
"Hope you had a pleasant vacation but it is time to get back to work. Our source in Imperial Intelligence has leaked to us that the new Star Destroyer plans are being shipped to Kuat Drive Yards. They are sending them as part of a routine cargo shipment. We have been harrassing them enough they cannot waste the rescources sending a full blown entourage with it so they are counting on secrecy. I want you to intercept those plans and capture the data. The cargo shuttle is also making a drop off before it heads to Kaut. This will be our only chance to capture it. The delivery is in the Bandomeer System. I'm going to need you to stay here Jax we have something to discuss and so work to do so Lt. Zim you the mission leader for this operation. I have a mission breakdown for you you have till tomorrow to requisition any vehicles or supplies you may need. Any questions?"

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **ganthet** (2008-06-25 13:40:59)

"So you would like us to ambush the ship before or after it makes the drop off?" Deel asks. He enjoyed his vacation, but it was nice to be back to work.
He also had the driod of Meeto's to work on to. His life always seem to be one project after another, but that was what his contribution to freeing the of the galaxy was and he was proud to give all he had.

ANtur takes up a seat next to Arty and though Bail`s briefing may have been well spoken Antur does not clue in until Bail states ("you have till tomorrow to requisition any vehicles or supplies you may need"). Antur smiles like a kid in a candy store "Astromech droid, can I get one of those?"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-06-25 14:55:18)

As the squad returned to the Tantive IV, Jordan couldnÂ´t say he wasnÂ´t happy. He never liked the SmugglerÂ´s Moon, and was glad to be bacl where he belonged.
As Bail Organa explained the mission to them, he can only agree that this mission is of high priority. The last thing they would want is for the Empire to start producing new ships far superior to their old ones. It sounded like a simple mission, but that counts for nothing is his experience.

Meeto listens to the mission debriefing and questions, but has nothing to add. His Rodian antenna's perk up when Bail puts Zim in charge.A silent congratulatory smile is smirked toward Zim, almost mocking the fact that he had to lead us into battle. Meeto was just happy enough behind a kiosk or working on a droid rather than having the responsibilities of leadership.

Zim was pleased the Senator thought enough of his potential to place him in a position of authority. Before giving any outward reaction, he waited for the answer to Deel's question. Were they to take the shuttle before, during or after the scheduled drop off?

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-06-26 10:26:07)

The Senator looks at Deel.
"You can hit it either before or after it's drop off. If you hit it before you could capture what ever supplies it's delivering to Bandomeer."

"From what out intelligence reports the cargo is of low value basic supplies. There seems to be no escort but the Lambda has been modified with higher grade weapons and shields for self-defense. Reports also show that an elite crew has been assigned to pilot the shuttle. Hand picked by Admiral Tarkin himself if rumors are to be believed."

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **master_Tru** (2008-06-26 13:29:56)

Antur looks around to his squad then back to Bail "Hand picked by Admiral Tarkin, this can`t just be a simple cargo run of low value basic supplies. There must be more to this. How reliable are your intelligence reports?"

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-06-26 14:22:06)

The Senator looks slightly annoyed at Antur
"Lt. Cage if you could keep your attention off of Lt. Pyuuma long enough to listen to my initial briefing you would have heard that they are also using this cargo run as cover for transporting the new technical data for a new kind of Star Destroyer. That is why there is a hand picked crew. The actaul cargo is of little real value but the data is what we want."

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **ganthet** (2008-06-26 14:47:59)

Deel trys to cover his amusment at Antur expence. "We will give it our all Senator Organa." Deel says. "Is there any other info you can give us about the mods they have done to the shuttle that might help?" Deel starts to go over in his head of what they could have up graded on the lambda's weapons and shields.
(OCC: Mechcanics Check +13 to figure out the upgrades.)

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-06-27 02:13:12)

Arty had as always taken the seat beside the Captin and had smiled shyly at the pilot that sat on her other side. During the briefing she took up her usual position of head laying on her arms, though this was half for listening purposes and half for glancing at Antur. She had started to grin at the notion of a new mission only to snap her eyes open and stare at the senator and then over to the Captin; she couldn't remember the last time she had been on a mission without him.
At the Senator's words to Antur of keeping his attention off of her person she couldn't help but blush and look over to the pilot with a smile, for the moment her horror of not being near her friend gone. But only for a moment as her mind quickly brought it back to the forefront and she poked her Captin and whispered to him "you aren't coming??"

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-06-27 10:14:41)

The Captain leans over to Arty.
"Not this time kid, make sure they keep my baby in one piece."
Deel notes that the modular design of the Lambda's systems makes it real easy to modify or replace equipment. They could have almost any weapons config excluding turbolasers.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **master_Tru** (2008-06-27 10:26:23)

A little red in the face Antur pauses before making a response "We will need everyone we can muster for a boarding party, these guys will have good training. I can pilot the Void one for this run keep the Y-wings safe, that way we wil all be ready for boarding." Antur sheepishly looks back to Arty then to the group "Its an idea."

'I feel safer you protecting us from enemy fighters, besides you can still dock with VS1 and board with us if the situation calls for it. Now with Jake gone, we are going to need another fighter pilot to protect VS1 and to help Antur destroy enemy escort fighters.'
Meeto looks to Zim waiting for him to say something on the subject

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-27 20:35:22)

"Yes, I agree with Meeto. We need at least one of VS2 or VS3 in action, just in case there are any surprises we need to be ready for. Antur is too good a pilot to not be in one of the fighters."

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-06-27 22:21:15)

Arty pouts at the Captin but still pats his arm "you know I won't let anyone hurt her too bad if I can help it." She looks over to Antur at his suggestion, she would rather have him on VS1 with her, but they were right. She lightly lays her hand on his and leans in to whisper "they're right Antur...as much as I wanna disagree with the whole lot they're right, you're a great pilot and we'll need you to protect us from the other pilots out there."

Zim: "How 'bout it, Deel? I know you will do everything in your power to keep anything from damaging one of your toys--doing that might keep us safe, too. I think you would be a fine XO."
Turning to face the rest of the squad, Zim smiles and says: "Antur, you do need to take one of the fighters to provide cover in case of any surprises. We can leave the other ship behind, if we care concerned about having a larger boarding party. Deel can run everything from VS 1 while the rest of us board the shuttle. Any opinions or suggestions?"

Deel starts to feel the wieght of his new postion sink in alittle. *"Hoe am I going to handle all of this."* he thinks to himself. "Well if anyone needs me I will be in the hanger checking over the ships." Deel turns and heads out of the conferance room toward the hanger.

"When your head is deep in the circuitry compartment, and your hands are covered with enough grease so you can't hold a hyperspanner in the middle of battle, keep a level head."

After Zim's statement, the Rodian's face looks as if he just saw a ghost and with his jaw dropping open at the thought.
"You wouldn't......!"
Moving to look more productive
"I got work to do Sir, I'm on it! Never to fear when Meeto's on the job. I got droids to work on, ship repairs..."
Meeto moves out of the debriefing room to finish modification to VS1 and when he has time he works on the Astromech Droid and Labor Droid.
"Deel meet me in engineering I have something for you."
((OOC: I want to clean and repair any of the used parts before I start putting the Astro Droid together, I will spend most of my time working on repairing the processor. I want to diagonose the Labor Droid, see if the memory is clean or not. I may want to do some re-programming on both droids. My main concern is to get VS1's modification upgrades and systems working with the crew before I tinker.))

'Sorry Deel that's never gunna get old.' Unsheathing the remote droid from under the dirty rag. The remote droid is inactive, and bit beaten up with worn parts and signs of scorch burns.
'I found one, its not exactly new, but I was able to clean it up a bit on the trip back from Nar Shaadar. Seems to be in good working order'

He looks up at Meeto. "Well most of the mods are in and running great. I was just checking over VS1's systems to make sure everything is ready and then I was going to check over whatever fighters Zim wants to use for the mission." Deel looks back down at the remote driod. "Where ever you guys want to start is great."

'No seriously, it costs 1200 credits.' Meeto looks at Deel with a straight face waiting for his payment.
The young Rodian wasn't rich, and the only gift Meeto was giving was his time to pick it up for Deel. No fool would just give 1200 credits worth of product away unless he was getting something back.

The ships have all been refuel,restocked and rearmed. The voidstalkers are assembled in the flight deck by Lt Olan. They are waiting for orders from Lt. Zim.

Zim: "Nice to see everyone on time for once," he laughs. The plan is we take the shuttle after it makes its stop. Hopefully they will be paying less attention at that point. As we anticipate a tougher than normal crew, as we attempt to board, we will only be taking VS 1 and 2. Antur, you are in 2, as usual. The remainder of us will make up the boarding party, except for Deel who can run everything on VS 1 while we are boarding. Last chance for any suggestions before we head out."

Arty glances over to Antur at the mention of him being in the flyer still, nudging his shoulder to get his attention "Good luck, and don't get hurt or anything we still have a dinner to have together."

Deel head sinks. "Well at least i will have XO to help me out." Deel feels like the weight of the world is on his solders. "Unless there is anything else I would like to get started on pre- flight checks, and maybe learn to pilot the ship better." Deel says with a smile.

"Hopefully, you won't have to pilot much, Deel. Just hold'er steady while we are in and out..." Zim tells Deel, smirking at the ball of nerves the engineer had lapsed into. "You'll do fine."

### **master_Tru** (2008-07-21 18:13:46)

Antur gives Zim a salute " Yes sir! This should give me a chance to test out a few maneuvers." Antur smiles when Arty nudges him and whispers back "Its the after dinner I am looking forward to." Antur returns the nudge against Arty`s shoulder.

### **zerah** (2008-07-21 19:15:59)

Arty turns away slightly and flushes brightly "Antur!" she giggles nudging his shoulder back, she glances at him and blushes again. Still, gathering up the courage she leans over and kisses his cheek then rushes after Deel to help him, laughing all the way.

The Voidstalkers make the jump into hyperspace with no problems. The next few days slip by with nothing out of the ordinary. The mass shadow alarm rings out letting you all know that the ship has entered a mass shadow of something in real space. The hyperdrive emergency protocols rip the ship out of hyperspace. Meeto is on duty in the cockpit most likely playing some game on the ships computer. He manages to hop in the pilot seat and prevent the ship from colliding with a very large asteroid in the space lane.

Arty had been walking down the hall back to her room, a glass of water in one hand and a holobook in the other. She had almost reached her room when the alarm went off bringing her attention up from her book; she stumbles slightly when the ship is brought out of hyperdrive some water spilling out "what the..wonder what..-" the rest is cut off by a loud yelp as the ship moves quickly causing her to loose her balance and wall into the wall, the water spilling onto her, her book dropping to the floor followed by the rest of her in a brused and wet heap "...ow.."

Awoken by a loud thump which turned out to be Antur`s head against the bunk Antur grudgingly gets to his feet. "I knew I should be the only one flying." Half dressed Antur runs out of Arty`s room with the rest of his clothes in hand. This would come to yet another bump as Antur trips over Arty, managing a slight smile Antur looks at Arty "Morn hon you ok?"

Picking himself off the ground from the sudden stop of the VS 1, Zim quickly goes over the roster in his head. Meeto was flying. "Meeto, put your game down, and please get us back on course," Zim comlinks the rodian, guessing what the issue was.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-07-22 21:20:59)

Arty lets out an 'oof' as someone trips over her, glancing over she chuckles softly "Morning, sleep well?" she looks around them, at the glass on the floor, her book on the other side and down at her clothing now soaked with water. She sighs "I need to change clothes now...who was flying anyway?" Glancing back over to the pilot that was also her bunkmate she flushed, taking in note that he was half dressed. The more logical of her mind telling her he always slept like that and she should be used to it but at the same time it was like seeing him again for the first time.

Deel alseep in his bunk data pads and filmsy laying on his chest is woken by the sudden movement of the ship and floor racing up to meet his face. "Bork that hurt." Getting up quickly and grabing his tools he stubles out of the room into the hall still checking his nose to see if it is broken. Seeing arty on the floor water all down the front of her. and Antur coming out of there room half dressed. "What did we hit? And who is flying this thing?" The words coming out kind of muffled because he is try to stop his nose from bleeding. Deel trys to help Arty up and makes his way to the cocpit.

Rubbing a new bump on his head Antur responds "It could have been better." Antur smiles and give Arty a wink. Getting up Antur notices Deel, and is rudly interrupted again "Oh its your Deel, not sure who is flying right now." Antur holds out a hand to help Arty up then puts his shirt on "I would help you with that Arty but I think I am needed on the bridge." Smiling Antur steals a quick kiss before charging towards the bridge. "I will save you a seat Arty, come on Deel we might need something fixed."

Taking the offered hand of both men she smiles as finally she was back on her feet only to stand in shock at the small kiss that was stolen. Watching the pilot run off as her face turned a bright red. idly she thanked Deel for helping her before walking into her room, a slight dreamy kind of look on her face as she went about gathering dry clothes.

### **Frost** (2008-07-23 14:22:35)

Deel and Antur make it to the bridge. Meeto is frantically trying to control the ship as he weaves around the asteroid. The three of you see a large cylindrical shape through the cockpit window. A quick sensor scan confirms your fears. Its an Imperial Dreadnaught. You are also picking up multiple incoming fighters of an unknown design.
*ooc:Remember Tie fighters haven't been fully implimented into Imperial navy so none of you have seen them before.*

Get everyone to there stations on the double, we need to get out of here." Deel switches on the ships internal comm system. "Zim you may want to get up here!" After that Deel starts to check the ships system and rasies the shields. "I hope these mods we made work as good as I hope they do."

Half way through dressing did the alarm go off, making the girl sigh and look down to the clean and dry clothes on the bed longingly. Arty sighs again but redresses in the wet ones before running out to her turret and putting on her headset "figures that when I try to change clothes something happens....what happened anyway?"

The hyperdrive and the Nav computer are both down we have everything else though." "Meeto get to work on the Nav computer try to get it running fix the corrupted data some how, I am headed to the engine room to get the hyperdrive up and running, get everyone else to the ships guns."

Antur takes the helm and runs the ship into a series of twists and turns, then circling back to use the asteroid for cover from the imperial Dreadnought. "Can we get a scan on those fighters or ships or whatever they are?"
(Full defensive, and a move)

When Deel reaches the engine room he checks over the hyperdrive. "Well all I need to do is shut it down and it will reset it self then we can get out of here fast." Deel pulls out his commlink and calls the brige. "Antur can you buy me at least 2 minutes or so? I have to shut this down and restart it." not waiting for the reply Deel begins the shut down of the hyperdrive.

Jordan was half asleep when the ship rocked heavily and he rammed his head against the table under wich he was sleeping. Cursing under his breath, and wishing he had his armor helmet to sleep in, he quickly got dressed and started off for the bridge, mumbling to himself.
As he entered the bridge, he called out even as the door opened.
"Meeto, if you fly like this in your games as well, I can understand why you practice so much..."
He was cut short though, as he saw what everyone else saw. As the status reports then showed that the ships hyperdrive was out of function, he lowered his head and drew a deep breath, and when he raised it again, it was hard and determined, a warriorÂ´s face.
"Ib'tuur jatne tuur ash'ad kyr'amur, mates. Time to show what weÂ´ve got"
As the others head off the their respective posts, Jordan makes his way to the Ion turret, powering the weapon up, ready to fight.

### **Frost** (2008-07-24 11:49:15)

OOC:Ok here is the ooc breakdown of the situation. Your hyperdrive was pulled off line by the large asteroid that just happenened to be in the normal spacelane. Its gonna take two minutes (20 combat rounds) to restart. The nav computer didn't take being ripped out of hyperspace very well it is also damaged. You have sensor contact with the Imperial Dreadnaught *Slaughter*. You also have nine contacts moving in fast some sort of fighters. They are at range twenty right now but are coming in fast. Your combat thruster let you manuever the VS1 like a starfighter. You can dog fight and capital ships like *Slaughter* have a -20 to hit you with anything other than point defense weapons. The *Slaughter* is way out of range at least 100 sq or more. I am assuming that I have Meeto on sensors, Deel in engineering, Zim at the Helm in the copilot spot, Antur is pilot, Arty is in the laser turret?, and Jordan is in an ion turret. Anyone Im forgetting? Also VS2 (Anturs Y-wing) is docked to the VS1 if you want to use it.
For simplicity Im going to only use 1 initiative for the ship based on the pilot's pilot skill. Remember piloting the VS1 has a -9 pilot check due to size. Also in Antur is flying defensivly gunners have a -5 to hit. If he is flying full defensive gunners cannot get a shot. Also for using line of sight abilities in starships you are considered to have line of sight if you have communication with someone.
Init
TIE wing 1: 17
VS1: 15
TIE wing 2: 12
TIE wing 3: 10
The ships seem to be in groups of three ion formation. They all continue to all out move towards you this round

Arty blinks at the news coming into her "oh hell...Antur? Deel? anyone up there, what's the game plan?" As a foresight to what she can only presume was going to be one hell of a fight, she begins to power up her weapon and take stock of whats going on.

The first wing of fighters comes screaming around the asteroid after you. They light the sky with laser fire but Antur's defensive flying keeps any from connecting.
*Tie wing1 Atk:18 Miss*
*ooc: Meeto XO did not have any nav points stored as far as you could tell.
As long as Antur fly's full defensive gunners cannot shoot. If you do get a chance to fire do not forget your +1 from born leader used by Zim*

Arty sits tight in her turret watching the lazer fire streak past them "what kind of fighters are those...." she wonders aloud more to herself than anyone else though it would seem she'd forgotten for a moment that she had a headset on and active. "Whoever's flying, keep flying like you are may not be able to get a shot but if I find one I'll take it."

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-07-28 14:53:17)

Jordan has barely strapped himself into the turret before the wild flying begins. As the ship twists and turns, he watches laser blasts streak by them, but he also cannot get in a shot of his own, due to the extreme movement of not only the targets, but his own ship as well.
"Wonderful flying there, but I donÂ´t think that will save us. They are too many, and I donÂ´t feel like counting on our pilotÂ´s ability to keep us safe alone. Straighten us out a bit, will you, and letÂ´s see if we canÂ´t take some of them with us"
Jordan starts to calibrate his sights to try and get a shot in even through all the defensive flying, but he quickly takes a moment to pause and observe the enemies, trying to analyze their batte tactics and find some weakness to exploit.
((When/If I get a chance to shoot, I will. +6 to attack I think, +7 if PB range. 5d10x2 Ion Damage. I will also make a Knowledge(Tactics) check to try and discover something about the enemy fighters and their attack style))

Arty thanks every star in the sky they had Antur on board, while in that same thought thanking the foresight to strap in tighter then normal. Grasping her lazer controls and waiting for the command, she sits, half enjoying the impressive turns and rolls while the other half was feeling slightly sick. All of that went away at the order to fire, and fire she did, praying she actually hit one of the fighters.

The small fighters swarm around transport blasting away. Antur does his best to shake most of them but little by little the shields start to fail. Deel and X0 work frantically to repair the damaged hyperdrive motivator. Deel thinks he has it back in working condition when the ship gets rocked hard by multiple hits. The cockpit erupts in flames as feedback rocks the ship. Panels explode and shoot shrapnel around. The ship gets hit a few more times as Antur frantically rolls away from the smaller fighters. XO frantically calculates a micro jump and activates the drive. The stars seems to streak away as you enter hyperspace. The cockpit is in shambles an Antur has several minor burns. Zim has blood rushing from a head wound and seems knocked out.

She would have hit him, or kissed him..probably hit first but he was already so badly hurt and now unconcious she just couldn't do it, though it was filed away for later as she rushed to his side.

Arty hits the coms a few times "hello?? can anyone hear me?" a few subtle curses later and she was again looking to the pilot, sighing. Lightly she unbuckles the safety restraint for him and helps him to stand, letting him lean on her as she makes an atempt to get him to the medical bay. Granted she wasn't entirely strong and he was well..heavier then she could really lift so it was not wonder when she started to falter in steps. Quickly changing positions she begins to drag him out of the cockpit.

With all the movement Antur starts to come to finding himself in Arty`s arms. At first Antur considers letting her drag him around the ship, then remembers the current situation. Smiling Antur looks at Arty "I see you can take care of me too." Still a little out of it Antur tryâ€™s to regain his footing which is made easier with Arty`s help. "Are we out of danger yet?"

Deel picks himself up off the and looks around there. Nothing was exploding any more if there was anything left. Grabing his tool kit he heads out to see if any one was hurt or injured. "Come on XO let's check on the others." Most of everything is out, Only things running Life support and the engines.
He heads out of the engine room pushing the door open power was out. Heading down the hallway he checks the damage around him, they where lucky to be alive. He heads toward the cocpit to see if his friends need help. As he gets closer to the cocpit, he sees Arty and Antur. Antur seems to be injuryed resting on Arty. "Arty how is he, and are we safe at the moment?"

As Arty begins to relay Anturs current condition he moves in and gives her a full kiss "I am feeling much better now." Turning to the cockpit "Lets get this bucket out of here, someone get on the scanners see if we are being followed. We will need a damage report as well." Still sore Antur takes his seat again and begins tapping keys trying to find out where they are.

Stunned was the word best put to the expression on Arty's face after the kiss before it melted to a rather dreamy kind of thing that had her leaning against the wall to recover for a moment. Only a moment however before she shook herself and stood moving to engineering first to make sure her little buddy was ok "X0 you still here?"

The turret took heavy damage. Jake is seriously wounded. It looks like when the turret got hit it took most of Jake with it. His right leg is impaled with shrapnel and lookes like shredded meat and his right arm is severed at the elbow.

It is not hard to hear when Jordan makes his way out of the turret and into the cockpit area, the series of curses in MandoÂ´a preceeding him.
"...*shabla osiik*, give me something to shoot at. Everybody okay?"
As he spots Zim, he pulls out a medpac and begins to try and do what he can to keep him alive. He is no medic, but he has seen enough combat injuries to know a little. As he hears ArtyÂ´s call from the turret, he lowers his head and takes a deep breath.

Seeing as Zim could finally breathe on his own, Jordan allowed himself a quick smile.
"There we go, now just stay like that. Somebody keep an eye on him. The rest of you get this ship working again, or at least donÂ´t just stand there"
Producing his medpac, Jordan started to head towards the turrets. Jake was due to be in even worse shape than Zim, especially if his turret had been even close to a direct hit.
Reaching the turret, he frowned at the sight. What a mess.
"Arty, go back to the others, this place is too cramped as it is"
Seeing the look on the womans face, the veteran soldier allows a slight crack in his hard looks and puts his hand on her shoulder.
"*Udesii, ner vod*. The rest of us are still fine"
Then he started to try and see if perhaps he could make sure that he remained the only *CuyÂ´val Dar* aboard the ship.

She grins slightly, trying to lighten the mood even if she was worried about everyone and the thought that could have been her near death in the turret.

Jordan carefully removes Jake from the remains of the turret. He manages to stauch the bleeding and torniquet up the arm and leg. The pain killers have kept him sedated and he seems stabile for now but will need surgery as soon as possible.
A few minutes later the ship drops out of hyperspace. Deel, Arty, and X0 have managed to jury rig the comm system and basic manuever thrusters. The ship handles like a Hutt's tail but its better than it was earlier. You can see the medium transport that was supposed to meet you in the distance.

"This thing is going handle like 300 ton of space junk you sure ou can handle it Antur?" "I am not much of a pilot. I would rather leave it up to someone of your skill." Deel looks at his friend and hopes he is up to it.

Upon seeing the transport, Arty sighs in relief before moving over to Antur hugging him from behind while laying her head against his shoulder. After seeing poor Jake like he was she was so thankful Antur had been somewhat ok, and that the others were safe and sound for the most part. Mumbling against his shoulder is what sounds like "I'm not giving any bad news..how about you do it Deel."

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-19 17:26:32)

Antur reaches behind himself as Arty hugs him, and returns the embrace. Broken but not beaten Antur takes comfort in the embrace. Antur lowers his head slightly "I will give the report, it was my fault I got cocky behind the yoke." Antur sets the course "We will come back from this."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-19 17:29:55)

Jordan has managed to pull Jake into a more comfortable position, and managed to stop him from dying right away. With a concerned look he returns to the cockpit, seeing that they have indeed reached their destination.
"ThatÂ´s two patched up. Now, since none of you are bleeding openly, IÂ´ll assume you can manage on your own"
He spots the transport in the distance.
"Somebody go ahead and talk to them, or I will have to. Jake and Zim - especially Jake - is going to need surgery soon, and IÂ´d rather have someone with better equipment than a screwdriver and a cutting torch do it"

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-09-19 17:41:46)

Arty idly kisses Antur's shoulder and the back of his neck "it wasn't your fault...those fighters were a lot better than us...better equipped probably too. If anything, it's not all bad, we can warn everyone about them maybe even get training for pilots and gunners." She had yet to let him go and didn't seem about to though she held a hand out to motion the droid over "you ok X0? bet you'd really like a nice bath after this huh?"

Meeto had a somber look, even for a Rodian his green skin may not have expressed his sorrow but it was obvious he wasn't happy. The seriousness of the battle and the wounded had left a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach. That was the closest he had ever come to death, and the realization of how dangerous these missions have become had him worried.
'I'll start in the cockpit, its going to need lots of rewiring.' Meeto waves his hand in the air trying to keep the smoke coming from the panels in the cockpit away from his face.

Anturs face turns serious again. "Whats with the com? Is something causing interference?" Antur begins a scan of the area and the transport. "I have a bad feeling about this." Antur slows the voidstalkers momentum to a slow crawl but try`s to make it look as if its a result of the damage taken.

### **Frost** (2008-09-20 11:06:52)

The transport moves in and locks a tractor beam on to the damaged ship. It pulls the ship into it's massive cargo bay. Medical teams rush in to deal with the wounded. Jake and Zim are rushed to surgery. Repair teams led by Deel and Meeto get to work on repairs. The damage doesn't look as bad from the outside.
The transport head into the relative safety of hyperspace. Its going to take several days to get to your destination. Zim and Jake are both in Surgery for the next several hours and in bacta for a coupla days.

After the Zim and Jake where rushed to the med bay for surgery. Deel set about fixing the damage done durring the battle. He starts in the engine room getting any bugs worked out of the enegines and the hyperdrive, and power systems. With the work crew it won't take as long as if it was just him, Arty and XO.
He works mostly on his own trying to give himself time to deal with what had happened and if any of it was his fault for not working faster to get the hyperdrive working sooner.

Several hours go by and finally Captain Jax calls you all into a briefing (Except Jake + Zim)
"I have some good and bad news. Lt. Golan is gonna pull through. They had to replace his forearm and right leg with cybernetics. He is in the bacta tanks right now healing up. ZIm how ever isn't doing as well. He pulled through surgery but seem to be in a coma of some sort."
Jax sits down at the table
"So what the frak happened out there?"

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-09-21 01:29:53)

Arty sits in the briefing room beside Antur, having really not left his side though had continued to tell him to go with her to see the medics and get him looked over. Still, under the table she held his hand during the meeting. At the mention of, well, what happened she mumbles "I've never seen fighters like those before.."

### **ganthet** (2008-09-21 01:39:40)

"We where on our way to the frist part of the mission and we where pulled out of hyperspace and attacked by some new Imperial fighters. I have never seen anything like them before they where fast and agile, they gaves us a pretty good pounding." Deel runs thought most of what had happened, it was still abit of a blur. "We bearly got the hperdrive back online in time to ecape. We can thank XO for that one, he saved our butts back there."

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-21 10:09:23)

Antur gently squeezes Arty1s hand under the table and sits a little closer to her then anyone else around him. Shaking his head at the news of his squad mates Antur asks "Well it good to hear they made it, is there anything we can do for Jake? I would raid an imperial medical facility if I thought it would help him." Antur looks around the room to whats left of his squad, then looks back to Captain Jax "The empire has again upgraded its tech. Interceptors! They where fast agile and co-ordinated. We may still have some scans on them. As for what happened, not sure if the dreadnought knew we where coming or not but they had a perfect ambush setup and we fell into it."
"Sir I am ready to go out again, we need intell, recon whatever. They need to pay for hitting us like that, and they could be hitting other rebel cells like that too."

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-21 11:02:19)

The news that Jake was okay actually came as little comfort to Jordan. Sure he was very happy that the other would recover, but the failure of the mission still nagged him. The Empire was indeed adjusting, realizing that their big bulky ship didnÂ´t quite suffice to effectively face the smaller and more agile craft of the Rebellion. Jordan didnÂ´t know what to think of this. He just knew he wanted to give something back to the imperials. As Antur spoke up, Jordan nodded, but what he was about to suggest went even further than that.
"Sir, we do need intel on these new ships. And what better way to do that than to capture one of them? We have already seen what they can do in space, so lets hit them from the ground. If we can find out where these ships are being produced, we can send in a small commando team to steal some of them, and hopefully deal a heavy blow to their production chains as well"

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-09-21 11:46:28)

Arty looks over to Antur as he speaks about to comment that he'd be damn well ready to go back out when he would let a medic look him over, but wasn't able to get it out just yet as Jordan spoke. Steal a ship? that would be a good idea..the process of getting it though..

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-09-21 15:26:28)

Jax processes the information.
"Our Intel reports that the Empire has set up massive factories all over the galaxy to mass produce these new fighters. We are analyzing the sensor readings from the ship. We are being given a new assignment for the time being. As soon as Jake is back on his foot again we are supposed to meet with some Wookie representatives. Apparently they want our help dealing with transdotian slavers."

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-21 16:51:40)

A little disappointed that he was being dismissed from pursuing these new fighters just like that, Jordan couldnÂ´t say that he was unhappy with his new assignment. They would be sent to aid a species that he held in high regards - the Wookies - and would likely get to kill one that he didnÂ´t quite cared for at all - the Trabdoshans.

"Just these things to finish sir." Deel hands the data pad to the captain. He looks kind of worn because of the time he has spent working on the Viodstalker. He hasn't left the hanger expect to eat and that was rare. He had been surviving on Caff most of the time. XO and the techs assigned to help him were is only contacts.

'About those fighters. Scanners were working for awhile before they went down. Antur's ship's targeting systems in still intact, we can extract all information from our first contact. Our ships scanners may have picked up some information that could be used. I will concentrate my work in recovering any information from the ships damaged computer and sensor array, and Antur's ship.

The medical bay is quiet except for the beeping of monitors. You find Jake being attended to by a medical droid. The droid is applying a dermal sheath over Jake's new forearm. The droid applies the last bits then asks Jake to do a full range of motion test. The hand responds just like the original. Next to Jake in an isolation booth is Zim. He is hooked up to monitors and feeding tubes.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-09-22 13:17:26)

Not that he had to pull very hard to get her to follow, Arty might as well have been guled to his hand for how often she left his side since they returned to the transport. Glad though she was that Jake had recovered enough to get out of the tank and have visitors. Arty quickens her pace so she was right beside the pilot, mumbling softly "Should have known Jake wouldn't have wanted to sit around in a bacta tank for too long."
Entering the Med bay she smiles over to Jake, waving as she catches a glimpse at what the droid was doing "Does this mean we'll have to do maintence on you too now Jake?" she grins and chuckles softly, waiting till she was close enough before leaving Anturs side to give the other a hug, then returns to the pilot glancing over to Zim with a sigh.

Jake does as the med droid asks and wiggles his fingers and rotates his wrist. "Seems to be good as new, will there break in time for this or will I be good to go right off the cuff?" He asks the droid as he sees his squad mates walk in and smiles big.
He flexes his right leg that they also replaced seeing that it is also performing well. "Good as new guys. Thought it looks like I'll be setting off metal detectors now but its a small price to pay for looking and getting around normal."
He looked over at Zim and his smile fades. "He's still beat up pretty bad." He says with a bit of frustration in his voice.

"Great something else I'll have to work on." He is glad to see Jake looking well, hopefully he will back to duty soon. "Maybe when your done relaxing, you can help me check out the repairs on the ship."

At the questions about being cleared for duty he figured he was. "I'm feeling fine Captain and as far as I know I am cleared for duty. Anything is better than being in here or the tank." He said as he let his feet fall over the edge and slid off the bed onto his feet.
He looked at Deel. "I'd be happy to give you a hand on the repairs. I have an idea on that. Maybe we can used some heavier or shielded wiring that can take the strain of getting ripped out of hyperspace like we were."

"That might help, the hyperdrive scramed when the ship was jerked out of hyperspace like it was." " The shield generator we installed, did it job the damage could have been alot worse." Deel goes over his data pad some more. "I would love to get my hands on the plans for those new fighters we ran into, I bet we could learn a thing or two from them." Deel is just expressing is intrest in figureing out away to even the playing field. "Well if you guys will excuss me I have aton of work to do. Jake I will see you later."

Meeto shared his comrades happiness in seeing Jake healthy again, but the grim reminder of something worse overwhelmed the Rodian when he saw Zim's body being sustained by droids and machines. Meeto moved to give Zim a hardy shake with his new hand, and as he was shaking it he brought it closer for a good look.
'Oh they do nice work around here.' The Rodian says to break the ice. 'Good to see you well Zim.' Rodian sounds of joy follow.

Jake shook Meeto's hand and then grinned when he took a closer look at it and praised the quality of the work that was done. "They only give the best for their best squadron. How could I be expected to blast Imps out of the air with sub-par cybernetics?" He said with a chuckle.
Glad to be on his feet again and looked around at those who had come to see him and Zim. he felt truly lucky to be with this group. They weren't just a squadron they were becoming a family and that suited him just fine. He quickly walked over to Zim and bent down close. "Hang in there buddy, you'll be up and around in no time."
As he stood up the Captain asked for a few minutes with Zim and directed them to go to the mess hall. "Alright Captain. Actually some food sounds real good about now. It's not like they feed you in the tank."
He fell in line with the others as they left. "Hey Antur we get and intel on those fighters?"

Arty tugs on Anturs hand as the group made their way out, though she paused and doubled back; giving the captin a hug. Being on the ship during that fight reminded her of last time, at least in this encounter they got out of it alive for the most part.

"WeÂ´re not sure yet Jake. They have people looking at it right now. In case you didnÂ´t hear, weÂ´re being sent on a sidetrack. The wookies need help, and weÂ´re being sent in to take care of a lizard problem"

Jax hugs Arty back and whispers something in her ear.
[hide]"Don't become to attached Arty, odds are most of us won't live through this conflict, and your to precious to be hurt that badly."[/hide]
He squeezes Arty tighter then lets her go.
"I'll be there in a few minutes have three shot of corellian whiskey waiting for me."
He looks at Zim
"Better make it four."

Antur smiles back at Jake "Yea we got a little intel on them, nothing as in depth as actually getting a hold of one though. If I had even a few minutes with one of those fighters the rebellion would know every weakness they had." Antur shakes his head as he thinks back on the mission how it failed. Not a complete failure though his friend Jake was still alive and they had some intel.
Antur slows down while he talks with Jake to let Arty catch up to him as she checks in with the captain. Its less a thought to do so at this point and more natural that he is close by her side. "So did they give you any upgrades their Jake, I know you will need every little edge you can get to keep up to me in a snub." Antur jests and pats his fellow pilot on the back.

### **zerah** (2008-09-23 12:46:37)

Arty sighs and nods her head, glancing to Antur's back with a soft smile "sometimes you gotta take a chance at getting hurt." she grins and kisses his cheek "I'll have your drinks waiting...don't be too long.." she gives his shoulder a squeeze and jogs to catch up, taking the pilots hand in her own with a soft smile.

Jake looks at his new cybernetics as Jake jokes with him. He does a half smile. "The doc told me that I now have more natural fight talent in my hand and leg that the two of us will ever have." He lets his arm fall to his side.
"No, they are normal cybernetics built to function as my normal ones would have. It's an odd feeling though. I can still feel my forearm, hand, and leg even though I know they aren't there. Phantom pain or something like that they called it." He slowed down with his wingman to wait for Arty.
"As long as they work up to spec I'll be happy." He spotted Arty walking towards them. "Things getting serious with you two?" Jake tone wasn't one of nosiness or non-approval. It was more of two of his friends find something to hold on to the craziness of this war.

Deel slowly walks down the hall toward looking over the stuff on his data pad. "We'll get are chance guys, one of these days." Deel trys to keep his optamizum up. With Jake out of the medbay, things where looking up. "Why don't we get down to the officers mess, I for one could use some food, I havn't eatin in atleast 12 hours. " Deel smiles and heads down the hall.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-09-23 13:05:56)

The officer's mess is full of off duty personnel drinking and having a good time. There is music playing and even a Gungan dancer performing to the music. You find a table together and have a seat. A droid wheels over and asks if you would like anything.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-23 13:10:24)

At seeing Jake`s reaction to his jest Antur falls silent for a second. Then looks back to his wing man to answer his question about Arty before she catches up to them. In a whisper "I hope so. She is great and the only thing that makes sense to me about this whole damn war." Holding his hand out to Arty as she catches up Antur changes the subject. "I am glad you made it Jake I had real doubts that any of the rebellion recruits could come close to filling your shoes."
Hearing Deels suggestion Antur smiles "You know that's not a bad idea and I think you still owe me a drink Jake for our last match." Antur laughs then whispers to Arty "Would you join me for a drink?" which is followed by a sly wink.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Yogi** (2008-09-23 13:12:48)

Jake sat down and ordered a mess of food and drink. He had been in the bacta tank for a bit with no real food. His stomach was telling him it was time to eat. It was one request he wasn't going to ignore. After he ordered he saw the looks from the others.
"What? I'm hungry."

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-09-23 13:17:57)

Arty blushes but grins all the same at him "I'd love to." she kisses his cheek with a soft laugh as they walk. Once in and a seated in the mess hall, she orders 4 shots of corellian whiskey that she'll set aside for the captin when he arrived. She glances to Antur though and twirls a peice of hair around her finger "never been one for anything really strong, can you recommend anything?" she moves slightly closer to the pilot looking over to the dancer and clapping at the end of one song and the start of another.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

The Captain joins you after a few minutes he quickly pounds down all four shots and waves for the droid server.
"Bring us another round on me."

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-09-23 13:32:41)

"Sometimes but my policy is drink it now taste it later."
He winks at Arty then looks over at Antur. His demeanor looks sour. He leans over and says in a gruff voice.
"If you hurt her in anyway I will personally shove you out an air lock and use you for target practice with my Y-wing."

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-23 13:36:10)

Looking at Arty Antur replies "Most pilots drink after burners, but that's a hard drink to take, nothing you can`t handle though. Me I am thinking the corellian whiskey will be just fine."
"Ah Captain have a seat, you are getting the next round after all." Antur motions to an empty seat at the table.

Deel sets down at the table and orders a bantha burger and tubelyers, a furit juice. Looking at the others. "So we are getting a doctor huh, thats good. I think he will work out fine." While waiting for his order Deel gose over his data pad somemore he calls up the statis report on the ship and what work was left to do.

### **zerah** (2008-09-23 13:57:42)

Arty stares at the captin and then the pilot, how could he say that?? and why wasn't Antur even flinching???? The woman sighs, shaking her head at the two of them before simply bopping each over the head and ordering two corellian whiskey's for herself. Once they arrive she downs both quickly though not without a shudder.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-23 14:03:51)

Antur rubs the spot where Arty bopped him "Hey now that could have been a wound. What did I do anyway?" Antur chuckles a little then whispers back to the captain. "Maybe you should worry more about me getting hurt then her." His face turns serious for a second as he continues to whisper to the captain "I may be a pilot but I am not one of your run of the mill rebel snub ace`s out for thrills, sir."

### **Frost** (2008-09-23 14:10:25)

Jax pounds another shot down. He looks at Antur then at Arty. He shakes his head and waves for another shot.
"You better not be."
He finally smiles and leans back in his chair.
A group of fighter pilots have gathered around the dancing gungan and have started to heckle him.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-09-23 14:14:03)

Letting the 'boys' talk..or..bond..whatever it was men did when talking like that Arty turns in her seat to watch the dancer only to see the other fighters. Finding it rather rude since the dancer really was very good and it wasn't very often entertainment was in the area, the woman stands and moves to the fighters, looking over their flightsuits for the ranking group leader. Finding this harder, she rolls her eyes and simply calls out "Hey! which one of you is ranking leader of this group?"

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Yogi** (2008-09-23 16:51:43)

Jake watches the antics at the table as he finished off the double barbecued bantha burger and moves on to the the spices potatoes. The Corellian ale helps wash it all down. "Ahh that's better.
He noticed the other fighter jocks giving the dancer a rough time. He was sitting back with his hands behind his head and Arty called out to the group. *Oh boy this could get interesting* He thought to himself.
"Captain when was the last time there was a face off here in the mess hall? We best keep tabs on whats going on. I'd hate to ruin my dinner?"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-23 18:18:37)

While Jordan ejoyed spending time with his friends, he had never been much of a drinker. He just had some light food, and nothing heavy to drink. He watched Jake stuff himself full, glad to see the man back in action. He paid only a slight attention to the Captain and Antur, and smiled a little at their conversation. He couldnÂ´t say that he had anything against what Antur and Arty were doing, as long as it didnÂ´t bring them to do anything stupid.
His attention was caught, however, when several pilots stared gathering around the gungan dancer. He watched them for a while, and saw Arty rise and walk over to them, calling out to them. He hoped that she could work it out, but just in case he rose from his chair. He had a pretty good idea that he had an intimidating build, and it had served him well before in dissuading people from causing any trouble when he was around. WarriorÂ´s glow in his eyes and stone-faced, he starts to walk over to Arty.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-23 19:34:51)

Watching Arty take the lead and challenge the rash pilots Antur smiles, stands and starts over towards the group. "So captain you where saying?" Antur makes a last jest at the captains original comment about hurting Arty. Walking up to the group Antur not wanting to take any of Arty`s fire stands beside her crosses his arms "Yea you heard her!"

Metto was hungry too, not so ravished as Zim, but the Rodian ordered too much food. He was enjoying the mixed green vegetables and various assortment of protein beans. It was to Meeto's liking and he accompanied his meal with several high sugar and caffeinated carbonated drinks. Enjoying the company of his friends and food Meeto finally relaxed for the first time since the failed mission.
'Zim I can't keep up with your stomach.' The Rodian jests as he sits back and relaxes himself on his full stomach. The thin rodian could eat, but his frame certainly could have fooled anyone. Some food was left on his plate as he couldn't finish the whole serving.
Meeto watches as Arty moves to play mediator and says as she's leaving, 'Fight the good Fight.' Meeto can't help but chuckle.

A couple of the pilots looks at you as you approach but the rest continue to jeer the gungan. One of the rolls his bottle towards the feet of the gungan who manages to step on it and tumbles to the ground in a heap. The whole bar starts laughing.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-24 12:13:16)

Jordan walks up behind Antur and Arty.
"Yeah, thatÂ´s real mature. LetÂ´s see just how much guts he has"
He moves forward towards the pilot who rolled the bottle.
"You felt good about that pal? Because even though it may have looked like fun I think that you owe our gungan friend here an apology. I suggest you give it to him"
He talks with a calm and controlled voice, as if stating the most obvious of facts.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-09-24 12:18:50)

Arty lets the other fighter handle the bottle roller while hse moves to the gungan and helps him up, giving a dirty look to all those that were laughing. She was never one to humiliating someone, and wasn't about to stand for it.

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-24 12:24:17)

Antur has a look of shock on his face that his own people would be so rude. Clearly upset at this point Antur yells out at the pilots "Thatâ€™s very imperial of you, how would your commanding officer react to this kind of slag! In fact where is your commanding officer? None of you deserve your wings!"

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Yogi** (2008-09-24 12:31:16)

Jake watched the incident and stood up from the table. *Stang!* He thought to himself. Nothing got Jake's blood boiling more than senseless cruelty. In fact Antur hit it right on the head. It was very "Imperial" of them. He moved slowly towards the gathering to back up his teammates just in case the fodder hit the fan.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-09-24 12:41:13)

The pilots all notice you now. Thier flight patches id them as members of Alpha squadron.
The bottle roller looks you all over and says
"Well well well if it isn't the voidstalkers. I heard you guys completely blew your last mission and barely limped home. You guys should be reassigned to garbage scow duty. Somewhere safe ya know."
His wingmates chuckle at this.
"As far as froggy here goes its their fault we even have an empire. Naboo led the charge to grant the Chancellor emergency powers which he never gave back and now we're where we are."

Deel sees all of his shipmates get up and help out the Gungan who was getting herased by some other pilots. shaking his head. "We just got out of one fight and they want to pick another." He looks at the captain. "Well I guess it was going to happen adventually."
Deel stands and walks over to his friends. Arms crossed waiting for something to happen. He is hopeing that they will realize that the fight will be pointless and move on.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Yogi** (2008-09-24 12:57:01)

Jake pipes up. "There was more going on at that time then anyone of us know about. To pin this all on the people of Naboo is plain wrong. If you're going to do that then you might as well blame your parents for the way you look."
Jake wasn't too happy and all could see it.

Still upset Antur continues to barrage alpha squad. "Oh so now your diplomatâ€™s too, perhaps you should stop flying training snubs and begin some real missions." Antur removes his ranking insignia and pockets it ready for the worse. "And as for that garbage scow I would appreciate it if you left your mothers ship out of this!" At this time Antur has his finger pointing in the face of the individual who made the comment in the first place.

After hearing the Alpha squad pilot insult the Voidstalker, saying that it should be hauling garbage. Deel starts to take this fight alittle more seriously. "Did you just insult the Voidstalker! It could out fly your ships any day of the week!" " If you guys where as good as you cliam you wouldn't be here flying centery duty, you would out there where the real action is!" Most of his friends have never Deel this upset before. It is one thing to insult him an intirely other thing to insult his ship.

Daxxon Younge enters the Officers Mess, though he was still new about finding his way around, the argument he could hear outside caught his attention as it did others he was sure. Daxx notices a group of two people arguing, a Gungan being helped up from the ground, and thinks ~Well if it wasn't for stupid squabbles I wouldn't get paid at all~. Daxxon looks over to Jax and heads over to Him and puts his Medical Kit off his back next to the Table, then look back towards the two squabbling groups as he sits down and loudly asks "Well you did pay me, so which of those Nerf Herders will I be patching up and which of them am I gonna be sending to the Bacta Tank?" as he taps his Fingers on his Heavy Blaster sitting now in his lap with a glare that shows he means it.

"Well the one standing up for the Gungan are your squadron. The other *Echutas* are members of Alpha Squadron. They're ok pilots but most of them come from worlds the empire's oppressed the hardest. Not thats its an excuse to be assholes but..."
He pounds another shot and stands up.
"AT EASE Maggots. Alpha get your scrawny asses back to your billet. Void stand down now!! Arty help our friend up."
Jax points to the Gungan.
He looks at Alpha
"You ever start anything like that again and I will unleash my rancors on you."

"NOW GO!"
Alpha mumbles and complains but backs down and leaves.

Daxxon take the Bottle and pours himself a shot and as soon as he puts the bottle down he has already swallowed his shot and slams the Shot Glass down and recoils some from the taste. "Question is am I gonna have to worry about them picking a fight about everything that's wrong in the Galaxy.." Daxxon sits back in the chair crossing his arms "Because bravery and stupidity can get people killed with nothing to show for it." Daxxon eyes the others looking for a reaction from them, trying to see how they will respond.

He turns back to Jax.
"YouÂ´re the boss captain, but if you ask me, no good can come from letting them behave like they do"
He raises his voice just enough so that Alpha should still hear him.
"Say what you will about the clone troopers, but at least they were *soldiers* and not second-class thugs"

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-09-24 16:08:31)

Jax looks at Lt Revv for a moment.
"And you remember that those clone troopers you value so highly were designed to be sooldier from the moment of thier conception. The people you see around here had alot of things taken from them by those same clones in different armor. These people.."
He gestures around the bar
"..arn't genetically engineered soldiers most of the were civilians before the Empire took thier normal lives away. They chose to stand up for thier freedom and the freedom of others, they may not be perfect but they are soldiers and freedom fighters just like you. Some even died for it"
Jax sits back down and pounds another shot. He motions for you all to sit back down.

Arty mutters various curses and insults under her breath at the alpha squad. Most refuring to the fact the suppossed big dogs were running away with their tails between their legs. After a few more choice insults in a variety of languages she helps the gungan up with a smile "you alright there buddy? Don't worry about the bullies they got nothin on us." She would help him to stand and motion Antur ovevr to them as she began introductions "I'm Artemis, Arty for short. And that's Antur." she motions to the pilot "as mangy mutts said we're with the voidstalker."

Jake walked back to the table with the others both happy and frustrated. Happy that this was resolved without bloodied noses, frustrated that he really wanted to vent on something. He knew that the Alpha guys weren't the ones he wanted to vent on but what they were doing was just plain wrong.
He heard the comment from the newcomer at the table sitting with the Captain. He sat looking at the FNG. "It's not about picking a fight about everything that is wrong in this stanged up galaxy. It's seeing something that is just plain wrong and standing up for what is right. The way they were acting they should have went out for the Imperial Acadamy instead. I hear that type of behavior is rewarded there. Of course the Imps only fight when the odds are 5 to 1 like just a moment ago."
He sat back in his chair and pushed what ever was left on his plate away since his appetite was no longer there.

Jordans face could have been set in stone.
"I am sure they had good reasons to join our fight captain, and they deserve some credit for that. But they have **no** reason to behave like that, and at least I will never tolerate it. If we canÂ´t weed this kind of behaviour out from our own, what will stop us from becoming just like the Empire?"
He finishes his drink in a single sweep.
"With all due respect captain, I think I will retire for the night"
He throws the newcomer a greeting look.
"Nice to see you. IÂ´m sure weÂ´ll get around to talking later"
With that he turns around and walks out of the bar, and off into the night.

The purple-skinned Gungan was being helped on his three stubby toed feet. This particular Gungan was tall and lanky. His face had a long bill with eye stalks that protruded from the top of his head. The amphibious being had long floppy ears that resembled fins and had a long neck extending from his thin build. His arms were long and floppy, with 4 fingers on each hand. He was wearing an extravagant red shimmering vest with no undershirt, and long pants that matched his vest. His eyes blinked with curiosity as he looked at Arty.
"Deysa no liken dee shaken shake, meybee dats why yousa helpin mesa? Yousa wanten doin again?" The Gungan said in a gruff and deep voice. Yet when he spoke, he gave off a clumsy yet confident aura.

Arty blinks, she'd never actually heard a gungan talk before and it took her a minute to understand what in the world he was talking about. "wanten doin again? oh...OH! you mean dancing again? Yes I think it'd be very nice! and the mutts were being rude and well...I personally won't stand for that." She looks around "hey...what're you doin here anyway?"

The excited Gungan points to a blanket where there was a very meager amount of credits laying down. Apparently, he was trying to raise morale for members of the Rebellion and make a name for himself. However, he also seemed interested in making a profit at the moment, despite the fact that many patrons weren't enjoying the performance. He seemed ignorant to the fact that no one was interested in his antics.

Jake heard the blaster fire as he saw Arty move and the sickening smell of a blaster burn as the young woman fell to the floor. Instinct took over. "Everyone down!" Not having a weapon on him as he just left the med bay he grabbed the large mug of Corellian ale he was drinking from and hurled it at the blaster wielding Alpha Squadron member.
Standard action to attack. move action to grab the mug. two swift actions to take aim
Thrown attack. +3(BAB) + 4 (dex) -5 improvised thrown weapon = +2 to hit.
Post updated.

The scene before him is set in a slow motion, that Antur is powerless to prevent. Seeing Arty take a hit Antur lunches into a fit of rage and charges at the assailant. Muttering some form of enraged roar Antur runs all out to tackle the individual bare handed.

Antur charges across the room and runs up a chair and uses a table to launch himself at the shooter. He flies into the shooter grappling for the blaster as they both hit the ground.
*Move action: move across the room
Standard action: Grapple check Antur +3 roll 17 Shooter roll 12 Grappled
Falling down is just GM flavor text lol

Jake leaps to his feet a split second after Antur and follows his friend after the shooter. Jake pulls up as the two fall to the ground. Jake realizing that Antur has probably lost it goes for the shooters arm in an attempt to help restrain the man. He also realizes he may have to hold Antur back if things get out of hand. The last thing they need is one of their own brought up on charges.

Move action: move across room
Standard action: Grapple check on shooter.

Jake rushes to aid Antur between the two of them they manage to pin down the shooter.
Jakes cybernetic hand clamps down on the shooters throat and pins him down. The shooters eyes have a wierd red tint to them.
Jax is right behind him he grabs the gun away from the shooter while Antur and Jake hold him down.

### **Yogi** (2008-09-25 12:27:28)

Between the Antur, Jax, and himself they managed to subdue the man. As they struggle to hold him down Jake notices his eyes. There was something that wasn't right.
"Captain," Jake said. "Look at his eyes. Something isn't right with him."

Antur still a little lost in anger continues to press his elbow into the alpha squad pilot. A little more angered that Jake took the mans blaster away, he had wanted to club him with it. When Jake makes the comment about the man not looking right Antur is not sure which he is referring to. With the pilot disabled Antur does risk a look back to Arty to see if she is ok.

The Shooter starts fighting back but can resist the three pilots holding him down. He is starting to froth at the mouth.

As Deel was heading to the hanger to finish his work he hears yelling coming from the mess hall. he turns to head back at a run.
As he enters the mess hall he sees what has happened his friends have someone pined to the ground. He looks over and sees Arty laying on the floor and one of the not moving. Rushing to her side he sees the new medic tending to her. "What happened, is there anyway I can help?"

Antur stares at Jax for a moment anger flaring in his eyes. Then the realization hits home, Arty might die! Tears forming in his eyes Antur looks to Jake his trusted wingman "Take care of this."
Antur gets up allowing Jax nd Jake to take over. Then rushes over to Arty`s side "What can I do?"

"I need you to lay back down for me, we're gonna get you over to medical once I'm sure your ok enough to move.." Daxxon looks up at Antur "I need to get her on the stretcher but she will be fine, I promise." Daxxon unloads the Hover Stretcher and puts it to the Young Females Side and Looks at her "Listen we are gonna load you on here but I need you to stay still, can you tell me your name?" Daxxon Nods over to Antur to help him load her onto the Stretcher.

Antur nods to the new comer providing medical care to Arty. Then reaches down to help carry Arty to the stretcher "Donâ€™t worry I got you Arty, you did not think I would let you out of our date that easy did you?" Antur lets a half hearted chuckle out though it was obvious he was not in a cheerful mood.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-09-25 15:52:09)

Arty was dazed, there were voices talking...well..she thought they were voices, that had to be what the buzzing sound was right? She turns slightly to the nearest buzz, letting it push her back down; what was it asking? ..still...lay...still. Ok...she could do that, she was tired anyway..when did she get so tired. Her head moves again to the other side, Antur..her hand moves to his cheek, her breath irregular as her body tried to figure out how to do it properly. Antur..she was so happy to see him, he wasn't there in the place she was before...before her chest hurt..her chest hurt..why did it hurt? doesn't matter, "Antur.." she says softly.
Another buzz, what'd it say? she turns to it, trying to read the lips..blurry..hehe..who has blurry lips?

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Yogi** (2008-09-25 16:21:27)

Antur looked at him anger and worry in his eyes, "Take care of this." And his friend let go of the man who was starting to foam at the mouth.
Jake looked at Jax. "This isn't good look at him lets get him on his side so he doesn't choke on it." Jake rolls the man over to his side while keeping pressure on the man to keep him pinned with the Captains help. He raised his voice over the quiet mess hall. "I'm going to need another medic over here!"

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Frost** (2008-09-25 16:28:45)

Jax places the blaster to the man's head. You see a look in the captains eye that disturbs you.
"He isn't gonna need a medic. He is gonna need a coroner. "
Jax lets go of the man with his other hand and places the hand in front of his own face to block the splatter.
Daxxon and Antur lift Arty onto the hover stretcher.

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Yogi** (2008-09-25 16:52:41)

Jake looks at the Captain with a surprised look on his face. The look fades quickly as he can understand how Jax feels for Arty. He's like a father to her. But something about this guy wasn't right.
"Captain Something isn't right here. Believe me I want payback also but look at him." Jake grabs the man by the chin and pulls the mans face so its looking at Jax.
"Look. Look at his face, his eyes, the foam coming from his mouth. I have enough medical training to know that this isn't natural. Maybe he can be questioned so we can have some answers for this unexpected attack." He looked into the Captains eyes looking for any sign if he was reaching him. "If you kill him will never know what prompted all this."

"Jax, you can kill him but the Autopsy will take longer and you will never feel any better about this either way.." Daxxon says looking towards Jax poitning the gun at the Shooters Head, with no emotion in his face as he said it "But if it is a toxin of any sort in his bloodstream, you may end up killing everyone in here as well.". Daxxon nods at Antur as he activates the Hover System on the Stretcher as he gets it up to his midsection to push it he sighs and says "But it is your choice, make the one you can live with." Daxxon begins to cart her toward the Door "Someone mind showing me and our patient and possible prisoner to the Medical Bay?"

### **Frost** (2008-09-25 17:13:24)

Jax growls under his breath the swipes the pistol across the shooter's jaw with a solid crack knocking him out.
"Get this Hutt slime outta my sight. Get him to med bay and restrain him in quarantine."
The ships medics and security have arrived on the scene as well. Jax deals with security as the medic get briefed by Daxxon. Both Arty and the shooter are taken to medbay.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-25 18:04:37)

Antur points to the Gungan as he helps Arty to the med bay "You owe her big time!" With that Antur stays by Arty`s side helping with the stretcher escorting her to the med bay.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-25 18:52:05)

The Gungan shrugs his shoulders out of pure sadness. His ears hung very low, and his eye stalks sagged a bit. "Mesa not 'spect dis happenin. Da guungun shaker do nothing! Grabbin dat birdie was a bad move, de paster is becoming de pasted!" Mar San walks to a chair and has a seat, trying to stay out of the way of the medical process. *Some of you may not understand what the Gungan is saying if you don't speak Gunganese.*

Daxxon finishes briefing the Medical Team on Arty's condition, assuming that was her name from what he heard from Antur call her and suggests a full toxicology screening of the shooter, along with a mental evaluation as he heads to Med Bay with them. Daxxon walks in with them to the Med Bay and looks over at Antur "Like I said, bravery and stupidity can get people killed with nothing to show for it, but when someone sacrafices there life for something you can at least treat that something or someone with respect." Daxxon restocks his Medkit and gets the Stretcher folded back up then looks back at Antur "Incase your dense in the head, I mean you should apologize to the Gungan while your girl Arty heals." Daxxon heads over to the the Medics getting ready to assist with treatment and the skin graffing.

*Moving?* they were moving? *ugh..more buzzing..where did they learn to speak? Wait..where was Antur??*  her eyes move around trying to find the pilot, relaxing when she sees him come to her side; her eyes don't leave him, even spending that eternity in fuzzy thing she was at was torture without him. She couldn't see him didn't even know if he was ok but now he was here and she felt better. She manages a small smile to him mumbling out his name again before she arrived at the medbay.

After leaving the bar, Jordan continued to walk around randomly. He didnÂ´t really know why, he just felt like being alone for the moment. He didnÂ´t regret a single word of what he had said to the captain, and he would say them again in a heartbeat. He had half been expecting the pilots of Alpha squad to be waiting for them outside, but he had seen no one on his way out.
Not really sure where to go, he decided to head for the hangar, to check out the ship, maybe try and get some work done during the night.

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-26 06:17:19)

Antur glares at the doc "I am not in the mood for this! Fact is she saved the Gungans life, in anyone's book that's a debt pure and simple. Seeing how you did your best to save Arty I will forget the dense remark for now, its not wise to go around calling others stupid!" Like Antur said he was not in the mood to be corrected by some new guy, and hey someone saves your life you bet you owe how dense would one have to be not to see that.
Finished with that conversation Antur turns back to more important matters, Arty. Holding her hand the only thing Antur can think to say is "Your going to be ok." Over and over, to comfort her and convince himself at the same time. As they continue to the med bay Antur holds Arty`s hand.

The next few days are a whirlwind of activity. Arty recovers from her blaster wound in the bacta tank. An investigation ensues both squads are questioned. It was determined that Rocce (The shooter from alpha squad) was high on death sticks. He is in the brig waiting for a courts martial hearing. Jax has a standing order from higher ups that void and alpha stay away from each other as much as possible. Arty is being released from medbay and Jax has arranged a formal squad dinner. During this meal you will get to know your new squadmates.
There are two new squadron members 2nd Lt Biardi Vintos a duros pilot and 2nd Lt Daxxon Younge combat medic. The gungan (*ooc:Who still hasn't posted his character yet!*) has also been invited to join to celebrate Arty's recovery.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-26 11:53:18)

The last few days had been rough on Antur, sleeping in a chair within the med bay was not even a little comfortable. When Arty is released Antur stretches out his sore back and greets her with a strong embrace. Heading to the celebration dinner Antur greets his fellow squad mates pulls a chair out for Arty then takes a seat beside her.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-09-26 12:10:42)

Arty fluffs her hair a bit, waving to the medics "Thanks for everything everyone!" She grins happily to them before turning to the door, looking around for her dear pilot. It really hadn't been that bad of an experience, then again maybe that was just because Antur hadn't left her side. She hugs him tightly when he hugs her, taking his hand as they go to the formal dinner. She had been handed a formal uniform that they had somehow found under the mounts of books, clothes, mechanical parts and other things she had tried to kill the evil thing with without actually killing it.
She didn't really care for skirts, pants were just so much more comfortable. She'd even tried complaining about it when it was issued to her that it was sexist and she should have the option of pants. They still gave her the skirt. In this one case however, she didn't mind it would be the first time Antur got to see her in a skirt, granted the last time if she could help it but still, she didn't mind for him.
She smiles at her friends when they enter for the dinner, waving to the Captin when she spots with him with a bright smile on her lips. When the chair is pulled out for her she sits, though not before kissing Anturs cheek with a soft "thank you" in his ear.

Jake put on his dress uniform and ran his hands over it in several places to get the lint off of it. He certainly looked the part of a rebellion pilot/officer. The past few days made him want to hop into his snub fighter and take off more than ever. The questioning from the security forces and the orders to stay away from Alpha Squad have just dulled his senses. He just wanted to be where he was most happy. At the controls of whatever ship he could get his hands on.
He left for the dinner happy at least that Arty was doing well now. Arriving at the meeting place he entered and saw several of the others already sitting. With a purposeful stride he walked to the table and took a seat next to Jax. "How's everyone doing?" He ask with smile that was normally there.

Looking sharp in his dress uniform Biardi enters the dinning room with a slight smile. Heâ€™s eager to meet his new squad mates. Biardi nods to those already seated and makes for a chair close to them. â€œGreetings Captain, Ensigns, Iâ€™m Biardi Vintos. Looks like Iâ€™ll be joining the squadron.â€ With a pleasant expression on his face he offers his hand to the others before taking a seat.

Daxxon shows up in his semi-formal clothes, he never cared much for formal things, besides he was Mercenary, a Combat Medic at that who is use to having things bleed and spill on him. Daxxon wasn't dressed to the part of an officer, his Brown Leather jacket probably not helping the matter with his Combat Boots and Blacks Pants and his Green Shirt. Daxxon nods in a greeting way to Biardi Vintos, then take a seat at the far end away from most of the group.

Most of Deels time is spent in the hanger bay working on the Voidstalker. He finds it helps him forget about what has happened over the last few days. He makes sure everything is working and running even checking over the med bay to make sure that it is working for the new medic. He goes to his quarters to clean up and change into his dress uniform. He hates wearing this thing but but somethings can't be helped. As he arrives to the dinner he sees that Arty is out of the Med Bay and doing must better. He makes his way over to her and Antur. "Glad to see you are looking better Arty, XO has missed you but I have kepted him busy with repairs." He looks around the room seeing all his friends and the new member of the team talking and having fun. "It is good to see everyone have fun for a chance. There as been to much bad stuff happening as of late. Sorry I didn't visit that much Arty I have been busy with the repairs."

If Antur`s smile could widen it would, he does turn a brillant shade of red though. Trying to compose himself Antur realizes new squad members are present "Ah .... um .... well hello all.

Jake nodded at the two new comers. "Jake Golan welcome to the squadron. I'm the other sunb fighter jockey." He looks down the table to where Daxxon was sitting. "Come down and joins us Daxxon even though you aren't dressed as the Captain asked you can still sit with us. Like it or not you're part of the Void Stalkers. Just so you two FNG's know this is not a squardon that gets easy assignments. The furballs are fast and messy. Hold on to your seats men it's going to be one bumpy ride."
He leans back against the back of the chair. "I just hope they get us some new fighters to contend with those new Imp fighters."

Daxxon sighs and gets up, heading over closer to the others and has a seat. Daxxon puts his left elbow on the table and his hand to his chin "As long as I'm paid the assignments don't matter to me as long as I keep you all alive, if one of you dies I don't get paid and I always get paid, if that's any comfort to you all." Daxxon thinks about the fighter comment "I can't say I know anything about the fighters your talking about, but whatever you have seen of them you probably already know their strengths, which means you likely noticed a weakness."

Biardi chuckles at the Human coupleâ€™s antics and the Twiâ€™lekâ€™s comment. â€œGood to meet you all. I suppose you can group me in with the other fighter jockeys, but *Iâ€™ll* try not to break anything that isnâ€™t Imperial,â€ he grins to let the others know heâ€™s just joking. However his mood darkens slightly at the medicâ€™s statement. A slight frown creeps onto his face, heâ€™s not sure how to take Daxx, but he nods in greeting to the man all the same. Looking at Jake, Biardi forgets all about the cynical comments, â€œWhat do you know about the new Imp ships? All Iâ€™ve heard is scuttlebutt.â€ The Duros could talk shop all day, despite the festivities.

Antur takes interest in the self proclaimed pilot Biardi. "Well they are fast agile they did not look like they could take a lot, but slag they swarm you hard. Its almost like messing with a snag pit on Reilyn four. I did not get to engage them in a snub though and I am a itching a little to get that going a little pay back." Antur reaches for a refill on his drink and offers Arty a top up on her drink. Whispering to Arty "Medical garb is one thing but you look great in a skirt." Antur throws her a sly wink of his own.

---

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **zerah** (2008-09-26 18:43:50)

Arty blushes, taking the top off to her drink with thanks. She listens to the conversations as she waits for the pilot to sit back down beside her. Once he does she picks up her glass to take a sip, making sure she kept her features as straight as she could while whispering to him "I could think of a few better things than a skirt." Taking a sip of her drink after and joining the conversation "They weren't like anything I've seen before, fast and agile, we barely got away." oh..she was enjoying teasing Antur very much, though she had an odd feeling she'd be paying for it at somepoint, strangely that thought didn't bother her in the least.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

### **Valheru** (2008-09-26 18:58:40)

Biardi nods, taking in everything they say about the new fighters. He replies "Don't worry Antur, I'm sure we'll get the chance soon enough. And when we do, they'll be the ones running," his voice a mixture of comedic bravado and seriousness.

Daxxon grins at Biardi's bravado "Well if your all as good as you are cocky then real soon the Imperials will rather play fetch with Hungry Rancor's." Daxxon wasn't here for there crusade for right and wrong, but he respected them for they're ambition and courage. He looks towards Deel whom he met in Med Bay constantly checking the Equipment for him "Deel if you want I could install you a Cybernetic Eye and have it be able to access your Datapad if you like, since you seem to always have that thing in your hand anyways." Daxxon sips his drink and puts it down "But I do appreciate the thorough work and check ups of my Equipment."

"Sorry, I just like to make sure thing are running and ready at moments notice." Deel looks alittle embrasused and puts away his data pad. "I would like to get ahold of the data we collected from those new fighters. If I could study it I might be able to figure out what they are capable of. Maybe then figure out what we need to take them down." Taking a drink of his furit juice and thinking abit. "The Y-wings we have now are not fast enuff to take them on. Maybe with some modifacations they might be, but it will take time to figure out."

The Gungan appears after everyone had already gathered. It would seem that he is a bit "late".
He looks around as if he is confused, and then he spots Arty. The purple amphibian perks up with his long ears and shoulders and walks to her. "Hello daree birdie! You saved my from bein pasted. Mesaaa be placing a life play on you hissen. By demand of the guds and Oma Oma, I am yousa servant till I'm goop. Not bein una, duey, or dee." The Gungan says this while counting, trying to express the years of his life debt. "But for mui and mui until my dead. We even besa palos for many days? Even though my days of shaken shaken in de galaxy will be gone, mesa is not a fraidee frog of de life play." Mar San had obviously pledged a life debt to Arty, and that he would follow her forever. He also expressed he is giving up his dreams as a dancer to honor the life debt because it is demanded by his Gods.

Arty blinks at the gungan, then looks to Antur and the Captin then back again. "A life debt?? well...I don't know about being a servant but..a friend is a wonderful thing to have. And I like your dancing! you know..." she pauses in thought and looks to Antur and the Captin a twinkle in her eye as she looks back to the gungan "what skills do you have my friend?"

The Gungan responds to Arty's question. "Yousa might be spakeing in frogee tongue. Neverminding, My good at jaw flappin, shaken for moolah, and grabbin da movahs and hangin' on! Mesa bombadest shaken fin flipper in da known galaxy. Una moment and yousa see!"
The Gungan demonstrates a ridiculous dance flourish by kneeling over and flopping his head out around in circles, his long ears slapping his head. He moves his arms around a bit, then freezes, sticking his tongue out and making a gurgling sound. He bows as if he had fans.

Biardi looks as though heâ€™s about to ask a question, probably about the Imp ships, but gets distracted by the Gungan. He isnâ€™t exactly sure whatâ€™s going on so he just watches in bemusement at how the others handle this newcomerâ€™s announcement. He glances at Deel, â€œThings always this interesting around you guys?â€.

Daxxon looks at the Gungan and speaks to him Gunganese [hide]Whats your name again friend and which Gungan city are you from?[/hide] Daxxon hasn't spoken the Gungan Language in awhile but he assumes it's still good enough for him to understand, then looking at Arty "If you have a hard time understanding him, I will clear it up for you the best I can but they're Language is kinda of hard to get use too."

Arty glances to the the medic with a raised brow "you're accent is a little rough but otherwise you did quite well." she gives him a smug look "Captin doesn't keep me around just because I can sneak past anything. I'm quite good with language."
She looks back to the gungan "Well, maybe you can hitch along with us hm? Earn more reputation on other planets?"

Daxxon look back at the Gungan again "Would you sit already, your pretty much part of this dysfunctional family now so you might as well eat too before Dear Old Father Jax comes and tells us our bedtime story." Daxxon pulls out a seat next to him for the Gungan

She grins at Jake and chuckles "I can't help it, they just follow me!" she looks to Jax "I can keep him right?" a look to Antur "please?" both getting her best cute eyes.

Jax has been sitting at the head of the table listening. Now he stands up and moves away from the table. He stands at attention.
"Attention on deck."
Everyone hops up and stands at attention as Garn Bel Iblis enters the dining room.
Jax salutes him and he returns it.
"At ease." Admiral Bel Iblis says
"So I understand we have some promotions to take care of. Will Ensigns Cage, Pyuuma, Revv, Golan, Olan, and Fol please come forward."
Jax stands next to the Admiral holding new rank insignia and datapads.
"For service and dedication above and beyond the call of duty it is my proud duty to promote these ensigns to the rank of Sub-Lieutenant effective immediately with all the rank and rights befitting thier new station."
He proceeds to call the six of you up individually and Jax removes your old rank then the Admiral pins the new ones on you and shakes your hands.
After the ceremony he thanks you all and then leaves.
Jax pours everyone a glass of wine and proposes a toast.
"To new friends and ones who can no longer be with us..and to Zim."

Arty stood proudly as she got her new rank, giving the captin a hug when he took her old rank before standing again at attention for her new one. Looking over to the others as they got theirs waiting for Antur to finish before kissing him happily and a soft whisper of "We should celebrate later." She congratulates the others and lifts her glass for the toast.

Biardi nods at the Gungan, â€œDaxx is right, have a seat. Looks like Iâ€™m no longer the newest member of this little operation, welcome.â€ He finishes the statement with a friendly grin for the Gungan.
Biardi jumps to attention when the Senator arrives and remains at parade rest during the ceremony. After itâ€™s over he joins in the Captainâ€™s toast, â€œHear, hear. Congratulations *lieutenants*!â€.

## Re: Shopping Spree or the Art of Aquisition

Antur accepts the promotion with a salute. "Thank you sir." Still unable to string together everything the Gungan has been saying he just smiles and nods. Turning to Arty as she makes her own proposal "That`s affirmative." Antur returns her kiss "We will differently have to celebrated this, what did you have in mind?" Antur whispers back.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-27 12:28:16)

Jordan had never really understood peoples fascination with titles and ranks. Sure, a good command structure helped ease things along, but being promoted didnÂ´t change him in any way, and receiving a small symbol didnÂ´t make him a better warrior. The only thing he needed to know what he is, is the tatoo in the shape of a mythosaur skull on his shoulder. Still, it was a joyus occasion, and he was happy that the others apparently found more value in it than him.
"Thank you sir"
Something that did affect him though was the fact that Bel Iblis himself expressed his appreciation over their work.
As the dinner began, he sat down and atÃ©, talking and cheering with his friends. And of course, sent a thought to those no longer among them.

Arty grins, thinking with a hum then whispers back to him "how about we start with some champaine later and see where we go from there hm?" She chuckles softly and pulls him to the table to take a seat. Happily she eats, she wasn't big on steak but really she wasn't about to say otherwise, it was always a treat now and then.

Daxxon quickly finishes off the Corellian Chowder Soup and finishes about 3 Quarters of his Nerf Steak and takes a Big Pull from his Drink. Daxxon loves these sort of jobs where not only does he get paid but gets a great meal, at least for the first nights. After awhile he decides to skip dessert and slowly starts to get up, avoiding drawing attention and walks over to Jax speaking low enough for the other not to hear "I appreciate the Meal Jax, but remember you are paying me, quite well I might add, but as soon as the Jobs done or you can't pay anymore I am gone so don't get to attached." Daxxon then sighs "So what time is the briefing?" he says to Jax

Jax grins at the young medic and pats him on the back.
"Yea you have pointed out the fact your a mercenary several times now, I think we get it. Briefing is tomorrow at 0900 hours. Have you been issued a room yet?"
He turns to the group
"Briefings at 0900 tomorrow so don't get too drunk tonight."

Daxxon grins "Don't want any of you getting attached is all...besides I'm not here for the same reason as you all are." Daxxon walks to head back to Med Bay, where he had been mostly been staying figuring he could keep himself busy anyways, as he walk out the door he says "Besides I could care less about your crusade for justice." Daxxon walks down the hall towards Med Bay but think to himself ~No matter how many times I say I don't care, I still do...but I can't show weakness..it's not allowed...not if I want to survive..~ Daxxon starts to have his fears and memory pour in but he punches his hand into the door frame of the Med Bay to recollect himself then heads in to wrap his hand for the night.

### **Valheru** (2008-09-27 14:21:45)

Despite his slender frame Biardi manages to finish both the chowder and his steak. He's learned to make the most of good food when it's available, especially in the military. The Duros gives the self-proclaimed mercenary a polite "Good Night" even though the man's cavalier attitude annoys him. Biardi thinks to himself, 'Why does he feel the need to constantly remind us he's only here for the money?'. With a mental shrug he decides now is not the time to concern himself with such thoughts and returns to the party. After everyone finishes Jake's round of drinks Biardi makes his way to the bar and shows the bartender how to concoct a popular Durosian shooter (OOC: or where ever we're getting our drinks from). He comes back to the table with a tray full of glasses, "This, my friends, is called a Broken Hydrospanner. Enjoy!". While aware that they likely have different tastes then him he's fairly certain they'll approve.
At the mention of a briefing Biardi perks up. He didn't want to intrude on the festivities but he's very eager to begin some actual work with his new squad mates. After socializing for a little longer he excuses himself, "Well, you heard the Commander. I'd better hit the sack if I'm going to make it to the briefing on time. Great to meet you all and I look forward to flying with you." With that he makes his way back to his bunk and crashes for the night.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-27 14:59:38)

As the mercenary leaves them, Jordans says in a lowered voice:
"Seems like staying unattached wonÂ´t be a problem"
He finishes his drink, and takes a sip of the new one that the duros offered. He finds it a little to sout for his taste, but otherwise quite ok. As his heavy bodyframe tends to keep him from getting too intoxicated, he remains seated, talking and laughing with his friends.

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-27 17:19:16)

The Gungan looked around quizzically at the statements about a mission. However, he didn't pay attention to anything when the food arrived. The amphibian ate similar to a Rancor that wouldn't even understand the concept of table manners. He didn't even bother using utensils, he simply shot his tongue out when he was ready to eat a portion. It was obvious the Gungan had become completely lackadaisical towards any mission. He certainly did not possess anything remotely similar to military bearing.

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-28 05:32:33)

Amongst all the members present Meeto was the most reserved and quiet, he accepted his new rank with humility and wasn't sure he was ready for advancement. He kept to himself, but was extremely happy to see Zim and Arty both healthy, laughing and conversing. He hadn't made any opinions about the new members except the Gungan. No personal should be on the ship without some experience or useful skills to aid in the operations on Void Stalker. Dancing wasn't exactly a military skill, and he couldn't even understand the words coming out of his mouth. Communication was extremely important on missions, especially when lives were at risk. He didn't like the idea of bringing any of this baggage on Void Stalker.
Meeto never drank any alcoholic drinks, he kept to his fizzy sweet colas. The Rodian wasn't being rude, he just didn't drink. There was something on his mind that kept him distant from the festivities. He had been in the ships computers for days now trying to recover all active sensor readings, turrets targeting readouts and passive scanner readings that were damaged in the battle. With the attack pattern's recorded and Void Stalkers targeting system's log damage Meeto started to create a clearer picture by filling in the blanks with new binary code. His mind was in calculations during the dinner, and his food was barely touched because of is lack of attention to the present.
((OOC: All Meeto has been doing for the past days is working on the ships computers and extracting data, he wants to form a package of data that he can give to Deel and Jax that might be useful))

Nice the full treatment which is a lot for the rebellion to provide in hard times like this, we must have gotten someones attention. Antur takes a healthy portion of steak and drink at the dinner. Not sure about the new members Antur takes a drink with them anyway, though he is curious about the new pilot. Antur smiles at Arty when the cap advises not to drink too much and whispers "0900 is that enough time for us to celebrate?"

Arty had tried to finish the dinner, but it was just too much for her. Only finishing half of the steak she takes a sip of her drink and grins over to her pilot "Hmm..might be close but I think we can manage don't you?" She gives him a wink and chuckles again looking around to the others while she waited for a good sign to steal Antur away.

He looks at his datapad every so often to see if there is any updates on the finishing touches on there ships.

Meeto excuses himself and moves back on board the ship to do more work. He lived on VS1 even though he had corridors he was getting accustomed to sleeping on VS1 rather than in his more comfortable quarters. He opens the portable computer and hooks up the external peripherals to the ship for readouts. He beckons XO to assist him in his work. You can find Meeto on the bridge of VS1 re-wiring and trying to makes sense of computer read outs. He has patched the portable computer to all visual panels and is using them as monitors for his work.
Meeto has stayed up all night late again lost in his work. He knew he would regret this in the morning, and he wouldn't be to alert for the mission briefing.

Arty glances back to the gungan and chuckles "Why don't you get some sleep in your own quarters tonight ok?" She would have said more but was distracted by the hand to her hair, all other thought leaving her as her heart skipped a beat. She smiles to him "My quarters sound fine..though it seems we forgot the drinks." she smiles at him, the drinks really weren't that important.
