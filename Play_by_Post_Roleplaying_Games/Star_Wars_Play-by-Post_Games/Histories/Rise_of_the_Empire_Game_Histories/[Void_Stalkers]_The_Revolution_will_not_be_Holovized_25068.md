# [Void Stalkers] The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **Frost** (2011-07-10 22:37:15)

***Location: Mos Eisley Cantina.***
After the battle at the Taraxis shipyards your lives have been comprised mostly of running and fighting as the Empire closes in. The Alliance had no choice but to shatter itself into a thousand pieces and scatter. Your last communication from Jax at High Command was to get away and start rebuilding. The Alliance would need weapons, supplies, locations for bases, starships and vehicles, as well as the most important thing of all Volunteers. Which is why your in the ass end of the galaxy know as the Arkansis Sector.<div style="text-align: center;">
![675px-MosEisley-BFRS.jpg](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080724224830/starwars/images/thumb/2/21/MosEisley-BFRS.jpg/675px-MosEisley-BFRS.jpg)
</div>

Tatooine is miserable planet. You have been on planet for less that three standard hours and it feels like you have sand everywhere. Jax said your newest member would be here at Mos Eisley. The place is called the armpit of the galaxy and you now believe you know why. Your not sure what smells worse the Batha dung everywhere or the Jawas. Criminals walk openly through the streets and poverty runs rampant. You have made your way through the street safely because most of the riff raff are to scared to mess with a Barabel and a Mandolorian. The cantina near the spaceport is packed as you enter and make your way to the back. Jax said your new medical officer would meet you here and you would know him when you saw him.<div style="text-align: center;">

Arty had taken her seat at her new favorite booth, the once happy go lucky and rather airy woman had been quieter of late since the last mission. Loss of antur had hit her hard, and the 'loss' of Jax wasn't helping her moods. It was just a matter of time though before she was able to put things behind her, locked away so she didn't have to think about them daily.
For now, her role in this was to survey the area, and help try and find the medic for their new group. She was leaning back, a glass of untouched whiskey within her fingers, face schooled into a mask of mixed indifference and cool disregard; the others were the muscle and the danger, for all anyone knew she could just be the brains or dangerous as them.
Let people think what they liked.
"Know him when we see him, he says" she mutters faintly to her companions, shifting her posture to a more relaxed slouch, leg half crossed over the other and blaster clearly displayed, her fingers encircle the glass as she scans the crowd discretely again "you'd think he could be less helpful than that."

Kro-sa squeezes his frame in next to Arty, enjoying the warmth of the planet. It was too dry for him, but the temperature was just right. He ordered the most expensive thing on the menu- plain water, and enjoyed every drop. Alcohol didn't do him much good, it made him dangerously unpredictable for a short time before he metabolized it, and the water tasted better. He had learned more in the last few weeks than he had in his entire life on Barab 1, and thoroughly loved his new work. He didn't care for the cantina though, it stank. Badly. The fights were fun though. Jordan had said not to kill anyone unless necessary, so it had helped him learn to hold back a bit.
Slightly bored and with no idea how they should know the new team member, he hunches forward in the booth both elbows on the table. He turns and gives Arty his biggest goofiest grin for no apparent reason, hoping to draw her out of her recent funk.

Arty's gaze flickers to the body of scales that squeezes beside her..and his drink of choice. honestly he was going to blow more of his credits on that than anything else...a real shame considering the few glances he had given some of the weapons they'd passed in their short time.
She wasn't going to blow her money, no, not at all...well...maybe a little. There were a few parts for droids she'd spied. Now if their medic would only show then they could go do a bit of shopping.
The goofy grin on the lizard had her lips quirking up in a faint laugh, eyes brightening to something of her old self, and out of the character she was trying to portray. She hides it behind her glass, sipping the hard drink slowly; attempting to hide the wince, oh she hated whiskey, but it was cheap and looked better than some other drink. "Stop that." she admonishes, that twinkle still in her eye before it's hidden or smothered away "I'm trying to work here." she says offering a grin before it's schooled back into her mask.
"Where the hell is that new guy."

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **Magical2099** (2011-07-12 00:45:30)

Kro-sa's exaggerated grin wilts into a more exaggerated frown before he turns his shoulders towards her, blocking most of the cantina from seeing his face, and sticks his tongue out at her, and expression he learned watching the urchins in this city. He turns back to the cantina with a small smile and one of his chuckles (a series of of short hisses) escaping him. He didn't understand humans. Arty, for example, was older than him by a few years, but still tiny. He crooks a claw at the server, when it arrives he orders, **"More wadder, and bring foodzzsss pleassse. Bring exsstra for ssssmall hoo-man."** The others in the group had tried to explain a simple carbohydrate and protein intake increase wouldn't make her bigger but he still didn't quite get it.
He took the time to look around the cantina, looking for his usual sparring partners and other threats. The local drunkards were okay, at least as far as not holding grudges. While he did so he wondered about the other differences between humans and Barabels. He understood mourning, but Arty had seemed preoccupied and troubled for a while now. Everything in his new life was so different from his home.

The heat was only bearable because of his hand written genetic code. Kaminoan's had built in an endurance to help with this kind of thing. Tatooine's heat was some of the worst in the known galaxy so a little discomfort should be expected. When he cloned himslef next he would have to modify that, or at least he would if he ever had another chance to clone. The restrictions on non military controlled cloning were very sever. Kamino's cloning facilities had been decimated at the end of the clone wars and Toren knew why. His thoughts returned to the present and his current location. Toren-Ve's large eyes scanned the cantina his long neck giving him a higher field of view. He was familiar with most of the species here at least on a genetic level. The Barabel was the easiest to spot as human's always seemed to look alike on the surface. He made his way towards it with a swaying walk.
**"Greeting Sentients I believe we may have an appointment. I am Dr. Toren-Ve I just need a small DNA sample to confirm the diagnosis then I can take you for the treatment."**
All this secrecy and such where not his strong suit. He was fairly confident these where the contacts Commander Jax had sent him to join but the DNA comparison would soon confirm his logical conclusion.

### **zerah** (2011-07-12 07:42:16)

Arty sighs faintly, very nearly slapping her face with her hand at the Barabel **"Kro how many times do we have to go over this? I'm not that small!"** she sighs, kicking the seat in front of her in a faint tantrum, so childish.
"Greeting Sentients" What the hell? She looks up, and up, and up a bit more to blink at the odd alien before them, well...now she knew why Jax said they'd know him when they saw him.
"I believe we may have an appointment. I am Dr. Toren-Ve I just need a small DNA sample-"
DNwhatnow?
**"Ohhh no."** she states, ignoring the rest of the alien...Doctors statment "no thanks." she says and motions to the seat **"you're the first one brave or stupid enough to come by this table that wasn't paid to do so, sit down."** She orders, nodding to the seat before her and beside the others.
In a lower tone she adds **"You've found us."** pushing the glass she'd been playing with away from her she watches the doctor, tall for sure, long neck was probably a weakness in a fight, didn't look like much of a fighter, then again what medic was. Her gaze narrows as she studies him like an interesting insect upon a slide.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-12 08:08:44)

Seated with his eyes overlooking the wider area of the cantina in front of him, Jordan Revv paid only minor attention to what his two companions were doing. It seemed like Kro-Sa was trying to cheer Arty up somehow, and he was content to let the Barabel do just that. The last months hadn´t been easy on any of them, and being stuck in this hell-hole could bring anyone down, even if they were in a good mood to start with.
He took a moment to consider the odd trio that they were. A Mandalorian veteran of too many battles, a Barabel still struggling to adjust to life away form his own kin, and Arty who was currently running on half speed, still missing Antur, he supposed. It wasn´t that he didn´t miss the friends he had made since signing up with the Voidstalkers, but it also wasn´t the first time he had lost companions. And with Garm Bel Iblis recently going MIA, presumed dead, he didn´t expect it to be the last time either. Still, with the role of commander now thrust upon him, he´d do what he could to make sure the next one to go would be a long way from now.
He thought about what Jax had said, that they would know the new medic when they saw him. Jordan had figured as much, as anyone in the medical profession would be in possession of some intelligence, which would immediately make them stick out in a place like this. But when he saw the creature enter the cantina, he knew what Jax had meant. Unlike many of his brothers might have, he didn´t reach for his pistol though, the only weapon he had brought with him to the cantina. He didn´t recognize this particular Kaminoan, but when he approached them and spoke, a wave of familiarity washed over him.
Waving a hand in support of what Arty had just said, and to offer a seat, he looked at the being who would turn their trio into a quartet.
**"You´re a long way from home, *Kaminiise*, and in a place where mind don´t matter as much as muscle. It´s dangerous to be walking around alone"**

Kro-sa's shoulders and chest swell as the being speaks, then quickly return to normal. *DNA test? What is this DNA?* he wonders, then Jordan and Arty's responses show him to be the new team member. Kro-sa relaxes, and contents himself with looking at the newcomer. *So many different kinds. How can it be so tall and so skinny at the same time?* he thinks before looking around for the server and his food. He stretches, the shipsuit stretching with him, pulling tight over the canisters and grenades in its many pockets. His beaten, old utility belt drapes heavily to one side, weighed down by the grenade launcher hanging from it. The launcher is less than a meter long, with a smooth wooden grip and a wooden fore-end. On his massive frame it looks like a large pistol.

### **DarthTardis** (2011-07-12 20:34:59)

**"There are not many places safe in the galaxy for my kind anymore.'**
The Kaminoan slides in next to the small human keeping her inbetween himself and the Barbarel. He pulls out a small scanner and holds it out.
**"I was told to compare the DNA signatures to the ones on file to ensure I was with the right group. Plus if I am to be at my best medically a current DNA status would be most useful."**
He demonstrated how it works by placing his long finger on the pad. The scanner pulls up a current bioscan and status reading of himself.
**"I assure you it won't hurt and it will make keeping you alive and cloning replacement parts much easier."**
He tries to give an encouraging facial gesture.

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **zerah** (2011-07-12 21:03:53)

Arty frowned, eyes narrowing, she brushes a stray dark blue lock from her face "I'm not giving you a sample." she states again.
Her lips pull farther into a frown as she contemplates it, then again...if he had been with them before..antur would have done it...and he'd be able to be cloned from the information right? she could have had her antur back...Jax could be whole again..
Grumbling faintly she relinquishes her arms to place a finger on the scanner "I am not happy about this." she states. Then again she didn't see much else of a choice, he wasn't about to really tell them anything until he got the damn scans.
"Happy now? can we move on?"

---

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-13 07:08:50)

Watching Arty give the Kaminoan a DNA sample Jordan chuckles a bit, more at the way the alien phrased it than at Arty giving in.
**"Look, don´t get your hopes up about using cloning and gene technology to practice medicine while you hang with us. If something falls off, we saw it back on, and that´s it. But now that you´re here, perhaps we should move on. You seem to have a lot of stuff, so let´s get it back to the ship"**
((
DT, that was my subtle way of saying that your character is quite overloaded by all the gear he´s carrying.
))

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **Magical2099** (2011-07-13 10:39:21)

Kro-sa tries to be very gentle running a claw across the scanner, asking, **"What issss dissss D-N-A?"** When Jordan mentions excess gear he pipes in, **"Kro-sssa sssstrong. Kro-sssa can carry kit. Foodzzz not here yet dough,"** as he looks around for the server and his meal.

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **zerah** (2011-07-13 11:21:52)

Arty sighs faintly "DNA is the body's....information or something that, tells a person that can read the information all about the person, blood type, blood count, organs.." she waves her hand flippantly "That sorta thing. or something."
She grabs her glass and downs the shot in a single go, wincing as it burned on the way down, her eyes crossing at the taste; ugh she hated whiskey, why the hell did she get it again!?
attempting to school her face back into that mask she leans back into her chair "I'm all for getting out of here, sooner the better."

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **Magical2099** (2011-07-13 13:43:31)

**"D-N-A, sssoundsss neat. If Kro-sssa learned D-N-A he could tell what tassstess good before biting it? Ssssmall hoo-man mussst eat. Tall, din whaddeva sssentient isss mussst eat. Foodzz good for you. Besssidesss, Kro-sssa issss *hungry*,"** Kro-sa replies, flicking his tongue out at Arty again with another silly grin before getting up and going to the bar to get the food himself. He manages to scare the server so badly it drops the tray it's carrying, simply by giving it a hard look. He soon returns with a tray of food, pushing large portions towards Arty, then eating them himself when she pushes them back. Soon, all of his is gone, and he waits contentedly for the others to finish, ready for the leftovers and to leave.

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **zerah** (2011-07-13 15:40:02)

Arty watches the barabel and sighs at the plate before her. Her stomach turned at the sight, no...she was not in the least bit hungry, hadn't been really all that hungry lately but at the moment...ugh what in the hell did he order anyway?
She pokes the food with her finger for a moment, did it move? no she was not going to eat it now, that was for sure.
she pushes the plate away and shakes her head "Kro...I'm uh...not hungry." she manages still staring at the food like it might jump up and bite her.

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **DarthTardis** (2011-07-13 19:26:47)

With a satisfied nod he confirms a match. He saves the data for later and proceeds to examine the food that the Barabel no he should stop thinking of them by species. Kro-sa was his name and the female was Artimus. That made the Mandolorian Jordan Revv.
Not willing to eat the food Kro-sa brought with out decontamination procedures he can under stand Arty's reluctance. He was about 87% sure that "nerf' was actually womp rat or possily Jawa. He absent mindedly picks up a small piece for analysis later.
**"What is our next goal Jordan?"**
Turning his large eyes on Arty.
**"If you do not feel like consuming your nutrients in the normal fashion I can create a vitamin supplement tailored to your physiology."**

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **zerah** (2011-07-14 07:11:56)

Arty's eye twitched "I do not.need.a.supplement." she all but growls, would have if she had the vocal cords for it. Her temper was beginning to real it's ugly head, a few deep breathes force the mood swing she'd been prone too back from the surface.
"Are we leaving or what Jordan?" she finally asks, hoping to shift some attention back to their new commanding leader.

---

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-14 07:17:09)

Placing a hand on his seat, Jordan heaved himself upright and started to move out of the booth.
**"Well, now that we´re all assembled, I think we´ve all spent enough time in this plasma furnace, so I say we head back to the VS1 and get out of here"**
Turning to look at the newcomer, he smiled.
**"In fact, I´ve got a much more moist destination in mind. I don´t remember seeing you there, so I hope you haven´t done anything to get yourself exiled or anything. Let´s go. Kro-Sa, help the doctor with his stuff would you? Don´t whine about your food, as I know you´ll down it whole in a second if you have to"**
With that, the large man made his way out of the arena. His age may be starting to catch up with him, but he still presented a formidable enough frame that most would hesitate before troubling him. And of course, the dark tattoo of the mythosaur skull on his shoulder only added to that image, at least for those who recognized such a symbol.

Thankful to be getting out of the hell hole called a planet, Arty promptly gathered her legs under her before hopping onto the table and off, healed boots giving a soft tap as they hit the ground.
Adjusting her black vest and dusting off her pants, she brushes a clump of blonde, pink and blue from her face before following, one hand resting on her blaster for good measure as she followed the mandolorian out. "finally." she mutters with a thankful sigh.

### **Magical2099** (2011-07-14 19:39:03)

Kro-sa grabs the last plate and tilts it up over his open mouth, pouring the rest of the food in. He swallows and clicks his teeth as he grabs the medical kit and field kit, slinging them over a shoulder easily. He beckons to the new member with a claw as he moves to leave. **"Arty not alwayzzz sssso mean. Arty wounded. Not wounded here, or here, or here,"** he says, patting himself on the head, chest, and arm, **"But here,"** at last pointing to his stomach, just below the sternum, where a Barabel's heart is located, hoping the doctor understands the reference. **"Arty can't forget. Memory good for mossst wound, keep from hurting again, but not good for dis wound, ssssee?"** he says as he leads the Kaminoan out of the cantina, turning towards the docking bay and keeping an eye on his other allies. In the daylight, he looks up at his new ally and asks, **"What issss ssssentient?"**

---

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **DarthTardis** (2011-07-15 07:18:22)

As Kro-sa explains about Arty the Kaminoan nods in understanding. He may come from a race of cloners but he understands that most cultures view death as a final thing rather than a chance to start fresh. He glances down at the reading he just took from her and gives a slight shake of his head. It takes a moment before he realizes what else Kro-sa had asked.
His large black eyes blink for a moment and what might be a smile forms on his face. With a large intake of breath the scientist starts his lecture on what makes a Sentient. His melodic voice takes on an excited tone.
**"Sentience is the ability to feel, or perceive, or be conscious, or have subjective experiences. Bara-doon philosophers used the term to distinguish the ability to think ("reason") from the ability to feel ("sentience"). In modern Corellian philosophy, sentience is the ability to have sensations or experiences (known as "qualia"). For philosophy, sentience is a metaphysical quality of all things that requires respect and care. The term is central to the philosophy of animal and droid rights, because sentience implies the ability to suffer, which entails certain rights.
In the philosophy of consciousness, "sentience" can refer to the ability of any entity to have subjective perceptual experiences, or "qualia". This is distinct from other aspects of the mind and consciousness, such as creativity, intelligence, sapience, self-awareness, and intentionality (the ability to have thoughts that mean something or are "about" something). Sentience is a minimalistic way of defining "consciousness", which is otherwise commonly used to collectively describe sentience plus other characteristics of the mind.
Some philosopher believe that sentience will never be understood. They do not deny that most other aspects of consciousness are subject to scientific investigation but they argue that subjective experiences will never be explained; i.e., sentience is the only aspect of consciousness that can't be explained. Other philosophers (such as Daniel Dennett) disagree, arguing that all aspects of consciousness will eventually yield to scientific investigation…."**
He continues down this line of conversation as long as you let him.

In the open, sweltering hot air, of the planet Arty was following after Jordan; eyes and ears open for rouge thiefs, interesting tidbits of information, last minute shopping that might cheer her up (not like the others, there had to be something she could get to make her feel better).
Naturally in the open air it's a bit easier to hear each other speak than it was in the cantina. That was about why she tuned back into the conversation behind her about...something of scientific nature. going back over what her mind may have caught that she hadn't been paying attention to she rolls her eyes. "Sentience is a term used to define a being that can think Kro." she calls back over her shoulder "A crude way to determine a valuable life, if it thinks it's a crime in most cultures to kill it." she turns back around.
"You're sentient, I'm Sentient, Jordan's Sentient sometimes.." she grins wryly, a spark of her old humor returning at the simple joy of teasing the mando.

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-15 10:32:52)

When the Kaminoan threw himself into his lecture, Jordan just rolled his eyes, reminiscing about how it had been to be surrounded by the long-necked aliens. Then as Arty tried to simplify it for Kro-Sa - which seemed like a nice thing to do for the simple Barabel - he couldn´t help but chuckle at her finish. Without looking back, he smiled.
**"Sentient? Always. Sensitive? On occasion…an occupational hazard no doubt. Just wait until you´ve been in this game as long as I have, and tell me how you feel"**

The walk through Mos Eisley is hot but luckily not very long. Mos Eisley space port is run by the Jabba the Hutt much like the rest of the town. Your "docking fees" and "import taxes" are just outright bribes to Jabba himself but it keeps the ship safe and the fuel prices are fairly reasonable. The Voidstalker has looked better but that was back when she had full time loving maintenance by Deel. Now she looks like most of the ships in this sector a little battered and worse for wear. X0 lowers the ramp as you approach. Home sweet home.

### **zerah** (2011-07-15 16:27:03)

Arty jogs forward ahead of the mando at the sight of home, moving up the ramp quickly to make her way towards the cockpit, without antur, the thought made her cheek twitch, she'd been learning the piloting art, more than the vague bit she already knew. She was learning a lot thankfully, and X0's help made things a lot easier.
"Okay...lets see...start up sequence, need to find out where we're going from jordan.." she mumbles to herself as she runs through the checks and start ups to get them going.
Being in the cockpit and having something to occupy her mind allowed her a chance to both think, mourn, remember, and be alone. It was peaceful, made her feel close to her parents and to Antur, a blessing a curse really. Sighing, she shook her thoughts away to focus, wondering how long it'd take the mando and her faithful droid buddy to join her

### **Magical2099** (2011-07-15 17:50:59)

Kro-sa's eyes go cold and dead at the lecture from the newcomer and response from Arty. As they near the ship he says, **"Kro-sssa knows definition of ssssentient. Kro-sssa doessss not know what disss sentient,"** waving claws at the newcomer, **"issss. Kro-sssa not sssspeak Basssic good, Kro-sssa not ssstupid."** He leaves the conversation at that, dropping the newcomer's gear at the top of the ramp off to one side and moving deeper in, towards the technician's bay. Once there he breaks out his toolkit and proceeds with pre-flight checks of the repulsors, sub-light engines, hyperdrive, and maneuvering jets. *That misconception isn't something I haven't seen before,* Kro-sa thinks, in his native tongue, *Why do I let it bother me? Stupid, over-complicated Basic.*

Toren-Ve realizes he may have misunderstood the Barabel but isn't quiet sure how to rectify the mistake as Kro-sa storms off. His head droops a little in embarrassment as he grabs his gear and follows everyone on board. Not quiet sure where to go he looks to Jordan for advice.
**"Do you have a dedicated medical suite on board and where am I staying?"**

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-19 09:42:32)

**"Pick whatever quarter suits you. There are a few available. As for a medical suite, we don´t have one, but I´m sure you can find somewhere to do your work if you have to"**
Leaving the Kaminoan to work things out for himself, Jordan heads for the cockpit where he finds Arty already at work. Leaning at the doorway for a few moments, he watches her at work. Clearing his throat, he walks up to her and settles down beside her.
**"You ready to get out of here? Ready to start doing some serious hurt to the Empire?"**

The *Void Stalker* may have taken a beating recently but like the rest of you she has pulled through remarkably well. X0 and the rest of you have managed to get her back in the game and she is ready for action. She responds to Arty's commands like a race horse at the starting gate. Engine's flare and power thrumms through the ship. All system's are go.
X0 is working away in the workshop when Kro-Sa storms in muttering in his native language. His dome whirrs in a circle and he warbles a series of bleeps and bloops.
Toren-Ve wanders the ship and finds that the ship not only has a dedicated medical bay but a surgery suite as well. None of it has been used in long time and it isn't well stocked. It will need a good cleaning and some TLC but should be serviceable. He also finds a few four man rooms on the lower deck only one of the four rooms is unoccupied.

Arty glances back at the sound of a throat being cleared, blowing a few strands of hair from her eyes she nods with a faint grin "yes, please, lets get off this sweat hole." She watches him take his seat before turning back to the controls "Where we going anyway?" she asks as she sets to take off and get some space to leave the planet behind.

With a content sign Toren-Ve gets to work steralizing and stocking the shelves from his kit. He starts at the top and works his way down cleaning and doing any basic maintenece that needs to be done. After a few hours of work the medical bay is sparkling clean and while the equipment is older it is still serviable. Toren-Ve then heads to the lounge for some dinner and some relaxation. He munches the food cubes plopped out by the dispensors and skims the out dated titles in the entertainment system. Finding an old holo he hasn't had time to watch till now he sits back and enjoys the show.

All ssssysssdemsss nominal."** His report made he moves to the main hanger and dims the lights, digging his scrub-weed hammock out of storage and slinging it in the farthest darkest corner. He was most comfortable sleeping this way, it reminded him most of home. It had only taken him a week or so to make the hammock, and with the lights out in the main cargo area it became a cave. The engines' thrum was like the sound of the radiation storms from his home, and the large area had decent acoustics as well. He climbs his way into the hammock and drifts oft, swaying with the ship's movements.

**"To a place that is the opposite of this place in more ways than one. Kamino, the planet of storms, located in Wild Space. I believe we can find much of use there that can help us in our struggle. Be careful when we go in though, the place likely holds an Imperial garrison"**
In fact, he was almost certain it would, seeing as how the planet had looked when he left it. Even though it was remote and not very widely known, Palpatine would not have left Kamino unguarded. Still, Jordan hoped whatever forces were left behind would not prove too much for them to handle, and if they could manage to liberate Kamino, much could be gained.

Arty glances over to him as she heads for the outer atmosphere, setting up coordinates for a jump to Kamino. A frown crosses her lips "Why are we heading there? not that I'm not glad to get off the planet of sand and heat, but...why there?"
She had to admit, if imperials were there than that must be something good for them to want to hold the planet...but what would be important enough to warrant -them- going.

**"Well for one thing, the Kaminoans were among the first to rise against the Empire, even though they were solidly crushed that time. And second, I suspect they have information regarding the training and cloning of the empire´s stormtroopers, if cloned troopers are still being used.
Also, we might learn a bit or two about our newest recruit, things he wouldn´t tell us on his own"**

Arty chuckles faintly but nods her head "Sounds like a plan to me." she says, new information would be very welcome. She frowns "than again we haven't exactly asked him about himself now have we? It's a bit of a trip, might learn something from him, never know."
The call from the engine bay had her nodding "Alright, we're all set." she says.

After a few minutes of calculations Arty plots a course for Kamino. Once they are clear of Tatooine's gravitational anomalies, binary stars always play havoc with nav computers, your safely in hyperspace.

Arty sets the controls to auto with little attention from her save in the event of an emergency and turns to the mando, nodding her head back towards the door "what do you think of him?" she asks, leaning back into her seat, turning it a bit to cross her legs "I trust Jax but...haven't exactly picked up strays in a long time."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-27 18:15:55)

Turning his gaze out into the blue swirl of hyperspace, Jordan cracks a small smile as arty questions him about their newest crewmember.
**"He´s Kaminoan. Which means that in addition to whatever reasons he has for wanting to come along with us to fight the Empire, he probably considers this one big field trip. Don´t be alarmed if he starts to suggest ways to improve your genetic code, it´s what they do. Isolated in Wild Space, they perform their experiments, even on themselves"**
Giving out a small chuckle, he remembers days of walking on Kamino with the other *Cuy´val Dar* and the clones.
**"Did one good job with the army though. Of course, they had the best sample to clone them from"**

---

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **zerah** (2011-07-29 07:17:32)

Arty makes a face at the idea of the new member attempting to change her genetic code, or worse. The idea of their missions being a field trip to the Kaminoan was disturbing, would he even realize that their missions could be dangerous?
Shaking her thoughts from her head she turns her gaze back to the mando before her, curious "What was it like?" she asked faintly "being part of that I mean..." she looks confused then "wait what was the sample?"

**"In a way, it was every officers dream, being in an army of nothing but professionals, obeying and carrying out orders with nothing less than perfection. We didn´t have to teach them the basics, they already knew them, we just tried to impart what we had learned over the years ourselves, to give them the little extra edge they needed. I taught them how to blow things up, and when the war broke out, I took my boys into the field and brought hell to the CIS armies"**
Chuckling when Arty ask him about the clone sample, the veteran warrior points to the tatoo of the mythosaur skull on his right shoulder.
**"Not what, who. When they wanted an army of the best, they chose the best to create it. One hundred were called, all sons and daughters of Mandalore, to train the army. The army cloned from one man, a bounty hunter named Jango Fett, the man who held the title of *Mand'alor* at the time. He was the best of his time, much like his son is today…"**
Turning his gaze back into the blue swirl of hyperspace, Jordans face darkens a little at the thought of the younger Fett.

Hyperspace always made Toren a little uneasy. Something about being in a completely separate reality from the rest of the galaxy just caused his skin to crawl. Becoming bored with the holo and restless he decides to wander the ship and see what people are doing. He soon finds himself in the cockpit. He pauses at the entry way for a moment trying to determine if the Mandalorian and the female do not wish to be disturbed. Sensing a pause in their conversation he speaks
**"Am I intruding?"**

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **zerah** (2011-07-30 17:10:14)

Arty hung onto each word, she had a love of stories, childish as it was it was true, more so when they're true. This was fascinating, she eye'd the tattoo shown to her, memorizing the details but there was still more she wanted to know! why did his eyes darken when thinking about the son? was the title of Mand'alor exclusive? was it difficult to gain the title? did he ever hold the title? did he feel honor to teach the clone army? did he feel betrayed for the use it is now?
So many questions, and just as she shifted to the edge of her seat to start...
"Am I intruding?"
Her head hangs, so much for that.
Glancing over to the tall new member of their little band she debates with herself quickly, eyeing him before finally she sighs **"no…just talking about the past, and Kamino."**  She turns back to the mando before her, poking his arm. She wanted to ask him things still, but..that seemed private, she didn't know if he wanted those thoughts for others or not.
She turns back to the Kaminoan **"Bored?"**

His head bobs at Arty's question. Moving on to the bridge he takes a seat and swivels the chair away from the bright blue hyperspace tunnel outside the ships view ports.
**"Hyperspace always seems to elicit an emotional response most humans refer to as the "creeps". As a scientist it is hard to risk my life using technology based on theories and principles the galaxy doesn't even seem to completely understand."**
A small shudder seems to run down his long neck and his head fins flick slightly.

Arty snorts and covers her face in embarrassment of the sound, though it doesn't still her laughter completely. turning to gaze out at the blue of hyperspace she leans back and sighs "Hyperspace never gave me the willies, it was always a sense of freedom."
Turning her chair a bit to look over to them both she grins "but he's right though." she tilts her head as she looks him over "You know that neck of yours doesn't look very strong...maybe you should get some armor...or alter your genetic code to be more blaster resistant." she grins at the thought

**"Actually my neck is fairly resistant to breaking due to its serpentine nature. I think we actually tried the blaster resistant genome but it was too difficult with out completely restructuring epidermal layer. The agility that was lost was considered to great to out weigh the benefits."**
He pauses slightly as he finally realize that Arty was making a joke. His head fins ruffle as he chuckles.
**"Maybe I should work on the humor genome instead.**"
Turning to Jordan
**"What have you heard of Kamino since you were last there? From what I have heard Timira City was sunk by the Empire after they moved their cloning facilities."**

**"Haven´t heard much at all, been moving around too much. Though somehow I find it hard to believe the Empire would just abandon the place or destroy it.

### **zerah** (2011-08-05 07:45:53)

Leans back into her seat and frowns, the guy had no sense of humor...
Her frown deepens with the thought of the empire leaving a cloning facility alone. "I agree...especially when an army could be in need of replacements." She glances between them both "I wouldn't. I mean they'd still have the DNA in storage wouldn't they? and as we've seen, some people will do anything for a person in power or the belief that they'll be safe from harm." She shrugs "I'm with Jordan. As such we should consider the best way to get in shouldn't we?"

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **DarthTardis** (2011-08-06 00:13:37)

**"Palpatine didn't throw our skills away. He took those of us he thought were useful and put us into forced labor. When the Kaminoan's tried to resist the cloning facility on Timira was destroyed by Lord Vader which resulted in the sinking of the whole city."**
With a quick glance out the viewport that results in a shudder he continues.
**"Palpatine decided using only one genome was too much of a liabity. So he took what he wanted and destroyed the rest."**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-08-15 15:06:13)

**"That explains a bit about the decrease in performance I´ve noticed in the stormtroopers lately. Not like the army you guys produced"**
Jordan pondered what Arty had said for a while, stroking the beard stub covering his chin.
**"If we´re lucky, they won´t notice us coming in, but I wouldn´t count on it"**

The next few days flies by in a flurry of activity. The ship hasn't had any real maintenance since Deel's passing. The Kaminoan does medical evaluations and scans on everyone as well as basic psych evaluations on orders from high command. The ship flickers back into real space at the edge of the Kamino space.

Arty flicks auto pilot off and takes control, taking a moment to take in the beautiful blue planet in awe.
"Wow..." she whispers to herself, was the whole planet water? was that possible? no land mass? they must have artificial land than...that could be the only reason that the Kamino people wouldn't have webbed feet or something. She hums faintly, also explains why they had long necks, no land mass, likely only predators in the sea, no webbed feet and long necks, they had no natural enemy and evolution dictated it was unnecessary to shorten things.
She nods her head at her own analysis, granted not necessarily fact but hey, only so much she had to go on. "Makes sense." she comments on her own thoughts before flicking the coms on to the ship "Gentlemen we've arrived, make preparations and the like and what not." she lowers their speed to keep from getting noticed too soon "Jordan, when you're free come on up." She flicks the coms off and checks their sensors for any unwanted attention.

Shaking the sleep from his eyes, Jordan leaves the bunk he´d been sleeping on. Putting his shirt back on, he grabbed his comm from his belt. He´d been able to get at least a few hours of sleep after finishing looking the ship over, and was decently rested.
**"I´ll be up shortly. Kro-Sa, unless you´re doing something important, haul yourself over to the turret will you? Just in case we aren´t met with open arms"**
Replacing the comm in his belt, and getting the utility and holster belts in place, he headed for the cockpit. As he entered, he found Arty looking out the viewscreen, and settled down next to her.
**"It may look nice from up here, but once you get planetside, all that water will get to you. Trust me"**

Arty glances over at him as he speaks then back to the view "I don't really remember water. Not like that I mean, I think....I remember my parents and I had seen it once but it's hazy in my head."
She frowns faintly and leans back into her seat "I never learned how to swim..." she glances at him and grins "Don't let me drown yea?" she laughs and heads for orbit "So what's the plan? Backup story and all that jazz, say we have a kaminoan replacement on board?"

Kamino. It had been so long since he had been home. He hadn't really expected to ever return here especially while the Empire was still in power. A shudder ran down his long neck as he remembered his treatment at Imperial hands. He putters around medical for a few minutes making sure everything was in its place and ready before making his way to the bridge.
As he enters the bridge his breath gets caught in his throat as he stares out the view port at the watery planet hanging before him. After a slight pause he snaps out of it and finds a seat.
**"So what is our objective here?"**

Kro-sa hears his name over the ship's com and replies, **"Yesssss sssssssir!"** with a low growl as he puts down his tools and bolts for the laser cannons. His excitement is expected, the weapons on board being his favorite playthings in his new life. He climbs into the turret seat and scrabbles to find the headset, **"Power up now, or ssssshould Kro-ssssa waid?"** he asks.

**"To be honest, I´d be happy if we aren´t fired upon on sight. If you have some idea on what to say to make that happen, be my guest"**
Jordan smiles a bit, but he is in fact a bit concerned that they might very well be attacked on sight. As their newest crew addition enters the bridge and asks for their plan, he raises his shoulders.
**"Information gathering, primarily. We want to learn as much as possible about any continued work the Empire have been dong here, as well as where they have moved the projects that have been taken off-planet. Depending on the size of the garrison in place, it might be possible to start a riot as well, which would hopefully cause some setback to the Empire"**
He pulled up his comlink.
**"Keep the guns powered down until I give the order to power them up"**

Arty frowns faintly "Guess I'll be keeping a com on at all times hm?" she grins, being sneaky as she was it was usually her that went out to find inside information, she hadn't studied language just for nothing after all.
She frowns at the planet in the view screen "to get to land safely...or at least the hope of it, saying we have a new one for them might help, but the fact we don't have an imperial codes or identification might put a damper on that real fast.."
She glances up at the kaminonan and then the mando "Do they allow...I dunno, tourists?"

**"Tourists? Yes I believe so. Well we do have extravagant sport fishing opportunities as well as underwater exploration via submersibles and diving apparatus. Several extinct species of water based species have been cloned and released into the oceans."** 
His long finger tips drum together thoughtfully as he gazes at Kamino.

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **Frost** (2011-09-06 07:06:11)

Conversation dies away with an awkward silence to the Kaminioans reply about tourism. An hour or so later the *Voidstalker* is hailed by Planetary Control. A female voice pleasant but slightly cold sounding demands to know their reason for being here. The ships transponder is also pinged as they download your registry information.
All eyes turn involuntarily towards Jordan Revv the current mission commander. It was his idea to come here so they came.

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-09-09 19:42:37)

With all eyes turning on him, Jordan shrugs and waves a hand towards Arty, the other one keeping the comm disabled for a moment.
**"Go ahead, tell them whatever tale you had in mind. It´s the pilots job to respond to these things anyway. Our priority now is to get grounded safely, preferably without having a platoon of stormtroopers waiting on us as we exit"**

### **zerah** (2011-09-12 17:41:21)

Arty scowls at him, oh it would just figure he'd leave it to her to come up with some story to get them on the ground. And no troopers? the hell! did she look like she had all the answer??
Once again she wished antur was there, he was better at this then she was.
Offering a vague prayer to the stars she nods for him to release the com. If they said they had a kaminoan on board for transport they'd be swarmed with troopers...but tourists...those were harmless...more so if they were there for research on some of the endangered life forms that the alien had mentioned.
Crossing her fingers she takes a steadying breath "Yes we're a bit of tourists I suppose would be the proper term." she offers up some accent she'd heard once to try and make them seem like they'd come a longer distance "Though we're less here to take pictures of buildings more here to revel in the cloned life forms from eons ago, the idea of cloned animals from simple DNA is simply fascinating and offers a unique chance to update the books as they use to say!" she laughs and then launches into a very quick, excited ticking off of all the amazing things learning of an extinct species would benefit the universe. Maybe if she got lucky the woman would just get bored.

The traffic controller gives you a flight plan to Tipoca City, Kamino's capital city.
The city consists of a network of stilt structures that spans more than a hundred kilometers along Kamino's western equator and is considered by many to be the heart of Kaminoan society. Your flight plan takes you to one of the civilian docking platforms. As you land a few Kaminioans approach the ship walking gracefully through the driving rain. One seems a technician the other a bureaucrat. You do spot a few stormtroopers standing guard at the entrances to the city.

Arty breathes a sigh of relief once the com was off and they had been granted clearence. She grins to the others "Not too bad huh?" she asks, bringing the ship to land.
Her grin fades to a frown, "I spy troopers.." she says faintly, keeping the ramp up until they would leave. she frowns and looks over their kaminoan "They're gonna know somethings up by him...hm...could be our guide.."

Kro-sa's shoulders slump at the uneventful landing, and he crawls his way out of the turret heading towards the ramp. His spirits brighten as he thinks on the new planet he's about to experience. The amazing sights he's taken in are easily the highlight of his new work. He presses the ship's intercom near the ramp, asking his team, **"Carry weaponssss here legal or no?"**

---

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **DarthTardis** (2011-09-18 14:01:43)

Staring out the view port at the swirling oceans he almost missed the intercom traffic. With a slight jerky shake of his long neck he snaps out of his reverie and fingers the comm.
**"Weapon's restriction are probably set to Imperial standard operating procedure. So I would believe that weapons are probably prohibited."**
He grabs his satchel from the floor next to him and heads to the boarding ramp area. As he approaches and sees Kro-sa he give the large Barabel a nod of the head. It's was the Kaminoan's version of a handshake or friendly greeting.
**"I assume this is where our forged identa-chips get put to the test."**

Reaching the others at the ramp, Jordan checked the holster at his side to make sure it was secure.
**"Restrictions or not, we´re not going in empty. Leave the heavy stuff, but take your sidearms. There´s no saying that someone won´t recognize our new recruit or even me, and if that happens, we can´t count on it being a good thing"**
Hitting the controls to lower the ramp, the Mandalorian mercenary slowly walked down it, letting the sea breeze of Kamino sweep over him. It was good to be home.

Kro-sa pats the grenade launcher on his thigh and gives a grin in exchange for the nod from the tall being before his face takes a confused look, **"Idenda-chip? What issss disssss?"** he asks as he follows the Mandalorian down. He breathes deeply and immediately coughs violently at the salty air, spitting and hacking to clear his airways.

Arty sets the controls off and checks everything one last time before following after the others, checking her blaster she pauses and changes course to her room to replace her vest for her longer coat, moves the holister to her waist and hooks the jacket closed over it and her blaster. Smirking she rushes to the ramp, brushing stray hairs away from her face she all but skips down the ramp.
Breathing deeply she grins, then frowns, and sneezes. Wrinkling her nose she catches up to the others, resting her hands in the pockets of her pants "So shall we get going hm?"

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-09-23 08:34:49)

Grabbing hold of the Barabel as he descended from the ramp, Jordan pointed back into the ship.
**"I said sidearms, not heavy weaponry. We are just concerned about our personal security, not planning an invasion. Not obviously at least, so put it back"**
Not accepting any arguments, Jordan listened to the banter of Arty and their newest recruit while he waited for the Barabel to return his weapon. He chuckled a bit at the mention of their perceived insanity.
**"It may not be wise, but neither is getting caught by a stormtrooper patrol unarmed. And until you can prove that you are capable of beating our scaly friend in hand-to-hand combat, I´ll be expecting you to carry a sidearm at all times as well, understood?"**
The Mandalorian warrior looked around to see if anyone were coming to approach them. He may be pushing into his forties, but he wasn´t stupid. Of course they would be stopped somewhere for carrying arms visibly, but hopefully they could convince someone they weren´t here to cause trouble. He suspected that this place was the kind of garrison that was most for show (since few people even knew where Kamino was) and that people worked hard not to get assigned to. Such people were likely to be more lax in their routines, and could hopefully be made to just drop the issue, if they just made the effort to disarm them too much.

Kro-sa hangs his head and begins unstrapping the pistol-grip grenade launcher from his hip, **"But isssss sssside arm,"** he complains as he tosses it on the table inside the ramp. **"Not Kro-sssssa'ssss fault if weaponssss too big for odder beingssss."**
He lets his long legs take him quickly back down the ramp to join the others, cheered by the thought that the commander thought him capable enough to go without weaponry. He grins big at any stormtroopers, trying to appear friendly.

**"It´s a matter of definition, not size. A sidearm is a backup weapon, in case the primary weapons fails or the fight gets too close. Or like in this case, a way to show that you are not there to cause trouble, but that you still are concerned about your safety. No one would ever believe that you only plan to use a grenade launcher for self-defense, but it is another thing with a low-powered blaster pistol"**

As you descend the boarding ramp the Kaminoans look slighlty startled but recover quickly. The tech seems to hang back but the other a female moves forward with data pad in hand. Her voice has the soft melodious tone.
**"Greetings and welcome. What brings you to Kamino? Do you have any cargo to declare?"**
She glances at the weapon worn by Jordan but says nothing about it yet. She holds her data pad out expectantly for you to swipe your identa-chips. The tech seems to cock his head as if listening to something and you catch sight of an earbud comlink.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-09-27 16:38:15)

As he sweeps his identichip, Jordan casually sweeps his gaze past the tech. He takes a closer look at all the Kaminoans present, looking for any familiar faces. Looking calm and not appearing to even notice the looks at his weapon, he smiles towards the greeter.
**"No, nothing except myself and the rest of the people on board. As declared, we are here as tourists of a kind. Though to be honest, I´m mostly here to fly the ship and keep it running between stops"**
Throwing a quick glance towards the stormtroopers, he lowered his voice a little bit and spoke a few words in the Kaminoan tongue.

**"The trooper have been here since the Empire crushed our foolish attempt to throw off the Imperial yoke. Now our cloning facilities are under Imperial control and we now need Imperial permission to clone ourselves or anything else."**
The technician moves forward slowly looking the ship up and down.
**"Shall I begin my scans?"**

Arty glanced between the tall Kaminoan and the mando talk, frowning faintly. Damn...she hadn't thought to read up on some of the native language, bah...she had spent the entire trip to get the wookiees learning all about the native language and she had been so....busy...yes busy, she was not mopping. she was just..busy. That she hadn't thought of it.
Muttering a soft curse at herself her attention turns to the technician, raising a brow "Scan for what?"

He turns his large eyes on her. With an exagerrated blink and a slight bob of his head he answers
**"Scanning for contraban and illegal modifications or weapons of course."**

The smell, He had forgotten how lovely the salty air smelled here. He breathed in deep letting it infuse him. He took a moment to realize that the liaison had said.
Need Imperial permission to clone themselves? That was the equivalent of needing the Imperial seal to procreate for other species. How could things have gotten so out of control. He handed over his forged Identa-chip with a slight forced smile.
**"Regardless of the circumstances it was good to be home."**

Kro-sa struggles and finally masters the thick grating air of the planet, being careful not to breath too deeply lest he start hacking again. He does his best to look harmless by giving all around nice big smiles. He digs beneath his shipsuit and pulls out the indenti-chip Arty had given him and told him not to lose. He leans down so the chain holding it around his neck will reach the scanner. He listens to the conversations going on around him and notices a new word.
**"What issss dissss condraband?"**

Holding out a hand to signal the technician to wait for a second, Jordan turns to the Barabel.
**"Didn´t I give you a Basic dictionary to read up on? Anyway he just wants to check that we aren´t trying to smuggle anything illegal in"**
Turning back to the Kaminoan, he nodded.
**"Sure, go ahead and scan, but if you want to board, I want one of my crewmembers to accompany you. And just a heads-up, I am a mercenary, I have weapons on board, but as long as they remain there I see no need to make an issue out of it, right?"**

**"Yesss Jordan did, but dere are many many wordssss. Bassssic issss confussssing. I will go with dechnisscian, will get dictsssionary while on board. Okay?"** Kro-sa responds, looking at the local with the scanning equipment with an even bigger grin, trying to be helpful.

Arty chuckles faintly at the barabel shaking her head "Kro, if you were having issues why didn't you say so? I'd help you, I'm good with languages." she nods, brushing stray hairs behind her ear again only for them to all forward once more. Turning back to the technician she nods her head "be a dear and don't make a mess hm?"

The forged documents for the ship and crew seem to past inspection and the Kaminoan tech's scan of the ship is only a half hearted job. After a a quarter hour you are given leave to enter the city but weapons must remain on stun setting. You walk past the Imperial troopers and they seem not to notice you at least overtly. Suppressing a shudder you walk past them and enter the Capital of Kamino.

Arty shudders once she was far enough past the troopers, scratching at her arms and fluffing her hair "Anyone else feel dirty?" she shudders again "ugh they make me itch." she glances back to the troopers before turning away, she didn't like them; they seemed so....mindless.
"Happy thoughts please, where are we going and is there shopping?"
She was a female, and she did love shopping almost as much as she loved stalking Jax and....she stops that train of thought though it already had dampened her mood. Sighing she fluffs up her hair again and looks around.

**"SSSSeeee? Disssss issss why Kro-ssssa no assssk Arty for hep wid Basssic. Arty dissstracted too easssy,"** Kro-sa says as he watches Arty go from semi-cheerful to her ever-present black mood. He crouches low as he walks, looking at her from eye level. **"Cheer. UP!"** his jaws clack at his emphasized 'up' and he then grins to show he his playing with his mock-stern tone of voice.

Walking past the troopers and into the city, Jordan paid them little heed, except for noting where they had posts and how many they were. He listened with one ear to what his companions were taking about, his thoughts occupied elsewhere. He hadn´t though that returning to Kamino would affect him much, but walking around the place made many memories come back. Casually reaching up and touching the scar in his face, he stopped and looked around for a moment.
**"I wouldn´t bet on finding a shopping paradise if I were you. This place isn´t exactly placed along the main trade lanes, and I think they´re pretty comfortable in their isolation as well. Though if you´re into medical supplies, I guess you could find your share here"**
He wasn´t really sure where they were headed, he hadn´t spent a lot of time in the capital before. He had had two goals with bringing his team to Kamino, one was to pick up the armor he had left behind there years ago, and the second was to try and see if it would be possible to sway the Kaminoans to join the Rebellion. Their unmatched skill in medicine and gene technology could no doubt help a lot of rebel cells struggling against the Empire. Where to start was another issue though.
**"Keep your eyes open for anyone giving the stormtroopers the same face as we are doing. We´re looking for anyone who doesn´t really approve of this occupation"**

Arty smirked faintly "sooo...I'll go take a walk around then shall I?" she shifts to the side already looking for a good place to hide in, her gaze rapidly shifting about, if she were to find unrest...where would be the best place to look?
hm...someplace with either lots of troopers...or with none and they could speak freely...which would be the best option though? with more troopers there was the higher chance of being seen, but with locals...so far they seemed to not care about them.
Tilting her head to one side she looks up to the sky, so many choices...

**"Sounds good, and take Kro with you. A bit of muscle should ward of any trouble you might find. And bring our new recruit as well, he might know some things, at least he can help you with the language"**
Feeling the blaster at his side was secure, Jordan looked around for some sort of information center or public transportation hub. He knew exactly where he was heading, he just hoped the place was still open to the public. His last memories of Tipoca City might not be the most peaceful, but it was there he would find his armor, and hopefully some acquaintances from the past that might help him in his recruiting efforts for the Rebellion.

He scans the area his long neck craning around. This place always seemed so clean and sterile, since his time in the prison he had become accustomed to the dirt and grime.
**"I would be most pleased to assist the young lady. I'm not sure home many people I know are still alive or trustworthy enough to approach."**
Turning to Arty with a smile
**"My services are at your disposal. I used to know this bistro that served the best eel pies. I used to dream of them while I rotted away in a 5x5 cell eating nutrient cubes"**
He turns away from the memory and the young human his blueish eyes seem bright.

**"Eel? What isss disss eel? It tasssstesss good? Can Kro-ssssa have ssssome? Food cubesss bad…"** Kro-sa begins in his standard wistful naive way as he looks around scenting the air with his open mouth. An odd, almost childlike wonder rolls off him, along with a comfort in his own skin most civilized beings lack. **"What doesss sssentient mean, 'rodding in ssscell'? Ssssentient doessss not sssmell of rot and decay,"** a slight hint of confusion wafts from him, which could easily be dismissed as merely a tonal inflection.

Arty watches the tall alien, she had been so about to protest the two coming along, after all it did her little good to try and spy on people if those two messed things up but..well...a solid meal would be nice...and a bistro...hm...people would likely be more free to speak there.
She was about to answer but watching the Kaminoan...she felt this heart wrenching sadness wash over her, and then just as fast a mind numbing rage; she wanted to go on a rampage and tear everyone limb from limb and beat them over the head with their own arms; Her breathing picks up as the rage flies through her system; turning from him quickly she backs up a step, eyes wide.
The conversation of eel is nothing but mumbles in her ears, her hand to her chest as she pants to gain breath. Closing her eyes and gripping her hair she wills the emotion away; where the hell had that come from?? why had she been so angry looking at him? was it Antur? that he would have loved to see the planet? that if it hadn't been for the damn troopers he would have been with them still? was that it?
"y...yea" she stutters and squeaks, clearing her throat a moment, she felt pale..wondered if she was, "uh let's...let's get that...that pie thing.." she turns then, rubbing her head with one hand.

The Bistro is a comfortable and clean but only slightly crowded. Most of the patrons are long necked Kaminioans with an odd human scattered in. Your group receives several long looks as you enter and are led to a table. A holo menu pops up as the seat senses your weight.

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **Magical2099** (2011-10-19 14:05:12)

Kro-sa eagerly sits and begins trying to manipulate the menu, both fascinated by holo technology and eternally hungry. He asks questions about several dishes, hoping one of his companions will point out the ones with the highest protein content. He orders two eel pies and several other dishes, then takes in the sights the bistro has to offer.

## Re: The Revolution will not be Holovized

### **zerah** (2011-10-26 19:58:14)

Arty takes a seat as well, ordering a hard drink to steady her nerves and put her emotions back where they should be, damn things.
Looking over the menu, she patiently answers the questions to the best she can, offering suggestions before simply placing her own order of fairly plain food, she wasn't in the mood for anything fancy and at the moment simple stew was all that seemed appealing.
Glancing over the Kaminoan after he orders then to Kro, she sighs faintly and leans back "So...what's there to do while we wait for Jordan?" better to keep her mind occupied until that drink arrived. She rubbed her head faintly and sighed again, it was Antur..she just wasn't dealing with it and it was taking its toll, that's all...yea...
She glanced around the bistro idly, remembering the 'mission' they had.

The lunch finally arrives and is interesting to say the least but despite some questionable ingredients is delicious. You leave the bistro and find a hotel. Once everyone is settled into their rooms the hunt begins. A little info sharing between Toren-Ve and Jordan determines that the cloning facilities and everyone assigned to them were probably moved Timira city cloning facility. The major issue is that the city was destroyed and sunk into the sea by an attack by the fledgling rebellion.

Kro-sa listens with rapt attention to the tale of the Rebellion sinking an entire city, his limited imagination providing him the best picture it can. Soon he eats and readies himself for the day, then eagerly asks **"What are Kro-ssssa'ssss orderssss Jordan?"**
