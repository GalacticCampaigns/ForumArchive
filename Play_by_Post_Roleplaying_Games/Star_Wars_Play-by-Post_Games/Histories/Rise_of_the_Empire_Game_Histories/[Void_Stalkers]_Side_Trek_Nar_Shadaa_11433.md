# [Void Stalkers] Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-20 12:14:49)

Nar Shaddaa is the largest moon of Nal Hutta. More commonly known as the Vertical City, the Smuggler's Moon and Little Coruscant, Nar Shaddaa was similar to Coruscant in that its surface was entirely overgrown with city sprawl since 24,500 BBY But unlike Coruscant â€“ which was only relatively dangerous on the lower levels of the world city â€“ Nar Shaddaa was filthy, polluted, and infested with crime throughout.

A womans voice chirps over the comm system.
"Voidstalker one you are cleared to exit the hanger bay"
Jax says
"Take us out Mr. Revv."
The ship moves out of the hanger of the Tantive IV and moves into a hyperspace vector. A few minutes later the ship lurches into hyperspace. The next few days are filled with Deel tinkering around the ship running diagnostics and checking specs. He logs this into a database on his datapad. Arty has fun helping Deel or attacking Jax when he least expects it. Meeto starts a holoboard tournament that kills several hours as the crew watch and cheer as it comes down to Meeto and Zim. Meeto wins in the end but it was a close game. Jax wants everyone familiar with the different stations onboard so he runs a few drills and moves poeple around so everyone has some idea of everyone elses jobs. After three days you arrive in the Y'toub system. This is the center of the Hutt's territory and probably one of the most corrupt and dangerous places in the galaxy. It is the place to go to get anything and everything regardless of its legality. Jax barters with the docking crew for refueling and docking fees and after an hour or so in orbit you are allowed to land.

Arty wanders around her room, packing up the things she'll need in a small bag. Deciding to change out of her standard clothing she locks the door and changes clothes; a simple pair of brown trousers and shirt, no need for fancy on this planet, only draws attention of the worst kind.
Once she was finished she unlocks the door and steps out, slinging her bag on and wanders off to find the others.

### **ganthet** (2008-05-21 13:07:41)

Deel packs his tools and security kit and his datapad with the data for the ship on it and finishes getting the rest of his gear ready. He dresses in civilian clothes not to draw attention to himself. With his cloak hood pulled over his head he heads out of his room to try to find the others. Seeing that Arty has done the same. "Well I wasn't the only one who thought of regular clothes. So what do we do frist I have never been to the Sumglers Moon before?" Deel checks to make sure his blaster his at his side and ready just incase.

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-21 13:14:42)

Arty looks around for the voice to smile brightly at Deel, "Well, we can check out a few traders, or head to a cantina to get some good food, hmm..I have an account I need to check on first though before I do anything...oh! and after Captin's done with what he needs to do we're going shopping." she grins happily.

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **ganthet** (2008-05-21 13:26:40)

" Ok sounds good I guess. Is there any good driod shops around here, I have been wanting to build an idea I have for a driod nothing fancy mind you just like to tinker is all." Deel doesn't people to think all he thinks about is engine and circut boards. He does sometimes get carried away with his projects though. "I was thinking if we could come cross some manuvering jets for the ships maybe we could get the ships to handle better. I would also like to find some sublight engines also." Deel seems to notice that Arty isn't really worried about shopping for ship parts. He follows her to where she can check her accounts. "Sorry if I get alittle carried away with the tech talk, I just get lost in my work sometimes."

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-21 13:29:03)

Jax comes out of his quarters wearing civilian clothes and his heavy blaster strapped to his thigh in plain view. He puts on a black waist length jacket. He heads for the docking ramp and runs into Deel and Arty chatting away.
"Ok everyone stay in contact over commlinks and try to stay outta trouble. You have any plans on what to do or where to go?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-21 13:33:35)

Arty waves her hand "nonsence, I understand, Dad was the same way with his ship." She grins at him "Really I understand, it's nice to have something you're really passionate about." At the sight of the captin she grins "yup, heading to the bank first then off for some shopping, don't forget you and I are going shopping later."

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **ganthet** (2008-05-21 13:40:45)

"I guess I will follow Arty sir. I have never been hear before and don't really know my way around." Deel says. "I will try to keep her out of trouble sir." Deel smiles at Arty knowing that anything short of a Forcepike will not stop her when she wants to do something.

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-21 13:47:34)

Arty laughs and nudges the twi'lek "come on farm boy, lets go show ya what a bit smugglers city is like." she grins and looks up at the captin "you going to meet your contact now or you gonna tag a long with us?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-21 13:50:48)

"I think I'm gonna head over to the Corellian sector and hit a casino and have a drink. Stay in touch and stay together this can be a rough place."
Jax adjusts his pistol for a better draw.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-21 13:53:48)

Arty rolls her eyes, and rumages in a pocket "you and your gambling, don't blow everything." she grins, only teasing him and hands him a credit chip with a small amount of credits still on it "play something for me?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-21 14:38:55)

"You to stay outta trouble. I'm gonna wait and talk to the rest of the crew before I leave make sure they are good to go."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-05-21 14:49:22)

Nar Shadaa...also known as the SmugglerÂ´s Moon...
Jordan had been there before, seeking refuge after his flight from Kamino. The whole moon reeked of decay and corruption, things he wasnÂ´t very fond of. As he walked down the ramp of the VS1, he checked that the carbine was safely attatched to his hip, and strapped the slug rifle over his shoulder.
*"Where to captain?"*

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-21 15:13:13)

"I'm gonna hit a casino and maybe the bars in the correlian sector. You wanna tag along?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-05-21 15:43:10)

*"Sure thing, seems as good a place as any"*

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-21 15:58:42)

Arty waves to the captin as she leads the way to the bank. She chatters about the city to Deel as they walk, making sure to stick close to him while her hands were on her bag and the other near her blaster. She smiles as they finally near the bank, stepping in she moves to a free teller and smiles politely, leaning against the counter "Hi I'd like to check on my account." she passes over her ID chip and waits.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-21 16:16:13)

The droid takes your id and a retnal scan a few minutes later it gives you your balance.
"You have 5000 credits available for withdrawal from your account."

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-21 16:22:15)

Arty nods her head "I'll take it all if you don't mind." she turns her head to grin at the Twi'lek as she waits.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-21 16:25:55)

"As you wish."
The droid produces a credit chip with the total on it.
"Anything else I can help you with today?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-21 16:28:42)

"Think that's it thanks, have a nice day!" she smiles and waves to the droid and pockets the chip, linking her arm in Deels as she leads the way to the trader shops, looking for any with interesting wares within sight or any that she knew.
*Perception +8*

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-21 16:56:40)

Deel and Arty wander through the streets of Nar Shaddaa examining wares and stall. The stuff sold here seems to be sub quality. You come across a merchant who's parts aren't total crap. They seem well used but functional.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-21 16:58:16)

Arty frowns at the wares and pulls out her comlink "Hey Zim, you're good with people right? Mind giving us a hand?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-21 17:11:26)

Zim walks out of the ship as his comlink starts beeping.
*"Hey Zim, you're good with people right? Mind giving us a hand?"*
"Sure thing where are you at?"
He quickly follows the directions relayed and catches up to Arty and Deel.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-21 17:13:07)

Arty grins and waves to the man as she catches sight of him "Over here!" Once he was closer she'd explain "so..think you can help us find the better places to shop?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-21 17:18:55)

Zim wanders over and chats with the merchant about his wares and where he gets them. The merchant says for the right price he will direct you to his suppliers. Zim and the merchant then launch into a bidding war for the price of the information. Zim trying to lowball and the merchant trying to overcharge. In the end the price comes to 350 credits.
Zim smile at Arty
"How's that?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-21 17:20:47)

Arty grins and hands over the credits for the information "Perfect, thank you Zim!" she hugs him tight and looks expectently at the merchant.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-21 17:24:23)

The merchant gives you directions and a name
"You will be wanting to speak at a Duros who goes by the handle Swift, Boscoe Swift. He runs a repair shop in the Duros sector. He does alot of modifications for the smugglers. He lets me sell the parts he replaces for a small cut."

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-21 17:26:04)

Arty nods her head "Thank you!" she smiles and links her arms with the two men, pulling them lightly to walk with her as they make their way to the directed area.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-21 17:33:42)

The three of you make your way to the Duros sector. It is an old and run down area not alot of foot traffic. Most building seem abandoned and you feel people (you hope) watching you from the dark places. Your beginning to think this was a set up when finally find the place. Its a large building with several landing pads. There are three ships being worked on on these pads. You see a duros telling some technicians what to do on the closest pad.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-21 17:37:10)

Arty walks up to the Duros "excuse me, are you Mister Boscoe Swift?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **master_Tru** (2008-05-21 19:00:27)

Antur wakes late missing most of the docking procedure, gathers his gear stows his credits within a safe place on his person and heads out to meet up with the rest of the squad. "Whats up guys? Whats the plan?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-21 20:01:49)

***Location: Voidstalker 1. people present:Jax Antur Jake Meeto***
Jax chuckles as Antur comes wandering out.
"Nice of you not to sleep through the trip. Deel,Arty and Zim took off to see about mods for the ship. Revv and I were gonna go hit the casino."
***Location:Duros sector mechanic's shop. People present:Arty Zim Deel***
The Duros turns and wipes his hands on his coverals. He says in basic
"Depends on who is asking."

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-21 23:33:47)

Arty grins "A buyer looking for the best parts she can get, are you him?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **ganthet** (2008-05-22 01:18:25)

Deel looks around the shop while Arty and Zim handle the haggling part. Deel thinks to himself. *"We might be able to find everything we need here."*  Deel walks up to Arty and wispers something to her. "I want to look over the parts before we pay allright." Deel doesn't trust anyone when it comes to the parts that might save his or his friends lives.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **ganthet** (2008-05-22 14:22:14)

Deel continues looking around the shop. "I was just wondering if you had any Combat Thrusters, that is something that we are looking for right now." Deel hopes that they do it will help the ship manuver better in combat situations. "If you do I would to look them over frist."

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-22 14:32:43)

***Location:Duros sector mechanic's shop. People present:Arty Zim Deel***
The Duros walks over and offers his hand to every one.
"I am Boscoe, If you need ship parts legal or not you've come to the right place. Do you have scematics for your ship? That will make this process go alot smoother. You want to add combat thrusters? Looking to get into some trouble I see."
***Location: Voidstalker 1. people present:Jax Antur Jake Meeto***
Jax gathers up everyone left and you all hop into the LA-PT speeder. Jax drives through the massive city that feels alot like a slum section of corascaunt but instead of a sector it's the whole planet. A few minutes later he arrives at the Idiot's Array Casino. He parks the speeder in a secured garage.
"I don't know about you guys but I want a drink and some cards."
The casino is full service anything you want food/drink/recreation/clothes are available for purchase. There is also a huge amount of gambling facilities for your enjoyment.

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-22 15:08:58)

Arty shakes the offered hand and motions for the Twi'lek to pass over the scematics "We are also in the market for a hyperdrive and shields. Can you give us an estimate?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **ganthet** (2008-05-22 15:29:47)

Deel pulls out his datapad and calls up the specs for the VS 1. "We only have a couple of weeks thought. So I don't think we have time for all that work, but we can still talk about the Hyperdrive and the shields though." Deel hands the datapad to Arty. "I think we could do the Combat Thrusters this time and the rest at a later time."

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-22 15:34:10)

***Location:Duros sector mechanic's shop. People present:Arty Zim Deel***
Boscoe takes the scematics and looks them over, he motions for you to follow him as he heads inside. He leads you to an office where he sits down and uploads your scematics into a database. As he types away a holo-emmiter projects a picture of your ship. He punches somemore keys and the image changes to a cross section of your ships internals. The images add in the mods you requested and then lists a bunch on parts numbers.
"Well the parts for the thrusters and shields are gonna run about 25k. If you want my crew to install them it will be a labor fee."

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-22 15:36:44)

Arty shakes her hea "No no, we can install them ourselves, that's not problem. 25k huh? hm.." she glances over to Zim and subtle kicks his foot, trying to let him know it was time for his people skills.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **ganthet** (2008-05-22 15:40:04)

"We can do the mods ourselves, That is not a problem." Deel hopes that Zim can talk the guy down a bit. "If it is ok I would like to check the parts over before we buy." Deel smiles hopeing the gentleman doesn't mind him checking them out frist.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **master_Tru** (2008-05-22 16:33:11)

Antur strolls into the casino and sits at the bar ordering a after burner. Taking a moment to scan the crowd Antur looks to his squad "So whats the plan?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Yogi** (2008-05-22 20:27:48)

Jakes looks to his wingman after the question of what to do is asked. He looked back out over the casino as he takes a drink of that he had ordered. "Good question. A decent meal sounds good just no high stakes games of chance for me." When Antur looks at him Jakes stops him before he can ask. "Don't ask the story isn't very good."

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-05-23 02:17:28)

Jordans enters the casino along with the others, and surveys the people in it.
*"Something to eat sounds good"*

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-23 10:14:21)

***Location: Idiot's Array Casino People Present:Jax Jake Antur Meeto***
Jax points acrossthe casino to a buffet.
"The food here is pretty good why don't you guys go fill your boots. I'm gonna hit the sabbac tables. Comm if you need anything."
Jax wanders off towards the card tables. The buffet is very large and for a reasonable price (15 credits) you can eat your fill of a variety of different foods from around the galaxy.
***Location: Duros Sector Mechanic's shop People present:Arty Zim Deel***
Boscoe agrees to let you look over the parts if you wish. He acts a little insulted but you feel that might be a business tactic. He calls in a tech who will show you the parts he lists off. He and Zim then start working on negotiating a reasonable fee that will allow you guys to upgrade your ship and still feed his six children.
The parts are all in excellent condition a few parts are actually brend new never used.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **master_Tru** (2008-05-23 10:52:06)

Antur shrugs his shoulders at Jax as the man hits the sabbac table. Antur walks to the buffet and pays enough credits for Jake,Meeto and himself to eat. "We could try our luck at a few tables maybe even double our creds, anyone game after we eat?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **ganthet** (2008-05-23 12:25:27)

"These are great, most of them are brand new." Deel is amazed of the fact that some are brand new., but knows better then to ask questions. "Once price is set, we can take these to the ship and I can get started." Deel looks forward to installing the new parts to help them out with there missions. The Captian should be impressed.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-23 14:19:18)

Arty listens to the two negotiate a price, glancing over to the twi'lek with a smile at his surprise, making a note to take him shopping more often, he was fun. Her attention moves back to the negotiations, hoping they'd settle soon on a decent price.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-05-23 17:07:44)

As they sit down and taste the food of the buffet, Jordan allows himself to relax a bit. Not much, just a bit.
*"IÂ´m not the gambling type, but if you need someone to stand in for the pretty ladies that are usually found at the side of gamblers, just say so"*

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-24 14:06:43)

Zim thoroughly enjoyed his verbal jousting with Boscoe Swift, dickering over each component, and pointing out any perceived flaws in each, and a "reasonable" price for same. The Duros was clearly a veteran negotiator, but Zim had some skill in this area as well. After reading the language of the Duros, Zim threw out a price of 15k credits for the parts. He realized this price was probably a bit low, but that was a decent place to begin.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-24 14:39:12)

***Location: Duros Sector Mechanic's shop People present:Arty Zim Deel***
Boscoe and Zim continue thier haggling.
"15000?!! Oh no my friend that is much to low I have seven mouths to feed. The price cannot be lower than twenty thousand and that includes allowing me to resell the replaced parts."
Zim gets the feeling this is a fair deal and that Boscoe won't go any lower.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-24 16:17:48)

"If you would allow me a few moments to collect the credits, I think we might have a deal, Boscoe." Zim turns to Arty and Deel, and tells them this is the lowest possible offer and that everyone should try to gather the additional credits.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **ganthet** (2008-05-24 16:53:03)

Deel hands over the 5000 credits that Senator Organa gave him. "Well it is for a good cause and all." Deel wishes that they would have wnt for just the combat thursters but shields are a good thing as well. And he will have plenty to do putting in the new parts. Deel looks at Arty. "Well atleast I will be busy for awhile, and I can allways work on my side project later."

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-24 19:02:05)

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-24 21:41:16)

Arty winks "not a problem!" she grabs her comlink and punches in the memorized frequency for the Captin "Hey! Captin! you haven't spent everything yet have you? 'cause...if you happen to have another 5k on you we will have shields and thrusters."

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-25 01:21:50)

Meeto never made it to the buffet, his eye's glazed over as he scanned upon the mecca of gaming; a casino. The lights blinking and the sounds of the credit machines had put Meeto in a zombie like state. He moved to his favorite game, saabac.
((Meeto gambles using 3000 credits.))

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Frost** (2008-05-26 10:56:02)

"Sure I've got some extra cash. Where are you at?"
Jax makes note of the directions and heads out of the casino. He didn't really have time to play a hand yet but duty calls. About fifteen minutes later he drops off 5000 to Arty.
"Ok Ive got to run to make my meeting."
Jax then heads back towards the correllia sector.
Meeto sits a table full of players and gets lost in the game. The cards flash and drinks are passed around. The game is gonna go for a while.
The boys at the buffet have stuffed themselves.

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-26 12:01:43)

Arty thanks the captin before he left then gathers up the credit chips and holds them up in one hand "20k for the thrusters and the shields and we'll get you our old shield generator once we've gotten it out deal?" She holds out her empty hand to shake and close the deal.

***Location:Duro sector Mechanics shop People present:Deel Arty Zim***The duros shakes your hand. He asks where and when you want the parts delivered. You make arangments for delivery.
***Location:Idiot's array casino People present: Meeto Jake Antur Jordan***
Meeto is engrossed in a sabbacc game and he seems to be doing ok at the moment.
Twilek females are making eyes at the buffet boys waving them over to thier table for some drinks.

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-26 14:45:22)

Arty grins and waves "It was a pleasure doing buisness with you, will meet you back at the ship with the generator." She links her arms with the boys again and moves them back to the ship, "so we need to get that part out as quick as we can so that when the new ones get here we can put them in right away!"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **ganthet** (2008-05-26 14:49:24)

Deel waits for the deal to conclued, already figureing out how long it will take to get everything up and going. Even with Arty and XO to help it is going to take awhile. "So I am assuming that he is going to deliver the parts to the ship right?" Deel hopes that they will because they will have to find away to get them there. When he hears the they will be delivered he is elieved and follows Arty and Zim out of the of the shop and torwrd the ship. "Well at least I will be doing this vaction."

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-26 14:56:35)

Zim: "Yep, Deel, he will have the parts delivered to our ship, when he will take our scrap." Zim thinks for a second and asks, with a smile, if either of the two wanted to see the rest of the planet. He loved the rush of the negotiations, but the idea of doing all the required mechanic work did not interest him in the least bit.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-26 15:22:36)

Arty laughs and nods her head "Sounds fun! I should scope out some places for shopping...speaking of which.." she removes her arm from one of the boys to grab her comlink and contact the Captin "Oh Caaaaptin! arre you done with your meeting?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **ganthet** (2008-05-26 15:28:23)

"Oh great you guys are going to leave it up to me huh.?" Deel kind of looks a little depressed. "Oh well at least i will have XO to help. If you guys need me I will be at the ship." Deel starts to walk to the ship still kind of thinking of what he will start on frist. "So You guys going to atleast help me get back to the ship?"

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-05-26 20:04:38)

The day gives way to night. Nar Shaddaa seems to transform with the setting of the sun. The air seems to have a dangerous feel to it. The vendors pack up thier wares and the seedier side comes out to drink, fight, and gamble. Prositutes of all types and species start working the streets.

Arty looks over at the voice and and offers a small smile, she wasn't in the mood to joke, Captin never went this long without at least saying something to her. The thought had crossed her mind of maybe he found a floozie but even then he at least told her he'd be late. She waits for the others to catch up before leading the way to where the information said he was.

They didn't need to see her eyes watering and she sure as hell wasn't about to cry in front of them, no she'd wait until she was back in her room with the door locked and she could talk to X0.

A little bored and fighting the idea of trying to console Arty, which in itself could turn counter productive Antur looks up when Jordan asks where Meeto is going. "A little action would be better then waiting around, whats up?"

Upon seeing the entire crew was back on board, Zim decided to relax for a bit. His meditation had been going well, and he clearly was making objects move with his mind now. He didn't necessarily want to let the crew in on this just yet.
He saw the group beginning to pack up to run an errand. Zim approached the group and asked if they wanted to get Arty, or at least make sure she was okay before leaving.

Jake was kinda surprised at the way the Captain spoke to Arty but then again excessive amounts of alcohol could do that to a person. Finishing his drink he headed over to the table as they made ready to move the very drunk Captain. "I'll lead the way and keep an eye out. Last thing we need is a unpleasant surprise here.
Back at the ship he sits with Antur. "Is this normal for the Captain?" He hoped it wasn't. Drinking now and then was not a problem but falling down drunk especially on this planet was a way to a quick death. Jake watched and listened as Meeto was asked about where he was going. *Getting your sounds like a good idea.* He thought to himself.

Metto didn't seem to share the same emotions as Arty, even though he has been with the Captain as long as Arty he understood the presure of being a leader. He respected the Captain's leave time, and tried not to let emotions get involved. Detachment from emotions has gotten the rodian this far, and in these dire times its not wise to make too many friends. The Captain and Arty were his best friends and he almost never talks to them. Having more attachments with droids and computers than people Meeto tends to be alone most of the time, but there was something different about this crew and it was testing Meeto's willpower to form new friendships with his crew mates.
Meeto is gearing up and he packs his blaster which is unusual for the Rodian, but it could be common sense to be holding on Nar Shadaar. He notices Jordan and Zims interest in him leaving and turns to them.
'I'm heading out to look into buying some hard to find items, I found a contact that looks promising. I could use the extra muscle in case its a hoax, the man isn't exactly selling things you find in any old market. He only deals in cash, which in his line of work is not unusual but I like to be cautious when dealing with illicit merchants. Interested in coming? You might find some had to find items that are not exactly legal in most systems, but in our line of work you need every edge you can get.'
Meeto waits with his pack over his shoulder waiting to see if anyone wants to join him.
((Meeto brings with him 4000 credits to purchase items from his contact ))

Arty sniffs as her stomach grumbles in protest of not having a meal yet. She sighs, and tries to ignore it but finds she can't. Sighing again she stands and wraps herself in the blanket, a vain attempt to hide from the world and hoped the captin had passed out on the floor somewhere...somewhere within reach of her foot. The thought makes her smile slightly only to frown, she wouldn't do that even if he was within reach, but the thought helped.
"Come on X0...I need to get something to eat.." she pauses at the door and sighs, before walking out and to the common room, to look for something to eat.

Lace drops off his bag of belongings on the ship, then follows the trio as they head to the parts shop, taking only his knife with him. He doesn't particularly like going to these kinds of places, but he's experienced worse while working for Imperial Intelligence. The Human catches up just as the group arrives, but stands aside from the rest of them while looking at Neo's wares, attempting to give off the air of not being with Meeto or the others.
Should his new friends encounter trouble, Lace can hopefully get the jump on the source of said trouble, since said trouble will not be expecting him to come to their aid.

Realizing that if the transaction goes sour, the shopkeeper is likely to use his droids as thugs, Lace suddenly feels very naked with only the knife as protection. He's not used to fighting enemies that lack arteries.

Arty opens her eyes to see the cold color of the floor before her. It takes her a few moments to remember why she was curled up on the floor, but when she does she sighs and sits up "a new day.." she huffs "I hope he has a headache."

You are all awakened by the ships collision warning going off. The loud alarm stops and the captains voice comes over the ships intercom.
"All personnel meet in the lounge in 15 minutes."
You look at the chronometer its 0600 in the morning.

### **zerah** (2008-06-16 12:47:52)

Arty mutters under her breath as she scrambles to untangle herself from the blanket wondering how they could be in trouble while docked, and that apparently he didn't -have- the headache. Finally getting free she moves to her door, unlocks it and rushes out to the lounge.

Antur awakes from an uncomfortable nights sleep to the captains voice over the PA. Looking around Antur shakes his head and says to himself "At least I wont be late." Antur had fallen asleep in the lounge.

### **zerah** (2008-06-16 13:58:17)

Arty rubs her eyes as she comes into the lounge, looking over first to se Antur at the table. She raises a brow as she moves to him, taking a seat in the chair beside him "how did you get here so fast?"

Arty glances at the captin as he walks in, frowning at him before simply turning away from him; no, no more crying, he wanted to be professional then fine she'd treat him just like she treated the other higher ups.

Deel walks into the lounge in his utilitys, tool pouch in one hand data pad in the other. Taking a seat next to Arty and Antur. "Sorry if I am late Capt. I was just finishing some stuff up. After breakfast I will get started on thee mods again."

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **master_Tru** (2008-06-16 17:03:47)

When Arty sits down beside him, Antur makes an attempt to look presentable. Whispering to Arty "Well ..... I was locked out. I hope you slept well." Antur tries to give the captain his attention, though the task is made more difficult with Arty beside him. Antur barley notices Deel taking a seat on the other side but does catch himself looking at Arty longer then was intended.

The collision warning alarm startled Meeto, it was one of the most dreaded sounds to be awoken from a dead sleep while traveling in space. He was sprawled out in his work chair that he had lounged way back. He must have fallen asleep when he was working on his new toys. It was way too early and his room was a mess with droid parts spread out over the floor. Meeto carefully stepped through his man made caltrops of droid parts to the refresher to try and clean himself up. The grease was stubborn, so he grabbed a clean rag and moved the meeting area.
Droopy eyed and dirty Meeto takes a seat slumping his tired body into the chair next to Deel, it wasn't unusual for Meeto to look this way because he was always staying up too late. Waking up early was the hardest thing for the rodian, he was more of an late night type that enjoyed the quietness while everyone else was sleeping.
He turns to Deel and can't help let out a yawn,
'Hey Deel I couldn't find any remote droid parts, I was quite surprised the junk yard didn't have such a simple scraped droid. I was lucky enough to find an astromech wheeled chassis and processor. Come by my room and you can take a look it needs a lot of work, I got the guts but it desperately needs accessories, lacking tool attachments and all the other goodies.'

Deel looks up from his Datapad. "Sure I can't take alook. Not to worried about the remote though just an idea I had. If you got time I could use a hand with the mods onn the ship if you have time." Deel truns his attention back to his datapad until the Captain tells everyone what is going on for the day.

Zim makes his way to the meeting hall, running uncharacteristically late. He had been out long hours last night with half the team, and was a bit less enthusiastic than normal. " Mornin'," he grunted to everyone, who had already gathered before he met up with them.
"What's on tap today, Cap?"

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-17 02:50:59)

Meeto grunts out to Zim, '"Morn'n' then turns back to Deel.
'I'm so tired Deel' Meeto's head slumps over to his left shoulder to take a peek at Deel's data pad trying to spy on whatever he is working on, but he is not trying to be sneaky just nosy.'This better be good and I hope its not bad news. I hate mornings. The problem with space travel is you never know when its morning and then you hit a system and the bright sun reminds you that there is a morning. Modifications? I can help with modifications to the ship, maybe later when I'm more alert.'

"All right people listen up."
Jax stands up and moves where everyone can see him.
"I have some bad news and some good news. Bad news first Lt Jake Golan has received information about his mother. He seems to have located her and requested a leave of absence to find her. He is a fine warrior and a fine officer and I will miss him and hope he finds what he is seeking and returns to us unharmed. The good news is we have a new recruit. This is Lace Asher he will be working with the squad as a liason to our intelligence network."
He waits for the news to sink in about Jake's leaving and Lace's joining. He then continues.
"I need this ship back together asap. Who ever can work a hydrospanner go with Deel and get to work. If you don't know anything about mechanics you shuldn't be on a spaceship but if you have computer skills go with Meeto and help him calibrate and re-align the new additions. If you can't fix the ship or the computers then the freshers need a good scrubbing this ship is a mess. Lt. Pyuuma I need to speak with you in private, the rest of you are dismissed."
The captain starts walking out waving for Arty to follow him.
*ooc:last chance to let me know if you want any new equipment or supplies. OtherwiseI'm wrapping up this little side trek.*

The news of Jake leaving was sad, the news that the ship needed fixing...well...that really wasn't news to Arty; but the request to speak to her in private, even if she was still mad at him, had her worried. She gives a mumbled "yes Captin.." at the request, gives Anturs hand a small squeeze if only to help ground herself again before standing and following the Captin, keeping to a respectful distance, unlike usual when she'd be right beside him.

Arty's eye twitched, somehow she should have seen this coming. Well...he wanted to know. So she crossed her arms and frowned at him "you decided to go out drinking with the new guy, didn't pick up the damn comlink to even just say that, you had me pacing the entire ship in worry and THEN when we finally go out and track your ass we find you completely smashed and then you!!" she was getting upset all over again as she talked, pacing slightly as she spoke, arms flailing about to make her point known as her eyes started to water and her voice began to choke up.
"YOU!! I told you that you had me worried! I told you, that you know better than to do that! that you're supposed to check in if you're going off!! and You!!! you told me and i quote!!" to which she takes on a drunked impercination of him with a hint of mockery "I da Captian I'm incharge. I know where your at what your doing not the other way aroind girly. You repor to me I don't check in wits you." She glares at him, tears streaming down her cheeks though if she noticed them through the haze of rage was anyones guess really.

Antur gives a salute to the captain and a "Yes Sir!" and gives Artys hand a gentle squeeze back resisting the urge to hold on as she leaves the room.
After the Cap and Arty leave Antur stands and says"Well you heard the order boys lets get to work, Deel what do you need me to do I have some skill with a hydro spanner?"

"Well in my defense I was drunk...not that its an excuse. I'm sorry I made you worry but there are times when I will have to be out of contact and do things that need to be done with out having about the squad kicking in the door. I do appreciate your concern."
If she lets him he give her a hug.
"I'm really sorry Arty."

### **zerah** (2008-06-17 12:40:22)

Arty batted him off at first, before relenting. Sniffing as she allowed him to hug her, using his shirt as a tissue for her eyes. "I know that...but on this planet of all places to suddenly not hear anything from you..we called you, and you didn't answer..I thought you were taken captive or worse." She sniffs again and hugs him tightly.

Arty's eyes widen "oh hell they're working on her now aren't they?!" she yelps and makes for the door, stops then runs back to him. She kisses his cheek and grins "You're forgiven now." she then laughs and runs out the door and down the hall to the others, moving to a jog then a walk where she stops beside Antur, laying a hand on his arm lightly "I promise not to lock you out tonight..I'll even sleep out in the lounge to make up for it.."

Antur stops rumaging through his tools when Arty meets up with him, looks at her and smiles " No worries, you looked upset last night. No need to sleep in a chair." Antur pulls himself from a stare "Now lets get this ship out of here and back to saving the galaxy." Antur continues gathering tools to repair the ship offering Arty access to the ships tool kit as well.

Arty blushes lightly, having been staring at him she turns rather quickly, hoping he didn't notice her willing the red from her cheeks away. Greatfully she takes the tool kit, waiting for him to finish grabbing tools so they could walk together tucking a few hairs behind her ear only to have them move forward again into her eyes, though it allowed her to look at the man slightly hopefully without him knowing she was staring.

Deel already working on where he left off last night. "Ok XO I think we have got this installed. Lets go ahead and calabate it. The Captain should love way the ship handles after these a set." Deel pulls out his commlink and calls Meeto. "I have the thursters installed and ready for ajustments. I am going to head inside and get started on the Shield Generator." Deel grabs up his tools and heads inside. "Come on XO lets get this finshed up so we can get out of rock and back to saving the galaxy." Using his commlink again Deel calls Arty. "If you are done giving the Captain grief about last night I could use your help with the shield generator."

Arty blinks as her comlink goes off and fumbles with it for a minute, cursing herself for staring at the man next to her "y..yea Deel! I'm done for now, shield generator? I'll be there in a minute." She looks over to Antur and blushes lightly "are...um..would you like to come help us or did you have another section to work on?"

Antur tries to hide the smile on his face but can`t. Stuttering like some love struck teenager Antur manages to reply "I I ...I know a little about shields. I can help." Antur follows Arty offering to carry the tool kit for her. As Antur walks behind Arty he does a face palm for stuttering in front of her and shakes his head at himself. "So about the locked cabin, we should try to work out the arrangement we have with our quarters."

### **zerah** (2008-06-17 19:19:16)

Arty couldn't help but smile and blush when he offered to carry her tool kit. She was grinning like a fool as she walked ahead of him, though at his words she drops back slightly to walk beside him, her arm brushing against his every so often. She noticed but she tried not to show it, and hoped he didn't move away "ah..r..right...I..I'm really sorry about that..I shouldn't have locked it on you...but...but maybe we could change the lock? so..if we want to lock it the other can still get in?"

The next few days fly by as the Captain keeps you busy getting the ship ready to go. After 2-3 days of work you test out the modification. The Captain takes the cruiser through some impressive manuevers this ship does things most starfighters can't do. He calls another team meeting.
"Good job guys this ship handles like a ship half its size. Im proud of you guys. Now are you ready to get back to our real work?"

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-18 05:44:22)

Why the thought of an assassin joining the ranks of the crew didn't bother Meeto was beyond his reasoning. It must have been the lack of sleep, or the fact the captain was drinking with the man and seemed quite fine with him. Looking a bit perplexed Meeto didn't give it another thought, and slowly got up from his seat moving to help with the newly installed systems. Meeto lacked the enthusiasm of Antur's solider etiquette, and responded to the captains orders with a sleepy 'affirmative captain' and ending with a yawn.
Meeto yells to stop Antur before replying to Zim
'Hey Antur wait up.'
As Meeto and Zim are talking they head in the direction of Antur
'Let's go Zim, we have some new modifications that Deel, Antur, and Arty are installing that need calibrations. They are going to do most of the hardware installation, and we are going to have some fun making sure the new systems are communicating correctly with our systems. Let's meet them in engineering.'
Meeto pulls out a datapad that looks like its seen alot of abuse. He starts displaying schematics of Antur's Voild Stalker Y-wing fighter and turns to Antur.
'Antur I've been looking at the Void Stalker Y-wing fighter you have been piloting. If I tweak with thruster proportion calibration mixtures I can increase the ships speed considerably. Nar Shaadar should have parts to do the upgrade, but its going to cost some credits. A little less than nineteen thousand credits. I also took some time looking over your shield calibrations and its possible to increase the power of your shields increasing field strength for those close encounters you tend to find yourself in, but there is a problem. The power used for these modifications is considerable, meaning I could only apply one modification. This is a specialized non-stock modification upgrade, and if I can get Deel, Arty and yourself to help we can complete the modifications in approximately five days.'
Meeto seems excited and shows Antur the numbers and technical readouts that he has been staying up late nights working on.
Computer Display: [hide]Increase Ships Speed by +4 or Increase Ships Shield Rating by 5[/hide]
'I'm going to be heading out to the city again to buy some items, maybe if we pull our credits we can do the upgrade. I think I have about three or four thousand credits I can spare, talk to the others and see what they have.'
((OOC: I want to make one more trip to an actual droid shop that sells used/new droids. looking for a labor droid and a remote droid for Deel. Will use the ships computer to access the Holonet and do a Trance (gather info +15) to find a good droid shop. Also looking to do some Tech Specialization Modifications to Anturs ship so I will need materials if we can muster 18,500 credits. When I'm not looking for parts I Will aid Deel, Antur, Zim and Arty with newly installed systems on VS1.))

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **master_Tru** (2008-06-18 05:58:31)

Antur lets out a whistle when he looks at the data pad "Nice both look god but with my flying style I think speed would be better. I have 5000 credits I could spare I was saving up for a ship of my own but if we can do these missions faster I can make that back." Antur pauses then looks over to Arty, where he was heading before Meeto stopped him. "Hey Arty what do you think of these mods to my Y-wing?" Antur turns a shade of red when he calls out to her, especially where its probably obvious that he is including her in this only to get closer to her. Though over the last few days Antur has made every excuse to get close to Arty from working on shield generators to power converters.

Lace yawns. Stretching to wake himself, the assassin finally gets up and begins doing his daily exercises. He has been getting rather bored sitting idle on the ship, so before long he approaches Meeto and Antur and offers to lend a hand to their work with the Y-wing.
"I've picked up some mechanical skill lately. Mind if I help with whatever it is you're doing?"

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-06-18 11:37:25)

Arty pauses and back tracks at the sound of her name, willing the blasted blush from her cheeks; she couldn't help that she actually kind liked hearing her name when he said it. "Sure, lets see what we have here." Rather than take the datapad from him she simply leaned against him, with a hand on the pad to move it to where she could see it, it'd been like that the past few days; trying to find any excuse to just be near him and there were quite a few reasons she could come up with of why it was she had to hold something and just needed a little help because it was heavy. It worked, she just hope he didn't catch on. "Wow this looks great...that's gonna cost though you're right.." she looks up to Antur, blushing faintly "I could help you with cost..I have 5000 left.."
Glancing over to the new member she offers a smile "Hi, sorry didn't really get a chance to say hi to you, I'm Artemis, Arty for short."

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **master_Tru** (2008-06-18 12:06:02)

Antur leans into Arty as she leans into him which a few days ago would have turned him red. Lately the two have been getting closer together something that has made Antur much happier.
At Arty`s offer of 5000 credits Antur gulps "Wow I was looking forward to you making up for locking me out, but I had other things in mind." With that last part Antur canâ€™t hold back a wide smile towards her.
Antur fails to notice the new member of the squad until Arty says hi to him. Still distracted Antur manages a nod in his direction.

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-06-18 12:19:31)

Arty looks back to Antur and blushes, smiling shyly "I..could still make it up to you, a few credits isn't enough to make sleeping out in the lounge all night better.." Even as she spoke, inside she was jumping for joy that he was leaning against her, the action making a shiver run down her spine that she played off as a chill in the air. "And..we should really talk about a way to work the lock so..neither of us gets locked out like that."

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **master_Tru** (2008-06-18 12:35:38)

Still leaning against Arty and still smiling Antur responds "Well 5000 credits is not exactly a few credits. I think the least I could do would be to offer you .... Lets say dinner? For two!" Antur does blush at that and looks to the ground shyly.

---

## Re: Side Trek: Nar Shadaa

### **zerah** (2008-06-18 12:39:58)

Arty blushes too, but leans up and kisses his cheek "dinner sounds like a great idea..it's a date." She grins at him happily, she had a date! Now to just make sure the others didn't ruin things...or one person...*'mental note: rewire the lock on the captins door so he can't get out for that night.'*

He turns to XO and asks. " So my friend the Captain seemed pretty pleased with mods on the ship. I can't wait to try them out in combat, when are we heading back." "Not really alot left here for me to do other then see the sites, and I have way to much work left on other prodjects to do that."

Meeto slants his head slightly watching the two banter over there kind words to each other. He was happy to see Arty in a better mood, and even more excited that they were only four thousand five hundred credits short of the job. If the credits were raised then he would have to put his droid side projects on hold.'
'If we can come up with another four thousand five hundred credits we are in business, I can ask Deel.' As Meeto gently grabs the datapad back into his hands he notices the two still smiling at each other as if the datapad didn't exist.
Meeto moves to engineering to talk to Deel letting the two have some privacy.

Deel hears foot steps coming down the hall toward the engine room. He turns to see Meeto. "Hey hows it going I am sorry I havn't been by the check out those driod parts you bought. Just been busy, So what can I do for you?" Deel continues to clean and make adjustments where needed.

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-19 06:52:00)

Meeto's eyes are glued to his datapad, somehow didn't hit a wall or knock into anything on his way to engineering to meet up with Deel. Rodian's keen sense of surroundings and of course the familiarity on Void Stalker One helped Meeto dodge the known bulkheads and junk that always was lying around. Meeto was working on cleaning up the junk, but he was too busy looking over Antur's ship schematics.
'Hey Deel, I think I just unadverdently conned Antur and Arty out of ten thousand credits.' Meeto laughs at his own absent mindedness.
Meeto turns to Deel not worried about Deel not having time to come by and see the new droid parts after all it hasn't been very long since he told him.
'I've been so concerned about how to do special modification on Antur's Y-Wing that I overlooked the obvious solution to upgrade both fighters for the half the credits.'
Meeto looks over his new calculations on his worn datapad
'Hmmm... Don't you think a months worth of fuel and supplies is a bit much for short range fighter.' Meeto asks rhetorically. 'I mean, the Y-Wing long probe was initially used for long duration scouting missions. We really don't have any use for such space being wasted. We need to convert the fighters to a more versatile short range fighter to protect VS1 which means we need to increase there speed. The original modifications I told Antur about were frivolous, if we can find a starship parts dealer on Nar Shaadar and get some new sublight drives, then we can have them installed in a few days time with minimal cost. I'm going to need your help because your going to do the installation. Your skill with a hyperscanner is better than anyone on the ships except maybe XO's' Meeto gives XO a pat. 'I will assist you as well as Arty, Antur, XO and Lace said he knows a little bit about mechanics, we will need him too. Looks like our newest member Lace is going to be piloting the Void Stalker 3, but I don't want to do any modifications until we know how he pilots. Let him get comfortable in the hot seat then we can figure out what needs to be modified. Right now I want to concentrate on VS1 and VS3.'
Meeto stops looking at the datapad and looks up at Deel
'I'm so tired Deel, I need a stimulate drink. I will be right back to help you out. You want anything from the kitchen? Oh I might have found you a remote droid, gunna be 1200 to 1600 credits just depends if you want it used or new. You can come with me to pick up the parts and we can go get it together. I want Zim and maybe some others to come too. I don't like walking around Nar Shaadar without back up.'

"I'm here, Meeto," Zim exclaims to his rodian friend. "I had to get out of there, too. It was a little uncomfortable watching those two make eyes at each other."
"I am going to my quarters for a bit, but I would be more than happy to head out with you later on. Just give me a buzz, when you are ready." Zim heads away from the two toward the quarters area.

"If you could get me some juice that would great. As far as the credits I spent most of what I had on the mods for VS1." Deel puts down his tools and walks over and looks at Meeto figures. "Well that would do it, but wouldn't we just get issued new fighters for different rolls. I know we havn't so far but we may in the future." Deel continues to look over Meeto's datapad. and takes out his. "Why don't you copy those to my datapad so I can continue studying them."

Antur does not even notice that most of the crew have already left, when he does he finds that he has been staring into Arty`s eyes. "A date it is then we could plan for something better then a smugglers moon could offer after our next mission." Antur winks at Arty and looks around noticing that the others have left. Chuckling "Maybe we should get to work or something, I can assist in any repairs your scheduled to do just let me know what you need."

Arty looks around as well and flushes, she hadn't even realised the others had left. She chuckles softly and tugs at his hand as she starts to move to the engine room "hmm...maybe we could make a request to the Captin?" she hums, softly as she walks, forgetting about her hand in his for the moment "I suppose if we don't get another chance to have time off we...could have dinner here on the ship or back at base." she looks up at him biting her lip as was habit.

Antur smiles as he hold Artys hand "We could do that but it won`t count though." Antur grins "We will also have to do this right to, catered meal drinks, a beautiful view ..... and the scenery will be nice too." Antur winks at Arty as they walk towards their next job.

Arty blushes as she pushes her shoulder playfully against his "You're a real charmer...somehow though I don't mind." She smiles up at him "So..if we have dinner together on the ship..we'll still get to have a meal together off the ship? I think this is a good plan!"

Antur bumps Arty's shoulder back playfully in response "So tonight then? Then for our real date we just have this little mission to get through." Antur stares at the Ship for a moment as the two continue "I have been a pilot all my life you know." Antur looks Arty in the eyes "Right now though I feel as though I could take on the whole empire."

Arty's blush darkens at his words, she hadn't felt like this in...well....she couldn't really remember when. "The whole empire...all on your own?" She chuckles softly "what's given you that kind of power?" She looks at the engines while lightly leaning against him "As for tonight, where shall we be dining?"

Meeto meets up with Zim and Deel in engineering, along with anyone else that seems to be there.
'Let's go see if we can get those sublight engines, and possibly some more droid parts. I found a droid shop that sells used and new parts, and we can use the same shop that you got the upgrades for VS1 for the parts we will need for VS3.'
Meeto makes sure to tell everyone in case they are interested in going, and partially for the extra protection.

Meeto turns his data pad around in his hands and pauses as he waits for the others to get ready to do one last trip.
'I think I did it again, I was concentrating so hard on one thing that I got over excited and missed the obvious.'
Meeto calls Antur on comm.
'So did you get to take a closer look at those modifications Antur? I can go out and get the parts we need, before we leave this rock. We are still short some credits I was going to ask Zim or Jordan if they could spare some.'
Meeto looks at the two as he waits for Anturs reply over his comlink
((OOC: Antur just to clarify, I messed up. Faster sublight engines would cost more than the tech specialist mod. So, for +1 space scale speed and 18,500 we can do the special mod when we get back to VS2. Let me know if you want to go through with it, because I will need to come up with a few more credits, and then I will have to hold off on droid parts purchases.))

Having spent most of the day with Arty working on the ship and most of the night, the two seem to be getting along very well. Annoyed at the interruption to his Arty time Antur answers Meeto`s hail "Ummm I am good with that, but I am not really a tech. I just need my wings and a great mechanic to put her back together." Antur winks at Arty with his great mechanic comment. "Though an Astro droid would aid a lot in combat missions, it would cut down on my work load."
((Is it possible for us to put the driod port back in?))

'Well save your credits then Antur and work on your evasive manuevers.' Meeto kids. 'I will work on putting a Astomech together for you, maybe Deel can give me a hand I already have one in the works. I need some more time looking over the schematics of your Y-wing anyway I want to brainstorm with Deel and the others, there might be potential in other areas we don't want to be too hastily and throw all of our credits into something we may not need.'
Meeto out-
((OOC: I think you still have the Astro port just not using it, but either way we can install one if needs be. What's the offical word Frost?))

*ooc:The longprobe Y-wings have navcomputers in them. The droid port and extra seat for the gunner have been removed. The parts you want are cost x2 at the Duros mechanic shop.*

Meeto looks at the prices and shakes his head.
'Too expensive.'
Never one to really be good at bargaining, he doesn't attempt to even try.
'Let's head out to the droid shop and grab some parts that we can actually afford, this place is overpriced.'

Arty had blushed at the comment of being a great mechanic, and nuged his shoulder playfully. She had been having the best time with him, until the com had interrupted. Overhearing the talk she smiles at the pilot "a droid hm? Be nice for X0 to have another droid on board I'll bet...speaking of droids where is he?" It seemed that in all her time with talking the pilot she had completely forgotten about her friend.

You are finally ready to leave the smuggler's moon behind you. As you recieve permission to leave from flight control the ship makes its way out to the jump point. A few moments later you are safely in hyperspace ready to rendevous with the Tantive IV.
