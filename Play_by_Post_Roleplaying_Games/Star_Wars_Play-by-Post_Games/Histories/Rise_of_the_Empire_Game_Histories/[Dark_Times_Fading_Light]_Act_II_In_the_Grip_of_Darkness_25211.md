# [Dark Times: Fading Light] Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-03-26 20:06:55)

*"We've received reports of a rogue Jedi engaging in terrorist acts against the Empire. While we're not unsympathetic to his goals, we're concerned that his violent and overt approach will cause the Empire to strike back even harder against us. Worse, they won't find us - they'll find untrained Force-sensitives who can't defend themselves."*
The holographic recording of Djinn Altis repeats his message once again as Adalyn watches it for the umpteenth time.
*"Our agents have tracked this rogue down to Cypher's Shadowport, where we believe he lays low and takes mercenary jobs between attacks. Adalyn, it falls to you to locate this Jedi. At the very least he must be persuaded to stop his attacks, but ideally we would like you to recruit him. Provided he has not given himself over to the Dark Side."*
It is an unusual mission for her. She is used to locating untrained Force-sensitives, not rogue Jedi. What makes it more unsettling is the worry that terrorist attacks against the Empire sounds like something Khol might do. The chances are infinitesimal of course. But then, a part of her hopes that it is Khol so they can be reunited, no matter the circumstances.
"We have clearance to dock," Kikrin interrupts her thoughts, the verpine pilot looking around at the two women sharing the cockpit, "we will land shortly."
"Are you feeling okay Adalyn?" Alaris asks, the perceptive twi'lek gazing shrewdly at the young Jedi.

Adalyn didn’t need to hear the recording anymore to know what it said; having watched it so many times even Master Djinn’s face had been ingrained in her memory. The message had been an honor in and of itself. It wasn’t often one received a personal message from the head of the Altisian Order, let alone a mission. Over the last couple years she had numerous correspondences with Masters Plett and Camas coordinating their efforts in her self-appointed mission to help escaping Force users. While she felt a sense of duty and took pride in her work, she did have her ulterior motives. One day she hoped it would bring her closer to reuniting with her friends.
As her thoughts shift to Khol and Ash, her worry comes to the surface. Something must have shown on her expression and clicking the holo recording off she does her best to school her expression. Giving Alaris a reassuring smile the young Jedi waves away her concern, “**Nothing I can’t handle. Eager to get this over with.**” A part of her doesn't dare admit the hope that maybe, just maybe Khol was behind it. The fear growing that if he had lost himself to the dark forces she had sensed in him when they had parted she may have truly lost him.
Looking out the viewport Adalyn gazes out at their destination. “**What do we know about the shadowport?**” she asks to draw her companions attention away from her growing unease.

Adalyn is familiar with the brief that came with Master Djinn's message, and it is this information that Alaris immediately reels off from memory. The distraction tactic has apparently worked.
"Like others of its kind, Cypher's Shadowport was formed by smugglers, pirates, and other criminals who forged a community outside govermental jurisdiction where they have the freedom to engage in the kind of activities frowned on in civilised space. We can expect to encounter the open trade of drugs, black market goods, and possibly even slaves. Cypher's Shadowport is also famous in certain circles for its gladiatorial arena. Apparently they are quite brutal, and while killing is not strictly allowed accidental deaths occur all too often. Cypher is an actual person but he remains quite illusive. To be in charge of a shadowport he must have influential ties, but nobody seems to know who's backing him. The population of the shadowport is at least five thousand but it's impossible to get an exact number because of all the coming and going."
"As for this rogue Jedi," she adds as a final note, "we don't think he's connected with Cypher but we can't be sure exactly what sort of activities he's involved in. It's possible he's only at the shadowport to hide, it's a better place than most."

### **Alicia** (2012-03-27 17:04:47)

Adalyn nods in her agreement to Alaris’s assessment of the rogue Jedi’s reason for being on the station. If she was alone and needed a place to hide, she might have tried to make her way to someplace like this. Here where there were outlaws living together with a common purpose to remain apart from the Empire. Perfect place for a terrorist to hide and even get his supplies, and because it was a port there was always transportation.
Leaning against the arm rest of her chair, she lets her chin fall into her left hand as she contemplates their plan of action. On a station of over five thousand outlaws who probably wouldn’t take kindly to strangers asking questions they were going to have to tread lightly. For a moment she debated reaching out with the Force to help her, letting it guide her to the rogue Jedi, but a part of her was apprehensive about letting him know she was there before she could even trace him through menial means.
Not only was she going to have dodge detection by the rogue but hope she doesn’t draw any other unwanted attention either. All of this and more crosses her thoughts as she waits for the *N'kidix* to finish docking.

The YT-100 descends onto a vacant landing pad with more grace than its appearance would belie. At a push of a button Kikrin releases the landing struts and brings his vessel to a gentle stop.
"Looks like we have a greeting party," Alaris observes, staring out of the cockpit at group of armed aliens approaching the transport.
Kikrin clicks quietly, a gesture the others recognise as indifference.
"They are here to collect the docking fee. Places like this, they like payment up front."
The Verpine joins the women as they walk through the ship, taking a blaster rifle from a rack by the ramp. Alaris, already carrying her equipment, presses the release and the ramp descends.
The group waiting at the bottom comprises of a trio of Gran, a burly Trandoshan, and a Devaronian male. Despite his demonic looks the latter is the least physically threatening of the group and it's no surprise when he turns out to be spokesperson.
"Welcome to Cypher's Shadowport," he says, "we represent the port authority. Are you here for business or for pleasure?"
"I have no cargo to trade," Kikrin replies, "just these two passengers."
The Devaronian nods.
"There's just the matter of your docking and refueling fees."
"Of course," says Kikrin, "I will be happy to discuss it with you. May my passengers go about their business?"
The Devaronian grins widely and reveals his sharpened teeth, throwing his arm around Kikrin's shoulders.
"I see no reason to keep them."
The pair walk away, the Devaronian guiding Kikrin towards his office. His guards linger a while longer, treating the girls to some exceptionally unfriendly expressions, then peel away and leave them be.
Alaris watches their friend go with concern, but moments later the Twi'lek is all business as she turns to Adalyn.
"Our agent lost track of the target not far from here. Apparently he went into a cantina called the Greasy Gear and somehow slipped out unseen. That seems the place to start."

### **Alicia** (2012-03-27 22:47:44)

Adalyn watches Kikrin walk off with the Devaronian dock keeper as well, but she knew he probably wouldn’t have done so unless he believed it necessary or if he couldn’t handle himself. Knowing he would either stay with the ship or meet up with them later she turns her attention back to Alaris.
Nodding her agreement, she starts heading toward the exit. “**Greasy Gear it is. Hopefully we can make use of any other details the agent sent us, before we start arousing suspicions.**” While not drawing heavily on the Force, she keeps her attention sharp, using its influence to heighten her senses.

Cypher's Shadowport might be a wretched hive of scum and villainy, but it is surprisingly well organised and maintained. In amongst the myriad people thronging its streets a small army of repair droids work to keep the place operational while cleaning droids tirelessly sweep surfaces clean of litter, spills, and... is that a scorch mark?
Alaris' intel proves accurate and the Greasy Gear is not far at all from the landing pad. Nor is it particularly difficult to spot, sporting a giant holographic sign of a rotating gear dripping grease.
Inside, the cantina proves less well kept than the shadowport proper. Whoever owns it is clearly less interested in hygiene. Or replacing broken bulbs. In the dim, flickering light ominous figures in dark clothing loom all around, and it is suddenly all too easy to remember the nature of the station and the people who dwell there.
Serving droids weave their way through the bustle, bringing drink orders back and forth from the bar at the far end of the room where a Quarren chats conspiritorially with a pair of cloaked customers.

Glad for the muted, dark color of her cloak, Adalyn could only hope that in the dim light her red hair wouldn’t attract attention as they entered the cantina. In an effort to hide it, she draws her hood up. With a glance around, her gaze falls on the two cloaked beings and with a sideways glance to Alaris she begins heading in further toward the back of the cantina to the bar.
Taking an available table near the three conspiratorial figures she uses the excuse of signaling one of the droids to get a better look at the cloaked figures and attempt to overhear what they may be talking about.

The trio seem to be bartering the price of a spice shipment, and while they are talking quietly and being careful not to give away any details that might lead any of the other criminals in the bar to their bounty, they seem heedless of the fact they might be overheard. After all, spice is business as usual at the Shadowport.
Eventually a price is agreed, to be paid "in the usual way", and the cloaked duo walk away from the bar. As they pass Adalyn's table she sees the taller of the two is a grim-faced Thakwaash and the other a near-human with a cybernetic eye.
In the meantime one of the serving droids has made its way over and taken drinks orders for herself and her companion. Alaris seems completely at ease in the cantina, but Adalyn knows her well enough to see that she is as alert for danger as ever. If anything happens, she can rely on Ranger Odula to react quickly.
The Quarren bustles about behind the bar mixing drinks for the droids to deliver. Now he isn't distracted by conversation the orders are completed with much more efficiency and it isn't long before the droid is back at the table with the girls' orders.
Alaris takes a sip of her beer and then asks: "any ideas?"

It’s perhaps a testament to the variety of missions Adalyn has been on that she manages to mimic her companion’s countenance. Sipping her own beer, she takes another look around the cantina, continually being wary of her surroundings particularly in this den of outlaws. Not knowing where to start other than their current location, or who to start with they were left with limited options.
“**Well**,” she starts, drawing it out. “**We can hope our good friend realizes we’re here… or I can attempt to locate our new friend through *other* means. The best course might be to just be patient and wait.**” The last she points out with a slight shrug of her shoulders.

Alaris settles back in her chair, swilling her beer around in the glass. She sits mostly in silence, occasionally speaking up to make polite conversation. About twenty minutes after their drinks arrive Kikrin comms to let them know the fees are all settled, and he'll stay with the ship until called for.
Slightly less than an hour later Adalyn suddenly registers a discrepancy at the edge of her senses, a feeling that she recognises as the touch of the Force. It disappears almost as soon as she detects it as though being actively hidden, but it is enough to know there is another Force-sensitive in the cantina. Looking up she sees a human female in a burgundy dress has just entered. In spite of the dim lighting she wears dark glasses and doesn't seem in a hurry to take them off.
The woman advances toward the bar, where she orders an Alderaanian Sunrise. When she has the drink in hand she turns and moves without hesitation to Adalyn's table, taking a seat without asking.
"Hello Adalyn, Alaris," the lady greets them, "where's Kikrin?"
Adalyn's Twi'lek companion shifts in her seat to face the newcomer and raises a painted eyebrow at the stranger's apparent knowledge of the team. She says nothing however, waiting for Adalyn to take the lead.

The touch of the Force is enough to have the young Jedi on edge and it’s only the appearance of the strange woman that the feeling abates, however only slightly. Adalyn’s instincts told her this was the agent who had passed on the intel concerning the rogue Jedi. Not knowing who this woman was she decided to still play this cautiously.
“**Keeping watch of the ship.**” Taking her time she sips at the last dregs of her beer, having nursed it to the Quarren barkeep’s consternation for the past hour. “**I’m glad you decided to show yourself. How did you know it would be us?**”

"I make it a point to know as much as I can about everyone I can," the woman replies, adding: "especially when they're people I might meet on a job. I Once I heard that the *N'kidix* had docked I assumed it was you here. After all, it's Kikrin's ship."
Her painted lips twitch upward in a smile, and she leans forward as she introduces herself.
"I'm Layni. Good to meet you."

### **Alicia** (2012-03-29 19:05:31)

With a nod, Adalyn affirms Layni’s reasoning. “**Pleasure,**” the young Jedi responds and after finishing off her beer, leans forward as well. “**Pleasantries aside, you know why we’re here.** ” While they spoke she decides to test her theory and careful reaches out in the Force encompassing the small space around them to affirm whether it was Layni she felt on the edge of her senses.

As Adalyn begins probing with the Force Layni hisses "stop that" at her, which is confirmation of her suspicions in and of itself. Not only is Layni Force-sensitive but she has control enough of her innate powers to detect Adalyn's attempt.
"Save it for when you have to," the agent advises, "you never know who is watching."
Ranger Odula glances between them, not sensing what has just taken place but knowing enough to comprehend the gist.
"She is right Adalyn," the twi'lek agrees, "until we've exhausted any leads Layni can give us there's no sense in taking unnecessary risks."
Layni takes a petite sip of her cocktail, relaxing back into her chair.
"If you must have an explanation, then here it is," she explains, "I'm a Miraluka. If you know anything about my species you will know that I do possess the talents you suspect me of."
Pointing to her dark glasses, she adds: "you will also know that I'm incapable of giving you a good physical description of your target as I don't see the way you do. I can tell you that he is male, and around 2 metres in height. He wore a bulky cloak and a wide-brimmed hat. As for details like colour, that is beyond the limitations of my senses."
"Since he disappeared in here the first time I've been spending a lot of time here, ingratiating myself with the owner. Turns out this guy comes in here every now and then, mostly to meet people. Possibly employers or co-conspirators. There's one person he meets who's a regular here. A Kubaz by the name of Thatrik. Keep him under observation, and you may eventually find your man."

### **Alicia** (2012-03-30 11:07:49)

Hardly put off by Layni’s warnings, the young Jedi ceases her attempt to sense the agent. The outburst revealed itself to be a good sign making it unnecessary. As Layni continues to explain the pieces begin to fall together. There had been a great many Miraluka who served as teachers and administrators in the Order. Her thoughts are interrupted as the agent proceeds into her report and she’s hardly surprised by the lack of news in regards to who he is. A bulky cloak and the hat were the perfect cover to throw off any cursory glances and anyone looking at him too intently he probably would have noticed.
At the mention of the Kubaz, Adalyn takes a moment to see if he is present in the cantina before turning her attention bake to the agent. “**When was the last time our man was here?**”

The Miraluka sets her glass down while replying: "not since that first time, but the Kubaz has been coming in often lately. I think he's waiting for someone to show - maybe our man, maybe not."
Reaching up casually with her right hand, Layni brushes some stray hair behind her ear then casually touches the arm of her shades as though adjusting how they sit on her face. Moments later she reaches out to Adalyn.
"Do you have any idea who it might be?" she asks conversationally, touching the young Jedi's hand. When their fingers part a micro datachip is sitting in Adalyn's palm.
"Everything I have on Thatrik," she murmurs.

Drawing her hand away, the young woman doesn’t give the chip a second glance. Attempting to keep her features neutral she tries to not let the torrent of thoughts show in her expression as she goes over what she knows of the rogue. With each clue she got closer to suspecting it might be Khol. How tall had he been when she last saw him and still growing. She has to remind herself while uncommon men could be so tall.
“**No**,” she replies simply to the question. “**Only suspicions and I rather not suppose.**” With a nod she thanks Layni for the information. “**Would you like us to keep you apprised?**” With a glance over at her Twi'lek companion she gives a nod indicating they would be leaving soon.

"You can contact me if you need me," Layni replies quietly, "call me if you think you've found wherever he's hiding. After all, he won't be able to hide from me."
Leaving the rest of her cocktail untouched the Miraluka pushes back her chair and rises to her feet. Alaris stands too and shakes the other woman's hand. Then the twi'lek leans across the table toward Adalyn as Layni leaves the cantina.
"It seems the kubaz is our only lead right now unless you want to wait around hoping our guy will show," she comments, adding: "I guess we'd better go somewhere private to look at the file. I hope we don't miss him in the meantime."

### **Alicia** (2012-04-03 09:53:42)

Giving the Miraluka agent a small salute in farewell as she leaves, Adalyn waits for the woman to leave. As Layni leans over the table to speak to the young Jedi, she stands and looks toward the door. She had voiced a concern she is considering as well, but she doubts the Twi’lek would like her alternative. “**One of us could remain here, but that hardly seems prudent. We’ll just have to risk it and come back soon,**” she says, dismissing it even as she tells it to Alaris. Splitting up never turns out well, to that she has first experience. Smoothing the folds of her cloak Adalyn pockets the chip. “**Best we head back to the ship.**”

Alaris nods her agreement and waits for Adalyn to rise before leaving the cantina. They are allowed to leave unmolested by the clientele, although Adalyn is perceptive enough to realise that eyes are following them to the door. Whether the intent behind them is lecherous, sinister, or merely curious she cannot say.
Their short journey back to the ship is uneventful and they find Kikrin sitting just inside the open cargo ramp, waiting patiently for their return.
"It went well?" he queries, glancing from one woman to the other.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-04-03 11:58:30)

On the walk back to the landing pad, she felt unsettled by the glances the two of them had attracted the attention of the patrons. While their intent was still unclear to her, she resolves to be more wary as they come and go from the place. Any one of them could be affiliated with their targets and the last thing they needed was for them to get scared away.
The Verpin is a welcome sight as she boards the ship. "**Well enough,**" Adalyn responds stepping into the cargo hold. Once the ramp has been closed she pulls out the datacard Layni had given her. "**The agent who sent in the initial report found us and gave us some more intel. At least now we have another lead. A Kubaz she says our rogue has been in contact with.**" Not wasting anymore time she uncovers the bracer computer hidden by the sleeve of her cloak and plugs the datacard in.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-04-03 12:31:50)

Layni has compiled a small data package about Thatrik, including a camera still which shows what he looks like: short for a kubaz at about 1.5 metres, with a light skin tone that is more green than black. It isn't clear in the picture, but an annotation notes that he is meant to be missing a finger on his right hand.
Like others of his species he is an accomplished spy and his main source of income is as an information broker. It is possible that finding out about the mysterious Jedi might be as simple as paying Thatrik enough money.
He is not known to have any family locally, nor any particularly close friends. His home address is listed, with a note from Layni indicating that he is rumoured to have an excellent security system as well as security guards in his employ. Something of a necessity, considering where he lives and his line of work.
Other information includes known associates and business connections. He seems quite well connected in the Shadowport, with investments in a number of stores and import/export companies. None immediately jumps out as overly interesting or suspicious, but perhaps that's only because they don't know what to look for. However, Layni notes that if it proves necessary threatening one or more of the kubaz' business interests might be a way to get him to cooperate.
Lastly, the Miraluka notes that the only pastime he seems to enjoy outside the privacy of his own home are the gladiatorial matches the shadowport is famous for.

### **Alicia** (2012-04-03 13:31:14)

Adalyn glances over the information frowning at the display as she sorts it into something which would prove useful. If it came down to it, she had some funds she could use to bribe the Kubaz for what they wanted, but it wouldn't hurt to have a backup plan. "**We should scope out his businesses, see what we can learn to our benefit should efforts to 'convince' him to assist us prove fruitless. His home is probably too secure to accomplish anything there, but it won't hurt to take a look if we can avoid arousing suspicion.**" She copies the data to her computer and hands over the chip to the others.
"**Might prove worthwhile to look into the matches to see if it's a viable option for a confrontation.**" Realizing they had a great deal of work to do, they each would have to concentrate on where their strengths laid. She waits for her two companions to voice up where they wanted to start.

### **simplyscribed** (2012-04-03 17:33:28)

Kikrin shrugs and makes that clicking noise again.
"It might be hard to damage Thatrik's business concerns," the Verpine says, "we cannot blackmail him by uncovering illegalities, it is a shadowport. We could perhaps sabotage them, but do we want to risk it? He must be clever to be successful in a place such as this, with so many rivals nipping at his heels. If we are caught in hostile action against him there is no plan B. We will be his enemies and our lead will be gone."
Meanwhile Alaris takes the chip, secreting it in a compartment of her utility belt. The Twi'lek listens to Kikrin and nods to herself, lekku writhing absently.
"I want to check out the arena," she says, glancing at Adalyn, her expression thoughtful.
"The Kubaz might be there," she offers as an explanation, "and if not people there must know him."

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-04-03 18:46:16)

Listening intently she realizes the Verpine has a point. It would be hard to blackmail the Kubaz and harder still to disrupt his businesses without making an enemy of him, and above all they needed him to cooperate. That left hoping they could come up with an adequate bribe or be lucky enough to have the Kubaz lead them to the rogue. "**Let's keep our eyes and ears open at least. Maybe something concerning an opponent might present itself to our advantage. Knowledge in any form could tip the scales in our negotiations with Thatrik.**"
Adjusting the sleeve of her cloak, she smooths the fabric out. "**I'll go with you. It would be beneficial to have back up nearby and we both might be able to pursue different avenues.**" With a glance at Kikrin she waits to see if he has any objections to the plan. "**Unless you want to continue keeping the engines hot, a stake out in the cantina might be in order. Sure you could work some magic there.**"

"I was about to suggest I wait at the Greasy Gear," Kikrin agreeably replies.
"I am sure the ship will be safe in our absence, whatever else may happen at shadowports the station staff cannot afford to gain a reputation among captains for being untrustworthy. They and their credits would go elsewhere."

Nodding in agreement, Adalyn turns toward the ramp not wasting anymore words. They all knew to be careful, to cover their tracks. None of them would have survived this long if they hadn't. She spares a glance over at Alaris to make sure the Twi'lek was ready before pressing the ramp release. Drawing the hood up over her hair once more she sets a leisurely pace toward the gladiatorial arena.

Alaris follows and Kikrin is the last out of his ship. The three of them leave the bay together and then the Verpine peels off toward the Greasy Gear.
The arena is not particularly difficult to find; as the Shadowport's premier attraction it is well signposted. When they arrive they find it is quite a spectacle - unlike the areas of the station which they have passed through, which were either brightly lit interior passages or in some rare cases roofed by screens showing scenes of daylit skies, the area above the great coliseum-like structure is exposed to the stars through a dome of glassteel. The arena itself is large, capable of seating at least the entire population of the port with some extra space beside. Based on the sparse crowds it doesn't seem likely it is anywhere near packed today however.
Approaching a gate, Adalyn and Alaris discover there is an entry fee of thirty credits a head. A board nearby lists the scheduled matches and the current odds, in case they want to place any bets before even entering.

### **Alicia** (2012-04-05 09:54:25)

Adalyn is impressed by the sight of the arena itself. The designers had apparently taken great care to make the arena impressive in its own right, the glass dome ceiling rising above them the most impressive display of all. Paying for both of their entry fees, Adalyn makes a point of looking over the scheduled matches, not so much out of an interest in the matches but in the appearance of it. She does however take not of any of the high odds betting assuming those might be the most interesting and would be the most likely to attract the Kubaz.
Making mental notes of what she finds she heads in through the gates.

The schedule shows that earlier matches are purely for entertainment purposes: one-off concept battles, grudge matches, fights betweens gladiators and beasts and team battles. These battles do have listed odds, though in most cases the difference between competitors odds is not so substantial to make one seem a sure thing. However in one case, "Bloody Binks" is listed as going up against something called a Szari Dune Beast and the odds do not favour him at all.
Later battles are set up in tournament style, and apart from the initial match-ups odds aren't listed since these will depend on who advances from round to round until one of them faces off against the reigning champion, a gladiator billed as the "Crazed Zakkeg".
The board also provides a local HoloNet address where customers can bet online at their leisure between matches, a helpful convenience since odds will only become available for many of the matches minutes before they occur.
After Adalyn pays she and Alaris find themselves walking through a tunnel into a vast hall under the stands. Here under the arena a crowd mills around concession stands and climb a number of large stairwells to the seats above. Checking their tickets, the girls see that they have assigned seats: Block D, Q186 and Q187 in the First Circle. After that it is a simple matter of following the signposts to their exit.
Topside, they are greeted with the spectacle of the ampitheatre's interior, dozens of concentric rows arranged in three larger Circles, the third of which seems dizzyingly far from the arena floor from where they stand and uncomfortably close to the stars seen through the dome. Nobody is sitting up there today though, in fact so far only the seats of the First Circle are filling up. For the benefit of people sitting further back, a system of large screens has been set up. Some on the walls of the arena itself, others hovering above the stands.
Alaris whistles at the sight of it.
"Whoever built this place sure wanted it to make a statement," comments the Twi'lek, impressed. She looks around her to work out where they are in relation to the rows and points behind them, slightly further up.
"We're standing by J so Q must be this way," the Ranger reasons and leads the way to row Q and along it to their assigned seats where they find themselves sitting by a humanoid in a cloak and mask. In front of them a party of young Rodian males jokes together.
Attached to the seats directly in front are sets of electrobinoculars, just in case an audience member doesn't want to watch the whole thing on the screens. Rental is 5 credits.

Adalyn is distracted as she walks, the name of the reigning champ reminding her of the Charging Zakkeg clan. It’s been awhile since she’s seen the growing younglings, the apprenticeship under Master Ruhk making them grow up even faster. Thinking of them brings on a pang of homesickness.
The sight of the arena’s interior brings her out of her thoughts. Impressed as well she can’t help but cast glances around at the structure while she follows the Twi’lek to their seats. Adjusting her cloak around her, she takes her seat casting a furtive glance at the masked figure next to them.
Wanting to sate her curiosity, she accesses the local HoloNet on her computer bracer and does a search for the pseudonym “Crazed Zakkeg”. While the search runs she leans in toward her companion. “**It’s going to be hard to find him in this throng. For all we know he has a private booth.**”

"If he has a private booth it might actually be easier," Alaris replies as she pays 5 credits and takes the elctrobinoculars from in front of her.
Searching for the Crazed Zakkeg on the HoloNet Adalyn discovers an official site for the arena on which he has a profile page. Topping off the page is a picture of a large and muscular man in a stylised zakkeg mask, with thumbnails linking to several stills and video clips of him fighting. The page also lists a comprehensive overview of his battle stats. Since his debut this martial artist has had very few losses, explaining why he is the current champion.
At the side of the page is a widget which lists the top five fighters. The Crazed Zakkeg is obviously at the top, but according to this another fighter that goes by the name of Fever is nipping right at his heels. Following them are fighters known as Torrek, Huntress, and Wrath.

With her curiosity sated, Adalyn puts her computer bracer in standby and pays for the set of electrobinoculars in front of her. Using the matches as an excuse she takes a section of the stands and begins to comb through them looking for the Kubaz. If she finds where the private boxes are she concentrates efforts there, in the hopes Thatrik was there, but doubting he would make an appearance till the bigger matches start.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-04-09 19:07:38)

Adalyn has no luck picking Thatrik out from the crowds, but she does locate the private boxes close to the arena floor which are for the most part empty today. The handful of wealthy looking sentients sitting there all seem to know each other - no surprises there, really. They chatter amongst themselves as the battles begin.
Each battle is slightly different, with different environments and conditions imposed on the fighters.
Despite the respectable veneer of the arena and it's professional set-up, the battles prove to be no less violent than underground clubs on civilised worlds. Here there is no law as such, which makes a scene that would otherwise be incredibly illegal merely big business. As the fights go on, participants are seriously injured. The only thing that seems to be against the rules is killing, but leaving an opponent broken and screaming their agony to the jeers of the crowd is fair game.
However, deaths do happen. Szari Dune Beasts don't know the rules after all, and the Gungan warrior Bloody Binks truly had no chance against the great worm-like predator. What he was was doing fighting it, the girls will probably never know, but they won't quickly forget the sight of it erupting from the sand beneath the Gungan to swallow him whole.
After the sand is drained from the arena floor the day's tournament battles begin. The best of the arena's fighters and the most glory hungry compete against each other for the opportunity to take the Crazed Zakkeg's title. Three of the other top fighters are competing: a brutal Trandoshan mercenary named Torrek; Huntress, a female humanoid gunslinger in what looks like a battered beskar'gam; and a bloodthirsty Zabraki who goes by the moniker Wrath. All three are competent, easily passing the early rounds. The number two fighter, Fever, is noticeably absent. Also absent, at least as far as Adalyn is able to tell, is their target. Thatrik has not yet appeared in the VIP boxes, and if he's in the crowd proper it seems unlikely that they'll be able to pick him out from the throng.

While the fights hold no real interest to the young Jedi. *How barbaric* Her gaze does end up on the field of battle more often than not before she continues her search of the stands. "**It's like searching for a needle,**" she complains idly to herself, and the electrobinoculars fall to her lap as she takes a break from her search. She let's her chin fall into her cybernetic hand as her elbow props up on the arm rest. Taking to watching those near her, she tries to come up with another plan.
Sitting and waiting for the Kubaz to show was getting them no where fast and there wasn't even a guarantee Thatrik would even sit in the VIP section. Just the assumption he was important and wealthy enough to not sit among the common throng.
It came down to the fact the young woman was losing her patience.

"Relax Adalyn," her companion gently chides her, "did you think we would solve all our problems in a day and get to go home? This was always a long shot. I admit I didn't think the arena would be this big though."
The Twi'lek puts down her own binoculars and glances over at Adalyn.
"You keep watching," she suggests, "and I'll go and question the staff."

### **Alicia** (2012-04-11 00:14:52)

With a sigh, the young woman follows it with a deep breath regaining her composure. Nodding her agreement she watches the Twi'lek get up and move away from the corner of her eye. After a long moment she gets back to the task at hand of looking for the Kubaz in the VIP booths and then moving onto the almost futile attempt of locating him in the crowd.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-04-19 18:40:25)

While Alaris is absent the battles continue, each becoming more exciting as randomised special rules are put into play. The semi-final match, for instance, is fought with the participants attempting to balance on a network of suspended cables above the arena floor. Falling is a losing condition, and of the two finalists Huntress and Wrath the Zabraki seems at a clear disadvantage, lacking the grace for such a game.
Yet it is he, not Huntress, who makes it through to the final round. When the woman kicks him from his precarious perch, Wrath catches the cable and swings around it into the back of her knees. She hits the ground hard and lies stunned while medics rush to inspect her and Wrath howls his victory to the crowd.
He leaps down amidst the roars and cheers of the crowd as his vanquished foe is removed from the field on a stretcher. After posturing for a minute he too leaves the arena floor.
Then a hush ripples through the crowd as a lone figure emerges from one of the gates. A large, powerful man in a fearsome zakkeg mask.
The crowd remains expectantly silent as Wrath returns wielding a long-handled vibro-axe.
The announcer speaks:
“Wrath advances to the final round and a chance to face our reigning champion, the Crazed Zakkeg! There will be no special rules for the final bout. Victory depends on combat excellence alone. Nothing short of a knock-out will end this match! BEGIN!”
The fight is something to see. Though Wrath's style is all fury and impulse, his boundless energy and his reach weapon make it difficult for the champion to close. And yet the pole-axe is useless against the Crazed Zakkeg, who ducks, weaves, and leaps around it as though he can sense the weapon coming long before a strike lands. When it comes too close to avoid he simply deflects it with well placed unarmed strikes to the handle, taking the opportunity to come in closer to his foe and get under Wrath's guard.
In this way the champion begins to wear the Zabraki down, and in his frustration Wrath becomes even more reckless, his swings wilder, the flaws in his guard more pronounced. When he shows his weakness, the Zakkeg bares his fangs. He comes in under the pole-axe and knocks the weapon aside with a casual strike, his other hand hitting Wrath hard in the solar plexus. As the Zabraki doubles over, the Crazed Zakkeg strikes him hard on the jaw, instantly knocking him out.
The crowd erupt, though there is as much booing as cheering. Clearly many had hoped the Crazed Zakkeg would be toppled from his throne today, and had money riding on it. The victor stands silently throughout it all until the announcer speaks once again:
“Today we are proud to announce a special event. Is there any warrior in the crowd brave enough to face the Crazed Zakkeg?”
This announcement is greeted by a lot of hubbub, then an Ithorian booms out “We want Fever!” with all his throats.
His call is taken up by many. The fact that Fever was absent from the games does not seem to prevent the crowd from wanting the most anticipated match-up. Of course, Fever may not even be in the crowd. And if so, he doesn't seem in a hurry to respond to the public demand.

The matches leave the young woman on the edge of her seat. While brutal, there was something about them that prevented her from looking away. She never thought such a barbaric sport would interest her so, having witnessed battles first hand it was an entirely different matter to see a facsimile put forth as entertainment. Maybe it was the thrill of experiencing it from the stands, and not being an active participant in the melee. Surely the competitors were willing participants.
As the final match comes to an end and the call for Fever grows louder she takes that opportunity to open her com to Alaris and Kikrin. “**I hope you’re having more fun than I am?**” she asks, using her binoculars to look through the VIP stands once more as she waits for a response.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-04-21 19:23:01)

For a while there is no response at all, then after some seconds Alaris finally replies.
*"I wouldn't use the word fun, but I've got some news,"* The Twi'lek reports, *"Thatrik is definitely in the arena. Apparently he always gets his snacks from the same counter and the guy swears he's here today. I also found out that he usually does sit in the VIP stand - likes to make a big fuss about how important he is so pretty much everyone knows. If he's in the arena but not in his usual spot, he might not be here to watch the matches today.*"

“**Which means he’s likely conducting business behind closed doors,**”Adalyn finishes for the Twi’lek. “**I doubt he'd be far from the kiosk… Let’s meet up; where are you?**” Putting the binoculars away, she gets ready to meet up with her.

### **simplyscribed** (2012-04-23 14:23:44)

*"Meet me in the food court, at the bottom of the stairs,"* Alaris suggests before breaking comm contact.
As Adalyn makes her way from her seat the crowd finally relent, Fever is obviously not coming and no other member of the public seems insane enough to take the challenge. The Crazed Zakkeg leaves the arena with no ceremony and there is a sudden surge of movement toward the stairs.
As she finds herself swept up in the crowd, Adalyn is aware of a sudden sense of impending danger but it is too late. A split second later she feels an object pressed against her back and a male voice pitched deliberately low tells her "Keep walking."

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-04-23 14:38:48)

Mentally, Adalyn berates herself for letting her guard down, but outwardly she remains calm. Taking a step forward so does as the man wants, but as she does so she takes a risk and opens herself to form a telepathic connection with Alaris. *Caught* is all she says before breaking the connection, not wanting to risk anything more pronounced. If Alaris was safe then the Twi’lek would find her. If not, then the young Jedi is reassured by the fact the Ranger has a good head on her shoulders. Until then, she will play along with the man. After all a scene here is the last thing she wants and maybe, just maybe this man would lead her to what she does. She just has to get him alone.
Taking her time as she takes a step and then another, she casts a look back to gauge her would be assailant, the action hopefully hiding the activation of her hands free com in her attempt to reestablish her line with Alaris.

Adalyn is physically incapable of bending her neck so far she can see the person standing directly behind her, but she learns a few things: first, he is tall. Second, he is broad shouldered. And third, he's wearing one of the ubiquitous dark cloaks so common in this Force-forsaken station.
"Face forward," her kidnapper advises almost cordially, "and remember sudden movements will not end well. As for anything else you may feel like attempting, or have already attempted... Do not risk it. I know you're wearing a hands-free. Take it off and hold it out so I can see it."
His voice grows quieter, as he continues:
"I expect you doubt me but this is for your own good. Just be silent and sensible for now."

Holding in her sigh, Adalyn does as instructed reaching up to her ear and removing the device. To outsmart this guy she was going to have to be smarter. Thankfully for her, she estimated to she could absorb a couple shots if it came down to that.
"If you wanted me to be sensible there are other ways to go about it," she says conversationally. Holding the com in her left hand she waits for him to take the next move. "You seem to have the advantage, knowing about me but I know little of you."

Her captor doesn't rise to the bait.
As the crowd emerges in the food court, Adalyn realises she can't see Alaris but at this point that could mean anything. Maybe the Twi'lek is also captured. Maybe she's setting up am ambush. Maybe she plans to sneakily follow them. Maybe she's going to find Kikrin and plan a later rescue. There are too many possibilities to make any assumptions right now.
With no help available she has no choice but to allow the man to lead her out of the arena. Several streets away, when they are no longer in quite such a packed throng with ears all around, he seems more comfortable speaking again.
"You must leave the shadowport," he advises, "or less gentle men than me will come for you."

"**You know… we were getting along so well, and you want me to leave already?**" the young woman says lightly. "**Why is that?**" If she had attracted this man's attention she guessed she was getting close to what she was looking for. No one threatened another unless they had something to hide.

"As of half a galactic standard hour ago when the bounty went out, you're worth more to the scum of this station dead than alive," the stranger informs her, then says something else that sends icy chills through her heart: "your friends are probably already dead."
"I don't want you dead. But certain people are watching me. They no doubt think I'm taking you somewhere quiet to execute you; even here, murder on the street can get you in hot water you know.'
"So here's what we do," the man continues, "we go down the next alley and you bolt. You get the hell back to your ship and you get out of here before anyone has a chance to stop you. I'll make up a story about losing you and take my chances. Deal?"

The thought her friends may be dead sets Adalyn's heart racing. They hadn't been on the station a day and already they have found more trouble than they were expecting. One thing is for sure, she isn't going to leave her friends when their fate is unknown. That is one mistake she has no intention of repeating. "**I'm not leaving,**" Adalyn says resolutely. "**Not without them. If you want to help me, then help me find them.**"

The pressure of the gun on her back eases as they turn into an alley, just like the man said they would.
"This is where you break free of me," he says, "but whether you go to your ship or elsewhere that's the end of my involvement. I have my own problems."
His tone is not without sympathy however, indicating that the choice not to help does seem to be a hard one.
Free to turn around, Adalyn discovers somewhat to her surprise that her "captor" is the masked humanoid who had been sitting close to Alaris and herself back at the arena. With the mask and cloak combined it is very hard to tell anything about him other than those things that are most obvious and she already knows: the fact he is male for instance, and a confirmation that while he is definitely shorter than Khol his height is still way above average. The pistol in his hand is no longer pointed directly at her.
"Get out of here," he urges, "before they come."

Released from the threat of his blaster she immediately turns to face him. The surprise lasted only a moment as the familiar facade comes into view. Eerily yet now she could see him in full was the similarities to the one she had come to find; broad shouldered, tall. Under a bulky and a hat, Layni never did get much of a description. It could be anyone.
It doesn’t stop Adalyn though from asking questions: How much had he heard? What does he know?
"**Who put the bounty out? Why help me?**" she asks quickly. There is so much she wants to know, but she doubts she has any time.

"You have no idea how dangerous these people are," the stranger replies, "digging into Thatrik was a mistake. The Wire -"
He stops abruptly, startled by a noise behind him. Though it is impossible to see his expression through his mask, the mystery man's voice is anxious.
"Go! If you won't leave then find somewhere to lie low, change your appearance. Trust *no one*."
Raising his pistol he fires once, the bolt burning past to her left and scorching the wall.
"You ran, I missed. *Go!*"

Time was out. Taking a step backwards, she prepares herself to run. "Thank you," she says in a low voice before turning on her heel and making a run for it down the alley way. As she draws further from her would be captor turned savior she calls on the Force to speed her movements and to guide her steps to a safe path much like she did years ago when her world had flipped upside down. While he had told her to trust no one, she has to trust herself or she will be completely lost.
Her first order was to find somewhere to hide, recoup before moving on. With only a few days supplies, only the Force trance would help her survive past that. There was also her friends. If they're still alive she would rather know sooner rather than later, which means accessing the shadowport's systems or trying to reach them with the Force. Both options risky.
Shaking her head she settles on a list of priorities: somewhere to hide and then something to disguise herself with.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Not being in rounds I'll just continually use surge moving through back ways when possible. Otherwise, she doesn't have anywhere specific in mind other than somewhere safe.
Consider her using *search your feelings* to mark a safe way, taking 10 for 24 total.
You missed my wonderful idea of trying to use Illusion to fake Adalyn's death but I talked myself out of it.

As Adalyn scarpers she hears a shouted conversation from the alley behind her, then three thugs emerge into the road after her, running hard in her direction. The argument in the alley continues before it is interrupted by gunshots followed by a high pitched scream. One of her three pursuers falters and shouts for the others to go on as he turns back.
As fast as they're running, the men on her tail can't keep up with her Force-enhanced speed and after after she puts a few obstacles and sharp turns in their path Adalyn soon leaves them behind.
Her senses tell her that she needs to get out of the public eye, and urged on by her feelings she plunges down another alleyway, which she discovers forks between buildings. When it forks again she realises she has found herself in a part of the station that is more densely built up, where the twists and turns will help her to disappear.
Slowing down, Adalyn begins to walk again as though she has nothing to hide. As she keeps an eye on her surroundings to make sure she keeps her bearings, the young Jedi spots a sign outside an unassuming doorway advertising "Fortunes told, Fates unravelled". She feels drawn to that doorway.

The scream has her rattled and for a moment she almost turns back. Had someone been shot in her place? Self preservation kicks in, however, and she doesn't stop and soon the young woman is glad to leave the thugs behind her. When she is confident she has lost her pursuers she slows and takes a better look around at her surroundings, glad that once again her faith in the Force hadn't led her astray. Upon spotting the fortune teller's door she stops, and slowly makes her way toward it. With only another moment of hesitation, she lets herself in her senses on full alert.

Adalyn steps through the doorway and down a short, narrow flight of stairs into the dimily lit and heavily perfumed shop interior. She is in a small room, decorated more like a living space than a place of work. Chests, drawers, pictures, and knick-knacks all contrive to make the atmosphere comforting and homely. In the middle of the room, a woman sits at the opposite edge of a hexagonal table. She wears a beautifully patterned crimson robe with tassles that completely cover her eyes.
"Adalyn?" the fortune teller asks, surprised.
Adalyn recognises the voice. It is Layni.

Kikrin wanted to go back to the cantina to keep an out for Thatrik and Alaris and I decided to check out the arena see if we could find him there. After awhile of being there with no trace of him Alaris went to see what she could learn. It was soon after that I think the bounty went up. I was going to meet her when a man sitting near us forced me out of the arena with the rest of the throng. Thankfully I was able to escape from him and I found myself here.**" Deciding it was best to leave the true involvement of the stranger out of the story, she goes with what she hopes is the common story her 'captor' would use.

"We can do nothing for your friends until we know what actually happened to them," the informant announces, "I will have to make enquiries. Of course it goes without saying you will have to abandon your original objective, it's too dangerous for you here now. And you need a disguise..."

Agreeing with the Miraluka's assessment Adalyn just simply nods. While she would like to complete her original mission her friends' lives and hers were more important. Anything beyond that would be the will of the Force. "**It's probably a good thing I'm somewhere where masks and obscure clothing are the norm. Shouldn't make a disguise too difficult.**" Glancing up at the Miraluka she braves a smile, though the pit in her stomach prevents her from truly feeling it. "**Thank you, Layni.**"

The Miraluka walks over to the steps up to the street. Set on the wall near the stairwell is a lock interface, which she uses to lock up shop.
"Come with me," she says, gliding past where Adalyn is sitting toward a door leading into the back of the residence. Beyond is a small hall with several other doorways. Layni goes through the one on the far right, which turns out to be the entrance to a comfortable bedroom. Unlike the front room it is decorated sparsely. The front room is a place of business of course, and is comfortably appointed for the benefit of the customers. For the sighted. Layni hardly needs decorations to look at.
"So, fancy going blonde?" She asks while opening up a large wardrobe full of clothes, accessories, and even wigs.

### **Alicia** (2012-04-25 09:40:06)

Adalyn watches Layni as she moves to lock up the front and then follows when bidden to the back. "**Still, I would likely be taking more drastic measures at this point without your help.**" As she walks she begins to take off her cloak draping it over her arm upon entering the bedroom. "**Blonde huh. Never really thought about it.**" Looking over the Miraluka's shoulder at the full wardrobe she wonders briefly if the other woman was going to get some perverse satisfaction in playing dress up. She shrugs and decides to let the woman help her as she saw best. "**I think I'd dye my hair at this point if it came to it.**"

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-04-26 03:56:29)

The Miraluka inclines her head in agreement.
"I was thinking dye would be practical myself," she concurs.
"Of course you can wear a hood without looking too unusual around here, but we need to make you less recognisable in case anyone ever does get a look under it. The obvious options are to change hair colour and possibly length, give you contacts, as well as to change the landscape of your face. We can add scars, or false cybernetics. We should also think up a simple cover story for who this new you is and why you're on the station, just in case it comes up.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-04-26 10:49:30)

While not enthused about the prospect of making such changes, particularly considering the pride she had in her hair, Adalyn has to admit it would be the only way to make people less likely to recognize her. "**Sometimes simple solutions work best, so let's not go too overboard. Enough to hold up to scrutiny but not so much it won't be hard to maintain particularly if I'm on my own.**" Taking a seat at the edge of the bed she waits for Layni to give her instructions. In the meantime she thinks over a cover. "**How about, Rayn; a buyer for all things exotic, but not exactly legal.**" She pauses a moment to get Layni's reaction to it before asking, "**Layni, do you know of a man about so tall, broad shouldered and wears a mask?**"

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-04-26 18:09:58)

"Well that cover describes about half the people in the shadowport," Layni observes, "so it should do for you."
The Miraluka busies herself digging around in the bottom of the wardrobe for a large box which turns out to be a costume make-up kit while Adalyn enquires after her mysterious saviour.
"I don't know," she replies, "quite a few of the gladiators wear masks to hide their real identities, but I don't know why one would be in the stands. How did his voice sound? If it was raspy he could be an Ubese. But, well, I mean, a man in a mask could literally be anyone. He might not even be a man."

"**That's true enough I suppose.This particular individual managed to catch me unawares. I doubt our next meeting will turn out so well in my favor.**" Adalyn shrugs. "**I did hear shots and a high pitched scream as I ran away, so something happened after I was out of sight.**"
Watching Layni pull out the box the young woman holds in a sigh. "**Let's get this over with.**"

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-04-26 19:27:38)

By the time Layni is done with her, Adalyn is platinum blonde with pale blue eyes and a long ugly scar curves across one cheek.
"People look at a pretty girl and they want to keep looking," she comments as she puts the finishing touches to this particular bit of fakery, "but they see a disfigured girl and they lose interest. Plus when they look that first time, they won't think "this girl has similar features to the one I'm looking for." They'll just see the scar."
"So," the Miraluka asks as she steps back to the wardrobe, "how does Rayn like to dress? I must have *something* appropriate."
Most of the agent's outfits turn out to either be gorgeous and elaborate like her current crimson robes, or else sexy and seductive (she owns more than her share of slinky dresses, for instance). For some reason she also possesses a set of mechanic's overalls.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-04-26 23:56:03)

Sitting patiently while Layni finishes her artistry, Adalyn tries to think of something other than the massive amount of locks of her own hair that have been collected into a large pile. Adding to the disguise, Adalyn had let Layni cut her hair short, something she normally would never had done, but in light of trying to disappear the young Jedi deemed it necessary. As Layni finishes the scar, Adalyn reaches up to touch to the shortened and dyed strands still not believing she had actually gone through with it.
Standing up, she stretches before following the Miraluka to the wardrobe and looks over the woman's collection of clothing. Looking over the array she tries to determine what might suit her best. While she wanted to remain inconspicuous there was an advantage to drawing some attention. Especially with the facial disguise Layni had so masterfully applied; they would see the scar and nothing more about the face behind it.
Pulling out a revealing top she looks within for a pair of tight pants to go along with it. Though after a moment of consideration it made her wonder how she was going to conceal her lightsaber and her prosthetic. Turning to Layni she raises up her right hand and asks, "**You don't think my prosthetic will give me a way do you?**"

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-04-28 02:10:03)

Layni shrugs dismissively.
"I don't see why - did anyone know about the prosthetic already?" She asks. "I'm guessing you never went out of your way to advertise it. The funny thing about noticeable traits like that is they tend to help hide what would normally be obvious. Same as the scar."
The Miraluka grins.
"I realise my opinion about how you look might not count for a lot but I think you'll be fine. The important thing is to decide who Rayn is and live in her completely."

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-04-28 11:46:18)

Adalyn realizes Layni was right. Whether she could get past this would depend on her ability to not just pretend she was someone else, but be this new person. Her belt and blaster pistol she would reuse, the sight of them common enough, and since they probably didn't take an inventory of her possessions her bracer computer would probably be fine as well. When her fingers wrap around the hilt of the lightsaber, she pauses. The weapon itself could be used as part of her disguise. It's value in some circles was immense and that would be reason enough to want to keep it close. Deciding to ask Layni for a piece of cloth to wrap it in, she sets it aside as well.
Taking the clothing she had found over to the bed she begins to form this new person in her mind as she starts to take of her layers of clothing. With each layer she removes she puts away a bit of Adalyn in her mind for safekeeping. By the time she gets to her underwear she's forgotten about Layni. Dressing in the new clothes, she feels cloaked in the new identity, but there's still a part of her which refuses to let go of herself.

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-04-29 11:08:13)

While Adalyn is doing this, Layni bustles around tidying everything up. Soon there is no evidence at all to show that the makeover has taken place and the Miraluka settles herself down on the end of the bed.
"We shouldn't waste any more time," she advises, "so let's decide what to do. We have two agents unaccounted for, presumed either dead or captured. One was at the arena, which will by now be closed for the day. The other was at a cantina, where we can still gain entry. It makes sense to start with Kikrin."

### **Alicia** (2012-04-30 14:30:16)

"**I agree…**" the transformed woman says, holstering her pistol in her leg holster. Claiming a jacket from the wardrobe she puts the wrapped hilt into one of the inside pockets. A part of her is reassured by its presence. "**I'm ready, lets go.**"

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-04-30 18:37:03)

Before leaving, Layni changes into a burgundy dress, slit up the side to allow ease of movement. She covers her sockets with a cleverly designed visor which looks like a functioning cybernetic modification for visual enhancement.
"This way I'm not the same woman in shades who talked to the human and twi'lek bountyheads here earlier," she comments, "I think being her would be unwise right now, no?"
A short walk later when the pair are in an alley just a few minutes from the Greasy Gear Layni stops Adalyn.
"We should go in separately," the agent suggests. "You make enquiries, pretend like you're interested in the bounties and you heard all three of them were spotted here. That gives you an excuse to be asking awkward questions. I'll just pretend to be a customer and keep my senses tuned. If anyone in the bar reacts suspiciously I'll hopefully catch it."

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-04-30 19:05:51)

Nodding in agreement, Adalyn leaves the alley and makes her way to the Greasy Gear trusting Layni would follow when the Miraluka felt an adequate period has passed. Stepping into the grungy tavern, the young woman heads toward the bar taking in the patrons and making note of any of the ones she recognizes from earlier. While she probably wouldn't approach them directly, they were most likely here when Kilkrin was and that could be useful.

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-05-01 09:41:41)

From what Adalyn can tell, few if any of the people currently in the cantina were also there when she arrived this morning. Certainly the faces she sees at the tables nearest where she and Alaris had sat are unfamiliar ones. She is unsure about those sitting furthest away in the darkest corners, where she can easily imagine a sentinet might lurk all day conducting their illict business. She hadn't seen these folk earlier, and wouldn't know if they were potential witnesses without making enquiries. The Quarren behind the bar is the same one who was there before. To help deal with the increased business as the day passes, he has been joined by a thin dark-skinned Zabraki girl.

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-05-01 10:15:54)

Adalyn has to push away a tinge of disappointment that she doesn't recognize anyone, and as she walks toward the bar she doesn't give any of the others much more than a cursory glance. Leaning against the bar she waits till she gets the Zabraki girl's attention before ordering a Tattooine sunrise. After paying for the drink she lingers for a moment, stirring the concoction and taking a sip.
She decides on some small talk to break the ice. "**Busy night?**" she asks glancing out at the patrons scattered through the tavern.

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-05-01 11:46:34)

The Zabraki prepares the Sunrise expertly, sliding the glass across the bar top and taking Adalyn's credits.
"About usual," she replies, "I've seen worse crowds."
A serving droid approaches the bar and relays various orders which the girl turns away to fill.
Meanwhile Layni slips in and finds a place to sit not far from the door. Almost immediately a man approaches her, all smiles and swagger.

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-05-01 12:28:35)

Acknowledging Layni's appearance only with a glance her way, Adalyn notices the drunk man approaching her. The young woman had little doubt Layni could handle the man, and if she was smart would use the man's attention to get information. Resolving to just keep an eye out, she turns back to the Zabraki barkeep. "**I'm looking for someone. Was told he was spotted here earlier.**" She pulls out credits double the amount of the drink she had ordered and taps it on the counter lightly. Once she has the girl's attention she continues, "**A Verpine?**"

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-05-01 12:42:06)

"Yeah, a lot of people been looking for a Verpine," she replies, eyes flicking toward Adalyn as she continues to shake some spirits together.
"You don't look like much of a bounty hunter to be honest lady. I'd steer clear if I were you, you're competing with a couple of naaaasty-ass people."

Adlayn half shrugs as if she didn't really care what the bartender thinks of her appearance and takes a sip of the mixed drink. "**I heard someone put a bounty out on him, guessing he hasn't been found yet?**"

"Well now," the Zabraki replies, "I wouldn't know about that. No one gets taken in this bar; we made sure it got a five minute headstart. A lot of people followed though..."
She finishes the drinks and hands them over on a tray to the serving droid, which bumbles away. Then she looks back at Adalyn with hard eyes.
"Some of them came back. Some didn't. I don't know if anyone caught it."

The girl looks down at her tip then mutely slides it across the bartop and palms it.

Adalyn notes that would be about the same time she was herself taken at the arena.

With this new information in hand a part of her was hopefull. If Kilkrin had been given a head start it was possible he had gotten away. The fact some returned and others didn't could indicate he had either been caught or had managed to elude them and they had given up the chase. Glancing out among the patrons she checks in on Layni while looking for her next target. Someone inebriated but had the look of someone who might have gone on the chase. Sipping her drink she decides on her next step.

Surprisingly Layni is still talking to the swaggering drunk, who is now settled into a chair opposite her.
When looking for potential bounty hunters Adalyn is truly spoiled for choice; most of the bar's clientele are rough sorts and plenty of them carry weapons. Many do so openly, though it's a safe bet that the cloaked characters (of which there are many) are carrying concealed weaponry. In fact, even Layni's admirer is a potential person of interest. Now he is sitting, he has draped his cloak over his chair and he is revealed to wear a bandolier and two pistols.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-05-03 11:32:16)

Glad to see Layni seems to be handling her admirer, Adalyn turns her attention to the other patrons hiding her interest with sips of her drink. As any one of them could be a potential lead she decides to choose someone at random. With an inebriated target in sight she heads toward the table stopping next to a chair facing her target. She swirls her drink in hand as she gives the man a small smile. "**Mind if I join you?**" she asks, though she doesn't give the man much option as she takes the seat.

"Not in particular," he slurs in response as his drunken eyes focus on Adalyn. Those same eyes crease at the corners as the man gives a crooked smile.
"Here on your own?" the fellow enquires, glancing around to check he hasn't just let her hijack the table for a group of friends.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-05-03 13:21:47)

Adalyn returns the smile and gives the man a salute with her near empty glass. "**I'm a one girl party.**" With a final sip she sets the glass down and leans on the table toward the man. "**Though the party certainly isn't closed.**"

As the droid departs, Bau returns his gaze to Adalyn and asks: "what brings you to my table, Rayn?"

Glad the man has accepted her at his table, Adalyn continues to lean in toward him folding her arms in front of her on the table. Her hands idle now that she doesn't have a drink to hold. "**Boredom, curiosity,**" she lies. "**Aside from that man over there, you seemed the least grumpy of this lot.**" Nudging her head towards Layni's table she indicates the man who had joined her.

"Caz? He's a grumpy frakker most of the time, but he's well in his cups and he won a sabbac pot last night. Reasons enough to make an ass of himself."
Bau stares over at the flirtatious attempts of his peer for a moment longer then turns away with a grunt.
"Don't see why the idiot''s so happy, he was too drunk to even chase that bountyhead earlier."

"**A bounty came through here?**" Adalyn asks with genuine curiosity. Finally she'd found her opening. "**You must tell. I love a good story. Did you give chase?**" Leaning forward, she props her head up on her left fist giving the man her apt attention.

"You know girl," Bau says suddenly in lieu of replying "you have a familiar face. Maybe I've seen you somewhere before?"
He straightens in his chair, focusing on her and obviously trying to place it. At the same moment, the drinks arrive and he is distracted by his beer for the time being.
((OOC: A very low Deception roll for Adalyn there... He hasn't figured you out just yet, but it was close. I will be rolling periodically and he'll have a slightly easier time of it next time. Best get your questions in quick or try somewhere else before you're rumbled.))

A pit begins to form in Adalyn's stomach as Bau tries to place where he's seen her. She tries to make her smile unforced and appear as if the man had made some great joke. "**Believe me, if you had met me before we'd be skipping this little meet and greet,**" she says with a slight laugh, leaning back and taking a sip of her drink. *This isn't good. I could mind trick him, but there are witnesses.* While she feels the man would be a good source of information, she wasn’t sure if she wanted to risk getting caught in a bar full of hunters, head start or no. It would also mean her current cover was jeopardized and she’d have to start from scratch again. After all, she couldn’t find her friends if she was caught. *So close, but so far away as well.* If only she could just get the answers she wants out of him before he makes the connection or.. get him away from the tavern.
“**Do you want to get out of here?**” she asks raising a suggestive eyebrow.

Bau walks with Adalyn out of the Greasy Gear and away down the main thoroughfare, then cuts down an alley.
"It's quicker to get to mine this way," he tells her as they make the turn.
Mere seconds later she gasps in pain as her arm is twisted behind her and before she knows what is happening Bau has her pinned in a strong grip, her face mashed up against a wall.
"I don't normally get this lucky with girls," he comments darkly, "so I asked myself, why would you be so interested in me. And I realised I do know your face, girl."
Moments later Adalyn feels something cold slipping around her neck. Some kind of collar?

With a grunt of pain as her arm is twisted awkwardly behind her. Naturally, Adalyn brings up her free hand to try and stave off whatever it is he's putting around her neck. The last thing she wanted was a garrote getting a good grip on her. Refocusing her mind, she let's out a haggard breath and draws on her innate ability in the Force, picking up a good sized object from the alley and hurling it at her assailant.

Even with alcohol in system, Bau's bounty hunter instincts are finely honed. He simply steps aside - not relenting his pressure on Adalyn one bit - and the abandoned crate she had launched at his head smashes into kindling and splinters on the wall next to her. She is struck again with the notion that he wasn't nearly as drunk as his act had implied.
Moments later the thing around her neck closes with a click.
"Well now," Bau hisses, "a Jedi. Isn't *that* something. Even so I wouldn't try any more tricks if I were you. Not unless you like being shocked. Besides, if you behave you'll get to see your insect friend again. Wouldn't that be nice?"
((OOC: Adalyn's UtF roll doesn't exceed Bau's Reflex defense. Regrettably for her, his own "attack" was a lot more successful.))

### **Alicia** (2012-05-09 18:08:42)

A frustrated grunt escape her lips as he ducks the crate she had meant for his head. His retaliation left her dizzy for a moment, long enough for him to finish putting the collar around her neck. This fact only increases her frustration. She'd been caught and it was due to her own carelessness, not only that he now knew she was a much bigger prize being a Jedi and a much more dangerous one if he had sense.
Not ready to test his threat about being shocked she stops resisting, finding it better to bide her time. When it came to it, she would be putting to the test whether she'd be able to negate the energy from the collar with the Force.
His comment about Kilkrin brings her up short. "**He's alive then?**" she asks slowly. *Did Bau manage to capture him as well?* If do then he was her best lead in finding her friend. Even if it meant remaining his captive. Tentatively she draws on the Force, opening a link with Layni she hoped the woman would be open to. Sending her a myriad of images to lead the woman to where they were now she adds the simple command of *follow*.

"Oh yes," Bau responds conversationally, "bounty heads are generally worth more alive than dead."
"Although you may be worth something altogether more," he adds thoughtfully, backing away from her carefully and quick-drawing a pistol.
"Why are you interested in Thatrik anyway? What are the Jedi doing bothering with the likes of him?"

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-05-10 01:35:34)

A flutter of hope passes through her mind as Bau admits Kilkrin was still alive, though he made no mention of Alaris. Her fate would have to remain unknown for the time being. These thoughts are of course overridden by the searing pain in her shoulder from her released arm and as she steps away from the wall she rotates it gauging just how badly Bau had strained it when he had twisted her around. With the pain manageable, she turns slowly to face her captor taking to leaning against the alley wall as she rubs the part of her face that had been smashed to the wall. The longer she delays, the more time Layni would have to catch up.
"**What makes you think I'm a Jedi? Just because one can do 'tricks' doesn't make her one. The galaxy is a large place after all. I doubt a Jedi would have let herself be caught so easily,**" with the final comment she reaches up to indicate the collar, not touching it in the event it might set it off. The time to test it would come soon enough. With a shrug she answers his question. "**As for Thatrik.. I had a business proposition, which I guess I'll won't be delivering now. Shame. I think he would have liked it.**" Even though it was an assumption, who was to say Thatrik wouldn't have seen the bribe to reveal information concerning her rogue Jedi as a good deal.

Bau smirks at Adalyn, amused by her stories. The bounty hunter points right along the alley with his free hand, indicating that she should continue walking in the direction they had been heading after leaving the bar.
"The Jedi were purged easily enough, I hear," he retorts while falling in behind her, "and those that survived have substantial bounties on their heads. To be quite honest I can't be bothered to deliver you to Imperial authorities off the station, but I bet Thatrik will pay a damn sight more for you now. Isn't that funny? You had a business proposition. Now you *are* one."

Eventually Adalyn does move from her place leaned against the wall, and then proceeds slowly back the way they had come to the main drag. For a moment she casts her eyes down the alley, contemplating making a run and taking her chances she could absorb enough of the collar's energy to get away, not to mention any shots Bau sent her way. It is more than likely he has a good shot.
Then there is Kilkrin. While being a captive herself isn't very encouraging, it would get her close enough and once she found her Verpine friend there was always the possibility of escape from there. She would just have to trust in the Force and be smarter. Trust Thatrik would rather keep her alive long enough to manage an escape.
Taking a slow steps she makes her way out of the alley, not the least amused by Bau's words having lived through the purge and knowing the truth of the circumstances in which it occurred. Bau could hardly understand how it felt to sense and even feel hundreds of one's brethren being wiped out in one foul swoop. She walks mutely, letting his words wash over her, though she has an amused thought she may have a better chance of escaping from Imperial custody than Thatrik. assuming of course the Imperial doesn't kill her on the spot.
When he asks her what her name is, she contemplates lying again at least then if she manages to escape he can't track her through it. "**Mara. Mara Pelagius,**" she makes up quickly.

"You sound genuine," Bau admits, "so either you're a good liar or a fool. I doubt it's the latter, eh? You being a Jedi."
Although she can't see him, Adalyn can practically feel his ugly, evil smile. It could be her imagination, but either way it makes her skin crawl.
The bounty hunter doesn't actually take her too far, ordering her to stop at the small worker's entrance to a warehouse no great distance from the port.
He leans forward to rap on the door, and shortly after a slot at roughly eye level slides open with the shadow of someone beyond.
"You again. And you brought a friend. Cute."
"She's the bounty you krellhead. Let me in."
The slot slides shut and the door swings open, revealing a passage beyond lit harshly by strip lamps. Inside is a yellow-scaled Annoo Dat wearing body armour. He gazes at Adalyn with four unfriendly eyes then turns to walk down the corridor. Bau prompts her to follow.
She is led into the warehouse proper, which is crowded with large industrial crates. In amongst these are several cages. Currently none are occupied, though that may soon chance as the Annoo Dat is leading her and Bau right to one of them.
Adalyn's Force senses tell her there are three other people in the near vicinity, though at present she cannot see them.

"**Believe what you will,**" Adalyn remarks. The man isn't stupid, but neither has he caught her in the lie. For now her true identity is safe, though unfortunately her face isn't. If she is indeed meeting with Thatrik it is possible she could make some sort of deal with him still. It is a slim hope, but right now that is all she has.
Keeping her pace steady, she updates Layni with where she is. Hoping at the very least the Miraluka is following. Ordered to stop, she glances around and gets a good look of her surroundings. With his prompting to enter the warehouse the young Jedi shoots Bau a glare before acquiescing.
As she walks she tries to focus on the others she can't see at the moment, trying to identify them. As they lead her to a cage, she resists a laugh. Metal bars weren't going to be much of an obstacle when she does choose to escape not unless they decided to make them with phrik alloy, which she doubts due to the metal's expense. It was just a question of how many lightsaber wielding captives they managed to get their hands on. When she reaches the cage, she doesn't get in it immediately. It wasn't good form after all to willingly go into a cage and while she has been cooperative so far she thought it was time to show a little dissent.

The three other sentients are lurking a short distance away behind the cover of the stacked crates. They surround her, with one of them crouching atop a crate between the cages and the door. They are calm, and presumably allies of the Anoo Dat. It's a safe bet they're armed and willing to fire on her.
Without any kind of warning the collar around her neck suddenly pulses into life, sending energy crackling through her nervous system. The collar produces an incredibly powerful current, designed as it is to keep the toughest of criminals of any species in check. Even with her ability to negate energy, Adalyn finds herself overwhelmed by the pain that wracks her body. It drives her to her knees as seemingly every muscle in her body twitches.
The Anoo Dat watches her dispassionately, then steps forward to start stripping Adalyn of her possessions. He, Bau, and presumably the three thugs lurking in the shadows all have her covered with blasters.
"Where's the other one anyway?" Bau asks, conversing as though the situation is completely normal. Of course, for him it is.
"Badly injured," the Anoo Dat responds, "it needed medical attention. No good dead."
If she wants to escape, she'll have to act fast. The alternative is to continue playing along, though that would mean surrendering her possessions.
((OOC: Negate Energy attempt - UtF result of 16 is bested by a damage roll of 23. Since it's stun damage, Adalyn takes a -2 Condition penalty as the roll beat her DT but her hit points are only reduced by 11 (half the damage roll).))

### **Alicia** (2012-05-12 14:09:47)

Unbidden a scream of pain escapes her lips, partly out of surprise of the shock and mostly due to the pain. At least now she knew the hunter's threat was hardly idle and next time she would know what to expect. Unfortunately, if she wasn't able to absorb the next one she'd likely be at the hunters' mercy; if they have any. Glancing up she sees the Anoo Dat approaching her intent on taking advantage of her weakened state to relieve her of her weapons. Hearing that Kilkrin wasn't here she quickly came to a decision. So far she'd made it easy for Bau to bring her here, but that was only because of her hope Kilkrin was here as well. Since that wasn't the case she was done playing nice.
With only a moment to react she springs forward, using her acrobatic skill to pass hopefully unmolested by the Anoo Dat at the same instant she sends what strength she can spare toward Bau using the Force to disorient the hunter long enough to prevent him from using the collar against her in this crucial moment. Passing the Anno Dat she uses her momentum to send her into a run past the cages and away from the hunters'. The fact she was heading away from the door didn't escape her notice.

The Anoo dat is surprised by Adalyn's sudden leap into action, and his sluggish attempt to grab at her completely fails to connect as she leaps over his head, twisting in the air to avoid his clawed hands. Bau is just as surprised when she calls upon the Force to overwhelm his senses. The bounty hunter cries out in confusion, falling to his knees much as Adalyn had done mere moments before.
As expected, three blasters are fired almost in unison, their reports echoing loudly in the large warehouse. She is able to obfuscate one of her attackers successfully, and the Anoo dat grunts in surprise as the stun bolt intended for her strikes him instead. He falls to the floor, unconscious. One of the other attacks misses, but the third hits her in the back.
((OOC: Bau is knocked 3 steps down the CT. The Anoo dat is KO'ed. Adalyn takes 5 hp of damage from the stun bolt.))

Adalyn can't help but to smile as her last minute plan goes off better than expected. Surprise had been key to pulling it off and surprise them she did. Dodging all but a final stun blast she shrugs it off. 
Having pulled off her stunt and knowing at least one of her captors was out of commission and Bau having taken the worse for her attack, she reverses her momentum. Charging toward the door, she focuses on the man covering her exit and lifts him. Aiming for Bau she sends the man toward him hoping to take the two obstacles out in one swoop. 
Drawing more on the Force she increases her speed, making a bee line for the door.

The Rodian by the door yells as he is lifted off his perch atop a crate and flung hard across the room. He smacks into Bau, the collision of their bodies a sickening crunch, and they fall in a pile with Rodian on top. As she passes she sees the alien's neck is broken, though she doesn't know whether Bau is alive or dead.
The remaining two thugs fire on her, but she moves too fast and the bolts go wide.
She reaches the exit and rushes along the passage beyond, arriving at the warehouse's entrance and throwing it wide in time to see Layni engaging a pair of Gran. They throw clumsy punches at her which she deftly avoids, flowing around them as she effortlessly slides from one echani form to another. She slams her fingers into the throat of one and he collapses, gurgling horribly. The other lashes out and she grabs his arm, turning his own momentum against him in an over-shoulder throw. He tries to get to his feet, but a kick to his head downs him.

Impressed Adalyn just stands in the door a moment, letting her body recuperate from being shocked while Layni finished dispatching the Gran. After all, the Miraluka appears to have everything well in hand. "**Nice move. I was wondering if you were coming.**" Opening her senses she reaches around to check her surroundings in the event reinforcements were on their way or there were more goons she hadn't yet detected.
Bolstered by the presence of her backup, she motions for Layni to step in. "**Unless you learned what clinic Kilkrin was taken to, I have unfinished business here. Not to mention, they've learned a bit too much about me. There's two in here which need to be dealt with, hopefully we can question at least one. If not the warehouse's keeper is still alive.**" She isn't intending on staying long, but she could hardly pass up the chance to get information from some very good sources.

"You just can't stop getting yourself into trouble, can you?" Layni asks. Given the evidence it's pretty much a rhetorical question.
The Miraluka stoops to search through the two Gran's clothing, looking for any kind of useful clue and giving Adalyn the time she needs to recuperate. She takes both of their comlinks and, seemingly as an afterthought, also pockets their credit chips.
Meanwhile Adalyn has been expanding her senses as far as they can stretch. She realises with a jolt that those still alive in the warehouse are moving. Not toward the entrance, toward her. Instead two are heading to the far side of the building, possibly to another exit? A third is heading upward toward the roof.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-05-14 09:52:02)

The rhetorical question causes Adalyn to laugh and in the process painfully pull an already sore muscle. "**Ebb and flow, my friend. You know how the Force works.**" she adds with a slight shrug. Leaving the Miraluka to loot the bodies of the Gran, Adalyn takes in her surroundings. "**They're on the move. Two to the back and the third to the roof.**" Knowing there were two goons still alive and the Anoo Dat was unconscious when she had left the warehouse she mentally tallies them as the ones moving. "**I'll take the one on the roof,**" she decides and looks for a way from the outside to cut the guy off. Failing that she makes a run for it the way she came, back into the warehouse using her Force influenced speed.

Adalyn cannot see any easy way onto the roof from this side of the building; if there are emergency stairs then they're on one of the other sides. She pauses for a moment to search her feelings, then decides that going left around the building is probably a good idea.
"Oh hell," Layni mumbles as Adalyn bursts into another Force-imbued sprint. Without further ado she runs in the opposite direction.
Adalyn discovers a flight of fire stairs half-way along the building after she turns the first corner. However, the distance between the lowest flight and the ground is about six metres, the ladder that would descend in case of fire being currently raised. Not an insurmountable problem, but an irritation regardless.

Spotting the emergency stairs, the young Jedi springs forward with grim determination. Using the Force to empower her she takes a running jump, reaching for the suspended ladder above her. No thoughts of failure cross her mind as she leaps into the air, giving herself over completely to the power of the Force.

The distance to the ladder is difficult even for a Jedi, and Adalyn realises she isn't going to make it. She connects with the warehouse wall and launches herself off from the surface, the second jump giving her the additional height she needs to grab hold of the bottom of the raised ladder. Under her weight it suddenly gives, and she finds herself borne back to the floor as it rattles downward.
She loses valuable seconds climbing the distance back up to the stairs, then sets off up the zig-zagging flights with loudly clanging footsteps.
As she reaches the top she hears a distant cry of alarm from the other end of the warehouse. A male voice - one of the thugs may have just encountered Layni.
She sees the third figure some distance away, running the distance between an open door and the roof's edge, his cloak billowing out behind him. It is Bau. He turns in time to see her rising onto the roof and shoots her one of his leering grins.
Then he does something pretty mad: he jumps from the roof.
Two things happen at once.
One: as Bau falls he turns in the air, a pistol in hand. With a hiss, a length of syntherope attached to a grappling hook flies from the gun and the hook punches through the door of the stairwell behind him. Bau drops out of sight.
Two: the collar around Adalyn's neck crackles into life again, overwhelming her ability to cope once again. Having experienced it before does nothing to diminish the agony the second time around.

Forced to her knees once more by the searing pain of the collar she doesn't give Bau the satisfaction of hearing a scream of pain this time. Knowing it would be useless to follow the hunter now she remains where she is for a moment recovering from the sudden stress the collar has exerted on her body. She hated that the hunter was out there in full knowledge of her capabilities and now likely has a personal vendetta to capture her or even kill her.
Quickly recovering she makes her way to the door into the warehouse. If Bau escaped it meant the Anoo Dat was likely still unconscious in the building and right now he was her best chance in finding her Verpine friend.

"You want the other one?" she asks.

Adalyn can't help but to give the other woman a tired, devious smile. "Put them in the cages see how they like it."
Moving to check on the Anoo Dat she removes his weapons taking all his possessions from his person. Most importantly she looks for some way to remove the collar from around her throat. Finished with her task she too drags him to a cage and deposits him within, though she doesn't close the door ready to administer him to wake more quickly. Wasn't like they had all day.

"You got it," Layni replies and sets to work.
Adalyn finds that the Anoo dat is carrying a heavy pistol and a set of three vibrodaggers. Unfortunately nothing that she thinks might help with the collar though.
Soon the lizard-like alien is the only one left outside the cages: the iktotchi and a human are locked up together. Layni starts snooping around to see if she can find anything while Adalyn tries to revive the Anoo dat.
Eventually he comes to, and when he realises his situation he hisses and spits.
"Bitch, I will tear your face off!"

"I'd advise against doing anything rash. Unlike your goons I have a good shot," she remarks reminding her prisoner it was one of his own who shot him. Once he's taken her threat to heart she asks, "Where is the Verpine?"

There was the option to compel him with the Force and at this point it was likely they would all remember what she had done. To remove them as a threat she would have to kill them and she isn't sure if she is capable of doing it.
Coming to a decision she lowers her blasted ever so slightly. "You will answer my questions," she says using the Force to compel him.

Adalyn's commlink suddenly buzzes. It is Layni, upstairs in the office.

Realizing the Anoo Dat was overcoming her compulsion, she backs out the rest of the way and closes the cage behind her making sure it locked. "**Well… it's been fun. Thanks ever so much for your help.**" With a grin she turns away from the cage, watching the entrance to the warehouse grimly.
Into her comlink she responds to Layni's message. "***Let's get out of here. I'll meet you on the way to the roof,***" she says, figuring the office would be nearly on the way to the roof access where Bau had conveniently left an unknown method to escape by; particularly if the guy in black armor has been here before.
Giving their caged captives no more than a final glance she makes for the stairs which would take her to the roof.

Adalyn hurries out into the hall and along it to a stairwell which takes her up past the office to the roof. Layni is already up there at the top of the stairs. Extending her senses, Adalyn realises that the black-armoured stranger is now downstairs in the hall.
Layni doesn't require any explanation of the escape plan, her Force sight having already shown her the trailing rope caught on the roof's edge. She crosses the distance and slides herself over the edge, starting the descent.
The man below starts up the stairs. Does he know they're there?

Adalyn looks around for something she can use to temporarily barricade the door. Hopefully the armored man was just heading to the office, but there was no reason to not be careful. Last thing she wanted was to encounter another bounty hunter so soon after having escaped. With a mental eye on the unknown making his way up, she finishes her plan and moves to the edge. Urging Layni to speed up, she waits till the other woman is a safe distance down before starting her own descent.

Layni drops the remaining distance and rushes away from the warehouse, headed to the cover of an alley.
Adalyn is soon following her. Looking back, she can see a man in a full suit of polished black body armour leaning on the wall at the edge of the warehouse roof watching her go. His right hand makes a fist and he slams it down on the wall in frustration, then turns to go back to the stairs.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-05-16 19:36:16)

Adalyn can't help but get an ominous feeling as she sees the armored figure as she slips into the alley. It seems there were now two hunters who had come close turning in the bounty. Now it was just a matter of getting to Kilkrin before the hunters made their way there first. Catching up to Layni, she can't help but give the other woman a grin. "**Well.. that was fun. I found out where they sent Kilkrin though. Fourteenth bordering the Nest, some doctor called OPae is taking care of him.**" Casting a glance behind she can't help but to make sure they aren't being followed before turning her attention back to Layni.

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-05-17 14:28:36)

"OPae?" Layni asks sharply.
"I've heard of him. He's - well, he's not really a doctor. Not in the sense that you walk out of his clinic feeling happier and healthier, anyway. We'd better move fast."
On the other side of the alley, Layni finds a parked speeder. She pauses, extending her Force senses to make sure no one's watching. Once satisfied she hotwires the vehicle with practised ease and they are soon speeding along to OPae's clinic.
The "clinic" turns out to be in the basement of a grimy building. If it weren't for the battered sign out front Adalyn would never have guessed that the unassuming stairs leading down to a grey door were the entry to anything other than somebody's home. In fact, the place reminds her of Layni's foretune telling establishment, and she realises that they aren't actually that far from it. The warren of twisting little roads in which she had lost her pursuit after the arena *is* the Nest.
"How do you want to play it?" Layni asks. "If it's like my place there's no rear entrance."

"**Then we'll have to go in through the front,**" Adalyn remarks looking over the building. She reaches out with her senses to determine if there were going to be more than the expected 4 or 5 sentients within. "**I can draw an illusion, enough to get any guards to open the door. It might even be enough to get Kilkrin out if we play the cards right. I'm more wondering where we're going after this. If Kilkrin is injured we have to be prepared for him not being able to move on his own. And I'd rather not go back to your place just yet,**" she says fingering the collar. The young Jedi wasn't going to put it past Bau to have a tracking device or something installed in the blasted thing. Glancing over at Layni, she waits to see if the Miraluka has an ideas having been here longer than Adalyn has.

"I'd say we should get that collar off you, but I don't fancy finding out what happens when you tamper with it."

Following Layni as she gets out of the speeder, Adalyn nods in agreement. "The collar will just have to wait them." Looking at the basement apartment her face takes on an expression of focus,
"Let's get this over with. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to cast an illusion making us appear to be two of the guys we took out at the warehouse. With luck no one has reported the incident there yet and they'll let us in. We'll have to work fast though as it will only last for about 5 minutes, and if they touch us the act will be up too. It should at least be enough for us to get in the door."
With Layni's approval, Adalyn closes her eyes concentrating on the deception and taking her time to make sure it would be adequate.

Adalyn's perceptions confirm her suspicions - there are four live beings within the building, though the life signs of one are very faint.
She calls upon the Force to shroud herself and Layni in a convincing illusion of the two Gran she witnessed her companion defeat not so long ago. Strictly speaking it is not an illusion, but rather a projection that will pervade the minds of anyone looking at the pair, convincing them that of something that simply isn't true. It fools the mind but not necessarily the senses, they must be careful not to let anyone interact with them too intimately.
"Shall we then?" Layni enquires, stepping toward the steps.

With a nod of her head, Adalyn makes her way too towards the basement 'clinic'. After pausing only a moment to make sure Layni was ready, she knocks on the door. A lie ready to be given to whoever answers. If the door isn't answered quickly then Adalyn checks to see if the door is locked.

Closer to, she realises there is a pinhole camera in the door allowing those inside to see who is without. She's pretty sure her illusion will fool them regardless of distance or means of sight though.

"I'm mid-surgery here," the Doc's voice wheezes, "you think I can just pause it and relocate the patient? Hired goons, what the hell are you like."
The door slides open.
"If there's a situation then you'll just have to help secure my surgery won't you? Get in then, quick now."

The doctor Adlayn quickly realizes was going to make things difficult for them, but as he had opened the door for them the young woman was hardly going to let the opportunity pass by. Giving Layni a sideways glance she steps into through the sliding door into the 'clinic'. Looking around quickly, she moves further in to give Layni room to enter as well.
The Doc was obviously not going to turn over his patient till he was done, which meant they were probably going to have to take more drastic measures. It also meant they would have to deal with the other guards as well, a fact which didn't worry the young Jedi remembering how ineffectual the other guards had been against just one of them.
"**Doc, how long before you're work is done,**" she asks moving deeper into the apartment and ignoring the other guards for the moment.

Inside, the dingy rectangular room has been emptied of everything apart from the trappings of a surgery space: metal tables, cabinets, tools and trays. Not far from the door, two more mercenaries lurk about; one Rodian leaning against the wall, arms crossed, while his Gand companion sits on case that judging by its markings once contained medical supplies. There are also three humanoid droids in the room - two bearing blaster rifles, the third an old model medical droid assisting the doctor with his work.
Doc OPae, a Woostoid dressed in scrubs, glances up from his work.
"It takes as long as it takes," he chastises, "another hour or so."
On the table in front of him lies Kikrin's body. The insectoid's body seems to be at least partly cybernetic now. The medical droid is currently sealing an incision in Kikrin's chest, while the Doc picks up a laser scalpel and leans in, aiming the device at the top of his patient's head.
"Now be quiet, this is *very* delicate work."

"You have your orders," the Woostoid replies mildly, glancing up, "and I have mine. You can tell your boss that I don't answer to him. I answer to no one but Cypher. He's asked for the full works so that's what's going to be done. And as you can see I'm not done. I'm finishing what I'm being paid for, not that I have in fact been paid. No no no, I think my patient will just stay right here with me for now. Unless you have a way to make the surgery go faster, or to make the credits clear into my account, I suggest you shut up and let me focus before I accidentally kill this creature."
Behind Adalyn and Layni, the Rodian straightens and moves away from the wall, speaking to them in Rodese. He seems calm, though his hand gestures are both expansive and expressive. It would help if either woman had a clue what he's saying.
The interruption dismissed, Doc OPae ignites his laser scalpel and leans in to get to work.

Restraining herself from grinding her teeth in frustration, Adalyn instead uses the mental energy to focus on the Woostoid doctor. Nudging him with the Force she hopes to stun him enough to make himself believe he's feeling a bit ill or less capable of fulfilling the contract right that moment. With the Rodian coming up behind them, she's forced to ignore him but a part of her prepares for what might be an inevitable conflict. If it comes down to it, she prepares herself to lift the doc with the Force and fling the Woostoid at the Rodian.

OPae suddenly moans and swoons, his grip on the laser scalpel loosening as he staggers and clutches for the operating table instead. The whole thing happens as though in slow motion, the surgical instrument dropping agonisingly but inexorably towards the Verpine on the table.
In the meantime, the Rodian has grown more agitated as his words are being ignored by the Gran he believes to be his comrade. His Gand colleague has also stood up, sensing something untoward is going on. The Rodian reaches out to grab Adalyn's shoulder as he yammers at her, an action that will break the illusion. Sensing that the time for subtlety is over Layni punches him so hard his jaw clicks and he sprawls on the floor with a yelp of agony.
The Gand goes for his weapon. The two security droids raise their own with a stereo whirr of servomotors. The medical droid scuttles for cover. OPae groans and looks around, bleary-eyed and confused. And pervading the room is the smell of sizzling chitin and flesh.

The glamour affecting Layni and Adalyn shimmers and fades now that contact has been made. Before anyone else can react Adalyn is already moving, rushing between the slow-reacting security droids and to the opposite end of the surgical table. Her fingers find the handle of the laser scalpel buried in Kikrin's skull and draw it free... too late. The heart rate monitor's regular bips grow ever more rapid and finally merge together in an endless, grating whine.
Despite the Woostoid species' reputation for non-violence OPae's face contorts in fury and he takes a clumsy swing at Adalyn, raging at her.
"What did you do!?" he screeches, "what. Did. You. DO!?"
"Jeedai!" the floored Rodian shouts in alarm, the Bocce alternative to "Jedi" recognisable enough even if the rest of his words had seemed pure gobbledygook. He rapidly draws his pistol from its holster at his hip and takes a pot shot at Layni. She moves too quickly, zipping sideways toward the Gand, the bolt shrieking past to scorch the door frame. The Miraluka runs up the wall near him then launches herself from the surface, one knee raised so that it smashes into his face and sends him sprawling to the ground next to his Rodian friend. Layni lands above him in a crouch, her sightless blindfolded face perfectly serene.
The two droids turn and take aim at the closest threat to their master, Adalyn. With her Forced enhanced senses she moves too quickly to be struck by either blaster bolt, but without her lightsaber she is unable to do anything but avoid them. Helpless, flat-lining Kikrin is, it could be said, not nearly so agile. One of the stray bolts hits his chest while the second silences the whining of the heart monitor permanently. The machine sparks and gives off smoke, possibly in danger of catching on fire.

Reacting to the shots being fired at her, she's unable to prevent the bolts aimed for her from hitting the helpless Verpine. She watches in horror as her already critical friend was given a final blow. It was unlikely he would have been able to survive the head trauma, but now even more so the direct hit to his chest. One thing was for sure, she couldn't stand there and do nothing while he died. Calling on the Force as she sends one of the droids to collide with the other, leaving Layni to finish them off. She was already on the move again, rounding on the Woostoid doctor and shoving him if she can toward Kikrin. "**Save him.**"

"First you kill him, then you say save him," OPae sputters even as his two security droids drop to the floor with a loud clamour, crushed together by the impact, "there is nothing left to save!"
Beside him, sparks fly from the damaged heart monitor and it suddenly billows flame, causing the doctor to stumble back in alarm.
The Rodian tries to fire at Layni again but she kicks his arm, knocking it away and causing the bolt to go straight up into the ceiling. The alien then pulls out a comlink, but before he can call for back-up the Miraluka silences him with a blow to the throat.
Somehow though, for some reason, back-up *has* arrived. The sound of several speeders coming to a halt outside the building can be heard.
"It's too late Adalyn, *time to go!*" Layni urgently insists.

Adalyn blinks for a moment in denial over the turn of events. She'd failed him. Kikrin was dead. She'd killed him. The last fact hits her hard, and it's only at Layni's urging that she snaps out of it. Stepping away from the burning heart monitor she kicks it over, letting the flames converge where Kikrin's body lay in the hopes of making it impossible for OPae to experiment further with his corpse. Not wanting to get caught in the flames she hurries past and moving with Layni heads out to face the next problem of what is arriving outside.
It would be an easy matter, she realizes, to make a run for it like she has before using the Force to augment her speed. However, she isn't about to leave Layni behind if she can't keep up.

Incandescent with rage, OPae screams bloody murder as Adalyn flees the scene, even going so far as to pick up an old-fashioned metal scalpel and fling it at the retreating Jedi. The impromptu weapon embeds itself quivering in the wall by the door, missing her by a scant half-metre.
Adalyn emerges up the steps to see two large speeders parked haphazardly across the road outside. Each of them is occupied by armed men, but they differ from the thugs. They wear identical helmets and armour, a uniform, suggesting they belong to a rather more official group. Station security, perhaps?
Both speeders have a manned heavy rifle swivel-mounted at the rear, and these weapons are pointed right at her. The other passengers start disembarking, while a sour-faced human stands up on the front seat of the first speeder, raising himself above all but the soldiers manning the rifles.
"Hands in the air," he shouts, just as Layni comes up the stairs behind Adalyn, "*both of you!*"
Suddenly both speeders launch upward into the air and flip, the men still aboard falling out of the raised vehicles onto the road below. The speeders drop then, crushing the screaming security patrol beneath them.
Beyond the wreckage is a tall man in an enclosing suit of sleek black armour plating. The one who was at the warehouse, Adalyn is sure.
"Don't run away this time," the stranger suggests as he walks toward the women, hands raised in a gesture of calm, "I'm here to help."
The voice seems familiar to Adalyn, and she suddenly realises that despite a change in outfit this is the very same man who engineered her escape from the arena.

Leaving the basement she had hardly expected the local security forces to have found her first. Though the young woman supposes she's been a thorn to Cypher enough to pull in more official help their timing was less than ideal. 
As the vehicles rise with Force Adalyn frowns at the armored man. Twice he had saved her from a difficult confrontation, and yet she didn't know why. Shifting away from the entrance to the basement she gives Layni room to move. "**Why?**" she asks simply, repeating the same question she had asked him in the alley way several hours before. "**You've taken a huge risk revealing yourself like this,**" she comments motioning to the carnage he's wrought.
Looking around she realizes lingering about wasn't going to benefit any of them. Destroying the security forces' property was likely going to bring more of them here soon.

"Jedi help people," he says, shrugging his plated shoulders. "Certainly they should help old classmates. Besides, you and I have a mutual acquaintance who want to get you safely off the station."
Layni passes them, leaping into the driver's seat of her hot-wired speeder. The mysterious armoured man hops into the passenger seat.

"Well no actually," he responds, "it was Khol who rescued Alaris."
Reaching up to unclasp his faceless helmet he removes it, revealing a shock of red hair. He turns to look at the girls with a pair of startlingly green eyes.
"And now you've had a moment to digest that, introductions. Name's Veva," he tells them, "though we've met before, Adalyn. Years ago, back at the temple. Before they declared you dead. Never knew you well, but still it was a surprise to see you at the arena. You'll have to fill me in on the how and why of that sometime."
"I'm Layni," the Miraluka shoots at him, "nice to meet you."

For a moment, the shock of hearing those words stops her raging thoughts and all she can hear is the sound of her heart beating. The look would probably be amusing if it wasn't for the tone of her voice. "**Kohl…**" she starts barely audible as her brain starts kicking in. "**Khol Torendau? He's here?**" It was almost hard to believe. After having looked for him for so long to just have him inadvertently be where she least expected him to be even though a part of her had hoped. She had been hoping for a long time only to be let down time and again. "**That… that bastard.**" The words seemed to shock herself even as she says them, but in all seem to encompass her current thought process. For two years she always wondered what her reunion with her friends would be like and soon she would have her answer. Though she didn't imagine the pain she went through that day on New Holtsice would resurface.
Her attention is drawn away as her masked savior removes his helmet. Welcoming the distraction from her thoughts she squints at him. A vague recollection of meeting a red-haired youth back before her mission with Master Ta comes to mind, but it was his eyes that confirms it. It felt like a lifetime ago, had it really only been a few years? "**The Altisian Order took me in, though I'm not sure why they didn't inform the Council of my recovery.**" For a long moment she dwells on the matter but then decides she didn't entirely care. At the time it had been unlikely she would have wanted to return and now… Well the Jedi Order was now essentially gone.****

"Maybe they thought that it was your choice to make," Veva says wisely, "or your responsibility. It's moot now, anyway. The Jedi Order is shattered. It's good to know there are more survivors though."

Adalyn nods in silent agreement with Veva's reasoning. With a smile she imparts a bit of good news. "**More than you would probably believe, actually. I've been helping to smuggle any survivors or blossoming Force users to safety the last couple years.**" The young Jedi let's it soak in a little bit before going on. "**I was sent here to find a Jedi who's been engaging in activity against the Imperials. We got reports he was using the shadowport as a staging ground. Layni?**" she asks the last part as the pieces begin to click together in her mind. Veva was the right height for Layni's description, had proven to be adapt at disguising himself, and had some association with the underworld here. But if it wasn't him, that meant the one she sought would be Khol or she never found her target.

As the speeder closes in on the port Veva returns his attention to the route, guiding Layni to docking bay C5 where he says his friend's ship is waiting. The Miraluka pulls the vehicle to a halt and as soon as it stops he vaults over the side and approaches the hangar door. The red-headed Jedi waves at the camera above the door, which slides open almost immediately.
Veva gestures for the girls to follow him then steps through the door, where he is almost immediately swept up into a bear hug by a large cream-furred Bothan in possibly the most tasteless outfit in the Galaxy. He wears a sleeveless longcoat of rich green with yellow trimmings unbuttoned over a red shirt (also sleeveless), blue fingerless gloves, plum coloured trousers and turquoise boots. There are no fewer than seven piercings in each ear of varying shapes, sizes and colouration.
“Veva my lad!” he roars, releasing the Jedi and taking a step back, “why is that whenever I see you you bring a girl along. Two this time, I see.”
“Purely coincidence Cap'n, and besides you're really not one to judge.”
The Bothan gives a great belly laugh and slaps Veva on the shoulder.
“Well well, you're right at that, lad.”
The bright fellow turns to the girls and sketches an elaborate bow in the old-fashioned Hapan style, then takes each of their hand's in turn to greet them with a kiss.
“Captain Asryk Benla at your service, dear ladies, it will be my pleasure to welcome you aboard my humble vessel.”
The humble vessel in question sits on the landing pad in the middle of the hangar, directly below the exit tunnel. It is a a heavily modified Kuat Systems *Wayfarer*-class transport with “Second Smile” painted gaudily across the side.
“What about the others?” asks Veva, “are they here?”
“The Besalisk arrived and brought an unexpected guest. Some Twi'lek, said he wouldn't let her take the rap.”
Veva nods.
“Fair enough, the *Smile* can carry one more and he's probably right, Cypher would have questions for her. The rest?”
“Nothing yet,” Benla says, then glances over at the monitor on the inside of the door. “I tell a lie, there are people coming. Lad?”
Veva heads to his friend's side to take a look at the incoming party.
“That's definitely them,” he confirms, “open the door.”

One look at the motley crew gathered in the docking bay, the loudly dressed Bothan in particular, causes Khol's frown to deepen to the point that it threatens to permanently crease his face. When Captain Benla makes a sudden gesture, a dizzying spin of color and tinkling of metallic piercings follows, drawing "oohs" and "aaaws" from the two youngest, and a stunned blink from Garth. Lyra and Ti'an almost unconsciously reach towards the Bothan, as if grasping at a shiny new toy, and Khol quickly steps between his family and the seemingly-random assemblage of humanoids.
**"Lyra, Ti'an hands in your pockets. …Is this it Veva? We hidin' in some kind of system-hoppin' carnival?"**
By all appearances, Khol ask's a serious question, and the appraising glance he gives the *Second Smile* and its crew is rudely blunt. Just as the Korunnai's scowl is settling in, his sour mood is interrupted by a shy question from a tiny little voice.
**"They's look real happy Khol! Is'at why the ship gots two smiles?"**
Sweet, innocent, quiet Lyra. Khol splutters for a response while shooting silencing glares at both Alaris as well as Garth, and then buys himself some time by loudly clearing his throat. He gives the docking bay, as well as the spaces beyond, one last sweeping perusal, both with his eyes and with the Force before he settles in to answer the adorable little Lepi.
**"I, uh… I hope they're real happy Lyra. We'll all be really happy once we're away from here!"**

'Something like that,' Veva acknowledges with a smirk.
'Captain Benla, this vision of grumpiness - whom I feel obliged to point out is not female or indeed feminine in any way shape or form - is Khol, and these are the last of the passengers. You ready to go? We should try and get clearance before anything else goes wrong.'
The technicolour Bothan nods agreement, turning toward his ship.
'I'll prepare the crew for launch,' he states, clumping across the hangar to the *Smile*.
Neither Alaris or Khol immediately recognises Adalyn, such is the quality of Layni's disguise.

It’s with amusement Adalyn looks on the Bothan captain of the *Second Smile* as he introduces himself formally; the gesture charming in its aberrance. As he bends over her hand, she can’t help but smile. “**Adalyn Pallax, I hope we haven’t completely ingratiated ourselves,**” she says but her words are lost as the captain turns his attention to the new arrivals appearing on the security camera for the door.
The image skewed by the perspective and lens she couldn’t get a clear read on the arrivals, but she could make out Khol’s tall frame, Alaris beside him, and three other shorter figures shadowing them. Younglings? When the doors open and the group steps in her guess is confirmed. The younger children upon seeing the eccentric Captian Benla are immediately mesmerized and she watches as Khol protectively steps between them. Idly she wonders if he is protecting the younglings or Benla himself. The gesture was exactly what she would have expected from. Unbidden, unresolved emotions flood to the surface - old, frustrated anger, and new grief - and for a moment she’s glad neither Alaris nor Khol have seemed to recognize her through the disguise Layni had devised.
Benla takes his leave to prep the ship for departure and as he moves past her, Adalyn moves forward toward Khol’s ragtag family and Alaris. Still unsure of herself with Khol she moves to greet Alaris first. Giving her Twi’lek friend a quick reassuring hug she looks her over for anything more serious than the busted lip. Relief is paired by her suppressed guilt and grief over her failed rescue of Kilkrin *I killed him* she can’t help but thinking in a split moment before she pushes the thoughts away.
“**Alaris.. l’m so glad you’re safe,**” she waits for the moment of recognition, before giving her friend a half hearted grin. “**Some disguise, huh? Layni is a master.**” Even as she speaks to Alaris her gaze is already going to Khol, searching for any signs of the angry and desperate Padawan on the verge of giving into the Dark Side she had left back on New Holstice. Her gaze falls to the youth and then the two younglings and it softens as her residual doubt and fear ebb away. He was the same. More careworn, battered from two years of unknown tortures, but underneath it all the same.

'Adalyn,' she says, relieved, returning the hold. After a few moments the Twi'lek steps back, looking between her disguised comrade and Khol. She knows the significance of the reunion.
'Who wants to see the inside of the ship with aunt Alaris?' she asks the children, putting on a big smile and leading Garth toward the ship with the two youngsters in tow. Along the way she takes Veva's arm, dragging him with the group.
The red-headed Jedi catches on a few moments later.
'There's loads of interesting stuff to see kids,' he informs them, 'coming Layni?'
'Er, yes, that sounds fascinating.' The Miraluka replies, falling in with the group as they walk away toward the *Second Smile*. 'Really interesting....'

*Adalyn…*
Khol watches in stunned silence as Alaris embraces the unknown woman, and then takes the others into the ship. He stares as recognition filters in slowly, and then once the revelation sinks in the Korunnai can only manage the first thing that comes to his mind.
**"…Blonde? Why are you blonde?! Did they make you blonde?"**
For whatever reason the ex-padawan is furious over Adalyn's change in hair color, and seems fully prepared to storm off and pummel the "they" that made the woman change.

Thankful of the opportunity Alaris has given them her gaze doesn’t leave Khol and Adalyn watches as Khol slowly begins to register the change in her appearance. At least the more long term change as it was going to take a rather long time to get her hair back to its original appearance. His reaction however causes her to laugh, and she shakes her head as she closes the distance between them.
“**You haven’t seen me in two years and complaints over my choice of hair color is the first thing you say to me?**” She manages a final shake of her head and grins up at him. “**I both hoped and dreaded it would be you I would find here…**”

Without warning, Khol sweeps Adalyn up into a crushing embrace while she's still speaking, all but squeezing the life out of her. The Korunnai doesn't seem overly aware that Adalyn's feet are swinging above the ground as he speaks to her.
**"I told Alaris you shouldn't of come here- come for me. You should've stayed where it was safe and forgot all about me. But even after all of that, and all I've done, I wanted to see you again…"**
A mixture of hurt, and smoldering anger echoes in the ex-padawan's voice. But heard above all else is unrestrained joy. Early on in his separation from Adalyn, Master Ruhk, and the Younglings, the only thing that kept him moving forward was the thought that he had helped them escape. Khol thrived off of the fantasy that they had managed to find a haven somewhere far, far away from the newly formed Empire. Yet in his darker moments, doubts and dark thoughts always crept in at the edges, and eroded away his confidence until sometimes he was left in a near-panic over what he had done, and what may have happened to to his family.
Finding Adalyn again was a balm to a wound he didn't know he had, and it was all he could do to maintain control of himself.

Adalyn lets out a pained gasp as Khol quite literally sweeps her off her feet and into a crushing hug. Her words are interrupted as the air is pushed out of her lungs. Instinctively the young woman draws her arms across his strong shoulders and behind his neck. Even though she’s finding herself lacking in air, her breath just a wheeze, something rises within her whether from his embrace, words or the emotional deluge. As his words draw off she replaces them with a meeting of their lips. It’s only when her head starts to swim that she pushes on his chest. “**Can’t breath,**” she wheezes.

### **Anazider** (2012-06-28 12:41:25)

**"What?! Oh! Sorry, I jus- "**
Khol is rather abruptly interrupted when Adalyn kisses him. The would-be giant stands awestruck for the span of a second before he just as quickly sweeps her up into the kiss. Some of the pent-up frustration the Korunnai had been holding onto for all these years ebbs away in that moment, yet when Adalyn pushes away from him he holds her at arms-length, his face flushed and bewildered.
**"Wait- huh? You shouldn' of done that- what if Master finds out?! I mean, I liked it- I *really* liked it, but there's so much- and what I did on New Holstice, I just…"**
Taking a deep breath, Khol exhales in an attempt to stop his rambling and still the rapid beating of his heart. Looking at Adalyn, he notices that he's still holding on to her, and suddenly he pulls his hands back. One hand scratches at his shaved scalp while the other fiddles with a bit of nonsense on his utility belt, as Khol rocks back and forth on his heels.
**"We, uh… We need to talk about this. Probly' somewhere a bunch of idiots ain't watchin' us on the ships external dockin' cam."**
Khol gives a meaningful frown at the transport ship, and the camera in question.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-06-28 16:39:24)

As Khol sets her down and begins to ramble, she keeps a hand on his chest half in an attempt to steady herself while her head continues spinning and as a reassurance Khol wasn’t about to run off again. The kiss had left her head reeling, more so than the lack of air, and his closeness did nothing to help her overcome the emotions brought to the surface.
When he pushes her away further releasing his hold on her, his words finally register and Adalyn looks between him and back toward the ship. Her hands drop to her side and not knowing what to do with them she puts them in the pocket of her borrowed jacket. “**We do need to talk,**” she agrees, finding her voice. “**About a great many things.**” At first she doesn't make a move to head towards the ship, but finally she takes a step toward it. "**I know one thing for sure. I'll be glad to get away from here.**"

### **simplyscribed** (2012-06-28 17:10:05)

When Khol looks up at the ship he sees that it isn't just the camera he should have worried about. Lyra and Ti'an are watching from the top of the open ramp, somehow returned there despite their "aunt" Alaris' plan to keep them occupied. That somehow no doubt has something to do with Veva, since he is there too and holding the childrens' hands. Lyra seems fascinated while Ti'an looks horrified.
'See,' Veva tells them, grinning like a Cheshirii Moon Cat, 'didn't I say there were lots of interesting things to see?'
Just then Alaris appears from behind him, a scowl on her face, and smacks the troublesome fellow round the head then drags him back into the ship with the kids in tow. Khol would be prepared to swear that before she turned away the Twi'lek shot a smirk of her own at him though.
'I'm not sorry!' Veva shouts, laughing, then yelps in pain as out of sight he is again made the victim of Alaris' tough policy on miscreants.

**"…Why you Reek-humping sonuva- "**
Khol's time spent in the underground fighting circuit has taught him a new appreciation for expletives. An appreciation that he mumbles towards Veva as he angrily storms up the boarding ramp, all but leaving Adalyn forgotten behind him. The look he shoots at the man's back promises retribution, and he moves quickly to rescue his children from Veva's clutches.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-07-01 09:32:24)

Khol is soon able to regain charge of his young wards as Veva lets go of their hands of his own volition. He is entirely distracted by the sight of a sleek starfighter nestled away amongst the piles of crates in the *Second Smile*'s storage.
'Benla you magnificent bas- er, Bothan!" the young man exclaims, rushing forward to inspect the black, silver-trimmed Delta-7 *Aethersprite*. "You still have my *Raven*!'
He scurries away from Alaris and the kids to check the fighter over, making various musing noises over its condition. Layni and Garth are not present, presumably having moved further into the ship past the storage pod.
The Twi'lek shoots an amused look at Khol and Adalyn as they approach.
'Men and their vehicles, right? Do you think he's ever this excited to see a woman?'

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Anazider** (2012-07-04 16:03:32)

When Ti'an, Lyra, and Garth are back in tow, Khol's anger rapidly abates. He gives Veva one last shake of his head, turning the same exasperated look on Alaris before he steers the children around a bulkhead in search of quarters away from the Bothan and his *colorful* crew. But just as he rounds the corner a sudden thought strikes him, and he hustles back into the cargo bay.
**"Veva! Have you heard anythin' from Jack? I ain't heard from him since… Our meetin' at the casino…"**
As that realization begins to set in, Khol starts to think back and realizes that the besalisk had been silent throughout their rescue operation.
**"He ain't say nothin' on the comms durin' the whole rescue op. Not like he don't know the scrambled channel; he's the one that gave it to us. Somethin's wrong- I gotta go back and look for him."**
Khol sets down his various belongings and filters through them until he finds the black armor. He then begins to quickly assemble the pieces, his eyes towards the bottom of the boarding ramp and the shadowport beyond.

### **simplyscribed** (2012-07-04 17:10:21)

After a few moments Veva seems to acknowledge his fellow Jedi's distress, leaning out of the *Raven*'s cockpit long enough to placate him.
"Chill matey, the Captain says he's already here," he informs the Korunnai, "probably already in Wrywin's clutches over in the rec room. Go say hello why don't you?"

---

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Anazider** (2012-07-11 09:35:21)

Khol lays a blank stare on Veva for an awkward moment before he turns and begins to sheepishly remove the pieces of armor as if nothing at all had happened. When the armored is stowed away and hitched over a shoulder, Khol sighs, and in that sigh the Korunnai releases the last bit of anxiety he had been holding in since Veva and Adalyn turned his world upside-down. They had finally escaped, and for the first time in a long time the ex-padawan is able to keep the promises that not only did he make to the children, but to himself.
Holding Lyra and Ti'an by the hands, Khol resumes his wandering around the ship until he happens upon the recreational area, although first he peeks around the corner to make sure the Besalisk and this "Wrywin" are "decent" before he enters.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-07-12 14:58:26)

Khol enters the rec room to discover it occupied by a rather motley crew, and in their midst his Besalisk friend. The scarred old rogue is sitting on a couch beside an emerald-skinned S’kytri woman with steel-grey eyes. She has a long braid of coal black hair which drapes across her ample bosom. Her brows, painted lips, and varnished nails are as black as her hair.
Across the room from them is a pretty, petite Togruta girl in dirty mechanic's overalls sits between two droids shaped to emulate the forms of Togruta women. The girl is grinning wide, showing her pointed teeth, amused at some anecdote of Jack's.
All five look up when Khol enters, with Jack rumbling a greeting. The S'kytri touches her lips with her fingers, eyes passing over him appraisingly, while the Togrutas glance at him before leaning in to hold a private whispered conversation. Several giggles follow, one of them from a droid.
"You made it, m'boy! Good to see you safe."

**"Didn't hear a word from ya the whole time Jack; started preparin' to go back out there when Veva told me you were back here. What happened to you?"**
Khol folds his arms across his chest and strikes an imposing figure as he stands in the threshold leading into the recreation room. His glower is slightly ruined only moments later as Lyra and Ti'an go streaking past him to barrel into the rotund besalisk. They give the S'kytri and the Togrutans wide, distrusting glances as the hug Jack tightly.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-07-16 09:39:05)

"Kids!" The besalisk roars, sweeping the children up in his arms for a crushing hug.
"Sorry m'boy, last thing I heard was Veva's instructions. Then there were, ah, technical difficulties."
"He means he dropped his comm unit in a beer," explains a green-skinned twi'lek girl who emerges from the cockpit. Khol recognises her as Alini, one of Jack's bar staff and his underworld accomplice. She grins, then looks around at the swelling group.
"Getting crowded in here," Alini observes.
The S'kytri shifts from her lounging position, sitting upright. She beckons Alini over and then pats the seat beside her with the same hand. Alini sits, then looks like she regrets it as Wrywin's wing curls around her.
"We have enough crash webbing to get everyone secured to a seat or bunk for a safe take-off. When we're in flight we can set up some spare bunks in storage," the winged co-pilot says. "It won't be ideal but we'll manage."
"Where's Veva?" pipes up the young Togruta girl, looking at Khol. Her droid "sisters" also perk up at the red-head's name. "Is he here?"

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Anazider** (2012-07-17 00:14:56)

Khol quirks an eyebrow at the Togruta "sisters", and shifts his weight to lean against a nearby bulkhead.
**"Goin' spacey over some piece of junk you got in cargo."** He jerks a thumb over his shoulder as he speaks.
**"…Commlink in the beer again, huh? Whassat, the third or fourth one I fixed for you? Do you wash your hands in bantha butter before you start drinkin'?"**

Their reunion over and forgotten by the Korounai Adalyn follows Khol onto the ship eager to be away from the shadowport. She stops to stand next to Alaris and as Khol reclaims his adopted children and takes them in search of Jack she pulls the Twi'lek ranger aside.
"We should talk," the young Jedi says evenly.

"What is it?" Alaris asks, "can it wait until I've seen Kikrin?"
The seriousness of the moment is momentarily punctured by the passing of a togruta girl and her two droids from the direction of the rec room, the trio rushing into the storage pod and shouting greetings to Veva.

Adalyn frowns and shakes her head as she leads the Twi'lek away from the cacophony made by Veva's companions. The time it takes to move somewhere more quiet puts a pit in her stomach. She has to take a steadying breath to prevent her own grief from coming to the surface. "**Kikrin… Kikrin's dead,**" she spits out, and then before her emotions can get the better of her she continues. "**Layni and I tracked down where he was being kept, but by the time we got there his body was being replaced by cybernetics. There was an accident when I tried to interfere and… he died.**" Sobbing by the time she finishes, her head hangs in grief and guilt over what had happened. Now that things had settled, everything she had been holding in since the mission had gone wrong floods to the surface. Her exhausting getting the better of her, she let's her body slide along the wall till she's crouched on the floor.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-07-28 16:02:45)

"What?" Alaris gasps when Adalyn reveals Kikrin's fate. By the end of the story she is weeping too. The Twi'lek sits beside her friend and puts her arms around Adalyn. As they cry quietly together the sounds of Veva and the Togrutas conversing happily carry across the cargo pod, the normalcy of it an intrusion in the moment of shared grief.
Shortly, the stomping of boots across the cargo pod floor heralds the arrival of Captain Benla. The Bothan sees the two grieving women and falters, opens his mouth to speak. Then, uncharacteristically for the boisterous character, he simply stays silent and walks on past, allowing them their privacy. He exchanges greetings with the group clustered around Veva's fighter as he passes on toward the recreational area.

Alini smirks at Khol's joke, shooting him a knowing look.
"I dunno about butter but his diet's bad enough I could imagine greasy fingers being at fault," she says.
The Besalisk harrumphs.
"All's well that ends well m'boy, don't sweat the small stuff."
Captain Benla marches in, looking somewhat subdued.
"We're ready to go Wrywin," he tells his co-pilot, "make sure everyone is secured to a seat or bunk with crash webbing. Take off in ten."

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Alicia** (2012-07-28 16:27:49)

Adalyn returns her friend's comforting embrace with one of her own grateful for her presence. Somehow it made the grief easier to bear. Maybe that was why many placed an emphasis on funerals. They're a way to congregate with others and share a common bond with others.
A part of her knew too that she was going to have to let the death of her friend go. It wasn't the Jedi way to hold onto the dead. But for the moment she allows herself to grieve, a pit of guilt for her hand in his death making it harder to accept.
Briefly the young woman notices Benla's entrance and subsequent departure and is glad that the Bothan captain had the sense to leave the two of them be. Slowly she starts to compose herself and finding a clean part on the sleeve of her jacket and wipes her eyes. The time for tears was now over.

Khol shares the look with Alini, and then shakes his head at Jack.
**"I'll take a look at it later. For now, I could use a little rest."**
As if on queue, Khol feels a twinge in his side as the sum total of his wounds make their presence felt. But as a survivor of numerous injuries, the Korunnai knows just how to mask the pain. He gathers his kids and his gear and goes to find a safe, and fairly secluded bunk before takeoff.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **simplyscribed** (2012-08-19 18:44:52)

As everyone is strapping down ready for take-off Benla is talking with the shadowport's Port Authority. Overhead the great hangar doors groan open as he successfully negotiates clearance.
A quiet and insistent beeping begins and old Jack digs out another commlink unit that he hasn't yet managed to destroy, accepting the incoming call. He opens his mouth to speak but apparently gets no chance, the person calling talking faster. Jack's expression turns grim.
“Thanks,” he says, “I owe you.”
“I have a few guys working the Port and they just gave me some bad news,” he announces after ending the call, “we have two minutes. Armed pursuit headed this way.”
Veva reacts fast, fingers already moving to unhook his crash webbing.
“Benla!” He roars loud enough for those in the cockpit to hear, “Take off. *Now*!”
“Khol, you and your girl there man the turrets,” the young Jedi advises, already throwing off his own crash webbing and leaping to his feet, “if they're that close behind us we're not getting out of this without a fight.”
The red-head then rushes from the rec room towards the storage pod on an errand of his own, and as he disappears round the corner the *Second Smile*'s sublight engines thrum into life and the vessel begins to ascend.

Silently cursing as she manipulates the straps to the makeshift webbing holding her against what was soon to be a rough take off, Adalyn wonders briefly why Veva would think her capable of using the turrets. There was, however, no time to second guess her fellow Jedi as she rises out of her seat and fights to keep her balance against the acceleration. Not being familiar with the ship, she looks to Khol - with eyes still red - to see if he knows where they are supposed to go. "**Looks like Cypher, or who ever it is after us, doesn't know when to give up.**" she comments in a low tone idly to Khol.

## Re: Act II: In the Grip of Darkness

### **Anazider** (2012-09-09 16:39:51)

Khol quickly unbuckles his crash webbing and, after checking on the children one more time, sprints after Veva. He meets Adalyn in the corridor leading to the cargo bay, but doesn't halt his stride.
**"I dunno what Benla has on this thing, but these old Wayfarer's use to come with a quad and double blaster. You take the double, I'll go up top with the big gun!"**
Giving Adalyn a gentle shove toward the starboard gunnery well, Khol then takes off for the cannon just above the cockpit. He spares a frown for Veva as the other ex-Jedi is likely making for the storage pod and his old starfighter. Once in the gunnery well, Khol straps in and warms up the cannons, the targeting display flickering to life.

As the *Second Smile* rises up into the air, the hangar door slides open and armed mercenaries pour in, wearing masks to protect them against the vacuum that exists in the hangar now that the great airlock doors are open. The first few rush for cover behind various containers, magnetic boots preventing them from being affected by the lack of gravity. A second group come in behind, including a pair lugging in an E-Web behind them.
Khol and Adalyn reach the gunnery wells, dropping into the seats. The hangar is filled with the shrieking sound and colourful wash of blaster fire as they strafe the linked weapons and the thugs return fire. The E-Web explodes, taking out the gunnery crew in the blast. One of the mercenaries tosses a grenade, but fortunately Benla has gotten the shields up in time and the incendiary bounces back, forcing the Aqualish to duck behind a storage container to avoid being incinerated by his own grenade.
Above, the large airlock doors begin to close again. The enemy have obviously reached control. Benla only just scrapes the *Smile* through.
The pursuit isn’t over. A squadron of uglies emerges from another hangar, falling into an attack pattern.
Meanwhile, Benla is having a heated argument with Veva over a private channel. The rest of the crew and passengers can hear his side of the conversation through the open channel maintained by Wrywin.
“There’s no way Veva – you can’t be serious – I won’t do it – Garrrrrr, FINE!”
The Bothan captain roars in frustration as the ship’s storage unit opens up, causing a few loose containers to spill out into space. Emerging fast behind them is Veva’s sleek Jedi starfighter, a black shape barely visible in the light generated by its own powerful engines. It lances toward the enemy snubfighters, and their formation breaks and scatters. Soon the Jedi is in a swirling dogfight with them, outnumbered but an extremely talented pilot and holding his own. The enemy have to contend with fire from Adalyn and Khol, who while untrained with starship weapons, have the Force on their side. They each score hits, but between them only account for one of the enemy before the *Second Smile* is out of range.
“Prepare for hyperspace!” the co-pilot Wrywin informs everyone, eliciting shocked responses. No one is louder than the Togruta girl, who shrieks: “*What about Veva*?”
“Blasted idiot is on his own now,” Benla responds angrily, “says the important thing is to get our passengers out safe. It's too late. Nothing more we can do.”
“Ready for hyperspace,” Wrywin repeats sombrely, sounding nothing at all like her usual vivacious self, “in 3… 2… 1…”

END OF ACT 2. 
I know this has been a long time coming, my apologies. Act 2 has ended, though you may want to do some roleplay posts to wrap up your character's own responses to the escape.
The characters will now make it back to the Jedi underground, and another short period of time will pass (about six months) before the next Act begins. With Kikrin dead, Adalyn's existing team falls apart during this time. Alaris is reassigned shortly after their return and leaves on another mission. It would do you well to discuss the relationships between your characters during this time, with a particular emphasis on Adalyn's reaction to the emotional rollercoaster of losing Kikrin and finding Khol; and Khol's attempts to adapt and find a place for himself in the new order of things.
Cliff is taking over again for Act 3, so my final duty as GM is to award you 2,000 experience each and some EXPLOITS:
Khol earns the exploit: "Cracked the Cypher" - you may have escaped the Shadowport, but Cypher has promised it's only temporary. You'll fight him when he comes, for the sake of the kids you freed, to ensure their happy future. You gain one free Destiny Point, but it can only be spent to help you beat either the minions of Cypher, or anyone proven to either be allied with him or working in his interests.
Adalyn earns the exploit: "Private Misery" - your mistake with Kikrin haunts you and the fear of making a similar error occasionally cripples you into inaction. Whenever you are faced with a critical situation where you should act but an error may only make things worse, if you roleplay the conflict in your mind to the GM's satisfaction they may award you a Force point. If you delay so long you cannot act in time, you earn a Force point but also a Dark Side Point.

### **Alicia** (2012-10-26 04:13:34)

It’s with a mixture of relief and sadness Adalyn watches from the turret as the ship jumps into hyperspace. *Yet another left behind.* The fact Veva was doing this for them, to give them the opportunity to escape, doesn’t elude her. His fate weighs on her. However, she takes heart in the knowledge if anyone could survive, Veva could. The Force would be with him and if there was one thing she still had faith in, it was that.
With Veva gone, her task to recruit him had inevitably failed. She hadn’t even been the opportunity to speak to him about the attacks which could have devastating consequences. At least she could reassure Master Altis and the rest of the council Veva had not fallen to the Dark Side and if he could be approached again -keeping hope he would survive this last encounter- he would make an invaluable asset to their cause.
*A cause Kikrin died in upholding. What is it we’re fighting for?* The doubt seeps in for a moment. Her purpose these last couple years are clouded by the grief and guilt brought on by Kikrin’s death. *No… Murder*. The word seemed apt. While she may not have intentionally sought her friend’s death, it was by her actions he had lost his life.
It was like the Battle of Kristofan all over again. On that fateful day, she had led her squad of troopers into a rout before they had been forced to retreat. While she didn’t know for sure if her decisions had been the deciding factor of their defeat, all she knew was the result. Her master along with their entire force had lost their lives. Had it not been for Master Ruhk pulling her from the brink and restoring her to life she would gladly given herself to the Force. He had given her a second chance at life. Something Kikrin would never have.
It’s a long moment before she climbs out of the turret, the time in the small yet relatively secluded space giving her some of the time she needs to pull her thoughts together and dry the inevitable tears she had naively believed she had stopped shedding. All she felt now was a numbness and an ache to sleep so for a while she didn’t have to feel anything. With heavy steps, she heads toward the refresher to clean her face of the last vestiges of her disguise and to hide the tears of self-pity.

**"I'll find you again, Crazed Zakkeg," Cypher promises, "so enjoy your freedom while it lasts."**
They had one. After years of pain and struggle, violence and self-imposed slavery, they had managed to break free and were on their way to safety. Before the Second Smile had left the hangar, Khol had felt a tinge of something he had not felt in some time: peace.
...And with a single utterance, Cypher had managed to snatch it all away from him again.
So he fought. The Korunnai was out of practice with the freighter's laser cannons, but where he lacked in skill he supplemented with the Force. The blasters rang out again and again, each pull of the trigger shouting defiance at the Cypher's assertion that he would find Khol again and take away his freedom. But as the Uglies explode and Veva makes his gambit to save them, Khol knows that deep down he had only won a reprieve; Cypher would find him again.
A bone-deep weariness settles into Khol as he unbuckles his harness and slides out of the gunnery well, lumbering towards the bunk he shares with the children. He knows what he has to do to keep them safe- keep everyone safe- but it drags at him and threatens to wear him down completely. All he can think to do is to go sit with the children and think, before it is time to do what must be done, and leave again.

Face now cleaned and the cosmetics removed, Adalyn gazes at her reflections for a long moment barely recognizing the figure staring back at her. The weariness she feels is evident and the sharp contrast of her hair change left her feeling as if she stares at a stranger. The blonde, she decides doesn't suit her and would clash tremendously when her red hair starts to grow back. When there is the opportunity she resolves to have Layni dye it again. Maybe black.
The thoughts cause her to smile as she realizes how vain this might seem. After everything that had happened, she is worrying about her will look months in the future. Perhaps it was better about worrying about the alternative - things she couldn't control.
With a shake of her head, Adalyn tosses the borrowed jacket over her prosthetic arm. The top revealing more that she was accustomed to including the carefully maintained prosthetic arm. She shrugs off the discomfort and sets her sights for another concern. Standing outside the door to the cabin Khol and his small family has claimed as their own, the young woman finds herself standing there for a long moment debating. Wait for him to seek her out in his own time, or do it now and get it over with? On this small ship, the latter was probably the best.
Knocking softly on the door, Adalyn closes her eyes in an effort to center her mind for the coming encounter.

Khol sits on a bunk with his back against a bulkhead, Lyra and Ti'an dozing in his lap. Garth tinkers on some bit of electronics nearby, as he tended to do after a particularly stressful event. When the knock sounds at the door, Garth moves to answer it but is then stopped by Khol who then disengages himself from the drowsy children before taking the pair of steps to the entrance. As he opens the door, the Korunnai positions his body so that whomever is on the exterior of the bunk has their view shielded from the children within.
**"Oh, uh… Hi Adalyn. Eh… erm… What's wrong? What's happened?"**
As much as he towers over Adalyn, Khol seems completely off balance in the face of the young woman. The Korunnai shifts from foot to foot in the doorway, seemingly torn between inviting Adalyn in or closing the door so as not to disturb the children.

Adalyn stares up at his imposing stature and while her own slight frame is dwarfed by it, she hardly feels daunted. His sheepish demeanor toward her certainly diminished the effect his stature might impose. The fact he blocked her view into the cabin itself didn't escape her notice.
"I was hoping we could have that talk," Adalyn starts. "And... I need your help with a problem." Turning her head to the side she allows him to see the silver glint of the shock collar. Once her point is across she gazes back up at him with an emerald gaze.
The young woman leaves it open as to where the Korunnai wants to proceed.
