((Opening Crawl))
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">STAR WARS: DAWN OF DEFIANCE
Episode I: THE TRAITORâ€™S GAMBIT
</span>
It is a dark time in the galaxy. The evil Galactic Empire has spread from the Deep Core to the Outer Rim, and everywhere the Empireâ€™s tyranny can be felt.
Fleeing from the oppression of the Emperorâ€™s minions, agents of Senator Bail Organa have run to a remote space station above Brentaal. Known to be a vocal opponent of the Emperor's policies, Organa may be the last hope of freedom in the galaxy.
In the hopes of stopping these dissidents before they can reach the Senator, the Empire has alerted its forces on Sel Zonn Station, where the struggle for liberty rages on, and the first sparks of rebellion have begun to burn...
**************************************************************************************************************
Sel Zonn station hangs in the nothingness over the bustling core world Brentaal. Since Brentaal is at the intersection of the Perlemian Trade Route and the Hydian Way, the station is a waypoint for many travelers who need to refuel, change ships or perhaps just rest from the stress of a long journey. In your short time aboard the station, you've found that Sel Zonn is really two stations. The main areas seen by most visitors are clean and perfectly maintained. However, a few steps off of the beaten path quickly reveal that the station is rotting from the inside out. A short walk away from the main venues leads to decrepit sections of the station, filled with broken lights, tarnished metal walls, missing deck plates, and all manner of "suspicious" aliens that have been driven out of the nicer sections by the Empire.
Right now you are in one of the "nice" sections, the Promenade. This is the main commercial area of the station, filled with the bustle of revelry and commerce. Spilling out of the gambling halls are the sounds of victory and the moans of defeat, while the music of local bands issues from the cantinas. Only a handful of citizens mill about in the main areas of the Promenade, a few gazing out the massive windows at the planet passing below. Others rest in large open seating areas decorated with various fountains and plants. Businesspeople hawk their wares to the passersby, and occasionaly a few Imperial Navy troopers are seen patrolling the main avenue of the Promenade on their usual patrol at a leisurely pace.
((The action is about to begin, so don't let your character wander too far, but this is a chance to look around a bit and establish what you're up too on Sel Zon--just passing through, been doing a menial job here for months, etc.--and a little about your character.))

Ariq looked around the promenade and sighed. He was young and he knew it, but he still wondered how the galaxy could have fallen so fast and so hard. He remembered being a young boy in the care of his master, Master Harvek, learning about the Shimurra and being instilled with a desire to find them and master their ways. His Rodian master was often criticized by other Jedi for abandoning the Jedi way, but his personal choice in studies had allowed Harvek and Ariq to escape the Order 66 massacres. Ariq had watched the galaxy during that time and knew that the galaxy had rotted without the Jedi to guide it. It saddened him to think that in the years that had passed since, he had met not one other Jedi. He began to worry that he might be the only one left. But, he kept looking, just in case.
Even now, Ariq wondered through the promenade, intent on finding his way in this galaxy, hoping the Force would guide him.

"Oh Come on, It wasn't my fault!" Edwani argued with the owner of the ship she had piloted up until recently. "Alright so I took on a little extra cargo on the side, But I didn't get caught with those Iridoinian Rifles, and I gave you a fair cut!"
But the older human wouldn't hear any of it, shoving the female Arkanian Offshoot out the doorway and tossing her duffle bag of possessions after her. Then there was the unsatisfying sound of the lock engaging.
"Great, Just Great." She muttered to herself, and began walking towards the Promenade. There was little for her here. Edwani needed to find a ship out of here.

Artreth pulls his hood even further down over his face, trying to hide his features better. He is walking at a fast, but not suspiciously so, pace in order to reach his destination as swiftly, but inconspicuously, as possible. He has just finished buying some new supplies, and is now returning to the hanger to get of this station before the Empire catches him. Such is the life of a fugitive.

Sajin stood a part from a small crowd, gazing out of the space stations large view ports at the buzzing red planet below. He gazed down on Brentaal IV through half-lidded eyes, allowing the quiet murmur of the day-to-day functions of Sel Zonn station flow over him. After several more moments, the Nagai reached down and scooped up the rucksack laying at his feet, tossing it over a shoulder and continuing about his business.
**"So long as there is commerce, Sel Zonn will never sleep."**
He mused to himself with a smirk as he continued down one of the by-ways. Sajin had only arrived at the orbital platform a scant few days ago, but had yet to find work for himself. For his spartan lifestyle, the meager earnings he had made in his previous travels were more than enough to live on, but still there was a nobility in the work in and of itself. A purpose.
And so he ambled aimlessly, taking in what sights Sel Zonn had to offer while keeping an open ear for any sign of honest employment.

Jason stepped onto the hallway heading towards the Promenade, looking around as he adjusted his back pack. Being on "vacation", as his grandfather, for the last year served him well, though not enough. While Sel Zon was another stop on his way to Rendili through the Hydian Way, Jason was less than looking forward to another corporate run.
*Well, this was interesting a year ago*, Jason reflected as he looked around. *Then again, being stuck with a lazy butt* sithpawn of a backstabbing wholre like David would have gotten me to agree to anything.*
Shaking his head, he looked left just to see a female alien arguing with an older human until the the human gotten tired of listening, threw the female her belongings and slammed the door in her face.
*Wonder what she did to cause that?* Thought Jason as he headed over to her as she started towards The Promenade. *Hope she's in the mood for some company before I head out.*

Anandi stood silently by one of the large windows, sipping a local drink. It was bitter and had a strong bite to it, but it was cheap and that was the important thing. She watched as an Imperial patrol passed her by, keeping her eyes on them until they were out of her sight. A young couple walked past her, arm-in-arm, and she nodded to them, offering them a smile. There was no need to look suspicious, after all. She took another sip of her drink and continued to watch the Promenade.

Juss looked down at the planet, marveled on how the nearby sun's light reflected off the clouds and seas of the heavenly body, to bath him in it's soft glow. The reflection wasn't that the aqua blue of pure oceans and pale silver of shimmering clouds; the rust colored light spoke of generation of pollution and industrial 'progress'-but the mercenary wasn't concerned with the decline of the planet, merely the light flung toward him.
He became aware of raised voices behind him, and for not one of the voices being feminine, he would have ignored it completely. The woman was pretty enough, but she was dressed like pilot, and carried the swagger of a pilot. Though he maintained that pilots were, in fact, people too, Juss avoided becoming involved in the affairs of the arrogant. He let his eyes wander around the Promenade instead, seeing if anyone else was going to get involved. That might mean a fight, even with Imperials wandering listlessly- they called it 'patrolling'- about the halls.
A few kids wandered around, trying hard not to look lost, at least two trying not to be suspicious and failing terribly, a few groups working hard not to get drunk, and several handfuls who, like himself, gazed around looking for something interesting. *Yep,* he mused. *Just like every other station I've been on.* some of the characters in the station reminded him of other members of *Shocklash*, the poorly trained, poorly disciplined, and poorly organized resistance group he was late of. Had they not splintered at the first sign of trouble, they would have eventually gotten themselves killed, with Juss right along with them. He had know n that when he joined, and it had annoyed him. Good resistence groups didn't grow on vines, and certainly didn't advertise the way *Shocklash*  had. But Juss didn't have a 'network' of 'contacts' that were required to find good groups, and he still need feel the need to improve on that. He just needed a ride to what he wanted, and a few seconds with his target in his sights. After that...
He shifted just enough that his leg brushed up against his bag, reassuring him it had not wandered off since the last time he checked it. He mulled over the station's regulations that allowed him to carry such ordnance, yet refused to allow it out of the bag. He shrugged, and gazed back out the window. He was on a station; he wouldn't need to shoot anyone.
He crossed his arms and happily contemplated what kind of mess the station would make when it eventually fell to the planet.

Ariq searches his feelings, but finds no clear answer.
Jason nearly catches up to Edawi as she emerges out of the passage from the landing bay to the Promenade. Edawi notices three human males loitering nearby who do not appear to be part of the larger crowd. Each seems to be scanning the crowd closely as though looking for someone, but they either don't notice you or you aren't the person they're looking for. Sajin notices them, too.
Grates, Ariq and Jason notice the men, and they also see that the men apparently all shopped at the same store, because their clothes are identical, but are just normal traveling clothes, not uniforms. Even their haircuts are similar. Each has a hold-out blaster tucked into one of their jacket pockets.
Anandi's eyes are particularly sharp, and she sees what the others have seen and notices that they seem to be whispering to themselves; they must have hidden comlinks.
Artreth is concentrating too hard on treading the line between "inconspicuous" and "fast" to notice the three men.

Jason trailed the alien (making a Galactic Lore check [+7]) until he walked onto the Promenade, taking amoment or two to look around. *This isn't to bad*, Jason thought as he checked out the area before looking for the alien lady.
*Uh, this may not be good*, Jason reflected as he saw her heading towards the group of men. Despite the fact all three looked the same, Jason notices what looks like hold-out blasters in they're jacket pockets (Knowledge (Bureaucracy) +7 to know the regs behind Hold-out blasters).

Artreth refrains from uttering a curse at the sight of an Imperial Stormtrooper standing right in the way of where he needed to go. Turning around as quickly as he is able to without arousing suspicion, he begins a much slower walk back to the central area of the Promenade, trying to avoid contact with the Empire's "finest." Worried that he might have been found out, he immediately scans the Promenade, hoping to locate anyone who looks like a potential threat, as well as a way out if he is attacked. At the same time, he reaches out with his other senses, looking for others with a Sensitivity to the Force.

Ariq sighed as, once again, the Force didn't give him a straight answer. He'd wished time and time again that he had the knack for seeing the future so he could best plot a path to the Jedi rising in power again. In the mean time, however, he would have to make do with what he had.
Seeing the identically dressed men standing around with barely concealed blaster pistols and their conformative hair cuts, Ariq worried somewhat. People weren't supposed to be carryin hold outs. They were illegal. While Ariq had a blaster pistol strapped to his side, he knew that hold-outs were supposed to be illegal.
*Maybe here it's different.*
However, something told him to be wary, so he reached out in the Force and felt for some inkling how this might play out

Anandi takes a sip from her drink as she watches the men closely. There was something suspicious about them, not the least of which was their hold-out blasters. That they had hidden comlinks wasn't too much of a concern, though she had to admit she was curious to hear what they were saying.
When the alien woman walked up to them, though, that really piqued her interest. Whoever she was, she clearly didn't belong to the group. Surreptitiously, she inched toward them, doing everything she could to look casual.

*Hungry,* he thought, rubbing his belly as if to soothe the beast that had growl a warning. *I wonder if they got those spicy fired things that stall had on the last station. Those were good.* He leaned down and scooped up his pack, turned to find a local eatery. As a matter of habit, he ate indoors when he could, in a booth and as far from inquisitive eyes and judging eyes. But somewhere in his travels, he developed a taste for the food served on outdoor- or in hall, should he find himself on a station- vendors and stalls. The openness appealed to him, as did the varied and exotic flavors. He moved to find one of find one of those coveted stalls.
But as soon as he turned, he noted the brash pilot swaggering over to three thugs in shop across from him. He would have never noted the triplets, if he hadn't identified her from the spat earlier. Singly, any one of the triplets wouldn't have interested him, but three in matching outfits struck him as militia. Or perhaps a peace keeping corp. He racked his brain for a few moments, trying to remember that pamphlet he had been giving when he first walked on th the station. He had read the weapon laws, and the park about behavior toward the opposite gender, but only skimmed the rest.
As the scene played out, Juss decided whatever they were, they weren't his business. shouldering his pack, his mind drifted back to food, and he sniffed. Detecting an edible substance, he turned toward it and began to walk toward it. If something was going to come of the thugs and the pilot, Juss planned to have front row seats and sandwich in hand.

Sajin merely shrugged. He had lived for years separated from and undetected by the Jedi Temple, and since its destruction he continued on as he had, although even he couldn't deny the feeling of loss. Loss of someone in particular.
***No***. He shook his head to ward off the encroaching feelings, and merely continued walking, his rucksack held tightly over a shoulder. First rule of avoiding a Jedi Hunter, if that is what they may be, is to *not* act like a Jedi. To not act like anything other than just another starcrossed traveler, making his way across the galaxy.
***Besides, I am not a Jedi… Don't know if I ever was.***
The ex-padawan mused to himself with a sad smirk, but he did continue on about his way.

Ariq's eyes fail him (he doesn't gain any more knowledge about the men that way, and doesn't notice that they are using hidden comlinks) but the Force tells him more. He can't be completely absolutely certain these men are the source of it, but he senses danger and trouble coming.
The man turns to Edwani, his eyes narrowing with obvious suspicion. "That's strange, I don't remember seeing you at any meetings. What was your name, again?"
Jason tries to think of a species he's seen or heard of that matches the alien spacer's description, but comes up dry. It might be that she looks so human. However, he does know that hold out blasters are illegal in almost every system in the galaxy. Stations like Sel Zonn that have lots of visitors just passing through don't bother with much weapon regulation (more trouble than it's worth) but even here hold out blasters are almost certainly illegal.
Artreth reaches out, feeling for the telltale ripples in the Force that its servants leave behind. He finds none. He does notice the three men with the identical clothing, and overhears the conversation between one of them and a young female spacer with white hair and bright blue eyes.
As Anandi edges toward the three civilians, one of them notices her and fixes her with a stern gaze. He sneers with apparent disgust, a look she's seen more and more frequently in the past few months as humanocentric Imperial propaganda takes hold.
Sajin and Gates make their way down the promenade. Grates notices that one of the first stands he comes to seems to be selling something very similar to the spicy meal he enjoyed on the last station he visited.
((Yes! Spicy, cheesy goodness!! ;D ))
((Quick "scenery" note: The Imperials patrolling the station and overseeing security--at least all the ones you've seen so far--are Navy troopers from one of the Imperial Fleet Regiments. So far you haven't seen any stormtroopers. See below.))

Anandi grimaced and now walked openly toward the small group. She about had it with the all the humanocentric crap she'd seen in the last few months. The Empire had taken her family and then made her the villain. She was fed up with it now.
When the woman pulled out her blaster and fired, Anandi reacted with lightning speed. She yanked her blaster from its holster and added her shot to the woman's, aiming for the man that had seen her. He was going to regret having given her that look.

*Son of a…* thought Jason as he ran towards one side of the Promenade, intending to get some cover between him and the soon to be ensuing gun fight, reaching up into his jacket to ensure his heavy blaster is still there. *Guess she wasn't going to be in the mood for talking*.
Jason turned and looked up at where the gun battle is about to take off, keeping a hand on the blaster but not pulling it out just yet.

The sound of Edwani's pistol seems to fill the universe as she levels it at the very surprised civilian and blasts him in the sternum. Smarting off to her was his last mistake; his arms fling outward as he crashes to the deck, lifeless.
As screams erupt from bystanders, Anandi strides forward and squeezes off a shot. It goes a bit wide of her target and strikes a wall at the far end of the Promenade.
((OK, as I mentioned in the OCC thread, Thelma & Louise got a surprise round. Now we're in regular combat rounds, and Darth and Saronian's actions are their actions for that round. Here's the initiative order:

Sajin frowns and breathes a slow sigh as the report from a pair of blaster pistols rings down the space stations corridor. Stretching, the Nagaian uses the gesture to check the location of the concealed lightsaber at his back. With a shake of his head, he continues about his way, leaving the commotion at his back.

The sizzle-crack of the first shot stunned Juss into inaction, and the second snapped him out of it. Instinct took over and went for cover. Civilians all around him were naturally panicking, running away from the noise or collapsing on the ground in turn. Most that went to ground managed to grab what little cover the potted plants and stands had to offer, but several had dropped where they stood. Juss clumsily rolled to a table next to one such couple,and heaved the table over, and slamming the tabletop between the pair and the sound of the shots. The impromptu cover was cheap plastic, and wouldn't stop anything serious, but it did block line of sight; these two were safe from malicious intent for the moment.
The former merc peeked his head over the table, to see what the gunfight was about.  *Oh, would you look at that? The* brash young pilot *is involved. Who would have ever predicted that one?* He mused to himself. Still, Juss couldn't tell who shot first, just who shot *better*. And he was on vacation, *tark it all*. He's not suppose to get in gunfights on his vacation.
*Although, there was that really good vacation I spent on Tato-something. Lots of blaster fire and such, but man was it fun.*

*Well, this might be bad,* Jason thought as he looked over at the two females start gunning down the trio of "civilians". *What is with this place? Been here five minutes and there people getting gunned down. Is there something in the water I should be aware of?*
Keeping his head down and his hand off his blaster for now, Jason looks around, taking stock of situation and checking to see if any civilians/security personel are in the area.

Anadi grimaces as her shot goes wide, cursing silently to herself. How could she have missed this badly? She squeezes the trigger again, aiming more carefully this time. At the same time, she moved toward an overturned table, intending to use it as cover. There was nothing as stupid as standing out in the open during a firefight after all. Well, except maybe starting one while you had civilian witnesses, especially ones that may very well favor the Empire.

Noticing the females continue to shoot and diving for cover, Ariq decided that he didn't need to be in the open while that one female couldn't seem to hit what she was aiming at. No telling what she would hit instead. After diving for cover, he drew his pistol and looked around.

Artreth, hearing the blaster fire nearly the same time as he spots the identical men, pulls his lightsaber off his belt and sheds his cloak in one smooth motion. One Force-augmented leap later, and he has crossed the distance between them and him, lashing out with his blade against the nearest of the three.
Move: Move towards the nearest enemy

As Artreth ignites his saber and leaps across the floor, another round of screams erupt from frightened bystanders. As he reaches the vicinity of the humanocentric men, he leaps through the air again. His target (the man who had sneered at Anandi) is staring at him with an expression of the most profound shock on his face, as if he can't process what he's seeing. The Jedi brings the saber down and across him, cutting him in two.
Despite her shock at the sudden intrusion, Edwani manages to switch targets and fire. The other humanocentric civilian is pulling his blaster from his pocket when she blasts him in the chest, another dead center shot. He crumples and is unconscious or dead.
The trooper near Artreth raises his blaster carbine and snaps off a shot at him. It whizzes past him so close that he can feel a brief flash of heat, and punches a gooey-edged hole through the very edge of the table Grates and two bystanders are hiding behind. He moves toward cover at the east edge of the eastern planter, calling for backup and reporting the presence of a jedi as he goes.
Anandi sees that the trooper is firing into the melee at her new allies and fires at him from her crouched position behind the table as he moves to cover. The bolt travels too high as he ducks into a crouching run, blasting apart a ceiling light fixture that bursts with a strange sizzle-chime sound, showering down on the decking east of the planter.
While all this is happening, Sajin sees a woman with short red hair and the greasy uniform of a mechanic come stumbling onto the Promenade from the west passageway, clutching her midsection as though injured. She struggles to make her way across the floor in his general direction, though clearly she is having difficulty walking and her eyes seem unfocused. "Help me...Help me please." She turns her eyes toward him, manages to catch a breath and focus her vision for a moment, and says to him, â€œPlease sir, help me." As she stumbles and clutches his jumpsuit to avoid falling, two Imperial Navy troopers burst onto the Promenade from the corridor entrance. They raise their blasters, aiming them at the woman, and one shouts, â€œStep away from that woman. She is under arrest in the name of the Emperor!â€
When the trooper yells, all of you notice him, his partner and the woman clinging to Sajin to stay upright. Also, the following people catch the movement of two more naval troopers charging in from the passageway at the east end of the promenade: Ariq, Grates, Edwani, Artreth and Jason. They are running toward the firefight. Presumably they're the backup the first trooper called for, or they were already drawn to the Promenade by the sound of blaster fire.
((Here's the initiative count list again with our new special guests added in. The troopers from the east side have the same initiative as the one who was shooting at Artreth, though they haven't reached their comrade yet:
Artreth 22
Sajin 21
Grates 20
Edwani 19
Ariq 17
East side Troopers 17
Anandi 14
Jason 13
West side troopers (facing Sajin) 10
Injured young woman -6
As I noted on the OCC thread, don't worry about posting in order. Post your action as you happen by and I'll synthesize it into a workable round.))

"Sithspit!" Artreth shouts, suddenly very aware of how stupid drawing his lightsaber had been. Noticing the trooper who originally blocked his path and was now calling for backup, he decides that he's as good a target as any, and leaps again. As he lands, he brings his lightsaber down on the trooper's head, adding the momentum of his jump to the blow.

"Frak it," he thought as he made his next decision, for good or ill. *Dad always said that my nosy butt will get me into trouble.*

Ariq knew that he would have to enter the fight now. First the careless knight, now the injured woman. It was too much to ignore. Running into the middle of the area, Ariq directed himself at the new imps who had just entered the scene. As he ran, he pulled on the Force to protect him. The air shimmered around Ariq as he called on a technique his master had taught him to make him a tougher fighter.

The all-too-familiar hiss of an emerging lightsaber blade causes Sajin to pause, but only briefly. That moments hesitation ruins his concentration enough to where the injured woman takes him wholly by surprise. The Nagaian listens to the woman's desperate pleas as he watches the spaceport devolve into insanity, his heart steeling as he prepares to deny her. But as the troopers arrive and issue their demand, Sajin instead eases the woman to the ground and attempts to tend to her wound.
**"You will find it difficult to arrest a corpse, soldier. Allow me to aid her first."**
Sajin reaches into one of the pockets of the belt he wore and withdrew a set of bandages and medicine as he tended to the mechanic, positioning her so that he was between the woman and the Imperials with his back to the two officers.

One stay bolt, striking the table, sprays instantly molten plastic into the air, and the mercenary's skin hisses as the burning globs land on it. He ignores the pain as the melted plastic bring tiny scars on top of old ones, and digs into bag. Aloud, as if talking tot he couple plastered on the tile floor, he says "*Tarkin'* chaos. Death, destruction and *tarkin'* chaos. We are all gonna charred dead."
His grin, hidden behind his concealing gas mask, is wide as he unlimbers a short, brutal looking blaster rifle. "Ain't this *hummin'*?"
Raising the rifle to his shoulder, Grates sighted down the the barrel at one of the two imperials standing over the fallen woman and her crouching guardian. The weapon bucked as it released it's burning charge.

Artreth is a golden blur racing across the floor, then he leaps, his lightsaber cutting a deadly arc through thin air as the trooper steps aside at precisely the right moment.
Grates' luck is no better, the bolt passing between the two troopers and making a nasty burn mark on the wall nearby. Under fire and knowing their suspect isn't going anywhere, they ignore Sajin for now and turn to engage Grates.
Edwani, however, is starting to look like the galaxy's best shot. As the troopers to the west turn to shoot at Grates she hits one of them in the center of his chest, blasting him right off his feet. He flops to the deck like a rag doll dropped by a careless child, and lays there just as lifeless.
Ariq leaps into view and issues his command. The trooper who is left standing seems confused, his eyes flitting from Ariq to Edwani to the area Grates' shot came from, and back again.
The troopers running in from the east fire on the run at the Jedi who has just tried to kill their comrade. Artreth feels excruciating pain and a shock that nearly spins him around as one hits him in the shoulder. The other's bolt misses his head by a couple of centimeters at most and slams into a section of window further down the lane. The trooper who was behind the planter also fires, but he is trying to get away from the Jedi as he does it. He fires toward Anandi and Edwani as he runs around the planter, but his shot is so wild no one is sure which woman he was shooting at. His shot turns a tile on the side of the fountain into shrapnel. Anandi, however, has excellent timing and aim. She shoots just after he does and he tumbles to the deck, smoke rising from a hole in the side of his helmet.
Just as the remaining western trooper seems to be getting a grip on himself, Jason fires at him and hits him in the gut. He grimaces and crumples to the deck.
The young redhead looks up at Sajin, her beautiful green eyes dulled by pain. "Thank you," she murmurs. She draws her blaster pistol from a pocket in her coverall and holds it down by her side. "Preventative medicine," she says with the ghost of a smile.

That was annoying, Grates thought as he watched his bolt burn a useless hole into the far wall. A charred hole that appeared in the side of the trooper, and the sentient suddenly became a thing, without the help of the mercenary. Shrugging at the nature of the the universe, Grates turned to see the chaos he was so throughly enjoying was rapidly dwindling away to two imperial targets. He hesitated only for a second both rotating his rifle in their direction, wondering about what the sounds of full automatic blaster fire might do to the station's security. He decided the station masters would respond with complete an overwhelming force, surely bringing everyone involved to heel, either by the make-dead method, or by the capture-torture-make-dead method. Flipping the weapon from single shot to "fun", he depressed the trigger.
As the flash of autofire illuminated the creases of his mask, he saw figures approaching his targets. Though the thought of the ceasing his fire did enter his mind- to allow the brash pilot to close into dangerously close range- Grates instead merely adjusted his fire to limit hitting her...on purpose anyhow.

It's possible that the remaining two troopers, heavily outnumbered and facing two obvious Jedi, might have been smart enough to retreat, but you'll never know, because they are cut down in a matter of seconds.
Artreth leaps through the air at one of them. The man tries to duck out of the way, but the saber flashes down and separates his head from his body.
Grates selects autofire, stands to aim over the table and blasts away at the troopers. Fortunately for Edwani, she isn't in the blast area, but Artreth is caught in the hail of blaster bolts and is wounded again. The remaining trooper is cut down, spinning on his heel as he falls, landing face down. His carbine skids across the deck toward the windows for a meter or so. ((Say hello to my little friend!))
Sajin growls his reprimand at Ariq, then scoops up the redhead and charges down the western passageway. In answer to his questions, she weakly points to a turbolift door about 15 meters further into the station and says, "Take that down two levels. Safe house. I'll tell you more when the lift stops." Sajin doesn't detect any enemies in the immediate area. Ariq pounds down the corridor a few meters behind them.
A deafening silence falls over the promenade as the echoes of Grates' blaster die away, a silence broken only by the whimpering of a frightened bystander hiding behind a table somewhere in the food market area. Edwani, Anandi and Jason look around, checking for more Imperials, but there is no movement anywhere in the area.
((Zen, I forgot to tell you last round that hit you took was 15 hit points and knocked you 1 step down the condition track. The hit you just took was another 9 points.

Edwani glances around for a few more moments, before running back to where she started.

"Kark it all." Artreth mutters, holding the wound in his shoulder. He takes a minute to catch his breath as he deactivates his lightsaber and returns it to his belt. Then he retrieves his cloak and dons it, throwing the hood back over his face. He then turns to face the others who were fighting and sarcastically says, "What? Never seen a Jedi before?"

With the barrel still smoking, Grates smoothly lowered he weapon and ejected the expended powerpack, replacing it without his eyes leaving the carnage. It looks like swordsman was clipped, but since he was still swaggering around in that 'beggar's outift- *really, did the Jedi ever think they were fooling anyone by walking around in robes? If the poor didn't dress like that*- the mercenary figured he was alright. He thought the man might be a Jedi, and felt like he had helped the extinction of a prized species; everything becomes extinct eventually, so one might as well finish the job and move on to something else that will be destroyed. The barrel of the rifle hissed against his spare clothes as Grates slid his weapon back into the backpack.
"Sorry," he said to the couple still trying to zen with the floor. "No more dying for now. Maybe next time, *ru*?" The crowd seemed to be heading in a particular direction, and Grates decided it would be more fun to follow than not. Watching the brash pilot loot the dead bodies, he shuttered, and made a detour to the fallen carbine. Touching the dead was reserved for those trained in proper hygiene and ceremonial training. To do otherwise would taint the body and...Grates shrugged away his reservations, and scooped up the carbine, snapping the fold stock into the closed, more compact arrangement. His species of near human was dark skinned, with the lighter skinned members always being sickly. While he had long gotten over believing every pale skinned creature a disease carrier, he still couldn't get over his unease.
Still, he couldn't get over how humming the day was going. He had got into a gunfight, put a random imperial into the ground, found a new weapon, and now was in the presence of a Jedi wanna-be, which was just sure to bring more random thugs that wanna be shot into range. Grates smiled form behind his mask. He even came out of the ordeal feeling like a hero.
As he entered the turbo lift, he mood immediately plummeted. He had forgotten to get a sandwich.

Finding the trooper dead, Anandi slid her blaster back into its holster. She could add one more Imperial to her death tally--which, as a matter of fact, was entirely comprised of Imperials. Well, they should have known better than to mess with a Variil.
She had seen Jedi during the battle--something she never figured on seeing again. She wasn't too fond of Jedi, with them supporting the Republic during the Clone Wars and all. It didn't help that the Republic then became the Empire that murdered her family. Still, she'd heard they'd betrayed the Republic at the end and were cut down by the troops they'd commanded. Someone had finally knocked some sense into their thick, Force-obstructed heads, with DC-15A's, no less. She'd seen that one Jedi stab that one Imperial, so maybe the rumors were true after all.
When the pale alien came over to loot the naval trooper's body, she let her to it. She wasn't going to start another fight. Besides, if there really were Jedi here, she wanted to talk with them. Maybe one of them would join her in her crusade against the Empire. It was worth the chance that they might turn her in. Besides, if they attacked her, she could always shoot back. It'd worked for the clones.
She hurried after them, following them to the turbolift.

Ariq simply nodded at the Nagaian's comment. "I'll be the first to admit that it was never a strong suit of mine, lying. Besides, don't compare me to the Cathar out there. You didn't see me wield a saber into the midst of stormtroopers, did you? For all the troopers know, I'm simply a suicidal human who made a run at the troopers. None of them found out about me, or you I'm guessing. Not many people could have recognized the technique I used out there. It's not that obvious. You kind of have to look for it.

Sajin tends to the woman's wounds and is successful, but can only do so much. The wound in her abdomen is pretty nasty. She's not in mortal danger, but will require time to heal.
Edwani finds a few credits on each man (105 total) as well as the holdout blasters. The civilians really were civilians, but each has an ID identifying him as a member of "Brentaal for the New Order." They also have short-range comlinks (standard, not encrypted) that fit in the ear. They appear to have been custom designed to operate on just ten frequencies which are accessed by cycling through them by turning a tiny dial and are marked as 1 through 10, not as the actual operating frequencies. The naval troopers each have a small handheld comlink (also non-encrypted) and a utility belt with a medpac. There are also four blaster carbines.
Ariq can hear some conversation going on back on the Promenade, but can't hear it clearly enough to understand it. He also sees two more people from his side of the firefight hurrying down the corridor, the shorter-than-averaged dark-skinned human with the breath mask and the petite Iktotchi woman.
The young man who shot one of the western troopers stands up and heads for the west entrance at a jog. As he passes Edwani he says, "Better get a move on. The next wave can't be far off." Ariq, Anandi and Grates see him running down the corridor to the lift, and when he gets close enough to coomunicate without yelling he says, "Can we hold the lift for just a few seconds? I think there are two more coming."

Edwani grabs the blasters and sticks them in her pack, all four Carbine and the two Hold-outs. She left the comlinks, as they would be to easy to track when the time came, but the Utility belts were also lovingly snatched up. "Alright."

Sajin frowns at the wound, staunching the bleeding as best he can before discarding the bloody remnants of his medical supplies.
**"I am Sajin. And I am no Jedi."**
The Nagaian's tone is flat and distracted as he finishes seeing to the redhaired young woman. As more and more of the offenders that started the fiasco on the promenade filter into the turbolift, his frown darkens.
**"And it is for this woman to decide if she wishes to be coddled as such. Although you requested aid, I have done you a disservice in being so forward in tending to you without your permission. May I have your name?"**
He speaks in a very precise and formal fashion, although his tone is softer then when he had addressed Ariq earlier. When all aboard the lift car, he selects the level two floors below their current location, while keeping an eye on the lightsaber-and-blaster toting vigilantes.

((I'm going to jump in here out of order because it will move the story along without stepping on anybody's character getting to act. Artreth doesn't sense any other Force users.))
"My name is Maya Yarro, and no, you haven't been too forward. I owe my life to all of you, especially you, Sajin. I don't know what all the shooting was about before I got there, but if you hadn't been around I would have had five troopers and those 'New Order' thugs arresting me. Eight against one is bad odds even on my best day."
By the time she is finished speaking, the lift has reached the level Sajin chose. "I think I can walk...help me up," she says, raising two hands for Sajin and Ariq to grasp. They pull her to her feet and she moves (a bit unsteadily) to the front of the lift. "This way...I have a safe house." She leads the way through a few twists and turns to a corridor that shows the same signs of neglected maintenance that you've seen on other areas of the station. Three of the doorways in the corridor have orange tape across the doorway, a warning that the rooms need maintenance and are off-limits. Maya taps a code into a security pad at one of these dooors, and ducks under the tape with a grimace of pain. The room on the other side is a small residence, and once inside she steadies herself against a wall inside and makes her way to the bed.
She sits at the head of the bed with her back to the wall. "Since you all jumped off a cliff with me, I feel I owe you more than just my name, but I have to admit that part of the reason I'm telling you this is because I'm hoping I can count on you for more help."
"I'm an agent for Alderaanian Security, and I'm on the station to recover important cargo that was sent here from the Deep Core. Somehow the Imperials connected me to the espionage we've been carrying on there, though I don't think they know yet who is behind it. They tried to arrest me before I could get hold of my contact here. I've been in hiding for three days, and I thought the heat might be off but as you can see"--she indicates the blaster wound--"I thought wrong."
"Because of that and my injuries, there's no way I can make the connection now, and he insists on doing businees in person. So, I'm asking you, my saviors, if you will go. If you can acquire the cargo, I can get it and you off the station immediately. I can also assure you that Senator Organa will make it worth your while, and that what we're doing will hurt the Empire and save innocent lives."

"Well, I'd help anyway, also. However, I imagine that if there other Jedi in this group besides yourself, they're in fairly grave danger now that you've flashed your blade all over the place. No doubt the Empire will send some sort of Jedi Hunters after us. Just like they did during Order 66. So, the best option for any Jedi on the station would be to help out so that they could get off the station alive."

Ariq noticed that Artreth was upset and laid a hand on his shoulder.
"Calm yourself, friend. There's no need for violence here. No doubt we'll need all of us to get off this station in one piece."
Turning towards the Iktochi, Ariq continued, "Thought I'm still waiting for your line of reasoning."

"My line of reasoning? The Empire announced the Jedi had betrayed the Republic. I don't trust their media anymore than I trusted the Republic's, but the clones were loyal only to the Republic. Why would they shoot someone on their own side? The Jedi were fighting for the wrong side--they were fighting for a corrupt Republic that didn't deserve to live! I thought maybe they had realized that fact. I guess I was wrong."

**"Speak not of what you know not, and in silence appear all the wiser. A very wise… Very *Green*, little man told me this once, and I believe it holds true in most things."**
Sajin pushes himself away from the corner he had been inhabiting in the cramp space, affixing Ariq, Artreth, and Anandi each in turn with a level, golden-eyed stare.
**"As of this moment there will likely be Imperial forces scouring the station for those that have murdered three civilians and several troopers, as well as the reported Jedi that accompanied them. Decisiveness and caution are of necessity now, not the hashing out of differences."**
On this last bit he shares a very meaningful glance with Artreth and Ariq, as would a stern mentor would to his students. When he feels that his point is at least vaguely understood, he nods to himself and turns to the red-haired woman.
**"Maya Yarro, I will aid you in this. I have no disregard for this new Empire, or love for the Republic that once was, but you have requested my help when in need, and it would be a dishonor to refuse."**

Jason looked around at the motley crew. *Four alians and four humans*, Jason thought as he looked around. *With our luck, we'll be having half the Empire on us when we get through.*
Shaking his head, Jason looked around for the female he was following earlier. "Hey, did you check the carbine to see if they are fully charged yet," Jason questioned as he gotten closer, then went alittle red as he closed his eyes. "My apologies, I forget my manners. My name is Jason Roenal." Jason stick his hand out. *Hope that doesn't make come off as some love-sick holodrama Romeo*.*

Artreth unclenches his fist, small drops of blood falling to the floor from the new puncture holes in his palm. Practicing the calm breathing techniques they taught him at the Temple, he regains his composure. He then turns to the Iktotchi and says, "My apologies. I did not mean to snap at you." He gives Sajin a nod in acknowledgment of his wisdom, then returns his focus to the matter at hand. "So, Maya, was it? What exactly do you want us to do?"

"Sajin has a point." Ariq looks over at the Iktochi with an impassive look.
*I **really** wish beings the universe over would get it out of their heads that the Jedi were culpable in the Empire's rise. Not to mention this notion they seem to share that all Jedi are the same. Some of us are quite different.*
"Right now we need to see to the matter of getting off of this station alive. We can yell at each other or beat the podo out of each other later on."
Seeing as how Sajin had already asked the pertinent question, Ariq kept quiet at that point.

Not only was his hopes of his sandwich dashed- the crew didn't go anywhere near a food stand, much less one that sold spicy bird meat- but the whole way to the woman's den was filled with 'blah, blah, blah' from the other travelers. Truthfully, the only part of the conversation he would recall later was the pale woman's request. He looked down at her though his mask's darkened lenses, eyes wide in the brashness, and waited for his stomach to stop churning. When he was settled a few seconds later, and odd though entered his mind, and he answered. "Sure. I'm not expecting to live long, anyway."
The walk from the lift was short, and he stayed by the pale woman's side, sure she would bring some kind of great calamity sooner or later around her; he wanted to participate. Strangely, they made it to the gut shot woman's pad without incident- Grates was more surprised no one else was shocked by that than he was the actual safe passage- and they entered unopposed. He glanced around with mild curiosity, noting the entrances the expected Imperial ambushers would come though, and then turned to investigate the room's decorations and various bric-a-brac. The conversation from the halls continued to the hidden alcove, and Grates continued to ignore the droning noises. Eventually, the woman asked for further help- Grates hadn't paid attention to what she was asking for- and he answered exactly as he had the last time a dreadful prospect entailing certain doom was laid at his feet.
"Sure. I'm not expecting to live long, anyway."

Edwani didn't stray far from her new bunkmate anyway, She hummed happily to herself clearly pleased with herself thus far, and didn't object to following the rest of group to the wounded woman's safe house. The Arkanian Offshoot didn't pay much attention to the philosophical debate taking place between the Jedi, even though the thought of turning all three in the credits did cross her mind.
But once Maya started to talk, Edwani turned serious it was all about business with her now. "What the cargo? and how do you plan to get it off the station? And whats in it for us?"

## Re: Episode 1: The Traitor's Gambit

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-27 16:10:17)

Maya nods at Edwani's question. "I wasn't told the nature of the cargo, only that it's relatively small--just a single crate. It's very likely that my contact knows, since he has it in his possession. As far as getting it off the station, I have a ship available. It got here a day after I did. The last information we received from my contact was that the cargo is in or near one of the loading docks here on the station, so as soon as you've secured the cargo you can contact me and I'll send the ship to you."
"What's in it for you a quick way off the station, plus pay from my employer. I'm not in a positiion to know how much, but he's not known for being stingy. Plus, you'll be hurting the Empire, if that's something that pleases you."

"Dead Imperials, mean more blasters to fence." Edwani replies with a smile. There was clearly other things going on in her head, such as perhaps the contact they were going to see would be interested in purchasing some blaster carbine and Hold-out blasters, And perhaps Maya's employer would be willing to float her a loan to get her own ship.

Sajin nods his agreement with Ariq, although Edwani and Anandi earn frowns directly afterwards.
**"…Right. Somewhere in that, the Iktotchi raises an important question: when and where is all of this to take place? And how are we to identify your contact once we arrive?"**
He now stands just off to the side of where Maya rests, his rucksack at his feet and his hands in his pockets. The Iktotchi, Arkanian, and the short one with the breathing mask troubled him, the latter two for their mercenary and seemingly nihilistic intent, while the former because of her apparent zealotry. The others were so very young...

Once you contact me, we can have you off the station in minutes."

*At least for now. Guess the Rendili expo isn't going to happen. Who knows, maybe the Corporation can get something on the side.*

Jason quickly considered his options. *I could betray them, and that'll help get me in good graces with my family.* Jason quickly took stock of everyone there, then looked back at Maya. *But wasn't the original reason for selling Loronar plans was to help planets defend themselves?*

Grates lifted his arm as disease carrier- *pale. she is pale, it's natural, it's normal, she is healthy*- pushed up against him, rest his arm on her for comfort. He was certain she was toying with him, or planning on using him for something, and even this mild amount of affection was going to cost him more scars. As if to in league with a universe bound to tease him with misery, the woman pressed against his ribs exactly where one of Grates's fiancees- he thought it was number two, but it could have been number three- has stabbed him with a particularly painful cutting utensil, and then splashed acid on it. Inwardly, he shrugged; betrayals, loss, and pain were factors of of Grates's life, much like breathing. He saw no need to put anymore thought than that into it.
To distract his mind from dwelling on which debilitating plague he was going to catch, Grates listened to the conversation. Many were professing their allegiance to the woman or her cause, and even Spectre was interested when the mission was outlined. The mercenary had no idea what 'Alderaanian security' was- it sounded Imperial- or who the Senator she claimed to work for, of even the droid named Stitch. He wondered why a senator was interested in a box that some one else had stolen, and came up with smuggling. Something of extreme value and highly illegal, he surmised, as a Senator would naturally be able to get all the mildly illegal goods. *They didn't want the package* vacc'ed, *or they would have done so already, which adds to the price,* he thought. *They- Red and her boss- were willing to take random people to move the item, so they are really desperate and time is running out.*
His mind wandered from genetically engineered organs to dangerous live animals to slaves to one-of-a-kind data of illegal research. *This was high level merchandise,* he decided.  *Very high. And there is no way anyone will pick four strangers for a drive through drop off and expect them to just walk away with the payoff. We are either going to get ambushed, blackmailed, or* vacc'ed *once we get to this supposed transport off station.*
*This,* he thought, grinning so hard his facials scars hurt, *is humming!*

The map Maya has provided shows that V14 (like the Promenade and her safehouse) is in the central cylinder of the station, near the bottom. You take a lift down to the level it's on, and as soon as the lift door opens you see a sign on the opposite corridor wall that reads "THIS LEVEL OFF-LIMITS TO ALL NON-MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL BY ORDER OF STATION MANAGER. THIS MEANS YOU."
Looking around as you follow the map to your destination, you find that you've entered a very neglected part of the station and that people seem to be obeying the off-limits decree, because the corridors are deserted as well as damaged. Many of the lights have burned out, and blaster marks and carbon scoring mar the walls, ceiling, and floor. The area reeks of ozone and electrical fires, and pools of coolant litter the hallways at regular intervals. After winding your way through a near-labyrinth of decrepit corridors, you come upon bay V14, the door to which is guarded by a pair of Gamorreans wielding vibro-axes.

The Arkanian offshoot appeared to be impulsive and somewhat reckless but she felt that she simply wasn't letting things damper her mood and creativity.

Jason's eyes went wide as though something big and scary was behind the Gamorreans. "Look out, it's a Rancor!  **RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!** " Regardless if it works or not, Jason immediately turns and runs down the hallway until he could find some good cover.

**"You know, we actually have legitimate means to reach this… Switch. Or had, I should say. I doubt it will want to work with us after your assaulting his guards, and bringing attention to its likely less-than-legal trade."**
The ex-padawan seamlessly rolls the memory card from the knuckles of one hand to the other, seemingly completely unconcerned with the blaster fire scorching all around him, and the porcine cries of rage just ahead.
**"I suppose next you all could blast your fingers to remove splinters, or headbutt the tops off of blue milk jars. Would likely afford you a slightly better end than a Gamorrean axe through the gullet, and accomplish more I would wager."**
Smirking to himself, the Nagaian allows the snap-hiss of blaster fire to wash over him as he amuses himself with feats of manual dexterity.

Grates cocked his head to the side as Spectre walked away from him and toward the two hulking brutes. He was suitably impressed with her bravo, but the thugs reactions were to be expected. And when she drew her blaster, he felt as if he just gained the ability to see the future. The hiss snap of the blaster bolt, no where near as shocking as first shot of the earlier, reminded him of the first Gamorrean he ever worked with, and most favorite of them all; BurnBelly had a tendency to talk with blasters as well.
There was something that memory, something that tickled Grates's mind but he couldn't put his finger on it. *Maybe the way he talked,* the mercenary thought. *But he talked with his guns more than his voice.* But blasters were drawn, and all other thoughts were shoved aside.
Destruction and mayhem now in full swing- and Grates confidence in both the universe and Spectre- Grates slid his pack off his shoulder and reached inside for his rifle. As he brought it up, the air was filled with shouts of a rancor- Grates had seen one of those on the trideo, and though he was sure the special effects crew vastly over represented it's size, there is no way it could fit in the hall- the sizzle of burning air and...*was some one seriously trying to talk a* Gamorrean *into being stunned?* The mercenary never heard of that tactic before, but endeavored to pay close attention to see if it worked. Stepping away from the wall, he kept the same distance from the wall, yet allowing easy access for Spectre to run behind him, should she feel the need to draw those axes toward him.
*Chaos,* he thought with a grin.

Artreth sighs, not at all enjoying how this was going so far. "You do know that the people inside will have heard this and will probably shoot us as soon as we go through the door, right?" Deciding not to draw his lightsaber, and not really wanting to go claw to vibro-ax with the Gammoreans, Artreth decides to hang back and watch the "fun."

As Sajin and Artreth watch, Edwani manages too squeeze off another shot before the ax comes down. It penetrates the Gamorrean's chest armor and he thuds to the deck.
The remaining Gamorrean is too busy with his swing to look for a rancor, and he brings his ax down into the meat of Jason's shoulder as he is turning to flee. The pain is excruciating, and blood pours down the back of his tunic as he runs away. After his swing he does glance behind him, and seeing nothing but blast door, raises his ax again with an enraged roar. Droplets of Jason's blood fly off the weapon and land on Edwani, the wall and even the ceiling.

The white skinned female was already in the process of turning when the axe splattered her with blood. Leaving a trail of red dots across the left side of her face, a strange counter balance to the blue tattoos on the other side of her face.
But it doesn't stop her from lining up another shot at the second Gamorrean and pulling the trigger of her blaster once again. "Anyone know how much a Vibro-Axe sells for?"

Conflicting, annoying sounds surround him, and the mercenary almost sighed in relief. The group was already shredding around him as haughty ideals and superior attitudes met and greeted harsh reality. Those of superior morals chose inaction of action, accusations over integrity. The dark skinned rifleman, however, did not contemplate such high ideals- the universe taught its student well the futility of those rose colored glasses. He knew action begot movement, and they were moving toward a goal. He also know, from the very few moments of knowing Spectre, what would occur, and was mildly surprised at the other's reactions.
But, he never expected the group to really solidify, anyway. They never do.
Grates ignored the talk surrounding him, lined up a shot on the burly thug, and let his finger twitch on the trigger.

**"Patience. Action without forethought gains naught but destruction."**
Sajin repels from the alcove he is leaning in, as the impromptu battle seems to be drawing to a close. A thought echoes at the back of his mind, a feeling of failure for having allowed this fight to occur, but he tamps it down as quickly as it arises.
But it was something more then that. Part of him wanted to participate, craved the fight as would starving man crave a meal long forgotten. That was a feeling he thought had been quelled, but it returned sharply and unsuspected, and brought along with it a host of other emotions that weren't as easily contained.
The Nagaian took a deep breath, and with its exhale along went the myriad of sights and sounds racing through his mind. He endured through the fight as much as he awaited its conclusion, the datapad memory card racing ever faster across the knuckles of one hand.

Edwani's shot penetrates the Gamorrean's armor, but just barely. He is definitely hurt, but is still fighting. As he begins to bring his ax down on her, Grates' carbine spits out a stun bolt that hits him dead center. His eyes roll back into his head and he collapses at Edwani's feet with a deck-shaking thud.
((Grates' shot was a natural 20 doing 32 points of damage, BTW. Gamorrean go nappy time.

Jason keeps his blaster trained on the Gamorrean as he moves toward the group, flipping his blaster from kill to stun. "Ok, Miss 'I want to smuggle weapons and shoot people just giving me a bad attitude'," he sneered at Edwani, "two things: Number One, Don't shoot unless they are hostile. Number Two, if you want to fly anything bigger than a snub fighter you wont get me killed."
Wincing as he looks at every to see if they were injured, Jason noticed the two they didn't participate the in the fight. Noticing the lady was at least looking around to check on any reinforcement, Jason looks eyes with the white skinned humanoid. "And you. I don't give a damn if you're pansy butt*, peace loving, 'I don't like to hurt people because of blah', why don't you try to at least look like your doing something besides just standing around like a fraking idiot."
With that, Jason twist his neck a little bit, letting the crack fill the air as he moves his head around. "Now that one guy is down, maybe we can get in with out getting ourselves killed. Hopefully."

**"After seeing the Arkanian's facility with a blaster, do you believe *you* could stop *her* from getting anything she wanted?"**
Sajin smirked sardonically at the slightly-built man as the last Gamorrean fell to the corridor's floor. Striding past Jason, the ex-padawan shook his head sadly as he stepped over the two porcine bodies, one slumbering and the other never-waking.
**"You speak of loving peace as if it were abhorrent. Peace would have prevented you from tasting the Gamorrean's axe. And I *was* doing something - this,"** Holding his hand out to the side, Sajin shows man his trick with the memory card, the diskette weaving faster and faster over his fingers.
Just before the door, Sajin closes his eyes and exhales a slow, steady breath. Slowly, his perceptions expand outwards from his body, encompassing the corridor and the storage bay beyond the barricade before him, although the feeling is clumsy and grasping, as would a blind man first given sight. Regardless of what the Force relays to him, he goes through the door to confront what lay beyond.

Ariq walked over to the door and looked at Sajin. "They're probably waiting on the other side, huh?"

Edwani was already kneeling on the ground searching though the pockets of the Guards. Their Vibro-axes already found they're way into her pack. After she was finished with that she stood up, And got right into Jason's Face. "And who made you the Karking Emperor!?! Or haven't you noticed its a brutal Galaxy out there? Oh wait, that's Right, your not from a planet where your seen as a Product and not a person."
Then with a huff, Edwani walked off, back to the Turbolifts. They weren't the first to have issues with how she did things, and they wouldn't be the last. So let the Sith have them!

I don't know about the rest of you, but I'd rather not be here when the Empire starts arresting people they suspect might be related to the previous incident.

Jason let Edwani's words simmer for a minute. "Hey," Jason started, before realzing he doesn't know her name, "miss." Jason quickly runs up to. "Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you. But right now we have to meet some one and I would rather have someone that knows which way to point a blaster on my side. Besides, your name is probably being flashed accross the station." *Hopefully that'll slow her down.*
Jason looks back at the two guys in front of the door. "Rightnow, let's just keep working together until we're off this station. Once that happens, you can go find a squad of stormtroopers to go tangle with. What do you say?" *Hopefully not with a bolt between the eyes.*

Edwani stopped then as Jason came up to talk to her. Her arms crossed her chest as she listened to what he had to say. She seemed to calm down quickly when he apologized for yelling at her, and didn't immediately draw her blaster when he mentioned.
"Fine." She said, still clearly annoyed, as she walked over to stand beside Grates once again. "I'm Edwani by the way."

Taking a look at the wound, Jason decided the first thing was going to get the information that was needed first.

Anandi didn't much mind that the others were all yelling at each other. It didn't much matter. As long as they were working together long enough to hurt the Empire, that was good enough for her. And they did seem to be doing that much.
She walked to the bay door and paused outside it, letting the others walk in first. She would follow in time, but for now she kept her eyes on the corridor as the others kept theirs on the door.

Ariq senses that moving into the storage bay is definitely a good decision, so he steps in with the others.
The deep storage bay is as run-down as the hallways leading up to it, with entire metal plates missing from the floor and a huge, open exhaust shaft near the back of the room. Large crates litter the area, creating the appearance of a haphazard mess, and the air has a distinct smell of sweat and fumes that makes the entire area unpleasant. Flickering lights provide modest illumination, and a burst pipe along the ceiling leaks blue fluid down one wall.
Near the center of the room is an item that seems quite out of placeâ€” a large, finely crafted desk carved from Japor ivory wood, which means that the desk is both priceless and rare. Behind it is an equally fine matching cabinet. Sitting peacefully behind the desk is a protocol-type droid with carefully polished chrome coverings. The droidâ€™s eyes flicker slightly, as though imitating a person blinking rapidly. Near him is a blue and red R5 astromech droid that is quietly burbling to itself, apparently lost in its own world.
The protocol droid calls out to you as you enter, his voice pleasant and carrying a slight Coruscanti accent: "Please, ladies and gentlemen, come in. How may I be of service today?"

You entered from the south. Switch and his desk are at the location marked on the map by a computer console. Also, there are three rough-looking bodyguards--A Rodian, a Trandoshan and a Human--lurking about, but not all of you see them. One is on the north side of the crates to the northwest, one is on the north side of the crates to the northeast and the third is to the east of the debris pile.
Sajin, Anandi, Jason and Edwani spot all three.
Grates and Ariq only see the one by the debris pile.
Artreth notices none of them.

Jason looked at the protocol droid, smiled, then turned to everyone. "Ok, no one shoots. We only had a misunderstanding." Shooting a glare at Edwani. "That means no shooting unless someone decides to crash the party."
Turning to the droid, Jason stepped forward, looking around for cover and noticing the goons. "And I can completely understand your need for security. My friends and I were told to meet up with a being named Switch at this location." Glaring at Sajin. "We were told to pick a container. Would you happen to know of the person or this container?"

Anandi backed into the room after her comrades, and quickly spotted three guards milling about the place. She also notes that not all of her allies see them. Quietly, as Jason and Sajin speak to the droid, she told the others what she saw and where she saw it. She let them do the talking since she was never much good at it, while making sure her blaster was set to stun. If this thing came to a fight--and that always looked possible with Edwani hanging around--she didn't want to kill anyone that might well oppose the Empire.

I am pleased that you and your companions were not badly damaged by the trouble on the Promenade, and you can rest assured that I'll have a cleaning droid see to that bloood you're dripping on my floor."
As Switch is speaking, you notice a tough looking but well-dressed orange Twi-lek in a long coat standing off to the side. Your view of him was blocked by crates until you appproached the desk.
Switch continues. "This is my associate R5-B8," he says, patting the top of the droid's head. He takes the memory card off the desk, holds it up and turns it in his fingers, seeming to examine the exterior carefully. As he finishes this examination, a small slot opens in R5-B8's side, and Switch inserts the card. The astromech droid issues a series of beeps, and Switch nods. "Your passcode checks out. Would you all please join me in a beverage? I have an exquisite collection of them."

"Thank you, Switch," Jason commented as he stepped forward. "But I believe that time is of the essence here. My colleagues were told by our client that the container is most sensitive."

"Actually, Mr. Roenal, though I normally deal in information services, I have been known to deal in such items, and since it appears Miss Ava has some available, will consider these as potential payment."
"But first, let me discuss the reason for the fee. It was a special cargo, and lately some unsavory types have been nosing around the less well-heeled docking bays disrupting some shipments. When Maya arranged for the delivery she mentioned the packageâ€™s importance. I took the liberty of arranging accommodations that would be much safer than any other place on the station. The docking fee for the location it's in is more expensive, and I have marked up the fee for my administration services in keeping the cargo safe where it is." His voice takes on a slightly threatening tone. "You DO want to keep that cargo safe, yes?"
Apparently that's a rhetorical question, because instead of waiting for an answer, he begins examining the carbines with the eye of a jeweler examining an uncut diamond. "Hmmm...these are excellent weapons. Unfortunately they are clearly Imperial issued DC-15S infantry carbines and as such would be much more difficult to move, and attract much more attention if they were discovered."
"Here is my counteroffer: I will pay 300 credits for each carbine, but I'll also give you the opportunity to make an additional 1,000 credits by doing me a small favor. This would leave me with the carbines, you with 1,200 credits and the precious cargo you've been sent for."

Leaning closely to hear, making the best he can to make it look like sweet nothings, Jason whispered in her ear. "You may want to haggle a bit more, and see if the holdouts are worth anything," as Jason touched one of the carbines, lifting it slightly. "After all, going for a third of the cost is a bit less."

If it wasn't apparent, the girl had a hair trigger, and didn't like being told what to do. Edwani was just as interested in offloading the blaster carbine that were traceable imperial weapons, then trying to get top dollar for them. The Vibro-axes and Hold-Out blasters are harder to trace so selling them can wait for a more favorable market.

"I'm pleased we'll be able to proceed, Miss Ava. Mr. Roenal, though your business sense and manner are quite good, I see no reason to waste your time and mine further when we have an equitable agreement. The cargo is in the main docking bay of Blue Deck in a cargo pod marked '1019.' Quite clever really. Itâ€™s the one section that Imperial ships dock at and itâ€™s most heavily traveled by Imperial loyalists. Itâ€™s hiding right under their noses. Once you have the pod open you'll recognize the crate by its size; it is roughly two meters long by one meter wide by half a meter tall."
"Also in pod 1019 is a crate of the finest Corellian ale. I hid it on Blue Deck for the same reason I hid your cargo there: to keep it away from nosy rivals. If you will convey it to Alderaan I'll arrange to get it from your ship to the buyer, and you will be paid imediately. This may seem like a very simple task and hardly a favor at all, but with the heightened Imperial security on the station right now this may be the only hope I have of getting it off Blue Deck and out of the system."
The card slot in R5 opens up again, and Switch takes the card, handing it to Edwani. "This card now has a map to the cargo's location. And here," he says, "is your 200 credits. It's been a pleasure doing business with you."
Just then, you hear the sound of three blaster shots in the corridor outside the storage bay. Suddenly the blast doors slide open to reveal a number of armed thugs outside. Smoke rises from three holes one of them has just shot in the chest of the unconscious Gamorrean you left outside. In the midst of the rabble is a large Chevin, his trunk hanging low to the ground and his mouth twisted in a snarl. He looks old, even for his species. Scars cross his face, giving him a weathered look that matches his leathery skin. His clothes are little more than rags, and a large blaster pistol pokes out from beneath his vest as though ready to be drawn on a momentâ€™s notice.
They walk in, the thugs fanning out behind him. â€œSo you thought you could hide your deal with the offworlders from me, droid? Iâ€™m tired of not getting my cut!"
Switch gazes at the Chevin and says in an unimpressed tone, "Ganga Lor. We meet again. My dealings with these offworlders or anyone else are none of your business. As for your cut, no one else has kept your thugs out of their cargo shipments by paying you tribute, so why should I?"
Ganga Lor's mouth twists into a smile. "Fool! Turn him into a scrapheap, boys! And be sure to make an example of his 'guests!'â€

Edwani snatched her credits and shoved them into her pocket, along with the map. "Pleasure doing business with you Switch. Keep in touch." She replied happily.
Things had turned out pretty good. While she might not have gotten as much for the blasters as they were worth, but she'd gotten hard credits for them, as well as secured the information they needed.
Then the door got blasted open. Edwani drew her blaster and fired.

Jason nodded at the droid when all hell broke loose. *Son of a whore*, was all he thought as immediately moved to get behind the desk, drawing his blaster at the same.
"Damn it, there goes the whole 'let's have a peaceful business meeting'," Jason yelled as he made sure it was on kill. "Hey Ganga, let's cut a deal. You back out until after we leave and you and ol' Switch here can shoot each other?"
Immediately, Jason looked up, keeping track of everyone and deciding where his first shot was going to be.

Artreth sighs. "And everything was going so well..." Artreth, deciding to try and end this quickly, goes for a slightly unusual approach. Shrugging his shoulders so that his cloak fell away from them, he pulls his lightsaber off his belt. He activates it and strikes his most menacing pose, knees bent and legs shoulder width apart, with his left side leading. His lightsaber is held in his right hand, pointed straight at the Chevin, and his left hand's fingers are curled, held under the glowing, green blade. "I really recommend you do as my associate says. You would NOT want to be on my bad side."

Sajin extends a hand out to his side as he stares down the herd of goons filing in behind the Chevin. Suddenly, the hilt of a lightsaber drifts from a hidden holster at his back, and in a fluid arc floats into his hand. The Nagaian assumes a forward-leaning crouch on the balls of his feet with his lightsaber angled down and away from him.
**"The Gamorrean was out, and no threat to anyone… But you shot him anyway!"**
The Nagaian's voice is a deadly monotone, and his eyes seem hollow. Slowly, the pale white blade of his lightsaber coalesces into being, casting the ex-padawan in a ghoulish light. He charges across the broken floor tiles of the storage bay, quick and silent as death, straight at the Chevin. Just before he reaches Ganga Lor he leaps, bringing his lightsaber down in a furious two-handed overhand chop.

Anandi switched her blaster back to its lethal setting and fired at the nearest of the thugs. The fastest way out was straight through them and that was the way she was going to go.

(starting back in the hall, immediately after the last thug was dropped).
Grates lowered his rifle in time with the Gamorrean's fall, and the symphony of destruction and violence eased back into the oppressive silence that always seemed arrive after a battle. The silence expanded, filling the spaces between himself and the rest of the temporary crew, waxing until it pressed against each to them in turn, before spreading out into the doorway, and finally into the room beyond. It pressed down hard upon the mercenary, until it met steady beat of his heart. The pulse of his heart, still slow after such a short battle, beat back the silence in a methodical, unstrained rhythm, holding the silence at bay easily as Grates could retrain a child.
*There was a philosophy in that*, Grates thought, before shoving the notion away. Philosophy was for those looking for reason in the universe, and Grates already knew their wasn't.
He ignored the others as the verbally assaulted Spectre, only snorting aloud once, when one attempted to order her around. Grates has known her exactly as long as he has known the others, but already knew she wouldn't follow anyone's lead save her own. But, one by one, the rest of the crew stood by their morals by voicing their complaints or remaining silent, protesting her actions, or glowering quietly. Grates didn't care. He knew she was just an instrument for the galaxy, and one could hardly say the galaxy knew what it was doing.
As what had become a habit of late, Grates followed the woman he named Spectre into the room, walking at her side to provide both cover, and a better view of the expected brawl. He noted one guard, but dismissed him as uninteresting, and instead focused on the droids. Droids in criminal organizations amused the mercenary. While a living creature could be bribed and tortured, a droid could be could, as well as hacked. Worse, it could be reprogrammed. No one would know the difference until it was far two late. Why such a device would be put in an illegal operation was not understood.
I wonder...is criminal a programmable skill? he mused. Who programed him? Perhaps the R2 unit? He entertained that idea for a few moments, and tried to cast the older astromech droid as Switch, and the protocol droid as merely a convenient face. He eventually dismissed the idea; if Switch wasn't the protocol droid, and could in fact, reprogram another droid to be pretend to be him, then Switch had little reason to actually be in the room. Instead, Grates began to think about the equipment the droid might be selling ,along with information. Did droids have issues looting destroyed robots for parts? Was that at all like cutting into living people for their internal organs? The train of thought was morbid and a Grates grinned.
He had just gotten back to listening to the conversation when the doors were blasted open. While other's wasted precious time complaining out the new arrivals on their brutality, Grate opened fire with his blaster carbine, trying to catch as many as he could in it's wide pattern of blazing fire.

Ariq was glad to see the negotiating had gone as smoothly as it had. Turning to leave, he was caught off guard by the sudden blaster bolts outside and the entrance of the gang members. In his mind, he echoed Sanjin's sentiments. Then he echoed them in his voice as well.
"The Gamorrean was out cold! What kind of cowardly, Hutt suckin', pieces of trash are you?"
Without a doubt in his mind, Ariq saw these beings as evil. They killed a disabled being after all, they deserved no better. Even if his master would have disagreed with that idea. And, these beings didn't deserve to die by blaster bolt. That was too quick for them, he felt. They deserved no better than to be bludgeoned to death.

When Ganga Lor sees Artreth and Sajin's saber, he is visibly shaken, but doesn't run or call off his thugs. Instead he roars, "Jedi? You're in league with Jedi schemers?" His hands shake with rage as he pulls out his pistol.
His eyes grow wide as Sajin charges across the floor with his saber. As he strikes, the saber cuts a gash across an arm Ganga Lor had thrown up instinctively for defense.
Ariq charges forward and throws a powerful right cross into the jaw of a thug on the west side of the group.
Grates aims at a cluster of four thugs on the east end of the group and cuts all four down with a stream of blaster fire.
Anandi chooses a thug stand a meter or so to the west of Ganga Lor and shoots him in the gut. He cries out in pain, and protects his wound with the arm he's not using to shoot. She runs to the small crates near the southwest corner of the room and takes cover.
Switch grabs one his new carbines and ducks behind his desk, and R5 scoots a few centimeters closer to his master so that he is also behind cover. Switch looks at Jason and says, "I hope you'll reconsider your unkind words, Mr. Roenal. That thieving idiot would happily kill you for a credit."
Ganga Lor regains his footing and runs away through a group of his thugs to find cover behind the south side of the crates in the southwest corner.
Edwani chooses a thug near the one Anandi shot and puts him on the floor with one of her typical dead center hits. He's definitely dead.
The thug Anandi shot runs after his boss, firing back at Anandi as he moves. The bolt goes wide past her and hits Switch's desk. A small tongue of flame forms in the middle of the blast mark. Two of them fire back at Grates, and one bolt nearly catches him, but both slam into Switch's desk.
The remaining thug is the one facing Ariq. He is a muscular, bald human who stands well over two meters. He wears a black vest and nothing else above the waist except for a number of tattoos that snake over his chest, arms and skull. He spits a tooth and a mouthful of blood as he pulls a vibroax off his belt and activates it. He swings at Ariq's chest, but Ariq steps back at just the right moment and the axhead misses him by a couple of millimeters.
Switch's bodyguards pull their pistols and each target one of Ganga Lor's surviving thugs, but none of them hit.

Ariq stood back from the ax swing and looked at the bald man with a surprised look in his eyes. His own mind was screaming for him to run, let the others handle this, but he felt that he had to do this. He had to prove himself to the memory of his master. He might not be the warrior his master was, but he would trust in the Force to guide him.
Using the momentum of stepping back, Ariq continued the circular momentum into a spinning kick aiming for the man's head. He felt his heal connect with the man's temple, resulting in a satisfying "thock" sound. As he brought his foot back around, he looked at the human to see the results of the damage.

Anandi fired again, pouring another shot onto the thug she'd hit before. She didn't really care how much she exposed herself as she immediately turned and dived deeper behind the crates, away from the tongue of flame. There was no reason to stand there and make a target of herself.
That target of hers was going to go down eventually, though she would prefer sooner to later. Then she could finally get on with this blasted mission and find the cargo. And if anyone else got in her way, she'd pull an Edwani and shoot them right then and there.

Grates was pleasantly surprised when such a large number of foes have dropped out of the fight. Most have surrendered to the urge to hide, disappearing behind whatever ever cover was convenient. The mercenary didn't follow their example, however, having instinctively decided that such a short battle- with foes so poorly equipped- wouldn't last long enough for it to matter. Instead, he shifted his fire to the two guards close together, and continued to play the beat of his favorite speed metal band with his new carbine.
Briefly, he inclined his head toward Spectre, and then nodded to the Cheven. Almost causally and without waiting if the pale woman followed him, he began to walk across the battle field.

Sajin was all silent fury as he chased after the Chevin, his lightsaber scoring floor plates and causing sparks wherever it touched. When Ganga and the goon ran around the crates for cover, the Nagain didn't follow their path, instead he ran at the crates directly.
Suddenly, the ex-padawan lept and spun end-over-end as he sailed over the collection of crates, landing just behind the pair, facing the crimelord. Inverting his lightsaber, Sajin savagely thrust it into the thug behind him, attempting to bury it up to the hilt, before withdrawing it and turning the tip on the Chevin.

((Saronian's action is listed out of order for dramatic effect.))
Artreth thrusts his saber at Ganga Lor, but the Chevin steps aside with surprising agility and the blade misses cleanly. As he dodges, he calls out loudly, "What are you fools waiting for?" He is shocked when Sajin kills the thug protecting him, but still shows no sign of giving up. "Neither one today, Jedi!" he snarls. Then his eyes grow wide, his mouth hangs open and he falls forward onto the deck with a thud. There's a smoking hole in his skull behind his left ear, courtesy of Jason's blaster.
As Ariq comes out of his spin, he sees that he broke the bald thug's neck, and the man is slumping to the deck.
Grates sees that the two unharmed thugs are standing too far apart to hit with another burst, so he picks one and fires. The thug ducks at just the right moment as he seeks cover, and the bolts go over his head. Anandi sees that Sajin has killed her original target, so she switches to the thug Grates was shooting at. She shoots him squarely in the back and he falls to the deck.
The last thug turns and runs for the door. Edwani shoots at him, but is not even close. He dodges to and fro for a moment, but then he falls as each of Switch's bodyguards puts a round into him.
As the battle ends, there is a moment of silence, but it is soon interrupted. Spigots in the ceiling, activated by the smoke from Switch's burning desk, open and pour streams of fire suppression foam out all over the room and you. In seconds, everyone has a coating of white sudsy foam and the bay generally looks like a fleet of carpet shampooing droids went haywire.
"Oh my," Switch says, standing up and catching himself on the desk as he nearly slips and falls in the slick foam. He looks at R5 and says, "Well?" R5 beeps and whistles, then jacks into a computer socket on the desk and shuts the fire suppression system down. Switch gestures to his bodyguards, calling out, "Come here, I have orders for you so we can take advantage of this development." The four of them shuffle over carefully and stand in front of his desk, brushing off foam as they go. "Now, gentlemen," he says, "first, I need you to hold still." He brings up his blaster carbine and unleashes a stream of bolts on autofire. The thugs fall to the deck, very dead.
Turning to you, he holds up a hand. "I should explain. Just before he died, Ganga Lor called out, 'What are you fools waiting for?' I am 99.95% certain that he was speaking to these men, because he had paid them to betray me. None of his thugs reacted to him in any way or changed tactics, and they seem to only be armed with pistols and axes, so there was no special attack to be launched. Moreover, these men I chose partly for their weapons skills couldn't hit any of Ganga Lor's men, but they could all hit one zig-zagging man after the battle was basically over. Lastly, none of our opponents shot at them, only at you and perhaps me. R5 has already called in...specialists...to deal with this garbage."
"As for you, your group was all that saved me from a career as scrap metal. I am in your debt. Since I deal in information, that is what I will offer. Each of you may call on my services once, completely free of charge, and if it is within my power, I'll provide the information you seek."
"I know you were eager to leave before we were so rudely interrupted, so I won't keep you any longer. Thank you, and good luck with your mission."
((Sorry for the delay...RL issues. The way we'll handle the information favor is as a one-time +5 bonus to an information-related roll, such as Gather Information or Knowledge-Galactic Lore. As with any such roll it's up to me whether it can even work in your current situation, but I plan to be lenient.))

Finishing his spin kick, Ariq saw that the thug's head was facing the wrong direction, indicating a snapped neck. He felt a temporary rush of adrenaline at the thought that he'd used his training properly. However, that rush left him as he realized that he also killed a being. It may have been in combat, but it was Ariq's first kill. This was something that would stay with him for the rest of his life.
He was still prudent, however, and reached down to pick up whatever weaponary the thug had been carrying, along with any ammo, or anything else of use.
Finally, Ariq placed his hand over the dead thug's eyes and closed them.
"May you join with the Force. May you find the peace that eluded you in life."
Ariq stood with his stolen possessions and looked at the others, his martial training helping him keep his balance. He began scraping the foam off of his body and said out loud to no one and everyone, "So, we going?"

"Yes," Anandi said as she holstered her blaster.
She was growing impatient now, and the fire suppression foam did little to lighten her mood. In all truth, it did the opposite, making her scowl grow deeper. She wanted the Empire to pay for what they did to her family, and she was left shooting thugs who had nothing to do with the Empire and drowning in slick, white foam. She was not having fun.
Carefully she moved to the door and worked her way outside, over the dead bodies of the Gamorreans. Clear of the foam, she quickly wiped it off her body. "All right, let's go people! The Empire will not wait forever."

**"…I am no Jedi."**
Sajin spoke quietly to himself as he stood silently staring at the dead Chevin, the nameless man he had killed all but forgotten. He continues to stand that way, even when the fire suppression system goes off, until at last he regains his awareness and looks around the storage bay with a placid glance.
As he strides towards Switches desk, he begins twirling and flourishing the lightsaber about himself, at first slowly and then faster and faster, and closer and closer to himself without touching, until the blade of the lightsaber is a humming white blur. At last he stops, holding the lightsaber out from his body the way he first drew it when the battle began, and wispy white tendrils of sudsy vapor trail from him, leaving him completely dry. Sajin then extinguishes the lightsaber and places it in the hidden holster at his back.
When the protocol droid makes his offer of information, the ex-padawan makes as if to speak but then stops, his mouth clicking shut. He was taken aback at what he was preparing to ask, after so many years. The Nagaian shakes his head, his lank black hair sticking to his face and forehead, yet he forges onward.
**"There are… There are two persons I would like found. A Jedi Master by the name of Nondo, and an Echani Jedi named Xiaya. Find them, or what befell them, and it will be I who will be indebted to you, Switch."**
Sajin speaks gravely and when he finishes, he turns and begins a slow march out of the storage bay and away from the carnage.

The fire fighting foam showering down on him, on everything, almost had him laughing out loud. If there was a plan to all of this...he would laugh at the first person to suggest logic.
He quickly wiped the foam off the lenses of his mask, and holstered his weapon. He paused for a moment, enjoying the scene, before kicking around in the foam, searching for a pair of blaster pistols. These, he decided, would have a purpose. He would remember to ask Spectre if she wanted them, before leaving.

Searching the thugs, Grates finds two blaster pistols and two vibro-axes and Edwani finds 3 blaster pistols and 6 vibro-axes. The rest slid away from their owners when they were shot and are under the foam somewhere. They will only be found with an extensive search or a long wait for the floor to be cleaned. She also finds a blaster pistol, a short range comlink, a datapad and 300 credits on Ganga Lor's body.
As he watches you go, Switch nods and seems to be considering Sajin's words. As you leave, a group of ten armed toughs of various species is moving through the corridor and into the storage bay. The leader, a dangerous-looking green Twi'lek male carrying a blaster rifle, glances at you and smiles with pointed, crooked teeth as he crosses the floor toward Switch. It seems Switch already has his organization rebuilt.
The map Switch gave you includes directions that have you winding your way through many a back corridor. You see almost no one, and the parts of the station you pass through are mostly inhabited by "undesirables," so the few beings you see furtive aliens. Eventually you make your way into the section of the central structure that holds Blue Deck, and take a turbolift up to it.
As the turbolift doors slide open and you step out onto Blue Deck, it is like entering a wholly different space station. The floors are polished and possess a metallic sheen, and the massive windows along one wall--much bigger than the ones on the Promenade--grant the most magnificent view of Brentaal available on the station. Maintenance and service droids flit about from one place to the next, keeping everything clean and ordered. Moving about the halls of Blue Deck are large numbers of Humans, most of them wealthy by all appearances. They pay little attention to the few aliens found in the area, except, in some cases, to sneer as they pass. Almost all the aliens seems to be servants or slaves of the humans in the area, propaganda posters for Emperor Palpatine cover the walls, and the insignia of the Empire is found almost everywhere the eye can see.
As on the promenade, there are patrols by naval troopers, but they are more frequent, and there is a security checkpoint in view about 20 meters away. Fortunately, the route to the docking bay takes you in the other direction. Unfortunately, there are two naval troopers standing near the lift doors. They glance at you as you emerge, but other than giving Sajin and Anandi very dubious looks, they seem bored and turn back to their conversation.
"Are you sure this isn't a drill?"
"When they run a security drill they give us a suspect description to look for. This time we've got nothing...'multiple assailants, armed and dangerous, group includes at least one Jedi.' Unless the Jedi's walking around with his saber out that doesn't really narrow it down. One of the ISB agents told me they got so many different stories from witnesses that the Jedi part is the only thing they're sure about.

"Yeah, we're supposed to look for a Jedi, and meanwhile they've got all the heavy hitters searching cargo bays. I'm sure the Jedi will go to a cargo bay so he can sign up as a laborer, and put 'Jedi Order' down on the application as his most recent employer. Idiots! One of these days I'm going to work up the guts to ask an officer, 'Did it hurt when they removed your brain, sir?'"
You continue on, slipping into a side corridor and taking a couple more tight service corridors to the cargo bay indicated on the map. You stop in front of the blast door, pausing to ready yourselves for the challenge ahead.
((Avarna, you'll need to let me know if you're going to haul all that gear around. Also, I don't recall Artreth or Jason addressing their hit points...now might be the time.))

Finally out of the guards earshot, Artreth allows himself a small laugh at the guards' conversation. Suddenly, the shoulder that had been shot earlier twitches as a jolt of pain surges through it. He grips the shoulder tightly as a reflex, then turns to address the group. "I don't suppose any of you have a medpac or something?"

Ariq looked over at his furry comrade. "I've got a medpac, but not much experience in using the things. Sorry."
Inwardly, Ariq was laughing at the notion of the imps looking for Jedi. If they had any idea of how many Jedi just walked past them..., who knows? Either way, Ariq was certain that they'd get another chance to show them what Jedi can do. It also made Ariq laugh when he thought about the fact that they were looking for someone with a big gun, and they just let that Grates guy walk past them.
(Silver, Ariq didn't find anything on the guy he killed?)

(Crap, missed it already. I was going to ask ole Switch (paying with creds, don't want to waste a favor just yet) where a medic was. I didn't want to go into a fire fight just yet, especially since I'm not at full hit points.)
Jason kept his face normal, but inwardly sighed at the troopers' comments. *Man, thank the Force and the stars that we don't have blinking neon red sign saying the Jedi are here*, Jason thought as made a mental note to call Maya and get her ship ready for a quick departure, before realizing that he needed to see a medic about his injuries.
Once out of ear shot of the the trooper, Jason looks around. "Hey, shouldn't we go see a medic first," Jason asks when he looks at Artreth. "Just to be on the safe side and to load up on medical gear, as well as make sure everyone is up and ready in case we get into trouble?"

A scowl formed on Anandi's face when she saw the signs of the Empire as they stepped onto Blue Deck. By the time they came across the troopers, it was all she could do to not to pull out her blaster and shoot them. By the time they reached the cargo bay, she was visibly shaking with rage. Though she had a few medpacs on her, she was so upset that she never heard the questions being asked about medpacs and medics.

Sajin grins sadly to the pair of naval troops as the group goes by them, shaking his head once they were before the blast door.
**"It once wasn't this way…"**
The Nagaian spoke to no one in particular as he eyed the door, attempting to spy any security devices or alarms along its frame. He glances at Jason and Artreth as they suggest seeking medical attention, especially when they are standing directly in front of their objective.
**"The sooner we are in and away, the sooner we are to safety and you can be tended to then. If we leave as quickly as we came, then come back a second time, it will bring scrutiny to our actions. And security is already so very high…"**
Looking back the way they came, and mentally going over the layout of the their earlier route, Sajin frowns at the door, his hands on his hips. The Nagaian attempts to formulate a plan on how they would smuggle the goods out of the storage pod, but without seeing the actual dimensions of the crate, as well as whatever else thy will be carrying, nothing in his mind solidifies. He tries the access pad next to the blast door, and stalks his way if the door opens.

Edwani shoves teh blasters, datapad and credits into her bag, then trods off after the rest of the group. Again she snuggles up next to Grates. It was strange how she was drawn to the dark skinned man, and she hadn't even bothered to ask for his name.

As they stopped at the blast door- he thought it was the door to the cargo bay, where the cargo was stored, but wasn't going to assume- He out an an arm around Spectre and let his bag slip off his shoulder. Catching the strap with one hand, he was pleased with the weight. Two newly acquired Locc blaster pistols (some one once said the brand was cheap and didn't like dust, but Grates couldn't remember who said it), and the imperial carbine from before weighed on the bag, giving it a solid hefty. He was saddened he didn't have enough room to carry a vibro axe, but he was still pleased. So many barrels and butt stocks would make drawing his heavy out, but already he doubted the next brawl would be easy, so no sense worrying about a little extra trouble.
Surprisingly, Grates realized it wasn't his normal disagreement with life that brought that up. Of course things will be hard, he thought. Nothing goes right, and the 'verse continues down the drain. *So where did the newest estimation come from? Well,* he thought, *we have had two brawls- the door guards don't count- today, both with lightsabers and autofire. That will put the locals on guard. There are reports of Jedi on the loose, and it would be a fool's thought that these two guards are the best tools to search for the betrayers of the Republic. And I am traveling with Spectre*, he smirked at the last. But none of that bothered him, or was even out of place.
As he worried through the problem, and new thought came to mind. *Traveling with Spectre was* not *out of place?* 
And then the last clue fell into place. The droid had said they would recognize the crate by it's size. 'Two meters, by one meter, by one meter,' the droid said. Does anyone else know it's exactly the same size as the Imperial standard coffin? He already decided no one else did. Pulling a coffin out of a bigger crate filled with good booze, in the middle of a heavily secured cargo bay. *Things were going to go tarkin' mad. They are going to go tarkin' mad* again!

Jason looked at the others, then shook his head as he considered his options. "Ok, let's go find somewhere private so we can patch up first."
Jason looked around to see if anyone was taking too close of a look at the group, then looked back at them. "Besides, we haven't done anything to trip them off just yet."
Jason then looked at his pad for a map of the station to find someplace where they can get some medical supplies.

You walk through the blast doors. The massive hangar smells of exhaust fumes and spilled coolant and appears to have seen quite a bit of activity recently. Crates stand stacked up throughout the hangar, waiting for whatever shuttle is to transport them down to the surface. Three doors lead off the left (west) side of the room; the bottom two are close together, and the top door leads into a control room with a transparent window overlooking the hangar itself.
Two stormtroopers stand on either side of the middle door. Another pair is emerging from the southern room. Another two stand by the crates on the eastern side of the hangar bay, with an Imperial officer standing a few steps away giving orders.

Still shaking with rage, Anandi switches on her rapid recycler and steps into the cargo bay. The moment she sees the two stormies emerging from the southern door, she lights them up with blasterfire. She doesn't think about cover, or her allies, or even their mission. The only thing on her mind right now is seeing those stormies with burning holes in their chests.

"This is ridiculous! I'm used to being the hot-headed one in the group, but you're all making me look like kriffing Yoda!" Artreth's shout seems more out of humor than true annoyance as he draws his lightsaber and ignites it, casting a green glow in the cargo bay. *It seems unlikely that I could reach and attack anyone with a straight charge. I'll have to try using tactics for once,* he thinks as he leaps behind the nearest suitable cover, biding his time until he can charge out into the open and go berserk like usual.

...Then a hail of blaster bolts assault the troopers from behind him, and his shoulders slump.
Sprinting to cover, Sajin hunkers down behind an assortment of crates, buying himself some time. He smirks to himself, as just a day ago he had barely made any use of the Force for years, but this day alone he had been carrying on like he was still a Padawan.

Grates noted the storm troopers scattered throughout the room, and he knew things would turn out badly. During his time as a mercenary, especially his time in the Separatist Army, taught him the brutal effectiveness of the warriors. One was a match for for droids, and two mercenaries. With a competent leader- imperial officers were well regarded as such- this half squad of ivory soldiers could shred ten times their number. They- Grates, Spectre, and the rest of the crew- would have to be both smart and lucky for them to survive a blaster fight with this crew.
The thought of luck made Grate think of his own luck. An image of Spectre lying on the ground, her pale skin covered in charred impact craters, brought a chill to his stomach.
The shuttering burst of blaster fire caused Grates to snap his head at Spectre, but the twist of her mouth and empty hands showed she was not responsible. The next instant, he grabbed the pale woman around the waist and spun, throwing the woman toward the nearest bit of cover he could find. The bag slipped off his shoulder during the throw, hit the ground and slid a couple of meters away, leaving Grates in the open, exposed, and unarmed.
*Wow,* he thought. *Usually the universe does that for me.*

This is kinda...difficult, to rule for me (good thing I'm not GM, yeah?). Grates has no close combat feats, and I'm not sure if Edwani will resist. I don't know if you want to call it a standard to gab, and another (or full) to throw) or what. So...

((Because of Anandi's placement in the initiative order and the need for the round to make sense, some of her actions take place before everyone else and some take place in her normal order.))
You all see Anandi stalking across the deck, ahead of the rest of your group and moving to the left, getting closer to the stormtroopers by the southern door. An expression of rage and hate is on her face, she has drawn her blaster and is adjusting something on it. Combat is clearly just milliseconds away, and you act accordingly.
The young officer turns with his mouth agape as Jason opens fire on him. Jason's hand is shaking a bit (probably due to blood loss) and his fire misses the officer and strikes the crates near his head. Then he calls Maya on his comlink. "Hold on," she replies. "Your ride will be there in a few moments."
Edwani targets one of the troopers near the crates and also misses.
Sajin stretches out with the Force, but doesn't sense the cargo pod.
Grates heaves Edwani away from danger like a dancer throwing his partner in a holomusical, causing her to stumble and nearly fall, but she recovers her footing just as she reaches cover.
Anandi's stream of blaster bolts cuts down the two troopers by the southern door, leaving smoking holes in their chest armor.
The officer points at Artreth and calls out to his troops, "Blast the Jedi!" He rushes toward the crates on the east side and takes cover, drawing his pistol and speaking into his comlink. The two troopers who were working near crates with him obey immediately and target Artreth, one shooting several shots to keep him pinned down while the other aims carefully, hitting Artreth solidly. The two troopers at the middle door can't see Artreth clearly (he has taken cover behind the west set of crates) so they pick the most dangerous target they *can* see: Anandi. They shoot at her as a team in the same manner the other troopers did with Artreth, and but they fail to pin her or hit her. Suddenly, two more troopers burst out of the southern room. Seeing two bodies, one nearby target and blaster bolts flying from their comrades toward Anandi, they don't need to ask any questions. They both fire at her, one quite wide of the mark and the other missing her head by so little that she feels the heat from the bolt on her ear.
You see movement at the door of the middle room, and a repulsorlift cargo sled emerges, towing a block of carbonite. A couple of weapon barrels stick out from the front of the vehicle. The tow cable is released and the driver guns the sled forward, moving past the western collection of crates and turning to face the doorway. With a loud "chunk" sound, the larger of the two barrels spits out a large net. Grates and Ariq duck under it as it flies acroos the deck, but it lands over Jason.
((Hit on Artreth: 16hp and 1 step down the condition track. Jason is grabbed and has a -2 penalty until he works his way out of the net, which will be a standard action.))

Sajin crouches behind the crates, shaking his head as he gains no insight as to the location of what they sought. He drew his lightsaber, the pale white blade flaring into being and melting a hole in the storage bay floor as he angles it low. The blade's illumination highlights the hollow fury in the Nagaian's eyes as he darts from behind the protective cover of the crates directly into the path of the armed repulsor sled.
With a wordless snarl, the ex-padawan charges directly *at* the repulsor sled, his lightsaber trailing a ghostly after image in his wake. Just before Sajin reaches the nose of the craft, he leaps into the air in a no-hands roundoff meant to land him behind the driver of the sled.
He lands in a crouch with his lightsaber inverted, his golden-eyed stare grim as death.

Their guns and their armor and the training...but most dangerous, their officers and commo unit. He would have to fix that first.

Jason pulls the net loose and streaks to cover on the south side of the eastern set of crates. He and the imperial officer are now at opposite ends of the stacks.
Edwani quickly climbs up the stack of crates and leaps toward the repulsor sled. She doesn't quite reach it and lands about two meters away.
Sajin's run and somersault are perfectly executed, and he lands in position behind the pilot.
Artreth charges toward one of the troopers flanking the middle door, but the trooper ducks his attack.
Ariq reaches the officer and deals him a terrible wound across the chest. He cries out in agony.
Anandi cuts down the troopers by the southern door and runs to the south side of the western stack of crates, placing them between herself and the remaining four stormtroopers.
The two troopers by the middle door both cut Arteth down in a hail of blaster bolts. The repulsor sled swivels to follow Grates and spits out a series of bolts. One strikes him, doing serious damage and and the rest strike the decking, sending spatters of melted durasteel flying through the air. The bolt and the glowing debris leave burns and wounds atop his scars. The two troopers to the east of the repulsor sled largely ignore Ariq's taunts (they would have to shoot in their commander's direction to hit him) and shoot at Sajin. Both miss and their shots soar past his back. The officer levels his pistol at Ariq and fires, but Ariq turns the follow-through from his ax swing into a dodge and the bolt flies over his head.

*Ow.* The single word roared in his brain. The blaster cannon had caught him under his armor pit with glancing blow, but had melted the armor there into liquid plastic, charred the flesh and burned until his ribs were exposed to the super heated air. Through the pain, he had a vague notion he was flying, with the ground passing beneath him a lot faster than he would have wanted. All too soon, that ground closed the distance, and the slammed into duracrete, sliding only a meter before the ruins of his armor caught on one of the blasted craters. His momentum caused him to flip over and he tumbled ungracefully to a halt.
*Ow.* He rolled that thought around for moment, and then let it repeat. *Ow.*
Through the white flashes in his eyes, Grates spotted a half dozen stormtroopers to the east, all firing their blasters in different directions. Unable to ask for a better position, Grates tried to pull the stubby blaster rifle out of the bag, and found that he couldn't; the materail has become a mass of rags wrapped around the rifle. Shrugging- an action that brought tears to his eyes and pointed the barrel in the general direction of the crowd. His left arm failed to respond to his direction, and his right was pitted and smoking, evidence of slagged steel cooling on his skin. As he squeezed the trigger down, Grates was startled to see his rifle had three barrels that kept moving, but as three times the amount of energy bolts blazed out of the barrels, he quickly became very pleased.
In a meancing tone, he threatened the Empire's best with the only word he could remember: *"Ow!"*
Free: Think *"Ow"* very loudly.

((Ariq and Anandi are presented out of order for dramatic effect.))
Jason reaches the officer, fires and just barely connects. He leaves a nasty burn mark on the back and side of the Imperial's skull, a very serious wound, but not a fatal one. A moment later, Ariq's heel connects with the officer's temple with a satisfying thock, and the man falls to the deck, unconscious.
It's a bad day for the trooper driving the repulsor sled as well. Edwani shoots him in the side of the helmet, and Sajin runs him through with his lightsaber. Sajin turns the sled, guns it into reverse at the troopers near the middle door. Both are able to leap out of the way, and he strikes the carbonite block (sending it flying back into the storage room) and the doorframe.
As one of the troopers picks himself up off the floor, Anandi pokes her head (and pistol) around the corner of the crates she's behind and kills him with a single shot.
Grates may be shaky, but he's still deadly. He blasts the two troopers who were working with the officer and they fall to the deck. They may not be dead--he thinks he sees some slight movement (breathing, a bit of writhing), but it might just be his blurry vision.
The remaining trooper apparently knows better than to try and take on six angry combatants by himself. He takes a shot at Sajin on the run (and misses, the bolts flying over his head again), runs into the middle room and closes the door.
((Zen, I rolled Artreth's con check early and he made it. In 9 more rounds you'll be awake. Also, here's some information your characters don't know yet but you may need to know for your next post: The trooper had enough brains to lock the door. It's a standard, run-of-the mill metal door.))

Ariq looks over at Anandi with a confused look on his face. "Why would you want to? He's beaten and retreated. I say we get the carbonite block and get out of here. Where's our ride any how?"
Looking over, Ariq notices Artreth on the floor. "**Artreth!**"
As he runs over to the fallen Cathar, Ariq sees that he's breathing, but not doing so hot. Focusing his energies, Ariq goes to put Artreth into a healing trance.
After putting Artreth in the healing trance, Ariq looks over at Sajin sitting on the hover sled. "Sajin! I've got an idea. If we get the carbonite block on the sled, and then Artreth on top of that, we can haul them both onto the ship when she finally gets here. And again, when is she getting here?"

Jason knew that the others were looking at him, but he didn't care as he looked at the way they came in. "We better get that repulsor sled somewhere where any one coming in will get blasted," Jason said as he looked at the enterance, thinking of a plan to get them out. "We also need to grab Switch's cargo, don't want everyone on this station mad at us, after all."

"One of you Saber-jockies, Use your UCT to cut the lock on the door already." Edwani offers to help open the door to storage room to get the cargo they needed. UCT was slang that stood for "Universal cutting Tool" and referred to a Lightsaber.

"Ow," Grates replied to a question Spectre hadn't asked. Oddly confused at her assistance, he struggled to his feet, using the rifle as a cane in the effort. He felt the burned skin crack in protest, and the trickle of blood seep from his wounds, but he ignored them as he had so many other wounds. The officer had been yammering into his radio; more help was coming. Fighting to keep his balance, he stumbled his way toward the troopers he killed. There was something about them he thought he remembered, and he hoped he was right.
He paused, leaning heavily on the pale woman- fully aware how much she smelled like expended blaster gas and hay fields- and looked down at his open side. Blistered and charred skin had replaced two deep punuture scars and an acid burn. He sighed inwardly, and moved one. *Those had been a few of my favorites…*

Sajin uses the momentum of the repulsor sled's impact to propel himself at the door as its closing, impaling his lightsaber through the thick durasteel. The metal begins to bubble and melt as the incredible heat of the plasma blade cuts through it.
He had failed again, and the anger of that thought fueled his attempt to get in at the stormtrooper. The ex-padawan saw the cathar get cut down in a blaze of blaster fire, and it filled him with a nearly blinding-fury. He hoped that the stormtrooper watched as the lightsaber effortlessly cut through the door. Hoped that the trooper new that as soon as a way was opened, his life was forfeit...
Sajin was beginning to enjoy the thought. And somewhere deeply nested at the back of his thoughts, he was terrified at that prospect.

Sajin cuts a hole in the door and the durasteel falls into the room with a clang. There is no further sound from inside.

Sajin prowls through the opening he had just created, his steps light and his head on a swivel for any sign of the lone trooper. Adrenaline was surging through him, and a kind of anger he had not felt in years...
No, the Nagaian wouldn't dwell on it as he shook his head, but in doing so most of his rage fled him. He extended his senses through the Force, searching for the stormtrooper, while with his more mundane senses he looked for the door's control panel, and moved towards it.

Ariq sat back on his heels as he felt Artreth slip into a healing trance. Sweat dripped down his forehead from exertion. Wiping a sleeve across his bald head, Ariq looked up and over at the dark skinned psycho with a proficiency for firearms. Walking over to him and the pale woman standing next to him, Ariq knelt again and extended his hand to the man.
"My name's Ariq. I don't think we've been properly introduced. It's obvious that you're injured. If you want, I can do to you what I did to the Cather over there." Ariq nods in Artreth's direction. "It's called a healing trance. It will significantly speed up the healing process for you. However, it means that you'll be in a coma-like state for a few hours. What do you say? Do you want me to put you in a trance?"
(If Grates agrees, Ariq puts him into a healing trance by taking 10 on UTF for a total of 15.)

*Samaritan*, he thought as he looked down at the extended hand through the marred lenses of his gas mask.  *No, that doesn't roll of the tongue so well. Sam is shorter, but…he looks more like a Sammy.* Grates took stock of the other man's cloak, weapons, and obvious youth. *Sammy it is.*
It took him a moment to remember that the... whatever he was, had asked him a question. After another moment, he remembered what that question was. The boy wanted to use his magic on Grates. He couldn't repress the shudder. As poor of a student as he was in school, Grates remembered the highlights of history. Every time one of those mystical creature got involved, thousands died. They warped minds, performed inhuman acts, and dismembered their foes. Worse yet, they had attempted a coup on the lawfully elected senator who was now the Emperor. *And Sammy wants me to become involved with them?*

Searching the officer, Jason finds a short range encrypted comlink, a blaster pistol, an identification card and a code cylinder. Edwani finds that the seven fallen stormtroopers each have a blaster carbine and a utility belt with a medpac. The one who was driving the repulsor sled has no weapon in the cockpit with him, but he does have the belt and there's a blaster carbine leaning against the south wall that must belong to him.
Sajin doesn't sense the trooper through the Force, and Anandi doesn't see him as she enters. The room is barely lit by light coming through the hole in the door, but there is a control next to the door panel that controls lights in the ceiling. There are some crates that have been stacked carefully, and others that have been somewhat haphazardly set aside after being moved away from or out of a dull gray cargo pod with the number 1019 stenciled on the side in numerals half a meter high.

The pulled at the troopers armor, yanking the helmet off before answering.
"No time," he said, looking into the helmet. Grates remembered that most heavy armors didn't come with built in comm units, but had slots the owner could fill with them. This was due to good communications systems, encryption and decryption systems, and data displays often cost more than the actual suit. This meant that if you got a hold of a full suit, you just might be able to yank the comm unit out. But that was normal suits of armor and not stormtroopers. He had no idea what was inside the trooper's helmet.
"Officer was on the radio. We should be gone by now," Grates said through clenched teeth. He moved wrong, picking up the trooper's belts, and his body told him that. "We find the cargo?" The mercenary was both happy and saddened that he didn't find the grenades he was hoping for. Happy, because if the stormtroopers had them, they would have used them. Sadden because...well, grenades were always nice to have.

Edwani practices mauevers with the replusor sled and gets a good feel for its handling and a familiarity with its simple controls.
Sajin still doesn't see the trooper, but he does see a crate marked "Riosh Brewmasters" (followed by an address on Corellia) that is part of the stack removed from the pod and set aside. The carbonite block ended up between the cargo pod and the left hand wall. He's made his way over to the door and opened it by the time the blaster fire starts...
Grates finds that the helmet has a comm system inside, but it will take time and tools to remove it. He also notices that the stormtrooper is still alive, but badly wounded.
Ariq doesn't see the package (of course) but he does notice that the two stormtroopers who were working with the officer (one of which is the one Grates is looting) are still breathing.
Anandi finds the trooper. He has hidden behind some stacked crates on the right hand side of the room. As he sees he's been found, he raises his carbine, but Anandi is faster, and her bolt hits him in the helmet and drops him to the deck.

Setting up the shot (coup de grace), Ariq fired the stun pistol into the man to make sure he stayed out. After making sure of this, Ariq took out his mesh tape and fastened the man's hands behind his back, his ankles, and then the ankles to the wrists to make doubly sure that he wouldn't move.

The stun shot had send lighting arcing through the trooper's armor for several seconds before Grate realized that he had heard a shot, and another moment passed before his pain addled mind registered what the noise was. He jerked his rifle up one handed toward the noise. And whin the pain induced white flashes cleared enough for him to see, Grates recognized the shooter. Slowly, he lowered the weapon, unsure weather he should shoot the man after all. In time, the scarred man was sure, Ariq will shoot him.
He tucked the helmet under one arm, and slung the collected materials over his aching shoulders. Perhaps there was something useful in these odds an ends. Grates hoped the Storm troopers helmet and radio would bear good fruits. At the very least, he thought, I might be able to hear about out impending doom. Without further acknowledging Ariq existed, Grates limped back toward the repulsor sled. He remembered there was suppose to be some good booze in the area, and he didn't want to miss the chance to grab some.

As the trooper collapsed to the ground, a grim smile came to Anandi's lips. It served the Empire right for what they'd done to her family and to her.
As Saijin rounded a stack of crates, she turned to him, then lowered her blaster back to its holster. "All right, you found it. Now let's get it out of here."
Now that the battle had eneded and the adrenaline had had a chance to subside, feelings of guilt started to weigh in on her. Had her actions been no better than those of the Empire? Had she just killed six men like the stormies had killed her family?
*No,* she told herself. *She had only killed armed soldiers, not unarmed civilians.* She kept repeating that though in her mind, ignoring the nagging question of what would have happened had their been innocent civilians around when she'd lost it.

Ariq looked up and shook his head at Jason.
"I don't know if you'd classify me as ever being a Jedi. I grew up in the Temple, like all Force Sensitive children. When I was about twelve years old, I still hadn't mastered even the basics of saber training or telekinesis or telepathy, you know, the basic stuff. That's when Master Barr decided to take me on. Before he showed up, I was convinced that my destiny lie in the direction of one of the corps, but he said that he saw potential, even if the other masters didn't. He took me in and began teaching me basic hand to hand combat skills, constantly telling me that a Jedi who relies on a weapon that can be taken away is a Jedi looking for death.
"Problem is, he died before he could finish my training, so I'm still not the hand to hand combatant that he was. When the clones turned against Jedi, I saw him take down an entire platoon single handed. He did it so I could escape. Since I don't look like a typical Jedi, I blended in easier and got away. I've been trying to find more training so that I could eventually master the techniques Master Barr taught me, but so far I'm still an amateur. That's my story."
While he was talking, Ariq took the utility belt from the trooper and pushed aside the blaster rifle, not planning on taking it, just the supplies from the utility belt. Turning back towards Jason,
"So, Jason was it? What's with you? Why are you risking your hide for this?"

Jason shrugs his shoulders as he bent down to move the stormtrooper, picking him up and dragging him over to his buddy. "Yeah, you guys were frakked on the deal, pardon my language," Jason said as he dragged the body over, then smirked as he put the stormtrooper in a compromising position. "Before you finish taping him, let's put thier arms around each others waist and tie them up that way." *If I can get at least some of the stormtroopers out on psych problems, that'll be great.*
Jason waited for Ariq to let it sink in what Jason thinking before starting again. "My story isn't as colorful as yours, but it involves industrial espionage, my willingness to share information to third parties, a conspiracy theory, and the fact that having a large family is really beneficial when trying to clear your name and get a new identity." Jason started putting the sotrmtroopers as such.

Those of you who are in the docking bay see that a ship is approaching the bay. It's a Baudo class yacht, and as you watch the pilot spins it expertly so that the tail end is pointing toward you. The manuevering thrusters push it through the force field at the space side of the bay, and before half the ship is inside a female voice is booming from the loudspeakers.

Undoing the mesh tape he'd done so far, he worked with Jason to set the two troopers up in an unusual fashion, even going so far as to remove their helmets so that the trooper in the back could nuzzle the one in the front. Finishing the prank by taping the arms intertwined in front, Ariq stood up to admire his work.
*A thing of beauty.*
Seeing the ship coming in for a landing, and hearing the message to get a move on, Ariq walked over to Artreth and picked his unconscious comrade up. Walking towards the downed ramp, Ariq quickly moved up into the ship and found a place to lay Artreth down so he could continue his healing trance in peace.
After making sure that Arteth was secured and buckled in, Ariq heads to the top of the ramp and shouts down, "Anybody need any more help?"

With an excited shout, Edwani watches the space yacht come in and dock. She immediately turns the Repulsur Sled towards the ship and guns it, riding it directly up the loading ramp. Once onboard, she begins to power down, as well as secure it to the deck as one would for any cargo on the ship.
"Hello Captain. I'm Edwani, Pleasure to meet you. Would you like to buy a slightly used Repulsur Sled?" Edwani asks with a big grin on her face, clearly excited about being on a ship once again.

*Booze, booze, booze,* chanted in Grates mind as he limped his way to the ship. After retrieving two bottles, he had to stop twice from truning around, having forgotten what was already in hand. Happiness that the universe had failed to kill him once more- not that it was really trying, after all- he couldn't wait until he had a chance to drink the pain away.

Jason sighed. "Roger that. May the stars keep you safe." Jason then sprinted for the ramp, heading up it . As Jason looked around, he notices Grate with two bottles of Corellian Ale. "Hey, that's not for you," he said as went to grab the bottles. "We have to get it to a buyer. I'll buy you some better stuff."  *I hope.*

Sajin was no stranger to hard work, through the long years of his apprenticeship at the Jedi Temple, and the few years he's spent drifting since leaving it. As the others tramped up the boarding ramp of their new conveyence, the Nagaian began hauling the cargo pod, and whatever belonged in it. He moved with the economy of motion of one who had done this job countless number of times before, in as efficient a manner as possible.
At last he came to the block of carbonite, and took a moment to frown at it. The male trapped within was in obvious pain, but whether it was from the carbonite procedure or some other malady wasn't readily apparent. The ex-padawan glanced back at those that were suppose to be his comrades, and it caused him to frown even more darkly.
With a shake of his raven-haired head, he began hauling the carbonite block out of the storage room and into the yacht, saying not a word.

Jason waited a moment, before realizing some one was missing. "Hey guys, where's the pale guy," Jason questioned before looking back down the ramp. *Crap,* was all he thought as he ran down to help Sajin with the last bit of cargo.
Upon closer inspection, Jason noticed it was a carbonite block with some one in it. *That guy must be reckless to try something like that*, thought Jason as he helped Sajin. "Sorry man, thought Edwani had it hooked to the repulsorsled."

Anandi waited until everyone else was out of the way and aboard the ship before she followed.

She never said a word.

Grates clumsily snatched the booze away from the other man, stumbling up the ram as he did so. *He was going to buy me better stuff later?* He glared at Jason. "I am in pain, now." Shrugging off the man's reproach, the mercenary limped up the ramp. "'Contract' was to get the coffin. Nuttin' said 'bout booze. Bugger off." The pain was making him surly and, strangely, talkative.
Shaking his head, made his way to the replusor sled. Locating an easy seat to reach, he painfully collapsed into it. A practiced twist of his hands and the cork was sent sailing into the windshield. He raised the bottle toward his lips- the anticipation of the numbing sensation the alcohol was so strong he could almost taste it- but paused. He turned to Spectre, and held out the bottle, offering her the first drink.

Edwani walks over to Grates and takes the bottle. She took a long swig of the ale, before handing it back to Grates. "Only one bottle. Switch did want us to deliver it to a contact on Alderaan, assuming that's were we're heading. But one bottle could be damaged in shipping."

As you load up, a strikingly beautiful woman dressed in typical spacer's clothes comes walking into the hold. She has a bright smile, green eyes and white hair, but judging by her face she's only in her late thirties. "Welcome aboard the *Banshee.* I'm Captain Okeefe, but if you just got finished doing *that* to all those stormtroopers, you can call me Sirona." Her smile disappears as she sees Artreth and Grates' wounds. Seeing that you're all aboard and buckled in, she pushes the control for the boarding ramp, and the ship lifts off and blasts away from the hangar bay. "I'd better get you a medical kit, " she says. She heads forward for a moment and returns with a kit. A minute or two later, you feel the shift as the ship leaps into hyperspace.
"After you're done treating your friends, call the cockpit and I'll show you around the ship. I'm glad you made it."
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Here's a photo of Sirona:
![Sirona.jpg](http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b207/cdclukey/Sirona.jpg)
((OK, the trip will take a few days, so it's roleplay-a-rama. And here's the rest in handy list form:
1. Artreth can wake up.
2. I'll be out of town for the next couple of days. I can probably post, but if not it probably won't matter because you'll probably be interacting with each other. Only wait for me if your character has done something that involves a member of the ship's crew.
3. Just in case I can't post...When you call Sirona she proudly shows off her pride and joy. Wood trim is everywhere (except for the cockpit and galley) and the fabrics and artwork are very tasteful. There are small but luxurious staterooms for each of you, a reading lounge with an impressive collection of books and holovids, a hot tub with computer controlled therapy routines for healing (seats up to 4), and a well-stocked galley connected to a dining room with a fully stocked wet bar. There's also a very nice viewport up forward with a couch you can lounge on while you gaze out at space. Though the ship has a cargo hold, it's mostly set up for charter passengers who are willing to spend extra money for creature comforts. You also meet her co-pilot, Crash, an RX-13 piloting droid with male programming and a habit of complaining.
4. My sons are likely to be reading this thread, so keep any...um...character interactions PG-13. Especially if they take place in the hot tub.
5. First person to get bored with the trip, sing out in the OCC thread and I'll wrap it up. Also, feel free to let me know in OCC or by PM how you're liking the campaign so far. Constructive criticism is welcome, and no matter what you've heard about me, it doesn't really raise the chances of character death. ;D
6. Last, but not least, LEVEL UP, BABY!
Catch y'all soon!))

Seeing the striking older woman walking through the cargo hold, Ariq shook his head to clear the un-Jedi-like thoughts that creeped into his teenage mind. Making sure that Artreth was strapped in properly so he could rest, Ariq walked towards the bunks, trying to find one that didn't look too made up. He began to feel uncomfortable with how much stuff the captain had obtained for them. He remembered the words of his late master, that a Jedi should only need his connection to the Force.
So, with that in mind, Ariq found the most spartan of the rooms and tossed in his rucksack. Sitting down on the floor, Ariq crossed his legs and placed his hands over his knees and began the breathing techniques he'd need to enter a meditative trance. He had a lot to think about. He needed to make sure that he was on the right path still for his destiny, whatever that ended up being.

Jason helped secure the the carbonite block, taking some time to see if it was still functioning correctly. *That is definetely one way to get around,* though Jason as he stood up, looking over at around to see if there was anyone else. "Hmm. Wonder where they all went? Oh well, better check out the galley."
Jason immediately headed to the Galley, checking along the way to see if any of the crew or if latest friends are around.

"AGH!" Artreth suddenly snaps awake, shot first in surprise and then, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!" in pain. Noticing they were no longer in combat, he stops himself from grabbing his lightsaber and killing everyone where they stand and settles for instead growling very loudly and viciously, letting everyone in earshot know he is awake and NOT happy.
"The...the kriff happened?" he asks no one in particular as he unstraps himself from his seat and tries to stand up. He ultimately gives up on the later, as his knees go weak and return him none-too-gently to his seat. Shaking his head to clear it, he begins to look around. "Wait a minute...this isn't the cargo bay. Where am I?"

While sitting in meditation, Ariq feels the disturbance in the Force and realizes that Artreth must have woken up. Well, the Force **and** the sound the the Cathar screaming in the cargo bay kinda tipped him off.
Rising from his meditation position, Ariq walked out of his bunk and towards the cargo bay. Seeing the feline Jedi awake, Ariq moved quickly to his side to assist him.
"You shouldn't have come out of the trance so early. I must not be very good at it yet. I'll admit that I'm not nearly as good as Master Barr was, but I try. I tried to put you in a healing trance to speed up your recovery. I guess it kind of worked. How do you feel?"

Anandi let the others deal with their cargo and waited patiently to be shown the ship. She dragged along on the tour until they came across the staterooms, in which she promptly locked herself into the first one she came across. She tossed her equipment onto the bed, then sank to the floor.
She rested her head in her left hand, as she considered everything she'd done in the last day. She'd gone from being a simple bounty hunter to taking down down a squad of stormtroopers when her anger got the best of her. For a long time she sat there, reflecting on her actions, wondering what, if anything, she should have done differently.

"Like a kriffing bantha took a nap on top of me and crushed every bone and vital organ in my body." Artreth mutters, staring at the floor. He then turns to face Ariq, saying, "You're a Jedi then? Or you were before Order 66 at least? What exactly happened? How did we get here? Where is here? And most importantly where's the nerf herder who kriffin' shot me!" As he asks, or rather shouts, his last question, he bangs his fist against the chair arm in frustration. It is clear that while he is angry at the trooper that shot him, he's mostly angry at himself for being shot.

Ariq looks a bit taken aback by Artreth's outburst. Deciding to answer his questions in order, Ariq simply shakes his head.
"I wouldn't say "Jedi". Master Barr didn't believe in the use of lightsabers. He felt that technology separated one from the Living Force. I'm ashamed to say of my own self that I haven't the faith in the Force that he did. He carried no weapons but his own body and the Force. He trained me to follow the Path of the Ka. The problem was, he never finished my training. He was killed during the Order 66 massacres.
"As to how you got here, well, that's simple. I carried you on board. We're currently in hyperspace, heading to drop off our cargo. As to the trooper that shot you, I don't remember the exact details of what happened to which one, but most of the troopers are now dead, and two of them will be going in for psych evals soon."
Ariq couldn't suppress a gleeful smile at that thought.
Nodding towards the galley, Ariq looked at the Cathar. "Hungry?"

Artreth nods, forcing himself to calm down. "Yes, some sustenance would be good." Taking a few deep breaths, he practices one of the calming techniques taught to him by Master Yoda. Once he is finished, he slowly stands up, still a bit unsteady, but able to support his own weight at least. Turning back towards Ariq and extending his hand for a handshake, he says, "I don't recall hearing your name. I'm Artreth, pleased to meet you."

Walking in to the galley, Ariq noticed that Jason was already hard at work on something.

"I'm sure if it was important, I would have bothered to remember," he said, but handed Spectre the unopened bottle with a sigh a painful grimace. The other woman- another brash young pilot- introduced herself, and then quickly disappeared into the belly of the ship. Grates decided he was comfortable where he was, and lounged in the sled and finally happy to let his body heal.
He looked around at he rest of the group as they spread out into the ship. First the woman in the station and now the captain Okiee (*that* name came instantly)...the mercenary decided that the senator that was running this organization- whatever it was- must have hired only good looking women. Grate snorted at the thought. If he was a super rich politician with plans to usurper the government- or any other set of plans- he would hire beautiful women as well. *Speaking of which,* he looked back to Spectre. He still wasn't over the fact she was pale, but...no, she wasn't at all hard to look at, otherwise. She was fire and ice; blaster fire and frigid business. Slowly, she was starting to make sense to him. He looked down at the bottle, and noticed it was closer to being empty than he had thought.  *It could just be the booze, though.*
"Right. So. This were we do some idle chit chat, right? Talk about past, shared histories, and try to find common ground?" With some effort, he pulls off his glove, wipes most of the blood on his jeans, and holds out his hand. "Or we could drink. Joss Grates." He didn't need to tell her she could call him whatever she wanted; he was sure she knew that.

Sajin shakes his head as he watches the short, be-goggled man take one of the bottles of alcohol he had been hauling. The Nagaian finishes stowing all of the goods from the cargo pod, and then joins the rest as Captain Okeefe gives them a tour around the *Banshee*.
Quirking an eyebrow, the ex-padawan was able to appreciate the opulence of the star yacht, even though it was not his preference. He chose a stateroom at random and settled his satchel on its bed, allowing the others to proceed on without him. Sajin then stalks his way out of the bunk, frowning at the gathering in the galley and cargo hold, before making his way into the reading lounge.
A genuine smile crept across Sajin's lips as he scanned the reading selection. Sirona gained even greater esteem with the Nagaian by virtue of her collection of books. Reading was one of the very few luxuries he allowed himself, and something he had enjoyed pursuing since his days at the Jedi Temple.
Thoughts of his days apprenticed to master Nondo caused his smile to falter. Instead of shutting the memories away, he allowed them to wash over him. Each remembered sight and sound battered at the walls of his self discipline, and he used them to strengthen his will. In them he sought some greater insight, until at last he came to Xiaya...
He had thought himself prepared. The anger he felt when she had first bested him. Their competitiveness to outdo one another. Their first kiss after they had nearly killed one another. When he first expressed his love for her. The ice that gripped his heart when Rhuk struck her, leaving her bloodied. ***It had only been a sparring match!…***
The purest rage he felt as he ignited his lightsaber and ran Rhuk down. The deepest satisfaction as he disabled his former best friend with a savage abandon. The shame that drowned him as he realized what he had done.
The creaking protest of stressed wood assailed the Nagaian's ears. He looked up to find one of his hands clamped on a side of the bookshelf, his vice-like grip threatening to damage the veneer. Sajin only shook his head sadly as he released the bookshelf, is stark black hair falling loose around him, obscuring his face. Tentatively, he withdrew a book at random, sat down in one of the available chairs, and began to read.

"Need any help? I'm not a chef or anything, but I know how to move something around the heating element till it stops," Ariq said as he and Artreth came into the Galley. Artreth immediately headed for the fridge and pulled out some nerf steak and started taking some pieces off. Jason let out a small laugh at Ariq's joke before looking at the spices.
"You know, just because you can eat meat raw doesn't mean you have to," Jason commented as he pulled out some more steak and a frying pan, as wel as some herbs and spices. "Letting it cook and saute in various herbs and spices, combining the various aspects of a dozen worlds, is what cooking is all about." Jason looked at the two Jedi. "Then again, is there something against good food and good friends in the Jedi Code?"

Ariq walked over towards the cupboards, and unfastened them to get to the plates there in. He started setting them out, trying to make sure he didn't get between Artreth and his ... *meal*.
Looking over at Jason, Ariq shook his head.
"You'd be surprised what the Jedi code forbade. No attachments, no possessions outside your lightsaber. Of course, that last one didn't really do anything for me, so. The Grand Council felt that such things tended to lead one down the path of the Darkside. But, then again, that's where the council and Master Barr disagreed. Does anyone want something to drink?"
Having found some glasses, Ariq looked in the cooler and saw the wide selection of beverages, not a few of which could also probably be used as propellant. Ariq found some blue milk and got himself a glass.
"Master Barr felt that not having relationships, removing yourself from the life cycle, disconnected you from the Living Force. He felt that if one was to be a truly successful servant of the people, one had to understand how they lived. I know he had a family. Met them once. Good people. Of course, I haven't seen them since Order 66 happened. I haven't gone back to them in fear of revealing them to the Empire.
"As to my personal feelings, I agree with Master Barr, but that could also just be my teenage hormones talking."

Jason finished washing his hands, drying them off and heading back over to the pan, looking up to grab some spices. "I figure the Empire didn't get all of them. It's just a mtter of what those that haven't been discovered are going to do."
Jason dashed some spices into the pan, letting it sizzle a little before grabbing knife and cutting the meat into chunks. "Hey Ariq, check and see if there's some noodles." Once he had a few pieces cut, he tossed them into the frying pan. "I know that with the war just ending a few months ago, there's people probably trying to figure out what to do."

"Hot tub it is," Grates agreed. Slowly, minding his wounds- though the alcohol was already doing its work- he heaved himself up from the seat. Leaving the nic-nac's he gathered from the fallen troopers in the sled, and forced himself to assume a proper, noble bearing. With sarcastic glee, he bowed to Spectre, and offered her his arm, as if he was a wealthy statesman escort his date to a ball. The shape of his battered armor, his fresh wounds, and his malformed shape bore no resemblance to his posture, making the mockery more pointed.
"Trade then. I see the tattoos, and you count the scars."

Initially, Artreth rolled his eyes at Jason's statement about cooking his meat, but once he finished eating, he decided to respond, "Normally I probably would take the time to prepare it better. But I'm hungry, and when I'm hungry I don't want to wait for the steak to cook." After saying this he listened to Ariq and Jason's conversation about the Jedi code with interest. Artreth was not overly fond of some of the Jedi's teachings himself, but he found them far preferable to the pure evil teachings of the Sith.

Jason looked over at Ariq, nodding. "Yep, just pull out a deep pan and fill it with water," Jason said as he looked around for some onions and peppers. "My travels led me to some interesting places, both from a technical and philosophical stand point, but also from a culinary standpoint as well." Selecting an onion, Jason washed it off. "This is actually one of the lunch meals that my family enjoyed and we all took turns making."
Jasan noticed Artreth when the Cather made his comment. "True, but you didn't have to be impatient." Grabbing a knife, Jason started to cut the onion in half, then took one half and cut again. "Matter of fact, grab a knife and start cutting up more steak. We have a decently large group to feed and some might appreciate good food over spacer rations." Taking one of the quarter piece of onion, Jason started dicing it until it was about half centimeter pieces before putting it in with the steak, stirring it around a bit before grabbing some peppers.

How long Anandi had stayed on the floor, she didn't know. It could have been five minutes or five hours. Eventually, she pulled herself up and left her room, after hiding all her equipment so that Edwani wouldn't be tempted to take it.
She wandered out of her stateroom and down the corridors of the ship. Since she hadn't bothered to finish the tour, she had no idea where she was going. That was all right with her, though, since she had no idea where she wanted to go. She just wanted to move around.
After a few minutes, she arrived in the library with its rows and rows of books. Sajin was reading a book in one of the chairs. She watched him for a few moments as she thought of what to say. She knew she had to talk to him.
Cautiously, she approached him. "How do you do it?" she asked. "How do you control the anger and the rage?"

Sajin looks up from his book with a quirked eyebrow as the Iktotchi enters the reading room. Her distress was plainly evident, and her question did not take him by surprise. The Nagaian slowly closes his book and sets it on a nearby end table before gesturing for Anandi to take a seat.
**"It is not easy, nor should it be. Pain. Rage. Fear. These are things that are intrinsic to all living beings; they can no more be conquered than one may conquer breathing."**
Lacing his fingers together, Sajin rests them in his lap and then hooks one ankle over the other as he sits up in his chair. He affixes the young Iktotchi with a golden-eyed gaze, seeming to peer into and through her.
**"Only through understanding can harmony be achieved. Understanding from whence your rage beckons. Understanding the plight of others, whether they be comrade or enemy. Understanding of your place in the galaxy, and what in life you hold dear."**
From over the Nagaian's shoulder comes his lightsaber. It rests gently in his hands, and he looks down as he cradles it. His countenance is serene, but in his eyes is an unspoken battle he wages within himself.
**"I speak of that which I have learned, and yet am still learning. I have not yet achieved my own understanding, but I still search for it. And so long as I seek, I will find. What is it that you seek?"**

Anandi took the chair closest to Sajin. "I seek the destruction of the Empire. I want revenge for what they took from me: my family, my life, everything I knew."
Her hands trembled as the rage started to fill her again. She gripped the armrests tightly, trying to force herself to calm down. As much as she tried, her rage would not go away. When she spoke, he voice was cold and angry and . . . hurt. "They took everything from me . . . Everything! Everything that I loved, that I cared about, that meant anything to me at all, was taken, just like that. The Empire deserves to die and its Emperor along with it!"
She stood up and began to pace the floor, treading a path over the ornate rugs. Her chest heaved as she took deep breaths, but the anger refused to be abated. With a sudden jerk, Anandi spun around and threw her fist into a book shelf, immediately recoiling as pain shot through her hand and up her arm.
She leaned in to examine the shelf, though it was more to avoid looking at Sajin than caring about damage. She was still angry, yes, but now it was mixed with equal parts embarrassment. What had the Empire done to her? She never used to be like this.

Later, Grates stood in front of the mirror, with an oversized- and overly colorful- towel wrapped around his waist and piling up on the floor. He was looking not at his reflection, but at his gas mask. It's collection of scratches and dents had doubled in the day. He would have to get another one soon. He supposed a simple mask would do the job, and he had used a set of rags at one point, but he preferred the fit of breather masks.
A soft groan came from behind him, and he glanced up at the mirror. Under the pale sheets an even paler form moved sensually in her half-sleeping state, stretching luxuriously before pulling the sheets into a clump around her. Grates waited until her breathing returned to slow shallowness of unconsciousness before he looked away. He could have stared longer- she hardly hurt the eyes- but the weight of his stare might have woken her. *And she deserves a rest,* he thought.
The hot tub had been fun, though painful. He was still amused on how easily she had turned cleaning and bandaging his wound had turned into a highly unappropreate game, one they had continued until they found an open bunk room. From there...he grinned in amusement, his eyes traveling from his bandages to the fresh scratches across his shoulders and sides. If those claw marks scarred, they would become his new favorites. They were...well earned.
He glanced back at Spectre, his eyes tracing the flow of her white hair against the sheets. She, he decided, was all kinds of fun. Which meant when the inevitable separation came, she would wound him all the more grievously. He suspected she would shoot him in the back, spearing a nerve cluster, or perhaps across the face, to steal an eye with super heated plasma. Rachel had left him staked to a rock on on the desert planet- Tibble-something?- and even had even lead a trail of ants to him before leaving. And she wasn't as half as fun as Spectre was.
As quietly as he could, Grates strode across the room, and pulled his clothes out of the refresher. The armor was still dirty, having been too bulky to fit in the ship's tiny -*and too damaged to survive the process anyway*- so he left it where it lay. He donned his ripped jeans and his shirt- a long sleeved affair that had since been reduced to a shredded tank top- and gathered his boots under one arm. He would clean them in the hall, so the clattering of the buckles wouldn't disturb the woman.
He had made it to the door and had the mask fitted back over his face when he paused. He pulled the mask off and walked barefooted back to the bed. Leaning so not to press on the mattress, he lowered his head until his nose was filled with the smell of Spectre's hair. "*Sal-lah*, Banshee. Now dream well,"he whispered, behind her ear. He stood and walked out the door.
<span style="font-size: 0.85em;">*Sal-lah*- &#39;A strong &#39;Thank you&#39;, usually for for something that the speaker can&#39;t repay. It&#39;s what you say when some one saves your life&#8230;for the third time.</span>

As Jason works, the savory smell of the meal begins to waft through the ship. Captain Okeefe appears at the galley doorway. "Nothing like a man who knows his way around a kitchen. Smells wonderful."
She leans against the doorframe, arms folded. "We'll be going in and out of hyperspace a few times over the next day or two, so don't worry about it when you feel us crossing the threshold in one direction or another. I'm adding in some jumps just to make sure our tracks are covered. Of course, it will add some days to the trip, but it looks like some of you could use the time to heal."

Jason looked up at ARiq when the Jedi made his comment. "Man, your master didn't take time to teach you how to cook," Jason said as he cleaned the knife he used to cut up the onions. "If you guys had to feed the clones, they would've rebelled sooner." Taking the knife, Jason started cutting up a large, green pepper when Captain Okeefe walks, commenting about the foood and giving them a heads up on thier trip.
"Yeah, that's one of the things the old pirates and smugglers use to do, at least back home. My brother, and me late uncle before him, always try to get the drop on them." Jason finished cutting up the peper before putting it in with the onions and steak. *Wonder how they would feel about em falling in with some rebels.*
"But that's not too bad. We were just telling stories of our pasts and our hopes of the future. Care to join us?"

Hearing Jason's comment about rebelling clones, Ariq looked down at the pot of soon to be boiling water. He remembered that day, no matter how much he'd tried to. He also didn't take it kindly when someone made light of what had been the worst day in his young life. In his inner self, his heart of hearts, he knew that he didn't have the experience that these older people had. He knew that he wasn't as useful in the battle field, or much else for that matter, but his Master was a great man and a great teacher.
Ariq wanted very badly to yell that at Jason. To yell that he didn't know what he was talking about. That Master Barr taught him so much, but never got to finish that teaching, and that was why Ariq was as useless as he was feeling at that moment. But, he knew that if he gave in to his feelings, his anger could grow and multiply, instead of simply being released, as it should be. So, he knew what he had to do.
Ariq walked out of the kitchen, almost bumping into Okeefe, and not even stopping to gawk at her beautiful features. Ariq needed to be alone for awhile. He headed back to his bunk that he'd found earlier. Upon reaching it, Ariq closed and locked the door. Worrying that his feelings might overtake him, Ariq knelt at that very moment, his back turned towards the door. Going from a kneeling position to a cross-legged position, Ariq laid his hands over his knees and began to meditate.
There have been many versions of the Jedi Code over the millenia. Ariq had been taught the most recent version, where the Jedi denied the true nature of the universe, but he prefered the one Master Barr had taught him. One that acknowledged the many problems of the universe, but also encouraged a Jedi to overcome these inadequacies, to become better. Ariq used this mantra to calm himself and bring peace to his spirit.
*Emotion, yet peace.
Ignorance, yet knowledge.
Passion, yet serenity.
Chaos, yet harmony.
Death, yet the Force*
That last part struck a particular chord with Ariq. Though Master Barr was dead, he was still there, as were all of the great masters of the past. All of them were one with the Force. They would help him where he needed it. They would help him learn control.
Ariq meditated.

Grates shifted to one side as Sammy* brushed passed him, causing the mercenary to check his stride only slightly. Having missed the show-and-tell tour of the ship, Grates had no clue about the layout of the ship. But it was a small cargo ship, and it was hard to stay lost. He began to wonder about cabin fever, hyperspace, and the few horror vid shows he had seen when the smell of food leaked through his filters. His stomach growled, and he was reminded why he had left Spectre in the first place.
Following the smell of cooking food, he found the kitchen. The thought of food put an extra spring into his limp, and he walked in. Artreth, Jason, and the other brash young pilot- *she said her name at one point, didn't she?*- were chatting as they cooked. He glanced at the woman, and amended his thought. *Guess if you're the captain, you don't have to cook.* The made his way to the stool, and eased himself on it. *There aren't any more people on this ship. Or if their are, they're…* He mused over the time on the ship, and decided that the way Spectre was acting, if there had been a battalion marching in formation and shooting artillery off, he still wouldn't have noticed. *Still, full kitchen, and plenty of fresh food-* he caught a glance of what was cutting, and frowned behind his mask- *plenty of stuff I'm pretty sure is food and not some other kind of rations food. That means either Captain Lady- not quite sure she said her name, did she?- here has crew, often transports people, or…has a home maker fetish.*
Placing one bare foot on the stools' rung, he one boot on the ground and picked the other up. With loving care, he used bits of his shred shirt to clean up the oversize footwear, undoing the multitude of thick straps to clean underneath it.

Edwani reached over to try and find Grates, but only managed to find his pillow, and hugging it tightly to her chest. It took her a few more moments to realize it wasn't the man himself, and she pushed herself up into a sitting position, pulling the sheet around her.
Dressed in a tank top, and short shorts, Edwani leaves the room she was sharing with Grates, and following the smell of food to the galley. Still half asleep she settles into Grates' lap. "What smells so good?" She asks.

**"…Bookshelves have suffered much this day."**
Sajin smiles enigmatically as the Iktotchi assaults the book case, but his tone betrays his amusement. He stands and takes a few long strides over to the bookshelf, inspecting its damage before inspecting Anandi's hand. Shaking his head at the minimal damage to both, he picks up his book and replaces it on the shelf.
**"This Emperor has taken much from many, myself included. He inspires greed, and hatred in those around him, yet not all within his Empire crave such. Most want what all beings strive for; some measure of prosperity and security in life, and this new Empire offers the illusion of such. Do not condemn those trying to fulfill basic desires."**
The Nagaian squints at the bookshelf, running a fingertip over the spine of each piece in the collection as he peruses the titles. He frowns as he reads the titles of each, not looking at the Iktotchi at his side as he speaks.
**"We have taken the lives of fathers, brothers and sons this past day, each with their own dreams and purpose. My master would say that the taking of lives is a failing for any Jedi, and should not be measured lightly. Fight the belief, not the believers. It is a war waged within, as well as without."**
He exhales slowly, and shakes his head as nothing on the shelf immediately catches his attention. The ex-padawan twirls the hilt of his lightsaber through his long fingers before finally securing it in the sheath at his back. Sajin turns and begins to stalk out the door, speaking as he goes.
**"But, it is not a battle easily won, but one that must be fought all the same; I do so every day. But do not falter in your will to gain understanding, and your darkness shall come to light. Come, let us make sure that the Arkanian has not shot the rest and robbed Captain Okeefe blind."**

She refused to believe what Sajin was telling her about the Empire. "Fighting the belief will get us nowhere. That's what my parents did. They fought for freedom from the Republic, not its soldiers. And what did it get them? Their own deaths!"
The anger surged in her: anger at the Empire, at her parents, at the man who was telling her what she didn't want to hear. Her hand drifted to her waist though her blaster was not there. She'd left it locked in her room.
"They gave up their right to live when they joined up and donned the armor. Not one of them deserves the life they're living!" she shouted, her voice carrying across the ship.
Lost to her own anger again, she launched herself at Saijin, bent on pummeling the man into the ground. There was no though behind it, only anger, only rage, only the darkness.

In the reading lounge, Sajin sees the motion of Anandi's attack out of the corner of his eye and instinctively dodges. Her punch misses him and he turns to respond.

Grates snorted through the gas mask, but waited until Spectre got her answers before answering the transport's question. "Killed some guards, stole a ship, went to buy a sandwich, got a date, and killed more guards." He answered, completing the longest verbal sentence he had made in the last three months. Feeling especially talkative- the blame for which laid at Spectre's feet- he continued. "How about you? You often kidnap heavily armed gangs, or is this a new thing?"

Jason started dishing out some plates with noodles and steak tips when Edwani and Grates walked in. *Good, atleast most of the members will eat,* thought Jason as he put the plates in front of them when Edwani asked about the repulsor sled. *Crap, I want to check it out!* "Well, Captain," Jason said as he turned to get his own plate, "how this group gotten together is of pure chance, preceded by violence and short fuses." Jason glanced at Edwani. "But that's a story where the rest of the group is present."
Fixing him up some food, Jason walked over to grab a drink before sitting down. "The reason I was on the station was that I'm heading for Rendilli for a starship convention, taking notes on upcoming technologies, new ships the various corporations are working on, and send the findings back to my parent company." *Actually, it's to my family.*
Jason took a bite, savoring the spices a little, then began speaking again once he swallowed. "Which leads me to you, Edwani. I would very much like to keep that vehicle around, especially since our next location doesn't cater to weapons." Jason let his words sink a little bit. "Besides, I've been meaning to take a look at some Aratech equipment this might be the closest I'll get, nowadays."

"I've warned you once already, Jason. To stay out of my business." Edwani growled at the man, reaching for her blaster, only to find that she'd left her gunbelt back in the quarters she'd claimed. So she reaches further down to see if Grates might be wearing his but fails to find the weapon. So she turns her attention back to the Captain.
"Ignore him. he can look at it latter. So you interested? I also have some imperial issue utility belts that'll fetch a good price."

Jason stared at Edwani fidgeting for something, her body language betraying her actions. *She should watch her next move,* Jason thought darkly, his hand slowly guiding closer to his own blaster, which was nestled in it's shoulder holster. When she stopped fidgeting and asked the captain about dealing in the loot, Jason snorted, scratched his shoulder to make it like that was his intent, and finished his plate. *Just because someone's not that great in a fight doesn't mean bantha poodoo*. My skills rely more on getting around situations without getting yourself killed.* Taking the plate and over to the sink and washing it off, Jason rechecked the meal before putting a lid on both the noodles and meat before turning to Captain Okeefe.
"Captain, thank you for bringing us aboard. I hope your meal is satisfactory. Have a good evening," Jason said, bowing to the captain and nodding at Grates and Edwani, smiling a fake smile in Edwani's direction, before grabbing his gear and heading down the hall where the guest rooms are.
*Next time she does something like that again, she forget about getting paid,* Jason as he double checked his gear and settled down. *I'm not some one you can just brush off.*

Sajin sees the Iktotchi leap at him from the corner of his eye, and exhales slowly, allowing her to get just at arm's length before he reacted. He sidestepped and pivoted, harmlessly accelerating Anandi past him before he whips a vicious elbow strike to her ribs, meaning to knock the air from her lungs.
**"…If you were Echani, that would have been a protestation of love. But you are not Echani. You are a fool, and I do not suffer fools lightly."**
The Nagaian turns to fully face the Iktotchi, his right hand extended, although if it is a hand to help Anandi to her feet or to ward off her next attack is for her to decide.
**"Whether you confront your rage, and accept it, is for you to decide. But continue to use it to lash out, and you will find only your destruction, and likely ours as well.

*Is he reaching for his blaster?* Grates wondered when he caught site of Jason's hand. The mercenary would kill the other man if he threatened Spectre. The mental image of all the weapons, unfortunately limited to blades and a rolling pin, flashed in his mind, but this was quickly disregarded when the other man proceeded to scratch at some itch. *Relax,* he scolded himself.  *You're too twitchy. Like a blaster fight is going to erupt in a kitchen.* He then remembered a ggun fight he got into in the blathroom of a clothing store, and smiled. That was fun battle.
Using one hand to massage Spectre's back, he grabbed a fork with the other. As he stabbed a nearby piece of spiced meat, he appraised the strangers in the room. He knew nothing of them, especially their plans and their knowledge of each other. He firmly suspected this trip off the station had occurred a debt- in their mind, at least- and they would expect some sort of payment. As Grates didn't have enough credits to warm a chip, he further suspected some kind of suicide mission. *Likely to be labelled for the good of the people or some such rot,* he decided.
Not that Grates opposed suicide missions. He was pretty good at them. Or pretty terrible, as he had managed to survive all he had been on. Some one said his scars were proof that he was luckier than anyone should. Grates found this thought amusing, as he figured the lucky ones died from their wounds.
It bore wondering if this suicide mission would bring a particular man into his guns or not. That was important. Derek was going to die, by Grates' hand if no one else's. It was going to happen, he had decided. A universal fact. One of the few facts this galaxy would, indeed, maintain. It was how it was to happen that Grates needed to figure out. It would be a long and painful flight to that goal, he knew, but it was a flight path he was going to take.
Carefully, he maneuvered the meat close enough to Spectre's mouth she could take a bite. *But,* he thought, *there are perks to it all.*

In the galley, Okeefe watches Jason and Edwani barking at each other with a slightly bemused expression on her face, and as Jason leaves, she replies to him: "It was wonderful, thank you."
She turns to Edwani. "Sorry, I'd love to do business with you, but we're well stocked as far as supplies and weapons go, and I can't really use the sled with a cargo bay as small as this one. Even fencing the equipment would be a lot of work; I just don't have many black market contacts, what with the war, and my clientele. A few of my underworld friends were spooked by all the bigwig Republic officials I was carrying. I don't carry Imperial officials, but it takes time to rebuild trust."

Anandi comes up from her duck with a fist swinging. AT the last second, she switches tactics and grabs the front of his shirt, pulling him close so that her livid face is only centimeters from his. When she speaks, her voice carries with it a coldness, like the blackness of space. "Do. Not. Call. Me. A. Fool," she says, spitting out every syllable.
She lets go of him, pushing him back. Her anger was dissipating after that first attack, it seemed to be all she needed to get it out of her system. "My father once told me that only a fool claims another man to be a fool." Her voice is no less cold now. "Do not ever again try to tell me what I should or should not feel. You now nothing about fighting the Empire. And next time I may be carrying my blaster."
With that, she spins around and stalks away, leaving Sajin alone in the library. She heads for the galley, grabs the first thing she can find and stalks back to her quarters, throwing herself on her bed. She ignores her meal completely as she sinks deep into her mattress, mourning the parents she'd lost to the Empire.

Anandi spent most of the next few days alone in her stateroom. She rarely interacted with the others, but especially avoided Sajin. She didn't want to blow up like she had last time and lose it again if he went all high and mighty on her.
She doesn't come across as grouchy (except to Sajin), just dedicated--if that's the word you want to use. She makes only a half-hearted attempt to befriend the others, listening to whatever they offer about themselves, but rarely contributing anything about herself, except to say that the Empire killed her family for opposing them.

Jason spends most of the time in the kitchen, working on breakfast one day and switching out for supper the next day, allowing various people to cook if they want and helping any one who is interested in some tips. He let's on that he is also a black sheep of the family, going so far as to say that it was his relationship with his relatives and siblings were better than that with his own father, and barely talks about his stepmother and her son with out using very colorful language.
In addition, he asks everyone about their flying experiences, as well as what thier plans are once they finish with this job and possibly the next. He also apolgizes to Artreth for his crude joke, hoping to mend the Jedi's impression of him, while at the same time "apolgizes" to Edwani for getting into "her business", but tries to persuade her that she should bring the others in on the deal since they all helped in "acquiring" them, especially since Jason might be able to get a meeting set up after delivering the cargo.

Grates sat alone on the stairs in the cargo hold, rolling a screw along his top teeth with his tongue, feeling it's ridges clack against his incisors. His bare feet gripped at the metal grating of the steps, bringing a light creaking to the bay that echoed just enough that the silence didn't feel all consuming. Next to him, his fully restored boots sat, the cleaning rags and oils untouched since he set them down over an hour ago. Despite being fully repaired and maintained, he had intended to continue to polish them. They were his excuse for leaving the comfort of the warm body currently occupying the bed. But, once in the cargo bay, he had sat down, suddenly weary, and simply stared at the far wall.
Ariq, had just walked out, looking both exhausted and exalted, before Grates had entered, and the mercenary had noted the odd scuff marks all over the floor, walls, crates, and even the speeder. Earlier, Grates had watched the young man going about his warrior katas, and despite his preference to long barreled noise makers, the scarred man had been impressed. The boy was very quick and graceful, and had gone all over the place. It took several minutes before Grates realized there was a pattern to Ariq's movements. Only then did it dawn on the mercenary that the young warrior was doing rotes and drills. Rotes and drills that were conducted with smooth precision on over varied terrain. *My, my, Sammy boy*, Grates had thought. *Gotta get you into a bar fight, see what happens then.* The merceanry snorted. *But, with my luck, you don't drink.*
But that had been almost twelve hours ago, before he had returned with Spectre to the room. He was exhausted. Keeping Spectre's company was...tiring. In a very pleasant way. He had even taken the time to admire the growing collection of scratches across his back. He was very fond of the time they spent out of the bedroom as well, even though their personalities were completely opposite. Where he took things as the came, rolling with the waves and taking the bruises as they came, she *was* the wave, cresting and crashing in turn. Even though he knew- he *knew*, without a single ounce of doubt or bit of hope in another option- that she would betray, humiliate, and render him a bleeding, hollow husk, he could bring himself to divest himself of her. After the moment in the kitchen he even took to carrying the blaster pistol he picked up around. Just in case.
Everything went bad, in the end. The greater the height, the harder the impact. With Spectre...she might even be enough to kill him. Grates doubted it, though. They always say death stops the hurting.
He glanced down at his belt, where the impromptu holster held the pistol to his side. The hand made device was hideous, like it was crafted from left over armor peieces, belts, and shredded shirt. Which it had been. But the holster fit perfectly, and was durable, the two things Grates was going for. He would have to buy another one, when he had the chance. And armor, as well; he last set was slagged beyond repair. He started building a shopping list. A commlink- communication came before more firepower, and he was working with at least one more person- new clothes, another backpack, some power packs...and socks. He glanced at his bare feet. *Yeah, socks.*
Finally, he felt the resistance of his insomnia being to fade, and he stood. Careful to replace his mask before going where another of the crew could see him, he padded toward the corridor. Given a little luck, he would make it back to the room with enough time to shower and nap before Spectre woke up. He grinned behind the mask. If he wasn't that lucky...he wouldn't mind at all.

Edwani spent a good deal of her time on the ship, attending to her stock. Each blaster was stripped and cleaned, and ensured to be in perfect working order, they're power backs charged before being carefully placed in a packing crate she'd borrowed from the captain without exactly asking. But it had been empty when she started so didn't figure Okeefe would mind. The Utility Bests were also cleaned, and anything that wasn't standard was removed and left for the Captain to pay for the cost of the crate.
Then she turned her attention to the Repulsor Sled, repairing any damage and doing the little things she could do to improve its performance without actually replacing parts. This was to increase its value for when they finally found a buyer for it, and that part of her simply wanted it to be in perfect working order.
(Mechanics +13 Taking 20)
At night, she would return to her room, grease covering random locations on her body. She eagerly went to bed with Grates, rarely waking up before him. Edwani gladly at the meals prepared by the captain and Jason, but started to wear her blaster around the ship as well, just in case. Seeing the mess Grates armor was in. She did her best to make it serviceable once again. (Mechanics +13)

Edwani finds that her repairs and tweaks are quite effective. The equipment looks like new and the sled is functioning perfectly.
It's very early in the ship's morning when Crash comes around to each stateroom and the other areas of the ship where he can find each of you, and lets you know that you'll be arriving at Alderaan within the hour. All passengers are welcome to join the flight crew in the cockpit or take in the view from the observation lounge.
((Later...))
A light blinks on the console and Sirona pushes a lever, causing the whirling blue to be replaced by a million stars streaking back into place. The beautiful blue and green world of Alderaan fills the forward viewport, and Crash responds to the planetary hails to plot a landing route towards Aldera, the capital. As you cruise over grassy fields and valleys and countless seas, you are impressed by how pristine and clean the world looks. Most settlements are quite difficult to see from the air because they are so well integrated into the natural terrain.
Aldera appears to be a small city built into a beautiful mountain valley. Its tallest buildings are rounded and sweeping, mostly with gleaming metal casings. Alderaâ€™s spaceport control tower clears the ship to land at the Royal Palaceâ€™s landing pad. The *Banshee* alights gently on a small pad. It appears to be dawn, and the air is cool and misty.
When you disembark, you are immediately greeted by several Alderaanian honor guards in robes and steel clasps and one of Bail Organaâ€™s servants, a tall, well-dressed and attractive human female with full lips and black hair. You hear Sirona telling Crash to oversee unloading and resupply as the servant clears her throat to speak.
â€œGood morning. My name is Sheltay Retrac, and I'm on Senator Organa's household staff. If you'll come with me, we have some refreshments and information for you.â€
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

</details>

As you are escorted into the palace and the soaring Grand Hall, you see several labor droids with hollow torsoes stomping past you toward the *Banshee.* One of them rotates its head towards you as it passes. You see a number of protocol droids in the halls.
Sheltay ushers you to a small balcony where servant droids are placing trays of fruits, pastries and hot caf. "Please be seated and enjoy the view," she says. "The Senator is on his way to greet you prior to his morning briefing." She bows slightly, turns, and leaves. Only now do you begin to realize the magnitude of your discovery. To be invited into the palace of an Imperial Senator and famous diplomat like Bail Organa is something that most citizens can only dream about. The Senatorâ€™s power shapes the lives of billions.
The food is excellent, the caf perfectly brewed, and you have a stunning view of a mountain range. The air is cool and refreshing, especially after days aboard ship. You watch the sun rise over the mountains. The servant droids hover nearby, ready to attend to any further needs you have.
The doors to the Grand Hall open, and in strides a middle-aged man who has a well-kept goatee and is wearing Senatorial robes. Easily recognizable as Bail Organa, he smiles and nods to the servants before joining you on the balcony. â€œWelcome to Alderaan,â€ he says. â€œI wish we were meeting under more pleasant circumstances, but unfortunately the Empire makes almost everything unpleasant. If you'll come with me, I have some important information to share with you.â€ You walk together down the Grand Hall and into a small antechamber set up as a briefing room, with a holoprojector platform and a few rows of seats set in a semicircle.
â€œIâ€™ve asked you to join me today because Maya Yarrow, my agent, seems to think you can be trusted. By the way, she is safe now, and is no longer on the station. You have my personal thanks for saving her life. It must have been especially difficult for you Jedi. There are far too few of you left, and it would have been very easy for you to remain hidden. Since you worked hard to help Maya, I believe I can put my faith in you as well. I have a task that needs to be completed, but unfortunately my status as a Senator prevents me from taking care of it myself, or even from sending someone directly associated with the Royal Family...recent events have made me realize I need to be more cautious in the future.â€
He activates the holoprojector, causing a planet to appear.
â€œThe planet Felucia was ravaged during the Clone Wars, but once the fighting was over, the Empire set up some permanent facilities on the world. This is the one that concerns me,â€ he says, zooming in to show a blinking dot near the equator.
â€œNothing largeâ€”It used to be a communications facility. Now itâ€™s just a small garrison where they keep prisoners out of the way. Some months ago, I was contacted by an Imperial Admiral who was disillusioned with the way the Empire had twisted the once-great Republic, and he began feeding me sensitive information. A little over a week ago, that communication stopped. The agent you brought here from Brentaal has just told me that the Admiral has been taken to Felucia, where he is being held against his will. Iâ€™d like you to learn what has become of him, and rescue him if you can.â€
He touches another control and a wall panel presents an image of the Admiral. Heâ€™s wearing civilian clothes and his hair is long for a military man, and he has soft blue eyes.

Artreth leans on the rail of the balcony, facing the view of the mountains and enjoying it as the senator talks. When he finishes and asks if anyone had questions, Artreth thinks over his question, deciding what he needs to ask. Finally, he turns around and asks simply, "When do we leave?"

Edwani raises her hand. "Would you like to buy some blasters and a slightly used Repulsor Sled? How about backing some of my business ventures, All I really need is money for a ship."
A true brash pilot, Edwani was more concerned about the potential for business and excitement then the fight against the Empire. The Arkanian Offshoot was used to being repressed, so that didn't truly concern her.

*She'd probably just try to shoot me instead.*
Pushing himself out of the seat he'd been sitting in and standing next to Artreth, Ariq nods his head in agreement.
"I agree, when do we leave? We should probably restock before we go anywhere. Also, what's the environment like on this Felucia?"

At the mention of Felucia, Anandi was caught by surprise. She'd heard about it during the Clone Wars, and how both sides had butchered each other there. Following her training with the Separatist Army, she had received orders to go to Felucia. The thought terrified her father, who had pulled some strings to get her posted elsewhere. It didn't matter, though, as the war ended before she ever saw any action.
Now it looked like she was going anyway but this time as part of another war. And she was going to be rescuing a former Republic soldier. He had changed sides, now, against the Empire, but Anandi wasn't sure what to think about him. Well, she could make up her mind when she met him.
She crossed her arms over her chest and leaned back against the wall, listening to the other questions, and spoke up only when she had something to add. "What's the garrison like there? How many troops and other equipment? You know, walkers, turrets, etcetera. We need to know what we're going up against."

Jason resited the effort to roll his eyes at Ed and looked at the holgram of the Imperial Admiral. Humming silently to himself, Jason tries to recall what he learned on various planets in the Galaxy, especially one that is as famous as Felucia. Anandi voicing her concerns almost brought a smile to his face, raising her value in his mind. *Wonder if she wants to pilot a frieghter.*
"I agree that we should move out as soon as possible," Jason said a he looked over at everyone else, "but we should be careful. Any more information on this place before we come in, Senator?"

((Sorry to rephrase your posts, but this was giving me some trouble so I just put your questions in among Organa's answers.))
Artreth asks, "When do we leave?"
Organa smiles. "I appreciate your enthusiasm. You can leave as soon as you're ready, though we do have some more mission briefing to accomplish."
Edwani raises her hand. "Would you like to buy some blasters and a slightly used Repulsor Sled? How about backing some of my business ventures, all I really need is money for a ship."
"We're all set for weapons and cargo equipment," the Senator says, "and I don't really handle the family's investments. However, you should have a place to dispose of those weapons when you finish this mission."
Ariq stands and says, "We should probably restock before we go anywhere. Also, what's the environment like on this Felucia?"
Organa nods. â€œEach of you will receive 2,000 credits up front, out of which you can secure provisions and keep the rest. If things go well, I will guarantee more work when you return. Additionally, if the Admiral has as much information as I believe he does, this could be an excellent chance to strike a blow at the Galactic Empire.â€
"As for Felucia, dense overgrowth, flesh eating diseases, shrieking nocturnal predators, and huge fungi are the order of the day there. Itâ€™s a wild, untamed planet, and you should be careful to avoid much of the local wildlife.â€
Anandi speaks up: "What's the garrison like there? How many troops and other equipment? You know, walkers, turrets, etcetera. We need to know what we're going up against."
"The Imperial presence on Felucia is light," he responds. "The facility itself is a secret, accessed mainly by air and surrounded by swamps and jungles. They do not advertise its presence with large numbers of troops, and it is far from the settlements. Our knowledge of the facilityâ€™s existence is our greatest advantage. Additionally, you shouldnâ€™t be going anywhere near the planetâ€™s major cities, so you should be able to travel undetected."
His expression darkens. "Thereâ€™s just one other thing --we believe this facility has a point-defense turret guarding it. You can't land on it or near it. Unfortunately, that means you'll have to hike to from some distance away."
He looks around at your band, seeing if there are further questions or comments.

Jason pursed his lips as he let the information sinks in. *Ok, that makes sense, especially about secret prison*, Jason thought as he reflected on his visit to Dac about six months ago. *Rumor was going around that various people were disappearing due to 'collaborating' with the enemy.*
When Senator Organa told Ed what he can and can't do, Jason had to control himself from letting a crap eating grin go from ear to ear and only let out a smirk that he tried to cover with his hand. *That'll teach her. She should research her market before going around trying to hawk wares that no one wants.*
"Thank you, Senator, but what about the locals? Is there any one there that might be able to help us once we get in," asked Jason as he brought his hand down, looking at the group, going over a shopping list of gear he may want to bring in, and hopes to hear what the Senator knows more about Felucia than him. *Hopefully some groups are still down there that we can use to help us get in.*

Jason leaned back into one of the chairs facing the Senator, his face deep in wonder as he started thinking about what they should do next. *Too many unknown variables,* reflected Jason as he stared past the hologram. *But we do need to go in.* Straightening up, Jason leaned forward, pursing his lips as he thought about his next move, and how the others may support this endeaver.
"The lack of intel on this place is a little disconcerting, Senator," Jason said as he stood up from the chair. "But, if this place is as lightly secured as you say it is, then they're not expecting any one to go snooping around." Jason pulled a devious smile as he looked at the others, before putting it away and looking back at the Senator. "I suggest we get medical gear, hiking equipment, and, if possible, a translator unit of the Felucian Language." Jason then bit his lip a little bit before continuing. "I recall that this planet was one of the last places to be fought over during the Clone Wars. What do you want us to do if we find any personel that can be of use there?"

Grates struggled with the conversation going on around him. Hidden behind his mask, his face was contorted in confusion. *Aren't they missing something?* he thought. *We have the Who, the What, Where, and How. But why hasn't anyone asked Why?* A man, reputably honorable, became a turn coat and sold secrets to...to...a senator? *Didn't the military have to answer to the imperial senate, anyhow? Why are there secrets? And why would this senator require those secrets?*
A prison is in the middle of nowhere. He knew of prisons, from first hand experience. Hidden prisons are places you put people you don't want others to know you have as prisioners. Slaves, usually, but political prisoners or folks who would make good martyrs are also popular residents. *And you keep them alive because… because word of their imprisionment won't really get out0 wouldn't want to shame them, right?- but news of their death would. And if you needed to kill them…* Grates flexed his hands into fists, popping all of his knuckles at once. He was disillisiouned. *That's the nice way of saying the turned traitor. No longer a patriot. Was the war too much, or the man too weak? What does it take for an angel to fall?*
*Does this man, this traitor to one cause, deserve to be rescued?* Grates wondered. *Who is this man, this senator, to decide that for him?*  The mercenary leaned where he was, just out of arms reach of Spectre, watching the others leap at the idea of stabbing at the Empire. *Was this Admiral loved? Would the fact he turned his back on every soldier that fought for him hurt the war machine? Would those soldier give up, knowing their leader gave up? Would their cause, their Empire suffer for it?* He mulled over the last part for a moment.
*Their Empire. Not mine.* It was really that simple.
"Extraction," he asked. Getting in was already covered. The doing required on the ground intelligence they didn't have. The getting out... "How we getting him out? You gonna have a ship waiting, or we hoofing on our own ride? Comms. Got anything that speaks spooky*, or just civie junk? Explosives? Need some lock cutters if you ain't got none. Other prisoners? Any of them valuable? This was a old comm 'post, right? If'in they start screamin', how long until back-up shows up? Droids? Battle droids in a closet take up less space than a clone, and are nasty surprises. You said a small garrision, with a point gun. What about heavy weapons? Cannons, repeaters, big boomers, whatever." Grates paused for a breath. "Are we expected to slag and vac the place, or is this just a snatch-n-warp?"

Jason smiled as Grates went into asking about extraction. *Well, we could always walk out the door like we owned the place*, Jason thought as he started mulling over the options. *But that wouldn't go to well if they're half as smart as this group.*
Jason let Grates go on, paying attention to what he was saying and happy that the merc wasn't as dumb as he looked. *Glad I'm wrong about a few of these people*, Jason reflected as he looked over at the three Jedi, noting Ariq's impatience and Art's enthusiasm, but a little concerned about the lack of knowledge or questions from Sajin or the fact that Edwani decided to stay out of the converstion. *However, I will be asking them on thier impressions of this mission and of Senator Organa.

Sajin leans against a wall, his rucksack at his feet. The Nagaian stood stock-still as piece after piece information and question after question filtered over and through him. He listens to and then weighs each one in kind, his thoughts turning carefully.
**"Flesh-eating disease and ferocious wildlife… Sounds like quite the vacation hideaway."**
He knew that the Senator was a good man, the ex-padawan having fought in the Clone wars seemingly so long ago. A lot of good men and women with their hands on the dagger when the curtain fell... The Nagaian smirks to himself but doesn't give further voice to the thought. Instead he kicks his pack up to about chest high and slings it over a shoulder.
**"I've seen my fair share of war Senator, and this very much sounds like the makings of another one."**
With a shrug, he hitches the rucksack until it sits comfortably on his back. Then he folds his arms across his chest.**"…But what must be done will be done, lest we are hunted to extinction, and this Emperor,"** Sajin spits the word, **"Gains a final victory. Honor demands, and the Force wills."**

While Grates is asking his question, the door to the chamber opens, accompanied by a chiming sound and Captain O'Keefe strides in, followed by Sheley Retrac. As Organa glances in their direction, Retrac points at her chronometer. He nods. â€œIâ€™m afraid my shuttle has arrived and I must go now. Fortunately, Captain Okeefe can give you the information you need. Thank you again for your help so far, and Iâ€™ll look forward to our next meeting. May the Force be with you.â€
Sirona speaks as she crosses to the holoprojector, giving the Senator a broad smile as they pass each other, and receiving a warm look in return. â€œGood morning, boys and girls. Let me deal with Mr. Grates' questions."
"The *Banshee* isnâ€™t an assault ship, and the turret will prevent our landing near the prison facility. That means you are going to have to get in and get out with the Admiral on foot...unless you can sabotage the turret system and contact me. During the war, combat units found that communications were very difficult due to natural interference. To contact me, you'll have to tap into the station's comm system. Since this facility was set up as a processing node for Imperial communications across the whole planet, you should have several times the power you'll need to punch through after you've tapped into their transmitters.â€
"A couple of small explosives for lock cutting will be provided, but you should avoid using them unless absolutely necessary, since it's possible you could get in and out without being detected. Be prepared to defeat locks electronically. We can't be sure exactly how long it will take for backup to arrive, but the facility is far from the nearest Imperial forces and it's highly unlikely they'd have alert forces standing around waiting for an assault on a facility so secret."
"As for battle droids, it's no secret that the Empire isn't known for its use of them. Heavy weapons might be present, so be cautious. You won't have any heavy explosives in your kit, so blowing up the facility probably won't be an option. However, if you capture Imperial explosives and you get a chance to take this garrison out, there's probably no reason to hold back. Use your tactical judgment, however, and make sure it's the right move in the current situation."
Turning to the projector, she scrolls the map a bit to the west and zooms it in to a point where you can clearly see surface features. She points to a long and deep canyon that cuts across the ground reasonably close to the prison.
â€œWe can enter here, out of the facilityâ€™s sensor rangeâ€ she says, pointing to the far end of the canyon. Tracing the long canyon around the horizon, she says, â€œThe canyon should hide us from their sensors on our approach. Weâ€™ll put down here, at the closest point to the prison. Iâ€™ll wait there for you to return or call me for pickup.â€
â€œIf you're ready and feel you have the information you need, we'll lift ship within the hour. Any questions?â€

Ariq walkes over to Okefe, trying to not look her in the eye, even though he knows he probably should.

Edwani stands up and streches, with her arms over her head. Apparently the whole briefing was pretty boring for the brash young woman. "Okay. I'll see you guys back at the ship." She offeres with a wave as she leaves the room.
She had the Repulsur Sled waiting outside, loaded with the Correlian Ale that Switch wanted them to deliver once they reached the planet. She didn't know if the rest of the group had forgotten about it or not, but the Arkanian Offshoot wasn't about to forget any chance for some extra credits.

Jason frowned alittle, thinking he should stop her, but decided against it. *Besides, we all get a slice of the profit, unless she thinks that out running a bounty hunter and blaster bolt will be a good idea.*
Clearing his throat and regaining his composure, Jason stood up and folded his hands in front of him. "Thank you, Captain.

Anandi remained silent for the rest of the briefing, absorbing all the information as it was given. At the mention of possibly blowing the whole facility, she perked up. She'd have to make a point of hunting down some explosives while they were there.

Grates stayed behind to continue the discussion with the woman, discussing entrance into the system, landing protocols, and working out a simple code to call for extraction should the crew manage to gain access to the comms tower, but didn't want to broadcast the base had fallen to invaders. He wasn't overly impressed with the Captain, and couldn't help but wonder on how she became such a trusted member of...*I can't believe we're doing a job for a* senator. Still, the woman was his ride into chaos and blaster fire. He would deal with whatever scars she brings about before that.
Once the basics were taken care of- a short talk, as he often planned very loosely and didn't need much information for that- he nodded curtly, and walked into town. He wandered aimlessly for a few hours, feeling out the city, until he was used to the sights and sounds. Access to a local computer network let him find the shops he needed. He moved from shop to shop in a brisk manner, asking the store keepers the price. When he was done, he inventoried his supplies, pleased he found most what he was looking for. A bundle of straps, belts and buckles for a new combat harness, two slings for each rifle and carbine, a new short range comm unit, a pair of holsters, several rolls of mesh tape, and several more odds and ends, a few he grabbed because they looked interesting and nothing more. Happy with his new treasure, he headed back to the ship.
He was almost all the way out when he saw it. It was nestled in the back of the shop, completely hidden from the street, unless you were at the exact right position. Passing under the sign that read 'Industrial Answers', the scarred man passed by stacks of power tools, from shock hammers to forge wrenches, interlock wedges and duro fusiers. He had to walk around a heavy maintenance droid- pausing to admire the arc welders it had for hands- before reaching his target. Gripping the black handles with both hands, Grates grunted as he hefted the bulky device. It was heavy, unwieldy, and ugly. When the clerk walked up to the mercenary, Grates simply asked "How much?"

After haggling with the clerk, Grates manages to talk him down to 2,000 credits, though the man mutters about losing his shirt and leaving no inheritance for his children. When he returns to the palace, the guards delay him a good five minutes looking over the thing and making absolutely sure it's useless as a weapon.
Sheltay informs the rest of you that she can arrange to deliver any equipment you need to the *Banshee.* That way they can limit your visibility on the planet. She can get practically anything that's not a weapon or too heavily restricted. She and the Captain escort you to the ship.
As you board The Banshee, you see a courier droid hovering near the entrance ramp, holding the crate of ale. Itâ€™s head swivels to track as you approach and its eyes flash. A small arm unfolds out of its torso toward you, holding out a credstick to Jason.
((An hour later...))
You are all strapped in aboard the Banshee. Everyone is quiet, looking inward. Though there was fighting before at Sel Zonn station, this feels very different. For those of you who fought in the Cone Wars or other conflicts around the galaxy, this is just like old times, getting a target briefing and then soaring off into combat.
A voice comes through the cockpit comm panel: â€œBanshee, you are cleared for takeoff. Follow departure corridor Aurek to its end before climbing to orbit. Fair winds and a good flight.â€
â€œAcknowledged, tower. Thank you, and good day.â€ Sirona and Crash raise the Banshee on her repulsorlifts, expertly soaring away from the palace and, following an air corridor assigned to her by the control tower, out over the gorgeous valley that holds Aldera. By now it's almost noon, and the metal-cased buildings glint like jewels spread on deep green velvet. If you close your eyes you can almost imagine you're right back in an LAAT or other combat transport, headed into enemy territory to fight the Republic--or fight for it. Only this time the Republic is gone, its mere corruption twisted into something even more evil, something that must be killed.
Sirona gently raises the Banshee's nose to point into the depths of the perfect blue sky, and you're soon streaking upward into orbit. It's not long before you're back in space, free to unstrap from your seats and go about your business.
((Add any items you wish to purchase to your equipment lists. No weapons, no stuff classified as "military" in the availability slot. Keep in mind that you can pile on as much as an extra 2,000 credits from the Senator's payment.
Make one role-playing post if you wish during the journey to Felucia. When I post tomorrow you'll be arriving there. thanks for your patience.))

Jason nodded at the Captain, quickly deciding what is probably is needed and decided that the 2000 from willl go to getting gear they could use. *Like medpacs*, Jason thought as he started up his laptop and plugged into the local net, calling up a medical andf survival catalogue, writing down what he thinks should be brought. Staring at the screen, Jason bit his lip as he started analyzing the various gear that is available. *Let's see. Better get a Medical Kit since this is a hostile environment. We may not be there long, but I would rather be safe and cautious than dead. Additional medpacs will do, too, since we won't have too much in the way of support. *Pressing on a link, Jason noticed various scanners, picking two different ones. *This way we won't have to worry about things sneaking up. Good the medical kit has repulsorlift stretcher, it would suck carrying the gear.*
Almost done, Jason started browsing around when he noticed a new item on the screen. Curious, Jason clicked on the item, impressed by what the manufacturer and developer promised, but even more impressed when the item had listed the various hospitals, emergency crews, and paramilitary groups had said about the product, as well as a alist of the groups that use it. *Well, I'll just trade out mine, then, for one of these babies*, Jason thought as he put one on the list and took off one of the medpacs. *After all, it would suck if the medic goes down when you need him the most.*
Satisfied, Jason took one last look at the list, noted it went over a little bit but satisfied it was to save people's lives as much his own when he handed the item off to Sheltay, thanking her.
The list:
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

MDS-50 Medisensor 75 creds 0.1 kg
Heat Sensor 250 creds 0.2 kg
FastFlesh Medpac 600 creds 0.5 kg
Medical Kit 600 creds 20 kg
5 Medpacs 500 creds 5kg
Total 2025 Credits

</details>

******
As the group approached the *Banshee* Jason noticed the droid holding out a cred stick out, carrying the crate of ale. *Hope the customer won't get too pissed off when he discovers one less bottle*, Jason reflected as he waited for his equipment to arrive, taking the box and climbing board. Once he secured the box, Jason strapped himself in and waited for the greenlight to unstrap himself and started going through the kits, replacing his medpac with the FastFlesh Medpac before putting the six medpacs into the medical kit, and pulling out the repulsorlift strecther and uncollapsing it. After that, Jason checked on the two sensors, the medisensor and the heat sensor, making sure they work, before securing the gear and going to the kitchen to start on dinner.**

Ariq had been looking over the list of available materials. He knew what he was looking for, just wasn't sure he'd find it here. But, maybe he could. After all, the weapons weren't normal weapons. They could be used in sporting arenas. It just depended on whether or not they had these sports on Alderaan.

Artreth needed nothing other than what he already carried with him, so he boarded their ship as soon as they were dismissed. He spent the entirety of the trip either in his room meditating or at a viewport, watching the stars fly by.

((Sorry for the delay. Couldn't get on the net this morning, which would have been OK if I hadn't had a time window less than a half an hour long before I headed out to camp. I'm done with camp until next year so I'll be back to morning and evening posts where appropriate.))
Crash plots a course that mostly follows the Perlemian trade route, which makes the long journey to the outer rim much faster, but it is still a long journey. Though the quarters are tight, the beautiful ship is appointed like a spa, and you enjoy the few days of much needed relaxation and rest.
On approach to Felucia, Sirona tells everyone to strap in at battlestations, as a precautionary measure. The proximity alert sounds and the ship jumps out of lightspeed. Felucia fills your viewscreen. You are on the night side of the planet, but you can see the terminator. The atmosphere seems covered in iridescent haze, making it hard to distinguish the sea from the land, and there arenâ€™t many lights.
Sirona flips a few switches to mask the transponder. Then she cuts her engines, and doesnâ€™t start them again until the ship is already caught in the gravity well. The *Banshee* descends, punching through clouds and rain until you suddenly break through the overcast.
â€œThere,â€ Crash calls out. â€œI have the canyon on our right side.â€ You look where he's pointing and you can see it amid the lush and brightly colored vegetation. It swings to the center of the cockpit viewport as Sirona heads for it, and you feel a squeeze of deceleration and feel your stomach drop as she dips beneath the walls and pushes the ship down the slot. â€œHang on! This could get tight, really fast!â€
Taking her time, the *Banshee* pushes through a bizarre landscape of giant flowers, tendrils and bloated fungi. The vegetation makes the canyon much tighter than it appeared on the map, and sometimes the orange tinted overcast sky disappears in the tunnel. Strange flying creatures are bumping and splatting against the windscreen in the rain. Rounding a corner, the slot opens wider, and Sirona accelerates down the straightaway, gliding easily over a cluster of orange mushrooms larger than the ship.
â€œWeâ€™ll set down over thereâ€, she says, pointing to a ledge.
Just as she says that, one of the massive mushrooms balloons up to twice its size and rockets upwards, trailing a cluster of tendrils underneath it. â€œWhat theâ€¦?â€ Sirona jukes the ship to the right, but itâ€™s too tight. The gasbag explodes, buffeting the ship with orange dust and slime. You feel a lurch and a sickening dip as the repulsors begin to give out.
â€œBrace!â€
Sirona fires the engines hard and the ship plunges forward. She points the nose clumsily at a soft and large shelf mushroom near the lip of the canyon and fires the engine hard again. The Banshee arcs upward, and at the top of the arc it slides it to a lurching stop on the fungus. The viewport is blocked by transluscent membraneous flowers.
"Well, that was close," Sirone breatehs. "I think you'd better get your gear; it doesn't look like we're going anywhere right away.
A while later, after gearing up, you step down into the shelf fungus, and sink a little in squishy biomass. The air smells fertile and you can see fragrant wafts of pollens streaming from bulging stamens. The landscape seems even more bizarre at ground level. The membranous vegetation is translucent, oversized, and coloured brightly. It is hot and humid, and insects fly and crawl everywhere.
Sirona appears at the hatch. â€œThe damage isnâ€™t bad. The repulsors failed because their heat exchangers became clogged with pollen. We'll need to clean it out before we can fly again, and I need to get the carcass off the ship." You follow her pointing finger and see the remains of the gasbag draped across the ship like a balloon. It's the same bright orange as the high visibility flight suits some starfighter pilots wear, which, in this place, is perfect camouflage.
â€œWe have enough portable supplies here for a weekâ€™s travel, but you shouldnâ€™t be gone that long. It shouldnâ€™t take you more than a day or so to get there, but I can wait here for your communiquÃ© for a week if I have to. Crash will monitor the comm channels 24 hours a day for your message, so it wonâ€™t be missed. Your datapads have been uploaded with maps showing the location of the facility. Be careful out there. Come back to me guys. Iâ€™ll keep the tub warm.â€

Ariq steps out onto the foreign soil, feeling the Living Force all around him in the insects and fungi that permeate the area. He looks down at his feet and sees several of them beginning to crawl over his boots, but they get shaken off almost immediately as Ariq starts walking in the direction that Okeefe pointed.
Turning around towards the group, Ariq realized that he wasn't carrying a whole lot of gear, and felt that he should help out somehow.
"Um, does anyone want me to carry anything for them?"
(Silverback, did I get the two sets of gloves? If so, can anyone help me put them together, say like during the trip to Felucia, so that they're together now?)

Once the ship stopped moving, Jason looked at Captain Okeefe. "Well, Captain, any landing we can walk away from is a good landing," Jason with a chuckle as he undid his seat's restraints and walked back. *Hope that's it for the excitement, otherwise we might be screwed,* Jason reflected as he pulled out his datapad and a data card that had the map of the place, nodding when Captain Okeefe mentioned how long the trip would be and how long she was going to stay onstation. *That is if we don't run into trouble.*
Quickly, Jason unstrapped the medical kit and stretcher, grabbing his bag, and, carfully, made his way down the ramp. *Oi*, was all Jason thought as he looked around at the giant fungi, his expression a look of wonder. *Wow, this place is definetely alive.*
Shaking his head, Jason pulled out both scanners, double checking the heat sensor to make sure there wasn't any interference. *This will definetely help at night.* Silently, Jason took the repulsorlift stretcher down on the ground, put the medical kit and his bag on it, and strapped them both securely to the the stretcher when Ariq asked if any one needed help. Looking up, Jason tilted his head towards the stretcher.
"Thanks Ariq," Jason said as he double checked the straps. "I don't want to find out that we needed a medkit if we run into anything. By the way, which end do you want," Jason asked as he pointed to the stretcher.

Jason nodded as walked over to the stretcher. "The repulsorlift stratchers do, but it only allows them to hover maybe a half foot off the ground. But the good nes is that we're not carrying anything too heavy, so it shouldn't be that big a pain in the rear."
OOC: To bad they don't have repulsorlift stretchers in real life. Those would have come in handy for those field ops.

Anandi stuck her new security kit on her belt and followed the others off the ship. She gazed around at the fungi and the flowers, but the only thing she could think was, *I'm actually here.*
Anandi strode across the spongy ground, not looking to see where anyone else was. She wandered away, and looked around in amazement at the planet. She never thought it could look like this.
Taking a deep breath to get her mind back on the mission, she returned to the group. "Well, let's get going already."

The ground [i[squished under Grate;s boot as he first stepped off the ramp, and he grimanced behind his mask. The hours he spent caring for his boots were undone with his first moment on the planet. Depression and lethargy beckoned, and he beat them back with his tedious grip on anticipation. Soon, there would be the stink of burned air, flesh, and plant life mixed with the sizzle of energy bolts and purifying agony of injuries. In that, he would forget.
A spring had shown up in his step when his boots left Alderaan and climbed aboard the *Banshee*. The plasma cutting was an immense weight on his shoulder, and his happy steps sounded like thunder on the decking. But he had new clothes, holster, and a bag of fried bird meat for two in hand, and looking forward to sharing it. Les than a minute later he was staring at the message on the console, not seeing the message Spectre had left, his good mood disappearing like space dust into the void.
He left the room after the ship had taken off, ignoring everything around him. Hours were spent in the cargo bay, brutalizing what few crates that decorated the hold, and then to the walls when the crates began to show signs of damage. He fell back into his mercenary training, mixing hand to hand combat with blade work and blaster shots (set to stun, to avoid damage to the ship), powering his way through hundreds of imaginary foes. His katas lacked the grace of the Jedi, focused instead on brutal efficiency and crippling simplicity. He would return to the room only to shower, collapsing to slept in the common area when his was too tired to continue. Food was taken in passing, consumed but not enjoyed.
He ignored anyone and everyone. His behavior toward the others was that of some one who happened to traveling in the same direction, and nothing more. When the ship finally- and dramatically- landed, he was already prepared to leave. He didn't care about the mission so much as it was a task to be completed, a way for him to act without thought, to engage in battle, to throw himself at the univesre once more, daring the galaxy to attempt once more it had failed to do so many times before.
Gritting his teeth, he shrugged his shoulders, shifting the weight of his weapons and gear- including the blaster carbine Spectre had left him- and set on in the direction of the facility. The universe had taken something from him, and he would have a short conversation with the representatives of the universe on what he thought of that.

You trek through the humid jungle for hours, insects skittering across your boots on a regular basis. Most of the time you're surrounded by a thick haze of pollen that limits visibility to a couple of dozen meters. The jungle smells of a strange mix of perfume and decay, and is filled with the sounds of life. Insects buzz and hum, birdlike creatures call and whistle, far-off screams from something that sounds quite large echo of the walls of the valley that descends from the canyon. Sometimes you are making your way down narrow trails blazed by some local animal; other times you are fighting your way through masses of plants and fungi, struggling just to keep traveling on the correct compass heading. Anandi leads, followed by Artreth, Ariq and Jason with the stretcher, Sajin and Grates.
Insects harass you, sweat runs off you, your clothes cling to you and danger dogs you. When Ariq and Jason step in a large puddle that Anandi and Artreth leaped over, they find it's full of acid, not water. It leaves parts of their clothing holed and burns their legs. Jason manages to treat the burns with his medical kit but they remain painful. About two hours later you're passing through an area that is clear of the giant flowers and fungi, but is filled with waist-high mushrooms about a meter and a half in diameter. As Sajin and Grates pass by a pair of them, they burst outward violently. Long, barbed spines jab outward and tendrils with razor-sharp edges grasp at the two men. Both are cut by tendrils, and Sajin is stabbed in the right leg and arm by two of the spines. The lacerations from the tendrils are easy to close as wounds go, but Jason finds the damage from the spines to be far more difficult to cure. Even though he removes the spines carefully, Sajin is limping as you move on toward your goal.
Soon you have been away from the ship for a little over six hours. You began around midmorning local time, and now the sun is low in the sky, but still more of a smudge than a sun because of the haze. You emerge from the jungle into a swampy open area with small islands of solid ground interspersed throughout a shallow pool of water. The cacophony of noise created by insects and animals makes it nearly impossible to hear the splash of your footsteps as you move into the lagoon. There are flowers and broad, room-sized leaves under the water, with colossal fungi and massive flowers poking through. A faint mist hangs over the area, drifting over the still pool of water. By now, the crazy colours and weird sunlight are tiring your eyes, but you see something unusual in the distance – something stark and white that appears to floating in the water next to a large fungus.
((All the damage Ariq, Jason and Grates took was cured by First Aid. Sajin suffered 12 points of damage--the mushroom rolled a 20--and Jason was able to cure 4.))

"Well, at least I didn't set off the barbed fungus. Sajin, you look pretty bad. Guys, why don't we make camp for the night. That might give Sajin a chance to finish healing up."
As he set his end of the stretcher down to emphasize his point, he looked in the direction that Artreth was pointing.
"Good question. I don't like things I can't see. Not on principle."
Absently minded flexing his fists in his gloves, Ariq reaches out with the Force and his other senses, trying to figure out just exactly what that was.

Jason helps Ariq lower the stretcher. sweat soaking through his clothes. *Crap, this place is a frakking sauna*, Jason thought as he stood up, leaning backwards to stretch out his back. *Except this place can kill you.* Jason then looked down at his legs, noticing the bandages and salve are working on the burns.
When Ariq asked about camping for the night, Jason looked over at him, looked up at the sky, then back Ariq. "I don't think that would be a good idea, Ariq," Jason said as he started rummaging through the medkit, pulling out the heat scanner. "But I don't mind resting for an hour or so." Carefully readjusting the sensor, Jason did sweep of the area ahile everyone used their eyes to see if anything was out of the ordinary. *I wonder what medical properties are in some of these plants and fungi.

The heat on the trek didn't bother Anandi much--she was Iktotchi after all--but the humidity as killing her. She liked her air dry and breathable, some said stuffy. But this was near unbearable, and it was starting to make her irritable.
Her voice came out at nearly a growl. "It's not natural," Anandi said of the white object in the distance. "Nothing here looks like that. It could be Imperial. Jason's right, we don't want to camp here. If that is an Imp station, that would be a very bad idea."

Grates looked at the distant object, utterly bored, and scowled at it. He didn't own any marco-binoculars- his last set stop a blaster bolt and had som,e of it's remains still embedded in his side- so he couldn't make out anything about the unnatural looking object. *"It's not natural"*, Anandi had said. *Like she has any idea what natural looks on this planet*, he growled silently. His arms and neck stung from the barbed tendrils from the giant flower, and sweat poured into those new rents in his skin, pooling under the bandages and stinging.
He was happy he chose to leave his newly repaired armor behind- an act done more to lose the remains of the memories than for any other reason- as he would have been sweating much worse with it's weight. Not that he wasn't over loaded as it was. The industrial plasma cutter pulled painfully down on his shoulder strap, and was braced on his back by two blaster carbines. His rifle stayed his hands, but the blaster pistols were strapped on each hip. With any luck, the blaster packs for each would last the battle, and he wouldn't resort to the vibro-blade in his boot.
Annoyed- he hadn't shot anything and the twice-curse pant had hardly done any damage- he swatted an over-sized beetle he mistook for a biting insect. He took a moment to find the most concealed route to the strange object, and pointed it out to the rest. He wanted blaster fire to burn at plants and stench around him, and soon. Camping would slow them down.
"Those plants deal so much damage for a reason. We don't want to meet whatever eats flowers that need spikes to defend themselves," Grates said, wondering why his voice sounded so harsh. He realized then that he hadn't said anything since he purchased the plasma cutter, several days ago. He shrugged. He really didn't need to talk.

((I'll be running Sajin until Anazider shows up. See the OCC thread for more info.))
In answer to Ariq's sugestion, Sajin shakes his head. He is in pain, but his desire to be gone from this place is stronger than the discomfort from his wounds.
As the others discuss the white object, Jason calibrates his heat sensor. He doesn't see any heat sources other than a bird or two; even the white object is at roughly the same temperature as the atmosphere. As he looks away from the sensor, he does see something strange. He sees what appears to be a tendril-covered head underwater at the edge of one of the huge leaves. It is emerging from under the leaf, and as he looks at the head he notices that there is also an arm, well muscled and multi-colored, with a weapon in its hand.
Before he can point this out to the others, six humanoid forms (including the one Jason was looking at) explode from the water in a rough semicircle in front of you. Tall and muscular, these beings seem to be members of the native Felucian species. The long, slender form of a rancorâ€™s jawbone juts from each Felucianâ€™s hand, and each wears a leafy loincloth. Streaks of color cross their bodies, but at a glance you're not sure if it's natural coloring or some sort of tattooing or paint. Tangles of tendrils around their faces make it impossible to see their eyes, but they clearly have violence on their mind judging by their aggressive movements.

Finishing calibrating the heat sensor, Jason was mildly annoyed yet pleased that the heat sensor was picking up only the birds and other warmblooded creatures. *That's good, I guess,* he thought as he looked up from it. *At least the white object isn't…*
*Real?* Jason thought as noticed something moving from under one of the leaves. Tilting his head to the right a little, Jason squinted when the alien leaped from the water. "FRAK!" Jason immediately reached for his blaster with his right hand, almost letting go of the heat sensor. "Contact!" Jason yelled as he pulled his heavy blaster out, letting off a shot at the closest Felucian.

*Ah, the natives,* Grates mused, looking at the truly ugly beasts that erupted out of the swamp. He had forgotten about them. His mood meant he would love to shoot them all, right then and there, but there were multiple Jedi-wish-they-were's in the crew, and he didn't want to waste time arguing with them about leaving large smoking holes in these monstrosities. *They'll want to 'talk' to these things, I guess,* he scowled under his mask.
Just as that thought finished, Grates heard Jason's land cannon bark. *Hm. Well. Tark.*
((Stand there and be annoyed, i.e. holding action until he gets a grasp on what everyo9ne else is doing. Since he goes first, anyhow, I'll just wait until next round to do anything))

Jason's blaster barks and a bright red bolt slams into the chest of the nearest native. He is killed instantly and falls backward with a splash.
The remaining natives each make a thrusting gesture with their empty hand, a motion that reminds Ariq of open hand strikes he learned from his master. Air, water, earth and rotting swamp debris come together to form bubbling globules in front of them, then the globules surge out from them, heading for the remaining members of your party. Artreth, Ariq and Grates are each struck by this mess, while Sajin is able to duck and Anandi sidsteps, watching the globule fly past before turning back to the native that targetted her.
((Damages are the following:
Artreth: 3 points
Ariq: 8

Anandi stumbled backwards as the Felucians leapt from the water. Immediately, she recognized them from the CIS files. She smacked into the stump of a flower and lost her breath for a second. When she regained it, she drew her blaster. With a growl, she switched on her rapid recycler and unleashed her fury on the Felucians.

Ow, the mercenary thinks, and snaps his rifle up. Ow, ow, ow, ow. Plans and thoughts anyone's desire left his mind immediately. The glob had landed- and burned through- one of the bandages on his shoulder. The stinging sweat was evaporated by the shearing projectile, and Grates knew he had just lost the impressive looking cross-hatchet scars the plant had left, now replaced by a acid burn. And he had enough acid burns.
As soon as the rifle barrel lined up with the closest creature's...was that a head? the mercenary depressed the trigger.

The body of the Felucian that Jason burned a hole through barely sunk into the water before Jason switched targets, finish aiming at one of the Felucian's buddies before letting off another shot. *Better get out of here and over to the others.* Jason barely finished the thought as he turned on his heel, moving around the stretcher as he slogged through the water and mud.

A stream of bolts flies out of Anandi's pistol, striking the two Felucians on the west end of their line. They both are hit, but are still up and fighting.
Grates cuts down his target with two quick shots. As the Felucian falls he sees that he's left a ragged hole where the creature's face was.
Jason aims carefully at the closest Felucian--the one that shot the globule of debris at Ariq--and fires a bolt that slams into the creature's ribs and drops him. He splashes through mud as he runs around the back of the stretcher toward Ariq.
Though they're heavily outnumbered, the remaining Felucians throw up a bloodcurdling howl and charge. The two that Anandi shot head for her, and both connect, but it's difficult for them to both attack at the same time and they don't do as much damage as they could. The third catches Grates across the chest with a painful, but not quite lethal strike.
((Anandi takes 8 points of damage, Grates takes 6. We're now partway through round one; MoDaVader, Zenkatarn and Anazider can post and I'll finish up the round.))

A pained grunt escaped Anandi's lips as she was attacked. She stumbled backward, away from them, simultaneously letting loose another volley of rapid laserfire. "Yeah, that's right," she taunted. "I'll show you what happens to people who attack me," she taunted. She continued to pepper them with blaster shots, not about to relent and give them the advantage.

Anandi nimbly moves back out of the reach of the Felucians. They are running forward to strike her again when she cuts them down with another burst of pistol fire. Each takes multiple bolts in the chest and abdomen and they fall in the mud, certainly dead.
Sajin draws and ignites his lightsaber, and swings its white blade in a mighty downward strike at the head of the Felucian who had attacked Grates. The native reacts in time (just barely) and raises his skullblade to stop the saber just a few centimeters from his forehead. Sajin is shocked, but keeps his head, struggling with the native for advantage.
Just then, a man’s voice echoes through the swampy area. “Peace! Please, stop fighting!” A middle aged man with a scarred face and long stringy gray hair gallops in on a kybuck. He is unarmed. "Stop, please! This is a misunderstanding, we should be allies," he adds, a worried expression on his face.

Jason barely made it over to Ariq when the shouting reached him, causing him to turn to the man that was running towards them. *Finally, a local who can speak our language,* Jason, looking over at the struggling Sajin. Taking a deep breath, Jason motioned for everyone to hold fire, then looked over at the approaching man. "Sir, if you would kindly called off your associate, we would gladly talk to you," Jason said he switched his blaster to stun, his expression going serious. *Just in case.*
"Serious guys, go to stun if you can. Don't have to kill everyone if we can prevent it."

((I'm posting this without waiting because it makes story sense. Everyone can feel free to post after this.))
The man dismounts. He doesn't seem bothered at all by the swamp as he splashes toward you through foul water that's knee deep. Looking around at the bodies of the five native warriors, he sighs sadly. The remaining native seems to be trying to watch Sajin and Grates and the gray-haired man all at the same time. The man speaks a few words to him in a guttural language and he lowers his weapon to waist level. They exchange a few more sentences, and you can see the human becoming more weighed down by regret as they speak.
"These are some of the younger warriors from the village," the human says to you. "They thought you were Imperials. They didn't know any better."
He seems lost in thought for a moment, then he turns back to his kybuck, and the native glances at you all one more time and follows him. When the human reaches the kybuck he takes its reins in his hand and beckons you to follow. "I doubt you want to stay out in the open tonight. The village will shelter you, and we have food we can share. There's nothing to fear...they won't hold this incident against you. I can explain what happened and this one"--he indicates the survivng warrior--can help."
"We'd better go...it will be dark soon." He begins leading the kybuck north through the shallow water.

His body still stinging from where the primate had burned him, Grates wasn't feeling very forgiving-and-forgetting. While his posture remained stiff, the but of his rifle was fast to his shoulder and the still smoking barrel tracked the creature. The arrival of the human didn't phase the mercenary; his arrival just as the victors became apparent was just too coincidental. But the blaster remained silent; he lay waste to teh remaining monster, his civilized master, and the pack beast, without a obvious threat or the go-ahead of the rest of his crew.
Murder for money was how Grate earned his money before this little side quest, and murder in preemptive self-defense wouldn't bother in in the slightest.
A sudden thought entered his mind, and his grim smile pressed on the inside of his mask; had Spectre been there, all of the primates would have been dead, and so would this human.

Anandi watched the newcomer warily, and held her pistol up. She wasn't going to be like Jason and switch her blaster off its kill setting just because some guy walked up and talked nice to them. She was also smart enough not to say so aloud.
As the man left with his kybuck, Anandi stayed put. "I don't think we should go anywhere. A handful of his warriors just jumped up and attacked us. I don't think the smartest thing we could do is to follow him."

Jason looked between the man riding away on his kybuck and his companions, switching from stun to safe, then going back to kill. *Could be a trap*, he thought as he looked over at Grates, Anandi, and the Jedi, taking stock of their wounds. *Then again, if they wanted us dead, why don't they just send out like twenty of these warriors and end it here, instead of using a scouting party.*
Jason looked over at Ariq, noting that the Jedi have to Force to call on if the going gets tough.
"Hey Ariq, what does your instincts say?"
Jasan waits on what Ariq says.
-----*****-----
Ariq looked down at the still bodies of the Felucian warriors, noting that the last one still alive, before Jason's question got through him. *Never thought I'd see some many people go down in such a short time*, was all Ariq thought as he slowed down his breath, closing his eyes and reaching out with the Force.

*"Hey Ariq, what does your instincts say?"* Jason had asked. Grates mulled over that, see what he felt about the stranger. The mercenary didn't trust anything when the universe just dropped something on them, so he didn't trust this guy. He didn't trust the rest of the group- Specter was the closest thing he had with trust, and look what *she* did- but they were devils he knew. He had no reason to believe this man had anything to offer but pain and suffering.
Pain and suffering.
Grates dropped his rifle down, and reloaded the power pack. Shouldering the weapon he trudged his way beyond the primates and toward the new comer. Be it pain, suffering, death, blaster fight or brawl, I'm in, he thought. Grates knew this new creature was going to lead him somewhere where battle would be. That was the whole point of showing up near Grates. It's who the universe worked. At it was rude to keep the universe waiting.

The man stops, turns and listens as Anandi, Jason and Ariq discuss his offer. As he sees Grates lower his weapon and move forward, a momentary expression moves across his face. It's as if he's recognizing something, but there's something else there...pain or sadness perhaps, or the expression the wise get when they arrive at a conclusion. But whatever it is, it's gone before you can be sure, and he turns his head to speak to the rest of the group.
"The lady's being smart, but the man has a point: If we wanted to wipe you out, we wouldn't have started with six men. Besides, we could hardly be more trouble than an acklay or a rancor."
As the man is speaking, Ariq searches his feelings. Concentrating, he becomes sure that following him is a good decision.
The stranger goes back to leading his kybuck through the shallows, and he continues talking, seeming to assume that Grates isn't the only one who will follow. The sound of his deep voice carries surprisingly well.
“My name is Mandrake, Vazus Mandrake. I was stranded here on Felucia during the Clone Wars after my mercenary unit was wiped out by clone troopers. It’s where I got this," he says, pointing to the wide scar on his face. "I managed to crawl off into the jungle, and they didn’t hunt me down. The war ended, and with the help of the Felucians, I nursed myself back to health. Now I make my home with them and they treat me like a member of the tribe. I tend a small herd of kybuck, it’s one of only a few things I have left from home on Corulag."
Tell me, what are your intentions here on Felucia?"

Jason looked over at Mandrake, nodded, then looked back at Anandi. "See? Besides, he might be able to help us."
With that said, Jason walked over to one end of the stretcher, double checking that everything was good and in working order, and put the heat sensor away.
*****=====*****
Ariq opened his, the Force being clear on what is going on. "I'd say we go ahead and trust the mercenary," Ariq said as he walked over to the other end of the stretcher. "Ready, Jason? On three. One, two three."
Lifting the stretcher, Jason and Ariq followed Grates and Vazus Mandrake.

Sajin stood alone, off to the side, contemplating the will of the Force. He must have arrived at the same conclusion Ariq had, because he wasted no time in following Mandrake and his kybuck.
He was quiet, letting the others talk among themselves. He already knew his path: the Force had laid it out before him. Anandi was reluctant to do anything the easy way, as always, and if that is the way she wanted to be, he wouldn't stop her.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anandi most certainly did *not* want to follow the man, no matter how much her allies insisted. Still, she knew better than to brave the Felucian wilderness alone, so she followed behind, grumbling at Jason's statement. Her instincts told her this was a very bad idea but what choice did she have?
And then Mandrake went and flipped everything she though she knew around: "My mercenary unit was wiped out by clone troopers." *His* mercenary group, wiped out by clones.
"You worked with the Separatists?"

((Sorry for the gap. Been sick as a dog for a couple of days.))
"Yes," Mandrake says, "my unit was on the Separatist side. I'd been in the regiment for years by the time the Clone Wars began and the unit had become like a family to me. We were one of the biggest and best merc outfits in the galaxy, and I'd worked my way up to platoon sergeant. We fought in a number of the Outer Rim sieges, but this place was by far the worst. I heard the Separatist commanders actually dared the Republic to come and take Felucia from them, though that might have been just scuttlebutt. In any event, the Republic sent the 182nd Legion to capture the planet, and even though they had total space superiority and bombarded the hell out of us, they were slaughtered. They probably sustained something like 95% casualties, it was like the terrain was working with us; it swallowed them up, drove them to distraction, fed them into our blaster sights. We made Felucia their graveyard."
"We didn't have long to celebrate, though. They sent in the 501st Legion, and they made Felucia our graveyard. They dropped two regiments into my regiment's battle area, but the way they carved us up, it might as well have been a dozen. They overran us and..." He looks at the ground for a moment, fighting a grimace of pain. "...As I crawled away--to die, I thought--half blind and with a bad belly wound, I could hear the comm calls begging for help as the support & HQ battalion got massacred. But none of us were left to go help, and the droid units on our flanks were scrap metal. Out of 3,500 men, I may be the only one left alive."
"But that's the past," he says with a slight smile. "For the present, we should get you some food and shelter."
As you've been listening to him, you've walked into the village sanctuary of about two dozen Felucian families. The village appears to have been carved from the massive mushrooms that dominate the landscape. Each one looks old and petrified, or perhaps treated with a curing agent, making them appear more solid than their still-living counterparts surrounding them in the jungle.
In the center of the village, a number of brightly striped native felucians gather in a half circle, squatting by a cooking fire and turning to look at you as you enter. Though the village has been cleared, small mushrooms and other plants still rise up through the spongy ground. Some of the village younglings approach you, touching your pants or robes curiously, feeling the fabric and smelling you. After a moment a female quickly gathers the children and brings them back to the fire as Mandrake chuckles.
One of the mushroom dwellings is especially squat, with a space between the cap and the stalk. You see the curious faces of a small herd of kybuck staring back at you from the mushroom corral.

Jason slightly grimaced when Mandrake mentioned his allegiance to the Seperatists. *To think I almost gotten fried for some one turning technical plans over to them.* Looking around the village, Jason's mind quickly moved forward. *I may not know the exact science, but this place could definetely be useful for medical practices.* Jason cleared his throat as he and Ariq took stretcher over to the hut with the coral. "I take it the Felucians healed you, correct," questioned Jason as he and Ariq put the stretcher down near the hut.
Stretching his shoulder a bit, Jason looked around, taking stock of the place. "As to why we are here, it has something to do with the Imperials that your warriors thought we were." *Maybe Senator Organa might want to recruit some of the locals?*

Anandi felt much more confident in following Mandrake after learning he was a former Separatist. "I trained with the Separatists, but never saw a battlefield. The war ended first. My father was trying to pull strings to avoid me getting posted here. I cans see why, now."
As they entered the camp and some of the native children approached her, she tried to brush them away with a grimace. It wasn't that she didn't like children, but she had no idea how to ac around them. They were so fragile and yet they were so hardy at the same time. No, it was better just not to get involved with them.
-------------------------------------------
Saijin, however, engaged the children as they came up to them. He spoke in a quiet voice so only the children could hear what he had to say, and part of his was disappointed when their mothers pulled them back.
He gazes around with a careful, trained eye, instinctively looking for any dangers. He knew that the Felucians wouldn't camp here if it wasn't safe, but he trusted himsefl far more than he trusted them.

Ariq could barely suppress the grin on his face when Sajin was talking to the children, not even bothering to eavesdrop since it was cool that th ol' stick in the mud was showing more of a spontaneous side, but went back to helping Jason continue to carry the stretcher. *This is why we do what we do,* he thought to himself as the mothers came by and gathered up the children. *So that people, of all races, don't have to worry about getting killed by some tyrant.*
When the group made it to the hut next to the kybuk herd, Ariq helped lower the repulsorlift stretcher, standing back up and stretching out, letting his feelings reach out to get a sense of the area.

Grates sighed, and stretched, feeling his wounds begin their healing process. Crouching down, he followed his normal pattern and ignored the others until something interesting happened.
Looking down at his boots, he scowled his displeasure at the terrible shape they were in. He might have to pay some one to repair them. Looking up, he glared at the rest of the crew; they seemed to be mirroring his action and ignoring him in return. Out of place, he thought as he dug out one of the flavorless ration packs he had taken from the ship. Always out of place. As he lifted his mask to take a bite of the stale nutrition bar, he thought back to his own days in the Separatist military. He was out of place there; an jaded mercenary among idealist and thugs. He was out of place in the mines. He was out of place at home. He struggled to think of a place he felt right in.
Well, he grinned, Specter's room had been nice. He quickly pushed the thought of her away, before he sank back into depression. He never liked loss. Annoyed at his own weaknesses, Grates pulled his rifle to his shoulder and sighted the wood-line, idly wondering if a Rancor or something would pop into view, perhaps just by him wishing for it.

With that in mind, Jason stepped forward, smiling his best as he opened his arms and spread out his fingers in what he hoped would come off as nonthreatening. "Your honor, my colleagues and I are here *for* the Imperials. If you can, we would like some assistance in *finding* them."

The chief gazes at you each in turn before answering. His gaze lingers much longer on Sajin, Ariq and Artreth than on the rest of you, and the three Jedi hear guttural whispers in their minds as he looks them over. Finally, he speaks, first nodding to Sajin.
"I can see that you all walk different paths, though three of you have walked through one place before you walked this path."
Turning to Jason he says, "Why do you seek these Imperials? To assist them? Join them? Take from them? Destroy them?"
Ariq reaches out with the Force, and senses...something that is not right, but it slips away before he can be sure what it is. He's left with an impression of someone weeping.

Jason smiled, trying to figure out which words to use next, grateful that Mandrake was there to translate. *I don't want to give them false hope, but they do need to know the truth, at least on the surface.* Jason pursed his lips, then cleared his throat.
"If you're asking if we are here to destroy the Imperials, I'm sorry that we cannot take them all out," Jason said, letting genuine concern through. "We are here because friend of ours has been taken from us and we believe the Imperials have him. An unwilling guest, if you will."
Hoping that would appease the chief, at least until he knew more about him, Mandrake, and the tribe. *Actually, if what I understand is correct, then he knows about the Jedi. This might work in our favor.*

Ariq frowned slightly when he heard the weeping, looking over at Jason conversing with the chieftain. *At least someone here is playing the diplomat.* Shaking his head, Ariq looked around, seeing if he can guess where the weeping is from, mostly due to quickly becoming bored. *Not that there is anything wrong with that.*

The chief grunts, and Mandrake translates as he speaks: "We have also lost friends to the Empire. They have disappeared and we believe that they are held in the Imperial station near here. Perhaps you will find that they are 'unwilling guests' too."
He speaks again, and Mandrake says to you, "Hold on a moment." He, the chief and the young native who survived your swamp encounter have a brief, but intense conversation. By its end, the chief is shaking his head. You can't read Felucian expressions even when you catch a glimpse of their features, but there's no doubt he's saddened and regretful. He dismisses the warrior and speaks to Mandrake again, then beckons you with his good hand.
"Come," Mandrake translates. "Come be my guests. I'm sure you can use some food. We can shelter you tonight. Unfortunately we have some empty huts because of the people we have lost to the Empire." He issues a few commands to nearby natives and walks toward his hut.
Ariq focuses even harder this time, and succeeds. Somewhere on the eastern edge of the village there is a strong sense of emotional misery and physical discomfort. He also has the distinct impression of someone weeping again.

Ariq looked over at Jason when he spoke, nodded. "Sure, Jason," was all he said as he walked over to the stretcher and helped lifted it. "We should drop this off at a hut first. I'm not really interested in chit chatting, so I'll go ahead and check the village out.

Anandi and Sajin were quiet for sometime, lost in their own worlds of thought: Sajin in the flow of the Force, and Anandi in her thoughts of vengeance. Sajin's focus turned to Ariq as the youth looked around, then moved to the stretcher. He could read Ariq's body language well enough to know the young man had seen something, or heard something, something that Sajin himself hadn't heard.
Gracefully, Sajin moves up beside him. "Tell me what you saw," he softly whispers.

Anandi was left behind for a moment as the others headed toward the chieftain's hut. Then she realized that everyone is gone and hurried to catch up to them while mentally berating herself for letting her guard down.

Each adult takes a very small portion, and the little that is left is given to the children.
She walks on to the hut, where she lifts a leathery cloth flap that has been glued to the mushroom cap. Inside she finds all the other team members (except Sajin and Ariq) seated around a cookfire with the chief and Mandrake. The smoke is ventilating out a hole cut in the top of the hut, but not quickly enough to prevent the interior from being smoky. The chief is handing out pieces of the spongy material you saw earlier. Artreth sniffs it, and gives it a very dubious look. Mandrake holds up a piece and says quietly, "Make sure you eat some. Don't offend their sense of hospitality."
The chief begins speaking and Mandrake translates: "This friend you seek, you are going to look for him in the prison? We may have information that will help you."

Jason took the spongy morsel, eyeing it a litte and praying that he isn't allergic. *That would be the height of irony, getting killed by dining on a piece of food instead of becoming food.* Pushing the thought aside, Jason ate the morsel, chewing it a little before swallowing.**
When Mandrake finished translating, Jason thought for a second before giving an answer. "We believe that our friend is located at small outpost or base not too far from here, maybe a half day or two trek." Jason wasn't too sure how much he should reveal to them, but quickly discarded the idea. "We were told it was a bolt hole to keep unwanted prisoners out of the way. It's secrecy was it's main defense, but beyond that we have no idea what's inside besides our friend. Do you know anything about the place."
Silently, Jason also thought about how to ease the plight on these people. *Just have to figure out what they're willing to give up in exchange.*
**Taste Check, aisle four!!!
-----=====-----
Ariq helped double checked the gear while Jason and the rest of the group went inside, not too thrilled about meetings and such. *Not that there is anything wrong with that. But I don't want to cause an incident just yet.* Absently, Ariq started thinking about the pain sorrow that he felt, trying to figure out what it was when Sajin spoke from behind him. *He shouldn't be doing that.*
Quickly gather his wits, Ariq turned to Sajin. "I'm not sure, Saj." Ariq looked around, hoping none of the Felucians understood or were in earshot. "But something is wrong here. I don't knwo what it is, but something definetely is wrong."
With out a second thought, Ariq secured the gear before standing up and started walking a few steps to where he felt the pain and suffering, before looking back at Sajin. "You coming, man, or not?"

As Anandi enters the tent, she looks away from the Felucians outside. They had so little here . . . it wasn't fair, this life they had. It wasn't fair the way the Empire had taken her parents from her, either. She could at least do something about the latter. The former . . . maybe not.
She settled down around the fire with the others and graciously took the sponge when offered. She couldn't eat it, though--not when they had so little and she had so much, comparatively speaking. Instead, she stayed quiet as she waited for the Felucian to answer Jason's question.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sajin nodded, as he watched the last of his team enter the hut. "I am." He followed Ariq away to the source of whatever it had been he'd heard. His sense were on guard and alert for anything out of the ordinary--well, out of the ordinary for this world, at least.

In the hut, Mandrake translates for the chief:
"The prison is in an area that used to be a prime hunting ground for our village. Now we call it 'the vanishing place.' We avoid it as best we can, but many of our people have disappeared. Some of the shamans from the surrounding villages went to find what was wrong, but they had to leave quickly before they were overwhelmed with pain."
"I believe our missing people are being held inside, and the Empire is doing something to cause them great agony. The pain seems to be most concentrated on the west side of the facility."
After translating this, Mandrake cocks an eyebrow and says, "I have a present I'd like you to deliver to the Imperials, if you don't mind. It's in my hut."
Outside, Sajin and Ariq walk through the village. The sense of pain fades in and out due to their relative inexperience with the Force, but they still have no problem determining the proper direction. Soon they can hear the weeping that Ariq had heard through the Force, and as they reach the hut the sound is coming from they can see
a scene of misery through the doorway. Four Felucian children lie on pallets, their skin faded to a sickly gray and their muscles thinned to the point that they are visibly too weak to support their weight. They are nearly immobile except when they cry out in pain. Nearby, a Felucian female weeps, rocking back and forth. Two others sit staring at the floor of the hut, and a male, possibly a shaman, tends to one of the children.

Jason remains alittle tight lipped as Mandrake translated. *That explains why this vilage is in such disrepair and the lack of food.* When Mandrake finished explianing and mentioned delivering a gift to the Imperials, Jason cocked an eye brow.
"What type of gift are we talking about," Jason questioned before turning to the Chieftain. After hearing what Mandrake meant, Jason continued. "If your people are being captured in there, we'll try to find out what happened. Can you tell us about the patrols here?"
-----=====-----
Ariq looks around, feeling the pain and sorrow through the Force and with his eyes. *What's happening to these people?* Ariq looked over at Sajin, noting the Jedi's demeaner. "We should go back to the group. Jason may want to hear about this."

Sajin ignores Ariq's questions as he walks into the hut. He looks down at one of the Felucian children--a young girl, he thinks, though he's not really sure. He brings a hand to her forehead and lays it against it, expecting it to be burning hot but finding icy cold instead.
When the girl looked up at him, he whispers, "We will find a way to help you, youngling. Honor demands it."
He then turns and strides from the hut, his hand curling around his lightsaber hilt in a white-knuckled grip. "Let's go, Ariq." It was time to face those Imperial bastards.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the mention of the Imps causing the Felucians' pain, Anandi nodded. "I'd believe it."
She leaned back, against one of the hut's walls and folded her arms across his chest. She nodded at Jason's question. "Knowing the patrol routes are important, but we don't have much of a choice either way. We have to get in there. And I'm assuming this gift to the Imperials won't like very much, right?"

Mandrake smiles broadly at Anandi. "Oh yes, lady, they won't like it one bit. But the good news for them is they won't have long to feel bad about it. As for Imperial patrols, we can't really track them effectively; we aren't a military organization, after all. But you're right, if you want to liberate this friend of yours, you'll have to chance it."
Mandrake turns to the chief and begins speaking to him in Felucian, presumably giving him a summary of the conversation you were having in Basic, and this develops into a short conversation between the two. While they are talking, Grates is exchanging hurried whispers with Artreth. Then Grates digs something out of his utility belt and hands it to Artreth, then Artreth starts digging in his gear. He clears his throat with a rumble.
"Since you have shown us kindness even after the Empire has made it harder for you to feed your families, my comrade and I want to return your generosity." He places 20 days worth of ration packs in front of the chief. "I cannot say they are tasty, but they will nourish your people."
Mandrake translates this and the chief's response: "Your kindness honors us. Perhaps we are not finished helping you. I will consult with my warriors and see if there is a way we can assist you on your mission."
As he says this, Ariq and Sajin appear at the door of the hut, looking very grim.
((Guys, let's just cut to the hut with the children, unless you feel doing something else first is absolutely necessary.))

Sajin's grimace darkened as he stepped into the hut. He didn't say anything, leaving that to Ariq, but the look on his face spoke volumes. He was not happy about something, and it looked as if he was near ready to kill someone.
Anandi stood up straight when she saw Sajin enter. "What did the Empire do this time?" she asked.
She forced her way out of the hut and looked around, her dark eyes taking in the whole camp. "Which way?" she growled, blaster already in hand.
(I have no problem cutting to it.)

Jason nodded when Grates and Artreth handed over the rations packs, but inside grimaced. *Have no idea how this might affect their diet. But hopefully some good would come of it.* Just as he was about to speak again, Ariq and Sajin stepped through, the look of vengeance on Sajin's face and the concern on Ariq's made Jason frown.
Before he could say anything, Anandi noticed Sajin and stood straight up. "What did the Empire do this time," was all she said as she made her way to the door, blaster in hand. Jason took a moment, before looking over at the chieftain and Mandrake before he stood up.
-----=====-----
Ariq immediately went wide eyed as Anandi almost barreled him over. "Whoa, Anandi, calm down a bit." Raising his hands to slow her down, Ariq looked over at Jason and the others. "We went around the village because we felt something wrong and discovered a hut full of sick kids. By the sounds of it, you guys heard of that the Empire might be doing other things here."
-----=====-----
Jason let Ariq's words sink in a bit, before looking at the others, Mandrake, and the chief. Letting his thoughts gather, Jason looked back at Ariq. "Take me there," was all he said before stepping out. "And calm down a bit, Anandi, unless you are trained in medicine."

((For Jason))
The dawn is turning the eastern sky from gray to lavender streaked with orange as you leave the hut that contained the formerly sick younglings, your medical kit slung over your shoulder. It's been a rough night, but a strong antiviral medicine has cured them. They're still weak and will need a day or two of bed rest before they try to walk again, but there's no doubt they will fully recover. Even Mandrake is amazed, since he has seen the Felucians' healing arts up close and was sure that any local disease beyond them would be too much for any medic to handle. It took you some time to pull free from the repeated embraces of the ecstatic parents and the amazed shaman, but now it's time to go. The shaman catches you at the door. He motions Mandrake over to translate, and hands you five small bundles wrapped in some sort of leathery leaf. "Your healing powers are great, but I have seen in a vision that these medicine bags will be helpful to you." He briefly pooints out the components, and you find that it's a sort of primitive answer to a medpac. He bows and turns back to attending to the increasingly restless younglings. Thanking him, you stroll out through the dirt lane between the huts.
Hearing footsteps behind you, you look back and notice Ariq is following. He spent the night sitting vigil with you, dozing some of the time and trying to learn some of the Felucian language from the shaman the rest of the time. Now he strides confidently along, although he looks a bit tired.
It's very quiet and you don't see any Felucians around at first.
((For Anandi))
Your sleep was blissfully restful, up until you had the dream. Every Iktotchi can instinctively tell what dreams are visions of the future and this was definitely one of them. It was a short, simple image: It was as if you were walking around one of the huge Felucian plants, one with leaves a meter or more across that are a lovely deep purple. One of the leaves is splattered liberally with blood, so much blood that it's running down and dripping off the leaf's sharp point in fat drops.
After that, you laid awake. You know that the Imperials will kill someone who leaves this village with you tomorrow, perhaps you, perhaps more than one of you. You lay awake until dawn, too enraged to sleep anymore. As the sky begins to light, you gather your gear, stretch and leave the hut you were given for shelter. You're sure to take the "present" that Mandrake gave you before you turned in. It's a large explosive charge with an integral timer. He's sure (and you agree) that it's large enough to destroy the comme center and disrupt Imperial communications all over the planet.
((For everyone))
Passing through the village, your team comes together and you walk toward the kybuck corral. Mandrake and most of the Felucians are gathered there. A warrior stands apart from the group, holding the reins of seven of the animals. There is a quiet murmuring of guttural conversation, which turns to a whooping (the Felucian version of applause, perhaps?) as you are spotted. After letting the adulation go on for a few moments, the chief steps out of the group and holds up a hand. Silence falls across the crowd instantly. The chief begins speaking, and Mandrake translates:
"When you first came to us, you were attacked, and in spite of this, you have shared your food and your healing wisdom with us. Because of this, and because of the evil of the Empire, we are sending one of our best warriors with you as a guide. Mandrake has agreed to let you use his kybucks, to shorten your journey."
"May you find success. Mandrake has taught me a phrase from your culture, and I wish you this today: Good hunting."
Mandrake adds, "Goodbye, new friends. Good hunting and make it home safe."
The guide silently mounts his kybuck and waits for you to mount yours. Gurgling sharply at his mount, he rides out of the camp and your animals instinctively follow.
((Saronian, those medicine bundles count as medpacs and will fit in your medical bag in the pouches that are designed tol hold normal medpacs. Keep in mind that because they are primitive, you're at -1 to use them on a Treat Injury check. If any of you need me to edit any portion of this post because of something your character would have done different, say so in the OCC thread.))

Jason couldn't keep the exhaustion from his face as he made his way out the hut, recieving hugs from relieved parents of the children when administered a strong antiviral drug that was standard in most medpacks. *But nothing that these people had access to,*he thought when Mandrake looked over at him and mentioned what he had experienced while living among them. *They can definetely use the technology the galaxy can bring them. After all, the galaxy has brought it's touch and these people wont be able to ignore it for long.*
Just as Jason was about pack up the gear, Felucians started gathering around, each giving him a hug for the good that was done. It was the last Felucian that came forward, the Shaman, that surprised Jason. With Mandrake translating, Jason mentally catalogued the various plants that was in the primitive medpacks. *I'll have to save one, probably two, of them. That way Loronar will have some more info on this place.* Reorganizing his thoughts, Jason carefully reconsidered. *On the other hand, Alderaan Biotics can do the research and put forth a more reasonable offer. I'll have to check with Senator Organa about that.*
Thanking the shaman, Jason asked Mandrake to stay behind while he put the primitive madpacks into the case, then started asking questions about the people, their lifestyles, and anyother resources they may have acces to as well as those they can use from the galaxy at large. Once they were both mentally tired from it, Jason went to sleep for a couple of hours.
(OOC: Way I see it, staying up all night working will tire anyone out, Jason is going to try to catach some rack time before he rides some animal. At least, that's how I see it.)

The route you take on the kybucks has many of the same difficulties as the first trip into the jungle. The day quickly grows hot and humid, and there are still insects everywhere, but somehow following a guide on a mount makes a world of difference. You wind your way for hours through fungal swamps where large, multicolored fungi droop low over the landscape, and huge birds swoop down to scoop up prey, then through a series of hollow logs and natural tunnels where occasional shafts of light stab down from the ceiling.
Not long after that, the guide dismounts, signalling for you to do so, and ties the kybuck herd to a stand of sapling-like plants that are a garish orange. A moment later, he's led you to within sight of the Imperial prison. You all peer out at it from between the leaves of various plants. The facility is a relatively squat, two-story building in characteristic Imperial style: gray walls with a slight inward slant, no visible windows, and a plain visage that leaves no room for decoration. The second story of the building is visibly smaller than the ground floor, and blinking lights line the top floor’s edges. A large set of blast doors denotes the ground floor entry to the building, while a single gun turret (which appears to be an E-Web blaster built into the wall) juts out a few meters to the door’s left. Otherwise, there are no other visible entrances or exits to the facility. Four stormtroopers stand guard at the blast doors, while the low hum of speeder engines indicates that there might be scout troopers on patrol nearby. Anandi and Jason, listening carefully, each catch heavy thudding sounds in the distance, along with the noises of plants being crushed, indicating the presence of a walker of some kind.
As you wonder how you'll be able to get in, the guide motions for you to follow and leads you to the northwest corner of the prison. As you huddle in the bushes again, he points out a ventilation grate that is at the average humanoid's eye level. It's bolted onto the side of the building, but you see nothing that would prevent it from being removed. Looking around, you don't see any Imperials in the area.
((Saronian, objection noted but...hey, you're Army, you know how much you can get out of a highly motivated guy in his mid-20s even after he's missed some rack time. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

Jason looked at the others, back at the grate, then around for any signs of the Imperials before grabbing his shoulder pack. "I'll be able to take that grate down and we can sneak inside. Ariq, let the guide know we're good and he can head back with the kybucks."
Moving over to the gate, Jason putting the pack down and opening it up. Jason quickly pulled out a case of tools and a mechanic's visor, before checking to see if the was any wires that'll be a dead give away for any sensors.

((Posting because dealing with Saronian's post couldn't really step on anyone else's turn))
Jason finds no security wiring on the grate. It is securely bolted to the side of the building with eight bolts. Peering into the grate he gets a slight glimpse of a nutplate that one of the bolts feeds into. So, the bolts can be removed from the outside with a wrench, or a fusion torch could be used to cut the rest of the grate away from the bolted frame. The wrench method will be quieter, but take longer. A lightsaber could do the same work and only be soemwhat louder than the torch, but it's unlikely any of them would be heard unless a trooper is relatively close.
As Jason examines the grate, Artreth crouches in a way that reminds the rest of you of a coiled spring, ready to charge out and defend Jason if Imperials show up, or move out to use his lightsaber on the grate if called on. Grates is looking down the sights of his commando rifle, looking toward the Southwest corner, which is where any troopers coming from the front door to investigate noise or alarms would appear. His body and breathing are relaxed, but his concentration appears to be total and intense.

With the bolts burned away with the torch, Jason nodded for Ariq and Sajin to help him pull the grate off, before double checking to see if any one took notice. "Ok, Sajin, you and Artreth go in first. Grates will be behind you, I'll come in with the equipment, Ariq and Anandi will cover the rear." Looking around and packing his gear as he waited for Sajin, Ariq, and Grates moved in, Jason checked to see if the guide was still with them, saluted, then went in. *Hopefully Ariq told the guide to head back.*
-----=====-----
Ariq quickly helped Jason with the grate when he was done, then went over to the guide, doing his best to translate what Jason said. *At least, I hope that's what I said.*
Silently, Ariq went over to the ventilation shaft and crawled in, his Force senses stretched out to make sure no ugly surprises occur.

Artreth cracks his neck, ginning as he says, "All right, let's go! This should be fun!" He wastes no time in ducking through the opening left by the now-absent grate. As he does, he unhooks his lightsaber from his belt, twirling the inactive cylinder in his hand eagerly. "I don't know why, but it feels like I've been asleep for nine months! I can't *wait* to cut loose on something!" However, still mindful of what happened the last time he recklessly charged into a firefight, he keeps his senses alert, looking for any sign of danger.

Anandi had been unusually quiet that day, speaking only to curse the Empire for this or that. Sajin had tried to ask her about it, but she refused to say anything at all.
She knew someone was going to die, but that didn't mean she had to sit and take it. Her ears and eyes were stretched to their limit, taking in everything, making sure she did her best to keep them all alive for as long as she could.
Sajin had stayed close to Anandi, watching her carefully, worried. He knew something was bothering her--and if it was bothering her, it was a concern for everyone.
When they arrived at the prison, both carefully watched their surroundings during their approach and as Jason cut open the grate. When the soldier ordered Sajin through first, the ex-Jedi nodded. He took his lightsaber in hand and climbed into the hole, peering carefully around to make sense of where he was.
Anandi stayed a few meters out from the rest of the group, listening to the sounds of the walkers in the distance, making sure none were on an approach.

Piling out of the short duct that leads in from the vent, you find yourselves at a 90 degree bend in a corridor 3 meters wide. One stretch of corridor leads south and the other leads east. The walls are metal, and the area has the familiar look of Republic and Imperial government facilities. No doors are visible from your current position. The air is cool and dry, an almost startling change from the humidity and heat outside. You hear the hum of power and ventilation equipment, but otherwise it's as quiet as a tomb. Neither Artreth or Sajin sense anything unusual through the Force.

By the time the others had climbed out of the duct, Sajin was several meters down the eastern corridor, and he came striding back as Anandi, the last of them, climbed from the duct.
Anadi looked around with a grimace on her face. "I have a bad feeling about this," she said. "It's too easy. Someone should have tried to stop us by now. We didn't have to do any work at all to get it."
Though he didn't feel anything amiss, he searched the Force, trying to decide which path was the best one to take.

Jason crawled out of the duct, his hand cannon already out and his senses up as he stood up.  *East or south*, he thought as he looked around, then looked over at Grates, hoping the mercenary had any experience here.
*Then again, that gun that is south of here is probably manned,* reflected Jason when the Jedi started asking questionsand Anandi made her statement. *Great, now the Force is going to bushwack in the groin.*
Clearing his thoughts, Jason considered his options. "Personally, that heavy weapon to out south is likely manned. I would recommend taking it out before we do anything else. Unless some one else has an idea?"

### **Anonymous** (2009-11-20 01:17:43)

Grates was tempted for a long moment. *There's a fight in that direction for sure. Maybe a pretty nasty one…but if we start off with that, we may never get that bunghole admiral out of here.* He shook his head. "No, let's go east," his voice low and gravelly. "A crew served weapon means a crew. We'd probably outnumber them, but it would be loud putting them down, and if they can swing that E-Web around to point inside, they'll cook us like bird meat. Plus, there's a slit the gun points out, if we have a fight in there the stormies outside will hear it, and they'll have plenty of time to report it. Besides, most of this dump is to the east of us, so the target is probably in that direction. I'll take point."
Artreth sees that the south corridor jogs southeast about 15 meters from the corner the rest of the group is standing in. He doesn't hear anything other then the same power and ventilation noise he's been hearing since he entered the prison.
Sajin senses danger in both directions, but the eastern corridor seems to be the way he should go.

Jason considered what Grates said. "That's true, Grates. But at the same time, we don't want some one to try to play hero when we leave that explosive behind. Not too mention I'm interested in permenantly taking this place offline." Jason looked at the other. "But you are right. We need to get the admiral out first, then rig this place to blow."
Jason looked east, then at the group. "Sajin, you and Artreth keep near Grates and get ready to slice your way through any one that sees us." Jason double checked his blaster, seeing it had a fresh clip, and looked at Anandi. "Anandi and Ariq, cover our rear. That means blaster unless you can tackle the guy, Ariq."
Jason walked over to Grates. "You might have point, but I'm staying close in case you go down, ok? Let's go."
-----=====-----
Ariq barely rolled his eyes when Jason mentioned using a blaster, then thought better of it. *He's right. I don't want to go down again because I was dumb enough to run at an enemy with out thinking.* Casually, he pulled out his blaster, holding it up, and looking at Anandi. "Ready to go for this, Anandi?"

Cracking his knuckles with a confident smirk on his face, Artreth resumed twirling his still-inactive saber hilt in anticipation. "Sure, whatever. As long as today ends with a bunch of stormies in multiple pieces and me still in one, I'm happy." He remained crouched slightly, ready to bolt into battle at a moments notice, but waiting for their impromptu leader's word before doing so.

Anandi snorted at Ariq's question. "When am I not ready?" Her blaster was in her hand already, having never left it since they set foot on Felucia's surface. "I don't much care which way we go, as long as we go, and we kill someone at the end."
Sajin ignored Jason's orders and wandered out in front of the group, keeping a steady pace in front of them down the eastern corridor. He didn't look back to see if they followed, but he knew this was the way he had to go, whatever the others did. The way may not have been clear, but the eastern one *was* the way to go. He knew that much.
He held his lightsaber loosely in his grip, his thumb hovering over the activation switch, ready to ignite the blade, should anyone come between him and his goal.

"That's mighty nice of you," Grates said to Jason. He kept the sarcasm light (the guy was looking out for his welfare, even if he was being bossy) but it was definitely there. As Sajin walked out in front, he shrugged. Sure, it was at least mildly insulting for this member of the glow-stick-of-death crowd (or anybody for that matter) to take point after he'd claimed it, but why waste time arguing? It wasn't like Sajin would be able to keep every Imperial in the place to himself. The Universe and Grates were going to have quite the little chat, no matter who was in front. Keeping his commando special at the ready, he followed closely behind Sajin, keeping as quiet as possible.
The corridor bends to the south and after a few meters opens up into a well-lit wider room that appears to be a central common area roughly 12 by 25 meters. On the west side of the area is a wall with two doors set in it, one close to the northern end and one close to the southern end. On the north wall are two doors, and a corridor extends off to the east for about 9 or 10 meters before dead-ending. The east wall has a single door right in the center of the wall. In the middle of the common area is a cluster of four turbolifts.
The area remains deathly quiet, with only the hum of power and ventilation equipment in the background.

Artreth whips his head left and right, as though trying to find something. After a few moments, he decides whatever it is he is looking for lies in a general westward direction. Ignoring the others, he creeps over to and places his ear against the west wall, listening for something.

Jason follows Grates as they made their way out of the corridor, looking around for a computer terminal and frowning when he doesn't spot one immediately. *This is prime*, he thought as he considered which way to go and was about to ask when he noticed Artreth move over to the wall. *What the hell* started to form up in Jason's brain when Ariq slowly moved over to where Art was.
-----=====-----
Ariq frowned as he stepped over, the Force letting into him the words of the Felucian speech, though they were distant and distorted. *Hmm, something not right here*, was his thoughts as he placed a hand on Art's shoulder.
"You hear it, too, don't you?"
Ariq barely let the words sink before turning to Jason. "Hey boss, there might be something over here dealing with the Felucians. We should check it out."
(Use the Force +6 to sense what is behind door "number 1")
-----=====-----
Jason mulled on what Ariq said, looking over at Grates, than at Anandi. "We need to find the Admiral first, then plant the explosives." Jason pursed his lips, then arefully considering his options. *But should we check it out?*
"We need to find a terminal first, finding out where the Admiral is." Jason looked over at Grates, then cocked his head at the doors to the north. "Let's check this room first. We go in a clockwise motion until we either find a terminal or the Admiral."

By the time Jason starts speaking, Anandi is already past the south door on the west wall, heading up to the second door. "No, Jason. We're going in here."
She slaps the door panel, and waits for it to open, her blaster aimed at the area she knew the "doctor" was going to be standing.
Sajin is not far behind Ariq and Artreth as they approach the west wall. His eyes follow Anandi as he walks north, and a knot formed in the pit of his stomach. Something was not right here, that much he knew.
(Anandi is readying an action to shoot the "doctor" if he appears on the other side of the door. If I can, I'll use Desperate Gambit if I roll less than a 10. Her blaster should be set to kill.)

((I'm going to describe this for Anandi. The rest of you are left to determine--because I know you can handle it--what your characters can see, etc. Keep in mind that your characters are all pretty close to the northern door unless they made a special effort to move south.))
This large chamber seems at first to be a place of healing—at least, until you take a closer look. Large bacta tanks line one border of the room, and other medical equipment is distributed haphazardly throughout the area. Operating tables and chairs like those used for dental work, all with clamps and other restraint devices, seem to be scattered throughout the room with no real pattern to their arrangement, and the place has the same sterile smell as a medical bay.
Just north of the bacta tanks is a computer terminal. A human male with thinning iron-gray hair is standing in front of it. Dressed in the sterile white robes of doctors throughout the galaxy, the man seems to be little more than a scientist. The insignia of the Empire sits on a patch on each shoulder, but otherwise he looks like a normal medical researcher. A 2-1b medical droid stands next to him.
Between you and the door is an operating table, with a bearded young human male lying unconscious on it. There are restraints on his wrists and ankles, and one across his midsection. In the center of the room is another table, with a Felucin restrained on it, and at the south end of the room are three of the "dental" chairs. Two are empty, but the middle one is occupied by another restrained Felucian. They've clearly undergone some kind of mutation; their muscles bulge and their bodies seem to bend in unnatural places. Both creature’s right forearms have been removed entirely, and instead a long bone blade extends from the elbow, growing out of the flesh with a ragged, serrated edge. Thick, tough-looking scales grow out of their bodies, and you think the scales came from some other species entirely.
The man in the white robes is turning his head to loook at the door as Anandi fires her raised pistol. He cries out as her bolt strikes him in the center of his back. He sags to his knees, then to the floor. As he does, he gropes for and pushes a button on the panel. The restraints on the Felucians release. They rise and move menacingly toward her.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Here's a map of the room. The crates at the south end represent the "dental" chairs. The thing against the north wall is a lab bench covered with scattered medical gear, the one against the east wall is a set of two lockers.

((The following is the first action of round one. Sajin goes next and so on, but as usual you can post in any order and I'll synthesize the results.))
Both felucians roar, an ear-splitting roar that sounds like it came from deep inside a nightmare. Both move toward Anandi; the one from the central table moves swiftly to the foot of the operating table with the human on it and then charges. He raises his serrated bone blade high and slams it down onto her, cutting her savagely. As she struggles to remain standing (the force of the blow by itself nearly drove her to her knees) he roars again in her face and prepares to strike her again. She is dimly aware that the other felucian has moved close to the south side of the door.

Jason's eyes went wide when Anandi hits the open button and stepped in. *Well, there goes plan A and B,* he thought as he slapped his head with his empty hand, closing his eyes as he heard the shot from her blaster. *This is not happening.*
Shortly after, the sound of something from the depths of hell resounded from the room, bringing him up. "Oh, frak me," he said as he looked over at Grates, trying to make sense on the situation.
-----=====-----
Ariq heard the roar, spring into action to press the open button, firing at the first beast he sees, knowing that even they were innocent, they had to be taken down first in order to save Anandi. *Stars forgive me*, he thought as he lined up for his second shot, *for what I must do.*

The sound of Ariq's blaster drove Jason back to the living, heading down to Anandi, blaster ready inhand in case someone was going to crash the party.

Sajin reacted with almost preternatural instinct, moving for the Felucian by the north door before it attacked Anandi. He wasn't fast enough, though, and it brutally attacked her.
A broad grimace splitting his face, he swung his saber around, igniting its blade as he did so, aiming to remove the Felucian's head from its body.
Anandi, meanwhile, stifled a cry of pain as she stumbled back, clutching her wounded shoulder with her free hand. Orange-red blood poured from her wound, soaking through her jumpsuit. She raised her arm, shaky from blood loss, and fired at the Felucian in front of her.
That shot seemed to wear her out, and she stumbled backwards. She was not going to show weakness and cry out for help--besides, Sajin was there with his lightsaber. She hoped to the Force he was good enough.

Sajin moves swiftly through the door, his blade humming in an arc toward the Felucian's head as he passes the creature in a fluid motion. The creature recoils and the blade carves a furrow in the side of it's head, cutting a number of head tentacles free and producing a nightmarish roar of pain and rage. Sajin moves further, making his way to the operating table in the hopes that he can protect the unknown human and draw the creature's attention away from Anandi.
As the wounded creature turns on Sajin, Artreth steps through the door and tries to decapitate him, but he misjudges his swing and cuts through only air.
As Jason looks over at Grates, he's unhurriedly looking around, moving his eyes in turn to every entrance to the common area. "All that noise means we're going to have company. Stormtrooper company. Heck, some of the guys we killed yesterday might wake up and come to the party." He pauses. "I'll cover you." As he finishes, he looks to the southwest, focusing on the running footsteps he hears from that direction.
Anandi hesitates the slightest bit, waiting for a shot past Artreth, and squeezes the trigger. Shock must be affecting her, because her shot goes just wide.
The 2-1B droid strides toward Sajin and tries to cut him with a scalpel. Fortunately it misses as he suddenly notices its presence and steps aside.
Ariq steps into the doorway, and sees Sajin is beset by a droid on one side and an enraged Felucian on the other. He brings his pistol up and blasts the Felucian's back, striking it on some of the armor plates grafted there. He's definitely done some damage, but the creature seems completely focused on Sajin and barely stirs when the bolt hits.
Jason reaches Anandi and sees that her wound is ragged, deep and bleeding profusely.
((End of Round 1. Felucians get their next turn...))
The wounded Felucian screams in rage as he drives his bone blade down toward Sajin's head. Sajin nimbly dodges to the side (back in the direction he just came!), unharmed. The other Felucian rumbles deep in its throat and swings viciously at Ariq, just barely missing his skull as the padawan ducks under the weapon.
((OK, round recap: Sajin knocked the first Felucian down the condition track. The next is completely unharmed. Grates has an action readied for the arrival of whoever is running toward the common area. Saronian, if Jason is going to treat injury next round, let me know. Moda, I didn't use Desperate Gambit on that attack roll because you seemed to want her ref def amped up more than you wanted the hit...if you have a problem with that, let me know and I'll use Desperate Gambit in the future.))

The sound of the claw breezing by his head was enough for Ariq to drop the blaster, assuming a classis strike form his master taught him. *Damn, was not expecting this*, was all he could do as he started shifting his weight to his back foot. *But I'm damn well not going to have them take on two of these frakkers at the same time.*
"Hey, hurry up and take him down before this guy turns me into a shishkabob," Ariq said as he started weaving back and forth.
-----=====-----
*Sounds like they're having fun in there,* Jason thought as he made it to Anandi. "Perfect timing, girl," Jason said humorously. "Next time let's wake every one up with a nuclear detonation."
Warily, Jason looked inside, noting that the Jedi were holding up on their own, a med droid trying to play hero, and the Feucian that was bearing down on Ariq. Jason was about to shoot at the Felucian dancing with Ariq, but reconsidered it since some one might be coming up to crash the party.
*Hope Sajin doesn't destroy the droid. We can use him to heal everyone that gets injured.*

Anandi snorted at Jason's comment. "Hadn't thought of that."
She exerted more pressure on her bleeding arm as she tried to stop the blood flow. Her arm was growing numb with blood loss, forcing her to concentrate more on her shot this time. Her fingers tingled a bit as she pulled the trigger and released another shot at the Felucian.
Sajin was more than ready to take out these Felucians and be done with it. He turned his saber on the one in front of him, ignoring the droid--it was only a droid, after all. Though he'd seen battle droids during the Clone Wars, he'd also seen his share of medical droids. They were never a threat, and he hoped this one was no different.
(Generally speaking, yeah, I'll use Desperate Gambit on most rolls under 10, excluding times when I'm trying to boost by RefDef or am otherwise trying to avoid getting hit (like retreating). Most of the time I do use it, though, I'll point it out. If I'm below half hit points (like now) I won't unless I'm, you know, desperate.

As Sajin finishes his sidestep he spins on his heel, his saber blurring into a white arc as it decapitates the Felucian. The head rolls away toward the bacta tanks and the body stands still for just a moment before falling backwards and crashing to the floor.
At the southwest end of the common area, two stormtroopers run out of a side corridor, carbines at the ready. Grates is ready for them, and cuts them down with a burst of fire. Two other stormtroopers peer around the corner and take shots at him with their blaster rifles, but both miss, their blaster bolts slamming into the floor on either side of him.
Jason aims carefully at one of the stormtroopers at the corner and squeezes off a shot, but the Imperial pulls his head back just in time.
Artreth turns and leaps toward the remaining Felucian, timing his swing so that Ariq is well out of the way. The saber cuts a deep, straight upward furrow through armor plate and muscle, eliciting a scream of pain and rage.
Anandi watches the first monster's head bounce off the floor and switches targets. She hits the Felucian dead center, but the damage is reduced by a bony plate. She gets up and moves behind the operating table with the human on it, and ducks low for cover.
The 2-1B droid takes another stab at Sajin and buries the blade of the scalpel in his shoulder.
Ariq uses deft footwork movements his master taught him to throw the Felucian's aim off, but the creature's fury is shifting to the one who burned a furrow in his chest: Artreth.
Loud klaxons begins hooting throughtout the station, and a cool male voice comes over a public address system. "Intruders have been detected near the medical bay. Execute defensive plan Gamma. This is not a drill."
((End of round one. Felucian turn...))
The remaining Felucian lets out another bloodcurdling roar, rears back and slams his blade down on Artreth. It strikes him on the head, and though the blow doesn't fracture his skull or knock him unconscious, it does disorient him slightly and blood begins to run down into his eyes from a nasty laceration.
((Sorry Moda, the droid rolled a natural 20. That's 3 whole points of damage. Hope he can take it. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->...Artreth takes 17 points of damage and moves 1 step down the condition track.

Sajin doesn't even recoil as the blade was buried in his shoulder. Instead--the handle still protruding from his tunic--he spun on his heel, his saber horizontal as he aimed to remove the Felucian's head for its shoulders. The droid he could worry about later.
Blood still poured from Anandi's wound, though she managed to staunch the bleeding some. She aimed carefully at the medical droid, trying to avoid hitting Sajin or the others around him. It was not the best of situations, what with blood loss and all, so she braced her arm over the bearded man's chest before firing. At least it kept her stable.

((Sorry for the delay...appreciate your patience.))
Sajin swings his saber and deftly removes the Felucian's head. The body crashes to the floor.
Outside in the common area, Grates raises his rifle and carefully aims at the doorway where the two stormtroopers are hiding. He shoots as one of them sticks his head out to fire, but his shot misses, creating a burn mark on the wall near the trooper's head. Suddenly, both troopers stick their heads out, one high and one low. Jason shoots at the low one and misses, making another burn mark on the wall. The lower trooper lets off several shots in Grates' direction, pinning him down. The high trooper throws a grenade out.
*That figures,* Grates thinks to himself as the grenade soars toward him. He reacts quickly enough to throw himself to the floor, and Jason is quick enough to pull back into the limited protection of the doorway. The grenade lands about a meter south of the doorway and explodes with a roar made even louder from being concentrated in the space between the wall and the turbolift cluster. Flame laced with shrapnel washes over Grates body, and more shrapnel is launched outward, cutting into Jason. The ringing in their ears is so loud it seems to drown out every other sound in creation.
Artreth steps behind Sajin to defend him from the medical droid, which is renewing its attack. It must be a good day for decapitations, because he lops the droid's head off and it bounces off the floor with a clank. Unfortunately, the 2-1B's main processor is in its torso, and the droid keeps stabbing out blindly with the scalpel. Anandi, aiming carefully and bracing herself on the body of the bearded man, blasts a hole clean through the torso and it drops to the floor in a jumble of limbs.
Ariq moves to check Jason, and finds that he's fully conscious and his wounds are minor. He steps over to the doorway and fires off a blaster bolt toward the stormtroopers. One of them has stuck his head out to check the results of the grenade attack, and Ariq's shot makes a burn mark on his helmet. The trooper disappears from view, and Ariq isn't sure if he's just killed him or grazed him.
((Round recap: All enemies in the medical bay are dead. Grates and Jason each took 8 points of damage. There are either one or two stormtroopers left alive.
Saronian, even though you didn't call your attack a readied action, I treated it as one because it made mechanical and story sense.
Zen, I have to admit that Artreth did enough damage to kill that thing three times over...hope you don't mind me having a little cinematic fun.
At this point, Jason and Ariq pretty much have the cover at the northern door used up, so anyone else who wants to engage the stormies will have to either move through the door out of cover or move to the southern door. Is anyone doing anything with the bearded human on the operating table?))

"Frakking son of a gungan*," Jason started saying as he decided that with Ariq there helping Grates, he better pull out the medical gear. "Ariq, you may want to south. Don't you to get hit by a grenade, and it makes sure we don't get boxed in."
Quickly, Jason moved over to the closest unoccupied bed and put his kit on it, openning the box before noticing the 2-1B droid in pieces and on the floor. "Damn, I could've used that." Glancing over at Anandi, Jason pulled out his remaining medpack he came with to this planet and two of the Felucian medpacks. *I'm going to be using mine just yet.*
Looking over at Anandi, Jason put as much emphasis as he can in his voice. "Girl, get over here. I want to leave this planet alive and I'm going to need your pistol and quick reflexes for that." Glancing Artreth, Jason nodded to the various medical supplies. "Arty, please get all the Medical supplies you can get and bring them over here."

Artreth looks down at the sparking droid in front of him, then around the medical bay, surveying his surroundings.

Keeping her blaster in hand, she instead started to unstrap the human from the table, removing any gags or anything, as necessary. She taps him lightly on the cheek. "You all right there? Did they hit you up with anything yet?"
Sajin, meanwhile, heads to the doors and out toward the troops hidden by the wall. There really was only one way to get rid of them--but that didn't mean he had to be stupid about it. He kept his saber pointed upwards, ready to deflect any shots that came his way.

Kon-EL Hiraguun's eyes fluttered open and looked at the young Iktotchi woman patting his face. His green eyes tried to focus, but even if she could tell he had been heavily sedated by the expression in his kind eyes. His mouth tried to form words but failed would confrim it. Once he realized he wasn't able to communicate he instead touched his chest to pull open the white under shirt of his khaki robes to reveal an amulet with the seal of the Jedi Order, and then touched his jedi utility belt in an effort to convey who he was. In one of the pouches was his identity disk, that stated he was Kon-EL Hiraguun. A Jedi Sentinel whom had served in the Grand Army of the Republic.
He let his head fall back on the headrest exhausted from his efforts, and sighed. Hoping that someone would be able to give him something to cancel out the sedatives that made it so hard for him to concentrate.

When Anandi's eyes caught sight of the amulet, she gasped and stumbled backwards. A Jedi . . . he was a Jedi. A thousand questions flooded her mind, but she held back. She had been raised to believe that the Jedi were traitors to the Republic, that they were corrupt, and that they deserved to be killed on sight.
She resisted that impulse when she saw the light in his eyes. There was something there, a humanity that she never believed could have existed. She had no words, and so stood there, silent.

Sajin steps out the door, and as he raises his lightsaber he has the stormtroopers' full attention.
Grates moves to the northwest side of the turbolift cluster and fires toward the troopers as they pop their heads out to make another attack. He misses. Again the stormtroopers lean out, high and low, one sending a barrage of fire Sajin's way and the other tossing a grenade. Sajin deflects a bolt that would have struck him, but the barrage distracts him from the grenade, which arcs over his head to land behind him. Fortunately for him, the stormtrooper was making sure he wouldn't be caught by any stray shrapnel and threw the grenade a bit too far. A few small pieces of shrapnel rip into Sajin, but he's escaped major injury.
In the medical bay, Jason has his gear out and ready. Artreth looks around the bay and it looks as if most of the equipment on the workbench is very specialized; he doesn't recognize any of it. However, there are two lockers. He finds that they're unlocked, and each one contains a medical kit with 5 medpacs already placed in the side pockets. Also, there are small autoinjectors, 5 in each cabinet, that are each already loaded with a drug vial. He doesn't recognize the name. He gathers it all up and brings it to the table.
Anandi can see that the green eyed man is only barely conscious.
Ariq opens the door and doesn't see anyone approaching from the east, or hear anyone coming from any other direction.
((Round recap: The Felucians are still dead. There are two stormies left, and Sajin took 8 hit points from the grenade.))

Jason looked up at Artreth when he came up to the table with to med kits and the two cases of autoinjectors. *That's looks interesting*, as Jason frowned, thinking carefully as he considered what they were. *Have to check that out when we get a chance to breathe.*
Shaking his head, Jason motioned for Artreth to get close and lean forward so he can inspect the head wound as he grabbed one of the Imperial medpacks. "I don't know, but I would like you to try not to doing anything too crazy until we get the Admiral." Jason spared a glance over to Anandi and the man on the table, noticing he was somewhat awake.
"Anandi, if you want to help him, grab a medpack and use it. Otherwise," pointing at the headless droid, "can you see if that med droid can be salvage? Thank you."

Anandi stepped back from the table and the man, finally coming to her senses. She was in the middle of a fight right now, she couldn't just stand around. Her training kicked in, and she loosened the man's restraints. She glanced at Artreth. "Anything in there I can give him?"

Sajin grimaced as the shrapnel dug into his bag. He'd had worse before, though. Much worse.
A grimace on his face, he charged the troopers, his silver blade ready to cut through them.

"Uh..." Artreth glaces at the medical supplies, not knowing what any of them actually do. He grabs a medpac and one of the autoinjectors, holding them up for Anandi to see. "Well we got a bunch of these and a bunch of these. Hopefully you know what they actually do better than me."

(I know it's out of order, but I figure to add me two cents in before Master Silverback comes back.)
Jason was mildly annoyed when Anandi asked what should she do. *That definetely needs to be amended,* Jason thought as he went back to fixing Artreth. He also grew mildly shocked when he recommended that they use the auto injectors and quickly objected to. "Hold it. Unless you know what it is, put it back, Anandi." Jason glanced over at the guy on the stretcher as she undid the shackles. "No offense, but it sounds like you two haven't done anything with a med pack, so I request that you leave me to fixing people and you can burn holes into them. Besides, what if that is sodium chloride?"
*Wonder if they caught that.*, Jason thought as he remembered his own wounds. *Should work on that. Then again, I can always wait until we get out of here. Hopefully.*

"Whoa, easy there," Anandi said to the Jedi she was helping. Then, she glared at Jason. "I know what I'm doing, soldier. I may not be a doctor, but I can inject a stimulant. I just can't read the labels from here." She took a deep breath to calm herself before she shot someone, then said to Jason. "If you'll toss me a mild stimulant, I'll be fine."

*You have a point, Annie,* Jason as he finished his treatment. *But at the same time you gotten us in this mess.* Deciding he wasn't interested in starting another fight just yet, Jason considered his options. "Anandi, I appreciate your help, but I would like to make sure that we don't inadvertantly kill him. Besides, I want to check these out first."
Jason glanced over to the guy on the table, then over at Anandi. "Butr you did help getting out of those straps. So please come over here so that when I'm done with Artreth, I can work on you, then the new guy." Jason manages a slight smirk, trying to inject some humor before it had gotten too serious.

Anandi instinctively touches her shoulder. She'd forgotten all about it in her surprise over the Jedi. "I . . . No. I'm not leaving Sajin out there without backup." She gestured at the Jedi. "Him first." There was no doubt in her voice. She was firm and she wasn't going to back down.
She moved to the door, gripping her blaster with her good hand. If she had to shot someone, she would do it.

Seeing Anandi head out the door just brought a dissappointed look and a frown, Jason finished dressing Artreth's head wound. "Hopefully that doesn't happen again." Jason glanced over at the over guy on the stretcher, then pulled out his medical sensor from a pouch. "As much as her arrogant and short fused personality gets me, she better not cause any more trouble."
Looking back over at Artreth, Jason checked the bandage one more time. "That's as good as I can get it for now. If you want, you can help me or head out and help Grates and Anandi. Honestly, though, the sooner this place gets cleared and we retrieve the Admiral, the better."
Turning, Jason checked out the auto-injectors, picking up one so he will have a better idea what he was doing.

Artreth grins a broad, toothy grin. "I've been thinkin' the same thing." With that, the Cathar Jedi reignites his saber, its green blade casting shadows across the walls of the small room.

Sajin stood his ground and continued his assault on the troopers. It may not have been the most well though out plan in this galaxy, but it should be effective. He was once a Jedi and fought numerous battle droids. Stormtroopers were nothing more than flesh-and-blood droids. He was also one of the most skilled lightsaber combatants alive--that wasn't arrogance, but merely fact. There were too few left in the galaxy and from what he knew, he was in the top three. Given the opportunity, though, he'd gladly go down to number two hundred, if it meant he had a few more fighters on his side. But that just wasn't the way the galaxy worked.
(Standard: Attack+5, dmg: 2d8+7

Anandi stood in the doorway, trying to line up a shot past Sajin's blurring blade. He moved with such quickness that it was hard to get one in . . . but then, there it was. She squeeed the trigger instinctively, her aim on the stormtrooper.

Sajin swings his blade in a deadly arc, but still misses the stormtroopers.
Grates aims carefully, waiting to be sure of his shot. He squeezes the trigger and the trooper who hasn't been hit before goes down with a smoking hole in his helmet.
Jason examines the autoinjectors and finds that they contain a strong stimulant.
The remaining stormtrooper doesn't back down. He fires at Sajin and he feels the heat of the bolt burn his skin as it barely misses. As he ducks away from the blast, Artreth charges in and cuts the trooper down with a swing of his blade.
As quiet falls (except for the blaring klaxons), Grates calls out, "Let's get this done and get out of here. Let's check the rest of these doors." He heads to the door north of the turbolift cluster and opens it.
((Placing this here for convenience: The stimulants are used as a part of the Treat Injury skill’s first aid application, and each dose used allows the recipient to receive first aid one additional time per day. However, when a stimulant is used, the recipient moves –1 persistent step on the condition track, and the persistent condition can be removed only by resting for 8 hours. The stimulants allow for additional healing, but they put a great deal of strain on the body when active. One dose should wake the Jedi up nicely.
Moda: Though I wrote that as a miss, Sajin took 6 points of damage.
Anandi and Ariq still can reach the east door if they want, and opening the door will be a swift action if it's unlocked. So...we're still in mid-round.))

Jason quickly scanned the unbound patient, making sure he didn't have anything in him that'll kill. *Too bad Anandi or Artreth didn't stay to help*, he thought as he gazed at the medi-sensor. *I could definetely use it.*

Artreth smiles, glad to have finally been able to return to battle, however long it may have lasted. Heading Grates' advice, he makes his way to another of the closed doors, keeping his lightsaber ready, just in case. He looks over at Sajin and jerks his head toward the door, saying, "Watch my back?" Without waiting for a response, he turns back to the door and tries to open it.

((Hey, nobody panic. It's all good. What can I say, you know Grates is an aggressive guy.))
Grates and Ariq peer through the door into darkness for a moment, then realize that the room is a simple storeroom with a few standard shipping crates. Grates swears quietly, looks east up the corridor to the next door, and says, "Let's take that one. Good with you?"
Anandi, Sajin and Artreth arrive at the east door. Artreth tries the door and finds it locked.
In the medical bay, Jason finishes his scan. The only substance he finds in Kon-El's system is the powerful sedative that is keeping him in a twilight sleep. He injects the stimulant, and Kon-Elgasps sharply and sits bolt upright. As he does, Jason is already moving to the droid. He's not sure, but it appears that it could be repaired.
((Also, Saronian, the scan showed full hp and the top of the CT. Kon-El, the effects of the stimulant will knock you one step down the CT until you get 8 hours of rest.))

Jason glanced over at Kon-El bolting up right, raising a hand to slow him down. "Easy, man," Jason said, trying to keep him still a little. "I don't know what those stims will do to you, but you should take it easy for a minute." Jason looked back at the droid, figuring it could be repaired enough once they get some where safe. *After all, it's better to get some slightly used equipment than something new.*
Quickly, Jason grabbed the head and an arm, dragging the droid over to the medical supplies. Glancing over at the new guy, Jason tipped his head to the medical gear.
"My name is Jason. My buddies are outside trying to take on this base and quite a few of them are injured. I request your help in getting this gear and the droid out into somewhere more open before they get some bad injuries."

Ariq took a second to check inside before heading over with Grates, his blaster out and ready to blast anyone that comes up.

"Let me sense if there's any one in there, Grates.," trying to persuade the merc to hold for a second. "We already lost the element of surprise, so it would do better for us to know how many are in this room."
Slowly, Ariq stretched his senses out, trying to feel through the Force the minds of those in the next room, if there is any.

"I am Jedi Commander Kon-EL Hiraguun," Kon-EL said as he looked around the room. "Of the Grand Army of the Republic.
