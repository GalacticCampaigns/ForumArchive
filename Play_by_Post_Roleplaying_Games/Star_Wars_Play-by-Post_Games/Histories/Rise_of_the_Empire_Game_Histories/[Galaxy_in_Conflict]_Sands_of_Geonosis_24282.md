# [Galaxy in Conflict] Sands of Geonosis

### **Tempeste** (2009-07-10 08:40:01)

"The Gargantuan, one of the finest ships in our entire fleet, I assure you," Proudly states the apparent captain of the vessel, indicated by his pressed grey suit and well polished footwear. Stood opposite is the man who invited you here, Commander sturn, supposed hero of the republic back in the day. He nods at each of you before taking a seat around the metallic polished table which looks out onto the panoramic view of hyperspace. "Please take a seat, I'm sure you wish to know why I invited you here. You should know thaat we're about to go to war, those bloody seperatists have gone too far so we're going to finish them before they ruin the republic. That's somewhat irrelevant though, the clones can deal with that you see," he continues after motioning to the two armour clad guards stood at the door.
"We believe that the seperatists have an item of ancient origin down on the surface, far from the planned major battles, but you will be dropped into a hotzone." The commander pushes a flush button on the tables surface and a 3d holographic image of the dropzone appears above it. It shows a large facility, mostly underground on the southern hemisphere of the planet. It's surroundings are somewhat open with spires seemingly randomly assorted throughout the area. "
"We need you to get in there and retrieve the artifact, we don't have any intel on the device. But if the seperatists want it then it must be important, once you've picked it up, call for extraction. You'll be inserted via a an airial drop, we have single use jetpacks that can get you down safely. Don't worry about using them though, you'll be going down in tandem with another team who'll provide support and help you once on the ground, they've already been briefed. Any questions?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Amazing aren't they," remarks Lieutenant Varrus whilst observing the marching drills of Green Company, rows upon rows of the men suddenly stop on the spot, in perfect unison and with immaculate white armour. "The commander just sent through our orders, we're to assault a facility on the south of the planet, full readouts will be given when we hit the ground, everything's been a bit rushed. The men are ready to fight sir, but maybe you should ggive them some encouragement, a few words to boost morale?" Finished Varrus, glancing back at CL-01/134 before turning to watch the clones continue.

Bart nodded as he looked around at the group assembled with him. He'd been in hot-zones before, so this would be nothing different. Didn't mean that he liked them, but it was needed. Looking up at the captain, Bart opened his mouth to speak.
"Actually, sir, I do have a question. How many are on the other team? I would like to make sure that I've got enough medical supplies to treat everyone, just in case."
Doing a quick count in his head, Bart knew that he had two medpacs integrated into his armor for quick use, one stashed in his utility belt for easy access, and six more stashed in his medical kit that he carried everywhere, to act as back up. That meant he had nine medpacs. Looking around the table, he realized that there were a number of beings at the table. To then have to care for the medical needs of a second team? That might strain his resources a bit. Unless, of course, the others also had enough sense to carry medpacs so that he could treat them. That might change things.
Bart began to feel a little bit better.

'I have three medpacs with me,' remarks a tall red-skinned Twi'lek male standing by one of the briefing room's walls, his voice deep and calming.
'Should they be needed,' he adds.
The Twi'lek wears a black sleeveless shirt and baggy trousers of the same shade, the bottom of their legs tucked into his boots. His shoulders and arms are covered by a garment of fine mesh, hooked at the nape of his neck. This seems to be his primary concession to fashion. He is surprisingly handsome for a Twi'lek male. But then, he has already defied the standards of his race with the rare Lethan mutation, so why should he not also be a genetic freak in terms of good looks?
He steps forward, leaning in to take a closer look at the holographic map. The two bandoliers across his chest and the great blade sheathed at his back shift as he does so, and without looking away from the image he steadies the sword with one hand.
'Is there any intel on the inside of the facility, commander,' he asks, 'or are we going in as blind to that as we are to the true nature of the objective?'

"The other team is the same size as yours, 4 men in total. But you don't need to worry about them. Once you hit the ground you'll split up, they'll be in contact through the comm-channels though. We'll locate the target quicker if we have two teams on the ground." The Commander turned to face the Twi-lek and replied, "Sorry, we have no intel on the inside of the facility, you may be able to find a map if you slice a terminal once inside." He stops and surveys the small team before him, "There will be clone troopers in the area, but this mission is secret, they won't know you're there. I suggest you try and keep yourselves hidden for as long as possible."

Vanarra sat at the table with her hands folded neatly in her lap, listening quietly to the debriefing as it was being given. The woman's weapons were mild, even sparse compared to some in the room, but she was still confident in her abilities in a fight if needed. The Rutian twi'lek allowed her head to list to the side slowly, delicately as she listened to the conversation unfolding, her indigo eyes sliding over to the Lethan twi'lek who had just addressed the captain, an eyebrow arching upwards curiously. Lekku twitched of their own accord, not trying to send a message, simply being curious and swaying back and forth with her mood, despite her cool and calm stillness in her seat.
Finally the woman allowed her gaze to fall across the rest of those gathered, bowing her head in a nod to those whose eyes she met, slightly deeper to those whom she knew, before returning her attention to the captain. Strategic planning was not her specialty, so the female twi'lek simply remained quiet, allowing others to ask the questions that needed asking and formulate the plans. If something came to her that needed to be asked, Vanarra would do so.

The Twi'lek warrior straightens, apparently done looking at the holodisplay. Like Vannara, he takes the time to look around at those beings destined to be his comrades on the mission. He spends less time dwelling on each than she however, having already had a cursory glance while standing against the wall.
The expression he wears is a troubled one.
'Forgive me commander,' he comments after a moment, looking at the man and voicing his concern, 'but if our presence is unknown to your clone army, are we not in danger of being mistaken for separatists by them if spotted? What recourse do we have to identify ourselves if it comes to that?'

## Re: Sands of Geonosis

### **Thraken** (2009-07-10 21:20:03)

The man's comment washes over him, little in substance. The Clone Captain stands like a statue, his armour showing neither movement nor human features.
"The commander just sent through our orders, we're to assault a facility on the south of the planet, full readouts will be given when we hit the ground..."
*Assault. No specifics. No Intel. Useless.*
"...The men are ready to fight sir, but maybe you should give them some encouragement, a few words to boost morale?"
*We are ready to fight. This is what we were born to do. What else do they need?* CL-01/134 stares into the back of the man's head. This person that he doesn't know. Moments after the Officer finishes talking the clone steps forward to address the Company. His fellow clones, like thousands of others also heading for war.
"The Republic is under threat and we are summoned. All of us, Brothers, are in motion and will soon make hard contact with the enemy. Green Company's orders are to perform a base assault. You know our training. Remember your Brothers. Advance with each other. Support each other. Fight for each other. With our united strength we will defeat the enemy, bring victory and defend the Republic."

Unmoving, Naleesh uses multifaceted to observe the majority of the room: paying attention most intently to his new comrades. Two, at least from all appearances did not look like they belonged on a hunt of any kind. The third, however, a male Twi'lek, caught his eye as one possessing some measure of skill in the art of the predator. This one seemed the only worthwhile opponent in the competition of enemy eliminations. But then, of course, there are the clones. No better than battle droids in his opinion; at least, not until they prove otherwise.
Patiently observing the fellow 'hunters,' if they were worthy of such a title; Naleesh waited for them to put any questions to the Commander so that he might learn what concerned them the most about the mission. How many others? Naleesh wasn't even sure why another team needed to be sent. The only thing they would do is slow the group down or betray their position. Deep in enemy territory, the fewer hunters there were, the better. Ah, knowledge of the area; always a key component during any hunt. Yes, this one knows what is of real importance in such a situation. However, Naleesh had been deceived before by such as he. The Rodian had to stifle a chuckle when he heard the second question: wondering what would happen if they were spotted, by allies no less? They wouldn't be, if Naleesh was doing his job. Being able to know the whereabouts of both enemy and ally without being seen; that is what *he* could do.
Geonosis was a world he had never before scouted personally; but he was familiar with some of its dangers, including the native species. "As you mentioned, there is limited knowledge about the area and only a vague description of what it is we are looking for. But I was wondering if you knew anything about the separatist forces we might encounter in this subterranean foray?" Naleesh said, gesturing to the Commander.

### **Tempeste** (2009-07-11 05:45:40)

The Commander eyed the Twi-lek somewhat curiously as he asked his question, "If you work fast enough, they will not be aware of your presence. I hope you understand the lack of preperation we have in this situation, i'm afraid you'll have to use your initiative once on the ground. That said, i'll get any of your comm-links tweaked to allow you to listen to all republic channels, though you'll only be able to report back to me." He then responded to the Rodian rubbing his hands together whilst speaking, clearly anxious, "It's likely you'll face only droid opposition., And any of you that have dealth with B1's in the past know they're no threat in small numbers. The facility likely has a commander of some sort, and they may have a more experienced bodyguard or two, but killing them isn't your objective remember."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The clones look on as CL-01/134 gives his short speech, they cheer a little as he finished but clearly they aren't terribly inspired. Varrus turns to face the Captain, "I'll be leading First Platoon, second and third will be under Lt 68 and 330 respectively whilst Fourth platoon will be commanded by Sergeant 223, command says we'll have some limited support available. There's a biker unit ready, and a Walker squadron, though we can only take one. Or we could just leave them for Red company, they'll be fighting east of our position, assaulting a droid core ship. They may need the help more than us Sir."

'That will do, commander,' the Tw'lek says and offers him a nod of acknowledgement.
'My final query I will put not just to you but to all the people in this room,' he adds, surveying his teammates and spreading his arms slightly in a gesture of encompassment.
'I would like to know exactly what resources we have to complete the mission. I would like to know what skills we each bring. In short, introductions and a brief summary of talents.'
The warrior pauses as his eyes pass over Bart, already self-confessed as a medic.
'And available equipment,' he adds with a smile of acknowledgment.
'I will start. I am Kar. I trained as a soldier at the academy on Carida, and have worked for years as a bodyguard. I am, in short, a warrior. My reflexes and my senses are good, and I will consider it my first responsibility to keep my comrades safe. On that note my skill as a medic is adequate, but I would venture not as expansive as that of my new colleague. I bring only medpacs and a field kit with me, unless we are to receive additional inventory for the mission. Those and my weapon,' Kar reaches to his shoulder and taps the hilt of his sword, 'which will serve me well whether in melee or at ranged.'
The Twi'lek now lapses into silence, apparently exhausted of the inclination to speak. He looks expectant, however, presumably waiting for their responses.

Wondering what was disturbing the Commander as he answered his previous question, Naleesh turns to give his full attention to Kar. Waiting for the Twi'lek to finish Naleesh gives him a slight nod before beginning himself.
"I see I was not mistaken about you; perhaps not a hunter, but an able fighter nonetheless. As for myself, my name has little importance to those not of my world; but I do recognize the need for a team of hunters to communicate effectively. I am Naleesh. I have tracked my prey throughout every region of the known Galaxy. I rarely wish to be seen while on the hunt and take down my targets before they even realize their danger," the Rodian smiled as he remembered a previous kill. "As for my loadout: I operate to maximize my hunting efficiency as I am often traveling a planet's wilderness for up to weeks at a time. Apart from my weapons and armor, I carry only enough ammunition to destroy an entire garrison." Naleesh concludes his exposition by leaning back in his seat, a semblance of a smile on his face.

Bart nodded at Kar for his comments and listened carefully to Naleesh describe himself.
*I've got my hands full on this mission.*
Realizing that there was a break in the speech, Bart nodded towards the others and introduced himself.
"Name's Bart Fjord." Anyone who'd read some holonews or another would be familiar with the Fjord name. They were speeder makers and designers, and fairly well known for being rich. (DC 10 Galactic Lore Check)
"I graduated from the Coruscant Medical University a year ago or so, and volunteered when the war broke out. I'll not make any claims at being a great warrior or hunter, because that's not me. I'm a field medic and a fairly skilled surgeon, or so they tell me. I have completed basic training and am proficient with a blaster pistol and how to move about in basic armor, which I prefer. I also know my way around a kit and how to install it into armor as well. I mostly carry around enough materials to make sure that the team survives whatever it runs into. I guess you could say that my job is to make sure that everyone comes back alive, if not in complete health also."

(OOC: Since 'Varrus' is supposed to be a clone I will assume so from this point on. He will be the newcomer to the company that Cloney thinks is wierd and doesn't much like.)
The Captain looks back at the Lieutenant. Equipment well strapped to his clean armour.
"We have no idea what we're being dropped into. Have we any information as to how we are being inserted?"
Taking a few steps past the lieutenant he continues.
"We'll take the speeders for mobility, Red can have the walkers."

### **Tempeste** (2009-07-11 15:19:46)

"Very well sir," Replies the Lieutenant, who then waves over a nearby trooper, who he quickly sends off on an errand, "For insertion sir, we'll be dropped in via Laat/i gunship a few clicks south, intel thinks there may be Anti/air emplacements and won't risk losing us in transit, we may be able to get more fire support if we take those batteries out though. I know intel is pretty useless right now, but we should have more detailed maps once we're planetside."
-------------------------------------------------
The Commander listens intently as the group speaks, opening his mouth as the Twi-lek speaks, "Ah equipment, i'm sorry but this war is about to get nasty, we can't offer you any help other than insertion and extraction. I know it's not ideal, but you're team is unkown to official channels, we can't give you that kind of support right now. Alot of supplies are tied up being supplied to the different Company's as well, we'd find it hard to redirect anything, sorry."

Inhaling sharply, Naleesh's twin antennae twitched with anticipation. "Let us debark immediately; the thrill of the hunt runs fully through my veins and I've nearly caught the scent of the prey awaiting our arrival on this dustball of a planet."
His sucker-tipped fingers ran over the length of the large rifle resting in his lap, the contact reassuring him that his single reason for living was near at hand.

Tourquise lekku twitch, more meaningfully now, as Vanarra's eyes slide over the group, allowing each to introduce themselves in turn. Finally, she bows her head respectfully and lifts it as she returns her gaze to Kar.
Lekku Speech:
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

*I have also been trained by the Kivas. I know many things from them, I do not wish the others to know. Things that will be of use. Trust me, Kar of the Lethan. Please.*

</details>

"I was born Vannar'alynyr. Vannara is appropriate. I have not always lived on Ryloth. I was sold due to clan wars to a Zabrak Prince, who made certain I excelled in more subtle combat than blaster rifles - though I am well aware of how to use one. Eventually I was ... released by the death of the Prince, of which I am saddened, for he was actually a good man, I returned to Ryloth, where I learned more in the art of warfare. I still prefer the use of a blade over a blaster, and I have always preferred negotiation and silver-tongued fair speech to combat, but I am competant." An eyebrow slowly arches upwards as Vannara tilts her chin a little more towards the ceiling in a quiet challenge to doubt her validity in being here.

Kar listens to Naleesh speak politely, but he is not skilled enough in the diplomatic arts to keep a trace of concern over the Rodian's exuberance for killing from his face.
The warrior is glad of an excuse to turn his attention elsewhere when Vannara speaks. He watches his fellow Twi'lek closely, more intently than he had previously looked at any of the others. Anyone not familiar with the Twi'lek practice to communicate with lekku and not just words may read false meaning into this unusual level of attention.
As Vannara's lekku stop moving even as she continues to speak aloud, his own twitch and writhe in silent reply.

Bart noticed the male and female Twi'leks paying each other a lot of attention.
*Figures. The girls out here on the front just don't go for the medics, Bart. You've got to realize this. We're like the best friend that gets called up when she gets dumped. We're never seen that way.*
Sighing to himself, Bart turned away from the Twi'lek that had caught his attention, as it was obvious now that her own attention was caught by someone else.
*Well, that is why I decided to never show anyone my credit line. If a girl's ever going to fall for me, it's going to be because she can see the real me.*
Bart began to wonder whether or not the meeting was over. He knew his job. It was the same no matter the mission. Keep everyone alive.

Indigo eyes slipped back to Kar as the warrior stood stoicly in the meeting. Indeed, one might think more was there than there was. Particularly, Vannara's eyes watched the drifting and swaying lekku of the twi'lek warrior, before she glanced around the rest of the room. Even as the turquoise woman's eyes started wander, Vannara's own lekku began to twitch and writhe in answer to the red-skinned male.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I felt a calling away from our home, Sesk'vati. replied Vannara, not answering Kar's question directly. I have trained in the temple. I have been adopted by the Sesk'mahvus. But yes, I have trained with the Sesk'nabsilai.

*Well. I have a bad feeling about this coming Battle of Geonosis.* He decides that the Lieutenant really has nothing more to offer right now.
"Very Well." He turns to the men he has trained with for years, taken lead of ever since the last Captain went down.
"At ease men. Prepare to stack up for LAAT/i insertion on reversion from hyperspace." He slowly makes his way through his company, now all moving to sit in neat groups by squad mate and platoon.

Kar lets his lekku fall still without explaining his curious statement of pride in being acknowledged as a member of one of the lower castes. He even looks aside, as though by avoiding Vannara's gaze he can ensure the communications blackout he desires.

The commander watches you for a few moments, when suddenly an alarm klaxon begins to ring. "We've exited back into realspace, please head to hangar A3 where you'll find the other team. The ship that you'll be jumping from should be there," The commander scans you once more before adding, "Good luck." An aide appears who leads your group to the hangar bay. Thick durasteel doors open to reveal a large room containing a single Laat/i gunship and a small group of black wearing individuals. One of them waves you over, on close inspection she's a female cerean. Some other members of the group don't seem too happy to see you however, including a gruff Trandoshan who's tightly gripping a grenade launcher. They're all wearing black jumpsuits and a few have goggles already one, the cerean then speaks.
"Hey, i'll try and keep this simple, each of you gets a partner for the drop. The drop itself doesn't need any effort from you, just tyr and enjoy the view as you hurtle towards a dusty battleground of death ok," she almost laughs but receives a less than friendly stare from the trandoshan. "Aww lighten up Drox!" she protests whilst trying to hold back a smile, "You should get a pair of goggles from the table," she says before pointing to a small metal tray on a table near the gunship.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The same klaxon is heard in the Assembly hall but CL-01/134 knows it's meaning from drills. The lieutenant salutes before leaving to prepare his men for the landing, the other lieutenants do the same. An aide informs CL-01/134 that he's to drop in with his personal staff, troopers who help direct those beneath him during battle. The aide then leads CL-01/134 to his transport, they'll be dropping in soon.

'Heights, huh?' Kar comments wryly, rewarding the Cerean's good humour with a smile, 'never liked them. The "dusty battleground of death" is closer to my comfort zone.'
He takes a pair of the goggles and straps them firmly around his head, though for now he keeps them off his eyes, choosing instead to rest them on his forehead. After securing his own, he offers to help any of his teammates who have still not done so.

Carefully lowering the goggles over his forehead so as not to disturb his sensitive antennae, Naleesh sets the protective lenses over his slightly bulbous eyes and forms a tight seal. He knows that if he allowed his eyes to be exposed to such an experience, there would be no end to the irritation while trying to line up targets in the field.
He examined the ships that were to bring them into the atmosphere. Naleesh liked what he saw; they appeared sturdy enough to his eye and were bristling with various types of weaponry. A silent nod toward the Cerean indicates he is ready for the plunge.

Bart nodded towards the Cerean as they entered. At the mention of goggles, he holds up his modified helmet and pats it before putting the helmet on and sealing it up.
*Well, at least we'll have a view before we die.*
Switching over to the outer frequency, "So, are we jumping with partners, or what?"

## Re: Sands of Geonosis

### **Tempeste** (2009-07-14 15:54:43)

The cerean smiles and responds to the medic, "Yes, you get to go with me! My name is Jain by the way" She then checks a small piece of flimsiplast with notes on it, "You can go with Drox here," announces Jain whilst pointing at Kar. As she finishes one of the previously un-introduced members of her group step forward. He's a dark skinned Zabrak holding a stripped down slugthrower with a telescopic sight. He attempts to smile but stops halfway.
"Uku is with the Rodian," she continues, "And you get Vakri," she finishes, looking at Vannara. It seems vakri is the so far silent Togrutan who up until now has been inspecting the Gunship, he finally turns around and nods as his name is mentioned, quickly getting back to checking the transport.

### **chibiamy** (2009-07-14 16:03:07)

A single hand is lifted, waving off any help with her gear as Vannara, perhaps stubbornly, or perhaps simply wanting to learn it for herself. The woman adjusts her gear, and then slides the goggles down over her features, fingers playing with them a bit as she gets used to them. An eyebrow arches curiously as she glances around, the movements of her eyes nearly hidden by the goggles as she does so. Slowly the woman considers, before moving over to Jain, bowing her head in a nod as her partner is announced.
A glance is given to the rest of her team-mates, her lekku swaying back and forth, before she turns on her heel and walks to follow Vakri. Obviously the Togrutan is busy with what he feels is necessary, and therefore, Vannara does not initially interrupt him, instead studying his own study of the gunship, hands clasped neatly before her as she moves behind. There is a method to Vannara's apparent quiet, as the woman would rather study others, and get a feel for them, before irrevocable harm is done.
When Vakri appears to be done with his inspection, the twi'lek bows her head to the man. "I was told I am your partner, Vakri. I am Vannara. How is it you want to do this?" she asks, sliding into a more self-assured posture, one leg slightly bend, her hips tilted at an angle and one hand resting on a hip. "I am not here to intentionally make your job any more difficult than it already is. So lead me through what you expect of this and of me."

Whilst checking up on his men CL-01/134 goes over his equipment. There's not much at all in actuality. Like all his fellow clones he possesses the standard equipment belt. *All present and secured.* With the exception of a single hard electrobinocular case. As he moves past the second platoon he opens it and checks the optics - one handed - before returning it to its case and sealing it. *Maybe they should issue slings or something.*
He begins checking his rifle - a full size DC-15A. *Some units got stuck with the shorties. Hate to be one of them.* Done checking he loads the rifle and continues on to the fourth platoon when the klaxon sounds. The Captain yells as all his men are already getting up and the Lieutenant runs for first platoon.
"That's it! stack up and on your transports! move! move!" Jogging forwards he meets up with his command squad and boards a LAAT/i.
"I want the surface data as soon as it comes in." He looks away from his staff boarding the transport and grabs one of the crew handles in the ceiling. They wait for launch...

Bart looks at the Twi'lek moves sensually (at least to him) towards her partner, grateful that the helmet prevents anyone from seeing where his eyes go. He's also grateful to be in armor period. Shaking himself out of his reverie, he walks over towards the Cerean and offers his hand to her.
"Bart Fjord. Nice to meet you. What can I do to make this as smooth and death-free as possible?"

The Laat/i's doors shut with a smooth click and the Gargantuan begins to drop into a low orbit above the planet. After a few tense minutes the gunship drops from the larger vessel and begins to plummet towards the dropzone. The pilot eases the ship out of an unexpected nose dive and begins to approach the target area. The doors now slide open to grant a panoramic view of the area, already the battle seems to be in full swing as dropships are shot out of the sky, sleek geonosian fighters slinking into the distance. The ship banks around a spiralling geonosian hive and begins to descend to ground level. "This is your drop zone sir!" announces the pilot. One of the aides throws down a nearby coil of synthrope, quickly taking hold and sliding down to the ground.
The dropzone itself is a small flat ditch which seems mostly protected from the desert winds, in the distance you can see a large bunker, it must be the target. In between the Bunker and your position however you notice several AA batteries located on rises in the landscape. Men drop onto the ground around you and begin to secure the area, there aren't any droids in the immediate area, but you get the feeling they'll show up soon.
----------------------------------------
Vakri turns to face his partner after a few moments, looking her up and down before speaking after a moments pause. "Well uh, we use this harness right?" He says whilst signalling to a somewhat complex harness which is already attached to his outfit, "You fit in, right in front of me, then you just get to hold still whilst I control the err.. Jet pack."
The Cerean is still smiling as she holds out the harness, "You jump in here and then I'll do everything else. Just make sure those goggles are on tight, you don't want your eyes cut to shreds from airbourne dust now!"
Anyone paying attention through the Hangar doors notices the ship dropping into low orbit, though it isn't being targeted by any enemy gunfire yet.
"We should get ready to go," states Jain whilst jumping into the Laat/i, we can harness up inside here."

The Twi'lek warrior approaches Drox. He is tall and broad enough that the Trandoshan doesn't exactly loom over him, but the difference in size is still quite notable.
'I'm Kar, Drox,' he says, forgoing the usual niceties on the assumption that his assigned drop partner probably isn't the type to appreciate them, 'I'll be in your hands out there.'
He seems perfectly confident that those hands are good ones to be in. When Jain speaks, he moves to board the transport.

Taking measured steps, Naleesh approaches and squares off with his assigned landing partner. "Uku is it?" The Rodian continues speaking without waiting for a response "I've got a lot riding on this mission, a bit of personal revenge if you take my meaning, and if you jeopardize it in any way I will have a new primary target. You get me?" he concludes pointing with a threatening finger.
He turns and lightly hops into the awaiting dropship. "You coming or are we going to sit here and let the droids smash themselves?"

Stepping into the harness that was pointed out to him, Bart made sure his straps were good and tight and checked his helmet seals one last time. Turning his head slightly to the side, a voice pipes out through the helmet's vocabulator. Even through the helmet, the nervousness can be heard.
"So, does this closeness make this jump our first date?"

As the twi'lek female's eyes look over the harness a smile forms at the corners of her lips. "Well then, Vakri, I am in your capable hands," she offers calmly, and even with a little bit of jesting warmth. For the next few moments, Vannara takes the opprotunity to have Vakri assist her into the harness, before the straps are tightened properly, and the woman's head tilts to the side. "Hmmm, I should have wrapped my lekku protectively for this," she notes, before giving an absent nod to herself - acknowledging the oversight, then dismissing it to the past. A twist of her head and Vannara almost manages to look up at Vakri over her shoulder, "I believe I am ready, now. Thank you," she notes, before allowing her eyes one last glance over the group. "May the Force be with us," she intones, even as her turquoise lekku twitch again.

Naleesh waited, none to patiently, for his jump partner to join him inside the LAAT/i's open underbelly. When the Zabrak finally steps into the bay, the Rodian initiates the process of strapping himself to Uku, carefully and silently following the steps he had observed from the other members of the group.
*Putting oneself completely within the hands of another being, especially one yet to be proven in the field. Just another way of saying 'Deathtrap.'* He thought as a sigh of resignation passed his lips.

As his men hit the ground around him the captain surges forward and activates his comlink.

Reaching a clear area he plants the stock of his rifle in the ground while he observes the enemy positions with his electrobinoculars.

Drox grunts when he's adressed by the twi-lek and simply motions towards the gunship, following his partner before strapping up inside. He pulls the harness tight, maybe too tight for comfort, he then straps his grenade launcher tightly to his side.
Naleesh is ignored as the zabrak finishes checking the environmental seals on his weapon, "It's dusty down there, I don't want the chamber getting clogged," he remarks after he's finished. As they're strapped together Uku follows a similar set of actions to Drox, securing his rifle before gripping tight to the rail above his head.
Jain nods as her partner speaks, "Maybe, if you survive, maybe you can get me a drink some time," she jokes before taking her place in the rapidly filling transport hold. Vakri remans silent as the gunship's doors close, quietly repeating Vannara's last words to himself.
It's only a few moments before the engines fire up and the gunship has left the cold embrace of the Gargantuan's hangar bay. The Larty has a smooth flight, the pilot's doing a good job to avoid incoming fire, but there's an eerie silence, broken only by the humming of the oversized engines. A moment of serenity is broken as the doors slide open and reveal the hostile surface of Geonosis. Dusty winds howl through the transport and cause it to rock slightly, almost knocking anyone who isn't holding tight off balance. The gunship is still flying high, a small red light ready to indicate when the drop zone is below.
----------------------------------------------------------------
The AA guns are organised in two batteries, each containing 3 or 4 anti air guns, the first battery is about 500metres to the northwest whilst the second is slightly further to the northeast. The captain's subordinates radio in their confirmations of landing, there aren't any reports of fighting yet though. The Biker unit has formed up in the centre of the company.

Seeing the rushing landscape below, Bart has to take a second to catch his breath, and retrieve his stomach from its fallen position around his boots. He feels a gag reflex building up, but does his best to squelch it.
*I hate jumping. I hate jumping. I HATE JUMPING! **I HATE JUMPING!***
Keeping his eyes closed, he turns his head backwards towards his partner, since being strapped in he can't turn completely around.
"Just tell me what to do and when to jump!"

Kar looks out at the sandy rocks rushing below. He laughs, thoughts clouded with self-derision. He didn't lie, he really does dislike hights. It isn't bad enough to be a fear, and he is perfectly comfortable above a planet's atmosphere, within a starship hanging freely among the stars. It's really gravity he doesn't like, and the possibility of a fall.
And now he's about to willingly jump with a trandoshan strapped to his back. Kar continues to chuckle at the absurdity of his situation, using the humour inherent to it as a means of diffusing his tension.

Squinting at the blurring images of rocks, dust, and spires that make up the Geonosian terrain below, Naleesh attempts to make out any sign of droid formations or movements of any kind. He silently wished he could have been in one of the gunnery emplacements; those probably have exquisite computer-assisted targeting and magnification systems, enabling someone to kill droids by the dozens.
Reaching back, Naleesh tries to rub one of the horns on Uku's head for some luck. He usually wasn't a superstitious being; but it couldn't hurt when his life wasn't in his own hands.

A slow exhale, and Vanarra reaches back to brush a comforting hand across Vakri's arm. Eyes close as the woman finds her center, and then she opens them, ready for the jump, the long relatively peaceful glide down, and then the sudden inevitable meeting of solid matter to solid matter once again. The Twi'lek woman says nothing, her indigo eyes sliding over the rest of the group, as if making certain they are ready, before her lips move in a silent prayer to her Goddess.

Observing the two Anti Air positions the Captain quickly decides on his plan of attack. He speaks into the company channel again.
"Platoons one, two, three prepare to advance on the Northwest position. One will lead and flank left, two will hang back to attack in sync with one, three will support from the right and stay aware. I want to put them under 120 degrees of crossfire. This is open ground, spread out and be ready to cover and advance when they start firing. Get to it."
He moves back to the ditch position before continuing.
"Fourth platoon dig in the defilade, you'll be supporting when needed. Bikers, keep loose and mobile around our position. You'll be playing cavalry. Stay aware for hostiles."
Going prone at the top of the ditch he rests his rifle next to him whilst pulling out his electrobinoculars to continue surveying the battlefield.

The pilot shouts to indicate the red light which was now illuminated, "The Drop zone is below, Jump!" The four operatives immediately follow the advice and they each leap from the gunship. The harsh desert air buffets the jumpers as they descend upon their target at high speed. The objects below constantly grow in size until a small facility can be made out. Some might also notice that startling presence of a number of Anti-aircraft guns, they don't seem to be alerted though and are inactive right now. As the ground approaches the Compound becomes more clear, it's surrounded by a wall and consists of 3 or 4 buildings, one of which is a large tower, complete with a landing platform, the other is what looks like a large warehouse. The other buildings are smaller, probably private quarters.
A sudden gust of wind rocks Drox, knocking him to the side slightly as they descend. It's only a few more moments before he's reached activation height and his fingers quickly find the jump packs thruster switch. He depresses the button and the jetpack emits a howling whine as it roars to life, slowing the descent of those attached to it. The others soon follow suit and the group lands a few hundred metres to the east of the facility. The landing isn't hard but it's not exactly soft either, everyone is quickly unfastened from each other, and the jump packs are discarded into a nearby ditch. The Cerean assembles her squad and they quickly leave towards the facility.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The platoons follow their orders and first platoon is nearly in position. The captain notices that the bunker features a large tower, and he also sees a series of objects fall through the air nearby the facility. He can't make out what they are however.

Bart grunts as he lands hard on the ground and rolls. He barely has time to register their landing as the Cerean jumps up and runs off with her group. Realizing that they were now ground side, Bart quickly runs to one side to find cover. Once there, he double checks to make sure his holo-recorder is turned on before he begins narrating the holo, his helmet preventing anyone from hearing his words.
"Here we stand on the planet of Geonosis, sight of the first major battle in the current war against the Seperatists. As you saw just a minute ago, we rocket jumped from high altitude to our current position. I hope my screams weren't too much for you to watch, Mother. As you can see now, I'm just fine. Well, it looks like we're going to get going here pretty soon, so I'll shut up and let you hear our comlinks."
Switching his helmet back over to the group's frequency, Bart drew his blaster pistol and double checked his medical kit before checking in with their leader. He then begins a quick sweep of the immediate area with his electrobinoculars.
"Medic on the ground. All the parts are still here."

Despite his fears, Kar keeps his eyes wide open in the air, surveying what can be seen of the facility from the high vantage point. He is somewhat surprised by the lack of response to their presence, though is glad for it.
Freed of the harness and the unwelcome proximity with a surly Trandoshan, he takes a moment to breathe and enjoy being on the ground once more. In that time, the Republic team begin moving, leaving he and the other contractors in the dust.
'Come,' he says, 'we are meant to be working together with them. Let's not become separated before we've even gained entry.'
Keeping low and moving from cover to cover as he finds it, the Twi'lek follows after the Cerean and her people.

Reaching out, Bart grabbed the Twi'lek's arm before he got to far.
"You forget that we're supposed to split up? Two teams looking for the same device? Maybe we should try a different entry?"
(taking 10 on Knowledge [tactics] for a total of 20 to see if we should stay together till we breach the complex, or if entry via a different point would be better so that the guards don't find both teams together and nail them both.)

Kar stops and turns to face their medic, his expression calm and patient.
'I remember, but we are two hundred or more metres from the facility. I think relying on the hope of a secret tunnel or a vent around here would be a huge waste of time. The other thing we could do if we split up is loop around to the West side, but it would take much more time circling around than it would to just follow the other team and then move around the facility's edge. I see no point splitting off from them yet. At the walls, perhaps, but not now.'
'And if we don't let them get too far ahead, we may well find we don't have to part ways until we've breached in any case,' he adds, gaze falling one by one on his teammates, 'and I hope that is the case, since no one introduced themselves as a specialist in breaking and entering and we may have problems otherwise.'
The twi'lek warrior starts moving again.
'We get no closer to achieving our objectives if we stand here talking. We can discuss our options on the move.'

With a bowing nod of gratitude to Vakri as she is separated from her jump companion, Vannara slides out of the harness. An eyebrow rises and the woman is moving instandly between Bart and Kar. "Both make good points," she notes quietly, glancing between the two men. "For now, let us move forward until we find an advantageous place to separate safely into two groups. But for now, our objective is still far enough in the distance that we need move in the same direction as it is. We must hurry, my comrades, before we are discovered. Come. Come," urges the female twi'lek, glance now to their goal, before taking one step, then two steps forward, hoping that one of the men will overtake her quickly. Vannara leading is a bad idea, and she knows it.

Observing the squat object in the distance he's surprised at the sight of an apparent tower on the thing. *What kind of bunker is this?* Movement draws his attention, but as he tracks his binoculars on the falling objects they had already fallen out of sight onto the horizon. *What the fierfek was that?*
He doesn't know what the term means. Some of the training sergeants and their commandoes said it on occasion. The Captain and a few others were known to suddenly say it on reflex. His mind grinds on the possilibities. *Not debris, too regular. Not ordinance, no explosions. No disturbance, soft landed? Supply drop?*
Not being able to discern anything simply from a fleeting glance he files it in the back of his mind as he continues to observe the battlefield.

'Leader?' Kar asks, suprised. Very surprised, it seems, enough to make him stop short.
'I'm no leader. As far as I know this is a team of equals, nobody told me anything about a chain of command. You're right anyway, we do need to split up at some point. I just don't think the time and place has come yet. I'm sure you can see my point.'
'I apologise if I have mislead you in some way,' he adds, expression now troubled.

Naleesh is slow to rise from the impact of the landing. In a crouch, he checks the condition of all his equipment, weapon first, to make sure that nothing was damaged by either the powerful jetpack or the landing. Removing the secured DLT-20A, he brought it up and peered through the scope, swinging it a full 360 degrees making sure there were no immediate threats.
He tapped his jump partner on the shoulders "Thanks for the fun trip; you should group up with the others." The Rodian brushed some of the planet's dirt onto his armored body in order to gain some natural camouflage and sprinted for the nearest piece of high ground where he would be able to claim some cover and a tactical advantage over the open terrain.
Listening to the chatter of his comrades, he waits for silence so that he might speak. "Naleesh here. I will cover the groups advance toward the compound; once there, I can make my way across the open ground while you cover me and work on finding a solution to breach the perimeter. And as for the approach; just let me know so I can cover you to the best of my ability."
Upon arriving at his chosen location, he deploys his bipod and attempts to conceal himself so that his enemies will never see his shots coming.

Indigo eyes dance across the sands before sliding over to Kar as the twi'lek catches up with her. Not slowing her stride any further, Vannara moves forward, eyes still behind the goggles using them as protecting against the sands that winds periodically whip up into the faces of those who dare walk this harsh landscape. Lekku sway back and forth behind her, not in any secret communication, but in a natural motion of their own.
"Sesk'vati," offers Vannara with a faint bow of her head as she continues to walk, the word flowing in a tone of honor rather than derision from the woman. "I hope my words earlier did not offend. That was not their intent."

'I recollect no words that I found offensive,' Kar assures her, adjusting his stride to keep pace with the shorter female, 'and I am sorry if any of my own caused you to misconstrue my feelings.'
'If you refer to your use of "Sesk'vati", then don't worry. You could have done me no greater honour. I am proud of the path I follow, though I am no less proud of the path followed by my father.'

"Then I shall think no more of them," notes Vannara as her eyes continue to watch the sands before her as she walks. "I find relief in the fact you find no offense in the title. There is honor in all manner of men," continues the woman, "especially among those who face death regularly without fear." A pause in the woman's words allows silence to fill between them, though from Vannara's stance it is certainly not uncomfortable. "If I may pry, what is the path that your father has chosen, that you imply is so very different than yours?"

"As you wish," offers Vannara as the woman gives a faint bow of her head, before her gaze turns and looks off to the right, scanning the horizon there, before she trails her gaze off to the left. An eyebrow rises gently before the woman turns to look at Kar. "What do you suggest our next move should be, Sesk'vati?" then asks the woman, her eyes looking back towards the looming fortress in the distance, narrowing as if somehow that would bring it into focus more.

Shaking his head morosely, Kar allows his lip to curl in reaction to her question.
'They *really* should have sent an officer, I never thought I'd be dealing with these sorts of questions again,' he comments dryly, following her gaze to the walls of the compound.
A stray gust whips some sand into his goggles, a small portion settling in the frame. He reaches absently to wipe the particles away.
'Once we're there we should follow Bart's suggestion,' the red twi'lek says with a nod of acknowledgment to the armoured man, 'and search in the opposite direction to the Republic's team. But we ought to maintain comms with them. If we find a way in, I think we may need their help to exploit it. Once inside, we split up officially. Well, the Force had best be with us at that point, because our team is neither a recon nor a commando unit and we aren't familiar with each other or the limits of our abilities. We'll just have to do the best we can and watch each other's backs, but I'm afraid it's very likely to become a running firefight, and probably sooner rather than later.'
'We should press on,' Kar adds, increasing his pace, 'with Naleesh on overwatch we needn't be so cautious, and we're wasting time.'

Those who move towards the facility do so apparently without being detected, they reach a wall about 8 feet tall which the previous team is preparing to climb over. "We'll search the warehouse, you'll search the tower," explains the Cerean before her portion of the team climbs the wall, partners helping one person up, before being pulled up themselves.

That said, the woman bows her head to the Republic Team, before looking up at the walls of the compound, then back to the Cerean who seems to be the groups leader. "Frequency 113.8 then?" she suggests, following along with Kar's assessment of the situation, beginning to adjust her own comm-unit, before reaching for a rope in order to get over the walls.

"Roger that First and Second." Clear and quick on the comlink, he answer while he sweeps across with his electrobinoculars.
"Third squad. Status. Are you in position to support and watch their flank?" If the company could complete the arc of fire, they would achieve maximum crossfire on the target throughout their advance whilst spreading return fire to the same degree.

'What do you see, Vannara?' he asks quietly as he waits for his turn to ascend.
