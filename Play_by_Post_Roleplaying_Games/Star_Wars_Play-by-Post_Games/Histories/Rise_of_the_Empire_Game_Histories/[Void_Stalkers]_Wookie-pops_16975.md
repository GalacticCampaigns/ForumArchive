# [Void Stalkers] Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-09-20 23:31:35)

The 0900 morning briefing comes to soon for some and not fast enough for others. The meeting room is the standard briefing room your always in a long black table with a holoprojector built into the center of the table. Captain Jax is waiting for you when you start to arrive. He is sitting next to the a large wookie looking over a data pad. The wookie is large like all wookies and has black fur that is starting to go grey at the ends.

Daxxon enters the room and notices the Wookie, he has heard of their Species but has only seen some as slaves. He takes a Seat at the table knowing he has arrived a bit earlier then the others "Well I guess some of them must have a hangover, should make them friendlier then usual today..." Daxxon grins a bit, wondering which of them will have a hangover for the day.

Biardi enters the briefing room slightly ahead of 0900. He seems bright and alert, but then again he made a point to leave early enough to get some sleep last night. After all, he wouldn't want to make a bad first impression. The Duros nods in greeting to those already present and sits down. Biardi studies a datapad of his own once seated, waiting for the meeting to start.

Jake rose from his bunk around 0700 hit the showers and then got ready for the briefing. He put his new Sub-Lt pins on his uniform grabbed his equipment and went off to the mess hall for some chow. While he didn't over do the celebrating last night he still had the feeling in his stomach that could only be satisfied with some food. Even food from the mess hall.
Chatting with some of the other snub jocks from other squadron passed the time quickly. When he looked at his chrono he noticed he had 15 minuted to get to the briefing. *Plenty of time all I need is ten and I'll be there.* Quickly picking up and saying his goodbyes he left the mess hall and walked to the meeting.
Arriving with 5 minutes to spare he noticed the Captain along with the two new guys. "Morning." he said with a smile. "How's everyone feeling?" he finished as he took his place at the table.

Biardi looks up from his data pad when Jake arrives. "Excellent, yourself?" he replies with a smile.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Yogi** (2008-09-29 00:07:42)

Jake smiled as he made himself comfortable the the chair. "Rested and ready to go." And he was. He wanted to hop in his Y-wing and take the fight to the Imps.

### **Valheru** (2008-09-29 00:42:03)

Biardi nods, "Yes I'm eager to get underway as well."

Deel got up early, putting on his uniform and gathering his gear getting ready for when he would take it to the ship. Last thing he puts on is his utility belt and his blaster. Feeling a little starnge at the new rank insignia on his uniform, something he would have to get use to.
After he left his quarters and got some furit and some juice from the mess hall he heads to the briefing room. Checking the updates on the Voidstalker and the Y-wing that they used. The ship was ready to go finially. As he enters the briefroom he sees that Jake was there allready as was the new medic that had joined them. "Capt. do you have anything back from the data we collected from the fighters we incountered?" Deel takes a seat and sets down his furit juice and data pad, taking another bite of his furit, he waits for the Captains reply.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-09-29 02:28:08)

Jax smiles at Deel.
"The squints are running over the data now. We sould hhave something by the time we get back. Try and keep your mind on our current mission and not some new starfighter. I know how you love your new toys and scematics."
He looks over the room
"Where is evryone I know I told the 0900."

Antur rolls into the meeting at 0906 a little late he did his best. Tired he does his best to look presentable, man this shirt is tight did in shrink in the wash? Antur try`s to straighten out any wrinkles in his garb while he enters the room standing at attention. Flushed red with a little embarrassment Antur realizes why his shirt is so tight ..... its not his. Antur salutes but makes every attempt not to make eye contact with Jax, zipping up his jump suit as best he can over Arty`s shirt. Man I hope that's all I am wearing of hers.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Yogi** (2008-09-29 08:04:28)

From Jake's vantage point he could see the door and all who entered. He wasn't expecting Antur to show up. Jake barely noticed that his friend seems a little rushed as Antur was hiding it well. What caught his attention was his fidgeting. Jake raised an eyebrow at his wingman. *Looks like someone didn't get a lot of sleep last night.* He thought as he gave a slight smirk.

The Rodian runs into the room catching his breath. The look on his face was worried, this was embarassing after a promotion he still couldn't make the meetings on time, but at least he wasn't the last one to make it to the meeting. As Meeto looks around his worried face cheers up as he realizes he isn't as late as he thought. He tries to brush off his uniform and play it as if he is on time. He finds a seat that will allow him to use his portable computer. He glances at Jax trying to avoid his commanding disaproval glare. Opening the portable computer Meeto actually looks like he is ready to take notes, closer examination would reveal is working on some sort of binary code.
'Morning Everyone.' His greetings was curt not to draw anymore attention to himself he tries to change the subject, 'Where is Arty?'
Anyone looking at the computer screen with Use Computer will recognize what is there.
[hide]The screen is filled with binary droid sub-routines and code.[/hide]

### **ganthet** (2008-09-29 10:50:11)

"Sorry sir. The ships are ready to go when ever we need them." Deel feeling alittle imberused at his interest in the new fighters. The was right though he needed to keep his mind on the job at hand. Deel sees Antur and Meeto come in to the briefing room both seem to be in a rush. He looks at the computer that Meeto has and quickly figures out what he was working on. Looking at his Rodain friend. "Did you stay up again working on the programing for that driod your working on?"
Deel smiles he had a droid idea of his own he wanted to work on but he had little time to mess around with it. Maybe this mission he would see some free time, who knows. Drinking some furit juice and eating somemore of his furit he quitely waits for the breifing to start.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-09-29 12:02:03)

Arty runs to the breifing room right behind Antur, skidding to a stop to miss the door and fall just past it. She however gets back up again and moves into the room, blushing as she runs a hand through her hair and tugs at her jumpsuit. Her shirt kept getting caught, but in her rush she couldn't find her usual one and just picked up one she found on the floor. After much fiddling she finally got it zipped, and does so quickly after seeing -why- the shirt was so big on her. She coughs and tries to avoid eye contact while grapping Anturs hand and moving to the chairs beside the Captin, she had a tradition to follow; as she sits she mumbles a soft "Sorry."

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-29 15:16:39)

The Gungan stumbles in late. If anyone looks at him he just shrugs innocently.
"Hello boyos! What seem to bein the spakeing going on in dere?" He quickly finds a seat to see what is going on.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-09-29 15:27:53)

Jax looks at the Gungan then at Arty.
"What the hell is he doing here? This is a military briefing not a dinner show."

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-29 15:36:51)

The Gungan responds to Jax, he seems to get perky as his eye stalks go up.
"Dinner? Wheres is it bein? Here?" He replies with his long tongue hanging out the side.

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-29 15:40:59)

"Think of him as the team mascot Jax.." Daxxon says jokingly "...besides he swore a Life Debt to Arty so you aren't getting rid of him anytime soon." Daxxon looks at the Gungan then back at Deel "You could always rename the ship the Dancing Gungan...it will strike fear in someone I'm sure..." Daxxon now being a bit sarcastic, well more then a bit, but he looks back at Jax "I doubt he is a spy, so I would just ignore him and get on with the briefing so we can get the mission done asap." Daxxon leans back in his chair and with his hand rubbing his goatee

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-29 15:47:16)

The Gungan nods to Daxxon. "What he's sayin be de truth! Now mesa be ready for munchen."
Mar San shoots his tongue out at Jax and raspberries him.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-09-29 15:55:30)

The Wookie roars something to Jax. Jax looks at him then at the gungan.
"Yea I know you respect life debts but at least wookies are useful in a fight, whats he gonna do make the imps laugh themselves to death. Arty he is your responsibility maybe he will be useful and take a shot meant for you this time."
Jax looks at his chronometer.
"Where the hell is Revv?"

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Valheru** (2008-09-29 16:17:58)

Biardi barely notices when Arty and Antur enter, he expected them to be a little late, but he is surprised to see the gungan. Before he can say anything though Jax pretty much sums it up, even if it was a little harsher than Biardi would have phrased it. Since the Commander looks frustrated by the delay Biardi makes a suggestion, â€œPerhaps we should start the briefing without him, Sir. I could catch him up on the details later.â€

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-09-29 16:25:44)

Arty chuckles softly, patting the Captins arm "aww come on, you know how much I wanted a pet, and looks he's a nice guy! he makes tension in a room go away!" She chuckles again, her free hand moving to rest on Antur's leg.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-09-29 16:42:14)

Jax glares at the gungan for a moment then sits down.
"Fine lets begin. Its no secret that the imps are using Wookies as slaves but they are also allowing Transdoshians to export any slaves they catch to anyone willing to pay the price and the imps just take a cut."
The black wookie roars and pounds his hands on the table.
"Darraatoo here is a leader of the resistance fighters on Kashyyyk. He has managed to track down the Transdoshian raiders to an asteroid base they are using as a staging area. They keep them there until they have enough to sell and a buyer. We're going to have to move quickly if we are going to rescue them. We're taking the Voidstalker and the two Y-wings. The asteroid is in the Cularin system asteroid belt. Looks like they are holed up in an old mining facility. Our mission is to rescue the Wookies and shut down the raiders. We know they have a few transport ships and some fighters for escorts but nothing specific."

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-09-29 16:50:05)

Arty listens to the breifing and couldn't keep the little grin from her lips, Yes she was outraged by the act of slavery but if this was a rescue that ment that she'd finally get to stop stalking the captin and make good use of her skills as the stealthy scout. Still....best to make sure. "Captin, will you be wanting a team to go in an locate the holding area?"

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-29 16:55:03)

Antur sits listening to the debriefing trying not to be obvious with his uncomfortable clothes. Antur shakes his head at the mention of slave trading "When we rescue the Wookies what is our fall back point?" Antur still makes every attempt to avoid direct eye contact with Jax, he also stops himself from absentmindedly putting his arm around Arty. Antur does risk a wink to Arty. "Will we be able to requisition heavier arms for any kind of raid on their compound?"

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **ganthet** (2008-09-29 16:59:22)

"So basically we are talking a smash and grab op. here." Deel looks around at everyone present. "We fly in take out the fighters and any defences get the prisoners and get out. Generally recking havoc the whole way correct?" Deel hopes his ascessment of the mission was correct. He started to think of what they might come up agaisnt. Most of it would be adhuck at best. He dougted the Empire would let the Lizard boys have anything to powerfull.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-09-29 17:02:23)

To Arty
"Of course once we secure the astreroid's air space we will infiltrate the facility eliminate any slavers and rescue as many wookies as possible. Meeto Im going to you to slice thier computer system if the have one and try to find any buyers and thier locations. Darraatoo will take anyone we rescue and use them to boost his own resistance."
To Antur
"Our fall back point is here, Tantive IV will be in the near by sector. What kind of firepower do you need?"
To Deel
"That sums it up nicely."

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Yogi** (2008-09-29 17:09:54)

Jake listens to the run down of the mission. "Will Antur and I be in VS 1 and 2 as normal on this one Captain? Also about their space forces. Do you want them captured or take out permanently?"
Slavers in Jake's mind were the lowest scum in the galaxy. They didn't need to to be shown any quarter.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Valheru** (2008-09-29 17:31:40)

While normally a pretty easy going guy the idea of slavery gets Biardiâ€™s blood boiling. Now that they have a target heâ€™s ready to go, no questions asked. The duros opens his mouth to say so but stops when he hears Jakeâ€™s question. â€œAh, yes, Commander Iâ€™ve been reading the latest mission report,â€ he indicates the datapad in his hand, â€œIf we arenâ€™t requisitioning another starfighter then would you like me to pilot the Voidstalker for now?â€ He doesnâ€™t want to stir up bad emotions over their previous pilotâ€™s condition, but fears itâ€™s rather unavoidable.
OOC: Iâ€™m assuming Biardi has access to the mission logs since heâ€™s now a member of the squadron. If thatâ€™s not the case then strike that part from my post, he definitely wouldnâ€™t steal them <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-09-29 17:34:10)

Arty nods her head, her free hand giving Antur a reasuring squeeze to his leg. She didn't want him to go back up like he had in the past, but he was a pilot and this is what he did. They were all soldiers and this was the life they chose, she didn't like it, but she accepted it. She wanted to ask if he'd be sending her in, but she'd wait for that.

Knowing himself to be late, Jordan walks into the briefing room, greets everyone including their wookie ally, and takes a seat.
"So, what did I miss?"

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-09-29 17:50:58)

Arty leans over to Antur with a smile, whispering in his ear "glad we weren't as late as Jordan." chuckles softly after before waving to the said late attendee

The purple amphibian shakes his head quizzically. "Umm, yousa can counten mesa outta dis one. Froggies n lizards dont mixin and shaken well."

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-29 18:27:39)

Antur nods to Jax and replies "Nothing series grenades and maybe some extra rifles. I am no expert on alien races but from what I have heard Wookies are a brave race and would most likely want to battle their way out at our sides. They could do that better with weapons." Antur nods to the Wookie`s gathered in the room.
Antur gives Arty a reassuring wink and smile. In a whisper "We could have spared an extra few minutes though. This shirt is killing me, I will have to buy you a new one."

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-09-29 18:52:26)

Arty chuckles and nods to him "I'm rather comfortable in yours, hope you don't mind if I keep it." she winks at him and looks around to the wookiee in the room with a hum "I'll need to brush up on the language.."

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-09-29 20:32:13)

Jax glares at Arty and Antur.
"Anyone have anything to discuss dealing with the mission and not whose under wear your wearing?"

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-09-29 20:56:55)

Arty blushes, hanging her head and mumbling out an appology while mumbling that it wasn't underwear it was his shirt. She looks to Antur with a blush and whisper of "I think we're introuble.."

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-29 22:47:26)

"Where do you want me in all this and what is our acceptable casualty rate?" Daxxon asks knowing this isn't going to be as easy as they think, especially since he had run across Slavers before though he won't mention to them he had worked with one or two when he was younger...not to the Wookie for sure he thought. " And I will require some armaments as well, A Grenade Launcher with 4 Sets of Stun Grenades should help keep the Casualty rate to a Minimum for Friendlies."
*ooc: by set I mean sets of Four for the Grenade Launcher (16 Stun Grenades in total)*

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-09-30 00:47:52)

Jax passes a datapad to Antur.
"Here are our official orders, take those to the quartermaster and you will be able to get what ever you need. Meet me in the hanger ready to go in three hours and be on time."

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **ganthet** (2008-09-30 01:30:21)

Deel hears the talk of weapons and casualites, it is unsettling to him. "I am fine with my blaster pistol. I am to assume that i will be heading in with the landing team in case I am needed for technical problems that might acure on the mission?" Deel is fine with the mission and will do his part he was no coward, he just had enuff with violence and would have liked to find another way but there wasn't one. "If I my Captain i would like to get started on preflight checks on the ships. My gear is allready to go."

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-30 01:39:16)

The Gungan looks shocked at the orders. He remains seated, and speaks up. "My not knowin' about dis life debt. Maybe its bein possible to just fradiee froggin out?"

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-09-30 01:42:38)

Arty frowns at the gungan "hey you owe me one!" she grins at him "Come on it'll be fun, you could probably help on the ship at least. maybe act as a distraction." She looks over to the captin and raises a brow "what you do you think?"

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-09-30 01:44:25)

Jax nods as Deel speaks
"Sure take Biardi with you show him around the voidstalker and get him up to speed on her specs since he's her new pilot."

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Valheru** (2008-09-30 02:15:06)

Biardi smiles at the news that he'll be piloting. Whether justified or not he'd feel pretty useless without being in a pilot's chair. "Excellent. Just let me grab my bag Deel and I'll meet you in the hangar bay." Taking the Commander's previous statement as a dismissal he exits the briefing room. He rushes to his room and grabs his gear, fortunately he'd packed this morning, then heads directly to the hangar. The duros is obviously excited to check out the Voidstalker.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-30 05:59:17)

Antur takes the data pad "Thanks captain." Standing he looks at Daxxon " Daxxon is it? Your with me you sound like you know a few things about weapons. Lets get what we need now so we will have time to get ready." Antur gives Arty`s hand a slight squeeze before heading out to the quartermaster.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Yogi** (2008-09-30 07:12:23)

Happy they they were moving Jake stands. "Antur, Daxxon I'll head to the Quartermaster with you. If were going up against some Transhodans I'd like something heavier than my blaster pistol and maybe some armor." He fell in line with the two. When they were out of earshot from Jax Jake looked at Antur. "Could you feel the Captain boring holes in you with his eyes."
Jake could understand Antur and Arty being happy but in the middle of the briefing the hand holding and whispering which most of them heard anyways was a bit out of line in his book. Still he was happy that two of his friends had found something to hold on to.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-30 07:39:29)

Meeto was attentive at the briefing, and nodded with confidence to Jax as told him what his responsibilities were to on the mission. Meeto was actually thrilled inside that he was going to be about to use his skills to actually do some good in the galaxy.
Meeto responded quickly when the Captain told him what he expected,'Shouldn't be a problem Captain.'
The misson was straight forward, but the danger was no less than any other mission. The fact the Meeto would have to jack into the computers and not access them remotely meant that he should be focused and rested. He will need to be 100% alert to access the computers as quickly as possible, droid programing would have to wait.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-30 08:05:53)

As Antur walks with Daxxon and Jake keeps a hard pace, this should be over soon then he could get on to more important matters. "Yea he comes across as kind of a fatherly type. I know this is a military operation but in many ways its not. Donâ€™t get me wrong I have no intentions of letting my personal life get in the way of our missions." Antur pauses then continues "Honestly though this rebellion military is composed of everything civilians ex cons even ex imperials. We have to remember what we are fighting for and like so many others in this bunch I donâ€™t have much these days. All I really have is you guys my squad and Arty." Antur pats his wing man on the back and changes the subject "So think you can keep up with on the kill count this time?"

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Yogi** (2008-09-30 08:24:36)

Jake nodded as Antur spoke about Arty and the rebellion. "I know. You guys are all I have left. I have a mother somewhere out there, maybe. My father never talked about the much."
Antur continued making a comment about the kill count on the mission. Jake smiled "Keep up sure. Surpass, maybe." He said with a smile. "As long as we all come out of it in one piece the kill count doesn't really matter."

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-09-30 09:59:38)

Arty watches Antur leave, somehow feeling that he was leaving him with the wolf though she tried to shake that off. Oh she knew if she was left alone with the captin she'd be getting a talking to which really was why as soon as Antur left she stood with a grin while avoid eye contact "well then I think I should start brushing up on my shyriiwook, so I'll be in my quarters packing and studying!" she makes a break for the door at a walk/jog she wouldn't run...not while in the room but the minute she got out she'd make a break for it; she just hoped she didn't get stoped first.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-30 10:02:34)

"IÂ´ll tag along too. Lizards have an annoying habit of staying alive, so we should make sure we can hit them hard"
He follows Antur and the others towards the quartermaster. He listens to the others when talking about having nothing left. *They donÂ´t even know the half of it…*. When the talk of death counts comes up, he laughs.
"Sorry boys, this mission is likely to take place more on solid ground than in the cockpit. DonÂ´t know if you flyboys can handle it, so stay out of the way, will you?"

Deel heads out of the meeting room to his guarters and grabs his gear and heads for the hanger to start preflight check. When he reaches the hanger he stous his gear and checks in with XO. "Hello there my little friend, how are things here. We need to get preflight started." Deel heads to the engine room to start the checks on the hyper-drive and sub-light engines.
"Oh and XO there will be some else coming pretty soon, he is the new pilot so try not to harass him to much." Deel smiles at the the driod.

Arty froze midstep, cursing internaly that she hadn't been quick enough out the door. She sighs and waits for the others to leave, hanging by the wall with her hands before her; in her mind she was running over everything he could say to her, everything that he could yell at her. In her mind, she figured she had best think up the worst things that could happen so that it wouldn't surprise her.
At mentioning he wanted to talk to her alone, the speechs in her head that he could give her got worse. Still she moved to him, standing rather than sitting as she gulped quietly.

Antur returns the mans half assed salute with one of his own "Yea I got orders and a request for gear." Antur casually throws the staff sgt the data pad. "I would say no rush but you know how it is around here. My squad mates here will give you the list of wanted goodies." Antur leans against the supply counter and waits.

The Staff sgt catches the datapad and looks it over. He looks up as you mention slavers. He walks over and grabs the underbarrel grenade launcher and four clips of stun grenades for you.
"Slavers are lower than the slime on a hutts arse. You sure you don't want anything a little more lethal?"
**Location:** *Briefing room*
Jax doesn't look happy.
"Arty I know this isn't exactly a real military yet but I'm planning on making Antur my second in command till Zim gets better and He is going to be responsible for all of your lives when Im not around. If he puts your welfare above anyone elses and he does something that gets one of your squadmates killed or injured because he is thinking about you or putting your welfare above the rest could you live with that? We are fighting against a giant here and eventually we will have casualties. Im not saying don't fall in love just be careful and keep you mind on the mission and don't be late anymore. It makes us look like amatuers."

She grins slightly and ruffles her hair "and I'm sorry we were late, it won't happen again I'll make sure of that, but.." she glances around for a minute to make sure they were as well alone as ones could be while in a briefing room.

Now let's check over the fighters and then maybe we can figure out what to do with the rest of our time." Deel grabbing his tools and data pad heads to the VS2,3 to start the preflights on them. "Zim is still in a coma in the med bay. The Doctors don't know when he will come out of it." Deel looks down at the little droid. "I wish he was here now to but we can use all the help we can get.

He rummages around in some cargo boxes and pulls out two pistol sized weapons.
"Ive been waiting for a reason to issue these to someone."
He lays down two DX-2 Disrupter pistols.
"These are illegal in almost every sector except Hutt space. These babies destroy the molecular bonds so if you kill someone the bodies are disintigrated. The only draw back is the slow fire rate. It needs about a six second delay to build up the energy to fire again."

Jordan eyes the pistols, but discards the thought. Not really his thing, he prefered more conventional weaponry.
"If you have a grenade launcher I can use on a rifle, that would be nice, as well as any kind of ammo you might have for it. You wouldnÂ´t happen to carry any Adhesive or CryoBan ones, would you? Like someone said, you donÂ´t want to look to close at the faces of those lizards"
He holds forward his old slug rifle, the weapon that has been serving him well for quite some time now.
"This baby has been working really well, but IÂ´m starting to feel a craving for the weapons of my own people. That Assault Rifle over there looks a lot like Mandalorian design, am I right?"
((If possible, perhaps the rifle might have the mandalorian template, that would make it easier to installe a grenade launcher <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> ))

"Ya we do. Follow me." Deel takes Daxxon to the medical suite. "It is not alot but it works for us, sort of. We have never had a Med Tech before, a few of us can do frist aid but that is about it." Deel looks around at the equipment there to make sure it is powered and working. "Well I need to head back to the engine room if you need anything fixes let me know." Deel heads to get things ready for wehn they take off.

A look of shock hits Anturs face "Ah ... yes sir! Thank you." Antur salutes Jax.Standing with a dumb founded look on his face Antur thinks to himself, I thought he hated me? Wonders never cease. Looking around Antur considers giving out an order but this crew knows its stuff and needs only minimal supervision. "Great work guys lets be ready to take off when the captain gets back." Man that was lame, best I could think of. Antur shrugs his shoulders and casually walks over to Arty "Need a hand with anything? Engine checks? Shirt check .... oh wait that's later." Antur realizes he is still wearing Arty`s shirt pulling on it again for a little more breathing room "That reminds me I need to change."

Meeto was everywhere, he stopped by the supply room quickly try to aquire some explosives. He visited the cockpit to make sure VS1's sensors and nav computer were operational and astrogation plots were set. He helped Deel out with pre-flight on all the ships, aiding him on the duties that Zim would have been doing. The Rodian didn't say much to anyone, he was efficient and finished all the work quickly. It was something the others didn't see very often, although very capable of being productive, Meeto always seem to work at his own pace, but this time he looked like he was trying to make up time.
He finally made time to speak with Deel handing him a data pad copy the he had been working on the past few days, 'You might find these interesting, I was able to compile a readout of those starships capability with the limited time are sensors were online. I didn't get much, but I have some data that might be useful to prepare us for the next attack. I hope we don't encounter any soon, they are vicious and pack a mighty punch for there size. They are extremely fast, but they have no shields which makes them vulnerable. They are short range fighters, no hyperdrives which means they come with company. Weapons were middle of the road, but with the agility combined with those weapons they are deadly.'
The Rodian made time to speak with the Duros and even spoke to him in his native tongue
Duro Speak, [hide]"Welcome to Void Stalkers, I'm Meeto ships sensor and communications officer, and I help Deel with repairs.'[/hide]
'I have nav points set and I set some saftey points in case we need to make a quick jump. I was on my way to program backup coordinates in XO in case we have a similar problem as last time. If I'm done here Deel I would like to take care of that.'
((OOC: I want to program nav points in XO this time, in case we lose our nav computer again we have a way to jump. After Meeto finishes with XO you can find him in his quarters working on his droids.))

Antur stops to look into Arty`s eyes, then thinks differently about what he was about to say. "I am on duty unfortunately. I will not have time to do much beyond changing clothes." with a wink Antur continues "Though I am sure we will be able to finish up a later tonight." Smiling Antur heads into his quarters and helps himself and Arty get changed into more comfortable clothes. The back out with the others to assist in making sure the crew and ship is ready.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-10-02 09:58:40)

Arty blushes at Antur after he had finished talking, really..that...that thought never even crossed her mind! really...ok maybe a little. She didn't complain, any time with him was wonderful and she made sure to make the most of it, after all he was in charge right now and she should behave herself.
Finally back in her own shirt she steps out of their quarters and hums softly "you know...I really think I liked yours better." she chuckles and kisses his cheek, sending him on his way while she went off to find her little droid buddy.

Deel takes the datapad from Meeto as he is finishing the powering up the engines. "Really, the Captain told me that they wouldn't be done with the analasis untill we got back from the mission." Deel looks over the info on it and is alittle amazed at what is there. "I will go over this and let you know my what I come up with." Deel returns to his dutys thinking about Zim and if they will run into the same trouble they had last time. "XO, you ready for another mission? You should find Arty she has been asking about you and she'll be looking for you if she is on board." Not waiting for the little driod to responed he finishes the engine start up.
((OCC: Mechcanics check +13 for getting the engine started up.))

**Sullustan**
Out of breath and giving the impression of being rushed a Sullustan male stepped into the flight deck. Average in practivally every respect including the clearly hand-me-down nature of his outfit, with a belt of tools and a backpack.
Scanning through a data pad and looking rather confused and more than a little upset he seems almost lost. Observers close enough would note his is mumbling to himself, something about a transport, scheduling, incompetant workforce coordination... He looks up at the VoidStalker, then back to his pad, then relaxes slightly. He nods then turns to someone in the hall behind him and points to the Voidstalker. Then sets out in a light jog to its boarding hatch.
Following him at matched speed is 2m tall droid, heavy set at the shoulders, carrying a duffel style pack on it's back and another in it's Left hand. It's right hand is held slightly to the side, head height, with it's forarm facing out. Aparantly some kind of stand-by mode. The only contrast to the gun metal grey of it's metalic body is the crimson scanning light of it's optic visor going back and forth.
When he gets to the ramp he addresses whoever is in view and says "I've got orders here to report to a Captain..." squints at the pad then sighs, "Jack?"

Returning Arty`s kiss Antur waves bye â€œLater itâ€™s a date, and now I can make it an order.â€ Chuckling and that last comment Antur watches Arty as she heads back inside the ship a little too long, damn he thinks to himself. I should get back to work.
Taking another inspection circle around the Void Stalker Antur notices the individual enter but keeps his focus on the driod in his shadow. â€œDo you have your orders?â€ Antur takes the pad and scans over it but remains fixed on the droid itself. â€œYour droid will have to be on standby mode, and the entire crew will need to be preprogrammed as non-hostile.â€ Finaly taking a moment to look over the Sullustan Antur continues â€œIt says nothing about you being a pilot or a mechanic? You can take a room and bunk up with Mar San.â€ Chuckling a little at that thought. "Oh and soldier his name is Captain Jax!"

Arty wanders around the ship, mumbling over various things to herself. Finding no droid that was her friend she sighs and makes her way back to where she last saw Antur *well..he is in charge..and I do so need practice..* she grins, oh...he would see why she was Jax's little terror.
Finding no pilot where they parted she pouts and moves to the ramp. She didn't even make it down the ramp as she spies him with a new member, all thoughts of surprising him gone as she smiles "hello!"

Captain Jax returns to the flight deck. He scans his squad working away.
"Lets kick some tires and light some fires boys. Voidstalker move out."
He heads for the bording ramp and spots the newcomer.
"You must be the boot the Admiral mentioned store your gear and have Deel or Arty get you up to speed, your bunking with the Gungan. Cage Golan! You fly the Y-wings out then dock up with the VS1 once we're clear of the Tantive IV. Lets move people we got Wookies to save and slaver to waste."
About five minutes later everyone is docked and back onboard the VS1.
"Ensign Vintos take us into lightspeed."

### **Yogi** (2008-10-02 12:50:01)

Jake nods, "Roger that captain." He quickly made his way to his Y-wing and got the start up going. Minutes later he was exiting the docking clamp into VS1. Nodding to Antur who was exiting next to him. "I wonder what they will have waiting for us there? Maybe it will be something interesting." He said as he put his strapped his helmet down near the entryway to his fighter so it would not roll around. He undid his flight suit but kept it on so that he'd be ready quickly.
Jake went to where the others would be stationed. "How long till we get there?"

**Dlir Sian**
> &#8230;&quot;Oh and soldier his name is Captain Jax!&quot;

Ignores but allows the rude removing of the pad from his grasp, even extending it so that this unidentified rufian doesn't have to bow to him to get it. Nods noting the *"his name"* and opens his mouth to ask where the bunk is and who Mar San is...
> &#8230;she smiles &quot;hello!&quot;

... Eyes widen and disposition suddenly brightens noticably and he takes a confident step forward with an extended hand and bright smile to this intriguing female. Poise is suddenly formal with a hand behind his back that opens palm facing the droid and closes back to a fist and a "come here" motion. (Almost inperceptible nod from the droid then it turns slightly facing the individual yet to be cleared by Dlirs actions. One would almost think it's glaring at him as he follows Dlir on board)
"Hello indeed! My name is Dlir and I am under orders and understanding that I'll be touring with this... fine vessel. Perhaps you can direct me & show me where to stow and provide an introduction to this Mar San? I'm to understand we'll sharing quarters. I'm afraid due to a rather unfortunate series of misunderstandings the transport that brought me here was running quite late and I think I missed a rather important breifing. Could I, possibly be brought up to speed?" *sparkle*
> &quot;You must be the boot the Admiral mentioned store your gear and have Deel or Arty get you up to speed, your bunking with the Gungan. Cage Golan! You fly the Y-wings out then dock up with the VS1 once we&#39;re clear of the Tantive IV. Lets move people we got Wookies to save and slaver to waste.&quot;

Spins around as the captain goes flying by. "Yes sir" turns back to the yet unidentified female. His expression is now an exercise in contrast. Cold. Hard. Resolved. "Slavers?" The droid behind him twitches it's raised arm slightly.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-10-02 13:08:40)

Arty raises a brow at the suddenly formal man, still her smile is in place, bright and cheerful. "Course I'll show you! just..." she trails off with the entrence to the captin, watching him go with a laugh, then turn again to the new member "mmhmm, we're on a rescue mission. Come on I'll show you your quarters." she turns back to the ship and inside, pausing to again turn to him with a welcoming smile "My names Artemis by the way, Arty for short." a glance to the droid and a wider grin "hey! a friend for X0! he should be happy." she chatters aimlessly about the droid that was her best friend as she leads him to the quarters to be shared with a light warning of "He's a gungan" thrown in once.
She pauses by the door and smiles lightly, seems a smile was always in place on her lips. A blow of hair to get her oddly colored hair from her face "if you need anything feel free to ask, and welcome aboard."
Once they had finally taken off, Arty wanders around the ship, once again trying to find her little droid friend.

Politely smiling and nodding where appropriate "Thank you very much ... Arty. I'm hoping I can find a way to contribute... Oh!" Pats at his sides "What he supposed to take that pad?" Bright grin. "Thank you again for your kind welcome." Leans forward slightly and whispers "I'm sure Captain Jax will let me know this eventually but do you know where my action stations are?"

You arrive at Jax's quarters and knock. The door opens and X0 wheels out and chirps happily to Arty. Jax is sitting at a desk looking over a datapad.
"What's up Arty? Oh you have the FNG of the FNGs. Have a seat."
He points to a couple chairs near the desk.
"You want some Caff?"
The question was directed to either of you.

Seeing as Antur was here and a chair didn't seem comfortable anymore, she promptly takes a seat in Anturs lap, throwing her legs over the arm of the chair and relaxes. She'd move of course if asked or if the captin gave her that look tends to give when he wanted her to stop doing something but for now, she enjoyed being near her pilot love.

## Re: Wookie-pops

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-02 14:55:13)

Antur smiles when Arty jumps into his lap even offering her a sip of his caf. " You know me Jax er captain I am not military, I will do the best job I can whatever roll you assign to me. I think I have proven that fact by now. I do have the knowledge to run this operation, and as appealing as my personal life is." Antur throws Arty a wink. "It will not interfere with my duties. But Jax you know this squad is tight, we are family. At first glance it might look like a weakness but it makes us stronger allows us to work together like no other squad. I will not let you down."

"Understood" Red Eye enters the cabin as Dlir is whisked away.
Watches the interactions, relaxing slightly, especially Antur & Arty.

Opens his mouth to speak then waits politely for the banter to allow an opening and listening to the relationships being narated... interesting.
"With not being any organized military, someone needs to arrange for supplies, materials such as spare parts, gear, and in the case of some other endevours, weapons. Indeed a Freelance?

She wouldn't say what was on her mind while in the company of other members of the crew but her look said it all *you even THINK about interupting and I'll do something bad to your room.* the last is a little hazy..bad was sure but room could very well only be the start.

He takes comfort in his solace but he begins to think more about the slavers they are going to run into and playing it out in his head that if he runs into the ones he worked for before he may have to kill them before they recognized him, then he let the thoughts go and began to prep his weapons going over them making sure they were up to the task. He didn't expect any of the others to come see him, he knows he put them off but he starts to wonder ~why don't the credits make me as happy as they use too anymore what am I missing...~

He'll accompany him into the hallway then speaking in Basic: "Could you please introduce me to Deel? I was also wanting to know what my action stations will be, I'd rather prefer to contribute should we come under fire." Leans in slightly and whispers, "and I don't mean any disrepsect, but could you please tell me what happened with this person 'Zim' that ... Jax mentioned?".

Still trying to get a comfort spot Antur continues to wiggle around "I am sure this thing squeaks." Antur takes another look at Dlir`s order pad. "Well we could always use someone on shields or sensors; do you have any skill with a hydro-spanner?"

Jake walked into the command deck and saw Antur and the new guy there. Antur was squirming in the chair trying to do something. He walked up behind his friend and clapped him on the shoulder. "Better not let the Captain see you in there he'll take away your shore leave next time we get some. Then what are you going to do?" He said with a chuckle.

"Biardi whats our ETA?"

*I suppose that's a safer title, Ha!* Taking his que from Antur, yet another subtle dismissal. He throws extra enthusiasm in to his smile & gives Jakes hand a confident shake.

In the engine room Deel is checking to make sure everything is running smothly. He hears Antur's voice come over the comms asking him to come to the flight deck. "On my way." Deel grabs his data pad and the one Meeto gave him, heading to the flight deck.
Reaching the flight deck, "What can I do for you Antur?" Deel waits for Antur to answer. Seeing the new guy Deel smiles and nods. "Welcome to the Voidstalkers, I am Deel ships mechcanic."

Antur waves Deel over "Hey Deel! Meet Dlir Sian our new quarter master. He has some skill with a hydro-spanner and will give you back up on repairs. No replacement for you though I am sure." Antur pats Deel on the back and motions to Dlir Sian.

Jax looks up from the datapad he was reading.
"Hey Revv. I'm hoping we can sneak in with out notice but if they wanna fight we will give it to them. Im assuming that thier fighters will provide cover while they try and load as many slaves as possible into thier transport. Then we will have to secure an airlock and clear out any resistance and evac as many Wookies as we can."

Jordan takes his leave, making his way to the flight deck, seeing Antur, Jake and Deel gathered there, along a new guy.
"Hey guys, whatÂ´s up?"

Jake shook hand and gave it a pump. "Well the Trandos have been dealing the Wookies as slaves for a while now. The some info from the wookies Command was able to trace down a base of ops for the Trandos. That's where we come in. We're to take out any naval forces they have and then board them to free the captives that have. Hopefully we'll get as many as we can before the slavers start killing off the captives.

Arty wanders around after meeting with Jax, the new guy, and Antur. Antur, she holds back a squeel, they had a date! One they'd be able to keep she thought. She hums happily as she makes her way around the halls. A thought strikes her as she walks, she hadn't cleaned X0 lately. Another smile, he'd enjoy that! she pauses now as she remembers the new guy had a droid too, maybe he'd like a good cleaning too. "Hm...best ask, maybe there's some protocal I'd need to know."
Since he had followed Antur, she knew just where to find both and grins at the group there "Hey guys! Dlir I was planning to give X0 a cleaning, think your droid friend would like one too?"

She laughs at the excited beeping and moves back to him, she gets comfortable on the floor and begins to work; but not before letting loose a little robotic duck. She'd gotten it once with the Captin and brought it back to the little droid, it'd been his cleaning toy ever since.

**Dlir Sian : Void Stalker 1 : Computer/shield access station**
Red Eye is inert in the cabin having completed charging just before we reverted to realspace.
Dlir reflects on his conversation with Deel about parts and gear they'd like to see, modifications to the Void Stalker(s) etc. Internal sensors enhancments would be great! Aparantly there's a need for astromechs for the Y-wings. Since they are used as snubs, but are built as long range solo probes, there are lots that can be done with them. Perhaps some time to work on them when we get back. After spending the last 2 days connecting with the crew Dlir is a little more at ease, old habbits never die.
Dlir sets his sensor display and makes sure the in place encryptions are aligned with his comm (don't want the Trandosians to hear his chatter). Shields are up either before they revert to realspace or just after since we are going in hot. (OOC however that works. His station is on the bridge I'm assuming, either that or engineering. I'm assuming no problems with getting the sheilds up. I'll take any needed actions to get the shields up and full round actions to restore any damage they take). Once that reads positive Dlir will report "Asses covered."

Besides, none of you can keep up with a proton torpedo!â€. Suddenly a concerned look replaces Biardiâ€™s grin, â€œUhâ€¦captain, you donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll be any wookies onboard the trando ships do you?â€ The thought of unknowingly incinerating the slaves with a torpedo horrifies him.

The asteroid field is full of large metal heavy boulders which is reeking havoc with sensors. You've been searching for any signs of life for the last hours or so with no results.

Antur swings his Y-wing towards the asteroid field "Ok cut the chatter guys I have bogeys incoming. Going hot now, Jake form up on my wing for our attack run." Antur raises the shields and arms the weapons, bringing the Y-wing to full speed. "Only five contacts watch for others. Can we get a reading on what we are facing here?"

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-10-06 10:32:02)

You all divert ypur sensors to the area Antur designated and you all see the incoming fighters. Sensor reading make them for Novasword space superiority fighters. They are well armed with lasers and missles. The are flying through the asteroid field with what seems like alot of practice. No sign of where they came from but they are on an intercept course.
*ooc:Im going to work init based of each ship so one roll for entire ship and then everyone one the ship goes at that time make sense?

"They are Subpro's replacement for the old Z-95 headhunters, they have decent shields , great manueverability and a built in hyperdrive. Looks like standard armorments are a laser cannon and concussion missles. They have comprable speed to the Y-wings and the VS1."

Antur smiles knowing his squad has his back, and he also know his girl would not let anything bad happen to him. " After we launch the torps we head in for interception which should allow Void one to pick them off." Antur`s controls go green the ship is to full power.

"Copy that Antur. Lets take it to medium range for the torps." It was riskier but afforded better chances of a hit. Jake begins to get a targeting solution on one of the lead enemy fighters. "I got a firing solution. Letting 'em fly" Jake pulled the trigger and two torps lanced out ahead of him at the oncoming fighters. He banked as hard as the Y-wing would let him and set course for VS1.

The Y-wings lead the charge towards the incoming fighters but the voidstalker isn't far behind.
The asteroids vary in size and shape and rotation. The battlefield is an obsticle course of debris making it impossible to do any sort of straight flying. You weave your way towards the fighters trying to keep them in line of sight.

VS1 Crew -20

Jake felt some relief when his torps impacted on the enemy fighter as it cut down the odds a bit. The distances were closing quickly and VS1 was pretty much in the thick of it. Jake activated his comm. "VS1 if you guys can handle Trando three and four I'll engage one and two to keep them from coming in on your six. I'm on Trando 1. You with me Antur?" Jake angled towards Trandos one and two and opened up with a burst from his ion cannons since they were better at this range.

Jake watched as VS1 finished off the remaining fighter. He swung his fighter around to form back up with the others. "We seem to be clear out here for now but stay sharp." He rolled around the asteroids easily and came up along side. "I'm in the green." He responded to both Arty and Deel. "The paint is scratched and body a bit dented but otherwise good to go."

Jax seems to mull the situation over for a moment then gets a smile on his face.
"Ok people we are going in hot. Jake Antur dock up with VS1. Once they are on board Biardi launch a missle at the power generator."
He points to an area next to the docking bay, you can see a power generator has been rigged up to the facility.
"That will drop the shielding for the hanger as well as cut power to the facility. When the shields drop we land, Arty Daxxon nail that transport with ion cannons I don't want them going anywhere. We land and secure the bay, once we have done that we eliminate all restance and free some wookies."

Once her headset was back on she swings around to get a lock on the transport that will be coming up. She didn't normaly mind staying in the ship but she hoped that atleast she'd get to go in this time, after all, they might need someone to scout ahead.

Jake hears the Captains plan and nods his head in his Y-wing. "Copy that Captain. heading back to ya." He swung his ship around and set an intercept course for VS1. A few moments later he was linked up and exiting his craft. Grabbing his equipment for the boarding action he smiled when he hooked the grenades to his gear. "These should come in handy." He said out loud to nobody. He made his way to the boarding ramp where they would be embarking on to the facility.

As Jake comes onto the boarding ramp, Jordan greets him. He was just underway packing two block of detonite into his gear. Holding up the plastic explosove, he grinned.
"I have a feeling we might need these, in case something is in our way. Just hope we donÂ´t have to blow up something that can potentially be a rift to the space outside. ThatÂ´s never something you want to do"
It seemed like he knew what he was talking about.

The voidstalker swims through the asteroid field like a hungry shark. It closes towards the asteroid base and unleashes its deadly payload. A ball of fire erupts from the power generator and the lights flicker and go dark. Biardi swoops into the bay as Arty and Daxxon let loose several blasts from the ion cannons. Biardi lands the ship and the boarding ramp drops.

Red Eye completes his startup and systems diagnostic in is typical fraction of a secon efficiency then looks at Dlirs tense expression and watches him checking his pistol. "Combat?"
With a shuddered sigh "Yes old friend. I'm afraid so. I really should have named you Proxy, would have made more sense." Looks at Red Eyse scanner then smiles and looks down at his PDA to pull up his command interface, "or not. Ok autonomous check recite please."
"Profiles of the crew loaded and verified. Their survival is your survival. Your survival is my survival. Actions at your command." Red Eye pauses, waiting for Dlirs nod of satisfaction and pride. "Targets?"
Dlirs expression darkens, Red Eye leans forward slightly, Dlir sets his LR comlink and enables the scrambler then says "Slavers" at a whisper.
Red Eyes arm snaps up to ready position with an intimidating (to others) enthusiasm "Slavers". His voice almost quivering.

The squad makes its way to a large door. The door has been blown open from the damage it looks like it was a while ago. Beyond it you see a long hallway. Coming down the hall way is a group of Trandoshians heavily armed moving carefully looking out for trouble.
*Location:* **Ghtroc Freighter**
You start to move up the ramp when you hear an all to familiar sound of metal hitting metal.
*Tink tink tink* Jordan knows this sound having heard it before. Grenade! A ball comes bouncing down the ramp.

Jake moved with the others watching out for any signs of the station personnel. It was quiet. Almost too quiet. Ahead of them was a large that from the looks of it had been blown open long ago. Coming up to the door Jake took the precaution of peering around the corner. Surprised to see a group of Trandos coming down the long corridor Jake quickly backed up and motioned for the group to stop.
He looked at them and gave the hand signals that indicated that there was a group (he would indicate however many there were and how far close they were.) He grabbed a frag grenade off his bandoleer and got ready to toss it down the corridor. He waited to see what the others were doing.

Jake sighed as he watched the other two begin their attack on the Tranos. *So much for a coordinated attack from all of us. Might as well get in on it.* He thought to himself.
Jake pulled the pin on the frag grenade and gave it a heave to down the hall in the direction of the enemy group. "Eat this slavers." he said under his breath.

After the grenade made the floor quake and the ramp jump Dlir started cowering. Seeing his friends blown to chum by shrapnel & shockwaves from rampaging suicide droids can make a noncom a little gun-shy, or grenade shy in this case. Dlir stays put with his wrapped around either side of his head rocking slightly sitting and quivering.
Red Eye down on one knee with wrist blasters deployed and scanning what arc can be seen from underneath the ramp. He will hold fire and actions untill prompted. He will not speak or fire thereby drawing attention to himself and Dlir. Hoping that someone doesn't scream in their direction to draw attention that way. Red Eye is aware that Dlir is vulnerable.

It wasn't so bad..but it burned; she waits there for a few minutes for the pain to subside enough for her to use her arm comfortably, then moves to the balls of her feet in a crouch, stepping back into the shadows to make her way to the others and help with the rest of the battle.

Daxxon, Arty, and Biardi charge up the ramp and unload into the Trando not in melee. The combined fire blows him away

Deel looks around as the Trando falls. "Cover me, I am going to start checking the engines." Deel quickly moves to the rear of the ship looking for enginering section. Keeping his blaster at the ready he hopes there will not be any surprises aft.

Feeling a thin line of blood running from the mark where the trandoshans claw had struck him, Jordan slammed the others rifle aside, brining himself up face to face with the other, pushing his gun close into the side of his enemy.
"Will you just die, alright?"
He pushed the trigger.
((Attack +7, 3d8+3 energy damage. Spend a Force Point on the attack roll if necessary. Should the sucker finally die, IÂ´ll move forward down the corridor))

Jordan Blows a hole through the remaining Trando. Blood and lizard guts spray everywhere. What ever he ate for lunch doesn't smell very good.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-24 11:43:49)

Jordan turned away a little, as blood and whatever splashed over him. Not that he hadnÂ´t seen it coming though. Kicking the body aside, he proceeded down the corridor he had entered, checking all rooms and possible places where a lizard might hid itself. And if one did, heÂ´d blow it to pieces.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Yogi** (2008-10-24 12:16:18)

Jake could hear hear blaster fire coming from the direction of the freighter. Judging from the alien sounding screams He figured the fight was going well for his friends. When the noise died down he looked at Jax. "I wonder how they are doing over there?" As he spoke he grabbed his comlink. "Antur, What the sit rep there? Need any more help?" The mission has gone well so far. *All we have to do now is find the wookies and clear out.* He thought to himself.
He looked at Jax. "Well Captain shall we head to the area where we detected the lifeforms?"

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-24 12:26:06)

Checking around but not finding anything, Jordan returns to where his friends are standing. he figured he had to look pretty bad, and drew a hand across his face to wipe it of a little.
"No problem Arty, this isnÂ´t mine...most of it anyway. But IÂ´m a little worried about this"
He points towards a shallow gash along the left side of his head, ending around his temple.
"It doesnÂ´t feel very deep, but you never know where a trandoshanÂ´s claws have been. Is Daxxon around here somewhere?"

Daxxon walks up to Jordan "Lets take care of your little memento for our dead Trando..." Daxxon leans his rifle against the Ships inner hull wall and put his Medkit off his back and gets out one of his Medpac's as he begins to disinfect it and apply some of the pacs bacta pads with some butterfly (ooc:the ones that seal cuts if you have ever seen them) bandages the looks Jordan over "You should be fine, but try not to catch any blaster fire or any Trando claws with your face for awhile ok?"

Arty chuckles as she takes a seat, holding her arm out for him to work easier "what can I say, you don't poke and prod like the other doctors!" she laughs and grins happily, wincing at a few sharp pains and hissing at others but generally tries to sit still.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-25 05:20:32)

Jordan laughs at Daxxon.
"CanÂ´t promise that doc. But IÂ´ll try to shoot them before they see me"
He picks up his rifle, and clicks his comm.
"All clear captain, moving out"
He moves out of the freighter, and over to Jax.
"So, whatÂ´s next captain?"

Antur walks over to Dlir and pulls him from under the ramp. Patting him on the back "Great job guarding the ramps under side." Antur walks back to Arty watching her get treated. As Jax coms in Antur responds "Antur here all good just patching up the troops before moving on sir!"

**Dlir: Cowering behind the Ghtroc ramp
Red Eye: Crouched just to one side of Dlir**
At the sound of the com Dlir jerks and blinks sweat from his eyes & wipes his face. "H...Here ok. I'm still under the ramp of the freighter." Dlir mutes on his end and stands up, still shaking, then nods to Red Eye. He mumbles a curse after hearing his voice crack on the com. Then squeezes his eyes shut & tries to get control of his breathing with his left hand on his lower chest, and his right hand clenching and unchlenching at his side.
Red Eye rises with him and at the nod returns his forearm to ready (pointed up) then falls in behind and to one side of Dlir. He still scans around him but as his scan reaches Dlir it pauses a few times then returns to the rest of the room.
At Anturs joke Dlir smiles weakly and walks with him. Red Eye follows.

Jax calls for everyone's sit rep. Jake smiled and calls out next to the Captain. "All clear and ready to go Captain." A big grin on his face as he hadn't left Jax's side here at the hallway door since they staked it out. He see the others walk up. "You all ok? Do we have ourselves another ship to fill the rebellions fleet?"

### **Yogi** (2008-10-27 04:16:28)

Jake pipes up on the topic of theie being any more Trandos. "Doesn't matter if there are or not we still have a job to do. Get the Wookies out of here." He looks around and down the hallway. "And the sooner the better I think." He checked the settings on his carbine satisfied with ow they looked he made himself ready to go.

### **zerah** (2008-10-27 12:02:50)

Arty nods her head and moves in front of him waiting for the others to get to their points, and giving Antur a smile of reasurence, before she ducked low and into the shadows for cover. Keeping slow and quiet as she looks around for any signs of attack or better, the wookiees.

*Arty*
Emergency lights provide the only source of illumination down the hallway. You move cautiously forward through another set of blast doors. You are about to move through them when a glint of red catches your eye. You examine the doorway and discover a small emitter sending an infra-red beam across the doorway.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-27 13:36:05)

Falling into line, Jordan takes point in the group, and watches Arty sprint a little bit ahead. Keeping himself as hidden as possible, he proceeds forward. As she approaches a set of blast doors, she stops and seems to examine the doorway carefully. Moving forward, walks up alongside the wall.
"Any problems?"
Waiting for an answer, he spies through the doors, looking for any sign of movement.
((Perception +9, Stealth +10))

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-10-27 16:05:53)

Arty whispers back to Jordan "Infra-red beam...might active an alarm if it's trigered. Control panel should be somewhere, maybe we can turn it off."
She says while searching with her eyes around the room for anything that looks like a control panel or a means to shut off the beam. "Signal the others to hold."

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-10-27 16:11:21)

*Arty & Jordan*
The emitter seems to be placed in the inner side of the hatch just above foot level. Carefully looking in you see a wire moving along the inside of the hatch that goes up to the ceiling where an explosive charge has been placed.
Rest of the squad recieves the hand signal to hold and stops in their tracks.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-10-27 16:50:27)

### **zerah** (2008-10-27 17:06:02)

Arty sighs and looks back to the group "I'll tell the Captin, see if you can find a way around it at least as a backup plan." She then melds back into the shadows and over to the Captin, relying what they've found and they have no tools to disarm the explosive.
*Stealth +15 to get back to the captin*

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-10-27 17:12:02)

Jax listens to the description Arty gives him.
"It sounds like it was set up to keep us from getting to them to quickly, it's just a way to buy some time, or at least kill a few of us if we didn't know about it. Anyone have a security kit?"

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-27 17:17:13)

Jordan cannot find any good way to disarm the explosive with the tools he has at hand, short of firing on it. And he doesnÂ´t feel that would be a good thing to do. While Arty returns to the rest of the group, he keeps his vigil up, ready to take down any approaching enemy.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Yogi** (2008-10-27 17:18:38)

Jake listens as Arty and Jax speak and the Captains request for a security kit. Jake pipes up. Maybe a concussion grenade could set it off and then we could get through quickly. Let them think that they killed some of us off also. It's not the best plan but it would work."

### **Valheru** (2008-10-27 20:12:13)

Dlir & Red Eye: waiting patiently in line.
Dlir listens to the debate letting the pace of the conversation calm him. Takes a shakey breath then: "Setting a trap would require time for them to investigate right? I thought this was rather time sensitive. Do they have another way off this rock? Are they going to execute their stock if they are pressed into a corner? I don't recall hearing that."

Daxxon pauses then regains his thoughts "I think we should do something and fast, even if we have to lop off a Trando Head and Roll it through the door to set if off..."

Deel walks quitely with the others trying to think of what he will need to get the transport running so they could take it back with them. Hearing his team mates talking about lopping of heads and making thing go boom. Pulling out his security kit. "Guys stand a side. I'll disarm it and then you can dismember is poor soul without killing us all." Deel moves close to the explosive and starts to disarm it.

### **ganthet** (2008-10-28 12:38:04)

Deel looks over the device, seeing which wire lead where. After a few seconds of his nerves getting tested to the limit he spots what he was looking for. The one wire that would deactiveate the bomb and save the day. Carefully he takes out his cutter and every gentlely gets them into place to make the cut. With his heads tails twitching he starts to make the cut. With a snip sound over the wire being severed and the device deactivating Deel breathes a shy of relief. He looks up at his friends. "All finished, now I need a drink." He says smiling.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-10-28 12:49:07)

Once Deel gives the all clear signal Jax motions for Arty to take her place at point and scout ahead. She moves into the next room. This room looks unused maybe an old control station for the other docking sites. There is only one way to go out of the room. As Arty stealthily approaches she hears someone whispering up ahead in a hissing type language.

### **zerah** (2008-10-28 12:53:55)

Arty pauses at the voices, suddenly cursing internally for not even thinking of trying to learn the language of the people they were fighting *stupid Arty, you know better than that* her mind tells her. She doubles back enough to be seen by the party and gives them the motion to hold, she had planned to go straight to Jax and tell him she heared voices but a thought struck that if there weren't too many of them...best try to count the voices or even better, get a better view.

### **Frost** (2008-10-28 14:13:20)

*So 7 all together*

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-10-28 14:16:52)

Arty frowns and quietly moves back into the shadows and away from the door. Once clear she quickly moves back to Jax reporting what she saw "Seven of them, and looks like they're getting ready to fight us. we could try to pick them off or we could see about another way.."

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-28 14:22:27)

At the mention of the numbers of their opponents, Jordan begins to load his rifle with frag grenades, four in total. Looking over at Arty, he asks with a smile on his face:
"How far dug in were they? Do you think it would be impossible to get them to chase a lone soldier into this hallway?"

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-10-28 14:26:30)

Arty blinks then grins "Not that far, they are waiting though and baracading. Though an ambush would be interesting..." She glances around and grins sheepishly "I personally have no qalms of staying in the shadows by the door and picking them off from the back."

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-28 14:35:52)

Antur listens to Arty`s report. "An ambush would be wise, we could take them by surprise and possible finish them before they knew their prey was hunting them." Antur looks at Arty thinking to himself, *be careful over there*. Antur reloads his blaster making sure its topped off.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-28 14:38:32)

### **Valheru** (2008-10-28 14:55:18)

Biardi is impressed by Deel's skillful handling of the explosive. "Nicely done, the first round's on me after this is over," he says with a grin. The duros suddenly has an idea, "Hey do you think we could salvage the explosive and use it as a makeshift bomb? That'd give those trandos a nasty surprise!". OOC: I'll assist you on the Mechanics check if you want to try it, with a +9 I can't fail the aid another check.
When Jordan mentions his plan to bait the slavers into chasing him Biardi thinks to himself, *'Well he certainly is brave.'* Thinking it over he responds, "A bold strategy, but if they don't fall for it we'll just be letting them know we've already bypassed their little door trap. Then again...I've never seen a trando back down from a fight."

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **ganthet** (2008-10-29 01:42:31)

Deel thinks it over for a second or to. "Well ya I suppose I could. What do you think about it Captain?" Deel doesn't like messing with thing that can kill him in a large fireball. "I can rig it to blow or try to use it if some of them try to come after us when we are try to leave. Nothing like a bomb in your aft end to ruin your day." "Wire it to a comm link and and use it as a remote to blow it when we need to."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-29 14:33:15)

"Leave that to me Deel. Not that itÂ´s not possible to rig such a makseshift bomb, but I happen to have stuff ready to use right here"
He grins and turns to Biardi.
"It should just be a matter of finding the right insult to throw at them, and theyÂ´ll be seeing red at once. What do you think captain?"

Jake Listened to the others as they figured out what to do then spoke quietly so the others could hear. "Look whatever we decide to do we need to do it now before they barricade themselves in any more and make it real tough for us to get to them. We also have the Wookies to worry about. The longer we delay the more the danger they are in." He looked around. He really wanted to get moving.

"Jake stay with me." Jax said as he gave his orders.

Tracing their steps back to the landing bay, Jordan finds a crawlway. It seems like it is running along the same corridor the went down, but under the floor. Clicking his comm, he calls quietly for Jax.
"Captain, IÂ´ve found something. It is a crawlway that seems to run underneath the hallway you are in. Should I investigate?"
A brilliant idea entering his mind, he quickly adds:
"If you want to, I can try to see if I can get in right underneath those lizards. I could rig something to blast their scales off, and then you can just move in for the quick kill"

"Roger that captain...now letÂ´s just see if I can fit in here..."
Putting his rifle on his back, Jordan starts to crawl down the tunnel. Trying to remember the layout of the hallway, he assumes that the tunnel follows it completely, and he stops when he feel that he should have the trandoshans right over him. He takes a few moments to try and listen for any sounds that would indicate he is right.
((Hopefully, it shouldnÂ´t be a problem to get in under the trandos, if some check is required, just make it))

Being certain that he had reached the right spot, Jordan started to rig his explosives. It would be a big bang underneath the lizardÂ´s feet, he would make sure of that. Once done, he set the timer to give him some time to get out of the tunnel before it blew. You donÂ´t want to be in a tunnel when an explosive goes off. He had done it once before, and that was the day he painted his armor black.
((Mechanics +10, so setting the detonator is auto-sucess. It also makes +2 dice of damage, for a total of 7d6. IÂ´ll use a timed detonator, set for 1 or 2 minutes or so, so that I can get out of the crawlway))

You think your in the right spot. You can here the scratching of clawed feet on metal above you. You place the explosive and crawl like mad to get out of the tunnel. Your trying to squeeze out of the entrance when Jax reaches down and basically pulls you out and you both roll to the side as the explosion deafens everyone for a moment. When the dust clears a quick check down the hall reveals that the ambushers got bushwacked.

Jake turned his head as the explosion ripped into the area that Jordan had set them. The loud boom caused a ringing in his ears and the resulting dust and debris caused his vision to be reduced blocking the area the Trandos were in. As the dust settled He saw that Jordan had set the charges perfectly and the enemy took the full force of the blast.
He looked at Jax. "Shall we go?" With he got the nod from the Captain he moved out down the hall eyes open for any survivors.

Arty's hands were over her ears in an effort to save some of her hearing from the ringing that would come, eyes closed and leaning to Antur when the blast went off. Once it was over she peaks over to where it had been and to the others. "Looks like you did it Jordan." she whispers with a grin, giving Antur a light peak for luck she moves off, following Jake into the room and looking around. Checking the room for any more traps or even better, something to help them later.

"Remind me to check where I got those timers from when we get out of here, they were a few seconds early. But at least it did the trick"

The Hallway leads to some sort of storage area where the old miners would store the ore for transport to refineries. You see several cages filled with wookies. You also see sveral trandos. They seem to be in two groups. One group seems to be the leader and his cronies as they are frantically trying to get thier computers and such packed up. The other group is against the wall. They are placing chragers of thier own. The wall if breached will open out into space.

Biardi takes a shot at the trando holding the detonator. His shot connect the trando drops to his knees but he is still alive.
*Roll: 14+5=19 10 Dmg!*
Jordan charges forward with his rifle blazing away His burst takes the trando back off his knees and sends him flying backwards. He twitches and doesn't move again.
*Roll: 13+2+4 Fp=17 Hit! 33 Dmg!*
Arty rushes over and helps the wookies rush out of the cage
Dlir uses whats left of Red eye as cover as he sprays the area making the trandos duck for cover.
*Dlir: Aid another +2*
Jake fires at the trandos b y the computer system. His shot connects with one of the lackeys and he goes down.
*Roll: 17+9= 26 Hit! 19 Dmg!*
Deel lies unconcious
Antur quickly changes direction as the bomber gets dropped. He spins and fires and the other Trando goes down.
*Roll: 16+6=22 Hit! 18 Dmg!*
Jax charges forward with his blaster fireing as fast as possible. He nails the leader but he retains his feet and looks ready to return fire.
*Attack: 23 Hit! 18 Dmg!*
Draxxon charges forward as well trying to get to the fallen comrade as fast as possible before he bleeds out.
The leader gets ready to take his shot at Jax as he recklessly charges forward before he can take the shot he is swarmed by giant walking carpets looking for lizard limbs. He screams horribly as the enraged wookies tear him apart.

With combat over and the adrenaline leaving his system Biardi starts to check on Deel even though he knows he'd probably only get in Daxxon's way. Suddenly the thought occurs to him that the explosive charges might still detonate and he stops in his tracks. Cursing himself for a fool he rushes over to make sure they're not armed.

Daxxon reaches Deel, with such speed from his time and experience he begins cutting his shirt to clear it as an obstruction to the gaping wound right below his neck. ~He is lucky his head wasn't blown off~ Daxxon thinks to himself, as he applies pressure to the wound. "He is still alive but I have to stabilize him and start Surgery Now!" As soon as the Bleeding stops he gives him a small sedative to keep him from moving and causing more bleeding. He then begins cleaning the wound to then apply the Skin strips to close the wound.

Not even slowing in his steps, Jordan moves over to the fallen trandoshan, making sure he has the detonator under his control. Seeing as Daxxon has Deel under control, he moves to Biardi, helping him with the disarming of the explosives.

Arty sighs with relief as the last of the lizard things goes down and the others start to work on the detonator and work on their friend. She watches the wookiees for a minute before moving to find Jax and Antur, she wanted to make sure they were both ok. Finding Jaz first she grins at him as she puts her blaster away to pat his shoulder.

## Re:Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-12-08 14:16:10)

Jax goes over after returning Arty's pat and checks on Deel and offers any assistance that Daxxon might need.
"We have a med bay onboard the Voidstalker if you can stabalize him for transport. Arty you speak wookie right? Try and get these guys organized and onboard the ships. Antur go with her and see if you guys can get the other ship working so we can get us all off of here in one trip. Take X0 with you I'm sure he will be useful."
Jordan and Biardi work on the explosives for a few minutes and manage to remove the detanotor from the plastique.

Arty nods her head, smiling over to Antur before turning to the Wookiees "If you would all kindly follow us we'll be able to get to work on the other ship and get some of you onto our ship. The bad parts over now, you're almost off this rock." She smiles brightly and begins ushering the beings out of the room.

Once they got the detonator removed, and thus safely neutralized the explosives, Jordan began to recover the plastic explosives. The lizards had set up a bunch of charges, and he didnÂ´t really wanted to just leave it to waste.

Arty holds up her hands in a show she ment no harm "My name is Artemis, Arty for short. We don't mean you any harm, we came to rescue you and take you away from here to go home." She doesn't look away from the tall and very angry wookiee.

## Re:Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-12-08 15:19:58)

A loud roar goes up amongst the wookies and Arty finds herself being crushed in the hugs of several large wookies. The large one who came forward picks her up and places her on his large shoulder.

## Re:Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2008-12-08 15:27:21)

When someone tells you that a wookiee is strong, you believe them, just as when someone tells you, they just about wet their pants when a wookiee is charging you believe them. So when there was suddenly a lot of large wookiees rushing to you and crushing your organs in hugs, you are allowed to squeal like a little girl. Though she had to admit, Arty was damn proud her pants were dry though she was clinging for dear life from the shoulders of a very...very tall wookiee.
Still, after the shock of it all, she was laughing and grinning brightly "Lets go fix up that ship and get out of here!"

After packing the explosive charges in his belt, Jordan picks up his rifle and moves over to Daxxon and Deel.
"You need some help there? IÂ´m no doctor, but IÂ´ve seen my share of blood in the field. If you can manage, IÂ´ll go with the others making sure the ships are ok"

**Dlir: Glad to be alive.****Red-Eye: Mechanical Limbo.**
Dlir watches the joy on the faces of the Wookies and how they fawn all over Arty. Dlir puts his weapon away and looks around. Upon seeing Deel in good hands, Dlir begins to relax.
He looks to his fallen droid. "Sigh. Could someone help me drag Red-Eye back to the ship?"
"I'm sure there are other ideas here," Dlir looks at the cages and wears an expression of deep disgust "but I want to see this place slagged." He keeps looking at the cage.

Daxxon doesn't look away as does what he can with his surgical tools "Do whatever you have to and keep everyone else away, I mess up he dies..."
Daxxon pauses and looks up at Jordan and sighs "Deel will be fine but we need to leave as soon as the ship is ready then I can treat anyone else who is hurt after he is stable."
Daxxon then continues working on Deel and ignores the rest of the world for the time being until he is done.

Jordan nods and starts to walk away. After a few steps, he stops and looks back at the kneeling medic, apparently cut off from the rest of the world.
"DonÂ´t worry, you wonÂ´t screw up. You can do it"
Moving away from Daxxon, he moves past Arty and her new friends.
"LetÂ´s go"

At first Biardi is a little concerned for Arty's safety but hearing her laughter reassures him. Still he's too concerned about Deel's condition to get much enjoyment from the happy sight. He heads over to the twi'lek making sure he's not in Daxxon's way. Biardi doesn't say much but he's ready to help in whatever way he can.
He doesn't mean to be rude to Dlir, but right now he just wants to make sure Deel is ok. Everything else can wait.

## Re:Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2008-12-08 18:08:44)

Jax takes out the repulsar gurney and unfolds it and gets it prepped waiting for Deel to be stabilized. A couple of wookies help Dlir pick up Red eye and haul him back to the ship. Daxxon has Deel patched up and stabilized. He and Jax load him onto the stretcher and start moving him towards the ship.
After a while the ships a prepped and ready for launch. Jax will pilot the ghtroc frieghter while the crew sticks with the voidstalker.

After Daxxon makes sure Deel is secure and comfortable he uses the comm in med bay of the Void Stalker "Anyone else who is injured please report to Med bay once you are able."
Daxxon takes a seat on a Supply Crate by the wall and looks at the Monitor for any changes to Deel's Status then he looks down and see his hands are stained with blood as well as his sleeves of his Jumpsuit but despite this quite stare at the crimson he thinks of all the times he has had blood on his hands, the times in vain and like Deel the times of success....yet he still feels no comfort for the one person he couldn't save..."I'm so sorry Valery..." he is oblivious to anyone in the room, unless they should speak to him...

**Dlir: Living it large in the VD** 
**Red-Eye: Mechanical dirt-nap on the VD**
Dlir thanks the Wookies in his best Common and non-verbal (in case any of them speak it even partially) lots of pats and nods, emulating their behaviour as best he can manage then assists in them getting to quarters (OOC Assuming they are staying on the VD for the trip?). Dlir is happy to give up his if they are comfortable there. Given their recently liberated status he wouldn't be suprised if they prefered the open space of the cargo bay (no locked door or bars).
Dlir pulls out his kit to asess Red-Eyes condition. After the armour plate is removed, to his dismay, he sees the extent. The torsos main power relays and back-up are revealed to be a slagging heap, easily removed thankfully, but not so easily replaced.
He turns to get started and strains his injury. With a gasp and a hiss he curses his combat ineptness. *If only I was abetter fighter…* thinking on the smears that were his friends.
> &quot;Anyone else who is injured please report to Med bay once you are able.&quot;

Says to an intert and inanimate object (Red-Eye) "Be right back buddy, I'll have you fixed up when I can." and heads to the medical bay, holding his hand to his side with a flinch and a curse.

Getting the wookies loaded on the ships, JordanÂ´s mood begins to lighten a little. While he canÂ´t understand a word theyÂ´re saying, it shows only too well how appreciative the wookies are of him and his friends for their help. However, once they gets into hyperspace, heÂ´ll feel a lot better.
Not really caring where the wookies makes room for themselves, he still has his place right on the main hold. He lays his rifle to the side, and allows himself to sit down for a moment of rest. Then he moves out to check that his turret is still functional. They may need it yet.
Passing through the halls of the ship, he runs into Dlir. The sullustan is clutching his side but seems to have at least recovered from the shock of battle.
"Hey there. You ok?"

## Re:Wookie-pops

### **Rebaav** (2008-12-09 10:17:33)

Dlir: Lost in thought en route to the Medical Bay.
Red-Eye: Boxed up for now. Systems on emergency battery.
Dlir starts from his mood and smiles at Jordan. "Just on my way to see Daxxon for some tender attentions. When our position got hosed I got sprayed by Red-Eyes guts. Burned and cut. Nothing too bad I think, just bruised pride." Chuckles and winces. "Skin pulling a little."
Not wanting to dwell on the soon to be dealt with, "The Wookies seem happy" Dlirs expression softens noticably. "Nice to see." Looks thoughtful for a moment. "I don't suppose anyone got any computers or data feeds from the Slavers? Client lists? Suppliers? Any associations at all? It's hard to interrogate a corpse." Poorly hid expression of satisfaction.

"YouÂ´d have to check that with Deel...IÂ´m not sure if anyone else tried getting anything of those computers. ItÂ´s possible the captain had them loaded onto the ship so we can look at them later"
Tracing a line along the mark from the cut he received upon their breach of the station, he seems to drift of in thought for a moment. Then he looks back at Dlir.
"It has been some time since I was acting this much on the frontline, but I guess some things you never forget hot to do. DonÂ´t worry about your pride, just make sure nothing else gets hurt and youÂ´ll be fine. You donÂ´t seem like a veteran soldier, but I can assure that youÂ´ll see more than your share of combat with us, so youÂ´ll better get used to it"

Once the ships are prepped and ready to go Jax calls a short confrence call over your comlinks.
"Ok listen up people, the wookies will be in the hold on both ships there are that many of them. Arty make sure that computer we liberated from the trandos is safely stored away on the VS. Antur your in charge of the my baby, I will fly the ghtroc. Jordan your gonna be with me as a co-pilot Biardi your in your usual spot at the helm of the *Voidstalker*. Once we get back to base Daxxon get the wounded transferred to medbay for recovery. Arty and Deel..."

"Arty get me a damage report from our fight with the lizards and get to work on repairs. Anyone got anything for me before we go?"

Jake helped out as much as he could. The repulsor gurney helped Dax with the work he was doing on their fallen teammate. Experience in the field of having team members fall in battle Jake takes things in stride. With a simple question to Dax to find out how Deel is doing Jake pats Dax on the back.
As things were getting squared away Jake headed over to his fighter and gave her a once over.
Once inside the fighter they all got a call over the comm form Jax. Jake continued his preflight as The Captain talked.
"Roger, VS3 had two lit and green. Ready when the rest of you all are. Nice work today all. Makes me glad to be a Voidstalker." From the inflection in Jakes voice the others could tell he was smiling.

Arty nods her head and runs off to the Voidstalker, waving to a few wookiees as she passes. She was on her way to first check on the computer and then to get a damage report for the captain. She didn't like him flying with so little of the crew with him, but he had the wookiees and Jordan, and..on a more selfish note that ment he couldn't bother her and Antur during the flight home. She grins at the idea, a light skip entering her run; though if he got hurt while she wasn't there she'd kill him.

Entering the ship Antur calls out to XO "Hey buddy I need your help." Nodding at the little droids series of beeping acknowledgement Antur replies "Yea um we need to take a look at that piece of junk over there see if we can get it off the ground."
After watching the little miracle droid do his thing Antur lets out a whistle at the droids speed. "Great work." Patting XO`s dome Antur head out and reports to Jax.
"Sir yes sir. The void one will be safe with me you have my word." Antur salutes Jax then takes the chair.

"Jax to Voidstalker I am ready to make the jump to hyperspace as soon as X0 relays his coordinates for sycronized jump."

Arty was currently skipping about the halls of the voidstalker on her way to find Antur. She had replayed earlier that the computer was safe on board and the damage report for the crew. She had been spending the pre-flight and some of the time after with the wookiees, but now she was on the hunt for her Antur. The mission had been their first together after..well..everything that happened to them and she had underestimated how it would feel seeing someone she lo..liked..liked very much in danger.

Lets have a systems check run I want to be ready in case we get any surprises along the way." Smiling Antur poke at the wound on his shoulder. "I have to get this checked out.

Heading to the med-bay Antur stumbles into Arty. Lately with the mission coming first it has seemed as she was so far away, damn war! When this hell is over, Antur smiles thinking of that time.

Trip goes by quickly as you talk to the wookies and try to gain more information. Deel is recovering nicely. The wookies seem to believe they were all being gathered together to be shipped to the same buyer. Deel being on bed rest spends his time hacking into the computer that was liberated from the trandos. The information on it is most enlightening.
It seems the wookiees are being sent to a sub arctic mine on Bandomeer. After some searching he finds some basic info on Bandomeer.
Bandomeer was a mining world dominated by the Offworld Mining Corporation. The planet was at one time an agricultural world of rolling plains until it was discovered that many valuable ores were hidden in its crust. Then, mining operations such as Offworld Mining took control, and reduced it to strip mines and industrial wastes. The planet was the homeworld of the Meerian race, who struggled to come to terms with the prosperity that cost their world's natural beauty. Even Bandomeer's surrounding asteroids were rich with mineral deposits, but could not be mined due to the risk of fragments colliding with the planet.

Thought we'd lost you Deel, no computer is worth more than your life ok? You may have a new computer to play with, but, that was a hard scare..."
She moves and wraps her arms around him in a hug "We're a family and a team, so cheer up, any repremand that papa Jax gives is one he has to give, and one to let each of us know we are cared for you know?"
She grins as she pulls back "You don't wanna know how many times he's yelled at me about something stupid I did."

Antur laughs at the doc`s joke. "No I am too smart to disagree with Arty, and too captivated by her beauty to want to." Antur throws Arty a sly wink at that last remark. Antur sits as Daxxon suggests and removes his shirt so that the wound can be attended to.
"Yea Jax can be hard at times but I do not think he would still be doing this if he did not care. But I for like the comfort of your shirt, though I am glad that's all I am wearing of yours today." Antur winches a little as Daxxon goes about the wound on his arm.
"After this we should check the passengers then back to the bridge."

Deel smiles and blusses. "Ya I know. Of course it will be nice to get back to my engine room on the Viodstalker. I also want to look over the ship we found might be of use sometime. Of course I will have to wait until the good doctor here says it is ok." Deel watches his friends leave to handle some problem or another. With that Deel returns to working on the computer.

**Dlir: Thankful for painkillers in the MedBay
Red-Eye: …**
> &quot;What hit your side Dlir, I doubt it was Blaster Fire as last I saw of you you were ducking for your life&#8230;.&quot;

"Sigh. Red-Eye got gutted and I caught his entrails. Mainly casing I think, it's the charged capacitants gel in an open wound I thought I should have someone more skilled at fleshwork than me have a look at." Winces. "It's starting to burn a little."
> &quot;You&#39;re a little worse for ware but you seem alright. Was that your first time in a combat zone?&quot;

"Not the first time but once your on the losing side it's... harder... I don't like things near me exploding."
> as for Dlir&#8230;he learned that droids make for poor hiding places for cover.&quot;

Dlir starts to shrug then thinks better of it "Some people bring knives to a gun fight," grunts with the strain on his side lifting his shirt over his head "I bring a B2. He's saved my life more than once before. Once is usually enough for most people. Besides, it's easier to patch him than me." checks to see if Daxxon catches the appreciation.
> &quot;Well Dlir, if you&#39;d like any help putting Red-Eye back together I&#39;ve got nothing but time till we leave hyperspace.&quot;

"Thank you Biardi, I was headed to my quarters to see to that right now. I was meaning to ask about what you would like to see done to the Y-wings. That will give us a chance... do you know where they keep the spare parts around here?" Eyes Deel with a smirk.
Dlir hops down and nods thanks to Daxxon, pulling his neck as he tries both at the same time. With a flinch and a mumble about feeling tired he walks to the door rubbing his neck. Stopping there smiles at the other banter and says to Daxxon "If you need any equipment or supplies for the medbay" nods to Daxxon "or anything else" nods to Deel" or even have a wish list of any kind let me know & I'll see what I can do." Dlir thinks he really should ask Jax for a ship manifest. Anticipate needs before they become stymied deeds and all that.
Nice not to be shot at for a spell, he thinks as he relaxes for this first time in months.

As for where we're going, we're heading back to base, from there you'll be escorted to a transport with a course towards Shiiriwook."

Deel was relived to be out of the medbay and still in one piece. He makes his way to his quarters to change into his utilitys to head to the engine room to check things out there.
As he walks into the engine room to start his checks and make sure everything is the way he left it. Grabbing his tools as he walks in he sees Biardi picking up parts for something. "Hello Biardi, is there something I can help you with?" Deel is just wondering if he needed help fixing what ever problem he might have. After all he spent part of the trip back in bed and recovering from his wounds.

## Re:Wookie-pops

### **Rebaav** (2008-12-16 15:24:35)

Dlir: Snooping around the Engine Room with Biardi
Red-Eye: ZzZzZz in Dlirs quarters.
"Thanks for the heads-up, I don't recall getting a crew manifest, or any manifest when I came on board. That was badly rushed, I almost missed you guys at the hanger, so it's totally expected. I've been trying to play catch-up since and am feeling a little winded." *As in winded because I've been on the run…* Dlir looks over a motivator, satisfied, puts it in a shoulder bag.
"I'm more of a facilitator. I help get people what they need so they can get something done. Being the one doing the doing is a little new." At that moment XO makes a noise, possibly in freindly greeting. Dlir starts suddenly like he'd just been slapped and his mood darkens considerably. "Though it's not the first time." a low suddenly chilled voice.
Dlir exits the Engine room, passing XO with a cool "Pardon me." and a forced smile at Deel heads to his quarters, as arranged with Biardi, at an almost run. When he gets there he tosses the shoulder bag to a cot and sits with his legs crossed and closes his eyes. His breath is shakey and forced. *That's what you get for relaxing fool. Just like last time.*

## Re:Wookie-pops

### **Valheru** (2008-12-16 15:43:24)

Biardi turns to the little droid, surprised by the hostile greeting. 'I guess XO's still not used to me' he thinks. Trying to smile reassuringly he tells the droid, "Oh don't mind us we're just getting some parts to fix Red-Eye."
When Deel enters the room Biardi grins, "Hey Deel, glad to see you up and about." He indicates the box of parts in his hands, "Red-Eye didn't fair so well this mission either, but we're about to get him fixed up. I'm sure Dlir wouldn't mind more help if you wa-". He cuts off abruptly as Dlir all but dashes from the room. Recovering slightly but still featuring a confused expression on his face, the duros ammends his statement, "Well, uh, at least I think he wouldn't mind more help."

*Docking area.* 
Jake shut down his fighter as it finished docking with VS1. He bird was still in good shape. The only scratch on it was from an asteroid the came out of nowhere and tagged him. It wouldn't take long to fix between the talented crew.
*We have a good team here. Even Dlir when he gets up to speed on things. Though I'm kind of surprised that they would put such a green horn when it come to combat in this unit. Oh well with some time he'll either get up to speed or get dead. Hopefully it's the former.* Jake thought to himself as he exited the Y-wing.
He took off his flight suit and hung it in the locker and retrieved his belongings. Everything went back to it's normal place. Even his blaster.
He looked around and saw Antur head off. *Probably in search of Arty. Not that a guy can blame him.* He chuckled and smiled to himself.
*Ships "Common" area*
He made his way to his quarters dug out his data pad and went to what went for the ships "common" area. He sighed as he sat down in the seat and activated the pad. He began to detail the mission as it pertained to him and his actions during the fight outside the station and inside. He saw some of the others walk by and gave them a nod or a "Hey good job today" and went back to his report. He knew that Command didn't really need it but it was a way for him to go over what he did and maybe try and find a better way to do what he did.
*Cargo hold* 
It had been a long day and he remembered that the wookies had had a longer one. Tucking the data pad into his pocket he headed to the hold As he entered he heard Arty mentioning about food and water.
Shaking his head as he forgot about that also he raised his voice form the door. "I'll get the water if someone wants to help with whatever we have for food. I'm not sure if it will be enough though."

Times passes quickly on the ships as they head for the rendezvous spot. Deel, Dlir, and Biardi manage to get Red eye functional and online again. Arty and Antur make googly eyes at each other for most of the trip. Jordan and Jax play a lot of sabbacc Jax begins o think that Jordan may be cheating but doesn't say anything about it. The ships are met by a Action IV bulk frieghter named *Liberation* The ships dock and off load the wookies. A few days pass as the intel you recovered is gone over and examined thoroughly. The ghtroc freighter is now being used to help wookies instead of enslave them.

She glances behind her to see if Antur was following; she had woken him up, but she wasn't sure if he actually *woke* up. Still she enters the room and heads straight to her normal chair beside the captain, head falling to her arms on the table with another yawn and a "morning."

It was just one of those things that happened to him once in a while. Thoughts of his father kept him awake. His birthday was coming up soon. That day was always a sad one for him. He shook his head. *Come on Jake. Mission time now. No need for distractions. You can take care of it later.*

Jax has a seat and presses a button and a holo-projection of a planet appears.
"Bandomeer is a mining world until recently it was own in effect by Off-world Mining corporation. The Empire has recently absorbed the cooperation for the good of the Empire."
The planet zooms in to a location on the southern ice cap.
"According to the info Deel pulled from the slavers computers this is where the wookie slaves were being delivered. There is records of an old mine in the area but it was reported as mined out years ago and closed down. It seems the Empire might have re-opened it. Antur your gonna take the Ghtroc frieghter and use its landing codes to infiltrate the base along with the rest of the squad. Your will have to recon the area and see what your dealing with since we have been unable to locate any more data on the mine or its facilities."

Arty watches the little holo-planet with growing interest "We're going to an Ice Cap?" Her lips press in a line in thought, did she have anything warm? she sighs "I hate snow..." she mumbles, she hated being cold. Last time she and Jax had gone to an Ice world was for a vacation of sorts with the old crew.
She had spent nearly the entire time in her room, huddled under the blankets with the heat going all the time. The only time she left had been when Jax had coaxed her out with promises of new tools and a new tool box. She had made an appearance then outside, it was short, and the crew had laughed till they cried at the sight of her bundled in ever warm clothing she had and few items she had "borrowed" from Jax.
Shaking her head slightly to return to the present meeting, she looks to the others around her for their reactions. *I hate cold*

"I guess I should go over the ship then. I have been wanting to get abetter look at her anyway." Deel trys to cover his excitement about having something new to play with. "I will have to get it ready for the cold and we will need some cold weather gear. I can also check over the rest of the gear to make sure it is ready."

Jake listened to the mission outline. The fact that there was little to no intel on the area bothered him. He didn't doubt the capabilities of the team but going in with nothing to go on was like facing down a rancor with hold-out blaster.
As he was thinking Antur asked a question. Jake waited for Jax to answer before speaking up.
Jake nodded at Jax. "Is this a stealth and recon operation or stop the operation permanently? We don't know who or what and how many are there. Are there other slaves there that would need to be liberated? What are our plan in calling backup in case we really step in the poodoo?"

"Your mission for right now is just to recon the facility. If it looks feasible you are authorized to attempt a rescue. I will be standing by with the Void stalker for back-up and an evac. The Ghtroc is being repaired as we speak and should be ready to go in the next few hours."
Jax pulls up some nav data and several blips show up around the planet.
"The empire has automated detection system in place around the planet. That is why we have to use the Ghtroc because its transponder has been programmed with the access encryption."

Arty watches the captain stand and turn them over to Antur, looking to her pilot she smiles at him.  Giving his hand a light squeeze while asking "So, what's the plan for now?"

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **master_Tru** (2009-01-05 17:42:17)

Antur moves over to the front of the room. Looking around he try`s to hide how out of place he feels. Thinking to the previous mission and seeing the tired look on everyone's face Antur begins. "If all goes as ... planned this will be a simple recon in and out. Deel will be checking over the ship and overseeing its repairs Arty can you give him a hand with that? Daxxon see what you can do about ensuring medical supplies and provisions for the ship. Dlir your on munitions which will include survival gear do what you can, Jake your with Dlir. Lets get our jobs done and then R and R. If we finish up quickly we can meet back here and see what this place has to offer for entertainment."
Antur clears his throat and nods to Jax. "I will help you all out when and where I can." Antur smiles "Any questions?"

Arty smiles as she watches him, yes she probably should have had a more respectable pose then resting her head on her hand with what could only be described as 'googly-eyes' at Antur but she couldn't really think on that..she was too busy thinking how good he looked while being uncomfortable.

### **ganthet** (2009-01-05 21:18:36)

As Deel interts the main hanger, he sees that there flurry of activity as techs move hee and there get ships ready and checking over ones that had just arrived. He heads to the gthoc, looking over the ship as he moves toward it. He can't belive that he had such little time to get her ready but that is the nature of the beast.
He walks up the boarding rampand makes his way to the enginering section. Putting his gear away and taking off his side arm and stowing it and the blaster rifle he never used, he starts in on seeing waht is left to check over. Pulling out his comm link he comms the deck officer to see where they stood on the repairs. "Deck Officer this is Lt. Deel, I need a status report on the gthoc the Voidstalkers brought in with them." He did mean to to just jump in and take over the repairs but if his hide was going to be on the line he wanted to make sure he was going to get home in one piece.

Daxxon nods to Antur as he gets up, showing he understands his orders. He makes his way to the Medical to gather up what he needs, refilling his Medkit with 6 Medpacs and making sure he has all his tools sterilized. He catches one of the Medic Droids watching him "If you ain't to busy would you mind buzzing the Supplies officer for me and let him know I need some provisions for a Ice like environment and some recon gear if possible....." looking up at the Medical Droid "...don't worry about the Medical Supplies I will fill out the paper work later when i get back." Daxxon thinks to himself ~If I live that is~

Deel repairs seem to be going fine the ship was only hit with ion fire so it only needed some electrical work to be back at full operational capacity.
**Location:** *Supply*
*Jake Daxxon*
Daxxon meets up with Jake on his way to the supply room after looting medical for his other supplies. A young fresh faced recruit is behind the counter reading a data pad and looking over a dismantled rifle.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Yogi** (2009-01-09 08:18:23)

OOC: Daxxon is getting medical supplies.  Dlir was supposed to be with Jake at supply.  But maybe the three us can gather the gear.
**Location:** Briefing room
Antur handed out the assignments.  Jake and Dlir were assigned to munitions and equipment.  Jake smiled.  Being on gear gathering duty usually meant you could get the good stuff before the others.    "Roger that."  He looked at Dlir.  "You ready?  I want to make sure that we're not going to freeze."  He stood up and made for the door. before he left he looked back at Antur.  "When we have the gear one of us will comm you and let you know we're ready."
**Location:**  Supply
Jake and Dlir had just arrived at supply when they saw Daxxon come around the corner.  Jake gave a wave and looked at the fresh faced recruit that looked like he was just out of boot.  Jake smiled.  "Morning Private.  We need some munitions and cold weather gear can you help us out with that?"  Jake made sure to be friendly.  Being friends with the supply guys usually made things easier for those that needed the gear as they were more likely to go the extra mile to help out.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-09 11:22:30)

With nothing further to add, Jordan decided to tag along with the guys going to the supply. He had made a mental note of things that he had missed during the latest assignment, and he would try to see if he could obtain them. While Jake talked to the guy in charge, he looked around, searching for the things he needed.

### **zerah** (2009-01-12 14:03:58)

Arty works away with Deel, helping where she could with making sure both ships were up and ready to go.  Walking out of the Voidstalker with a datapad in hand she murmurs quietly to herself about possible new parts later down the line.  Moving towards their newest ship she dodges various people and droids all while still looking to her datapad.  "Hey Deel! what else needs to be done on these two?"

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-12 16:30:31)

Walking into the hangar, Jordan spot sight of Arty over by the two ships. He picks up his pace a bit and gets up to the ships.
"How are things going, you guys need a hand?"

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2009-01-12 16:35:14)

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2009-01-13 10:19:08)

There has been no sign of X0 anywhere in the hanger or on either ship.; You do spot the gungan , Mar San Teeples, you rescued lurking around the hanger bay trying to stay out of the way of everyone. The Ghtroc appears to be almost ready to go, it just needs a pre-flight inspection and some fuel and it should be good to go thanks to Deel's leadership of the repair crew.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **ganthet** (2009-01-13 10:42:43)

Deel pops his head out of hatch on the gthoc. "Atry, this one is ready. Just pre-flight and some fuel and where golden." Deel finishes hiswork grabing his tools and heading down to the flight deck with his team mates. "I would like to check over the Viod 1,2,3 also. If the captain is going to be using them? Also either of you guys seen XO anywhere? He is usally always with the Voidstalker." Deel is conserned that there might be something wrong with his friend. Picking up his commlink Deel calls XO. "XO where at buddy?"

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-13 10:44:46)

"No, I havenÂ´t seen him. But IÂ´m sure heÂ´ll turn up. Maybe we should install a droid caller on him"
As he prepares to go into the ship, he spots the gungan entertainer, hanging around the hangar. Poiting to him, he turns to Arty.
"HowÂ´s your new friend doing?"

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **zerah** (2009-01-13 14:03:02)

Arty shakes her head "Not really sure, seems to have gotten busy lately so I've left him be."  Glancing over to the other mechanic she grins at him "Yea I'd really like to make sure that the Captain's gonna be okay without us there on the ship with him.  As for X0..I was wondering the same thing."

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Frost** (2009-01-13 14:07:52)

The gungan spots Arty and Jordan and starts walking over towards them with big floppy steps. He trips on a wrench that a mechanic was using and stumbles backwards into a cargo crate. He gets his butt stuck in the cargo box but manages to get back on his feet with the box stuck to his rear.
"Meesa could use a lil help please."

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-13 14:16:13)

Leaning closer to Arty, Jordan whispers.
"No, he could use a *lot*  of help..."
Walking over to the gungan, he helps him to remove the box.
"There you go. Long time no see, how are you doing?"
((BTW, my characters name is *Jordan*. I think thatÂ´s the second time you wrote Jake, Frost  <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->))

Antur finishes his rounds checking the supply room the hanger bay floor and within the ... ship. Antur strolls out of the ship back on to the hanger floor and smiles at his friends. Feeling a little lazy for not actual helping as much with the repairs as he would have in the past Antur waves at his crew. Making sure the work is done is just as important he keeps thinking to himself. Still he absent mindiedly picks up a few tools and puts them away. "Hello all." Anur smiles and winks at Arty "Hello love. We should be just about ready for our mission."

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Yogi** (2009-01-15 15:27:52)

Jake finished stowing the all the cold weather gear that had been given to them for the mission.  The cold weather didn't suit him well.  Hopefully with the gear he would be warm enough.  Even though he was used to the coldness of space actual cold weather was a different story.  Maybe it was just the thought of the biting wind that bothered him.  Either way they should be in and out quick. 
He made way for the ships exit wishing they could just fly in the fighters but he knew that wasn't in the mission specs.  Arriving at the ramp he spotted most everyone that was in the Stalkers.  He walked down the gangplank.  "Well the gear from supply is secured aboard.  It'll be ready for us when we get there."  He looked at Antur.  "How long do you think it will be till we get going?"

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **ganthet** (2009-01-15 16:19:09)

Deel looks over at his friends as they try help the gungan with remove the box from his foot. Smiling he moves back over to the ships to continues his checks and fueling the ship. "Captain i am going to check over Voidstalker 1,2,3 make sure they are ready incase you need them for something. Also have you seen XO anywhere?"  Deel directs the tech helping him to start fuel the gthoc and he moves inside to work on per-flight.

"Everything is ready but pre-flight and I want to go over the our ships make they are all ready incase the Captain needs them." Deel looks at the gthoc kind of saddly. "She ain't the Voidstalker but she'll do. The techs are fueling her now."

## Re: Wookie-pops

Antur embraces Arty for a short time almost forgeting her request. Shaking his head "Not sure if I could say no, besides we could use all the help we can get. Not sure what we can do for quarters and no he is not sharing with us." Antur throws Arty a sly wink.
Antur takes Deel`s data pad "Great work thats, get those preflights going then check back with me."

## Re: Wookie-pops

Deel smiles and mockingly salutes Antur. "Yes, sir. I will report to you when I am finished. Arty I will see you in abit when Antur is done briefing you on whatever it is that he has in mind." Deel turns to leave. "If anyone wants to help with pre-flight it would be welcome. Besides I think Arty needs to talk statagie with our fearless leader." Deel loves poking fun at his freinds. In turth he is happy for them that they found something speaicl in these darktimes.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Valheru** (2009-01-20 16:00:33)

Having not been assigned anything at the briefing Biardi has been somewhat aimless. So when Deel asks for help checking out the squadron's ships the duros jumps at the chance. "I'd be happy to help Deel. Let's get started while these two...strategize." Biardi smiles at the couple, though he doubts they have eyes for anything but each other at the moment, and heads off to the ships.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **ganthet** (2009-01-21 15:27:12)

"Sure Biardi, I was going to start on the gthoc frist and then check out the other ships." Deel points over to the Voidstalker and the two Y-wing fighters setting next to it. "It is nice to have someone else interested in taking care of our eqiupment." Deel smiles it was nice to have someone to help him out.

---

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Yogi** (2009-01-22 09:43:39)

Jake grins and shakes his head at Antur and Arty.  While he is happy that they managed to find something decent and loving amid these troubling times he wished that when on duty things could be a bit more professional.  Around the squad it isn't so bad but it's how others outside the squad might view the lack of professionalism that bothers him.  They have a good crew together.  *I'd hate to see it be taken apart do to romantic relationships being on display*  He thought to himself.
Hearing Deel's request for preflight help Jake also nods.  "I'll help out also Deel.  Not checking on your own fighter is like asking to get your ticket punched."  Seeing a look form the two he explained.  "It's what my dad always used to say.  That way if anything ever went wrong there would be no one to blame but yourself."  He shrugged.  The thought of his dad brought back some good memories of the two of them working on his dads ship together.

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Yogi** (2009-01-27 08:21:17)

Jake makes his way to the cockpit after stowing his gear.  The feel of the ship was different than VS1.  He still felt more at home in his fighter where he had himself and his wingmen to count on.  Leaving the flying to someone else was like letting someone else be in control of your destiny.  He took a breath and let it out as he entered. 
He nodded to Antur.  "Where you want me skipper?"

Antur smiles at Deels joke and replies through the comm "It is to you to keep her together. Would hate it if you had to push us all the way there." Chuckling Antur turns to Biardi "Why don`t you take a little rest and relax I want to fly her non-stop you will have to take a shift at the helm later. Jake you have the first shift plot a course we are about to depart." With no imediate answer from Jax Antur opens the main comm again. "OK team we are about to launch I hope you are all ready.

"First shift, roger that."  Jake smiled as he hopped into the pilots chair.  "Finally we're getting somewhere." 
Jake began to go over the controls to get a quick run down.  He had never flown a Gthroc before but light freighters were pretty stock.  With a flick of a switch he brought the navcomputer up.  and began to run the calculations for the jump to their destination. 
"Should have coordinates in a few skipper."  Jake said as the numbers came back on the navcomp.  "Looks like we have a solution.  Entering the coordinates now."  With a few taps of the keys the data was entered and ready to go. 
He looked over his shoulder and grinned.  "Ready when you are."

"Take us out Jake. Full speed lets see what she can do."  Antur says from behind him.  a grin appears on his face.  Even though Antur can't see it his friend can hear the humor in his voice.  "Roger.  I'll try not to breaker her on her first outing." 
Activating the repulsors he lifted the freighter off the flight deck.  In a moment he got his clearance from flight control.  "Roger control."  He edged towards the magnetic field that kept the coldness of space out and the atmosphere of the flight deck in. 
As he came close to the field he activated the shipwide comm.  "Deel you ready back there?  We're going to see what she can handle."  As they were passing the field he came back on again "Hold on people."  the ships inertial compensators were dialed up to about 95%.  So the jolt wasn't going to be too bad. 
"Lets see what this hunk of junk can do."  Jake pushed the throttles all the way forward.  Not like he would in his fighter but almost as fast.

The gtroc freighter handles a bit like a drunken hutt but she does have a little speed to her. X0 beeps that he has the nav data entered into the hyperdrive and we can jump when you are ready.

" I'm ready just remeber Arty gets space sick easy so.." Deel smiles to himself he knew Arty didn't get space sick and with Jake's flying you got cured fast anyway. "Don't push it to hard Jake. I would hate to have something blow before the mission starts." Deel goes back to checking ready outs and ajusting stuff.

ooc:The trip will take about 3 days in hyperspace. You cans can rp as much as you want just let me know when you are ready to arrive and I will fast forward to Bandomeer. If you guys want to do any skill checks just use my take 10 rule we discussed. The gungan didn't make it back to the ship before you guys left so the only npc on board is X0.

As the ship took off, you could see on Jordan that he was a bit relived. He walked took a place in the main area on the fighter, and sat down to look over his equipment as well as attatch the new scope he had gotten to his rifle. Looking over to the cockpit, he called out to the others.
"Hey guys, whatÂ´s our ETA?"

Deel spends his time between his dutys and reading the tech maniels he brought with him. As Dlir and Deel work on the ship and discuss about mechanics and enginering he gets the feeling that he was passing on what he had learned. Thinking to himself *"This is what my mom must have felt like when see was teaching classes."*
Deel rambles on about the ship and other things that interest him not wanting to bore his friend, but is glad someone is interested in these things as much as he is.

Jake could hear the whine and the shudder from the ships engines.  He was pushing them pretty hard but how else could he put her through a little test.  The jests among his squad mates made him smile a bit.  "Roger Arty make you hate it.  Will do."  When he began to hear a slight protest he held up his hands.  "Only kidding." 
With the jump into hyperspace the crew had some time.  "This will be a monger trip than normal."  He said turning around.  "Would have been just over a day in VS1. Three days in this contraption.  I hope someone brought along some cards."

Arty pouts at Jake, sticking her tongue out at him "yea yea, so three days on this thing?"  she sighs, leaning back against the wall "Hope it doesn't fall apart on us.."  she looks around wearily, she may have trusted Deel to look over the hunk-of-junk but that didn't mean she didn't trust said hunk-of-junk to not fall apart.  Seeing that Antur was looking up something she moves to him and leans over to look.

"Well So far nothing has blown which is great. Everything checks out so far Antur. Has Arty gotten over her space sickness yet?" Deel leaves the commlink open to hear the responce he will get.
He continues to go over the readouts and ajusts things when needed. "I am heading to the mess to grab a bite anyone want to join me?" Deel links his datapad to the readouts and sets it to tell him if anything happens that shouldn't and heads to eat.

"Well this will have to do....I suppose there is an Irony somewhere in this going from being a Nobles Son in a luxurious home to a Medical Merc on a Smelly Rust Bucket of a ship...."

The three day trip goes by quickly. The alarm goes off letting you know that you will soon be dropping into realspace. A few moments later you arrive in the Bandomeer system. The imperial sensors give you a scan and your IFF transponder sends out its signal in response. After a few tense moments you receive clearance to approach the planet. It takes a few hours to make it to the planet and then ground control contacts you.
"*Kashyyk Express* this is Imperial Ground Control what is your destination and cargo?"

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Yogi** (2009-02-24 11:55:33)

Jake looked at Bardi. "If they have scanned us, and they probably have they will have an idea of how many are aboard. The slaves idea might not be a good one. Supplies on the other hand might work. Or we're here to pick up cargo to take out." He shrugged. "I'm surprised no one checked the hold to see what was in there."
OOC: Kinda funny that we don't know. I mean with all the checking over of the ship and all that was done we never set foot in the cargo hold.

Standing at the enginering station Deel checks over the power outputs and the rest of the systems. " Don't look at me guys I just fix stuff you break.

A new voice comes over the receiver. It sounds a bit nervous.
"This is ground control command *Kashyyk Express* we have received you Imperial transponder signal your flight plan is being transmitted to you at this time sorry for the delay.If you need refuel and restocking stop by the main starport when you are ready to leave."
A few seconds later the computer receives a nav data update and a flight plan through the atmosphere to a location near the southern pole of the planet.

As far as they are concerned we are just part of the empire.â€ Antur looks around to Biardi â€œCheck in with the rest of the crew are at battle stations. Jake fly casual â€¦.

A wave of relief hit Jake when they were cleared for landing. breathign a sigh of relief he followed Antur's orders. "Roger that skipper, flying casual." Jake inputted the coordinates that has been sent to him by the Imps and set the freighter on it's designated way.
When they were moving Jake turned around. "Something about this bothers me. We were let through with out any questions asked about cargo. Makes me wonder just who we are supposed to be and will thay be surprised to see us instead of the regular crew?"

## Re: Wookie-pops

### **Valheru** (2009-02-28 19:40:00)

### **ganthet** (2009-03-01 14:31:48)

"Well that went well. I am glad for whatever you guys said, cause dieing is something i am trying to avoid as of late." Deel checks over the readouts some more. "Everything is still in the green Antur. i can give you power for weapons and shields when ever you need it." Deel is glad that they where not getting blow to bits. That would have ended a great carer for him and he was just getting used to this life of his.

Arty and Antur have enjoyed their relationship for sometime now, and as it is still a young relationship Antur continuously finds himself surprised by Arty. Today is no different. Antur coughs as if caught off guard by Arty`s statement. At first only a simple â€œWow.â€ Escapes his lips. Antur looks around â€œWow I need a seat.â€ Realizing he is already sitting down Antur turns a shade of red. â€œI can defiantly help you with that later Arty. Umm â€¦.. yea â€¦. Ah how long until we land?â€ Antur sits there with the largest I am the luckiest guy in the galaxy smile over his face.

"So fearless leader are we going to bo blown out of the sky or has everything gone off without a hitch so far.

Sighing over the comm, Jordan couldnÂ´t help but think how much people could like to complicate things.
"Look, just land the damned ship. If we were supposed to carry wookies or other slaves, theyÂ´ll most likely have scanned the ship and noticed there are a little too few lifeforms on board. And if thatÂ´s the case, then they wonÂ´t kill us on sight, if they did, we wouldnÂ´t even have gotten this far. If weÂ´re supposed to carry something else, well they wonÂ´t know we donÂ´t have it until they look, now will they?"
