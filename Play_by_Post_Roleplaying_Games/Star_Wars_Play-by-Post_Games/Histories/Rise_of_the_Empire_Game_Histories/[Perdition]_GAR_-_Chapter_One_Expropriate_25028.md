It is a time of desperation for the Galactic Republic. Separatists forces have captured the planet Tirahnn,
shutting down a major source of much needed resources along the Perlemian Trade Route.
Sensing the urgency of the situation the Republic has prepared an invasion force to liberate the planet.
The Separatist forces present a daunting front, and more than brute force is necessary for victory.
In order to ensure victory, the Republic has prepared a plan to soften the planet&#39;s defenses ahead of the invasion.
This strike team will be the first to breach the Separatists&#39; defenses and will make way for the liberation of the world&#8230;

**Jorax** 
It’s been nearly a month since the Separatists came and easily took control of the world of Tirahn, the defense of the world pitifal and unprepared for the attack which came. Having safely retreated from the world, Jorax’s unit was soon reassigned and separated. Assigned to the mundane task of security aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyed, the Solidarity, one of the few ships still in the vicinity of the captured world, Jorax spends his days waiting for something to happen.
When the young man is about to give up and move on his way to the next job, Jorax receives orders to go with a pilot in a Theta-class shuttle and retrieve a few passengers and cargo. The journey itself is to last two days and seems to be on a tight time schedule.
The first stop is on a remote world even the pilot doesn’t seem to know the name of, just a designation afforded to the world by some scientist. The short glimpse the human gets of the world is of high mountains and trees to rival the ones of Kashyyk. A small landing area has been made, where already a small freighter is resting. Waiting nearby two figures stand nearby to it, but lift their gaze to the shuttle as it settles and the ramp opens. One of the figures approaches the shuttle, a bag tossed over the young woman’s shoulder. Before reaching the ramp she looks back at the man waiting beside the freighter, who gives her a nod before turning away, the noticeable glint of a lightsaber hilt catching the soldier's eye, and then disappears into the woods.
Having ascended the ramp the young woman gives Jorax a smile, “**Hello**,” she says brightly before tossing her bag into a corner of the hold, the sound making a loud clang as something metal inside hits the deck plating. No more then 18 years old, the sight of the lightsaber is an odd addition to the garb she wears. Unlike most Jedi Jorax has seen, she doesn’t wear the traditional robes of mute browns and beige. Instead she sports dark green trousers and a matching jacket under which he can spot a black top.
Her lightsaber is matched by a blaster pistol on her opposite and as she reaches out a hand for Jorax to shake he can see she’s wearing a lighter version of shockboxing gloves. “**I’m Marina Numa.**”

Jorax watches the girl board and, spotting her saber hilt, surmises she's some sort of Jedi - despite the obvious deviation in attire. He's never been one for keeping up with fashion, and function suits him over form anyway. Instinctively having rested a hand on one of his sidearms, Jorax relaxes as the young lady approaches.
*Well at least she won't be any trouble. Jedi tend to be pretty peaceful, unless given reason to show some of those amazing saber skills. How much experience can she have though?*
"**Jorax Okin,**" Jorax replies, rising from his seat to shake her hand, "**I wish I could tell you why you're here Marina, but then I don't know why I'm here either. I suspect we're just playing taxi for a few days. It's still more exciting than what I've been up to lately though.**" He motions to a nearby seat and sits back down, waiting for the pilot to takeoff. "**I've been working security ever since the Separatists took the planet of Tirahn, but it's been pretty boring.**"
Jorax adjusts the seat straps and settles into a comfortable posture, now turning his attention to the new passenger and taking her in for the first time.
"**I can see you and your friend both carry Jedi weapons, but I thought they had a stricter dress code…**" he nods at her dark green clothing with a slight smirk, eyebrows raised.

Following suit, Marina takes a seat next to Jorax. It's not long before the ramp is raised and the shuttle takes off again. With a laugh she begins the process of strapping herself into the seat for lift off. "**No I suppose I don't, but frankly there isn't a dress code, it's just a preference. Many Jedi revert to some semblence of their homeworld's fashions, if a bit simplified.**" With a bob of her head she indicates the ramp, "**Master Dray prefers wearing the attire of the places we go to. He thinks it makes the people we work with a bit more comfortable with our presence, particularly the ones who don't exactly like outsiders.**" Now settled, she starts to pull off the gloves as she looks down a lock of her untameable black hair falls from the pony tail she placed it in, absentley she sweeps it behind her ear. "**Security, huh? Would it happen to be on the *Solidarity*? That's where I've been summoned to.**"

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-02 22:21:06)

"**Yep, the *Solidarity* alright. Ever since we got off Tirahn things have been fairly uneventful. At least as far as I've seen. If they sent for a Jedi it could mean somebody's got a plan and that's just fine by me.**" Jorax pauses for a moment and glances out a viewport, the terrain pulling steadily away.
*Fine indeed. Those Separatist scum have got a lot to pay for, and I'll be first in line to collect.*
Turning back to Marina, Jorax begins: "**Well it took us two days to get to you, so we'll probably have some time before we reach our next destination. I suppose now's as good a time as any to get to know one another. My name's Jorax Okin and I was on Naboo when it was invaded,**" his right hand goes to the stone around his neck as he continues, "**…pretty much everybody knows when that was. From there I took whatever work was available, which started out as low-level security posts. Nothing too risky. As the months went by there was more demand for guys like me to guard convoys and serve as armed escort for the rich anxious types. I ended up attached to Republic forces, which is really what I was hoping for all along - a chance to retaliate for what happened to my home. That's what I was doing when we lost Tirahn. I was reassigned to *Solidarity* for a bit, then I was told to report to the shuttle bay. Other than some really uninteresting conversation with the pilot,** " Jorax smiles and projects his voice loud enough to be heard up front, "**…my day crawled by - until we picked you up. That's my *how*, now if you don't mind filling in a few pieces of your own maybe we can figure out a *why*. You said you were summoned, any indication as to who or for what purpose? Scuttlebutt was some sort of special squad was being assembled, but I just assumed it was going to be more…official.**"
*And by official I mean not some kid Jedi, but I suppose lightsaber cut up droids as good as anything else…*

"**Are you always this open with people you've just meet?**" The young Jedi asks with a hint of amusement in her tone. With a glance over at her newfound companion she tucks her gloves into her belt. "**The orders came from the Council. I was to await pickup from this shuttle to be taken to the *Solidarity*. From there, Master Elasra was to direct me,**" she pauses, listening to the hum of the shuttle for a moment as it made the jump into lightspeed. It was then she took off the safety harness, the buckles clinking as she let them fall aside. " **From the sounds of it, you know more about what's going on out that way than I do.**"
The Jedi Master Ezar Elasar was assigned to the *Solidarity* before the crisis began on Tirrahn. The Barabel Jedi has seemed to make it his responsibility to regain control of the crucial supply depot.

*I guess waiting this long hasn't killed me, a couple more days won't either.*
"**Hmmm. Well that's not much, is it?**" Jorax sighs, impatience becoming evident. "**I suppose we'll just have to wait it out.**"
He closes his eyes as his thoughts drift to better times for a few moments but, as always seems to happen, he finds it hard to dwell on the past for long. Not without considering the present. Jorax opens his eyes once more, addressing the Padawan opposite him in a more solemn tone:
"**You ever been in battle, Marina?**"
*Now there's something I do know a little bit about…*

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **Alicia** (2011-05-03 12:13:24)

Marina gives her companion a small smile in response to the frustration and his decision to wait. She doesn't say much more and when he opens his eyes again he sees that she's leaning back in the seat, her own eyes closed.
"**Mmhmm,**" she says in the affirmative, the sound drawn out as she too thinks back. "**Minor spats and then Geonosis.**" The last comes with a troubled sigh, many Jedi were lost that day, and it had only been the beginning. Her fingers had come to rest almost habitually at the thought upon her lightsaber. "**Nothing more since then, against the Separatists I mean.**" One eye squints open as she looks at him. "**Sorry, but it was nearly a two day hike back to that clearing…**" She left the rest unspoken as she closed her eyes again and shifted slightly in the seat.

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-03 12:33:38)

Jorax hears the meaning in her response, and let's Marina have her peace.
*I've heard some of what happened on Geonosis too, young Jedi. How could so many have lost so much and still be willing to fight? That's a testament to the good that exists in most folks I suppose. It's something battle droids won't ever understand, or their heartless masters for that matter. Yes, we've lost much. Somehow though, after this war is over, I think we'll see they've taken more than we realize.*
Content to pass the time with his thoughts, dark though they may be, Jorax leans back in his seat and wonders who else could have been called to the *Solidarity* and what the future holds for all of them.

**Kieran**
It's been a couple days since the order to return to Coruscant, and after being debriefed by the esteemed Jedi Master Agen Kolar was sent on his way to recuperate after this latest assignment. During the practice of a Cadence, the summons comes unexpectedly but the authenticity of the orders is unmistakable. The Jedi Council has ordered you to rendezvous with a Theta-class shuttle which will transport you to the *Solidarity* and from there you are to assist the Jedi Master Ezar Elasra. There isn’t much time to prepare, only an hour, before you are to meet with the shuttle at the designated pad just outside the Jedi Temple.
**Jor**
The last week has been nearly unbearable for the displaced Jedi. Separated from his mentor, the young man has been given much else to do but study and help where he can around the temple. The mission thought too dangerous for his participation required Jor's master to proceed on his own, and there has yet to be a publicized report concerning the mission's status. When the console indicates there's a message, the orders found there may be met with some disappointment.

**Jorax**
The day it took to get to the planet where Marina was picked up may have been the longest one in the trip. While the first several hours of the trip she spent in silence and deep meditation, once she was awake and rested, Jorax found her to be rather talkative should he have the mind to. It seemed almost impossible for the young Jedi to sit still for long. After awhile she had located her bag and pulled from it a strange looking contraption. A mix between a vocabulator and a commlink it was a strange combination of tech. Pulling from her belt a toolkit she got to work on it, happy to content herself with her work on it.
From up from the pilot indicates it will be another hour before arrival on Coruscant.

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-03 13:47:33)

Hearing the pilot's announcement, Jorax breathes a small sigh of relief. The trip with Marina had been uneventful in a general sense, though it was by no means inactive. The girl never seemed to stop moving. He was hopeful whoever was meeting them on Coruscant might have some clues as to what was going on, but it was unlikely.
*Well that's an interesting trinket…* he thinks to himself, watching her pull something from the bag she brought along. *The parts seem mostly familiar, but the configuration is odd.*
"**That doesn't happen to be some kind of Jedi super-weapon, does it?**" he asks, nodding at the strange device. "**Life sure would be easier with a couple of those around…**" he adds with a somewhat playful grin, picturing the Padawan leading her troops into battle wielding her saber in one hand and the mutant vocabulator in the other. The prospect of meeting some new crew has lightened Jorax's usually dark countenance once again, and some light conversation to pass the remaining minutes appeals to him.

### **Alicia** (2011-05-03 14:55:24)

**Jorax**
Marina's own playful grin rivals Jorax's as she holds up the device for him to see. "**It could be if battles could be won by talking someone's ear off.**" She turned it in her hand. "**It's the translator and vocabulator unit from a protocol droid. I've been trying to make a stand alone translator out of it, but I can't seem to get the programming right.**" With a shrug, she made a small tweak with the tool she had been using before flipping the switch. "***Haly***," she spoke toward the device, when nothing happened she made another small tweak before repeating. The resulting whine was earsplitting and only turned off when the young Jedi made yet another adjustment.
She looked up at her companion apologetically.

"**I don't know about droids, but that would probably do the trick against anyone else!**" Jorax replies, his voice slightly louder due to the ringing in his ears. "**Keep at it though, I'm sure you'll get it. I have no problem taking droids apart with my tools,**" his hand taps the holster on his left hip, "**…but I don't usually pick up the pieces afterwards.**"
Jorax gives a small chuckle at his own joke. He's never fully trusted droids, and that'll likely never change, but it's good to know not everyone is as cynical as he is.
"**What was that you said, *haly*? What language is that?**"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-03 16:02:45)

Making the last swing of his lightsaber, Kieran sent a silver stream of light trailing in its wake. Remaining in his final stance for a few moments he took a deep breath before deactivating the Jedi weapon. Replacing it at his belt, he wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead and sat down on one knee. He had been practicing a lot the last days, the short time he had been back on Coruscant, and he was starting to crave for action again. Though he had been reluctant to part with the troops he had been commanding, he had not questioned the summon from the Jedi Council bringing him back to the temple. The sieges they had been fighting were as good as won anyway, and he hoped that the fact that they were pulling Jedi from the front lines meant that the tide was finally shifting, or at least that the Grand Army had been able to retract itself from being stretched from the Core worlds to the Outer Rim.
He had a feeling something else was up though. He had been left much to his own doing since his return to the temple, and there had been no talk of shipping of to a new assignment. Not until recently anyway. He hadn´t been surprised when he was told that he was to assist master Elasra, and he was anxious to see in what way his assistance would be required. He wasn´t familiar with the name of the Jedi Master like he was with names such as Kenobi or Windu, but he suspected that whatever assignment they were headed for, Elasra would be qualified to handle it.
Using the Force to slowly levitate himself up to a standing position, he stroke away a strand of white hair from his face. No matter what, he was a warrior, and no matter what, he would not fail. Walking into the change room, he slipped out of his training gear and into the refresher. After emerging several minutes later, he donned the simple, white/beige Jedi robes he usually wore and headed off towards his chambers, to prepare for departure. As he didn´t know what awaited him, he decided against donning his armor, and instead tucked the plates, along with his Sun Guard blade, into a cloth roll. Having had the blade for a long time now, he had grown accustomed to its presence, but he still never let himself forget where he had taken it, and what it meant to him.
Throwing the pack on his shoulder, he headed for the landing pad where he was supposed to be picked up. He didn´t care he was going to be quite early, better to wait outside than in his quarters anyways, and perhaps someone he knew would pass by that he could chat up. After all, he had barely seen Coruscant since the war began.

Jor lept across his room when we saw the console light up, hoping it was word of his mentor, but to a degree of ambivalence he has being summoned elsewhere.
*'Anything's better than what they've got me doing here.'* He thought to himself, flicking through the countless artifacts he'd cataloged and researched on the console before logging off.
*'Why couldn't they just let me go on the mission with Master Incarna?'* His mind continued to wander as he gathered his things, strapping on his armour and slinging his rifle over his back. He shook his head, detaching himself from his thoughts and focusing on the mission at hand. *'Elasra…Elasra…'* His mind ticked over the name, sure he'd heard of it somewhere, but then again he had never been good with names: it could have been a plant back on Dathomir or a drink in one of the shadier establishments in the Outer Rim. *'I just hope he doesn't want me to do menial tasks, if I have to clean robes, it's probably going to be the final straw.'* He said jokingly to himself, having spent a large proportion of his life in servitude. Giving his quarters one last sweep with his eyes, he slipped out of the door.
He meandered down the labyrinthine passages towards the landing pad, shifting between the shadows cast on the ground. While he wasn't invisible, his body almost completely disappeared from sight while in the darkness, all that remained was the faint outline of his pale purple face's features and his vestigial horns.
Unlike most Zabrak and due to his upbringing he didn't have any *Jato* on his body, having never taken *Res Selenoren*. His master had mentioned something in passing that he would set him his challenges in the stead of his parents, being well versed in Zabrak culture, but it was all dependent on how the current situation progressed.
After a few minutes walk, the walls of the corridors opened up to reveal his rendezvous point in the distance, the infinite city of Corruscant sprawling over the horizon behind it.

**Jorax**
"**It's Ryl for visitor. My first teacher was a Twi'lek and it was practically all he spoke for that first year we were together. He cursed flently too, probably learned more than a 10 year old should have.**" Marina had gone back to work on the device, pausing for a moment as her train of thought seemed to shift. "**He was the surliest man I had ever meet and probably the kindest.**" Looking up for a moment at her companion she went back to her task, her tools working under her firm direction to correct the problem with the components' interfacing.
**Jor and Kieran**
Already being on the Temple grounds, the trip doesn't take long, though because of the size of the grounds it's perhaps a good thing they left when they did. With close to 20 minutes to spare, the two arrive close to the same time, the pad empty of all except some crates of supplies and a couple bulk loader droids hovering about to complete their task. The shuttle hasn't arrived yet each of the Jedi notice as they seem to fall into step with each other.

Walking across the large spaces of the Jedi Temple made Kiera feel kind of at home. He liked the open spaces where one could walk freely, in contrast to his recent time in life, where he seemed to be living in cramped field barracks and narrow trenches. He liked his freedom, to be able to do what he wanted, and he guessed the Temple served as a pretty good symbol for that. As he came closer to the landing pad, he shifted the weight from one shoulder to the other, and looked around.
Noticing nothing other than a couple of droids hovering about, he placed his pack on the ground and sat down next to it. He had known he´d be early, so he had decided to just relax until his transport arrived. After a few minutes, he noticed someone coming his way, and as a Zabrak made his way onto the landing pad, he raised his hand in a greeting.
**"You also here waiting for a ride? Seems like they haven´t gotten here yet"**

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-03 19:34:18)

As Jor made his way towards the landing pad, he spotted an Echani male sat on the ground next to his pack, and it didn't take long to process that he had been given a similar, if not the same request as him. As Jor made it up onto the landing pad he was greeted by the stranger, and so, as was customary, he responded:
**"I am indeed…"** He said pointing his thumb to the rifle over his shoulder. **"…either that or I've come to take potshots at the locals from the Temple's balconies."** He paused for a moment, gauging any reaction the Jedi showed, before continuing: **"So have you been at the Temple long? Frankly, I can't wait to get away from the place!**
Jor had never liked being in more than one place for too long it reminded him of being tied into the soul-destroyingly endless monotony of manual labour back on Dathomir. He had much preferred the life he had with his Master and formerly Tizx, free to do as they pleased (within reason - well as for the Nightsister, there was no reason to it, she just did as she pleased, often strategising for months on end before executing her beautifully crafted plans to ruthless efficiency).

**"I´ve been here for a few days now, and on and off since the war broke out. Been in the field mostly"**
Kieran ignored the others comment about taking shots at civilians as just humor, but he did take note of the rifle hanging on the mans shoulder. It wasn´t a very common sight in the Jedi Temple, and as he took a quick note of the Zabrak´s gear, he didn´t find anything that could identify him as a Jedi at all. Perhaps he wasn´t part of the Order, but some sort of security personnel to be sent along on whatever mission they were about to undertake. Still, Kieran figured, not all who walked in the Temple had had a traditional Jedi upbringing. As he thought of all the pieces of metal in the pack next to him, he figured it was safe to say that he wasn´t the most standard Jedi either.
Curious to learn more about the newcomer, he pointed to the various weapons the man carried.
**"So what are you? GAR? CorSec? Freelancer? No offense, but you don´t exactly look like you belong in this place"**

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-03 23:00:31)

"**I think it's safe to say we've all learned our share of profanities - and had ample opportunities to use them.**"
Jorax's thoughts flash back to the dozens of skirmishes he's been in over the last couple years. He'd been in some rough situations for sure, but somehow he always managed to be a little quicker, a little stronger, a little luckier than his adversaries. Sometimes it just meant landing the last punch in a brawl, other times the results were more fatal. Clearly Marina is happy tinkering, and Jorax decides to let her get her fix before more guests arrive.

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-04 06:03:35)

Jor briefly clenched his teeth at the comment, after all these years it was still a sore point at what had happened to him on test day. It wasn't that he wasn't happy with running missions with the ExploCorp but he always wondered at what could have been.
**"Heh, belong…"** He chuckled his mind mingling momentarily on the word, **"…that's what the council thought at the time too, when I failed the Initiate Trials."** He turned his head in shame, failure wasn't something that he tolerated, especially when he had always trained to be the best at what he did. **"I didn't meet their exacting standards on the day, so now my would-have-been-Master is now my mentor, and I'm tasked with: exploration, which almost always turns out to be violent; and with continued learning, when time suits me aboard one of the praxeum ships."**
It was a life Jor had become accustomed to: never settling anywhere for longer than a month before moving onto another site or scout ship, if he owned a suitcase, he'd have lived his life out of it.
**"So you're obviously a Jedi, at least in dress sense anyway. What fieldwork do you normally get up to? Seen much fighting on the frontline in battle?"**

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-04 06:21:58)

Kieran raised an eyebrow at the other mans revelation. ExploCorp? Somehow he got the feeling that perhaps the army wasn´t beginning to regroup itself into a more substantial form after all. It also made him wonder a bit more about what kind of mission he was being sent on, and he looked eagerly forward to when the shuttle would arrive to pick them up.
**"That´s where I spend most of my time. During the initial skirmishes I was given the charge of base security and reinforcement deploying, but eventually someone figured out to give me command of my own. So for the last months I´ve been holed up on Ninzam, trying to beat the seps back into line. Then I got called back here a few days ago"**

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-04 07:47:41)

**"Ninzam, eh? How are the Draags? Any of them left after the fighting?"** Jor said, recollecting the information on the race from a conversation he had with one of the Cultural experts on a scout ship. **"Do you have a detachment of troops you usually fight alongside? Or is it normally you use what's available at the time."** He continued his questioning, eager to find out more about fighting on the frontline. It was something that was relatively unknown to him as in his division in the ExploCorps, they used subterfuge and smash and grab tactics on missions where they could, however they were more than able to fight their way out of a sticky situation if they ever wound up in one.
**"I wonder if anyone else will be joining us on our assignment? I thought that they would have been sending more of us if we're going to battle, or at least being used as reinforcements."**

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-04 08:31:20)

**"When I left, they were doing fine, and we were about to drive the seps away for good. Wish I could have seen the operation through to the end. For the last year or so I was in command of the 118th Infantry Regiment, and we´ve been fighting mainly in the Mid Rim, with the occasional deployment to reinforce failing positions on the Outer Rim"**
He leaned back a bit and let images and memories of his days in the field flow over him, and he hoped he could get the chance to return to his men soon. They hadn´t let him down so far, and he wanted to be there with them through this thing. But apparently someone had decided this mission was important enough to pull him away from his troops, so he suspected that it would be indeed.
**"What about you? What have you been doing since this thing started? Can´t be much need to explore unknown regions of space when all the ones you´re already familiar with is in flames"**
He chuckled a bit at the last comment, and silently wondered just how much of an overstatement he had just made. With the war expanding as much as it had, it didn´t seem unlikely that at least a majority of the Galaxy was in fact, at war. When he got the question whether he thought they would be joined by anyone else, he just smiled.
**"It´s possible they intend to pick us up here to rendezvous with the troops somewhere else. Though it seems odd to go through that much trouble to bring me here if all they´re going to do is send me out on another assignment. Not to mention your own presence seems to suggest this will be something out of the ordinary"**

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-04 09:47:50)

He chuckled at the comment, his memories flashing back to the number of times they'd been deployed in combat; the days spent waiting out of sight for the glimpse they needed of a target to take him out; and to the number of datacards he'd filled with downloads from various sliced systems.
**"No not at all and I doubt the Republic would take kindly to allowing resources to be diverted for exploration purposes. Well since we've seen more than our fair share of combat within the Corps, our skills have been diverted to other uses. Normally we spend our days tracking down significant separatist individuals or as a forward recon for larger forces, softening up or gathering intellingence on the targets for the main force."**
He paused for a moment before his response to the next comment, again mulling over what they could possibly be doing.
**"Trust me, whenever I'm involved, something out of the ordinary is almost certainly going to happen."** He said playfully, knowing full well that it usually did - his strong bond with the dark side earlier in his life had seen to that. His affinity with it had come in particular use when they were hunting for ancient relics tainted in the darker side of the force, they seemed to call out to him. Of course he was always under the watchful gaze of his Mentor and a handful of other members of the ExploCorps.

**"As long as it involves getting rid of the seps once and for all, I´m on board"**
As he leaned back his head and watched the sky for the shuttle that would arrive to pick them up, Kieran absently unhooked his lightsaber from his belt, and brought the weapon up to look at it. It was a simple design, of the kind that most padawans received as part of their initial training. He had received it from his master personally though, and unlike most other lightsabers given to padawans, the blade was clear as silver. He couldn´t really answer why Sai-Dan had given him such a weapon, and he would never know, but perhaps it had something to do with his hair and eye color. Echani were generally pale in skin, and his hair and eyes were white as snow and silver. Sai-Dan had on multiple occasions told him that he had the "appearance of a saint, but the soul of a warrior", as a comment on how the passive and gentle outlook of his apprentice clashed with that of his active and resolute nature.

**"Here here."** Jor said in concordance, before the Jedi took out his weapon.
Pointing to it he asked: **"Did you construct it yourself? My initiate trial involved me constructing one, I've still got it somewhere, but I think it would be more of a hinderance to me now than my knife and plus they seem to attract a lot of attention."**
He pulled the blade out of his boot, compared to the elegance of a lightsaber it paled in comparison, but more than made up for it in it's practicality when on a mission. Running his finger along the blade, making sure it hadn't dulled, he asked playfuly: **"I wonder where our ride is? It's not like the Republic to keep a Jedi waiting."**

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-04 10:50:37)

Spinning the deactivated weapon around in his hand, Kieran reattached it to his belt.
**"No, it was given to me by my master. It was more important to him I knew how to use it than to build it"**
Staying silent for a moment, he pondered what the other man said about lightsabers. True, they were a pretty unmistakable symbol of the Jedi Order, but that wasn´t exactly a bad thing. He had learned time and again that the mere sight of a deactivated lightsaber usually carried a significant weight in defusing potential fights, and it had helped him and his master on numerous of their diplomatic missions.
**"It is an elegant weapon, but more than that it is a symbol. And as such, it can have more power than a turbolaser. Morale is more important than anything on the battlefield, and having something to rally around can inspire greatness in those who follows it"**
Returning his gaze to the sky, he chuckled as the Zabrak seemed to imply that Jedi were treated with special care, but didn´t answer, figuring their ride would arrive when it was due.

**Jorax**
Marina is content enough to allow Jorax time to himself apparently used to being left to her own devices and the silence hardly unsettling to her. From the cockpit the clone pilot calls back to the pair, "**We're dropping out of hyperspace, we'll be landing in Coruscant shortly**"
Collecting her gear the young Jedi stores it back in the bag. "**Coruscant… It's been awhile since I've set foot there**." With her bag now resting on the chair beside her she looks up at her companion. "**Have you ever been on Coruscant?**" The small jolt from the departure from lightspeed marked their progress. It probably wouldn't be long either till the shuttle landed.
As Jorax responds to her inquiry, the shuttle itself lands and is soon settled on the landing platform, the ramp lowering to allow access to those waiting.
**Jor and Kieran**<div style="text-align: right;">
![Theta.jpg](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20060405185859/starwars/images/7/71/Theta.jpg)
</div>

Almost with that thought, the sound of ship thrusters came from overhead and a Theta-class shuttle landed on the pad, its wings folding up as it set down. Exhaust escaped from the engines as they powered down to idle, but as they didn't power down completely it was assured it wouldn't be there for long. As the ramp lowered, the waiting hauler droids collected the pallets they'd been charged with and began loading it onto the shuttle.

**"Well, when you speak of them…"**
Getting up from his seat, Kieran picked up his pack from the ground and headed towards the lowered ramp of the shuttle. He passed the suddenly very energetic droids without a though, thinking that the speed at which they worked would probably decide how long it took before they would depart. Walking up the ramp, he dropped his pack on the floor and took a look around, greeting anyone he finds inside, and hoping that someone might finally tell him what was going on.

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-04 12:28:54)

Jorax peers outside the shuttle, anxious to see the newcomers. Hearing Marina's remark, and subsequent question, he replies:
"**Above Coruscant - a couple times. On Coruscant - this is the closest. Too crowded and noisy for my taste.**"
As the first robed figure boards the shuttle, Jorax stands and extends his hand in greeting. The fresh air feels good and he breathes deep as his eyes search for the second passenger he had spotted on approach. He smiles cordially and says "**Welcome. I'm going to assume you want to know why you're here, and as soon as your friend boards I'm sure we'll be able to determine none of us actually know.**"

**"Well naturally you should know how to use it, I just thought it was some sort of right of passage that all Jedi had to go through as part of the Order?"** He asked wondering on the tutelage he had been given in preparation for his Trials. He had been given much more of an education after, under Karl's continued mentorship. Jor felt that if he kept up a close enough bond with him, that the Order may one day reverse the decision for him to not continue into the Order and become a Padawan, but this was wishful thinking.
He let out a laugh at the Echani's next remark: **"Ha! You obviously haven't spent much time in the Outer Rim. We've lost several Jedi to bounty hunters and organised gangs, and from this I think they've learnt to not go flashing it around. To such people the lightsaber is the ultimate prize. I've seen collections of them in backrooms, hidden from public view and guarded by the biggest Gammoreans you've ever seen.**

Resheathing his combat knife, he followed Kieran up the ramp onto the shuttle, it did seem like time was of the essence after all. Once aboard he found somewhere to throw his rifle down.

**"Every master may test his padawan how he pleases. I think it was a long time since lightsaber construction was a required trial"**
As he started to head up the ramp, Kieran heard the Zabraks second comment and turned around quite abruptly with a visibly insulted expression on his face.
**"If you think that´s what I mean, then the masters were right to keep you out of the Order. You should keep your mouth shut if you only intend to dishonor the memories of those Jedi"**
Picking up his pace up the ramp, he muttered something impossible to hear. He didn´t want to start whatever mission they were on with an argument, but the stupidity of the comment had seriously annoyed him. As he reached the top of the ramp, he dropped his pack on the floor and raised a hand towards the human that greeted him.
**"All I know is I am to be shuttled to somewhere, to assist a Jedi Master. Though I suspect it´s something other than my usual assignments"**

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-04 13:24:37)

"**Yeah, that sounds about right.**" Jorax responds, now seeing the fourth passenger - a Zabrak it seems - coming up the ramp. Spotting the rifle he carries is a small comfort.
*At least someone else has more than a lightsaber around here…*
"**May as well have a seat then. Guess we'll just have to see how this all unfolds.**"
Jorax sits back down as his mood begins to sink once more. The prospect at some information was enough to lift his spirits, but they would have to remain in the dark a while longer. Patience wasn't something he had in abundance, and he hoped somebody back at the *Solidarity* had some answers.

### **Alicia** (2011-05-04 16:23:50)

The young Jedi greeted the newcomers with a smile. Having not gotten up from the seat she had claimed she waited till they were in sight she finally stood and gave them a slight bow. "**It seems we've all been summoned for a yet to be determined reason, though I have my money on it having to do with the planet Tirrahn.**" As Jor climbs the ramp and comes into view she gives him a pleasant smile, before moving to give him a small embrace. "**Jor! How great to see you again!**" Turning back to the Echani, her own lightsaber swinging at her hip with the shift, she gave him another smile as she held out her hand to him. "**Marina Numa.**"
Around the group as they made exchanged pleasantries, the bulk haulers moved to load the shuttle with it's cargo, but it didn't take long for even that task to finish. With everything aboard the ramp was beginning to close.

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-04 16:35:37)

Glad to see the young woman with the lightsaber dangling from her belt, Kieran extended his hand to respond to her greeting. At least he wouldn´t be the only Jedi on this trip. Still, she didn´t quite look the part of the Jedi, and he smiled as he found his current company a change from his usual surroundings of nothing but people in robes or white armor.
**"Kieran Tanyon, commander of the 118th Infantry Regiment. Currently reassigned to wherever we´re heading though"**
As it seemed she recognized the Zabrak, he took a step aside, allowing them to greet each other. He started to think about what she had said about the planet Tirrahn. He couldn´t quite fix the name, though he was sure he´d heard it before. Still, he´d heard a lot of things about pretty much all the Galaxy in the status reports sent out for commanders to read daily. To be honest, he hadn´t really paid them a lot of attention, instead concerning himself with taking care of whatever his current assignment had been, and then tried to figure out how it fit into the grander scheme of things.
Watching the droids complete their work, he looked at the rest of the people gathered aboard the shuttle.
**"Well, looks like we´re ready to go"**

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-04 16:47:25)

**"Well well, Marina this is a pleasant surprise."** The young Zabrak said as he received the familiar embrace. It had been some time since the two had seen each other. Karl, Jor's master, had allowed him to go on missions with Marina, seeing it as a good opportunity for Jor to expand his knowledge with other cultures in the galaxy and to also acquire the much needed field experience that the missions often presented.
**"How is Master Draay keeping? This isn't one of his missions is it?"** He said as he sat down in one of the seats, making himself comfortable as the droids continued their business, before realising he hadn't even introduced himself to the rest of the group!.
Standing and turning to face everyone once more, he spoke formally finishing with a bow and a cheeky grin: **"Jor Reek, Explore Corps. Reassigned to something hopefully more interesting than being sat in the Temple."**

*Tirahnn…*
Jorax's interest suddenly grows at the sound of that name...
"**Tirahnn? I was near there when the Separatists took it over. Interesting place.**" he says, to no one in particular. "**Sorry, the name's Jorax Okin. I was helping guard Republic freighters in the area at the time. I'm not sure what the Seps wanted with it, but that's not a bad guess.**"

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **Alicia** (2011-05-04 17:07:37)

The young woman gave Kieran a nod and a squeeze of his hand as he introduced himself before releasing it with a kind smile, moving aside to let everyone else get acquainted.
The clone pilot didn't need much prodding to take off cause as soon as the ramp had closed the engines fired up once more and the ship was gradually rising through the atmosphere of Coruscant. Resuming her seat, she strapped in for the voyage before they would enter lightspeed. "**I was actually called away… We were negotiating with a people who call themselves the Opaki. Quite interesting… they attribute their learning in the Force to that of the main elements, fire, water, earth… I won't bore you with the details. Silas found it an interesting example of the Living Force.**" With a wave of her hand she expressed her boredom with the last thought.

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-04 17:31:07)

*I knew it…should probably have paid those status reports better attention…*
Settling down, Kieran heard Jorax talk about Tirrahn, and how it had been taken by the seps. Naturally the Republic would be interested in retaking it, but he was uncertain why it went through the trouble of calling this little group together and not just sending in a battalion to retake it. He wondered what it was about Tirrahn that required this special attention.
Moving his pack to be near his seat, he settled down and strapped in. Changing his mind at the last moment, he instead took a walk towards the cockpit. Sliding in effortlessly, he gave an appreciating nod to the clone pilot.
**"Trooper, has there been any reports coming in from the sieges on Ninzam?"**
He knew it was a longshot that this particular trooper would have heard anything about that particular campaign, but he figured it was worth a shot. He had been unable to get any intel from Ninzam since his return to Coruscant, and he was curious to see if commander Jax and the rest of the 118th had finished the job in his absence. He suspected the commander would have made every effort to wrap things up as neatly as possible, and he couldn´t help but wish he was back there with his friend.

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

Watching Kieran head to the cockpit, Jorax turns his attention to the Zabrak. Someone who carries a weapon that doesn't fit on a belt loop might make a good partner, not that Jorax has ever heard much about Jedi failures either.
"**So… Jor, was it? That's a nice piece of equipment to be carrying around a Jedi Temple. You have a chance to use it much?**"

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-05 06:10:56)

**"On the contrary it's actually quite interesting, the number of different cultures that use the Force never ceases to amaze me. I got word of a particular race that interested me greatly: they can not only change their physical appearance to whatever they what, but they can also shroud themselves from sight….AND from the Force - The Gurlanin, a truly phenomenal race."** He said after Marina dismissed her own comments, his eyes lighting up at the chance to exchange knowledge especially in subjects concerning the Force. **"I suppose Silas' understanding of the Living Force may one day render him able to fully give himself to it, his presence preserved forever, able to pass his teachings onto another."**
He sat back in his seat, massaged by the gentle rumble of the shuttles engines, before the other occupant of the shuttle approached him.
**"Yep, that's the one, I don't think I caught your name though? Unfortunately, it seems the Temple is the only place it attracts any undue attention, anywhere else in the Galaxy it seems to fit right in, not quite as powerful as those Tenloss rifles but she does the trick."** He said with a short laugh, giving this weapon a pat. **"Only ever had the chance to use it out in the field a few times, and by the time the shot's fired, we've normally exfiltrated. What about you? Those pistols look like a fairly mean pair!"**

"**The name's Jorax Okin, and yes - they've come in handy a number of times.**" Jorax replies, tapping the handle of the blaster at his side.
"**They're basic models, I've never had need of anything fancy, but they get the job done. I found it efficient to carry one for folks with a deathwish…**" he turns slightly in his seat to reveal the ion pistol on the opposite hip, "...**and another for fixing…faulty wiring. Sometimes I'm more of a mechanic that way.**" he emphasizes those last words with a hint of sarcasm and grins. "**I found it useful to travel light since I never seem to know where I'll end up. I'd say this little expedition is a prime example of that.**"

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **Alicia** (2011-05-05 13:13:07)

As Kieran takes a seat next to the pilot, the clone gives a nod of greeting. "**Sir,**" he starts. "**I haven't recieved any word.**" The pilot's hands dash over the console expertly, putting in the sequences which would like them into lightspeed once the shuttle was far enough away from the planet proper, and in the clear zone. This didn't take long since the craft was desingated for military use, the zone was much closer. Within a few minutes the Theta-class shuttle made the jump. "**We'll reach the *Solidarity* in three hours, sir,**" the pilot said to the Jedi beside him.
Marina had never been one to care for the intricasies of the cultures, Jor would know. How she managed to catch the eye of a Jedi within the ExploCorps was quite a mystery. Considering, though, the lack of teachers perhaps it wasn't. She didn't respond to her friend's last notion, keeping her peace on that subject. Instead she sat back for the small trip before entering lightspeed. She perks up as the two go on about their weapons. "**Jorax, I'm quite good at tweaking tech. I could have a look and see if I can't up the power a bit.**"

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-05 13:28:41)

"**Hmmm. I'm not sure we have enough hearing protection for you to start another project just yet,**" Jorax replies to Marina with just a trace of a grin, "**but once we figure out what kind of bad guys we might run into I'll let you have a look.**" He gives a quick wink of appreciation and sits back, beginning to relax just a bit.
The prospect of excitement has lightened Jorax's mood considerably and - despite being the only one present that has no real understanding of the Force - he finds himself looking forward to this assignment. He hasn't enjoyed a mission in months, since Pacus was re-stationed.
*Nothing like the common bond of a soldier's ignorance to bring a group together* he muses, wondering what sort of task requires such an eclectic assortment of individuals.

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-05 13:46:23)

Settling down in the seat next to the clone pilot, Kieran returned his greeting and let him continue his work. He hadn´t expected another answer, and he guessed the fate of the 118th would remain a mystery for him a little while longer. As the shuttle made the jump to lightspeed and the pilot announced their ETA to be 3 hours, he got up from his chair.
**"I´ll let the rest of the passengers know. By the way, what forces are stationed on the *Solidarity*?"**
Waiting for an answer, Kieran left the cockpit and returned to the area where his three newfound companions were seated. Taking the seat where he had left his pack, he turned towards the others.
**"ETA 3 hours. That should give as plenty enough time to dig into what the specifics of our assignment might be. Anyone want to take a crack at it?"**

---

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-05 21:19:30)

Jor chuckled at Jorax's joke, before responding. **"Yeah, I try to carry everything that I need on me, and to be honest you can normally 'salvage' other things you need in the field."**
It wasn't long before they were far enough out of the planet's atmosphere to make the jump and once done the echani reappeared from the cockpit.
**"ETA 3 hours?! Bah, I thought this class of shuttles was supposed to be quick."** Jor said with a sigh before guessing at what the mission could potentially be. **"Well, what are the currently established facts? Someone mentioned Tirahnn before; we're almost certainly going to be seeing action against Separatists, that's just how it is; and based on our varied skillsets I'd say it's almost certainly not going to be frontline action with the clones either."**

---

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **Alicia** (2011-05-05 22:23:31)

The clone looks up, taking an at east position at the console. With the shuttle in hyperspace there wasn't going to be much to do aside from maintenance and other busy work. "**Standard compliment for a Venator-class, sir. V-19s, ARC 170s, gunships, more than 2,000 troops.**" The pilot responds, listing off quantities and other types of equipment commonplace of a warship of the *Solidarity*'s caliber. As Kieran leaves the pilot goes back to his usual tasks.
Marina is only slightly disappointed but gives a laugh at his jest. "**No worries… I still have that project to complete.**" With that thought in mind she takes it out the strange translator she had been working on from her bag, her tools spreading across her lap as she gets to work. She gives Kieran a glance and a small smile as he resumes his seat "**Theta's are fast as long as you stay within a system. We must be traveling some great distance.**" She gives a shrug at the ideas being tossed about. "**Sounds reasonable, though frankly it will all be conjecture till we get there.**"

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-05 22:43:07)

**"True it is just conjecture, but it passes the time when we don't have projects to work on."** Jor paused for a second, remembering Marina's technical expertise and seeing how she was willing to have a look at Jorax's pistols, he posed her a question with a smile. **"..speaking of which, Marina my dear friend, you could take a look at my longblaster if you like."**
It was a long shot, but Jor had a sneaking suspicion that the mission they were about to undertake was one too, which could potentially be his last if things turned sour. He remembered back to one of the first missions he went on with Master Incarna where he narrowly avoided being gravely injured after being cornered in a vicious firefight after things didn't go entirely to plan. He was saved by his master's skill with a blade, which moved at inhuman speed to fell its quarry.

"**Well let's stick with Tirahnn for second. I never actually spent much time on the planet itself, but I've heard they have some pretty impressive cities there. There's lots of filthy rich folks who might need rescuing - could be something like that. A small squad is easier for that sort of mission. We know we're headed for *Solidarity*, so we could be serving alongside a main force - maybe as a diversion or sabotage team. I'm not up-to-date on my Who's Who of the Separatist Army but maybe somebody's looking for a capture… or removal… of an enemy commander. I agree with Marina though, it's mostly just conjecture.**"
"**And we're meeting with a Jedi commander after all, you know how mysterious those Force-users can be…**" Jorax jokes, obviously becoming aware of his shipmates' abilities. He continues in a more resigned tone: "**Truthfully - I don't much care. The Seps have racked up a pretty high tab with me, and I look forward to collecting in whatever way possible. If I have it my way it'll involve a lot less negotiating on our part, and more screaming and burning on theirs.**"
With that final comment, Jorax once again rests in his seat and waits to see what the future holds for all of them. If it comes down to it, he knows how to find things out - it just takes time - but he needs more to go on than guesswork.

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-06 00:03:45)

After a good laugh at what Jorax had said, having experienced Jedi diplomacy first hand, he nodded in the Jedi commander's direction, saying: **"I doubt that some of us on board, would take too kindly to our stance on diplomacy."**
Seeing that the discussion wasn't going to progress until they had more information, hopefully once aboard the *Solidarity*, Jor decided to focus his thoughts in meditation. He had hidden it from his Master and the others in the Corps but occasionally his mind was plagued by the image of the holocron's Gatekeeper. It felt more than just an image though, it felt as though he was present in his mind, mocking him for his failures. This was one of those times, beads of sweat started to form on Jor's brow and then he suddenly opened his eyes, panting for breath.
**"P-perhaps it's a simple diplomacy mission after all, the backing of the wealthy on Tihrann could help with the war effort and seriously hamper it if the side with the Seps."** He said mopping his forehead, the image taunting him with the mission doomed to fail now gone.

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-06 03:13:51)

**"I think diplomacy will take a secondary part in this mission. If the CIS invaded by force as you say, then we´re likely looking at a military response. And from what the pilot told me, the *Solidarity* isn´t exactly loaded for diplomacy either. It´s carrying a full regiment, which sounds a little for a diplomatic escort, don´t you think?"**
Leaning back in his chair, the Jedi pondered the other options suggested.
**"Most likely it´s going to be as you said, we´ll be filling in for an absent commando team. With the army stretched as thin as it is, I wouldn´t be surprised if none is available for this insertion. So that means we´re probably looking at sabotage or possibly subversion. Or, which I hope not, a rescue operation for some spoiled noble who´s managed to convince high command that he´s special and important enough that he must be brought out of a war zone at all costs"**

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-06 10:39:36)

Jorax nods to both Jor and Kieran, knowing that having a plan doesn't mean it always goes according to the plan anyway. He settles his gaze on the girl, as if making some final decisions. If it is a rescue operation of some sort he hopes the target has a high enough profile to attract some Separatist cronies, though the chance of this being a boring mission seems to be less and less likely every minute. He's had his fair share of skirmishes, but nothing beyond what he and a couple others couldn't handle. Loss of life was typically low.
*Because droids don't count.* he chuckles quietly to himself.
"**Well that's it then - just have to wait and see. I've never worked directly with the Republic myself, usually I'm auxiliary support or low-level security detachments. I'm sure they're looking for all the help they can get by now though.**" he says, with a tone of finality.

Marina laughs and hold out her hands for Jor to pass her the rifle in question. Leaving the men to discuss what the mission would bring, she stood up taking her bag and the rifle to an empty space of floor. From her pouch she pulls out a visor, which she puts on, the green tint obscuring her blue eyes in a haze. With deft hands, she took the rifle apart looking it over piece by piece. "**You're actuating module is out of alignment. Surprised it has blown up in your face,**" she says looking up at Jor with a devilish grin, before getting work in fixing it.
"**They can't exactly send clones to do covert ops. One look at them in and out of armor and everyone would know they're from the Republic,**" she pipes in. "**They need a team outside of the commandos, but a group who can still do their work.**" The young Jedi doesn't bother looking up as she speaks, continuing her repairs and upgrade of the weapon.

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-09 07:15:30)

Jor lit up with glee when Marina took the weapon from him and was quickly brought back to earth when she revealed that he could have been killed if he'd used it. He listened to what the other's had to say before speaking again himself. **"So, we're a commando group sent in to rescue an HVT or better yet, blow something up. This I can work with."**
He could feel the conversation starting to go round in circles, so unstrapping himself from his seat, he opted for a change of scenary and shuffled into the cockpit. Jor'd been facinated with flying ever since he'd gone offworld for the first time, he'd even learnt to pilot a few smaller craft in his time on board a Praxeum ship. So as not to seem like some kind of overseer, idly looking at the pilot of the craft he makes small talk: **"Do you make many of these shuttle runs? Ever get to fly anything a bit more exciting?"**

*Blowing something up could be fun. Blowing lots of somethings up would be better, but not before we can get into some good firefights first. Explosions are bittersweet that way - so much damage, so little battle…*
Jorax watches Marina working on the rifle, familiar with many of the weapon's parts himself. Studying machines makes one a better droid killer, and while that might be a bit too hefty a title for Jorax it's not far from the truth. They have their purposes and that's fine.
*But if that purpose is to murder without remorse, then we have a problem.*
His thoughts drift to the Force - something he's sure to learn a thing or two about working with this team. It's been said that only living beings can sense it, and the more cybernetics one has the harder it becomes. Droids can't sense it at all, or so he's heard, which means they aren't really living. In this way he doesn't think twice about putting a bolt through a battle droid's processor. It's not murder - it's not really even killing.
*Abrupt deactivation is all.* Jorax pictures the resulting sparks and molten metal with a measure of comfort. *Very abrupt.*

The pilot didn't lie when he told his passengers the trip would last the three hours, and while he isn't a talkative sort he answere's Jor's questions curtly and to the best of his abilitity. Dropping out of hyperspace their destination looms ahead emassed with it's small fleet of support cruisers. The Solidarity appears to be much the same as all of the other Venator-class Star Destroyers, although It has clearly seen its share of battle. Repair crews work allover the outside of the ship, patching holes that were punched in the hull by turbolaser fire. As the shuttle docks with the Solidarity, the spacesuit-wearing repair crews are most prevalent as are the gaping holes that reveal deep gouges into the interior of the ship. This damage was the product of it's latest attempt to rout out the Separatists from Terahnn just a couple weeks prior.
Docking in the expansive bay surrounded by other shuttles and a slim few fighters being repaired and readied, the arrivals are greeting by a pair of clone troopers charged with escorting them to Master Elasra's private briefing room. Upon arriving, three others are discovered already in attendance.
Ezar Elasra is a tall, powerfully-built Barabel with crimson scales covering most of his body. He has donned a functional set of black Jedi robes, and paces before a hologram of a yellow planet hovering above a tactical display. Attending Master Elasra is the captain of the Solidarity, a meticulous looking Human from Corulag who introduces himself as Captain Ralen . Also in the room, peering closely at the tactical display, is a clone commando with his helmet removed. Captain Ralen introduces the commando as Commander Husk, and then dismisses the clones that escorted the heroes to the briefing room.
(Jor's rifle has +1 attack and is not likely to blow up in his face soon.
I jumped ahead quite a bit. Please take some time to add in reactions. I won't move it forward till everyone has caught up.)

Settling down in his seat, Kieran decided against the urge to try and meditate and find the fate of the 118th and instead tried to get some rest during the trip. He knew that field deployment could call for them to jump into the action right away, and he seized the opportunity to replenish his energies. Entering a Force trance, he felt very rejuvenated when they finally arrived aboard the *Solidarity*. Seeing its battle-torn state, he realized that the ship would most likely not carry a large amount of troops into a war zone at the moment, and made a mental note that any form of air defenses should be considered high-priority targets if they were sent in to prepare for an invasion force.
Walking down the ramp of the shuttle with his pack slung on his back, he greets the clone troopers that arrives to escort them to the briefing. As he looks around, he feels a calming sensation of home. Over the last time, this had become familiar surroundings to him, and with the troopers, fighters and military discipline all around him, he felt like he belonged there.
As they arrived in the briefing room, he greeted the present individuals with the titles of "Master", "Captain" and "Commander" respectively. He was a bit surprised to see a non-clone in command of the ship. Even though he knew that the GAR wasn´t entirely made up of clones, it was still an unfamiliar sight. The presence of a commando was also a little bit unexpected, and only reinforced his belief that something special was in the works.
Placing his pack at the wall near the entrance, he brushed away a strand of white hair from his face and waited for the rest of the group to arrive, anxious to learn the final details of their assignment.

Sufficed with the change of scenary, Jor returned to the rest of the gang and took his seat again. Jor watched in wonder as Marina disassembled his weapon, tweaking it here and there, until it was better than new. No sooner had he thanked her for the job she'd done, the shuttle had dropped out of hyperspace and the *Solidarity* and her support fleet could be seen through the viewport.
**"Looks like she's taken a beating, must have been a tough fight against the seps."** Commented Jor as he saw the repair crews scurrying over the craft like insects as the ship came into dock.
With a gentle bump the craft came to a standstill and the loading ramp was lowered. Jor stepped down the ramp into the expansive docking bay. *'Lots of shuttles, not too many fighter escorts? Perhaps they were taken out in a previous battle or they're just in another bay?'* He thought as he soaked it all up before being greeted by the pair of clones, who then led him and the rest of the group .
When they made it to the Briefing room, Jor was immediately taken back by the Barabel. He'd never met one in person before, but they were certainly as fearsome as the stories he'd heard. It looked like a comedy double act when Jor was introduced to the Captain - a savage looking alien juxtaposed against a perfectly groomed human. The room was eerily lit by the glow from the holographic display that the Jedi Master was pacing in front of, and after the introductions had been made, he went over to the display for a closer look, while the others finished getting acquainted.

*Wow. You've been working hard since last I saw you…* thinks Jorax, gazing upon the battered hull of the *Solidarity*. He nods silently at Jor's remark, knowing that damage like that means casualties. *All the more reason to get this show on the road.*
He exits the shuttle with the rest of the team, and proceeds to the briefing room. Along the way he notices some minor changes and patchwork in some of the secondary corridors - probably the result of temporary repairs. Upon entering he greets those present with a small nod and handshake. Captain Ralen and Commander Husk are familiar to Jorax - if only in name. He'd never seen the Jedi though, this Master Elasra. It's possible they just never ran into each other, but Jorax had been in nearly every part of the ship at some point during his time aboard. The display looked like Tirahn, but he couldn't be sure.
Having been in his fair share of briefings, Jorax is content to stand back and give his full attention - the desire to knock some Separatist heads growing by the moment. Folding his arms across his chest, he waits for the Jedi Master to begin.

The Barabel Jedi motions for the newcomers to take a seat in the chairs near the hologram of the yellow planet, the captain and commander moving off to the side, but refusing to sit as the Jedi finishes the introductions. Finally, he presses a button on the emitter causing the hologram to expand in size and from there a serious of Separatist ships come into view.
"**The planet you see before you is Tirahnn, a world on the Perlemian Trade Route. Some months ago, the planet fell into Separatist hands, and we could not spare the resources to oppose them. Since that time, the Separatists have used their control of the world to disrupt trade and supply lines, and the Jedi Council has tasked us with dislodging the Separatists and reopening the trade route.** 
"**This display shows the Separatist defense fleet around Tirahnn. As you can see, the planet is extremely well defended, and a direct attack against such fleet would be costly.**” Selecting another key on the panel the display changes to a map, a red dot blinks pinpointed a specific location within an expansive city.
"**Tirahnn's capital city possesses a planetary ion cannon that was used unsuccessfully in its defense when the Confederacy took control of the planet. We believe that a small strike force can slip post the blockade, seize control of the planetary ion cannon, and use the cannon to launch a surprise attack against the fleet in orbit. With a large amount of the defense fleet disabled by the ion cannon, our fleet will jump into the system, engage the remaining defenders, and launch a full-scale ground assault to liberate the planet.**
“**Two squads of troopers and commandos have been assigned to this task with you as backup, one team, however, will be sent in a separate pod. We’ve also identified a Zygerrian commander, Zolghast, as the man in charge of the ion cannon’s security. He may prove a useful lead in overcoming the cannon’s defenses, though should you encounter him your orders are to capture and hold him for interrogation.**”

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-13 16:11:29)

*So the troopers will hold off a planet of alerted Confederate forces while we fire at their ship one at a time. Sounds like fun. I may need to look into those upgrades Marina offered after all…*
Jorax listens intently, all manner of eagerness now gone from his countenance. The goal is steadily coming into focus now, and the urge to wreak havoc on the Separatist army steels his thoughts. He studies the display carefully and begins to recognize some familiar landmarks. He's never been *on* the planet - he wasn't lying when he told Marina that - but he's been in orbit around Tirahnn enough times to have a rough idea of it's layout. The cannon is almost certainly a fortified position and this Zolghast character might not be willing to listen to Jedi council.
*Just as well,* thinks Jorax, recalling another capital city he was much more familiar with that found itself in a similar situation. *Only this isn't Theeds, and I've got nothing on this planet to lose.*
It still beats just about anything he could've asked for. Battle is all but guaranteed and working this closely with the Republic is a bonus. Hesitant to interrupt, he continues to listen to any further instructions and the reactions of his squadmates.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-17 16:00:17)

Kieran listened during the briefing, and there wasn´t many surprises for him. Though he had to say it sounded a bit optimistic that they would be able to take out a large portion of the CIS fleet, and he suspected that the main benefit of them seizing the cannon was that it wouldn´t be used against them. The most reasonable course would seem to be to fire as much as possible with the cannon before they were overwhelmed by the ground garrison, and then break the weapon and slip away. But still, none of the questions he had brought aboard from the shuttle had been answered.
**"It all sounds well and good, master, but I sense there´s more to it than that. This sounds like an assignment that two commando squads should have no trouble completing on their own. And if it isn´t, I fail to see how a bunch of troopers, a couple of soldiers, and a Jedi would make a difference. As such I can only assume that there is something to this mission that isn´t suitable work for clones"**
He already had some ideas about what those things might be, but he figured to await the masters answer. Perhaps he was wrong, and the Council really thought that a small addition to the commando squads would be able to make the mission a success.

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-24 03:35:05)

*'So, we finally know what we're doing here: a take and hold mission, with a hint of potential interrogation.'* Thought Jor as he mulled over the various options for attack and their associated risks.
**"Do we have any intel on what resistance we're going to face when our pod drops and whether there is likely to be a counter attack when we have control of the cannon? I guess in the worst case scenario we'll have to hold out until the fleet knocks out the droid control ships."** He said looking at the tactical display of the planet, covered in swarms of red dots. Jor listened to Kieran's comments and nodded along in agreement *'Either this mission is of high importance to send Jedi on it, or there is something that we're not being told.'*

---

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-24 08:28:14)

Kieran turned his head as the Zabrak spoke.
**"We should definitely assume that there will be a counterattack, and that we have a limited time with the cannon. If we could identify the control ship that commands the forces closest to the cannon, a well-placed shot in it would buy us some more time before we withdraw. But assuming that they will let us have it in peace would be foolish"**

---

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-24 10:18:30)

**"This is of course we assume that what we'll be facing is droids with a Zygerrian commander instead of a Tactical droid as head of security, I have a feeling it's not going to be just droids, which may play in our favour, since they wouldn't be connected. If we take a more cloak and dagg– saber approach and only take out high priority targets then we may be able to fire off a few ion cannon shots before they alarms trigger and someone puts two and two together.** He pauses, pacing back and forth for a few seconds in front of the tacmap.
**"But then again we'll probably face heavier resistance when they do find out, since we wouldn't have cleared the path ourselves, but we'll at least be able to get off at least one well placed shot."**

### **Alicia** (2011-05-26 17:28:56)

“**This operation requires a bit more finesse than a team of commandos would be able to handle. They are easily recognizable, and as it may be required to infiltrate the facility housing the ion cannon the easier it is to blend in the more likely hood of success. Commander Zolghast is also extremely paranoid and if he were to discover a clone the operation would fail,**” the Barabel Jedi says in regards to Kieran's question. “**It's believed Zolghast is the only one with the firing codes necessary to fire the cannon. If he can't be located then making the cannon inoperable will suffice.**” Master Elasra turns to Captain Ralen giving him the go ahead to answer the other questions.
Stepping forward the human captain of the Solidarity clears his throat slightly before proceeding. “**The Separatists have a wide array of droids and vehicles occupying the planet as well as a small battalion of mercenaries being transferred on and off the planet, but for the most part you should only have to deal with battle droids in capturing the ion cannon.**”

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-27 06:23:48)

**"So…infiltrate the ion cannon complex, interrogate Zolghast, get the codes, fire the cannon. Save the day. Plan B, Zolghast accidently gets a blaster bolt in his face and we blow up the complex. Sounds fairly straightforward."** Jor said emphasing the "accidently" with a smile, before thinking back to what the Jedi Master has said.
**"These mercenary transports… is there any way we could get on board one? Our infiltration would go much more smoothly if we were disguised as the enemy in their own camp…."** Jor posed the question as it didn't seem that their mission was particularly time critical if it was to just ease the planet's recapture.

---

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-27 16:51:43)

Jorax, hearing all that's being said, decides to add his thoughts:
"**I agree with Jor. It looks like it could get tricky dealing with a planet full of Seps - anything we can do to get closer to the facility gets my vote. We might even be able to convince a few to help out. In my experience for every good mercenary there's a hundred mediocre ones. They're either looking for action - which,**" Jorax smiles slightly and sweeps his gaze across the room, but continues, "**I think we can pretty much guarantee, or money - which I imagine we can provide…?**" His eyes come to rest on those of Jedi Master Elasra he finishes the question.
*Of course this is all semantics,* he thinks to himself. *Nothing ever goes according to plan, but someone with inside knowledge might help significantly in the event that the Zygerrian proves difficult. And spending some Republic coin should be called for if the planet is really so important.*

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-29 17:18:49)

Kieran smiled and leaned back in his chair when he got the answer from the Jedi Master.
**"And I suppose this paranoia of his would extend to Jedi as well? Guess I´ll try to be discreet"**
Listening to the suggestions of his newfound allies, he rubbed his cheek a bit. He didn´t want to start out as being the one was was negative, but the way he saw it there was a major hole in their plan.
**"No offense, but I think you are overlooking the fact that we are supposed to bring a dozen or so clones with us. Call me crazy, but I think the other mercs might suspect something if we brought them on board. So at least some of us have to find alternative ways to get planetside. Though from what I heard, that has already been taken care off"**

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **Alicia** (2011-05-29 17:32:17)

"**The clones sole purpose is to provide backup on your mission, how you use them will be up to you. Once in the city you may even be able to discover a way to discreetly get the team into the city itself to assist you.**" The Jedi Masters says turning to Jor. "**We had considered sending in a team through their recruitment efforts but finding an appropriate entry point and taking the chance you would be sent to Tirahnn would take too long; time those waiting for critical supplies do not have.**"

---

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **jaybee3** (2011-05-30 08:51:13)

*'Whenever someone starts a sentence with "No offense"…what a mynock.'* Thought Jor as he listened to the Master's reply, before responding to Kieran.
Jor rolled his eyes as he turned to the Echani, his boiling under the surface at the Jedi's arrogaunce. **"Well obviously, I wasn't going to have the clones come with us, they would have proved a useful diversionary force, bringing us to the action with the other mercs. But alas it's not to be, due to the time constraints. Speaking of which, if all the planning is done, shouldn't we be going? I think this young Jedi Commander has some clones to lead."**

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-30 13:13:40)

*This is a good start.*
With Kieran and Jor trying to hash out who gets how many clones, Jorax decides ask the Jedi Master a couple questions of his own.
"**Master Elasra - you mentioned a separate team landing in a pod. How big a team can fit in it and how far away from the city are you planning to have it land? Maybe it would be easier to envision this if we had some sort of map of the facility or the layout of the area…?**"
*Working security is easy: You don't shoot the good guys. Anyone who does shoot the good guys is a bad guy. You can shoot bad guys. Tirahnn is a whole planet full of bad guys, with some good guys probably being held somewhere. The Republic is about to send in some good guys. The rest is just improvisation.*
"***Looks like we get to be the Jedi super-weapon this time.***" he whispers to Marina, winking.

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-30 13:25:01)

Kieran didn´t much bother or mind Jor´s tone. He wasn´t sure if the last remark was meant to imply that Kieran´s youth would indicate inexperience, or if it was a declaration that the Zabrak was going to go his own way no matter what. He suspected it was a bit of both. What was more interesting was what he had meant as a plan. For if he had meant what it sounded like, then the Zabrak had just lost a few more points in Kieran´s book.
**"Wait a moment…let me get this straight. Your plan was to send the clones in advance to stir up a Mynock´s nest that would allow us to slip in alongside the mercenaries that will be dropped in to combat them. And then what? Help them beat down the clones to strengthen our standing with them, or try to overwhelm them from behind, just us?"**
Shaking his head, the Echani got up from his chair.
**"Good thing we weren´t able to go through with it if that was the case. If it wasn´t then I apologize. But my suggestion is that we go in in two teams, with the non-clones and a commando unit setting down closer to the settlements to begin infiltration, and the rest of the clones drop further away to set up a temporary field command"**

---

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **jaybee3** (2011-06-01 04:25:23)

Jor simply raised his hand and spoke softly. **"Enough. The details of my plan matter no more, and I definitely don't need to justify myself to the likes of you."**
*'….stuck in this meeting while being lectured to by another Jedi upstart, great. The sooner I can put some distance between him and his infinite boxes of toy soldiers, the better.'* He thought absently as he began to pace around the room once more.

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-06-01 06:17:37)

**"No you don´t. I just wanted to make sure I had understood you correctly. We wouldn´t want any misses in communications jeopardize our mission, now would we?"**
Kieran turned to the Jedi master to see if there was anything more. Jorax had asked a few questions, and it couldn´t hurt to see what answers Master Elasra provided. He didn´t say anything, but he did ponder the last sentence Jor had spoke. It was true that there was no chain of command established here, but if the Zabrak was really suggesting that they considered throwing away the lives of their clone allies in vain just to make the ride simpler, then he *would* have to answer to Kieran.

“**There will be a contingent of six troopers and four commandos in each pod. While you are proceeding with your missions the troopers will stay to guard the LAAT/s until you need them. The commandos will be proceeding to infiltrate and sabotage the primary Separatist military base located near the outskirts of the city.**” Motioning toward the map he zooms into a topographical representation of the city. “**The drop ship will land several klicks from the city, the rest of the distance you will need to proceed on foot. The ion cannon control center itself is located deep in the city. We can provide you a few topographical maps taken recently from orbit.**”
Till now he’s been ignoring the disagreement between the young Jedi and his new ally. “**I trust these differences will be resolved quickly. I highly advise you do not split up until you reach the city. While the wilderness itself is mild, you will need your combined resources when you make it to the city Tirahnn. If there are no further questions, report to the shuttle bay. The LAAT/s is waiting.**”

*So as long as we make landing undetected, we should be alright.*
"**Excellent, thank you.**" replies Jorax, grateful for the map data. "**Approaching on foot may give the appearance of somehow being connected with those mercenaries anyway. It sounds like a good time to me, I'm game.**"
Jorax steps back from the display with a resigned look, content to follow his team mates to the shuttle bay.

As he began moving to pick up his pack, Kieran shot the Barabel a smile.
**"Don´t worry, Master. We´re professionals. And may the Force be with you until we meet again"**
Hoisting his pack on his shoulder, he gave a quick bow towards the Jedi Master and the Captain. Turning towards the commando, he offered a quick nod before he headed for the shuttle bay.

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **jaybee3** (2011-06-06 08:52:38)

*'Oh they'll be resolved, alright.'* Thought Jor as he mused on the Jedi's words, before audibly answering him: **"Yes, yes, of course, like he said 'We're Professionals.'"**
Jor continued to think on exactly what sort of a professional Kieran actually was as he headed towards the shuttlebay. *'Professional….Professional…wizard…no no, far too basic. Professionally thermal! Well he's definately that…look at him, he'd fit right at home on Hoth, camoflauged until he got his shiny stick out and beat something with it.'*
Remembering he'd forgotten his rifle, which he'd set down next to the door, so that he wouldn't forget it, he rushed back to the meeting room to get it, saying to the others: **"I'll see you at the ship."**

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **BWS2K** (2011-06-06 11:14:14)

Following Kieran, Jor and Marina as they file out the hatch, Jorax ponders the mission ahead.
*Finally, a chance to hit the Seps hard. This is the real test, everything until now has just been practice.*
His thoughts go back to his homeworld of Naboo - its once beautiful landscape now tainted with the fallout of battle. Burnt out shells of war machines lay as hulking monuments to inflated victories and disastrous defeats, strewn about the cratered hillsides and charred forests like the playthings of some cruel giant. Some beauty remained, but would the planet ever recover? Would anyone? Alliances forged in the shed blood of lost warriors are not easily broken, but it's hard to imagine who could ever stand up to the wave of automatons sweeping over the galaxy at present.
It's not exactly a phrase he would expect to hear from his Jedi companions, but Jorax is reminded of an ancient saying: "Revenge is a dish best served cold." Adjusting his hip holsters as he strides alongside his companions, he muses:
*I don't know about temperature, but mine comes in two flavors: regular and ion.*
"**So, gentlemen - and lady,**" he smiles at Marina, his mind returning to the task at hand, "**Anyone have any further thoughts loosely resembling a plan, or are we just operating under a "shoot everything without a pulse" policy?**"

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-06-06 11:20:37)

Not turning his head around as they walked, Kieran smiled to himself as he answered Jorax´s question.
**"Well, since this is an infiltration mission, how about *don´t shoot unless they try to shoot you first*? We don´t want to attract unnecessary attention, and I think we´ll have plenty of opportunities for battle once we seize that cannon. I´d suggest we make into the city, and make a quick survey of the place before we proceed further"**

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **Alicia** (2011-06-06 14:51:30)

The master responds back in kind to Kieran and then to the others and watches as the group leaves the room.
Marina falls into step beside Jorax, quietly contemplating the mission at hand. “**Kieran’s right. Without more intel on what’s happening in the city we’ll have to gauge the situation when we get there. Until then we should try to be as inconspicuous as possible.**”
Backtracking the way they had come it doesn’t take to reach the shuttle where the LAAT/s is waiting, the clones doing a final check of their gear outside of the two awaiting transports. Spotting them approach, they snap to attention and then proceed to board the ship. Ten clones board their respective transport, the four commandos and six regular troopers taking up barely a third of the allocated space for troops. A pair of clone pilots make a joke with each other before each going their separate ways to the transports, one of them stopping just short of a ramp. “**Sirs, I’ll have the honor of transporting you down.**”

### **jaybee3** (2011-06-10 04:47:37)

Snatching up his rifle from the briefing room and slinging it over his shoulder once more, Jor headed back towards the shuttlebay, it wasn't long before he had caught back up with the group and fell back into step with them. After being greeted by the pilot,
Jor replied with a laugh: **"Let's just hope their isn't too much turbulence on the way down. I don't think the Seps will take too kindly to us trampling on their blueblossoms and everlilies in their back yard."**

## Re: GAR - Chapter One: Expropriate

### **BWS2K** (2011-06-10 10:51:21)

Chuckling at Kieran's reply, Jorax turns to the Echani: "**Right, isn't that what I said?**"
"**And as far as our landing,**" he continues, proceeding up the shuttle ramp, "**I don't imagine the Separatists care much for gardening.**"
Never having worked directly under Republic forces before, the clone troopers already aboard are a comforting sight for Jorax. The reality of battle sinks in - an oddly familiar feeling, and his thoughts drift for a moment to what the next few days might bring.
*Now here are my kind of people. Soldiers. Warriors. Each one with a role and each one willing and able to fill it. Subtlety is definitely the key to this mission, at least at the onset, but when push comes to shove it's nice to know we've got a couple squads of these guys watching our back.*
"**And besides,**" Jorax says, now addressing Jor, "**Turbulence or not, let's remember one thing: it's *our* backyard, not theirs.**"
A grim smile on his face, he adds, "**So let's ask them to go home.**"

### **Alicia** (2011-06-12 12:57:44)

Marina follows on board the LAAT/s transport, giving the clone pilot a nod in greeting. The troopers and commandos have already begun to settle in, strapping themselves in on their respective sides (the troopers sitting together on the opposite side from the commandos), their rifles balanced across their laps. The troopers' armor is almost shiney white, but the commandos' armor is blaster scored and painted to show a certain individualism. All of them are quiet, though thanks to the internal commlinks its quite possible they're holding some private conversation within the confines of their helmets.
Stashing her bag in the netting above the heads of the commandos she takes a seat next to them and begins strapping herself in. Following being Kieran, the last to come in, the pilot closes the ramp before making his way to the cockpit and finishes the last of his pre-flight checks. It's not long till the thrum of the engines is the dominating noise in the transport.

Jor let out a chuckle at Jorax's joke before replying as he began to strap himself into his seat: **"Perhaps after they've gone, we could invite them 'round to visit and they could sample our delicious Wookie-ookies and nuna bacon?"**. He had unstrapped his rifle from his back and it was now clenched in between his legs as he reached for the braces and buckled himself in. It was eerily quiet aboard, until the engines kicked in - Jor brutally aware of the row of Clones busily communicating to each other through their comlinks. Deciding it best to probably be on same frequency, he leant forward and asked one of them: **"What channel are you guys on?"**

One of the troopers looks up, apparently the squad leader. "**A secure private frequency, sir. I'd be happy to share a secured alternate frequency, but we've been ordered to keep comms silence on it unless necessary.**"
Next to Jor, Marina gives a laugh, "**Don't worry about it, trooper. We wouldn't want to ruin your squads fun.**" Settled in next to her, Kieran has finished strapping in. The rumbling of the engines can be felt through the deck plating and then finally the ship seems to be moving. It's not long after that before the ship enters lightspeed. From the cockpit the pilot calls back it will be a few hours before the LAAT/s will drop out of hyperspace just inside of Tirahnn's star system.
Marina settles in, deciding to take a nap in the uncomfortable seats, and there she remains unless interrupted.

Jorax takes his seat and buckles up for the flight. He sits in silence for a few minutes, quietly collecting his thoughts before they reach Tirahnn.
*I wonder how many droids we'll actually have fight, and what sort of terrain it'll be on? Hopefully we can avoid detection until we reach the city - much easier to have a firefight in an urban sprawl. And this Zolghast character - what sort of soldier is he? Zygerrians don't have the best reputation to begin with. Perhaps he'll be willing to see reason, but I think we'd settle for coercion at gunpoint.*
As the ship lurches into hyperspace, Jorax adjusts his straps a bit and turns to the trooper on his left. The impending battle has him feeling a sense of both stoic focus and shared camaraderie.
"**So, you guys have any intel on what sorts of numbers we can expect in the main city?**" he asks, and then adds with a grin, "**And don't worry, we'll save some for you.**"

Acknowledging the clone pilot with a nod, Kieran boards the transport and straps in. Next to him, Marina settles down, and pretty soon her intentions of napping during the trip became clear, and he figured that it might do him some good as well. The Force would make sure that he was fresh when they arrived on target.
Speaking out to no one in particular, he adjusted his position to try and make the seat at least somewhat comfortable to rest in.
**"I´d appreciate it is someone could let me know a few minutes before we exit hyperspace. I kind of hope we won´t be going in hot, but if we are I´d like a chance to dress up"**
Not waiting for a response, he let his consciousness slip away into the Force, and slowly drifted away.

"**At any given time least a standard garrison, but they will have support available in orbit,**" the clone commander responds to Jorax's question, the speakers of his armor buzzing slightly in the confined space. "**They've been using the planet as a staging ground due to it's accessibility to the trading route.**"
With the promise of a long flight, the others settle in for the ride. Within a matter of hours, the ship emerges from hyperspace well away from the planet of Tirahnn. From the cockpit, the pilot calls out to his waiting passengers, "**We're going dark from here.**" His words are just enough warning as most of the nonessential systems power down and the ship begins the long, nearly silent trip from the edges of the system toward Tirahnn itself.
Several long hours pass and finally the planet Tirahnn fills the forward viewport. The clone pilot calls back once more, '**We're entering full silent mode, turn off all electronics now!**" Having woken up from her sleep, Marina proceeds to make sure all her small electronic devices are off, not wanting to be the one to tip off the Separatists.

Jorax, too, makes sure his comlink is off and he's prepared. His face set in a grim countenance, he checks his both his blasters too.
*Can't afford to have these jamming up today, not with the use they're likely to see.*
He remains silent for the last leg of the flight, his mind running through various contingencies and reactions. Never before has he faced such odds, but then he's never worked with such professionals either. His hands instinctively go to the small stone worn around his neck as Jorax considers the possibility of battling a full garrison of the Separatist droids. He wonders how this new team will fare today - will they be able to work together as a cohesive unit and emerge victorious or will they fall apart into petty squabbling and end up another set of numbers on the Republic casualties list?

Waking from his sleep as they approach the planet of their destination, Kieran slips out of his chair and picks up his pack. Taking a few steps back into the ship, he starts to unfold his armor and strap it on. Tucking his robes behind the plates, he puts them all in place, though leaving some of the robes out to partially conceal them. Finally, he places the massive blade across his back and straps it diagonally, securing it firmly in place. As he secures the bandolier across his chest and back on an opposite diagonal, he checks that the electronics of his armor is shut off. He isn´t overly concerned though, as the stygian alloy in his armor covers up a lot of electronic traces, and should have no trouble at all hiding him from long sistance scanners.
Hooking his lightsaber at the lower end of his bandolier, close to his left hand, he returns to his seat, now fully armored for battle.

The transport glides silently through space, operating as a black speck to anyone that happens to be observing from any of the Separatist ships. There are long, tense moments that pass as the dropship passes through the Confederacy blockade, but no turbolaser fire flashes after you. The ship begins to rattle as it plunges into the atmosphere, seeming to be nothing more than a meteorite burning up on entry.
Marina looks up at Kieran as he takes his seat, fully armored and armed. The look she gives him is one of amusement as she looks his new attire over head to tow. "**I hope they don't know what an armored Jedi looks like,**" she quips, but her thought is interrupted as the ship's rattling proceeds to get worse.
Once clear of the blockade, the clone pilot begins firing up the dropship’s systems to bring it in for a covert landing on the night side of the planet. However, before the pilot has a chance to set a suitable approach vector, the entire ship bucks as it is tossed around by errand wind currents. There is the sound of tearing metal, and alarm klaxons begin to sound through the interior of the ship.
“**Strap in!**” calls the pilot. “**This is going to hurt.**”

At the pilot's warning, Jorax reaches up to tighten his straps.
*This is not a good start…*
As the klaxon blasts its deadly tune a panel bursts open next to Jorax. Sparks pour out and the smell of burnt metal and wires begins to fill the cabin. The small fire dies out in a moment and he can see the damaged parts clearly, and damaged is an understatement. Unfastening his belts, he leans over and attempts some repairs.
"**No worries, I've got this,**" he shouts above the alarms, "**looks like the ion flux distributor is fried. I can re-route it through the phase inhibitor field, but that's pretty much a one-off.**" Jorax retrieves his tool kit and gets to work. "**Of course, plummeting towards impending doom in enemy territory is generally a once-in-a-lifetime event too…**"

Alarms now blaring and the ship's hull screeching, Jor unbuckles and rushes into the cockpit, deftly avoiding a flying panel dislodged by the chaos. As he enters the cockpit he sees the pilot wrestling with the controls, and jumps into the seat next to him. Jor has to shout above the alarms as he buckles himself in: **"Looks like you could use a hand!"**
He scanned the instrumental panel in front of him, he'd flown an LAAT/s in simulations but never in the flesh but the controls felt fairly similar at least.
*'…looks like we're in bad shape…'* He thought, seeing a good eighty percent of the warning lights flashing, those being the only things he could really focus on - outside it was a blur, the scenery below and the clouds all blurred into a brown mess as the ship span out of control towards it.
With one hand he flicked switches above him on the overhead panel, to the inexperienced eye this was just a morass of useless baffling buttons and dials but to Jor's he knew that they could mean the difference between a 40foot blood stain on Tirrahn's surface and another successful mission. With his other he gripped the co-pilot's stick tightly and felt the sheer force of the winds battling with the craft as they tried to get it under control.

Smiling back at Marina, Kieran retakes his seat.
**"If anything, they´ll attribute the design to the Sun Guard, and they have been longtime allies of the CIS, so it shouldn´t be a problem, as long as I don´t flash the lightsaber to openly"**
As the hip started to rock, he looked around in the ship. He wasn´t too worried about a crash, the ship was built to hold up to a lot. What he was more concerned with was to make sure everyone was ready in the case they did go down hard. He was pretty sure the clones had some idea, but he figured they might need some encouragement and direction in what to.
**"Troopers, listen up. If we go down hard, it won´t take long them to get someone out to inspect, so we better be prepared. If we go down, I want you up and about asap, forming a perimeter around the ship and find and way to get out in case we need to leave in a hurry"**

Marina eyes Jorax’s work for a brief moment before her eyes close in concentration. The sound of tearing metal subsides significantly as she holds the ship together as best she can. Sweat begins to form on her brow from the effort. Left to his work, Jorax manages to restore some of the maneuvering repulsors burned out during the atmospheric entry.
In the copilot’s seat, Jor’s assistance allows the ship to level its descent slight, the angle reducing the chance of a fatal crash as the ship is now not careening straight for the ground.
The clone troopers and commandos can only sit and hope their straps are tight enough as the ship continues to plunge. They do however nod at Kieran’s words, using them to take their minds off the imminent crash.
The ship plunges toward the ground at a steep angle, and the pilot yells a battle cry as he pulls back on the yoke. The ship lurches upon impact with the ground, and threatens to rattle itself apart as it digs a deep furrow in the ground. After what seems like hours, but is really less than a minute, the drop ship comes to a halt. Anyone not strapped in receives a nasty blow, but is otherwise unharmed.
Long moments of silence follow until one of the commandos calls out to the cabin, “**Everyone 100 percent?**” Within moments, the remaining clone troopers and clone commandos all signal they are fine, and bright moonlight streams into the ship’s passenger hold as one of the side doors is force open.

Bracing himself in his seat for the impact, Kieran feels the straps pulling at him as the ship crashes into the ground. As the armor plates cuts into him, he thinks that maybe he should have waited until after the landing to gear up. But then again, without the armor, the straps would have tugged harder at his body, so he guesses it evens out in the end. Besides, the point was that he wanted to be ready if they were to have the misfortune of going down right next to a CIS patrol.
Responding with a call that he was ok, he unstraps himself and makes his way over to help the troopers force the door open. Looking out into the moonlit landscape, he tries to look for any immediate threats or other points of interest, reaching out with the Force to find what the naked eye cannot.

When the ship finally comes to rest Jorax stands and rubs his forehead. Other than a sizeable bruise from not being strapped in, he seems to be just fine.
"**A hundred percent…give or take!**" he shouts in response to the call. Jorax looks to his team mates and sees they seem to be alright, having exercised the wisdom of staying strapped in. As the moonlight spills in, he checks that his blasters are still secure and adjusts his bandolier and utility belt - both having been twisted askew when he landed on the deck moments earlier. He watches Kieran approach the open door and wonders just where they've managed to land.
"**We were planning a little walk anyway, weren't we?**" he mutters under his breath, waiting for some confirmation of where they are.

Coughing to clear his lungs and brushing the dust off himself Jor calls to the others: **"I've been better, but nothing a stiff drink won't cure."**
Clambering out of the cockpit and over the rest of the wreckage, Jor makes his way outside to meet the rest of the detachment. **"Looks like we'll need another ride off this planet."** He adds surveying the wreck of their transport, before the switching his focus to the surrounding landscape in an attempt to gauge how far off their intended drop zone and if there were any noticeable obstacles in between. He also wondered if the crash had attracted any undue attention from the separatists or the local fauna and listened to see if he could hear anything approaching them.

Recovering from the crash landing, the troopers begin to vacate the transport with the rest of their fellow passengers. The troopers and commandos, after taking an initial look around move to the cargo hold to unload the damaged ship.
The area of the crash site is a rocky section of flat land. However, the crash of the LAAT/s has not only dug a furrow in the ground behind the ship, but also has flung up large chunks of earth that have been scattered around like boulders.
With a thunderous roar and a rumbling of footsteps, a massive, horned creature emerges from behind the boulders tossed from the ground by the crash. The creature is nearly three times the size of a Human and has massive claws and a long, powerful tail. The creature walks with a loping gait and seems to be hunting for something small to eat.
Standing nearly 5 meters tall and weighing as much as a rancor, this lumbering beast looks to be a predator that is used to getting what it wants. However, this particular creature looks somewhat malnourished, and there is sluggishness in its movement that suggests weakness.
Having moved to help the clones, Marina doesn’t see the creature as it lumbers around the mass of boulders. Jorax is also initially unaware of the creature as he extricates himself from the bowls of the LAAT/s.

All of the squares within or crossed by the furrow of earth leading out from behind the crashed ship count as difficult terrain. The large boulders on the map vary in size from 1.5- 3 meters tall; all of them can be used to provide total cover for a Med-size creature standing adjacent.
The ship may be entered via the cargo hold as a move action, though exiting onto the ground costs one additional square of movement.

At the sound of the massive roar and thunderous footsteps, Kieran´s mind immediately snaps towards the place where the massive beast emerged. Dropping into a semi-crouched stance, his hand reaches back for his lightsaber dangling from the low end of his bandolier as he watches the creature.
*Come on then if you want to play…let´s play*
The Echani jedi lets his hand dangle close to his lightsaber, but doesn´t grab the weapon just yet. He need to get into a better position in order to fight it on his terms. Reaching out for the Force, his senses sharpens, and new energy flows into his body as he awaits the beasts move.

While still out of the Jedi's range of his lightsaber the twitch of the creature's tail indicates it may not have to be to do some serious harm. The creatures move only seems to provide Jor with a better shot as it comes out from behind the boulders, but in the open space who knows what sort of advantages the creature will have.

Even as he was shouting, the Echani Jedi started forward, unhooking and igniting his lightsaber as he picked up speed. The silver blade flared to life as he came closer to the giant beast. Diving into a roll to evade a sweeping tail, he came up in a spinning motion right beneath the creature, slashing his saber with both hands against one of its legs. Even as he saw his lightsaber clear the creatures flesh he held the weapon out wide and bolted for a nearby cluster of boulders, bounding his step of a nearby rock and somersaulting through the air to avoid the retaliation of the no doubt angered beast.

Charging forward, the Echani's silver weapon flashes as it hits its mark leaving a bloodless gash in the creature's thick hide. Roaring in rage, the creature's long tail comes around and slams down on the Jedi (30 damage) the blow shaking not only the Jedi but the ground as it hits.
Coming around, Jorax fires off his pistol in rapid succession, the shots barely missing the creatures face, but blinds it momentarily as it bends down to take a bite out of Kieran. From behind the Commandos and troopers work their way through the ditch as they unholster their weapons, getting into position to open fire and finish the beast.
Taking aim on the beast, Jor fires two shots in rapid succession but misses the creature entirely hitting the adjacent rock. Chips fly out as the bolts leaves a severe scorch mark on the rock.
Literally leaping into action, Marina surges forward calling on her innate ability in the Force to speed her way. Leaping over the ditch she runs forward in an attempt to flank the creature and sends a rib crushing blow toward the creature and connecting, the creature's hide seeming to give way beneath the blow. The creature howls in pain its attention diverting to the young woman.

Feeling his armor plates press up against his rib cage, the Jedi is glad he put it on as the creatures tail connects solidly in his chest, sending him staggering and nearly knocking him over. Gathering his senses together, he calls upon the Force to find the weak spot in one of his opponents legs as he moves forward. As he moves in on the beast again, he drives the energy blade into the back of its lower legs with force, and as he spins around he strikes the hilt with his armored elbow just to twist the blade even further before gripping it an pulling it free of his opponent.

Jorax is already lining up another shot as he watches both his first rounds soar just past their mark. Seeing both Kiernan and Marina landing some attacks of their own, he hopes they aren't drawn into an extended firefight. Whereas the crashing ship may be dismissed as galactic debris, blaster fire could draw the unwanted attention. He sees the young Jedi technician earn the Roggwart's ire with a skillful body check and lets off another pair of bolts aimed at the wounded creature.

Cursing that he couldn't even hit a target that size as his comrades rush into melee, the Echani taking an almighty wallop from the creature, Jor jogs along the tear in the ground to get a better line to his target and in a gradual attempt to try and flank him. Deciding that he'd gone far enough and ought to be firing at the monstrosity once more, he lines up his rifle with the target and fires off another couple of shots in rapid succession. This time hoping that they'd somehow find their way to the target.

Attempting to ignore the wounds inflicted on him, Kieran calls on the Force to aid him, but as he reaches out the pain of his wounds distracts him and his own strike comes slower and less precise than his full potential. With their companions in melee range of the creature, Jor, Jorax and the clones are slightly hesitant, taking their time to line up their shots. Aiming well, only the commandos' autofire attack seems to do any damage to the rancor sized beast while the clone's shots put more scorch marks in the surrounding rock and rivets in the ground. As the creature is continually attacked, blaster bolts and a gleaming lightsaber blade cross in front of its vision, the wounded creature grows increasingly enraged. It's tail slams down again, aiming for the spot where Marina had been standing, but the light footed woman dodges out of the way only to have to dodge out of the reach of its jaws. Off balance her own attack misses.

Frustrated with his less-than-desirable accuracy, and what it could mean for his team, Jorax moves into a better position and lines up a single shot.
*This is getting tiresome, and aside from the injuries it's almost certainly going to draw attention now…*
The young soldier's vision becomes clearer, and time seems to slow for Jorax only a moment as the round leaves the barrel of his weapon.

Still dazed from having the wind knocked out of him, Kieran finds his attack less effective than he had hoped, and his grasp of the Force slipping. Noticing somewhere in his peripheral vision that the clones have gotten into place, he yanks his lightsaber free of the creatures leg, and with a Force-assisted backflip throws himself out of range from the beast, landing beside a nearby boulder.
Picking up his pace, he sprints around the boulder, bringing his silver-bladed weapon high above his head as he bears it down on whatever part of the beast is closer at the moment, trying to coordinate his attack with Marina on the other side, wanting to catch it slightly off guard.
((
Move: Tumble away from the creature, and move around the small boulder to the square opposite Marina

Standard: Melee Two-handed lightsaber attack

Frustration and anger bubbling beneath the surface at not being able to hit this surprisingly agile beast, Jor flicked the switch on his rifle, turning the autofire on.
*'If two bullets can't hit this kriffing thing, then perhaps ten will!'*
He said to himself as he pulled the trigger, the rifle shaking in his hands as it expelled its luminescent load.
