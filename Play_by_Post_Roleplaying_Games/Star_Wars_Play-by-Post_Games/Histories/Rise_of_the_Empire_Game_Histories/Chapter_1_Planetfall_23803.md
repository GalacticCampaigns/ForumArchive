# Chapter 1: Planetfall

### **Tempeste** (2009-02-28 06:38:37)

â€œThis is Alpha Command, youâ€™re cleared for take-offâ€ states a monotone voice over a comm-link to the pilot, he replies with a professional tone and moments later the Laat/i Gunship begins to plummet towards the planetâ€™s surface. After a few seconds of flight the small holoprojector in the centre of the compartment lights up. It shows the blue tinted visage of your trainer, Boran fess. He has a stern expression that seems somewhat accentuated by his scarred brow.
â€œThis is it squad, the real thing. Command has identified a long range artillery emplacement far to the north of the main battlezone.â€ Boranâ€™s image was replaced with a satellite image of the target area. It depicted a large bunker with 3 large cannons protruding from the roof. â€œThis area should be lightly defended. Nothing more than a few natives and a small detachment of battle droids. But itâ€™s going to be a long day soldiers, after youâ€™ve completed your primary objective youâ€™ll likely be retasked and transported to a new objective. Any questions?â€
---------------------------------
The Gunship is carrying two squad of commandos, for a total of 8. This includes all of Aiwha squad (Mec, Mir'sheb, Thrax and Ser) and also Lokan Squad (Blitz, Purge, Shadow and Sky).

While checking equipment "Last one to kill a clanker has to kiss a geonosian" said Blitz to break the tension. "Oh and Sky if you shoot me in the ass again I will beat you down whith the wet end of a geonsians leg. You'll be cleaning your armour for weeks befor that stuff comes off".

---

### **Avarna** (2009-02-28 09:15:12)

Mec ran a brush along the barrel of his Enforcer pistols, as he listened to the briefing. Looking around at the other commandos, Unlike the others he had a satchel loaded with demolition charges. "Sounds like fun."

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-02-28 09:50:38)

"Keep it down Blitz," orders Shadow whilst checking the last of his energy cells, "Once we're on the ground I want you completely focused on the mission." He then turns to face the hologram, "If it's lightly guarded then why do we need two squads.. Wouldn't one be enough Sarge?"
The hologram flickers for a moment, "We expect light resistence but we can't be sure. This is an important target, if those guns aren't taken out then the main assault will take severe casualties... Can I count on you RC-1080?"
"Yes, sir," replies Shadow, "What about Extraction?"
"Once the primary objective is complete a Laat/i Gunship will be tasked with picking you up."
Shadow nods and runs a quick check over his sidearm.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-28 10:01:45)

Ignoring the banter of the other commandos, Thrax finished loading the launcher on his rifle with Ion charges. Clearing the weapon for function, he checked the charge of the power pack, making sure it would last him through the day. Stepping into the wiew of the hologram, he offers a relaxed salute to his instructor.
"Everything checking out sir. Do you want those guns destroyed or merely claimed for use?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-28 10:35:18)

Blitz stops checking his equipment and looks up at shadow "Sorry boss just eager to kill some clankers. I've been stuck in med-bay for a week with 3rd degree lazer burns on my back side (scouls at sky). It's a long time for a soldier to go without killing anything, or been able to sit down anyway I dont plan on getting shot on this god forsacen bug nest. (Puts helmet on) Sir"

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-02-28 12:19:58)

"We'll need them put out of action Thrax, if they're left intact then they'll get remanned after you've left the area. You can either destroy the guns with explosives, or find some way to permenantly disable their targeting computers, either way suits us. Be careful if you decide to use explosives though, those guns are likely surrounded with spare ammunition." The hologram flickers once more, "You're getting close now, remember move fast and quiet. Remember your roles, leader, scout, sniper.. Demo. Make sure you're in the right place at the right time. Oh and Blitz, I hope none of you plan on getting shot."

---

### **Mandalore89** (2009-02-28 12:27:02)

Upon hearing that the gunship was close, Mir'sheb looks up from recalibrating the systems of his buy'ce and pats the blaster cannon sitting at his side. "Great, I've been looking forward to trying out this baby on something besides training simualtions"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-28 12:30:58)

"Roger that sir. WeÂ´ll take them out"
Picking up his rifle and turning back towards his team, he smiled.
"You heard then man Aiwha, letÂ´s wrap this up and move on"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-28 13:10:29)

Blitz shouts " WOOW COME YOU CLANKERS LETS SEE HOW YOU MATCH UP TO A REAL CLONE TROOPER! Oh and Sky your up front this time."

---

### **Avarna** (2009-02-28 13:13:02)

Mec pulls on his helmet and double check the helmet package, then stands up drawing one of his pistols, and wrapping a hand around one off the handholds dangling from the roof. "Ready when you are, Thrax."

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-02-28 13:25:43)

Shadow slings his rifle over his shoulder and stands near the right side of the compartment, carefully hooking himself into the drop rope. "Blitz, you've the best eyes in the unit so you'll take lead. Sky you just your sights striaght, and pointed away from Blitz. Purge.. You'll keep our rear clear, we don't want anyone trying to flank us from behind."
The doors now open for the first time, revealing the barren landscape of Geonosis. The gunship banks and expertly weaves through the air, avoiding the large spires. The pilot opens the intercom, "We're two clicks out. Make your final checks and get ready to descend."

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-28 13:39:32)

Following suit next to Shadow, Thrax hooks himself into the rope.
"Okay Aiwha, we descend in pairs. Me and Mec goes first to secure the area. We expect cover from the rest of you while we drop. Once we drop ground, scatter into cover, eyes in all directions. Then we move from there. Any questions?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-28 14:16:20)

"Kay boss I'll go up front but I'm telling you if I get shot in the back one more time who ever fired that gun is gonna get all my available ammo in the crotch" says Blitz

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-02-28 16:47:26)

The pilot now brought the craft to a hover. Boran spoke once more, "Shadow, you go down first, Aiwha squad second"
Shadow nods and moves closer to the edge of the compartment, "Mount up Sky, Purge goes after you. Blitz, you descend on this rope once I'm on the ground."
Sky and Shadow now leant over the side of the gunship. The Gunship bobbed to the side a bit as they began to descend to the surface. Purge spoke for the first time since they embarked the gunship, "Incoming Fiire!!" As he finished shouting a fist sized shell ripped through the gunships hull, and a second punctured a fuel tank. The Pilot began to struggle with the Bird's controls, "This is Alpha Spear! We've taken damage... We're going down! I repeat.. Alpha Spear is going down!" The craft began to fall into a spiral as more shells ripped through the air. Shadow and Sky desperately try to hold on but in vain, a High explosive shell rips through the right of the transport compartment, destroying the Jumprope hooks and sending the two commandos to their death.
"SARGE!... Sarge!" Screamed Purge, now reaching downwards with his right hand, trying in vain to somehow scoop them up, behind his helmet his face contorts with anger. His emotion is quickly drained though as the Gunship is thrown to the side, knocking him out of the compartment to collide with the ground 30 feet below.

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-28 17:07:57)

After been flung out of the gunship, leg caught in the ruins of his squads jump ropes Blitz shouts "HA IS THAT ALL YOU GOT YOU STUPID CLANKERS, YOU NEVER MET MY TRAINER!" Blitz pulls out his pistol while hanging up side down from the crippled gunship and start shooting wildly into the abyss. Sudenly the sky is lit up with multiple explosions as the lazer bolts hit home on the the incoming shells. "HA PISTO BEATS SHELL, WAIT TILL I GET MY RIFLE I'LL SHOW YOU SOME REAL TARGET PRACTIS!" Sudenly the gunship backs sharply lettin a loss power cable out of the ship and into arms reach of the strugaling clone. Blitz grabs it and pulls himself up into the batter deck of the gunship and stears right at the others on the other side of the deck "Guess I'm with you guys then."

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-02-28 17:17:45)

The gunship is now losing height fast, the pilot struggles to keep the nose up but the craft hits the ground hard. Eveyrone aboard is thrown about, possibly out of the craft and onto the ground surrounding it. The hologram has now dissapeared and the hull has buckled in many places. All of Aiwha squad made it alive, though shook up, Lokan squad has been virtually destroyed, Blitz the only survivor. The front of the gunship begins to sprout flames,it's unclear whether or not the pilot is dead.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-28 17:24:53)

Blitz start to scavange through the wreckage of the once powerfull gunship, looking for any thing that could be of use, his one regret that he didnt have the equipment to try and save the pilot. Blitz runs to the front of the cockpit trying to see if the pilot could still be alive.
(Perception +11)

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-28 17:31:52)

Regaining his composure quickly from the crash, Thrax unhooks himself from the line and checks his rifle for damage. Taking a quick look over his squad - now including the apparent only survivor of Lokan squad - he waves them forward with his hand.
"Move it squad. Find cover and dig in for the moment. Do not open fire unless fired upon"
Before barging his way out among the debris in the ship, he shoots another glance at the new guy, checking in on the pilot.
"Blitz, is it? Leave him, he has done his duty so that we can do ours. And since youÂ´re with us now, start acting like a commando, or weÂ´ll be a four-man squad again pretty soon"
Thrax makes his way to the opening in the ships side, searches for anything to take cover behind - rocks, trees, some wreckage part - and then sprints outside, scanning the area as he ran.
((Perception +10))

"Eey sir" in a dull tone. Checking over his rifle "Blast a scratch that will take weeks to fix"

---

### **Mandalore89** (2009-02-28 17:37:21)

Mir'sheb looks upon the flaming LAAT/i and realizes that numerous training simulations could not prepare someone for something like this. As his adrenaline kicks in, he remembers his training. Taking heed of his leader's command, he then scans his surroundings looking for possible enemy contacts and sprints to the nearest available cover.
(Perception +11)

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-02-28 17:40:52)

Thrax fails no notice anything out of the ordinary. Blitz however manages to hear a faint murmur from within the wreckage. It seems to be coming from the Cockpit. Inside the Pilot seems to be coming round though the small fire is begining to engulf the cockpit. The area itself has rocks and a few large boulders littered around. You seem to have come down within the Valley, possibly not far from the intended drop zone. Mir'sheb also fails to notice any Hostiles, he does notice the smoke that now seems to be filling the cockpit however.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-28 17:45:34)

"He's ok, I dont care if it not protocol sir but I've just watched 3 of my Friends... No. Brothers fall to their death and I'm not going to stand by and watch someone else die unneceseraly" Seeing the danger of shooting into the cockpit, Blitz looks around to see if there is anything he could use, other than his weppons to smash the glass.
(perception 11+)

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-02-28 17:54:55)

Blitz doesn't manage to find anything that looks particularly useful, apart from a few large rocks that look as though they may be able to shatter the cockpit glass.

---

### **Avarna** (2009-02-28 18:27:27)

"Rifle busted?" Mec asks as he walks over to Blitz, and takes a look at the weapon. (Mechanics +8) Assumign there is nothing mechanically wrong with the weapon, he lifts his head up long enough to spit on the scratch and wipe it away. "There all better."

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-02-28 18:35:53)

The weapon seems to be fine apart from a few small scratches near the handle. As Mec looks up from the weapon he notices the cockpit behind Blitz, the pilot is now banging on the glass in a feeble attempt to escape the flames.

---

### **Mandalore89** (2009-02-28 18:39:55)

Mir'sheb rushes over to the cockpit and attempts to smash in the cockpit's transparisteel with the butt of his cannon. "We'll get you outta there ner vod. Just hold on!"

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-02-28 18:44:44)

The Transparisteel yeilds under Mir'shebs assault and begins to crack, eventually smashing completely. Smoke now begins to exit through the hole.

---

### **Valheru** (2009-02-28 18:50:26)

Ser picks himself up off the deck of the larty and shakes his head to clear out the cobwebs. Thankfully he had his helmet on, otherwise the crash probably would have killed him. Once he's finished checking his equipment, which has become almost instinctual, the events of the last few seconds suddenly come back to Ser. Looking at Blitz he feels an almost overwhelming since of...pity. He's never felt pity before, but he's pretty sure that's what this is. Going from a full squad to losing every single one of your brothers in a matter of moments has got to be...agonizing.
Thax's orders coming in snap Ser out of his daze and remind him he's standing aboard a flaming gunship in the middle of enemy territory. However, he stops short of moving and glances towards the pilot, "We can't just leave him Sarge...can we? I mean he may be just another fly boy but he's also a brother."
Seeing Mer'sheb leap to action Ser follows suit. Ser quickly reaches through the smashed transparisteel, attempting to find the pilot and haul him out.

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-02-28 18:59:27)

A combined effort of Ser, Blitz and Mir'sheb, results in the Pilot being pulled form the wreckage, although with some difficulty. He falls to his knees as they lift him out and quickly removes his helmet, instantly taking a few deep breaths..
"Ah.. I was nearly cooked alive.. Thank you." The Pilot now notices a sever pain in his left shoulder. It seems he had dislocated it.. Maybe worse. It was a remarkably light injury though for what he had just been through. He winced a little at the pain, "Any of you trained in first aid?" he asks.
(Could you post your profile in the character thread Valheru?)

---

### **Avarna** (2009-02-28 19:32:55)

Handing the rifle back to Blitz, Mec walked over to the wounded Pilot. "I can fix damn near anything." The clone commando replied, holstering his slugthrowers, as he looked over the pilot. "Toughen up!" Mec replies, as he gets to work
(Threat Injury +8)

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-02-28 19:39:38)

Mec makes the quick diagnosis of a dislocated shoulder and attempts to get the bone back into the right position. He fails on his first attempt and the Pilot grunts a little with pain. The second attempt succeeds however, and Mec manages to fashion a sling from cloth within his medpac. The pilot's left arm is out of commision for now though he can still use a pistol, something he quickly realises.
"Hey erm, Thrax? Do you want me to stay here.. Or come along with you? I.. I'd only slow you down. If you can just leave me a Pistol... I'll stay if you want."

---

### **Valheru** (2009-02-28 19:55:58)

Realizing how exposed they are Ser snaps, "Whatever Sarge decides we can't stand out here in the open next to a downed larty lit up like a signal beacon! Get some cover *vode*, shift it!". Putting action to words Ser sprints for cover before readying his rifle and looking for hostiles.

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-01 06:06:48)

Everyone now makes it into cover, including the pilot. As you survey the area you notice a large squad of B1 Battle droids advancing on your position from further down the valley. There seems to be at least ten of them and they haven't spotted any of you yet. They're about 150 metres away (100 squares) and seem to be advacning with some caution.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-01 08:29:38)

Glad that his commandos finally got in place, and - despite hat anyone might think - happy that they had managed to save the pilot, Thrax turns his attention to the enemy. Opening the line on his helmets internal comm, where he could speak plainly without risking detection by the tin cans, he started to give out orders.
"Mec, Blitz, stay close to our pilot. No one gets left behind while IÂ´m on command. MirÂ´sheb, Ser, target the center of the squad and wait for my signal. WeÂ´ll finish this quickly and move on. We have a job to do"
Moving his forward grip on the rifle to enclose around the trigger to the grenade attachment, waiting for the droids to get in range before firing.

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-01 08:52:42)

The droids advance until they're a hundred metres away before one notices Ser's helmet sticking out above a large boulder. The droid raises its blaster to fire only to be disabled by a well aimed shot from Thrax's grenade Launcher. The 3 droids stood next to it all fall to the ground in a heap of sparks.

Slapping the switch on his rifle to engage its autofire mode, Thrax issued a new command over the comlink.
"Okay squad, forward! Mec, Blitz, supportive fire. MirÂ´sheb, Ser, overwhelm them"
Throwing a quick glance around for a forward covered position, he got to his feet, sprinting out while pressing his trigger and sending a hail of ionized energy into the remaining droids.
((Swift action to change fire modes, Move action to move towards a covered position closer to the droids, and Standard action to make an area attack centered to hit as many droids as possible. +2 to hit, 3d10+2 Energy damage))

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-01 09:39:11)

Thrax expertly unleashes a hail of fire, puncturing the armoured shells of 3 more droids and decapitating another. As it's chassis hits the floor however, 3 small objects appear in the distance. You realise that they must be the deadly Droideka destroyer droids, and they're heading straight for you. They'll soon be in range and ready to fire.

Spotting the droidekas Ser announces, "Rollers approaching!" over the squad frequency. Ser calmly looks down the scope of his rifle and lines up a shot on one of the approaching droidekas and fires as soon as the time is right.

### **Mandalore89** (2009-03-01 15:25:52)

Seeing that using his cannon against only 2 clankers would only be a waste, Mir'sheb instead targets the approaching rollers and waits for a good shot.

Blitz's shot hits home and knocks one of the B1's onto it's back, permanently disabled.
The 2 destroyer droids keep rolling towards the commandos. Ser manages to hit one whilst it's still in it's wheel form, negating any chance it's shields had of stopping the blast. it isn't enough to destroy it though. The droids continue rolling forward, Mir'sheb now aims his Blaster Cannon and fires. The powerful bolt of energy explodes just in front of the droids, destroying the one damaged by Ser and dealing significant damage to the others. The droids now uncurl about sixty metres away. Their shields flicker into life and they begin filling the air with eadly lasers. The first droid misses completely but the second hits home and damages Ser for 8 points of damage after knocking down his shields.

As MirÂ´sheb reduces one of the approaching droidekas to slag, Thrax dives down behind his cover and moves a few switches on his rifle as the destroyer droids uncurl and their deadly lasers fills the air. At the first opening in their flood of fire, he pulls his head up and fires a focused salvo at one of the destroyers, hoping his damage will be enough to break through their shields.

Temporally forgetting about his squads fate, Blitz says sarcastically down the comm " Rolling clankers how original, nothing special about you is there sky....." then realising with a sigh "Oh..I'd..." then with a roar "Dam you blasted clankers, this ones for shadow, this ones for Purge, this ones for sky and this one is for my ass!" Raising his rifle, wanting to make every shot count Blitz fire rapidly into the Destroyer Droid.

The shots penetrate the droids already weakened shield and deals significant damage to the Droideka's chassis. The Destroyer droid whines as sparks fly from it's inner components.

---

### **Valheru** (2009-03-02 13:44:14)

Ser grunts in pain as a shot glances off his shoulder. Thankfully the blast was *mostly* absorbed by his armor. Ser ignores the minor injury for now, like any commando would, and focuses on the task at hand, destroying those dangerous droidekas. Still keeping close to the rocks for cover he aims for the droid already damaged by Thrax and Blitz.

Mir'sheb's cannon spits a large energy bolt towards the remaining droid, only for it to impact on the shield, dealing minimal damage to the droid itself. Mec charges foward but his shots miss badly and hit the floor around the droid, Prompting it to turn it's attention to him and fire. It unloads it's two blaster cannons towards Mec, filling the air with hot energy bolts. Luckily the shots are easily stopped by his shields.

Mir'sheb notices Ser's terrible shot and says "Come on Ser. You gotta do better than that unless you wanna end up a kyr'ad!" and as a reply to Blitz's earlier remark Mir'sheb shouts back "Ha! You only punched through that roller's shield cause I weakened it for ya!" Mir'sheb then lines up his cannon on the remaining droideka and fires another shot.
(2 swift actions to aim, ranged attack with blaster cannon +8 (4d12+2) w/ Deadeye and devastating attack)

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-05 10:59:53)

The powerful shot goes straight through the droideka's shields and the machine explodes in a flash of white fire. Mec's rounds impact on the now motionless husk, adding some insult to the droid's destruction. As the droid collapses Thrax's long range comlink recieves a transmission, it's Boran. "Alpha Command to Aiwha Lead. I repeat, Alpha Command to Aiwha lead. What's going on down there? I've lost readings for most of Lokan squad and the Gunship as well.."

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-05 11:14:24)

Taking a quick check around for any more approaching droids, Thrax lowered his rifle and picked up the comm.
"ThatÂ´s because theyÂ´re no longer there, sir. We were ambushed, and most of Lokan squad is gone, including our ship. WeÂ´we picked up their survivor and the pilot, as well as dispatched a squad of B1s and some destroyers, over"

"Ha Ser your about as useful as a Ewok with a with a bunch of logs with that rifle" laughed Blitz thinking how much damage Ewok could do with a few logs, not much he thought.

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-05 14:17:18)

"Ok, We can't extract them from here. Take them with you and complete your mission, I'll advise when needed. You should head north from your current location, head down the canyon and try to find a way through to the Bunker. Be on your guard, they'll know you're here now. The main forces have just begun battle with our own but it seems this area is more heavily defended than we anticipated." Boran stopped for a moment and a light static filled the comlink, "RC-0117 is now under your command, treat him like any other member of your squad, I suggest you make sure the pilot is armed, he doesn't have your training but he can help. Alpha Lead out.."

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-05 16:10:06)

"Hey pilot I never thought to ask but what's your designation, name and what's it like to be surrounded in a burning cock pit with all the people you were friends with dead right next to you? Or is this an inappropriate time?"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-05 16:25:58)

"Affirmative sir"
Turning back to his commando squad and the two newcomers, Thrax picks up his rifle into ready position again.
"Alright squad, listen up. We will not receiving an extraction from here, but it doesnÂ´t matter, since we have a job to do. We move north, towards our target, and we move fast and hidden. The army has made contact, and resistance is greater than expected, so our task just got more important"
He looks over the commandos again.
"Ser, you take point and stay ahead of us. 0117, I donÂ´t know what your speciality is, but if you think you can keep yourself from being spotted too quick, you can join Ser. Mec, you and MirÂ´sheb watches our backs. If there are no questions, letÂ´s move"
He hesitates for a moment, and then adds a comment.
"And from now on, we act like commandos, is that clear?"
He hands his sidearm over to the pilot.
"I know you are not trained for commando duty, but I know you can handle one of these. Stick close to me, and weÂ´ll all get out alive"

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-05 17:01:34)

The pilot checks the pistol over and nods as Thrax finishes speaking, "Mine's stuck in there somewhere," he says, motioning towards the burning gunship with his eyes, "Thanks."
The canyon ahead seems clear of Cis forces for the moment, it's only a matter of time before more arrive though.

---

### **Avarna** (2009-03-05 17:09:57)

"Roger that, Sir." Mec replied, holstering his pistols. Then he walked over and picked up a pair of blaster carbines off the downed battle droids. He offered one to the pilot, hanging onto the other himself. Then he takes takes a rear guard position.

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-05 17:18:43)

The pilot takes the carbine but slings it over his shoulder, "They never trained us with rifles, we spent that time in the flight sim." He turns to Blitz now, "They always called me Hawke, it was originally Hawkeye until I... We should get moving?"

---

### **Mandalore89** (2009-03-05 17:26:43)

"Affirmative, sir." Mir'sheb replied and slung his cannon over his back. Seeing Mec equip himself with a clanker's blaster, Mir'sheb does so as well, believing that it might be better to save his cannon for when they actually reach the bunker. "Alright Mec, lets make sure our vod don't get shot in the shebs."

---

### **Valheru** (2009-03-05 18:35:05)

Ser bites back a curse, he hates missing. Trying to keep in mind that Blitz has just lost all his brothers the sniper lets his comments go with little more than a grumble, something about HUDs and calibration.
As Thrax relays their orders Ser nods, "*Elek russ'alor!*". Heading north, darting from cover to cover, he calls out to Blitz, "Come on *vod*!". Clicking off his comlink Ser mutters to himself, "It's a good thing these suits are sound proof."

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-06 11:28:19)

To Thrax over the comm-net "I used to be up front, best eyes in the squad, (whit a sigh) poor fellow, any way I was never one to dwell on things so lets get moving shall we" clapping his hands together and checking his ammo "I don't plan on getting shot on this dust ball so lets get this over and done with"

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-08 19:08:56)

Hawke walks over to the downed gunship and kneels to pick up his helmet that he threw to the ground earlier. He had hoped to wear it but the visor was coevered in scorch marks and he would've been blinded if he put it on. He throws it back onto the ground and looks up into the sky for a moment. Hundreds of miles away the people he trained with are fighting, dying and killing. War... He was glad that they were all trained for this, lest civilians have to fight for themselves. He then realises where he is.. Now isn't the time to think why they're fighting, but simply to do it.
He looks over towards the Commandoes before walking to stand near Thrax.
Ahead of you the canyon continues for a few hundred metres, it then turns to the left. It's walls are steep and a good fifty metres high in the shortest parts, it's impossible to climb without the proper equipment. Your Hud's display a somewhat basic map of the area. It's clear that you need to continue down the valley.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-12 17:57:21)

"Well squad, letÂ´s pick up the pace and get moving"
As all orders have been distributed, Thrax sets his squad on the move.

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-12 19:57:22)

As you move down the canyon and turn the corner, you notice a metallic structure embedded in the wall a hundred or so metres away. It looks like soom sort of exhaust vent. Apart from that there isn't anything of interest.

---

### **Valheru** (2009-03-13 02:02:27)

Being on point Ser is one of the first to notice the vent. "Thrax, I've got what looks like a vent here, could be a possible access point to the target. On my way to check it out now," he coms. Ser approaches the vent carefully, on the lookout for any threats.
((Stealth +10, Perception +9, if I make it to vent without seeing any enemies I'll search it to see if it's safe to enter.))

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-13 08:14:07)

The area is clear, the only movement is of small pebbles whiped through the air by the increasing winds. The vent it certainly big enough to fit a man through though you can't make out what's on the other side without removing the Metallic grate that covers the hole.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-13 08:29:19)

"Roger that Ser, hold right there and weÂ´ll catch up"

---

### **Valheru** (2009-03-13 13:00:55)

"I copy, standing by," Ser replies. The commando finds some cover to hunker down by and waits for his brothers to catch up, all the while keeping a sharp look out for any hostiles.
((Perception +9, Acute Senses))

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-15 11:24:50)

It takes a few moments for the rest of the squad to catch up, during which you spot no enemy activity. You do notice however a faint clikcing sound coming from the other side of the vent, you can't make out exactly what it is, but it doesn't sound mechanical.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-15 12:38:51)

"Hey guys that's no clanker, but it could be a bug, a big bug." said Blitz cautiously.
Stepping away from the vent and aiming his rifle at the vent.
(swift and move action to aim the rifle down the ventilation shaft)

---

### **Valheru** (2009-03-15 21:55:32)

Ser frowns at the unidentifiable sound, then shrugs. "Well there's only one way to find out. Cover me while I see if I can get this grate off."
((Mechanics +9 to see if I can remove the grate without shooting it or blowing it up :P))

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-15 23:03:14)

"Alright, Ser, Blitz, get in there and investigate. The rest of us sit tight"
Moving in behind some nearby cover, Thrax keeps his eyes in the direction from which they came, suspecting that the crashed ship and missing droid patrol might draw more unwanted attention.

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-16 09:14:48)

The hatch cover comes away easily after a few moments of tugging at it. The clicking noise quickly fades away and you see what looks like a rocky passage on the other side of the vent. It's near pitch black, your Hud adjusts and you see that the passage leads into a large cavern.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-16 14:07:19)

Sarcastically Blitz says "Ah great, bugs in the dark. If I get Slime on my visor I gonna blow this whole place to Kamino."
Raising his guard.

---

### **Mandalore89** (2009-03-21 13:18:05)

Mir'sheb checks the power pack of the clanker carbine he recently acquired and takes a look at the dark passage. "These Seps better have something better up their sleeve if they wanna stop us."

---

### **Valheru** (2009-03-22 13:56:34)

Ser advances into the cavern as stealthily as he can, keeping his rifle at the ready and his senses alert.
((Stealth +10, Perception +9 /w Acute Senses))

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-03-22 15:01:11)

As you descend into the passage you don't notice anything strange or hostile. The tunnel is certainly large enough to stand in though you'd have to walk single file for the first ten metres or so, after which it widens out before opening out into the large cavern.
----------------
Above ground the whining sound of a repulsorlift engine becomes apparent, and moments later a large dropship comes into view. It's heading right for you and judging by it's size, it must carry at least a platoon's worth of Battledroid's. It announces it's presence by firing it's forward repeating blaster's in your direction. At this range the shots clatter harmlessly around you, you may not be as lucky once it gets closer however.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-25 19:22:34)

"Alright squad, pick up the pace, but keep it quiet"
Hoping that the ship hasnÂ´t spotted the squad and is just firing randomly into the area, Thrax lowers his rifle and keeps it trained towards the dropship. He knows they canÂ´t fight of the entire load on that ship, but with a little luck he hopes to keep them cautious enough that his squad can slip away.
"Mec, you get in last and rig some charges to drop the tunnel entrance behind us. It might be narrow for them to enter, but I want to be able to close behind us if we have to"
((IÂ´ll keep aiming for the ship, and if I get an opportunity to hit a large group of droids right away - like when they start to unload - I will fire a grenade. That should keep them a little cautious when dropping off))

---

### **Valheru** (2009-04-15 17:37:08)

"Seems to be all clear inside," Ser reports to his squad mates. He continues to cautiously advance into the cavern.
((Stealth +10, Perception +9 /w Acute Senses))
