<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">STAR WARS: DAWN OF DEFIANCE</span>
**EPISODE I
THE TRAITOR'S GAMBIT**
It is a dark time in the galaxy. The evil Galactic Empire has spread from the Deep Core to the Outer Rim, and everywhere the Empire's tyranny can be felt.
Fleeing from the oppression of the Emperor's minions, agents of Senator Bail Organa have run to a remote space station above Brentaal. Known to be a vocal opponent of the Empire, Organa may be the last hope of freedom in the galaxy.
In the hopes of stopping these dissidents before they can reach the Senator, the Empire has alerted its forces on Sel Zonn Station, where the struggles for liberty rages on, and the first sparks of rebellion have begun to burn.

The transports hold is filled with row after row of seats. Small and confined, with room for possessions only found under those seats. A dozen races sit in the hold creating a unique smell blended of exotic foods and tired desperation. After a long ride at light speed, the passengers can feel their destination nearby as they slow to sub-light speeds. The only ones seemingly unaware are scattered about the passenger area. The Duros staring at the flight cabin with mixture of a vacant smile and sour frown. The tall Human soldier bedecked in military garb, clearly another of the countless wayward soldiers spewed out after the Clone Wars, too busy checking his gear to notice the approach probably. Two occupants couldn't notice a Bantha loosed in the hold. One had his robe down over his entire face only a wisp of brown hair escaping, while another had his duster coat drawn tight and his hat pulled low. A common habit for species that were so odd looking as to draw unwanted attention from the other races. Everyone else was already scrambling for their luggage.
The transport Captain chimed in announcing final approach.
Seemingly motionless among a sea of starships and satellites above the twinkling world of Brentaal. Sel Zonn Station grows larger in your view every second. A central pylon forms the bulk of the station's mass, and three landing platforms leading to docking bays extend from the central section, equidistant from one another and jutting out into space. The dorsal side of the station features a disc-shaped secondary structure, on top of which blinking lights indicate the presence of a landing platform reserved for wealthy patrons.

As the door opens the passengers funnel out into the Promenade. The Promenade is filled with the bustle of revelry and commerce. Spilling out of the gambling halls are the sounds of victory and the moans of defeat, while the music of local bands issues from the cantinas. Only a handful of citizens mill about in the main area of the Promenade, a few gazing out the massive windows at the planet Brentaal hovering below. Businesspeople hawk their wares to the passerby, and a few Imperial stormtroopers make their way down the main avenue of the Promenade on their usual patrol at a leisurely pace.

The Duros steps out onto the Promenade, and stretches. He had been cramped up in the small seats for far too long. "Not a fan of the pilot's docking ability. Not nearly smooth enough," Elor critiques to himself. He had quite the habit of judging other pilot's abilities (or lack thereof). Anyone looking at him would notice his constant adjusting of the fingerless gloves on his hands, which seemed to be a nervous tic. Elor stops at the large windows and takes in the view of Brental, amongst the buzz of activity in the Promenade.

Reka steps into the Promenade and looks around, his eyes instantly drawn towards the Imerpial stormtroopers. He checks himself swiftly to make sure his gear was all there and in it's proper place. He then angles away from the stormtroopers and heads towards the sound of the cantina's muisc he could hear, he then notices the large windows and decides to take a quick look.

Ren Descends the ramp and enters the Promenade, He still has his duster coat drawn tight and his hat pulled low as he looks around and takes everything in, As he looks around you can now see that he's a human with what looks like a goatee beard, apron seeing the stormtroopers. He instantly checks to make sure that his weapons and his gear was all in there proper place and ready for instant use if the need should arise. He then angles himself away from the stormtroopers and heads towards the sound of the cantina's music he could hear, he then notices that hes not the only being trying to put some distance between them selves and the troopers, taking a quick look back at the troopers, he doesn't notice that the other being decided to take a look out the large windows and walks right into him nearly knocking them both over, after helping to stabilize him on his feet, Ren says, oh Sorry about that, i should have been paying more attention to where i was walking.

The short, slightly built Duros, staggering from the impact by the human, almost slips to the ground. "Excuse you, sir," Elor exclaims, turning to face the goateed human. "You should be more careful in the future or you could injure someone," he states, while adjusting the strap on his left glove.
After saying as much Elor decides that as he doesn't want to get slammed into again, he might as well head to the cantina for a drink. He begins in that direction.

Amongst the meandering stream of passerby you notice two men loitering on the Promenade who do not appear to be a part of the larger crowd. Each seems to be scanning the crowd closely as though looking for someone, though they pay no attention to you.

"Two men whispering on comlinks, and with hidden blasters..." thought the Duros to himself. Something was definitely wrong with that picture, as such was probably out of place on the Promenade. Elor decided this bore further inspection. He was normally good at "blending in," even though he was not a humanoid. Such talent would come in handy here. He attempts to watch the two strangely acting men without being seen.

O'rayn looks up at the two men. Thinking to himself.*"If those two gentlemen are trying to go unnoticed they are doing a very bad job of it."* Flipping throw the Holonet news and Impireal PR O'rayn grows boarded with it and trys to finish reading the tech manual he had started, just because the Emporer decsided he could go to school doesn't mean that he can't keep educating himself. "Waitress, I would like a cup of caf please." He says with a smile. The galaxy was becoming an unwelcome place for Twi'leks and other nonhumans. " Thank you." O'rayn says to the waitress as she brings him his drink. "Well might as well look throw the want adds and try to find a job around here. Of course after I finish my caf and my reading."

Ren also notice the Two men that seem out of place, even though they are wearing normal clothing he also notice that both men are carries a hidden hold-out blaster tucked into his jackets. not liking what he see even though they seem not to be looking for him, Ren decide that he need to take his coat off for ease of moment, Ren move out of the line of predation to a nearby wall and leans his small carry-on bag and his sporting blaster rifle with a scoop against the wall, Ren then takes off coat and folds it up and puts it in the carry-on bag, he then slings the bag over one shoulder and the Rifle over the other. Ren then turns around to reenter the crowd, but also Revealing more of his features thus increasing the risk that he will be recognize as a clone.

After gawking out the large windows like a common tourist, Reka notices the two men hanging out in the Promenade. He shrugs and and mutters something to himself about being more careful with concealing weapons and decides now is a good time for some caf, so he makes his way over to the cantina closest to him. When there he makes his way to an unoccupied table and orders his drink, scanning the crowd as he does so. When he is served his drink he sips it carefully studying his surroundings. "Well now if I can only find some work." he says to himself and sighs.

Only a few brief moments pass before a woman with short black hair and a greasy uniform of a mechanic comes stumbling onto the Promenade, clutching her midsection as though injured. She struggles to make her way across the floor towards the cantina entrance, though clearly she is having difficulty walking.
"Please help me," she calls out to the nearest patrons, "there are credits in it for you, just help me!"
Mere seconds later, two stormtroopers burst into the area from the south end of the Promenade. They raise their blasters, aiming them at the woman, and shout through their helmet speakers, "Step away from that woman. She is under arrest in the name of the Emperor!"
The two plain clothed men start their way towards the cantina as well, fighting against the tide of fleeing station inhabitants.

The Duros, seeing the spectacle breaking out in front of him, decides that if someone is wanted by stormtroopers, they can't be all bad. Not to mention the possibility of credits...he pulls his blaster and sets it on "stun."
Elor begins moving toward the struggling woman. If he is able to reach her before the troopers, he grabs onto her, steadying her gait, and asks in basic, "Do you have somewhere close by we could lay low? "
*OOC…not sure how far I am from the lady, MS, so that might be 2 or three rounds of actions listed above.*

*Lorsic makes notice of the two men who seem to be searching for someone, but tries not to draw attention to himself as he moves toward the Cantina. As Lorisic is walking to the cantina he sees the distressed women calling for help and the Stromtroopers with there blasters at the ready.*
*A Cloaked humanoid comes to help the women, he tries to provide assistance. Up close you see it is a human, with scruffy facial hair, but his words seem kind and genuine.*
**Lorsic**,"Don't worry My name is Lorsic, your going to be okay, I am here to help."
*Lorsic tries to calm her down with words at the same time providing cover towards the Stormtroopers if they decide to actually fire.*
*Lorsic turns to the Stormtrooper that commanded that we move away from the girl.*
**Lorsic**,"I'm sorry, I can't do that. I am stubborn that way, especially when grunts like yourself think you can bully your way through any fight. I think you may want to take a look around, there are more than two blasters pointed at you now."
[OOC: Sorry guys I didn't know we started, I would have responded earlier. Looks like blasters are already blazing, but I would have liked to have gotten those words in before the shots go off.]

"Great I am here two minutes and some fool has to see if he is immune to blaster fire." O'rayn puts away his stuff and stands up moves forward toward the troopers pulling his blaster. " You know it would be a whole lot easyer if you Imp. fools would just learn to be nicer. Can't you see the lady needs help not a blaster bolt." O'rayn says to the troopers with alot of malice in his voice. "It is disturbing that a man can't not finish a cup of caf with interuption." O'rayn stands behind the troopers blaster rasied to fire.

A stun blast from one of the Stormtroopers narrowly misses the wounded woman who is now leaning on Elor for support. This is quickly followed by lethal blaster fire from one of the disguised men, which again misses the woman and her would-be saviors. "Don't kill the woman you idiot!" shouts the Stormtrooper who fired the stun blast. Just then a lethal blast from the second Imperial imformant streaks past Ren's head and tears a burning hole into the back of a fleeing civilian. Disregarding the near miss Ren fires on the Stormtroopers hitting the vocal one square in the chest. He drops his blaster carbine and slumps to the ground. Hearing someone shouting maliciously behind him, the other Stormtrooper turns and fires on O'Rayn hitting him above the knee. Unbeknownst to O'Rayn he's very fortunate that the Empire sends its rookies to Sel Zonn station and this rookie was too rattled to switch from stun.
[*O'Rayn - subtract 2 hit points for the stun attack*]

"Hold on, lady..." Elor exclaims as he returns fire with his blaster at the disguised human that had fired upon them only seconds earlier. After firing his blast, the Duros looks around to see if there is anything on the Promenade that could give he and the female any cover. *OOC If there is any cover around, he will move towards it as well.*

[OOC: Lorsic won't hurt any innocent people, so if he doesn't have line of sight he will not do this action. He will also try to get both if he can, again if the opponents are not within range of the power then he will not do this action.

Reka sees the mess out in the Promenade area and decides quickly that he will take aim at the two undercover men who tried to blast the woman and failed, he takes aim at the closest one and fires his heavy blaster, which he pulled from concealment beneath his cloak. Meanwhile he too will be moving toward the woman and Elor and offering assistance to her, and of course cover fire with his handy heavy blaster.

Se-Fi watched as the newly arrived transport docks with Sel Zonn Station. From her place at the Promenade's cantina bar, the pretty Cerean watched as it's passengers poured out of the starship and began blending into the crowd. Thankfully, her plain clothes were doing a good job of making her just as disinteresting as the average tourist. She left most of her nicer clothes behind on Coruscant; after years of working as a policewoman, the uniformed look kind of grew on her and this bland gray sleeveless shirt and pants combination she chose to leave the planet with was as close as she could get to recreating it. Still, the outfit 'just fit', showing off the natural curves of her body that her old, thicker uniform was designed to disguise. The only reason most of the men on the station weren't interested in her were the two shiny, well-maintained guns Se-Fi proudly displayed holstered at her hips, holdovers from her days in the force - gifts from former co-workers, in fact, with the anti-droid gun coming from a former suitor.
When she reminded herself of her co-workers, Se-Fi immediately returned to the task she was doing before she got distracted by the ship's arrival. She continued scanning the area for anyone she even remotely recognized. Specifically, she was looking for any one for her former 'arrests' that had fled Coruscant once the Empire began it's crackdown on crime. After all, if she was going to try and find other people to try and fight the Empire with, who better to start with than the crooks that hate it the most? And she knew from experience in tracking them down that Sel Zonn was the most likely place they'd hole up in. In previous years, allying herself with criminals would've been out of the question, but after her Cerean binary brains had struggled with the issue, she decided that the only criminals in the galaxy were the so-called Emperor and his minions. Personally, she felt betrayed by the ex-Chancellor; Se-Fi could still remember the days of the Clone Wars when he seemed to struggle with every strategic decision he had to make. Now, there was no longer any doubt in her mind that 'kindly old Palpatine' had somehow pulled the wool over everyone's eyes. By now, she assumed that every one of the Jedi she had worked with, Jedi she had had the privilege to call a friend, had been captured or killed. Their only crime? Being Jedi.
Her species' natural intuition made her quickly set her sights on the woman that entered the cantina - the woman clutching her abdomen. Se-Fi immediately sensed trouble, and that trouble came in the form of two jarheads in their polished white armor coming in after her. As soon as one brave Duros began to assist the woman, followed by the sound of blaster fire, the officer of the Republic began to move. Whoever this woman's saviours were, they were definitely the kind of people she had been hoping to find.
In the commotion of people trying to get out of the cantina, Se-Fi's cool-under-pressure personality pushed her to act in another manner, and another direction. She stepped up and over the bar for cover, dispersing the various utensils as she did so. She called the attention of the Duros by yelling in the man's own tongue, "" She gestured for them to come to her place behind the bar, as she drew her carbine in an attempt to fortify the cantina from Imperial aggression. Se-Fi knew she'd relish her experience; this would be the first time in her life she'd ever do anything so rebellious.
(Se-Fi's not your stereotypical Noble, guys. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> Move action to move behind the bar for cover, second move action to draw her carbine, stock-folded by default.)

With lightning speed Elor returns fire on the Imperial Informants, narrowly missing. He then notices a Cerean clearing bottles and glasses off the bar top offering him and the woman cover. With most civilians already long gone from the Promenade, Lorsic has a clear view of the two Informants. Calling on the force the two men are smashed into each other head first, their unarmored heads contacting with a loud wet thud. They connect mid air before bouncing apart from the sheer force of the attack and falling to the ground amidst the remaining blaster fire. Across the Promenade O'Rayn fires point blank at the rookie Stormtrooper. The trooper falls to the ground with a smoking hole between his eyes.
Before Elor can even decide whether to take cover behind the bar, the injured woman says, "No, we must leave. Reinforcements will be here soon. I have quarters onboard the station. Take me there and I'll explain everything." With that she leaves Elor's support and remains standing, albeit on shaky legs. She begins making her way for the exit out of the Promenade.

Surprised by the reserves of strength of this woman, the Duros falls in line behind her, holstering his blaster pistol, and making a fidgeting tug at his left glove. "Thanks for the help, everyone. I could have handled the troopers, but the other two would have made things hairy," Elor blusters, unsure actually if he actually could have handled two stormtroopers alone.
"Let's get out of here...quickly" he thought, especially seeing someone using one of those magical Force powers he had heard about in whispers. He knew that would attract unwanted attention.

After witnessing the Force display by the one Human, Se-Fi is convinced he's a Jedi. This fact alone excites her, but her excitement is further heightened by the sight of a Republic Clone Trooper in civilian clothing. She'd never seen a Jedi and a Clone Trooper on the same team since the Clone Wars; if such a pair could work together again, perhaps there truly was hope for the galaxy yet.
She stood up as soon as the last Imperial fell by the Twi'lek's blaster. She pointed her carbine around the room, panning to see if there were any other threats. As soon as she heard the woman say they needed to get out quickly, Se-Fi had no protests. Keeping her carbine pointed low in a position reminiscent of her days in delegate guard-duty, the Cerean jogged her way beside the woman. She couldn't believe this woman could still somehow walk on her own.
Her reply to the Duros' word of thanks was "Not a problem, spacer. Just keep on your toes. We'll put away our blasters when we're clear of the cantina." Se-Fi turned to the direction of the Jedi and the Clone Trooper, before turning to the Duros. "Nothing to worry about, the Republic's on top of *this* situation."

Moving quickly with the rest O'rayn thinks back to what just happened. *" Just got here and already I'm on the run, must be going soft. All that clean living."* " So where we headed?

Elor was a bit taken aback by the presence of the self described "Republic officer." Her plain clothes belied the effect she had on the Duros. Although only knowing her for roughly 15 seconds, Elor was compelled for listen and believe her words. He noticed that he was not the only one--she clearly had a way to get the attention of the room.
As to the others, they all looked a bit rough. They were clearly no strangers to a fight, the way they took care of the troopers in quick fashion. It appeared they had no love for the Empire, either. And a real Jedi in person is a sight Elor never thought his large green eyes would ever see.

Reka falls in behind the injured woman and the Duros, he was disappointed in the fact that he didnâ€™t get a chance to blast one of the plainclothes Imperials or even one of the stormtroopers, but he decided not to dwell on that at the moment. His heart was racing and he was keeping a sharp eye out for any trouble, holding his blaster at the ready. Now his thoughts were more centered on who this group of people were and what he had gotten himself into, he decides that he will walk and talk, he begins by speaking with the Duros in front of him, â€œMy name is Reka by the way, Reka Zarus. I just landed here minutes ago, Iâ€™m not sure what this is all about, but Iâ€™m willing to help where I can.â€ With that he just continues on with the group.

Without turning her sights away from keeping an eye out for danger, Se-Fi listened in on the introductions. "Se-Fi, Republic Enforcer, Coruscant Division. Retired," she replied. Responding to the question from the Twi'lek behind her, she said over her shoulder, "We're heading for this woman's safehouse. Keep close." Her tone screamed 'professional'. Despite looking more diplomat than soldier, her stance said the same thing too.

*Lorsic's use of the force has now made him a beacon. Laying low is usually difficult for Lorsic when he sees injustice or suffering, and he knew the quicker this disturbance was dealt with the faster he could get out of sight. He cloaks himself quickly and follows the steps of the injured women. He keeps vigilance for anymore casual clothed patrons that may match the two that have attacked them in the cantina.
Lorsic eyes the clone trooper with distrust, confused why a clone trooper is in casual clothing Lorsic settles his mind and searches his feelings trying to sense if staying with him is an immediate threat to himself. Saving the injured lady could be a trap, he has escaped more clever and fallen to ones less, and caution is why he has survived so long.* 
*Lorsic shares an uncertain look at the female Cerean's statement.* 
**Lorsic responds to the male Twi' Lek with an affirmative nod**."I might have attracted more unwanted attention."

"I'm just glad for your help, whoever you all are," says the woman as she leads you slowly through corridors and elevators. A short twenty minutes later you make it to her hideout on the station. Surprisingly, you've encountered no Imperial forces since leaving the Promenade. They must be searching the more populated areas first. The woman hurriedly punches a code into the door panel and beckons everyone into safe quarters before shutting and locking the door behind her. She stumbles over to a chair and slides into it with a look of agony. The dark stain on her shirt seems to be growing.
"Once again, I thank you all for aiding me. My name is Maya and I am indebted to you. I'm not sure why such a diverse bunch would choose to come together, but in doing so you saved my life. You may have saved a great deal more. I am an agent of Alderaanian security and part of Sentor Bail Organa's personal security detail. I was on a mission here at Sel Zonn when those Imperial goons found me. I guess being a vocal opponent of the Empire gets you flagged as a troublemaker. Ha...oohhh."
Maya places her hand on her wound applying what little pressure she can. A small groan passes her lips.
"I promised credits and you will receive far more than you ever dreamed. Senator Organa is one of the wealthiest men in the entire galaxy. It doesn't take a genius to realize I'm not going to complete the mission. Do so for me and you will be very well rewarded. It will make Senator Organa very happy indeed. It has the added benefit of harming the Empire if that sort of thing matters. What do you say?"

O'rayn looks around at the other people in the room."Harm the Empire you say, hmmmm." Hand on his chin, O'rayn seems to thinking it through. "Well Sentor Organa is a fair man and I can use the credits, sure why not. Job propects are kind of going to dry up here anyway."
O'rayn looks down at the woman "Frist lets get you tended to, does anyone have any medical training. That wound is not going to heal it self." "Names O'rayn by the way." he says putting away his blaster. O'rayn turns to Lorsic. "Can't you do anything. Can't Jedi heal people and all that mistical stuff you guys do."

As the woman lead them through the alleyways of Sel Zonn, Se-Fi had put away her blaster. The Trooper's introduction had confirmed what she thought - if anyone was to be sure of a man's status as a Jedi, it would be a Clone. Now that she had no worries about being detected, her attention shifted to the well-being of the woman they had escorted to safety.
Se-Fi knelt beside the woman and held her hand as a gesture of compassion. Her face betrayed a look of sadness as Maya endured the pain brought on by her own elocution. The ex-cop wanted to tell Maya to save her strength and rest, but the words coming from the woman's mouth were of far greater importance than her own.
"Senator Bail Organa? Of Alderan?" Se-Fi repeated, just to be sure she had the same person in mind. She knew from the rumor mill that Senator Organa had also left the confines of Coruscant at the formation of the Empire, but she had not heard of anything else about the man. This was the first time in a while she had received any news of the good Senator, and she was glad to finally know for certain that she was not alone in her chosen cause.
"I am an Enforcer, sworn to uphold the laws of the Republic. If the Senator asks for my support against this corrupt Empire, he shall have it, and the Republic's restoration shall be my reward."
The words came from her mouth like an oath, and Se-Fi meant every word. It was one of the few things in her life that her binary brains didn't have to think about at length before committing to.
"Now, lay back, Maya, and let me see your wound. If one of you has medical training as well, I request your assistance."

Elor had heard the name Senator Organa before. Everyone knew that Senator Organa was indeed a very wealthy man. Combine that with the fact that they could oppose the Empire, and Elor was quick to volunteer as well. "Count me in as well. I have no love for the Empire...and I do have love for credits, the gangly Duros said, to try to lighten the tense mood of the room.
He stayed far away from Maya and Se _Fi, as Elor was no help in that arena. He had a not-so-funny habit of somehow making injuries worse when he tried to treat them...

"My name is Reka Zarus, I spent some time serving in the military where I am from and I know a little about treating wounds too." He then moves forward to look at the woamn and to see if he could do anything for her.
"Now hold still while I take a look. Perhaps while I am treating the wound you could fill us in on what this is all about, I'm very interested in hurting the Empire in any way, shape or form." he says to Maya and looks her in the eye, with a slight, tight smile on his face.

> Ren the looks in Lorsic dedication and says, Sir i would be more careful where and to who you display your gifts to in these Dark Times.

**Lorsic answers to Ren**,"Subtly in the face of danger is sometimes compromised."
*When the group reaches the safe house Lorsic watches how everyone responds to the injured Lady. He has just witnessed selflessness and kindness in these strangers, a Jedi trait, and realizes it has been a long time since he has seen such acts. So much death in the clone wars makes one jaded, but they are different and he notices this right away; especially the clone trooper.
Lorsic listens to Maya intently, he slowly paces the room glancing at everyone as they respond to her. Lorsic especially takes more than one noticeable glance at the Clone Trooper that has somehow crossed his path, or maybe has found him. An agent of the empire, or bounty hunter, Lorsic thinks, but he could not answer this, and knew he could not trust him. The others seem genuine, and he silently makes his approvals to himself as they introduce themselves and show their kindness. They all seem to believe he is a Jedi, and that means anyone on the Promenade would assume the same. A foolish tactic Lorsic thinks to himself, but he convinces himself quickly that it was worth the risk. If Maya is telling the truth, and she is working with the Senator, then Senator Organa can be the key to finding the missing Jedi. The force has guided him to her now he must follow the path.*
> O&#39;rayn turns to Lorsic. &quot;Can&#39;t you do anything. Can&#39;t Jedi heal people and all that mistical stuff you guys do.&quot;

**Lorsic looks at O'rayn with a curious look**,"Do not let parlor tricks fool you, I am no Jedi, but I am afraid my display may put you all at more risk. My name is Lorsic, and I am sorry I can not help with any Mystical healing powers, but I can assist in the treatment of the Medpac."
*Lorsic was not lying, he was not a Jedi and barely learning the ways of the force, but this could not be known to any who witness the power of the force and do not understand what it is to be a Jedi. To some it is just a generalized title, but Lorsic knows what is a true Jedi, and Lorsic was not a Jedi. He has been with out the guidance of a Master for some time, and it has sent him down a different path. This is the dangerous path he walks, and he was constantly trying to heed his padawan teachings.*
**Lorsic**,"Maya, Tell us of your mission, I think we all have our reasons to help. Tell us what is going on here. You mentioned credits, I'm sure some of us are interested in your offer."
*After the fall of the Jedi Temple credits were hard to come by, and Lorsic was no stranger to taking them when offered.*

Those tending Maya's wounds quickly realize that they have no way of healing her.
Maya gently pushes away her rescuers. "No, no don't worry about it me. It' too late to do anything for me. Well, in the first aid sense. I've got a contact on the station who can get me some personal time with a bacta tank. Now listen up, this is important. Some cargo was recently shipped from the Deep Core. This cargo is invaluable to our efforts. It's being held by a droid named Switch down in deep storage bay V14. Meet with Switch, keep a low profile, and retrieve this cargo. When you have it contact me. I'll have transport off this station ready by that time. There's a station computer terminal down the hallway outside. The area is off-limits, but you can get directions and info on how to get in from a terminal hopefully. Learn from my mistake and remember to duck."
With that Maya struggles to her feet and staggers towards a closet. She pulls out what appears to be a disguise and starts donning it.

Se-Fi stood up and nodded as Maya instructed them on what to do. The task seemed simple enough; she would only have to be concerned about nosy Imperials. One thing did strike her enough to ask, however: "If the droid is expecting you in person, how are we supposed to identify ourselves as your representatives? Do we just tell it you sent us, or will it be expecting a code of some sort?"

When reaching the terminal O'rayn goes to work. He starts to look for the information that they need to do the job, so they can get off the station alive.

"...Theres about 200 credits for each of you on there. That should be enough. You want more you can ask Bail Organa. He's the philanthropist, not me. As for the droid, he runs - well - its some sort of information brokerage really. He might need some convincing. Judging by your bang up job on the Promenade you can be convincing.

The computer terminal hums to life. All inquiries about Deep Storage Bay V14 only reveal that is off limits and has been quarantined for over one and a half years. After a few minutes of slicing the terminal reveals that absolutely no maintenance requests have been filed for that section during the entire quarantine, with no mention of why it was quarantined. A few more seconds of typing brings up a station schematic that shows Deep Storage Bay V14 is located along one of the stations main exhaust systems. Exhaust conduits must run through the storage bay.

Se-Fi watches silently as Maya prepares her disguise. She herself had done some plainclothes and undercover work, but never alone. She had to admire the resilience of this woman, going back out into the open right after sustaining a bleeding chest wound. Hopefully, they would be able to retrieve whatever the important cargo was while Maya spent time in a bacta tank.
She nods as O'rayn comes in with the map data from the outside terminal. It seems odd that such important cargo would be sealed in a quarantined, unmaintained area of the station with it's only guardian being a droid. "Exhaust ports it is then," she says. "I think I can handle Switch; I've dealt with paid informants before, but this'll be the first time I'd have to deal with a droid in that manner."
Se-Fi tapped the polished ion pistol on her hip. "I'm not sure if droids know fear, but this ought to help, if necessary."

Whatever this cargo is, hopefully it's small enough to transport out of the sealed area without a cargo-lift."

"I hope the droid's standing outside the storage bay with an access code. Otherwise, one of you will have to slice that security door open.

You follow the station schematics down the corridors before reaching the appropriate lift. Many levels down you exit the cramped elevator and notice this level is nothing like the ones above. Zone V14 has been left neglected. Many of the lights have burnt out, and blaster marks and carbon scoring mar the walls, ceilings and floor. The area reeks of ozone and electrical fires, and pools of coolant litter the hallways at regular intervals. Even more surprising is that the section is void of life. No civilians and no imperial presence whatsoever. The corridors of this zone are a labyrinth of twisting hallways, but using the schematic as a guide you take little time in finding Deep Storage Bay V14. As you reach the end of a corridor you spot two Gamorreans wielding vibro-axes standing guard at the entrance to Deep Storage Bay V14. They are deep in a conversation full of grunts and squeals. For the moment you are still out of sight.

It was one of those days that Se-Fi wished she'd studied Gamorrean. It was just unfortunate that such muscle-bound non-Basic-speaking lowlifes usually ended up as guards to more intellectual lowlifes. In this case, that lowlife just so happened to be a droid.
She wanted to stop Lorsic from moving ahead of them, as it seems he momentarily forgot that he was just one of six people trying to see Switch, and practically all six of them were armed (the Force was weapon enough, in her mind, in case the Jedi had no lightsaber). If she were one of the Gamorreans, she'd be suspicious too. Se-Fi was starting to regret not pushing for the exhaust as their entry point. Now, it looked like it was up to her to defuse the situation - the others evidently didn't know enough of the underworld to act like they fit in - even the Twi'lek (criminal profiling was a highly discriminatory activity). It was a thought that reflected her more than it did them, and that was somewhat disconcerting.
Se-Fi immediately raised her open palms a bit to show that she and others weren't going to try anything as she came up to the Gamorreans. "Sorry to bother you boys, but we're stuck in a situation where all of us want to get in, and none of us can speak your language," she began. "So I'll tell you what: you let that man go in with an escort, and the rest of us will stay out here where you two strong men can keep an eye on us, okay? Nod if you agree, and shake if you don't, or use a vox-box if you've got one."

"Thanks a lot," she replied to the droid voice as well as the Gamorreans. She looked at the others with a more relaxed look, though no less alert, and said, "Well, shall we?"

The deep storage bay is as run-down as the hallways leading up to it, with entire metal plates missing from the floor and huge, open exhaust shaft near the back of the room. Large crates litter the area, creating the appearance of a haphazard mess, and the air has the distinct smell of sweat and fumes that makes the entire area unpleasant. Flickering lights provide modest illumination, and a burst pipe along the ceiling leaks blue fluid down one wall.
Near the center of the room is an item that seems very out of place - a large, finely crafted desk made of Japor ivory wood, which means the desk is both priceless and rare. Sitting peacefully behind the desk is a protocol droid with shiny, ebony coverings that seem to soak up light and offer only the slightest reflection. The droid's eyes flicker slightly, as though imitating a person blinking rapidly.
As you approach the desk you notice a small blue-and-red astromech droid beeping away quietly, seemingly lost in it's own world. As you draw closer you observe several of the protocol droid's thugs and associates scattered about the bay, not hiding but also not clearly visible. This includes a Twi'lek standing queitly off to one side.
The protocol droid waits until you stand directly in front of his desk before addressing you in a cheerful and light voice.
"Greetings, I am Switch and I welcome all business. I am unaware of any standing contracts for anybody named O'Rayn, but anything can be gained for the right price. Oh, where are my manners. May I offer you refreshment? I have the finest wines from around the galaxy and R5-B8 would be glad to fetch it for you." With that the astromech droid burbles in agreement.
"Where was I? Yes, whatever it is you seek can be obtained for a reasonable fee. Tell me, what are you looking for?"

Elor always made it a point to not drink and pilot. However, it didn't look like there was any worry about that for the time being, so the Duros decided he maight as well partake of the hospitality of the droid. "I don't much about wine, but I could certainly deal with a cup of Jawa juice, if you have any handy, while we are discussing business."
The duros, after placing an order, looked around the room, making sure no one was taking any threatening actions. He paid particular attention to the Twi'lek in the shadows, to see if anything in particular stood out about it.

"Nothing for me right now, thank you," Se-Fi tells the enthusiastic little R5 unit. She did drink, socially, and seldom, but never while on duty. It was easy for her to contend that the moment they accepted this assignment from Maya, she had once again gone into active duty. Hence, she was now on a strict "no hard drinks" fasting.
The Cerean raised her head up as she showed a hopefully disarming smile. Despite her show of weaponry, she made sure to keep her hands where the guards in the room could plainly see them at all times. It was a very bad place to start a fight - and risking their lives needlessly would've been counter-productive to their mission.
She did say she would handle Switch, so Se-Fi took lead this time, stepping up to the droid's desk but keeping a respectable distance away. Who could say if touching the antique desk wouldn't tick off the droid?
"Greetings, Switch. Nice desk you have there. Japor ivory wood? Now that's classy," she began, hoping to start negotiations on a friendlier footing.
"Anyway, I know you've probably got a lot of business to attend to, so we won't waste your time. My friend O'Rayn here may not have a standing contract with you, but we *are* interested in doing business. You see, we've recently heard that a certain 'special cargo' from the Deep Core has recently come to your possession, and we're interested in finding out more about it. If we find it interesting enough, we'll consider acquiring it."

"Oh, what a shame. I do apologize. At least I can provide this special cargo you speak of. Usually information comes out of the core and black market goods come in. This seems to be going against the grain, and this cargo is quite special. I could be persuaded to part with it for 1000 credits. Unfortunately, the desk is not for sale.

"Oh, that is a shame," says Switch in his cheerful tone. "1000 credits is an eminently reasonable sum for cargo of this importance. Perhaps I could reduce the rates in exchange for guarantees of future infor..."
Switch is cut off by squeals and blaster fire sounds from outside in the hall, and suddenly the blast doors leading into the storage bay slide open to reveal a number of armed thugs outside. In the midst of the rabble is a large Chevin, his trunk hanging low to the ground and his mouth twisted in a snarl. A blaster pistol in his hand and two dead Gammoreans behind him are evidence of his seriousness.
"So you thought you could hide your deal with the off worlders from me droid? I'm tired of not getting my cut! turn him into a scrap heap boys!"
With that Switch dives behind his desk.

The moment the sound of blaster fire exploded from the entrance, Se-Fi once again sprung into action as though she herself had the Force-strengthened instincts of the late Cerean Jedi Master Ki-Adi Mundi. Her species' near-precognitive sense told her to take cover behind the desk, ducking right beside Switch.
Se-Fi couldn't believe her ears when she heard O'rayn trying to talk his way when blasters weren't just drawn, but had already been shot. She could've taken out her comlink and called for backup with "Shots fired!" at this point, but she was no longer on Coruscant, and no longer a part of the police force. Their little anti-Empire group was all she had.
"Take cover and pin them down!" she called out.

He watches the battlefield as it unfolds and pays particular attention to his companions; making sure they don't get themselves killed. This is not the kind of fight Lorsic wants to get in the middle, but Switches cargo is important. He will act if things turn for the worse.

O'Rayn's speech is punctuated by a massive volley of blaster fire, and the Twi'lek is too busy taking cover to notice lekku at the moment. Meanwhile, Se-Fi's shout seems to drive even the most hardened of the group with an urge to take out these thugs. The old Chevin scurries for cover while his goons fire upon you.
Reka takes out a thug with his heavy blaster, dropping their number to six. One of the Chevin's thugs takes the opportunity to shoot the unprepared O'Rayn. The blaster bolt sears through the Twi'leks flesh causing massive damage, but somehow leaves O'Rayn standing. Another blaster bolt impacts with the crates providing Elor cover causing sparks to shower into the air and the richochet takes out one of Switch's goons near Lorsic. Ren's auto-fire sprays uncontrolled amongst the thugs near the blast doors mostly striking the floor and walls. Some of the spray manages to take out two thugs shearing through limbs and leaving charred torsos. The few thugs working for Switch who aren't simply hiding behind cover somehow manage to fire well wide of any enemies. Amidst this poor marksmanship the Chevin slips into the storage bay and hides amongst the crates. Blaster fire from two thugs begins to rip apart Switch's fine Japor wood desk, in an attempt to eliminate the droid's only cover.
"Remember our deal Twi'lek!!!" shouts the old Chevin. Those close enough to Switch's majordomo, the Twi'lek, hear him utter a curse amongst the din of combat. "Fire on the newcomers!" bellows the Twi'lek and all eyes turn to you. Another six thugs have just joined the other side leaving your group, Switch, and the little R5 on the short end of a double-cross.

For all her intuition, Se-Fi didn't expect this double-cross to occur - at least not at this particular point in time. She immediately drew her blaster, making a quick scan of the room for the best targets to lay down fire upon. As the blaster bolts whizzed above her cone-shaped head, her two brains told her she had two options:
One, she could set the weapon to autofire and attack any three or four thugs clustered together, or two, she could drag Switch down to make themselves prone while she took a single snap shot at the nearest visible threat.
In a split-second, she made a decision. Either way, she knew, the desk was history.

Se-Fi's quick instincts realize there isn't a group of three or more adversaries clumped together and at the same moment it registers in her brains she has fired the blaster carbine taking out a thug nearby. From behind cover, the grinning Reka fires at a thug trying to sneak up on Switch and O'Rayn. The blaster fire impacts into the thugs back sending him sprawling to the floor dead. The two thugs by the door continue to fire on the desk trying to demolish it. Their fire hits the Japor wood desk causing burnt splinters to spray into the air. Groans and creaks from the huge desk make it clear it won't survive much more blaster fire. Lorsic picks up the thugs blaster, clearly worn and uncared for, and fires on a thug who has taken up a rear guard near the exhaust tubes. Despite having no training he manages to score a hit that slams into the thug's shoulder forcing him to the ground. One of Switch's former thugs fires at Ren, but the shot strays off and takes out a nearby crate full of wine. Ren sprays the two thugs firing on the desk, once again mowing everyone in his sights down with lethal hail of blaster fire. O'Rayn takes aim on the Twi'lek majordomo and fires point blank. The sound of a wet slap and crackle, then a smoking hole in the Twi'lek's head. The dead traitor slides down the crates to the ground. Elor spots the Chevin hurrying from one batch of crates to another as he makes his way towards Switch. Elor takes the chance and fires on the Chevin. The shot pierces the scaly hide of the Chevin's arm. An angry grunt followed by a wild blaster shot are his only response. Another thug fires on Elor, but only manages to damage a nearby crate.

Se-Fi takes aim on a thug advancing on the desk and takes him out with a single blast. Reka, heart racing from the battle, manages to take down another thug. Lorsic spots a thug approaching the desk and plants a blaster shot into his back, sending the thug toppling over. One of the remaining thugs manages to fire on the desk reducing it finally into a pile of debris. Ren, realizing that only one thug remains, calmly switches to single fire and take out the remaining thug with lethal efficiency. Both O'Rayn and Elor spot the Chevin at the same moment and fire, scoring hits that burst into his scaly hide. With a loud thud the Chevin crashes to the floor only a few meters from the desk debris and Switch.
The droid's pleasant voice replaces the sounds of blaster fire. "He is quite dead. Most excellent! While I'm disappointed by my former employee's lack of loyalty I couldn't be more thrilled by your aid. I'm truly indebted to you. Oh, a real shame," Switch stands up and and appears to examine his desk for a moment amidst the roughly dozen dead. "this desk was so priceless."
The little astromech droid rolls up to his master as Switch continues, "As I said I am indebted to you. That nasty piece of Chevin was Ganga Lor, my chief rival. Apparantly he tired of my presence here. I'm so dreadfully sorry you had to get in the middle of our little dispute, but your timing couldn't have been better for me. As payment, I'll gladly give you the location of the cargo you seek. It is stashed in the main cargo bay on Blue deck. Be forewarned, it's the landing port for the imperials and the whole section is full of Imperials and loyalists. The non-humans and the Clone, while very fascinating, should keep there faces hidden. Anti-human sentiment runs high, and I don't think your display earlier on the Promenade won you too many supporters in Blue deck. Also, I'll have a medic here shortly to tend to your wounds."

Se-Fi secures her carbine in its holster as soon as she hears the last bolt fizzle out of existence. Peering around the room to see the carnage - rather one-sided - the Cerean gracefully stands up from the ground, now very happy to have left her better looking dresses back on Coruscant. She dusts herself off, quietly recomposing herself after the rush of battle; she acts as if she had just finished another successful shift of her police work in the most professional manner anyone could ever do so, while looking all the prettier for it.
She listens to Switch's explanation, thankful that they didn't have to negotiate any further. She is, however, a bit appalled to see her allies demeaning themselves by looting corpses, but she doesn't say anything. After all, she was raised a noble and always had virtually everything she needed. It is evident that these men did not (except for the Clone - she knew he was just being practical, as they were trained to be in the field), and for the second time in her life, she quietly berates herself for coming from riches.
For a moment, Se-Fi wonders how she'd hide herself with her tall cone-shaped head. With her skull as part of the equation, she is much, much taller than the other members of their rag-tag team. She feels that disguising herself is nearly out of the question. Even with the hood of her cloak, her height would still make her stand out as non-Human.
Unless...
"Switch, you wouldn't happen to have the latest in noble's clothing from the Core, now would you? You know, those crazy Human styles with the big head of hair that's always the rage on Naboo? Oh, and a lavish make-up kit, too. And some semi-precious jewelry, while you're at it."
As she says it, Se-Fi sounds just like a young woman with a no-limit credit chip during a department store sale - the only difference is, the Cerean has a purpose for her purchases.
(Se-Fi will attempt to purchase clothing from Switch to try and make herself look like a Human Noble. If she manages to buy, she'll use a Force Point for the disguise check she'll make - when she's in the privacy of a dressing room, of course.)

Switch remains calm in the flurry of questions and ideas being bandied about. With a hint of indignation he responds, "There are many garment shops on board this station. I am not one of those. If I were you I wouldn't be too worried about going to such lengths over disguises. You have an admirable talent for not leaving witnesses. With so many conflicting accounts the Imperial security forces are still scrambling to piece together the events and those involved. R5 would have alerted me immediately if your pictures were posted on the wanted alerts." With that R5 beeps in a happy affirmation. "I wouldn't wait too long though. As for now, you shouldn't have any trouble on blue deck as long as you don't cause trouble and stay discreet. Aliens are hated and refused service, but you shouldn't be attacked outright. While both the idea to transfer the cargo or to stow away on incoming cargo are both ingenious they are both impossible. Your employer, Maya, pulled in many favors to have the cargo shipped to the Imperial loading bay. She rightly suspected that the cargo would go unnoticed right under their noses. No cargo would be transfered out, and any incoming cargo is scanned for life signs. Which, is quite ironic in my humble opinion."
The sound of shuffling feet from the storage bay entrance alerts you to the presence off a shabby looking human male walking in with a small black bag.
"Ah, Doctor Fenn! So glad you responded so quickly. I have an associate in need of your attention."
"I told you before," grumbles the human, "I'm not a doctor you sith-spawned droid. No matter how many of your goons I patch up, I'm still a veterinarian. So what blasted fool forgot to duck? Never mind, I see the Twi'lek." With that the grizzled Dr. Fenn walks over to O'Rayn kneels down and begins tending his wounds. The good doctor smells strongly of booze and death sticks.
"Uh, thank you Dr. Fenn. Now where was I? Yes, you mentioned a ride. That could do us both great good. I'll gladly give you the details of the cargo, free of charge this one time, in exchange for some further assistance. I too have recently used the blue deck loading bay to move items. With your inherent knack for causing trouble, I fear the cargo bay will have much tighter security by morning. Since you seem to be working for Maya, I assume you'll be making a visit to Alderaan. Presently there is a case of several bottles of Correllian ale in the same storage bay as your precious cargo. Simply transfer this case to Alderaan and the information along with 500 credits will be yours. Are we agreed?"
[The looted bodies offer up nothing in the way of med pacs, or ammo. Each thug carried a blaster pistol (3d6) in a hip holster and a vibro-axe (2d10). Besides his blaster (3d6), the Chevin carried a basic datapad, and 300 credits. The datapad held no vital information though. Little else was found amongst the charred bodies.]

Elor, after listening to Switch's offer, agrees to deliver the Corrliean ale. "500 credits for moving some ale? I think I speak for the group, when I accept on everyone's behalf. Give us the information, and we will get your ale to its owner. I might even not even drink all of it in transit," the Duros says, taking a breath, and sitting on one of the undamaged crates, playing at the glove on his left hand, "Joking, joking," he says after seeing Switch fail to observe the humor in the Duros's attempt.

Se-Fi is a bit disappointed to know that Switch doesn't have a clothing line. She had to scrap that plan - if she tried buying a clothing ensemble out in the open, it wouldn't be too much a disguise. Now, she looked skeptical at the others as they produced equipment from their fallen foes. She didn't judge them for their actions, but...

The Cerean ex-cop listens intently to the Jedi-in-denial's words. "Your concerns are valid, but planning for acquisition and transport would depend on what exactly this special cargo is, M-" she begins, cutting herself off before she says the words 'master jedi'. Instead she smoothly transitions to, "... Mister Lorsic. For all we know, it could be as small as a mouse-droid rather than as large as a shipping crate. Besides, Maya already told us to contact her once we secure the cargo, and she said she'll provide the transport for it. So, let's not get worked up and give Maya all the bacta tank time she can get while we complete our assignment."
She nods to the Duros' direction and turns to Switch, saying, "Of course we'll take your deal, just hand Elor here the credits, and tell us who the ale is for. Now, do please tell us: what is this 'special cargo' that absolutely has to get to Alderaan, and how do we recognize it on Blue deck?"

Switch listens intently to the discussion, his metal head tilted to one side. A programmed indicator of attentiveness. "Ah, but sadly this cargo is larger than a mouse droid. I am very glad you have accepted my offer. The ale is of an excellent year and I'd hate for it to be wasted on Imperial palates. The cargo you seek is actually another Alderaanian agent. From what I've gathered the agent was frozen in carbonite and shipped from the Deep Core word of Empress Teta. The agent apparantly has vital information regarding the Empire and was frozen and shipped as cargo to slip past detection. Cargo is much less likely to be arrested by the Empire after all. And the cargo scanners cannot detect life readings on something in stasis. hopefully, you can determine whether you have a ride or not. If you do I would assume they could arrive at the blue deck loading bay as easily as anywhere else. Security on Sel Zonn is quite lax. Why do you think I chose to set up shop here?"
"He's done," grumbles the veterinarian. "All patched up. I'm going before all these corpses start to stink. Uh, I need a drink." With that Dr. Fenn makes his way out of the storage bay.

The Cerean rubs her vast forehead a bit, obviously seeing something wrong with that statement. "I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks that plan is far too simple to work without a hitch," she says, sighing. Carbonite is definitely no simple matter.

With that the droid nods in agreement. You travel out of the deteriorating Deep Storage bay and find the nearest lift. A few moments later you are on Blue deck. As the turbolift door slides open and you step out onto blue deck, it is like entering a wholly different space station. The floors are polished and possess a metallic sheen, and the massive windows along one wall grant the most magnificent view of Brentaal available on the station. Maintenance and server droids flit about from one place to the next, keeping everything clean and ordered.

He scanned the area around them, trying to note if there were any Imperial Stormtroopers or similar governmental types lurking around close by.

"*It's so… clean,*" Se-Fi comments to herself. She didn't expect to see anything like this on Sel Zonn, but it wasn't an unwelcome sight. Well, at least not the deck itself. The obvious sneering of the stuck-up Humans on this deck was making her a bit skeptical of things. The Empire's pro-Human declarations seemed to have made most of the entire species full of themselves. For her part, she simply tried to remain looking innocuous. To try and hide herself, or to react to the sneering, was tantamount to lowering what she thought of herself and lowering herself to their politically-incorrect level. Se-Fi intended to keep her dignity all throughout this Empire's reign, should she live long enough to see it be defeated.

As you take in the view, you overhear two nobles discussing the main docking bay and your interest picks up. What little you can hear makes it clear that the Empire has just sent an entire squad of Stormtroopers to the main docking bay to check out some suspicious cargo.

The massive hangar smells of exhaust fumes and spilled coolant and appears to have seen quite a bit of activity recently. Crates stand stacked up throughout the hangar, waiting for whatever shuttle is to transport them down to the surface. Three doors lead off the left side of the room; the bottom two are close together, and the top door leads into a control room with a transparent window overlooking the hangar itself.
The carbonite block is clearly visible in the middle of the hangar, however it is attached to a repulsor sled. The speeder is attached to the carbonite block by a tow cable. A squad of 4 Stormtroopers stand guard around the block, while a fifth pilots the repulsor sled. An Imperial Officer overseas the squad as they begin to tow the frozen agent.
As you march into hangar all of the Imperials immediately spot you and level their blaster carbines at you and shout, "Halt!" The trooper operating the repulsor sled detaches the cable and begins to turn the sled in your direction. The junior officer darts behind nearby crates for cover and you can hear him demanding backup on his comlink.

Reka follows Ren into the hanger and seeing the Imperial Stormtroopers, he waits to see what happens. When he hears their command and that they are now pointing blasters at him, Reka draws his heavy blaster and opens fire, aiming specifically at the officer, at the same time he darts to the side looking for cover.

Sefi dives for the nearest cover, even as she inwardly hopes the pilot of the sled wasn't really foolhardy enough to ram them with a full-blown carbonite slab behind him. "Take out the officer and the pilot first!" she commands, beginning to reach out for her carbine as she does so.

The Junior Officer's command is cut short as Reka kills him with well directed blaster fire. The sled reacts shifting directions swiftly on its repulsors firing a net at Reka. The drop net entangles Reka leaving him immobile. Elor, recognizing the inherent danger of a well armed speeder, fires on the sled but narrowly misses as it whirls around in the hangar bay. Lorsic fires into the crowd of Stormtroopers killing one instantly. As O'Rayn huddles behind some crates, he can't help but notice a crate labeled "Corellian Ale". O'Rayn's blaster fire misses the Stormtroopers however. Se-Fi's direction spur on the group as the battle becomes more heated. A Stormtrooper, hearing Se-Fi's commands, fires on her. His shot goes wide and strikes the nearby crates. A Stormtrooper fires on Ren resulting in a mere flesh wound. Ren returns fire on the trooper, striking him dead square between his eyes. The remaining Stormtrooper takes aim at Lorsic hitting him in the shoulder.

Peering around the crates, Se-Fi watches the Stormtrooper squad go down one by one, even as Reka gets caught by an unexpected net attack. She instinctively crawls back to cover when she sees one of them fire in her direction, burning the side of the crate she was hiding behind. Pulling out her trusty sidearm, Se-Fi picks the closest Stormtrooper and opens fire.

*Lorsic watched the battle unfold, particularly noticing that O'rayn was shooting at his own brethren, but failed to hit anything. Lorsic looked down at Ren and thought for a moment to help, but he knew Ren was capable. The real danger was the pilot on the Repulsar Sled and the three troopers still firing with intent to kill, so Lorsic decides to concentrate on the the troopers leaving the pilot to his companions.*

Laying prone and ensnared, Reka's blast misses. The sled pivots on its repulsors and lets loose with a furious barrage at Lorsic with it's auto-cannon. The blasts obliterate the crates providing him cover, and showering him with white hot shrapnel. Within an instant the sled pilot slumps down in the cockpit, dead from Elor's clean head shot. Lorsic recovers from the cannon fire and slams the two remaining Stormtroopers, their armor crumpling from the pressure of the attack. Blood seeps from the cracks in the late troopers' armor. The group's remaining blaster fire pocks the hangar floor. Reka finally manages to struggle free from the net. The smoke clears in the hangar revealing all the Imperials dead.

Even though the last Imperial falls, Se-Fi does not relax. She shifts her position from her side of the crate to the other, covering their entryway. He spies Ren reaching for Maya, and nods in his direction. Turning to O'Rayn, she says, "Get the ale on the sled and secure it."
She had noticed Lorsic use the same 'parlor trick' against the Imperials here as he did back at the cantina. The Cerean has little time to contemplate it, however, as she focused her attention on the entrance to Blue Deck. "Anyone with a free blaster hand help me cover the door. The rest: get that sled ready for the transport."

The crate, though cumbersome, is lifted solely by O'Rayn. It takes both hands, but he's able to move it towards the sled. The crate and its contents seem undamaged.
Meanwhile Ren finds five carbines and five spare power packs on the various troopers. As Ren approaches the Officer he realizes that he was a low ranking lieutenant. On the Imperial Officer he finds a blaster pistol, comlink and a code cylinder. He then contacts Maya who acknowledges their location and declares she has found a ship and is on her way.
Out on Blue deck nothing seems awry. The patrons either didn't hear or ignored the fire fight and go about their activities. All those wealthy people have learned that they have much to lose if they get too nosey regarding Imperial business.
Then the lieutenant's comlink bursts into chatter. "Lieutenant, we have two squads inbound for your location. What is your status? Lieutenant?"

Se-Fi braces her weapon against the edge of the crate for stability, as she waits for the transport. When she hears the sound of the Imperials outside calling to the ones they had just neutralized, she waved Ren over. She would've attempted deceiving them herself, but she was a female Cerean, and didn't feel like she could adequately modulate a male Human's voice. She *did* know the right words to say, however, coaching Ren or whichever of the Humans would try to reply.
"But whatever you say, don't forget to tell them to keep out of the area until we sound an 'all-clear'. That should buy us enough time for the transport to get here," Se-Fi insists.

Se-Fi makes a quick sound of disappointment as the station manager responds that he'll send a maintenance crew over. Even though they didn't manage to dissuade the Imperials from checking things out, they at least had made sure they weren't going to come in guns blazing. That was still a tactically advantageous situation. Hopefully the transport wasn't going to take that long.

The door slams shut as the sound of boots echoes through the halls. They seem to be headed in your direction. Most of the containers in the bay are in large blue containers labeled only with numbers. It would seem only non-Imperial cargo was clearly labeled. One thing does not escape your notice. A dark shape silhouetted against the day side of Brentaal growing closer and closer. Suddenly the sizzles of a plasma torch erupts as the troopers outside begin cutting through the door. Two bright lines of molten door slowly race towards each other.
