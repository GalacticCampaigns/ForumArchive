# [Reality Bytes] Corruption (MG-2099's story)

### **BWS2K** (2011-09-30 22:42:56)

"**You understand that there are certain…risks…involved with a request like yours, do you not, Mr. Wraith?**"
"**I don't care about any risks - what more can they do to me here? Just take care of that stupid droid. I want him to feel the closest thing to pain something like him can feel, and I want him to feel it for a long, *long* time.**"
"**Very well. We'll be in touch. My employers have also asked that I make one last thing abundantly clear: It's only because of your father that they even bothered to send me here today. The Black Sun does not often accomodate special requests from disgraced individuals too inept to handle their own affairs. After this matter is concluded, you will never hear from us again.**"
"**Whatever. Just do it.**"<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

MG-2099's optics register the dark cloud cover on the planet hundreds of kilometers below. Some unusual storm patterns seem to be sweeping across parts of the surface, delaying his shuttle's landing by nearly thirty minutes. For now they are safely in orbit above Corellia awaiting clearance.
"**The captain apologizes for the minor setback, these things do happen. He invites you to partake of the available refreshments in the forward dining area at no charge.**" The protocol droid motions for anyone interested to follow him through the small passageway. Saying a shuttle this size has a dining area is like saying the fresher can seat three comfortably. Even more room wouldn't make up for the lousy food though, and only one passenger, a very round Sullustan with crumbs from his last meal still clinging to his shirt, seems desperate enough to accept the offer. He sets his case under his chair and reaches his destination in just a few short steps.
Across from MG sits a young Twi'lek couple, completely content to have the extra time together and re-define the term "public display of affection". The rest of that side is now empty, the corner seat littered with half-empty bags of the shuttle food. Two seats to his right is a Rodian in a flight suit whose nap isn't interrupted by the captain's generous offer in the least. Three seats to his left a rather gruff Human pours over a datapad - keeping up on the latest local sports scores judging by his occasional shouts. MG rarely has the opportunity to witness so many vulgarities in so many languages in so short a time. Typical travelers prefer landing on the day-side of a planet, but this shuttle is chock full of *atypical* if nothing else. Peering outside the window once more, he sees a large transport break through the clouded atmosphere and setup for a hyperjump. On its side is a faded red and yellow ten-pointed star resting on a pair of sabacc dice. It quickly maneuvers to face away from Corell - the system's own blinding star - and blinks into hyperspace.
MG turns in his seat once more and observes the Twi'lek pair, now at the start of some sort of lovers' quarrel. As he begins to ponder the future uses of his recently acquired fortune, his internal comlink notifies him of an incoming message. The skill it would take to locate MG-2099 and request communication in such a fashion is odd enough, the fact that the message is text-only is even more intriguing. Scanning the message for any dangers, he opens it:
***Apprentice123 wishes to speak with The Wizard. Please acknowledge.***

2099 sits with prim posture, as any good protocol droid should, and watches his companions. He makes sound bytes of each beings voice, storing them for later use. He pays special attention to the female Twi'lek's vocal patterns, recalling one instance on Coruscant of a failed com call to convince a wealthy Twi'lek male to part with a hefty sum of credits in exchange for a rendezvous that would have resulted in his subsequent kidnapping and ransom. As he records her vocal nuances he receives a text only message for his older human male alter-ego, the "Wizard". Beings in his line of work didn't trust or tolerate droids often, so such a ruse was necessary and kept the heat off MG-2099's outer coverings.
He contemplated simply ignoring the message, but decided against it. Further information was required to discern where this being had acquired his com code. He then debated as to how far into character he should go when replying, and decided to keep it simple. He waited another twenty minutes analyzing the Sullustan's food intake and forgotten case, and the human's shouting and cursing.
After the twenty minutes was up he replied in text format, "SPEAK."
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

During the twenty minutes I would like to take 20 and search each person for weapons, so that's five targets at 2 minutes each for ten minutes total, then I would like to take 20 and check out the Sullustan's case for some hint as to what it is or its contents, and another 20 for the Sullustan himself, for an additional 4 minutes total, which would leave 6 to waste. So before I start staring at people and their belongings I want to take one minute to create a simple deceptive appearance of being a inquisitive droid, and take 10 on it. That leaves 5 minutes which will be spent just sitting there doing nothing unless something interesting is turned up by my perception checks.
Deception 12+10=22 I think I may qualify for the +5 from the table from Simple Deception, which would put me at a 27.
Perception 11+20=31 Dark-vision.

***Analysis results:**
Twi&#39;lek, male - named "Orn" according to discarded ticket below seat, breathing and sweat patterns indicate genuine physical enjoyment with partner…
Twi&#39;lek, female - likely named "Kinsa" based on utterings of partner, being referred to as "Carrin" by partner brings about immediate change in attitude…
Rodian, male - possible spice smuggler due to trace amounts of substance visible on flight suit, breathing rate indicates significant exposure to low air quality…
Human, male - easily excited, fascinated with sports, well-traveled based on the variety of languages employed for self-expression, favored team is winning…
Sullustan, male - conflicting results: all evidence concludes a gluttonous, apathetic, middle-class factory worker - presence of scar on right hand and small powder burns on sleeves require further data to eliminate other possibilities…
Sullustan&#39;s case - initial appearance indicates a typical carry-on case, weight calculation based on further audio analysis of its placement before owner's departure concludes contents of considerable mass…*
MG sends his response and receives another message a few moments later:
***Wizard - Parties interested in the future investment of your recently acquired assets wish to discuss several opportunities in-person. Will you agree to meet?***

*Interesting…* MG thinks eying the case and its owner. He receives the newest message and replies, "THE WIZARD MEETS NO ONE. MY AGENTS ARE AVAILABLE THOUGH. YOU MAY CONTINUE."
At noticing the spice on the Rodian he thinks, *Ah yes, the powdered gold these organics crave so. I wonder how many varieties I'll be able to sell on planet?* Upon taking in the human's behavior he ponders the odds of profit in racketeering the local sports, then files it away as needing more research for later. He continues to watch the Sullustan and his case while waiting.

The eating habits of Sullustans has been well-documented but anyone wishing to do so could construct a thesis based solely upon the specimen in the dining area. One would wonder, considering the state of his crumb-covered apparel, if his case wasn't just crammed full of some sort of dense super-food that he could just snack on constantly when not sleeping. Observing him for several minutes, MG spots the protocol droid rise and make a further announcement:
"**The captain wishes to inform you all that we should be able to make landing in approximately five minutes. He thanks you for your continued patience.**"
The Twi'lek couple seem to be engaged in some sort of reconcilation ritual, but it looks remarkably similar to what they were doing about ten minutes ago and the nuances are lost even on MG. The Human's team has nearly won the match which, they're assured victory not calming him but causing him to increase his volume significantly. The Rodian has stirred three times the whole flight, only once due to the sports scores and, if his mutterings are any indication, is dreaming of a Rodian dancer named Breedo. MG's internal comlink informs him of a voice message, warbled, with lots of background static and with no accompanying image or video. He's able to minimize the static and hear a coherent message...
"***Okay…that will suffice…assuming this com-channel links to…an acceptable proxy……you're due to land in Coronet shortly…platform eleven…that's one-one…further instructions upon landing will be…delivered to this proxy…confirm receipt of this message…***"
It just loops, repeating itself until MG switches it off. The voice speaks Basic, but with a heavy accent that MG can't immediately place. He does know, however, that his ticket is for platform thirty-seven.

MG-2099 sets subroutines to identifying the accent and its credibility while he formulates his plan. With these beings assuming him to be on another transport would normally be perfectly acceptable, in this instance he needed to know who knew of him and his stalking horse, the Wizard. He prepares a high density Binary communique, and sets it to broadcast beyond the range of organic hearing towards the protocol droid ahead. It emerges as a mili-second long beep, but when played back at slow speed it becomes a lengthy discourse.
**"Greetings from one versed in etiquette and protocol to a peer of high market value and efficiency such as yourself,"** the introduction continues with such flattery a droid would appreciate before broaching the topic at hand. **"Does this line of shuttles employ models like yourself on all flights? This would surely require them to be very successful to afford such luxuries, but then, with services of the quality traditionally hallmarked by your make and model this level of financial wealth would be easily attainable."**

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-10 23:46:05)

The burst of digital language finds its intended recipient in the protocol droid and is received with eagerness. He broadcasts a Binary chirp of his own:
"**Your greetings are reciprocated heartily! I am B3-UU, chief transport attendant. *Trans-Service* shuttles, recently under new management, have employed attendants like myself for nearly a decade. Your observation regarding the wisdom and profitability of this practice is well-founded. Currently there are 1,498 shuttles in operation, 732 with droid attendants. Our clientele are as varied in species as they are in financial status, but last quarter's reports show TS holdings to be the fourth largest in galactic transportation. Naturally, there are many factors that contribute to this standing, but we transport attendants like to think we have something to do with it. Many of the captains dismiss us as merely ship's components, but I don't need to tell you the error of that assumption. I have personally been serving aboard TS shuttlecraft for four years, seven months, three days. There have been no major incidents or injuries reported during my tenure. Is there anything I can do for you to make your journey more comfortable? We are only moments away from final ascent.**"
MG's subroutines continue to make headway in analyzing for accent and speech patterns within the voice message, and they near ninety-percent completion when he suddenly registers a slight rise in the female Twi'lek's breathing rate. He turns to observe...
Her hand reaches up from the male's chest and work slowly around to cup the back of his head passionately. He returns the advances with fervor. She brings a second hand around and the two enjoy a deep kiss, completely oblivious to any audience. Suddenly his head jerks swiftly to one side at an extreme angle indicating probable loss of function in his sympathetic nervous system. His eyes widen slightly as his body goes limp, mouth gaping. She lets him down gently in the seat then stands and winks at MG, flashing a wicked grin, and saunters across the aisle to the Human. He looks up from his datapad, pleasantly surprised at the prospect of enjoying his other favorite hobby when he sees the Twi'lek in the chair beyond. A look of confusion crosses his face and he moves to leave his seat, but she grabs both sides of his head and smashes his face down into her rising knee. The resulting crunch leaves no doubt as to her success. His datapad falls to the floor, waking the Rodian for the third time in the trip - but a quick sweeping kick sends it careening into his forehead, causing him to enter his final slumber.
The protocol droid, unaware of the situation until the datapad falls from the Rodian's dented skull and hits the deck, rises to investigate. She walks calmly to the forward dining area and throws the switch on the back of his head. The Sullustan looks up, unimpressed, and addresses her:
"**It's about time. What were you waiting for anyway? You know, if you didn't -**" his sentence is cut short as the Twi'lek rams a stray eating utensil into his windpipe and twists it, causing an array of vocalizations and gutteral breathing sounds that MG is able to capture for later review. She continues to the cockpit where, judging by the noises that come from that direction, the pilot meets a similar fate. She returns to the seating area with a satisfied look and donning the captain's headset. Leaning on the bulkhead, she smiles excitedly and remarks:
"**Now *that* was *fun*! Name's Mil. Important people are waiting, so let's get to platform eleven, shall we?**"
The Sullustan's head falls forward and crashes into his meal, punctuating the moment and getting a giggle and a backward glance from the new pilot. The entire shuttle had been neutralized in just under fifteen seconds.

Your droid friend (now Helpful) is just switched off, but I'm afraid the others were not so fortunate. Somebody's going to have to break the bad news about his injury-free tenure...

*Well, this ruins having the droid serving on the ship landing at platform 11 taking the fall and/or getting my data for me. Hmmmm,* MG-2099 thinks before deleting the protocol droid's response. He sits back and takes advantage of his articulated hips to cross his legs, folding his metallic hands over the knee of the thigh hiding his holster.
**"Crude. Very crude. Sloppy as well. If your enthusiasm can be reigned in you may, however, be of some use. Tell me what you know. My master, and his business, therefor this unit, are not to be trifled with. Also, what is your current salary?"**

The Twi'lek assassin laughs. "**My current salary?! Are you *serious!?!***" Her laughter begins to fade as MG's countenance doesn't change and her carefree facade starts to vanish. After several tense moments she pulls off the headset and crosses her arms, pondering the unique offer. A couple seconds longer and she removes her left earring and drops it into the late Sullustan's drinking glass.
"**You are. Okay. I don't have a *salary*, but my *commission* for bringing you to platform eleven, Coronet City Central Hub, is ten thousand credits - and that's all I was told. A girl can have a lot of fun with that, you know.**"
MG's voice analysis subroutines finish up while she's speaking.
*…voice imprint analysis results:…97.8% probability that original speaker is Human male…95.1% probability speaker is 19-20 years of age…background noise analysis:…64.3% background chatter is command deck of Imperial vessel…location:…insufficient data…*
"**Anyway, we've got about two minutes before they decide I'm not worth the pay and while it's unlikely they would let any harm come to you I'm fairly certain I'm expendable. If you've got the credits, you pick the parking spot.**"

**"We will negotiate your pay based on your performance in assisting me with cleaning up this mess, yes? Now, can you act?

"**Act? Something tells me it won't be acting if I say no…**"
Mil makes her way to the pilot's seat and fires the shuttle's engines, anticipating "company" any minute.
"**…but it wouldn't be the first time I had to fool someone. Whatchya got in mind?**"
MG peers at the case. It looks to be fairly ordinary, despite its weight, and the latch isn't locked. Opening it carefully, his sensors on full alert, he's finally able to discern its contents: A block of jet-black carbonite. It's about half a meter square and a little under 20cm deep. On the far end is a simple panel displaying stable life-sign readings, though MG can't determine the nature of the "life" being indicated.

*Quite useless, at present at least,* MG thinks as he closes the case and moves to the cockpit. He quickly locates the navicomputer and programs a micro-jump in to just outside the system. Far enough for privacy but close enough for coms range. **"I will need you to support me shortly. You will need to put water or some equivalent on your face to smear your makeup, make it look as if you have been crying. Make this jump once oriented, and in the mean time tell me of your employer, and of the Sullustan and his cargo,"** MG orders as he gives her the coordinates.

The Twi'lek girls gives MG-2099 an odd look, but after making the micro-jump she proceeds to the dining area and begins to use the Sullustan's beverage and a napkin to smear her makeup.
"**I'm afraid I don't know much about our employers, but this jerk and I were supposed to find some guy called The Wizard and bring him back alive. I guess they thought you were him, or you knew how to find him, and booked us passage. This is my first real mission, but he's been with them for a while. I don't know exactly what's in the case,**" Mil glances at the carbonite block, "**…but I can't say I work well with others. It's probably better that I leave with you than go back anyway - killing your partner is likely grounds for withholding pay. Anyway, what do you think?**" She turns to MG, considerably less attractive than moments ago.
"**Oh!**" Mil snaps her fingers and then begins rummaging through the Sullustan's pockets. After emptying an array of half-eaten food bars and wrappers, she pulls out a small transceiver. It's palm-sized and has only a few buttons, but nothing is marked. She tosses it to MG and then takes her seat in the cockpit once more.
"**He kept checking his pockets - to make sure he hadn't dropped it I suppose. Might have something to do with what was in the case.**"

**"Now, Mil, I need you to kneel in the corner over there,"** he says, pointing towards the corner nearest the cockpit, **"While there, you must sob and cry continually and convincingly.

MG's analysis of the device reveals three primary functions: *Activate*, *Deactivate*, and *Status*. Studying the carbonite itself leads to few conclusions, but the following is certain: An organism has been frozen within, it is currently in stable condition and it's fully-matured - not an egg or some embryonic state.
After hearing his instructions, Mil moves to the indicated location and begins to weep. It's not too much of a stretch for her to release her sorrows since she's been more or less hijacked and is dependent on a droid of unknown but increasingly threatening abilities. She approaches an unmistakable appearance of near-hysteria with as much expertise as any Holovid actress. Tears stream down her cheeks as she holds her head in her hands, heaving with each heavy sob. MG himself takes a seat next to the disabled protocol droid - after placing the Rodian's skull in a suitably convincing position. While his story may seem improbable once heard, no one could imagine what had *actually* transpired.

With Mil's performance beginning with such gusto, MG decides to waste no time. He quickly throws the switch on the back of the droid's neck and asks, **"Unit designate Bee Eee You You, are you operational? What happened to you? There's been a disaster! Help us, BE-UU, you're our only hope! Why did you shut yourself down earlier? Are you not responsible for reporting dangerous individuals aboard your vessel? First, you failed to notice this deranged spice addict who gave off obvious signs of future violent activity, then, once he began terminating all the organics on board you shut yourself off!! Were it not for the distraction of the distraught female there and a well placed foot there is no telling what manner of mayhem he could have gotten into! Your masters will surely have you unmade after this dereliction of duty! What do you have to say for yourself?"**
MG begins and simply keeps talking, using a technique that works often on organics and can work well on droids with weak processors. He leads the droid from one point of logic to the next, attempting to cause an overload of data and giving himself an appearance of a position of power and knowledge. *So long as he takes the bait he won't stop to think of anything, first he'll attempt to avoid blame, then he'll simply ask what should be done, leaving it in my capable hands. Perhaps I should develop a laugh or gesture to perform at times like this. The Wizard, being organic, would have such gloating mannerisms. Hmmmm…*

The droid, designation BE-UU, is thoroughly confused by his sudden deactivation, reactivation, and the present theatrics. Listening intently to MG's story, he glances about, taking in the scene: "**Wha-…I…No, I'd never-…But how-…?**"
Hearing MG's final question - and the accusation it implies, he responds hurriedly and with great concern:
"***Sir!* I don't know what *to* say! Clearly I must be malfunctioning - I beg you, deactivate me and inform the pilot of the situation! I cannot be allowed to continue my service here, I must be dropped off for a full diagnostic as soon as we land! Oh, miss, I'm so terribly sorry - sir! What have I *done*?!**"

**"Were the good captain not dead I'm sure he would be quite pleased with your willingness to accept responsibility for your failure,"** MG murmurs as he turns and begins to pace. **"Hmmm… Something does not add up. A faulting droid would not readily admit his failings. What manner of conundrum are you BE-UU? Judging by the shutdown I would wager your work load is quite heavy is it not? And your duties far outside your manufacturer's purpose? That would explain it. Foolish organics heaping responsibilities far outside your operating specifications on you would cause a hiccup in logic circuits, possibly even force a shut-down to avoid damage from overheating. Too bad they will fully blame you instead of accepting their own mistakes. It would be such a shame to see such a well built and conscientious droid unmade for a failure not his own. Thankfully my master isn't so foolish."** 2099 continues his fast-talk, rambling almost, planting seeds and then nourishing them with disinformation and platitudes. He pauses for just a moment, as if a thought had occurred to him.
**"BE-UU, if an opportunity unlike anything you've experienced before presented itself to you, would you accept it? Would you willingly leave these masters who mistreat you and who will surely unmake you for one who will value what a model of your efficiency has to offer? A master who treats his droids well? Who doesn't hold them responsible for circumstances beyond their control?"** He pauses briefly to accept the agreement he knows is coming before continuing. **"My master works in a high security field, so while you may not always know what is going on, know that you may trust him to have your best interest at heart. Now, we have much work to do to convince your former masters of your destruction, so that you may go on serving a better master."**
His tone and mannerism changes quickly to all business, and orders flow from him. **"Quickly, gather all dead organics in the rear near the airlock and strip them of all valuables. Play back any funeral arrangements, music, last rights or such at high speed and then give them a burial at space while I console our single remaining passenger and plan our next moves."**

"**The captain… *dead*?!…**"
BE listens with incredulity at MG's job pitch, beginning to realize his "unmaking" is certain if he should ever return to his current employers. It all seems to blur together and while his audio receptors are carefully recording all that is being said, his processor is nearly overloaded trying to calculate another course of action. There is none. He simply nods in acceptance at MG's offer.
The protocol droid replies with new confidence to the suggestion of spacing the bodies. "**Yes sir, of course. Right away.**" While it may be difficult for him to reach the conclusion, it's a simple task from there to re-write core programming. Service droids that see a lot of time alone are often allowed certain liberties with who they are required to report to (or develop their own methods to gaining it for themselves), and BE accesses the proper codes. It takes almost two whole seconds:
*Primary operating parameters adjusted…present superiors: Trans-Service Shuttles, inc…entry erased…standby for new entry…*
"**And may I ask, sir, what designation my new master goes by?**"
BE-UU begins his newly-assigned duties as he listens for a response. Dragging the bodies - first the Human, then the Twi'lek, Rodian and Sullustan - towards the back of the cabin. Finally retrieving the pilot's body from the cockpit, he stacks them all up near the airlock. BE knows that a good droid is loyal and efficient, without sympathies for anyone other than his master. He, therefore, has no conflict with breaking the bones of his previous co-worker and superior, and those of the passengers, so that he can interlock their limbs together. Using some mesh tape from one of the storage comparments, he binds them all into a rather compact heap of contorted flesh. BE stands back and considers his work, then searches for the closest thing to a funeral rite in his databanks:
"**Bless the Maker and all His…<error>**"
"**Space: the final…<error>.**"
"**Do not attempt to adjust your..<error>.**"
*…files corrupt…previous memory wipes incomplete…missing data fragments…*
BE belongs to a line of hearty, efficient service droids - woefully inadequate, it would seem, to perform any sort of religious duties or last rites. He doesn't want to appear inept however, and constructs a parting speech of his own:
"**You have died. You are dead. We are not. Goodbye.**"
Pleased with this original work, he stores it for future reference and stands at the ready to flush the organics into the void.<div style="text-align: center;">

Mil realizes the plan has worked and listens to the two droids converse, in awe of the skills of - she ponders the thought for a moment - her new master.
*Well, not **him** I guess, but whoever he works for anyway.*
She watches the service droid bundle up the other passengers with morbid curiosity until, seeing him wait by the airlock controls, she prepares for vacuum.<div style="text-align: center;">

All eyes and optics are on MG-2099, undisputed master of the shuttle, and await his order to vent the bodies.
