Dawn spills across the deserts of Tatooine to find a lone assassin droid assessing his options. The wreckage of several swoop bikes, and their pilots, litter the surrounding dunes. He appears to be the only one awake... or maybe just still alive. The immensely powerful ion burst that caused the mayhem the night before managed to crystallize some of the sand beneath his feet; it crunches and breaks with every step as he searches for his one comrade: a fellow droid known as Captain Steel.
It's not a difficult task with his superior sensors, and the heat differentiation on the warming ground makes finding Steel relatively easy. Unfortunately, he's in several, very damaged, pieces. His head and most of his chest, and his one remaining arm, seem to have survived the initial attack but the residual ion charges in the surrounding debris can act like poison to an unprotected droid. A quick check verifies that he's beyond repair. His hand clenches a small datacard, which Surge is able to scan. Steel's vocabulator reflects his failing condition, but the message is clear:
*Well Sonny, looks like this is the b-b-big one! Not saying I'm h-h-happy about it but it sure is overdue. I've been around l-l-longer than most of us and it figures it'd take some wild n-n-night to do me in… Anyway… The S-s-sun's yours if you want it. These are the c-c-codes that'll get ya off the ground. The crew m-m-may not like it at first, but they'll respect m-m-my final orders. Take care of them for me…Steel out…*
Surge's calculates it will take at least a day to reach Arriaddik's place, where the Steel Sun is currently. That's on foot and assuming his attempt at leveling Jabba's palace wasn't traced back there.

Why don't we solo for a bit just to get into the groove. Once you get into town we'll open up the CC, fair enough? The title sort of assumes you're still up for the contract on Wraith in Kessel, but feel free to pursue that or not. Make sure you stat up to CL8 too (let me know the additions and any changes you want to make to Feats or Talents or whatever).

*Well, at least he got to go out with a bang…*
Taking a final look at the remains of his - though very brief - friend, Surge considers bringing them with him, but then decides to let the captain join the other myriads of secrets buried beneath Tatooine´s sands. Securing the datacard inside his storage compartment he sits down for a moment to think about what to do next. He was surprised that the captain had offered him his ship, and he did share the old droids assessment that the crew might not be too happy about that, especially since he had been kind of responsible for Steels death. Also, he wasn´t sure it was in his own best interests to keep the ship either. The captain may have been a nice guy, but he had been involved in some shady business, and given the accident in transit to Tatooine, at least someone wanted him dead, and the ship may well attract unwanted attention.
Still, he decided, the ship was an asset and he would use it for the purpose he had originally intended, to ship him to - and hopefully off - Kessel, but after that he´d let the crew take her and be on their way. Satisfied with his decision for the moment, he takes a minute to see if any of the swoop wreckages around him are salvageable. It would drastically increase his travel rate, and he would like that very much. He felt like he´d had enough of this desert planet to last him a lifetime.

Scanning his surroundings, Surge is able to find and repair what passes for most of a swoop bike - the important parts anyway. It's takes only a few hours to assemble and travel to the outskirts of Mos Eisley and close enough to have a view of Arriaddik's compound. It's just before noon and the twin suns' glare on the hull of the *Steel Sun* can clearly be seen from his position.

No Mechanics roll, it wasn't that bad I guess. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

Finally reaching back towards civilization, the droid assassin watched the settlement of Mos Eisley from a distance. It wouldn´t be long now, before he was off this desert planet. Carefully, he brought his swoop into the compound of the Wookie, and went looking for its furry host. They had a deal after all, and he wouldn´t leave before he had made good on that.

Surge's enhanced sensor suite makes it clear that Arriaddik - and indeed pretty much everyone else - has left. It's not exactly an ambush, as far as he can tell, it's more like the whole place has been deserted. The *Steel Sun* is still on the pad and the droid crew seems present and intact and, considering their processing power, have no idea what has happened.
Ahead lies the main corridor that would lead further in to the rest of the compound by way of the hidden weapons store. It wouldn't be much trouble for Surge to simply bypass that route and use the exterior access doors to the landing pad on his right, leading directly to his ship.

I know we talked about your sensors before, I'm just assuming Surge is cautious enough to be alert in any of these situations. Capable of seeing in the infrared spectrum up to 2km (which presumably means he's able to identify basic droid and other electronic components) and X-ray vision for 100m - I think that's what we had said in the beginning. It'll be more important on Kessel. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)
