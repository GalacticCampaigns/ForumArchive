# [The Unsung] Chapter 1: Shadows of Coruscant

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-01 22:19:51)

*It has been around two-hundred years since the Battle of Ruusan. During that time, the Jedi have begun recovering from the devastation of the war against the Brotherhood of Darkness. However, they have not been doing it alone. During these times, the Jedi have had help from the Republic, with whom they have officially joined. Working together, the Jedi and the Republic have become an awesome force for good in the galaxy.
However, that does not mean that there are no disputes. Border skirmishes, pirates, and the occasional separatist group, have all caused various problems of differing difficulty for the recovering Republic. However, the Jedi have been there each time to help out. Some of the long-lived Jedi who still remember the wars against the Sith claim that the Jedi are slowly growing soft and complacent. They say that, while great good is being served by being joined with the Republic, the Order lost much when it lost its independence. These arguments, however, are for the masters to decide. Padawans have other chores to do.
Traders have made a great deal of money during this time of reconstruction. With the Republic and the Jedi busy cleaning up and restructuring, they have left the Outer Rim Territories for the most part alone, opening up avenues for money for anyone clever enough or strong enough to take it.*
It is also a time of confusion on Coruscant. Supreme Chancellor Fyor Salm faces accusations of corruption, weakening his control over the Galactic Senate. Meanwhile, the terrorist group known as The Maw has declared war on the Senate itself, creating chaos on the once-peaceful world at the center of the galaxy. Though the Supreme Chancellor has mad eradicating the last vestiges of The Maw Group his primary concern, it has only made him a target for their attacks. Frustrated with The Maw's hit-and-run tactics, Salm has called upon aid from other quarters in the Republic.
Each of you received a summons requesting your presence on Coruscant. Supreme Chancellor Salm has asked that you meet with him to discuss The Maw Group, and what to do about it. The summons said that he would make it worth the trip to the capital planet. You've all come to the summons, though maybe not for the same reasons. Some might come in search of money. Some might come in search of political favor. Others want glory. Finally, some may have come out of a sense of responsibility. In any case, you are all now disembarking from your various transports at the plaza in front of the Chancellor's office.
At customs, you were all told that weapons are **strictly** forbidden on the capital planet. The only exceptions are Jedi and their lightsabers, member of the Coruscant Security Forces, and ambassadorial staff; all of whom were issued permits to carry such weapons. You were told this several times while getting off your transports, though you were not searched.
Now, standing outside the plaza to the Chancellor's office, you realize that you've arrived a few minutes early for your meeting with the galactic leader. The plaza outside his office, high above the surface of the city world, is packed with beings. Some are workers erecting grandstands for the Chancellor's speech tomorrow. The plaza is a large open area surrounded by a colonnade. A massive building is on one side; a series of columns hold up a marble lintel bordering the other three sides.
Most of the beings are standing in a long line, waiting to be allowed into the tower. The line winds around the work crews and the repulsorlift grandstands, ending at the middle of the north edge of the plaza (which is itself a large balcony of the tower).
You've only been here a couple of minutes when an exasperated groan ripples through the crowd. "A four-hour wait? This is ridiculous!"
It looks like you'll be late for your meeting.

Sor Larn doesn't even hesitate, instead walking straight for the door, pushing his way easily through the crowd. He reaches the door, and addresses the nearest guard or other senatorial employee. "I'm here for a meeting with the Supreme Chancellor." He shows his summons to the guard/employee, and waits for the response.

Danyeal sighs quite loudly as the rest of the crowd.
~Oh I did not come all the way back here just to be late, besides not my style to wait anyways....lets see if I can have a little fun and be productive too.~
Danyeal heads out of the line towards a group of some of the workers with a grin, he respected people like them they worked hard to survive but knew how to have fun too.
Danyeal walks up to the ones running one of the repulsorlifts hoping maybe he had met them before but even if not, he was willing to share some credits to get out of the waiting.
"Hey guys the names Danyeal and I seriously need some help and maybe a few moments of your time..."
Danyeal points up to one of the other Balcony Ledges (occ: Window if need be) heading into the Tower, remembering from his visits that would get him around that rather "Long" line.
"..If you guys could get me up to that Balcony you would be doing me a HUGE favor plus I would be willing to pay for a couple of rounds later at the Cantina, what do you think? Can you Help a Guy out?"
Danyeal smiles as he shows a hand of 200 Credits, more then enough for a few rounds.

Ubese by nature aren't seen as an intimidating species, mostly because of their slight frame compared to humans. However this particular Ubese was in stuncuffs, and being escorted into the antechamber by a pair of Coursant Guards, in they're dark blue livery. One of them carried two rifles.
It was a well known fact that the Ubese blamed the Republic for the destruction of they're planet, and while the exact details are obsure, whats clear is the Republic preformed a preemptive strike against them, detonating the weapons of mass destruction and rendering all but one planet in the system uninhabitable. And the inhabitable planet was still a toxic wasteland. And the Ubese despise the Jedi for not preventing it.
This particular Ubese was Sazaks. Even by the standards of her people, she is overzealous in her hatred of the Jedi. Arrested for the deaths of three members of the Jedi Agricultural corps its unclear what the Supreme Chancellor saw in this murderer, but one thing was sure. If it wasn't for the stuncuffs, she was likely to attack anyone she suspected of Force Sensitivity.
Unlike the others, Sazaks and her escorts would properly wait until the important man was ready to see them.

Cole takes a deep breath as his gaze travels over the plaza.... *Ahh Coruscant…* A smile creases the corner of his mouth at the thought of being back... *How many years has it been since I visited this planet?*  He tried to remember and raised his brow at the realization of how long it had been. "That long?" He muttered under his breath. His green eyes then finally setting themselves on the line as he smirked inwardly... "Great", he said with a sarcastic tone.
*Well, let see how much weight this summons carries when I show it to a guard.* With that thought he began to survey the area for any guards, pausing for a moment as he noticed a man (Danyeal) speaking with some workers, then continuing on as he looks to the entrances for guards who might allow him to enter.

Zeyn was sitting on a low wall at the plaza, awaiting to be let inside. Even sitting down, the Feeorin stood nearly as high as most other beings there, and with his muscular mass he was an impressive sight. Although the scars might be intimidating to some people, he was really a nice guy. Those scars were just the result of 200 years of serving in harsh environments. He had really enjoyed being away from this type of job ever since he decided to retire, but some of his old contacts in the Republic military had convinced him that his services where needed, and so here he were.

Jedi-status was not something to be flaunted, not the way *they* taught it anyway, but if it got the job done, in our protagonist's opinion, then it was definitely there to do the job. The thought of waiting for four hours to meet the Chancellor, a sentient who garnered as much of his respect as the Masters of the Order, had not even crossed his mind. He was most definitely not going to be late.
Sifting through the crowd, and slowly making his way to the front of the line, he dug his way to however was in charge. Speaking loudly enough for everyone in earshot to hear, he announced, "**Official Jedi business, step aside. Haden Krogra to see the Supreme Chancellor.**"
The look on his face was convincingly grim, the art of the persuasion was all about charisma, and details - details, details, details.

As Haden, Cole, and Sor walk up and each present their credentials, a scruffy looking man in uniform waves the group down. Haden recognizes the rank on the man's left breast as sergeant. He looks each of you dead in the eye as he speaks.

> I don&#39;t care who you **think** you are or who you&#39;ve been *summoned* to visit! I&#39;ve got my orders. **No one** gets through these doors until they&#39;ve been checked. Now get back in line and wait your turn!

He punctuates his statement by pointing his finger towards the back of the line.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Sazaks is being escorted across the plaza, she notices that the guards are taking her straight towards the building containing the Chancellor's office. As the trio approach the crowded doors, one of the guards speaks up over the din of the crowd to a scruffy looking person arguing with three humans.
> **Coruscant Guard 1 wrote:**
>
> Sergeant Munten. We have our orders to escort the prisoner inside. As you can see here&#8230;

The guard finishes by activating the holoprojector in his gauntlet, showing Munten his orders and seal.
Sergeant Munten quickly glances over the orders before answering.
> **Sergeant Munten wrote:**
>
> No problem, private. Just give me a minute to let the senatorial guards know you&#39;re coming.

Munten then turns to the side, raising his hand to his ear.

When the workers notice Danyeal, one of the dozen or so of them smiles and walks over towards him.

> I&#39;d gladly take your money, but you ain&#39;t getting up on these grandstands. See, we here got work to do. So, why don&#39;t you take your dandy little clothes and go play with the other girls.

The worker finishes by laughing quite loudly in your face before brushing past Danyeal, making a special effort to bump him in the shoulder. As he does, Danyeal feels something inside the man's work clothes, pressed close to the worker's chest. Something small and hard. Danyeal realizes that the worker is carrying a hold-out pistol.

Sor notes that the man isn't paying attention to him and steps behind one of the other two nearby. Using them as cover between him and the guard, he attempts to slip in through the door unnoticed.

Lyle slips through the crowd to try and catch up with his jedi associate Haden. Seeing that the guard is being unruly, Lyle gives a nod at haden. (Lyle to Haden) "Lets see if we can make this seem as important to are guard friend, as it is to us."

Sazaks remains passive, as the guards clear her passage to see the Supreme Chancellor, what did she care of the Republic and its petty squabbles. However when Lyle mentioned Jedi on Jedi business, the Ubese's attention is immediately drawn to to the Jedi.
Her first impulse was to run towards him, swinging with fist and foot until either the Jedi was bleeding on the ground, or the guards shot her in the back. The idea that the Jedi might defeat her was inconceivable to the Ubese Jedi Killer.
*Patience, Patience.* Sazaks tried to calm herself. If she got herself killed on a suicide charge, it would be so much harder to kill more Jedi.

Danyeal quickly realizes that the "worker" was not who should be around here, but more importantly that the "worker" meant to cause harm more then likely.
Danyeal pockets his credits back walk back over to the man that bumped him, and taps him on the shoulder till he turns around and faces Danyeal sighs as he gives the man a "story"
"Well then I suppose I should at least catch your name, after all I want to be sure to let the man who sent me here to know who it was that didn't assist me with the particular goal "we" had in mind by getting me inside the building quickly...."
Danyeal gestures with his hand as if he could care less about it
"..but then I guess once "he" finds out, not helping me will be the least of your problems."
Danyeal begins to turn to leave (knowing by now the man had an interest in him to stay or to help him now Danyeal does so slowly)
"Don't worry I'll make sure to drink a mournful toast to you..."

He gave a nod of respect to the sergeant as he glanced over to the line then to the Kel Dor before turning to make his way over to one of the walls at the plaza. Hearing the guard mention something about the prisoner and their orders , Cole glanced briefly at the Ubese as he passed.
*There is my lesson in humility for the day.* He thought to himself as he leaned against one of the walls. *What was I thinking? Of course, there would be a line. They're more alert because of the speech that the Chancellor is giving tomorrow. Still, something doesn't add up. They must have told me dozens of times when I was in customs about the weapon restrictions. Yet, they never once asked me for my blasters. Its not like you can't see two hip holsters hanging from my waist. If I could get through customs wearing my blasters at my side for all to see then anyone could sneak something past, he thought.* Its was then that a bad feeling came over him. His gut told him something was wrong as he scanned the crowd for a moment. "No," he muttered under his breath as he pushed the thought out of his mind.
*You're acting paroniod Cole, there is nothing wrong. The guards have everything under control. That is why they have a line to make sure everything is secure. Still there is no harm in just watching from here to make sure everythings alright.* Cole, propped his foot against the wall as he let himself relax for a moment then began to watch the crowd.

Hiding behind the others, the stealthy Kel Dor successfully snuck around Munten and into the corridor leading into the Chancellorâ€™s office. Looking down the hall is clear sailing to the turbo lift.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sergeant Munten looks at the human Jedi for a second, his eyes glazing over. However, after a few seconds, he shakes his head to the side as though he were clearing cobwebs. Looking Lyle up and down, paying particular attention to the lightsaber, Munten says,
> **Sergeant Munten wrote:**
>
> So, you think that just because youâ€™re a Jedi, Iâ€™m going to let you in here? What, next thing youâ€™re going to try a *mind trick* on me to make me disobey my orders? Listen, *boy*, get back in line with the rest of the people. And take your friend with you.

Munten finishes by pointing at Haden
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Danyeal walks away from the worker he bumped into, the worker reaches out and grabs Danyeal by the arm, stopping him from leaving.
> **Worker 1 wrote:**
>
> Wait. Wait. Iâ€™m sorry for being rude, sir. But, yaâ€™ gotta understand my position here. We canâ€™t let all youse normal folks up on these here grandstands till theyâ€™s finished. Itâ€™s kinda dangerous. Donâ€™t go tellinâ€™ nobody â€˜bout what I said. Please sir, I got a family to feed.

Danyeal notices that as the manâ€™s talking about family (an obvious lie from Danyealâ€™s point of view), his eyes are darting around the plaza, looking at all the guards. He also seems to be feeling with his free hand near the buttons on his shirt.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the crowd continues to move around, there is a part in the crowd at a particular moment.and Lyle, Haden, Cole, Danyeal, and Sazaks all suddenly have a very clear view of the repulsorlift platform that the Chancellor will be giving his speech from tomorrow. The adornments give it away. You also notice a human working near an open panel on the platform pulling objects from his pockets and stuffing them inside the platform before shutting the panel again. The human looks around quickly and notices the beings looking at him. He quickly pulls his hat further down his face before jumping from the platform and mingling with the crowd.
Cole recognizes the manâ€™s evasion tactics are meant to get him lost in the crowd.
Sazaks notices that the objects put in the platform were connected by wires. She also notices that as the man move into the crowd, he waves his hand at some of the workers around the grandstands. They signal him back.
Sor was too far into the building to see anything.
Zeyn couldnâ€™t see through the crowd.
(Sor and Zeyn canâ€™t act on this information yet)

Danyeal shows a look of "understanding", as he does understand that the man is lying through his teeth but will let it for the moment as he is reaching around his shirt whiich was more of a concern as the man did have a weapon on him.
"Oh but of course I understand my friend, if it is dangerous being around the Grand Stands then you are quite right..."
Danyeal puts grabs the mans arm with the arm that is being held, as showing a sign of understanding and friendliness then leans in and whispers so not to let the guards hear.
"......but for your sake and mine I hope your not reaching for your blaster or we both will be killed by the guards, so if you can't get me up the Grand Stand then you best get me into a Service Entrance so I can get around that damn line so I can get into the Chancellors Office, otherwise we both will be "removed" from our jobs, do you understand me now or shall I draw the Guards attention to us both..."
Danyeal leans back out with a smile showing no sign of there being a threat but just a friendly mistake.
"....I was suppose to be meeting with your Supervisor I just assumed he was near the Grand Stand, perhaps you could show me to him so I could be on my way then?"
Danyeal starts to wonder who is playing who here....if the man was an assassin he sure wasn't a bright one, if he wasn't then who the hell is he...and why is he so serious...

Jace walks into the plaza. Looking around he can't belive that the leader of the galaxy wanted to meet with him for something or the other, maybe he needed someone to play a couple of hands of sabacc with. *"I can't belive this. I am waiting for the guards to come out of no where to arrest me. I will have to admit I didn't see this comming."*
He looks around for the exits. A good escape route was allways a good idea in any situation. He walks up to someone who looks like they might be able to help him with getting into see the chanselor. "Excuss me I belive I have an opiontment with the Chanselor. Could you please direct me to his office please." Jace hopes that the hold- out he kept hidden on himself would stay that way.
((OCC: He took 10 on hiding the hold out before he left to get here. He has a +2 to that he will take longer if he needs to. Preseption +6 what do I see.))

"Speaking of noticing, what that man doing by the platform?â€ He said to himself as he stepped away from the wall and began moving quickly in his direction. *What was he putting in there* , he wondered as he began searching for the man in the crowd.

Looking back towards some of the other workers, he motions them with his head.

Danyeal notices several of the workers leave their posts and head towards him. He notices that each of the men that are headed towards him also have bulges under their clothes. Just like the worker thatâ€™s still holding Danyealâ€™s arm.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Jace**</span>
Jace notices that the plaza in front of the Chancellorâ€™s office is several hundred meters above the normal â€˜street levelâ€™ of Coruscant. On two sides are the drop offs, though most people stay away from them no problem. The side that Jace came in on has several skywalks leading to other buildings. The side to Jaceâ€™s left (south) is the building of the Chancellorâ€™s office anyway.
As Jace approaches the guards at the doors, he notices that the guard isnâ€™t looking at him or anyone in front of him. The guardâ€™s looking at two men in brown robes running towards the west side of the plaza where a few unpowered repulsorlift platforms are located.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Sazaks**</span>
The guards, seeing the Jedi running towards the platforms donâ€™t have their eyes on Sazaks and thus didnâ€™t hear her comment.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Lyle**</span>
Reaching out through the Force, Lyle is able to sense the thick crowds in the plaza. However, the man that Lyle is searching for canâ€™t hide in it from him. Lyle senses a person moving with purpose away from the platforms and towards the western end of the plaza.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Hayden**</span>
The wind whips through Haydenâ€™s hair as he races through the plaza at a speed no normal being could match. As heâ€™s half-way across the plaza, the man sees Hayden and begins to run. As he runs, Hayden notices that he reaches into his pockets and pulls out a hold-out pistol and starts firing into the crowd at Hayden, but also not caring whether he hits anyone else in the process. Hayden takes a hit in the shoulder. A graze, but a hit none the less.
(Hayden takes 8 points damage)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Cole**</span>
Cole loses sight of the man as he disappears into the crowd. However, he does notice the two Jedi running towards that section of the plaza, one of them at a supernatural speed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Everyone**</span>
As the blaster bolt rings out, the crowd begins screaming and panicking, everyone going every which way. Cole and Zeyn both see the crowd panicking and hear the blaster bolts coming from the western edge of the plaza. Sor also hears the noise while in the corridor. Looking back, he notices that the guard has left his post, heading towards the western edge of the plaza. Both of Sazaksâ€™s guards lift up their rifles and start backing Sazaks towards the Chancellorâ€™s building. Danyeal sees the man holding him finish drawing his hold out blaster, keeping his other hand on Danyeal. He waves the pistol in the air, firing off one shot.
> **Worker 1 wrote:**

> **Down with the Republic! Down with tyranny! Down with corruption! And the Maw will make it happen today!**

One of the other workers that Danyeal can see pulls out a hold-out from his tunic and fires a shot towards the Chancellor building. The shot almost hits Sazaks in the face, but instead hits one of her guards in the gut, causing him to double over onto the ground. As he falls down, the key card to Sazaksâ€™s cuffs falls out too.

At least I won't have to worry about the guards trying to arrest me on this one." He also looks to see if there might be any places for good cover. Moving to the cover when he finds it. *"I could have been in cantiana pllaying a feew hands of sabacc, cold drink in my hand and hot Twi-lek dancing girl o my lap. But no I had to come here."* He thinks to himself.

One of the workers sees Lyle heading straight towards their group, raises his pistol and lets lose a volley of burning light. The shot goes wild and almost hits a young female Mon Calamari. The younglingâ€™s mother grabs her child up and hurries for shelter, not quiet sure where to go. Itâ€™s obvious that these men donâ€™t care about bystanders!
The worker who had hidden something in the platform continues on his path towards the western edge of the plaza. Heâ€™ll be there in a few seconds. Looking over his back and seeing the now lit lightsaber, his eyes go wide and he fires another shot. The shot goes straight and true towards Haydenâ€™s chest, but the blue blade deftly knocks it upward instead, where it disappears into the sky.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cole still has the worker in his sights.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another worker takes up where his companion failed and fires a round at Lyle. This time, the shot hits true. Lyle takes the shot in the arm. (11 points damage)
Several of the other workers start firing at the guards positioned at the entrance to the Chancellorâ€™s building. Most of them take hits, including Sazaks second guard, who takes a shot to the head, killing him instantly.
The worker who has his hands on Danyeal looks at him and says,
> **Worker 1 wrote:**
>
> Donâ€™t make any trouble and youâ€™ll get out of this alive. Understand, *boy*?

Hayden finally catches up with the worker heâ€™s been chasing. The worker and Hayden are both 10 meters from the western edge of the plaza.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lyle has obviously seen that the workers are all intent on nothing good. Through the Force, Lyle has discovered that there are a dozen workers with guns drawn, all of them intent on killing guards. They donâ€™t care either if they hit a few bystanders in the process.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zeyn now sees clearly that the blaster bolts are coming from the grandstands. The workers have all drawn pistols and are firing into the crowd and at the guards.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sor gets outside the chancellorâ€™s building and lines up a beautiful stun shot on the worker holding Danyeal. Blue energy crackles over his body and he staggers back, releasing Danyeal, but doesnâ€™t fall.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jace finds cover on the opposite side of a grandstand from Danyeal and his now disabled abductor. He is only able to see a few of the workers. Only the ones who arenâ€™t on the other side of the grandstands from himself.

Sor grunts in grim satisfaction as his shot hits true. He takes a moment to line up a second shot, careful to avoid hitting any nearby bystanders. As he does, he calls out to the man the worker had a hold of, "You might want to step back." Giving Danyeal another moment to move, Sor then fires his shot at the same target, hoping to drop him this time.

The female Ubese watches as both of her guards die in a hail of blaster fire. With a level of grace few humans could manage. Sazaks takes up the card to release her stuncuffs. With her hands free, she snatches up her Commando blaster rifle from the dead guards.
Not wasting time to search them for anything useful, she takes up one of their rifles, and makes a run for it. She wasn't going to waste this opportunity for freedom waiting around for more guards to put her cuffs back on. And the Chancellor could kiss a Wookie for all she cared, so she turned towards the nearest Skywalk and ran. Hopefully security in the nearby building wouldn't be alerted yet, and it will be easy for her to slip into the seedy lower levels of Courasant.

Hearing the sound of blaster fire Coleâ€™s instincts and years of combat training took control as he drew both his blasters, and raced towards the panicking crowd.

He scanned the area as he moved in and took aim at the closest target that was a threat.

Flinching at the pain from the blaster bolt, Lyle knows these guys are serious. Not just from the shot, but from the innocent bystanders that might get injured or killed.
Without a momentâ€™s hesitation Lyle knows that the men with the blasters must go or civilians will get hurt.
Drawing his lightsaber and igniting his blue blade from his hip is like breathing for Lyle, and subduing these evil men is just what Lyle thrives for, especially when people are bent on using violence to help them gain power.

As Sazaks heads towards the eastern skywalks leading to another building, she is not alone. Most of the crowd of beings that had been in the plaza is also heading towards the skywalks, but Sazaks is in the lead. Sheâ€™ll get to them first.
However, as Sazaks is running, she hears a wailing ahead and towards the side. Noticing the source of the noise in her peripheral vision, Sazaks sees a toddler Twiâ€™lek, no more than three years old crying over the corpse of an adult male Twiâ€™lek and screaming something in what Sazaks can only guess is Ryl. One of the stray blaster bolts ended the adultâ€™s life. The pressing crowd **will** trample the youngling to death.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The worker who had previously shot at Lyle again takes a shot, but misses completely. Lyle overhears him cursing vividly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The worker who started the whole incident by hiding something in the platforms arrives at the edge of the plaza. By this point the western edge of the plaza is empty except for the worker and Hayden. The worker looks over his shoulder at Hayden, and then again over the edge of the plaza. He bends his legs as if to jump.
He doesnâ€™t get the chance, however, as Hayden arrives directly behind the worker and slashes with his lightsaber, the blade slashing across the workerâ€™s back. Hayden can smell the flesh burning as the man screams in pain and his arms fly out in both directions. The man stumbles forward before falling from the plaza into the emptiness of open air, thousands of meters above street level. (OOC: Didn't know what action you wanted from your various stats, so I just had you attack. If you want something different, make sure to specify.)
As the worker disappears from view, however, you hear the whine of repulsorlift engines. An air shuttle with an open back lifts into view of the plaza. There is a driver inside the cockpit, and the worker is laying prone in the back. The air shuttle will lift above the plaza in a few seconds. There is enough room in the shuttle for all of the blaster toting workers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Cole raced through the thinning crowd, his blaster rang out and hit true. He hit a worker straight in the shoulder. The worker cursed loudly and turned his own hold-out on Cole. His shot, however, went wild. Fortuanately, the crowd was thin enough to where no bystanders were hit.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two of the workers, upon hearing their comrade scream in pain, turn their blasters on Hayden. Hayden, though, feels a tug in the Force. Spinning around with a blur of blue light, Hayden deftly parries the bolts to the side with perfect precision.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The worker that Sor shot and the two next to him take beads on the Kel Dor. Sor seems to hear something about a â€˜masked freakâ€™. Danyeal also hears some interesting epitats about Kel Dor that really donâ€™t need to be repeated in polite company. The three bolts fly out, almost simutaneously. The first bolt hits Sor in the shoulder (dealing 8 points damage). The second bolt also hits (dealing 6 points damage). The third bolt, however, goes just past Sorâ€™s ear.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another worker, seeing Cole shooting at his comrade, takes aim and fires. The shot hits Cole in the shoulder (dealing 6 points damage).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Danyeal pulls out his sub-repeating blaster and letâ€™s the worker whoâ€™d been holding him have it. The worker takes the shot in the gut, leaving a smoking hole in the workerâ€™s front torso. The worker grunts before collapsing to the plaza floor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two more workers, seeing Danyeal blow away their leader, level their blasters at the young nobel.
> **â€Workersâ€ wrote:**
>
> **DIE GIRLY DIE!**

The first shot hits (dealing 13 points damage), however the second shot misses as Danyeal staggered out of his line of fire.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lyle reaches out with the Force and grabs the worker whoâ€™d been firing at him (I assume). The worker struggles ueselssly as he finds himself flung through the air at his compatriot. The two slam together, and Lyle hears the sounds of their heads cracking together. Both men go limp as they collapse to the plaza floor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A final worker takes a shot at Lyle, but due to being freaked out at seeing his friends flying through the air, misses completely. No bystanders are hit.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zeyn has now caught up with the main bunch of the battle.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorâ€™s lined up shot misses the worker whoâ€™d been holding Danyeal (since heâ€™s dead and all), but hits the worker whoâ€™d been standing behind him and shooting at Danyeal. The hit takes the worker in the shoulder, but does not drop him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jaceâ€™s popped off shot hits the worker straight between the eyes. The worker stumbles back for a second before falling backwards with a smoking hole in his forehead, dead.

As Sazaks left the Twiâ€™lek toddler to her fate, she managed to be the first to cross the skywalk. Making it to the other side, Sazaks was greeted by armed Coruscant Security personel. The quartet of mixed species was running towards the plaza, but saw the Ubese with two rifles in her hands. The Rodian in the group raised his rifle to his shoulder and screamed,

The two workers werenâ€™t finished with Hayden yet. Undaunted, began to hammer the young Jedi with blaster bolts. But they werenâ€™t fast enough. The bolts singed the ground where the Jedi *had* been. Jumping into the open space of Coruscant, Hayden was treated briefly to the view of the city from above with nothing holding him up. A quick look down showed that it was indeed several hundred meters to the next level. If Hayden missed, he would end up a smear for the custodial droids to clean up.
However, the Force was with Hayden and he landed in the back of the air shuttle without any problems.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two of the workers, convinced that their comrade could handle the â€˜masked freakâ€™ turned their attention towards Cole and combined their fire power with the worker who shot at Cole earlier. Two of the shots hit Cole in the side (dealing 6 & 7 points damage, respectively).
The third worker ran up to Sor and grabbed for his gun hand. However, Sor deftly slid his hand to the side and avoided being grappled. Then, in a display of dexterity and grace, Sor steps to the side and takes a shot at the worker. The shot hits, but unfortunately the worker managed to roll to the side and only took a grazing hit.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Danyeal caught his breath before turning to run after the toddler, the human that previously shot at him leveled his blaster once again. But, before he could get his shot off, his view was blocked by Lyle. The blue blade didnâ€™t stop the worker, though, he simply shot at Lyle instead. But, the distraction of a lightsaber wielding Jedi through off the worker enough to where he missed the shot completely.
Danyeal, with Lyle covering him, managed to get ahead of the crowd just in time to make it to the youngling. Swooping the toddler up in his arms, Danyeal prevented the child from being trampled.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

And the crowd goes wild!

The last worker manages to shake off the effects of seeing his friends thrown about by the force and lined up his shot. The bolt streaked through the air and past the young Jediâ€™s blade straight into his chest. (critical hit dealing 18 points of damage)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zeyn, making it to the first worker in the bunch, slammed his fist into the workerâ€™s head. He was rewarded with the somewhat beautiful sound of bone cracking. The humanâ€™s eyes rolled into the back of his head, and he was out cold.

Sazaks sprayed the blaster bolts all over the roof top she was standing on. Beings of all types screamed behind her as the bolts rang out. Three of the troopers were in the blast range of the commando rilfe, but were able to dodge out of most of the fire, still taking hits, though. Three of the men grunted as the bolts singed into their armor.
Then the soldier who wasnâ€™t hit by bolts pulled his hand back and lobbed a small sphere into the air. The sphere fell a little short of Sazaks, but she was still caught in the shockwave of electrical stun energy that rippled through the area around her. (6 points damage stun damage)
The other three security officers raised their blaster rifles to their shoulders again. Sazaks heard one of them shout,
> **Security Personnel wrote:**
>
> Take it down alive! Stun only!

One of the shots went wild as a spasm went through the guard, but the other two shots rang true. (6 points and 5 points stun damage)
A ding is heard and another group of security personnel come pouring out of the turbolift. Two of them join the original quartet in pointing their rifles at Sazaks. The others run across the skywalk towards the blaster fight going on in the plaza.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two workers continue trying to take shots at Hayden, but with him standing in the air shuttle, the shots go wild.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cole, both blasters raised, tags both of his targets with perfectly aimed blaster bolts. Both men doubled over in pain as the blaster bolts ripped through their abdomens. They fell over dead.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Hayden moved into the cockpit, the pilot turned around with what at first looked like defiance on his face. However, after one look at the lightsaber, the pilot nodded slowly and began to take the ship down slowly towards the plaza.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two of the workers, seeing the large Freeorin pummeling his way through the crowd, turned their blasters on him. However, the sight of the unarmed brute taking a comrade down with one hit made one of them scared enough to miss their shots, but not the second. The third shot nicks Zeyn in the shoulder. (5 points damage)
The third worker leveled his blaster at Lyle and took a shot. However, Lyle, flowing with the Force, jumped out of the way as the blaster pocked the floor where heâ€™d been standing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Danyealâ€™s words do little to stifle the younglingâ€™s sobs. He can hear her screaming â€œDaddyâ€ over and over again in Ryl.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zeyn missed the worker heâ€™d been charging for as the blaster bolt made his arm twitch at the wrong moment. Zeynâ€™s quick head count told him that there were five workers still standing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorâ€™s shot hit the target. Electrical stun energy ripples over the worker as he groins in pain and passes out on the floor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jace might have been impressed with his first shot, but not his second. His shot hit a grandstand instead of the worker heâ€™d been aimed for.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The other three workers still standing and see that theyâ€™re outnumbered. They look at the litter of bodies around the plaza and at the group of supposed civilians whoâ€™ve now managed to route the other nine workers and the landing air shuttle that was supposed to be their get away. One by one, they throw their hold-outs on the ground and put their hands in the air.

"CanÂ´t do that sir, theyÂ´re a part of me. I left my rifle when landing as ordered"
Brushing his shoulder where the bolt had struck him, he dismissed the experience as just another scorch mark on his battle-worn armor. Looking around among the security personnel, he hoped to at least find someone he might recognize. It had been some time since he last served with the Republic military, at least officially, but maybe someone would still be around.

Cole didn't even need to peer over his shoulder to know that it was the security guards giving the order to drop their weapons. Yet, he found himself glancing to the side to confirm it what he already suspected as he kept his blasters aimed at the other workers. Still seething with anger form the injuries he took, his desire to blast the last remaining workers into dust was strong. However, he was not anxious to find out what would happen if he did not do as ordered. He gave a quick tally of guns trained at them as he lowered his pistols slowly and placed them on the ground.
"One of these men", carefully motioning to the workers," put something in the platform over there before the fight started. It might be grenades or some kind of explosive." He says pointing in the direction of the platform. Watching the guard's body language, Cole tries to see if it would be wise for him to move in an attempt to help the wounded.

Sazaks didn't like the odds she was up against, Even though they were simply using stun blasts, there was nothing to be gained by letting them arrest her once more. She makes a run towards the nearest railing. Taking the small grappling hook and liquid rope dispenser from her utility belt she hooks the railing and jumps over, descending to the nearest balcony below her, and hopefully fewer angry men with blasters.

As the speeder hovers right above the platform, Haden purposefully stabs his lightsaber right into the console, watching as the electronics sputter and die out, and, on-queue, the vessel drops with a thud onto the platform, permanently disabled. Leading the lone pilot out by the end of his blade, he doesn't even flinch at the sight of Munten's men.

Sazaks hook went beautifully around the railing. As stun bolts rang around her, she leapt over the edge of the building and down the side. Fifteen meters she descended, till the end of her rope dispenser. And still no balcony. The building was sheer the whole way down for another fifty meters. She finds the view amazing as she sees so much around and so much empty space below her. The part of the building sheâ€™s currently facing has transparisteel windows. Through them, she can see more Coruscant Security Guards coming into the room and ushering out the beings who had been having a meeting of some sort.
From above comes the voice of the Rodian security guard again.

Make your choice.

As if to punctuate his statement, the guards inside the buildingâ€™s window raise their rifles.

Seeing the crying girl, the soldiers confiscated the blaster from Danyeal, but also lowered their own rifles.
Finally turning towards Haydan, Munten looks at him before responding.

Muntenâ€™s little speech was interrupted by an authoritative voice booming over the plaza.
> Thatâ€™s quite enough, Sergeant. These gentle beings were invited here by me.

Sergeant Munten turned around and quickly lowered his weapon and his head.
> **Sergeant Munten wrote:**
>
> Of course, Chancellor Salm. I was just doing my duty. These beings here participated in a fire fight that cost a few civilians and threatened others, sir.

The human that you now know to be Supreme Chancellor Fyor Salm, claps a hand on Muntenâ€™s shoulder and looks him in the face.
> **Chancellor Fyor wrote:**
>
> I completely understand, Sergeant. You did your duty very well. I would also like to commend the security forces for their timely arrival as well. Without a doubt, these civilians saved many lives today. Iâ€™d also suggest that you take the young soldier at his word and check out the platforms on the western edge of the plaza.

Turning towards the group, he says,
> **Fyor wrote:**
>
> Gentle beings. Thank you so much for helping out with this incident. Emergency Medical Services are on their way. Please take advantage of their arrival and get yourselves patched up. When your ready, please come up to my office. We have much to discuss.

As Fyor turns and walks away, his personal guards following him, Munten motions for his men to take the workers into custody. You hear the sirens of the medics coming onto the scene and taking care of the beings who have been injured.
A Twiâ€™lek security guard walks over to Danyeal and holds his hands out to the small child. Danyeal notices their head tails twitching and vibrating as they look at each other. The child leans out of Danyealâ€™s arms, reaching for the officer. The officer takes her over to the medics and has her checked out.
As Zeyn is being looked at, he feels a solid thump in his back. Turning around, he looks into the face of a Togarian male. Heâ€™s smiling from furry pointed ear to furry pointed ear. Zeyn recognizes the furred male as Dankin, a soldier from the old days. Heâ€™s looking a bit older now.
> Zeyn! How you been, old man? Long time no see.

After the medics take care of the group (all returned to full hp and condition track), their weapons are returned to them and Sergeant Munten offers to take them up to the Chancellorâ€™s office himself.

"E Chu Tah."

He glanced around at the others as they were taken care of by the medics. Spotting the human who spoke up on his behalf, Cole began walking over to him only to stop part of the way when he noticed the lightsaber hanging from (Lyleâ€™s) his belt. To his surprise the man was Jedi. All his life heâ€™d been taught by his clan to distrust the Jedi through stories they told when he was a child. Even his own father whose distrust was based on experience warned him to never trust them. Yet, today he did not see any of the things they warned him of. In fact, what he saw during the battle was the exact opposite. Perhaps, his clan was right about the Jedi they had encountered but today Cole would make a choice based on his own experiences. He continued towards the Jedi and extended his hand to Lyle as he introduced himself. â€œMy name is Cole.â€

Falling all fifty meters to the next balcony, Sazaks had a brief feeling of freedom surge through her veins as she experienced a weightlessness in free fall. She felt it, that is, until she collided with the balcony below. (58 points of damage)
The world around her seems to darken little by little, until it all goes black. The last thing Sazaks hears is the sound of a sired getting closer. However, that sound is slowly drowned out by the sound her her heart beating slower and slower, till not at all.

As the door to the turbo lift opens on the upper floors, you're treated to a magnificent view of the upper reaches of Coruscant. You can see why the poets call it the Jewel of the Galaxy. Bright, gleaming spires reach towards the heavens with a perfectly polished shine. As you walk into the offices, a service droid walks over towards you.
> **Droid wrote:**
>
> Greetings, I am K-2AI, but you can call me Kari. The Chancellor has had to make an unscheduled detour before meeting with you. May I serve you something to drink while you wait?

The droid motions with her hand towards several very comfortable seats. As you walk towards the seating area, you see a large Wookie wearing brown Jedi robes. Lyle and Haydan immediately recognize Master Ralraccor, member of the Jedi Council and currently the only member of the Order to hold the position of Grand Master. Danyeal also recognizes Ralraccor, but from news holos and the such.
Ralraccor is sitting down at a holo terminal speaking with another Jedi through the holonet. His woofs and barks are unintelligible to you, but the other Jedi seems to understand them just fine. Haydan and Lyle recognize the other Jedi as Kradaro, a Cathar Jedi who has been known to disagree with the council on a regular basis. Master Ralraccor seems very agitated with Kradero as he speaks.

Master Ralraccor returns to bow towards the two padawans. He opens his mouth and woofs gently,

He motions towards Kari, who turns towards you and translates.

Master Ralraccor nods as she translates. Then he continues, though this time you can tell that he's not as happy due to the long series of his barks and the angry look on his face.

Master Ralraccor points out that the Sergeant is simply a public servant, much like you, who had a duty to do. A duty that he did very well given the circumstances. Master Ralraccor says that you are not to insult another public servant again. He also says that you are to apologize to Sergeant Munten after this meeting is completed. He finishes by asking if you understand his instructions.

Master Ralraccor looks at Haydan expectantly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After an half hour or so, the office doors open and in walks Chancellor Fyor. As he walks through the room, he smiles at each of your and shakes several hands on his way through the office. Ever the diplomat. When he sees Ralraccor, he walks straight towards the elderly Jedi and embraces the Wookie as best as a human can.
> **Fyor wrote:**
>
> Master Ralraccor, I&#39;m so happy to see you again. I trust that your son is well?

Ralraccor nods his head vigorously at the mention of his own youngling. Fyor then turns towards the group and begins.
> **Fyor wrote:**
>
> Friends, first off I wish to thank you for your help in the plaza today. It is obvious to me that we chose well when we chose you. Your performance of your civic duties is to be commended to the highest extreme. I thank you in the name of the Republic. However, in the best interests of the Republic, the news feeds have no idea who you are or that you helped out at all.

He motions to Kari, who activates a large holodisplay in the center of the room. Several holograms show at once, displaying the various news coverages of the plaza incident. Indeed, no mention is made of the group helping out.
> **Fyor wrote:**
>
> As you can see, we&#39;ve fed the news a story that the Coruscant Security Forces were able to contain the terrorists in time. By the way, young Master Trenor, thank you for the tip about the repulsorlift platforms. The one that I am scheduled to deliver my speech from tomorrow was indeed set with an explosive. A thermal detonator, to be exact. The amount of damage that that would have caused to tomorrow&#39;s viewers in the grand stand is unknown, but the bomb specialists tell me that it possessed enough explosives to take out half the plaza.

Fyor pauses to catch his breath before continuing.
> **Fyor wrote:**
>
> However, you might be wondering what exactly is the reason for withholding the information about your help. It&#39;s simple, we need a team that the Maw doesn&#39;t know about. Unfortunately, The Maw has come to recognize every member of the Coruscant Security Force by face, and will disperse at their first glance. We don&#39;t want to continue scaring them off. We want to capture them and finish this. So, for that reason, we had to keep your participation in today&#39;s events a secret. If your images and names were plastered all over the holo-net, this mission would be for nothing.
> Now, to continue. The incident you prevented in the plaza today is typical of the past few days. Ever since I made that speech, I&#39;ve been a constant target, though I refuse to bow to their terrorist tactics.

As he speaks, the images on the holoprojector change to show various scenes of violence and bombings.
> **Fyor wrote:**
>
> In each chase, the bombings were claimed by The Maw Group. The Maw Group, so far as we have been able to figure, is a terrorist group dedicated to dissolving the Senate of the Republic. Their main tactic seems to be to sow distrust for the Republic by making attacks that make people think the Republic cannot protect them. We&#39;ve managed to route them for the most part, but as I said earlier, we don&#39;t want to route them, we want to catch them and end this.

Everyone in the group has heard something of The Maw Group. The news holos have had several reports on them. Everyone knows that The Maw Group attacks public utilities in an effort to disrupt traffic, communications, weather, and commerce on Coruscant.
Danyeal's also heard about The Maw Group on his travels. He's also heard that the leaders of The Maw Group were killed in a firefight with Coruscant Security Forces a few weeks ago. He's also heard that their manifesto indicates that they believe the Senate to be corrupt and secretly manipulated by corporate concerns to benefit specific corporations at the expense of the common sentiment.
Jace's heard the most. He's heard all the previous things mentioned as well as that most members of The Maw Group are human. The few non-humans appear to be tolerated as necessary for success, rather than embraced as part of the movement. He's also heard that the current "leader" of The Maw Group is a Corellian named Zegmon Pent - a former smuggler with political leanings. Within his own circles, Zegmon claims to have been trained by the Jedi Order as a Jedi Assassin. He claims that the Jedi sent him on missions to assassinate politicians, business beings, anyone that got in the Order's or the Republic's way. He claims to have Force powers.

Danyeal turned his head at the Large Alien (Zyne)

Danyeal points at the Large Alien (Zyne)
"..all you were concerned with was smashing their skulls, deep down you are nothing more then a primitive who enjoys nothing but violence."
Danyeal then points over to Lyle
"The Jedi jumped in front of then men to protect me as I ran to save the child, as far as I am concerned he is the only one who is here for the right reasons."
Danyeal then walks out the door towards the turbo lifts with one last remark loud enough for all to hear.
"Why should I even bother to explain myself to a primitive, all you understand is answering violence with more violence."
Danyeal waits for the Lift as he tries to hide his fear and anger...the Large Alien was half right but it was mostly that Danyeal wasn't a fighter, in fact he tried to stop the terrorist before they even started but he failed and it cost the child her father....

"I know exactly why I`m here. IÂ´m here because 200 years of service to this Republic hasnÂ´t managed to kill me and theyÂ´re guessing IÂ´ll last a little longer. And also because of a certain TwiÂ´lek with a large drinking account..."

"Fierfek, I'm stuck with a bunch of squabbling children." Sor mutters, barely audible. He turns to the chancellor, saying, "I'm more than happy to help of course, but if I may ask, what exactly did you hear about me that made you approach me?" Sor had done nothing that would merit the chancellor's attention aside from his vigilante work which was, by its nature, illegal. He didn't think that the chancellor of the Republic would simply overlook a crime like vigilantism.

Danyeal walks back into the room and takes a seat, he sits there shuffling his Sabacc cards in his hands.

"All I need now is a glass of Corillia's finest in my hand. What would you like the stakes to be good sir." Jace is more then willing to drink the chanselors fine spirits and take Danyeal hard earned credits while waiting to find out what is going on. Looking around. "Where did that driod go?

Hospital:
After her next Bacta treatment, Sazaks was transferred to the ward for non-oxygen breathers. This was much more comfortable for the Ubese woman, as it reduced the number of sentients that came to see what a member of her race looked like without their environmental suits. Her long slender frame would be very attractive by human standards, and she'd have had endless proposals for company if her personality was only less abrasive.
But even this minor thing had come at a price. Not only were there still armed guards covering all the exits, but the woman had also needed to make multiple promises of good behavior and agree to have a tracking bracelet attached to her foot. At least she was able to follow the Pod Races on Malestare.

Haden bites his lower lip as he gets a helping of humility. Though Munten had acted unfavorably, he doubted he could convince the Master that his outburst was a result of frustration, and that it may be excused. The Master appeared adamant, and either way, the act merited an apology..by Jedi ethics.
"**If that is your wish, Grand Master,**" recited Haden. He wasn't quite sure how he was going to go about burning that bridge while saving face, but he suspected that disobeying Ralraccor on this would be probably unwise.
He listened intently with the others as the Chancellor made his announcement. Word of the Maw Group, had, indeed, been holding ears throughout the capital. The thought of catching them brought chills down the Jedi's spine, but to share the credit with such a haphazard group of mercenaries and soldiers? It was going to be a long assignment.
He wanted to ask whether the Chancellor's investigation had uncovered any leads, but apparently, he had already been beaten to the query.

"Why thank you Chancelor." Jace bows deeply. "I had no idea you where a fan." He sighs taking the sabacc deck and starts to shuffle the cards. "This is going to take us to a places that are not pretty and could be considered in some circle as down right evil. So if any of you have a problem nows the time to say so. Cause if I sit down at the table to play, I play to win no matter the cust." Jace has never backed away from anything in his life he has had to do things that weren't pretty and nice at all but that is what it takes to survive in his world.

Sor has heard the usual news, that the Maw Group is a terrorist group that typically blows up public buildings. Recently they've made threats against the Chancellor.

However, his claims have made some beings anxious about the thought of a Jedi insurrection. Rubbish, of course, but some beings are still scared. That&#39;s something that I hope can be another benefit to this mission with this team. Two Jedi on this team, working for the good of the Republic, and helping to take down Pent would help alleviate most of the doubters.

Fyor makes another motion towards Kari, who again changes the holodisplay. This time it is a security display of the Chancellor's office, the plaza and the immediate area.
> **Fyor wrote:**
>
> We have determined that The Maw Group intends to disrupt my speech tomorrow. Now, how they plan on going about this is what we **don&#39;t** know. Obviously one plan included the bombs that you saw earlier this morning planted in the platform that I was to be speaking from. While that plan has been thwarted, we know from past experience that the Maw Group always has a backup plan. Now, judging from past incidents with the Maw Group and local chatter on the holonet that our slicers have uncovered, we believe that we&#39;ve uncovered two more aspects of their plans for tomorrow.

The hologram shifts its point of view to show a tall tower that overlooks most of the buildings in the area.
> **Fyor wrote:**
>
> This building here is the local weather control station. It prevents major storms by controlling the ionization of the local atmosphere and bleeding off the excess energy. If this building were to be deactivated before tomorrow&#39;s speech&#8230;

The hologram shows storm clouds building up over the plaza.
> **Fyor wrote:**
>
> However, if the computer were to be reprogrammed to **purposefully** ionize the local atmosphere&#8230;

The display now shows the storm clouds beginning to discharge lightning strikes all over the plaza. Within a few minutes, the entire plaza, and all of the simulated people in the display, are burned and destroyed.
Fyor clears his throat as the display shifts to another tower, this one with various struts spiraling out from the center hub.
> **Fyor wrote:**
>
> Enough of that. I think we all understand the potential danger there. The second location of interest is here, the local traffic control center. From this building&#39;s location, the Maw Group could redirect traffic, causing accidents. Or worse, they could redirect traffic, allowing an air shuttle carrying explosives to get close enough to the plaza.

The display shows an air shuttle coming in towards the plaza, full of simulated beings, before it crashes into the center, destroying everything.
> **Fyor wrote:**
>
> Now, in order for this second scenario to work, the Maw Group would have to take control of the traffic tower and almost immediately make their attack on the plaza. Security forces would arrive too quickly for them to maintain control for very long. We feel that they will make their move, whatever it is, during the next ten standard hours before my speech. Again, we can&#39;t simply send Coruscant Security to handle this. The Maw Group recognizes them and runs off, which *might* prevent tomorrow&#39;s attack, but not the next one, or the next. We need to catch these terrorists in the act and put them away for ever, much like you did today.
> Now, my security advisers suggest that you should take control of the weather tower earlier. As I previously mentioned, the traffic control tower would need to be taken fairly close to tomorrow&#39;s speech, but the tower could be reprogrammed at any time with a delayed program set to go off later.
> Now, to assist you in this endeavor, I have procured weapons permits for each of you, just in case. Since we do not know if we have a spy in our midst, I have never made this part of public records. This meeting never happened, and you are not working for the Republic. You are working for me. Because of that, Coruscant Security has no idea that you are on official business and will detain anyone carrying a weapon without a permit. However, though you have a permit, I must ask you to be careful out there. Coruscant is a densely populated city. If you fire a shot and miss your target, odds are you will hit something, or someone, else. Please take care.
> Now, to Master Pavon&#39;s question as to a fee. While the Jedi could be expected to do these jobs out of altruism, I know that the rest of you have a living to earn. I have managed to put together a small collection of funds. I say small because it is off the books of the Republic. Again, you are not officially in the Republic&#39;s employ. Therefore, whatever pay you receive, comes from my personal accounts. While I am Chancellor of the Republic, I am not made of credits. I am prepared to offer you two-thousand credits, to divide up as you see fit. And, depending on how well this mission goes, I am prepared to offer you a one-thousand credit per month retainer. Will that suffice for now, Master Pavon?

I would be lying to you if I were to say that the possibility of a victory didn&#39;t tempt me. That&#39;s why I have such high hopes for all of you. I made a vow in a public address a few weeks ago that I would see to it that The Maw Group was routed from Coruscant before the next senatorial session. If you are successful, then that vow will be fulfilled. That will grant me quite a bit of political capital in the Senate. The people will view me in a much better light if I appear to be victorious in the face of terrorists here in the capital. Senators will want to share in that better light and will align themselves against The Maw Group and terrorists in general. Most likely, many of them will make statements saying that they never had any doubt in me, that the fight against such tactics should continue, etc. When I begin to use that political capital to target the criminal elements entrenched in our government, some of the Senators will follow to ensure their positions with their constituents. Even Senator Kiren Lor&#39;lon from Bothuwai might join our bandwagon at that point.

Chancellor Fyor smiles at Danyeal at that last comment. Danyeal remembers that Lor'lon was the senator he'd worked for when he ran into all those troubles.
Looking over towards Lyle, the Chancellor noded. Before he could answer, however, Master Ralraccor barked out loud.

I took the liberty of acquiring a few sets of non-descript blast vests. Many visitors to Coruscant employ body guards, and you should be able to blend in fairly well. I&#39;ve also managed to get my hands on some other supplies. Medpacs, power and energy packs, things that no one would notice me bringing in. Unfortunately, I could not obtain new weaponry. That would have drawn too much attention. Finally, I have also obtained use of two air-shuttles for the next 24 hours. I&#39;m afraid that this was all I was able to line up without drawing unwanted attention.

"With all due respect Chancellor, I was thinking of something a little more sturdy than a blast vest. Those things can barely stop a slug round, much less a blaster bolt.

As Zeyn is making his comment about the sturdiness, or lack thereof, of blast vests, Kari, who'd been standing off to the side, picks its head up and walks to the door. She opens it and waves in the newest visitor. Zeyn sees Dankin coming in with a large bag over his shoulders. He nods to the Chancellor before putting the bag on a table.

Sor barely talked during the meeting, as he made a habit of only speaking when he had something to say. However, when Danyeal suggested each team have a slicer, he finally spoke up. "I'm quite handy with a computer when I need to be. I should probably be in the weather control tower to fix anything the enemy might have done to it."

> Folks, if I could make a suggestion of my own. I would suggest that you not split up, since The Maw Group might strike in force after today&#39;s events. However, if you were to split up, I agree that an even division of abilities might be best. I&#39;d suggest that a team heading towards the Weather Control Tower should consist of Masters Pavon, Larn, Kroga, and my old buddy Zeyn. The team heading towards the Traffic Control Tower should consist of Masters Young, Trenor, and Lander. That way, with the Traffic Control Tower being a lower priority, if the Maw Group should hit the Weather Control Tower first and then run for the Traffic Control Tower, you can regroup after the larger group handled the first threat.

After the group decides if and how to split up, Kari walks up with a tray of medpacs, power packs, and energy packs, enough for each person to take four of each.

In the Coruscant hospital, Sazaks lays in her bed with her breathing equipment providing her special atmospheric mix. She's strapped to the bed to ensure that she doesn't attack her visitor. Two guards are in the room to also ensure security. As Sazaks looks to the side, she sees her visitor wears brown robes and a lighter brown loose tunic.
A Jedi healer.
Sazaks feels the power of the Force as the Jedi proceeds to knit the Ubese's broken bones and stitched flesh. In a few minutes, the bounty hunter is completely healed. The Jedi stands and looks down at the Jedi hating patient. She says,

Sazaks didn't say anything to the Jedi Healer, that came into the room to tend to her injuries. The entire time the Ubese woman didn't make eye contact, feeling violated but thankful that she would be out of the hospital that much sooner.
Once she was dressed once more in her familiar Environmental suit, Sazaks felt comfortable once more. By habit she double checked the seals, before taking up her Commando rifle, and ensuring it was fully charged, along with the replacement Energy Cell on her Utility Belt.

Danyeal smiles when he sees Esrynn and after hearing what she had to say, he believed things may get far worse then he expected but now they knew to look for it.
Danyeal reaches for Esrynn hand and gives it a kiss
"Well I think your as Beautiful as you are talented..."
Danyeal looks over as Sor states his thoughts and leaves.
"..as for my companions...well you know how my luck is with deals I make with Politicians but at least one of them saved my life, lucky me he is a Jedi."
Danyeal gestures for Esrynn to walk with him a bit away from the others not to hear.
"As for the info, yeah I think it is a bit odd....I am starting to wonder if maybe these so called Maw fellows are not perhaps in league with certain Political figures."
Danyeal hands Esrynn 300 Credits and a kiss
"Listen I may be in over my head...again..but look up anything you can on that Captain and any associates of his...Political or otherwise and be extremely careful, can't lose my favorite person in the Galaxy now can I?"

As Cole walked over to the Turbolift his heart began to beat fast an adrenaline pumped through his veins with fear of the unknown. He wondered how this battle would go for a moment. Cole took a deep breath and pushed asside his angst to plan for what was to come and to focused on the entrances as he wondered how the Maw might try to get in. He wanted to look over the entrances to see if there is any of them worked in their favor strategically. *Perhaps we should block one of the entrances so that there is a limited amount of ways to get in. Although, if we do that it could alert them that something is wrong. I can't see us blocking the windows. Maybe Sor can fix the turbolift from working. He womders as he looks over the area. Where would the best possible ways to get through if I wanted to get in?* He wondered. He looked around briefly for any creates that could be used for cover as he moved towards the lift.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Weather Control Tower</span>
The door opens for Sor and Lyle to enter the turbolift. Lyle doesnâ€™t sense anything wrong with going up to the control room, but does feel slightly cautious.
Esrynn pockets the credits and rewards Danyeal with a smile, her fur rippling in a way that Danyeal reads as happy.
> **Esrynn wrote:**
>
> Well, Iâ€™ll see what I can find out *leannÃ¡n*.

She walks back to a smaller speeder floating nearby and jumps in. As she drives out, she blows a kiss and winks at Danyeal.
Lyle heard the whole conversation.
As Cole enters the lift, the doors shut and the lift ascends to the top floor of the Weather Control Tower. When it opens, everyone sees a transparisteel window directly in front of them, giving them a beautiful view of the Coruscant skyline. In the distance, you can even make out the plaza where the Chancellor will be speaking tomorrow. Clouds seem to be building around the plaza. To the left is a shut door. To the right is a second shut door that leads to the weather control center.
Inside the control center are four humans who are **not** dressed in worker clothing. One of them is typing furiously away at the computer terminal while the other three watch on. Out side the window behind them is an open-back air shuttle with two more people inside, one of whom is piloting.
One of the three humans in the control room looks up at the group as they exit the turbolift, says something terse to his companions, and draws a hold-out blaster from his coat. These men are serious.
(Initiative = Danyeal, Sor, Terrorist 1, Cole, Terrorists 5, 2, 6, Lyle, Terrorists 3-4)
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Traffic Control Tower</span>
As Jace takes aim at the man in the tower with the comlink, he hears a screaming **NO!** in his head. This man is simply a traffic control officer, not a terrorist.
Fortunately, Zeynâ€™s hand manages to knock Jaceâ€™s blaster out of the way so that the shot goes skyward, lost in the atmosphere. However, the sound of another blaster bolt ringing through the air scares the beings even more.
As Jace flies off in the speeder, though, he gets a second feeling in his gut. This is going to go badly. As he flies around the tower, he sees why. In the distance, maybe a minute or two out, are three squad shuttles heading towards the tower, maybe a minute or two out. Nothing else out of the ordinary for a tower that has screaming citizens and guns blazing on it.
No one has started shooting back at the group yet. The workers inside the tower seem more interested in getting the civilians inside the tower and down the turbolifts. Though, they are keeping an eye on the group.
Everyone on the tower begins to hear sirens in the distance.

The Weather Control Center was a remarkably cramp space. All of the terrorists were crammed together around the console. Danyealâ€™s sub-repeating blaster sent out an arch of bright death that tore through the plastic windows like a Gamorrean at a buffet. The plastic shattered and collapsed as the rest of Danyealâ€™s bolts tore through three of the guards, with the forth one having dived beneath the console. The three bodies collapsed backward over the other consoles before slumping to the floor.
The forth terrorist risked a quick peak over the console. It was a risk he shouldnâ€™t have taken. All that was left after Sorâ€™s blaster bolt ripped through the air was a charred torso holding a hold-out pistol that now slumped over a console.
Coleâ€™s dual drawn pistols ring out individually a fraction of a second after Danyealâ€™s and Sorâ€™s, but since all of the terrorists in the room are dead, the shots instead ping into the transparisteel window behind them. The first shot simply scorched the material while the second shot shattered it.
The terrorists in the air shuttle see the carnage of what was left of their comrades. The one in the back turned his head and shouted,
> **â€Terroristâ€ wrote:**
>
> **RUN!**

before firing a shot at the person running towards them, ... Sor. The bolt hit Sor right in the shoulder, but was barely a flesh wound. The terrorist is a lousy shot. (5 points damage)
The pilot of the air shuttle, however, didnâ€™t waste any time at all and kicked in the shuttleâ€™s full power, which isnâ€™t too terribly much as the speeder only makes it eighteen meters away before it stops in mid air. It just hangs there, waiting.
However, anyone whoâ€™d been paying attention would have noticed that as the pilot pulled away, his friend suddenly lifted in mid air and slammed into him. Had anyone been close enough to hear, they would have heard the sound of boneâ€™s cracking as the two skulls rang together. Theyâ€™re out cold.
(OOC: How I **wanted** to write that scene. Imagine Duel of the Fates in the background, especially the vocalization part.)
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Lyle stands in front of the window, surrounded by dead bodies, drawn saber in one hand, the other outstretched, manipulating the Force. The shuttle tries to surge again and again, unable. Finally, Lyle retracts his hand into a fist at his side, pulling through the energy that binds all things. The shuttle wavers a second before flying backwards, crashing into the tower and stopping less than a meter in front of Lyle, who hasnâ€™t moved at all. The passengers, having hit their heads on the consoles, are out cold. The engine whines for a few more seconds before it too goes cold.

Sor's time is not wasted as he quickly finds the viral program in the computers which is set to unleash lightning strikes on the plaza five minutes after the chancellor's speech begins. Another few minutes and Sor will have the program stopped.
After a minute of searching, Danyeal found four hold-out blaster pistols, one on each terrorist. He also found two workers stashed in a console panel, dead. It also occurs to Danyeal that the speeder is still sitting 18 meters out from the tower, just hovering in mid air.

Haden turns his head just in time to watch Sazaks fire a blaster in the air.

He didn't complain, it was, of course, a great way to thin the suspects. He watches as Jace raises a blaster, aiming at an innocent worker, just as the Feeorin knocks the weapon away to save the day. Small glories.
Haden follows Sazaks and Zeyn, for lack of better term, frighten their way into the building. The howling sirens in the distance meant law enforcement was on it's way. Reinforcements. Reinforcements that fully intended to shoot them to death, yes, but what better deterrent than two dozen armed law-enforcement officers?

Sor glares at his teammates, first Cole, then Lyle. "Can I slice open a hatch? Can I pilot a speeder? You just saw me detect and erase a high-level virus designed to totally reprogram the security systems of a high-level computer made to *control the weather.* I think I can handle those menial tasks." Sor jumps onto the speeder and immediately slices into the hatch's control pad, going about the rather simple process of opening it.

Sor easily slices into the speeder.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Traffic Control Tower</span>
The guards listen to Jace's story of woe and crazy Ubese women, and it looks like they might believe him, until the see the heavy blaster pistol hanging from his side. Five of the ten security agents raise their blaster rifles to their shoulders. Already a little twitchy with the recent terrorist attacks, they don't hesitate and open fire.
(Init: Security 9, Jace, Security 2, Zeyn, Security 4, Tower Worker 2, Security 3 & 5, Sazaks, Haden, Security 8, 7, 10, Tower Worker 1, Security 6, 1)
The first security agent fires his shot which hits Jace in the chest. He can feel the electrical charge of a stun bolt that weakens his body, slightly. (11 points stun damage/2 = 5 points actual damage)
Inside the tower, the tower worker attacking Haden stops on his second attack, his eyes wide as if fear has gripped him. He turns slightly to the side and shouts over his shoulder to his colleague,
> **Tower Worker 2 wrote:**
>
> We can&#39;t win this fight. **RUN, RUN, RUN!**

He then ignores some of the pedestrians and runs into a turbolift and hits the descend button, leaving a bewildered comrade and about five more civilians. The last worker turns towards you and raises his own baton over head.
> **Tower Worker 1 wrote:**
>
> I don&#39;t know what you did, but I will not abandon these people!

With that corny line probably pulled from some holodrama, the worker charges into attack the Freeorin. However, Zeyn proves to be too adept a soldier and easily side steps the attack. Due to the wild charge that the worker made, he left himself open to Zeyn's counter punch, which lands squarely in the man's gut. He grunts as the massive hand almost knocks the wind out of him, but then looks like he's going to swing again as the last civilians press into the last turbolift.
Outside, while Jace realizes he's surrounded by five of Coruscant Security's finest, he also notices the other 5 heading for the door to the tower, intent on getting in.

Inside the Control Center of the tower, Zeyn, Haden, and Sazaks heard similar warnings from Dankin.
Sazaks, Zeyn, and Haden hear a beeping sound coming from one of the tower terminals.
As Sor weaves and bobs through the sky lanes, finally coming to the clearer sections, he notices something odd. The computer continues to scream at him to change course or he will be detained, but his isn't the only air shuttle disobeying the rule. By this point, the lanes have cleared enough for Sor to see clearly to confirm what the shuttle's sensors tell him. The other shuttle is heading straight towards the Traffic Control Tower. It is not broadcasting an official transponder like those of the Coruscant Security Shuttles. The shuttle's undercarriage also appears to have been modified.
Jace, Lyle, and Haden all feel something in the pit of their guts, but only Lyle can figure out what it is at the moment.
That shuttle means to kill people.

Dankinâ€™s comments remind Zeyn of a time when they were working undercover on Kessel, trying to catch a couple of murders whoâ€™d convinced the prison community to hide them. Zeyn had entrenched himself with the local criminals, but Dankin had been discovered. Zeyn had been forced to rough Dankin up a bit and throw him outside without a mask to keep his cover.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sazaks manages to get the computer to show her that the oncoming craft is not alone. That two air shuttles are currently in route towards the Traffic Control Tower, flying straight through the no fly zone surrounding it at the moment. Both shuttles were reported stolen earlier this morning.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Haden sees that there are only two ways out of the tower, the turbolifts and the speeders parked outside with the security agents. The turbolifts are currently resting on the street level floor and will take at least a full minute to reach the control center.

As Jace walks out into the open with his hands raised, he notices five security agents pointing rifles at his chest. One of them lowers his rifle and retrieves his weapons.

As Cole looks around the shuttle, he finds nothing of use. The terrorists had been traveling light. It occurs to Cole, however, that if Sor were to get into the wingman position with relation to Pentâ€™s shuttle, a window could be lowered and blaster could be used to disable the shuttleâ€™s engines. That is, assuming someone could make the shot. It also occurs to Cole that Lyleâ€™s zip line idea could work if Sor could get close enough to Pent **and** hold the shuttle steady.

"Boom." Sazaks says, as she looks at the two stolen shuttles in the air. Leaving the console, she snatches up her rifle once again, and head to a hatch leading to the roof of the traffic control tower. There must have been some way up there for maintenance if nothing else.
"Warn your friend, Stolen shuttles in the air."
Once on the roof, Sazaks lays on her back, blaster rifle pointed skyward, as she waits to take a shot at the first of the stolen Air Shuttles. With any luck she'd hit a repulsor coil.

The Ubese was right on the money in that there was a ladder access to the roof. It had just been out of sight from Haden during his search. As Sazaks lines up her shot and lets it loose, she sees the shuttle juke to the side to avoid the blast.
Dankinâ€™s head whips around to look to the sky at the mention of shuttles. He speaks to his subordinates, but forgets to un-thumb the comlink, thus allowing Zeyn to hear;

One of the security agents runs towards his speeder to find out.

As Sor deftly maneuvers the shuttle into position, his expert piloting leaves little to be desired. Any pilot who was being honest would have to nod their heads to the Kel Dor.
As Lyle opened the window of the cockpit, he noticed that Sor had left him with a beautiful shot for his grappling hook. As the hook launched out and sank into the crevices of the shuttle, Lyle swung out with a flair that would have made professional thieves turn green with envy. He swung out with perfect precision, but as he fell, Pentâ€™s shuttle took a quick juke to avoid a blaster bolt that seemed to come from nowhere. The momentum of the maneuver made Lyle swing on his cable around and land on top of the shuttle with perfect grace.

As Lyle stands on top of the shuttle, he feels a *whump* shudder through the shuttleâ€™s frame. A burst of light erupts from under the shuttle as a projectile shoots out from the shuttle towards the Traffic Control Tower. The missileâ€™s aim, however, was less than perfect. The missile doesnâ€™t strike the tower directly, but instead strikes one of the parking struts. In fact, it strikes the one holding up most of the security agents. The tower strut bends under the blast and folds against the side of the tower.
Everyone on the tower hears the agentsâ€™ various cries as they begin to fall down the rapidly sloping strut. some of them manage to grab hold of hand rails, or seams in the strut to keep themselves from falling. A few unlucky ones, however, plummet towards the street level, towards their death.
Sor hears Pentâ€™s voice coming in over the comlink.

He was, that is, until he had it explained to him that heâ€™d be spending time on Kessel otherwise. It turns out that he had been trying to make a working lightsaber, just like a Jediâ€™s. He says he got it working just fine, even though heâ€™s not a Jedi, or a Force Feeler, or whatever they call themselves.

Sazaks was thrown off the roof, and down the roof access. She managed to catch the top rung, even though her blaster rifle dropped to the floor below. The Ubese woman, dropped down to the floor once again, and reclaimed her rifle.
"We need to leave." She tells the Jedi and Feorin. Making her way back down to the ground, working to undo the tampering to the door she did earlier.

Cole watches as the Jedi lands on the other shuttle. Then turns to Sor with an idea.
To Sor: "I am don't know that much slicing but can you slice into the other shuttle's computer and land their shuttle or maybe lock their missles so they can't fire from here? I am not a pilot but I think I can at least keep this thing in the air while you do that."

"If I had set explosives..." Sazaks replied, sounding defensive. "Would I have been stupid enough to lock us in here? Or failed to drop the entire structure? No it was the shuttles, they are using warheads."
Without any remaining options, The Ubese continued to work at opening the door. Hopefully once its open, she'll be able to take control of one of the Security Speeders, letting her get involved in the combat in the skies overhead.

Sazaks gets the door open to see the carnage outside the control center. One of the landing struts has collapsed on itself from the missile strike. In the distance, now past the tower, Sazaks can spot the two shuttles flying away. It seems that someone is holding on to one of the shuttle's roof by a cable and hook.
Most of the security agents are hanging on for dear life. Zeyn sees Dankin barely holding on to the edge while trying to get one of his agents back onto the main tower. Anyone looking over the edge notices that another agent loses his grip and falls the hundreds of meters to his death below. There are seven agents left, all of them screaming for help.

Sor manages to keep even with Pent's shuttle, but just barely. There is a roof and window to the speeder, making a shot to the driver difficult.
Lyle begins to lose his grip on the cable hook he's holding on to. If he does lose his grip, he realizes that he's hundreds of meters above the street level.

Lyle, about to fall off this crazy ride, realizes that he needs to act quickly. Being that Pent wants him off, and not to disturb is terror bombs, Lyle pulls out his lightsaber ignites it with his left hand and hangs on with only his right hand. Not even thinking about the instant he might fall, or the well being of his right hand, Lyle twists his body around, spinning his arm to get a better hold on the rope. Holding the lightsaber upside down, almost as if wielding it in the offshoot shien style of lightsaber dueling, Lyle begins to cut a small hole through the cargo hold of the shuttle just big enough to fit his size.

Sazak's first instinct was to take one of the Security Shuttles and fly after the others. However leaving the men to die wouldn't qualify as "Good behavior" And even though the Feorrin was already helping people.
Taking her liquid tape dispenser, She secured one end of it to a stable support of some sort. Then she threw the other end over the edge towards one of the struggling security agents. The Ubese woman had given him the tool to save himself, now it was up to him.
Now she ran to the nearest shuttle and took off in pursuit of the warhead laden Shuttles.

Jace hopes that the feeling he had abit ago had place cause if it hadn't he would be dead in no time. "Come on I a good shot and you can use all the help you can get." Jace lloks around at some of the troopers that are hanging on to what was left of what they where standing on. "Besides you are going to have your hands full with them."

Struggling against the weight of the larger Togarian, Zeyn manages to keep his old friend alive long enough for the latter to toss the security agent up on the stable walkway. Then, the two working together manage to get Dankin up on the walkway also. They both collapse onto the walkway, breathing heavy.

She finishes by looking pointedly at the security cameras that line the building and then pointing at the incoming shuttles with sirens blazing. Turning towards Danyeal, Esrynn smiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first time that Lyle tries to make the cut, Pent begins to weave in between the buildings, trying to shake the beings chasing him. The maneuver makes Lyle flop around on the shuttle's roof, though he manages to keep his grips on both his lightsaber and his rope, but he misses the cut. The rope pulled tight on Lyle's handing and began cutting into the human flesh. (2 points damage) However, he did not fall from the shuttle.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After Sazaks threw the rope down towards the agents below, they began scrambling to get on it. Three this round managed to get on the rope and begin climbing up. The other four are moving themselves into position to do so.
The only shuttle she found was the one she came in with. She passes Jace as she heads towards it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Jace comes out of his hiding spot, he realizes that the agents that had been talking to him had been on the other landing strut and were now hanging on for dear life, though some had not made it so far. He saw the Ubese throw some rope down to them and they began to climb up. However, Jace realized that liquid cable can only hold so much, and that if all seven of the agents currently trying climb on, the rope will snap.
As Jace looks and figures this out, he sees one of the agents slip while trying to work his way over towards the rope and fall the hundreds of meters to his death below. Jace also finds his weapons on the landing strut where he tossed them, but he doesn't find any more rope. (OOC: I don't know what's in your utility belt. Standard issue?)
Jace also notices Sazaks heading towards the shuttle he landed a minute ago.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cole manages to secure the line to a handrail in the shuttle and toss the other end out of the window. The speed both shuttles are flying at, however, causes the cable to straighten out in a tail behind the shuttle, flapping in the wind.

Cole shakes his head as he realizes that the cable will not do anything for Lyle with it flapping in the wind. Grabbing the cable, he begins pulling in the other end and then ties it around his waist in hopes that should Lyle fall he can jump from the shuttle and catch him. He looks in Lyle's direction and calls him on the comlink.
To Lyle: "Hold on this is going to get rough."

(7 rounds to plaza)
This time, Lyle is able to cut a hole in the roof of the shuttle. The hole is just big enough for him to slip through.
Cole's shot hits the shuttle cockpit, damaging the transparent dome of the craft. A small hole appears in the window now. Pent sees the shots being taken at him and begins to maneuver to escape. He puts the shuttle into a dive, heading for the main buildings and walkways, clearly intent on losing the tail.
The maneuver yanks Lyle into a free fall as he is pulled down with the shuttle, flying out behind it. The dive pulls at Lyle's arm again, causing his shoulder to feel the burn (3 points damage). The pull also causes Lyle to drop his lightsaber inside the shuttle.
It is clear that Pent doesn't like being shot at or followed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sazaks climbs into the shuttle that she rode over in and kicks it to life. The engines flare up and she's off chasing after the others. At the moment, it's fairly easy to find the shuttles, as a blaster bolt rips through the air and the flashing of a lightsaber in the late evening dusk is easy to pick out in the city. However, she does notice that she's behind the others.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working together, the others are able to retrieve the rest of the security agents from the collapsed landing strut. However, they also realize that there's no shuttle left, as Sazaks left in it.

Quickly he felt for the cable to make sure that he was still fastened to the rail as he let a sigh of relief escape his lips. He was very thankful that he thought of using his cable.

As Sor expertly maneuvers the shuttle around the skywalks and lanes of traffic, he notices that he's beginning to pass Pent's shuttle and pull a little bit ahead.
Lyle deftly maneuvers himself into the shuttle through the small hole that he'd previously cut open. He lands inside a storage compartment, albeit a rather small one. Inside, on the floor he finds his lightsaber. He also finds the handle.
Cole's shots missed the shuttle, striking a skywalk instead. No pedestrians were hurt, as they'd all run away at the sight of two shuttles speeding down towards them.
However, Cole and Sor notice that the side door on the shuttle opens up as they begin to pass, and two thugs, a Rodian and a Human both hold on to the hand rail and begin to open fire on Sor's shuttle. One of the bolts hits the shuttle's side, missing Cole. (4 points damage out of 30)

Danyeal who was in deep thought as how best to do this comes to as Esrynn hands him one of the dead terrorists armor.
"Oh sorry about that everyone...just playing it out in my head on the best way for this to go."
Danyeal takes the armor from Esrynn then begins to put it on as he explains what needs to be done to the Togruta Security Agent.
"Listen I know this may seem odd but if this works we may save a lot of lives and throw the terrorist into into chaos...so just go with me on this and we might pull it off."
As Danyeal gets the armor on he explains the plan in a quick detail to the Security Agents.
"Listen I need your weapons on stun for this, so go ahead and do it now, I am going to act as one of the terrorist and give away some info I just got about Pent and his false truths and I am going to implement him as a traitor to his own cause."
Danyeal then shakes a bit as he prepares himself for this act of a life time and the next bit of pain he is gonna feel, he takes the Ammo out of His Sub-Repeater and tosses the power pack to Esrynn.
"Alright we need this to look like a last stand for me so when I finish talking I am going to point my gun at you.." points at the Tortuga officer "Then your all going to gun me down then Esrynn is to cut the feed abruptly after I fall down "dead" and hopefully this works!."
Danyeal makes sure everyone understands and get them into place and nods as Esrynn to start camera once it is ready.
Danyeal begins the deception and begins to scream at the security forces poiting there weapons at him.
"NO I know how you found out about us......PENT BETRAYED US ALL!!!!...I Won't let my cause die in vain!!! Pent is one of the corrupted!!!! He was never a Jedi Assassin!!! He stole that Jedi Weapon from a Scientist!!!! I have know he was using that ploy since he stole it months ago!!!!"
Danyeal waves his gun around a bit as he makes his breathing heavier and more exasperated and waves his free hand towards the camera for his next rant.
"I hacked into the Weather Station Control Security Cameras and this is live to my Brothers ans Sister of the Maw, I will die here today but I can not let Pent get away with this Treachery!!!

As Sor continued to keep the shuttle close to Pent's shuttle, he noticed that Pent's shuttle began to shudder while the engine revved up for a moment. Sor figures out that Pent had tried to increase his shuttle's speed and caused damage to the shuttle.
Sor's attempts to pilot single handed cause his shuttle to bounce around a bit, making it difficult to make the shot. However, even with that, Sor's shot rings true. The bolt ripped through the terrorist's clothing, leaving a burned hole in his chest. As Pent continued to maneuver his shuttle, a tilt in the wrong direction caused the dead human to fall out of the shuttle to become street pizza below.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cole noticed that the hole that Lyle had cut into the shuttle's hull was particularly close to the shuttle's engines, making that a possible target. Taking aim, Cole's blaster bolt rang through the air, striking the engines dead on an exposed fuel line, causing a chain reaction that found it's way to the shuttle's engines themselves. (Critical hit, baby! 14 X 2 for 28 points damage)
The resultant explosion ripped the shuttle into pieces. Cole watched as several stunned people began the slow fall towards the pavement below. He also noticed that the front of the shuttle, the part that had been modified to house the missiles, was also falling, with the still intact missile towards the ground below. It was, that is, until it suddenly exploded. Neither Cole nor Sor was able to see why.
(Lyle and the others will hit the ground in 3 rounds)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(A few seconds ago)
After shutting the door behind himself, Lyle noticed several of the goons looking at him in utter surprise. One of them shouted as he looked towards the pilot's chair,
> **Terrorist wrote:**
>
> **Pent! Jedi! We got a &#8230;**

His comments were interrupted by the thunderous roar of an explosion from the back of the shuttle, where the engines were kept. The heat wave knocked the wind out of everybody in the shuttle as it was torn apart.
However, the heat was quickly dissipated as Lyle was exposed to the colder temperatures of the upper city of Coruscant, experienced via free fall. (14 points damage to Lyle; and -1 step along the condition track)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Sazaks pushes her shuttle faster and faster, she realizes that she's catching up. She lines up her shot and lets loose the volley of destructive energy. However, the shuttle explodes before her blaster bolt gets there, having been destroyed by a blaster from the other shuttle. However, the bolt was not wasted. As the shuttle barely began to fall apart, the nose of the ship suddenly burst into a blossom of explosive energy as the blaster bolt found a target after all. The nose of the ship.
The last missile was destroyed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Haden, Zeyn, and Jace heard an explosion in the distance, but could not see what caused it.
The emergency medical shuttles landed and began to see to the wounded security agents. Dankin walked over towards Zeyn and embraced the large Freorin in a crushing hug.
> **Dankin wrote:**

> You saved my life, old friend. I thank you for that. So, please understand that, per the Chancellor&#39;s orders, you cannot be publicly known to be helping us. Otherwise your cover would be blown.

Dankin slipped a pair of binder cuffs around the Freorin's hands and behind his back. Motioning towards other security agents, Dankin signaled them to do the same to Haden and Jace.
> **Dankin wrote:**
>
> Please do not resist. By the authority of the Galactic Republic, I place you under arrest for acts of terrorism. Men, place them in one of the medical shuttles. I will take them in myself.

Haden, Jace, and Zeyn all catch the message that this is a front, done only to allow the team to keep its cover.

Danyeal's vision goes blurry and then black as he hits the floor from the stun blasts. The last thing he feels, is the warmth of a furry hand on his face.

As Sor puts the shuttle in a power dive, he feels a surge of adrenaline as he deftly maneuvers the shuttle through the air and on it's side, just as the Jedi falls into the craft and lands against the other side's closed door.
Lyle, having fallen through the air for so long, does take the hit pretty hard (9 points damage). Sor pulls the shuttle out of its power dive and is now flying normally again.

"YAHAHAHAA!" Sor calms himself down from the adrenaline high, laughing quietly to himself. "How you holdin' up back there Jedi?" he asks Lyle, jokingly. He then sets the shuttle on a direct course to the Chancellor's office, wanting to check and make sure he's ok. "Well, that went well."

Sazaks found herself alone, in a viable transport, with no one immediately chasing her. The Ubese woman could care less if the foolish Jedi fell to his death, Not to mention the fact that all the other team members that even knew she was there were currently being arrested. This was the best chance she was going to get for a long time.
Slowly she guided the speeder down in a circle towards the lower levels of the city planet. She'd have to ditch the speeder, then work on removing the tracking bracelet but that shouldn't be terribly difficult. Of course she couldn't yet rule out a tracking implant as well, but that would come in time. Escape and Evade was what she needed at the moment.

Lyle to Sor: â€œI could be better, but thanks for the lift.â€
Lyle gestures to jokingly Cole:
â€œYou know Cole, the jedi order doesnâ€™t give these robes out for free.â€
After expressing his thanks Lyle takes a long deep breath, and suggests that Sor follows the falling terrorists to â€œmake sureâ€ that their either dead or arrested.

To Sor: "That was some of the best piloting I have ever seen."
Noticing the Lyle injured arm, he pulls out his medpac.

Cole's years of soldiering kick in as he begins to work on Lyle's various injuries. Stitching up the wounds isn't very pleasant for either person, but when it's said and done, Lyle isn't bleeding any more, though it'll probably be awhile still before Lyle feels like his normal self.
(Used one medpac and Lyle healed 12 points)
As Sor and the others decide on whether or not to chase the falling bodies, Sor's comlink crackles to life. An artificial voice comes over the comlink, but it's one that the Kel Dor can recognize. The voice belongs to Kari, the Chancellor's personal droid.

She is currently piloting a shuttle very similar to the one that you were given on loan from the Chancellor. I am sending you the coordinates.

Sazaks didn't bother to reply to the message, Simply raising her blaster pistol, and shooting the communications console.

As Sazaks fires her blaster into the communications console, the entire shuttle begins to shake violently. Warning klaxons began screaming throughout the cabin as damage indicators begin to flash across the holo-displays. The shaking grows steadily worse as Sazaks attempts to make a landing at a used speeder lot. However, the damage to the systems appears to be too much, and the shuttle crashes into the platform.
The crash landing bangs Sazaks up pretty badly. (6 points damage) As she stumbles out of her shuttle, she sees that a plume of smoke is drifting up into the sky. As she lines her blaster up with the anklet tracker and takes a shot, she manages to get the anklet off without hurting herself. However, as she turns to leave the depot, she hears the sounds of an emergency ambulance coming in fast. She also sees the startled look of several civilians standing around her.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sor's piloting brings his close to Sazaks's shuttle, but not quite in blaster range. From the distance, Sor notices that the shuttle begins to wobble all over the place and smoke begins to issue from the rapidly falling craft. He notices the shuttle crash land on a platform with several used speeders. He also notices the shaken Ubese come stumbling out of the shuttle and lean over her foot for a second before trying to run off.

As Koyi runs towards the Ubese, who in turn is running along the skywalk between buildings, she notices the Ubese firing randomly into the crowd, obviously intent on causing a riot and panic in the crowd.

Flipping effortlessly over the smoking husk of the air shuttle, Lyle realizes that he's about forty meters away from Sazaks. He sees the Ubese running full steam along a skywalk seperating buildings, firing into the crowd, but not hitting anyone else yet. However, all of the blaster fire has caused the crowd to panic. Lyle realizes that if Sazaks makes it to the other side of the skywalk, she'll disappear into the crowds.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After Sor lifts his shuttle into the air, he notices that there is a landing pad about half a kilometer away. It is the closest one in the area, and it is large enough to house space-worthy craft. In fact. there is one in port right now.

As Lyle charges after the Ubese, a small child running in the opposite direction runs into Lyle's path and would have been tripped over had it not been for Lyle's excellent reflexes.

Jace comes speeding up on the speeder bike he had barrowed. Having missed all the fun by the looks of things. He brings it in close to where the his fromer teammate had fallen. "I suppose she will be looking at the fun parts of Kessel for the rest of her life now." Jace looks down at the speedr bike and at his freinds starting together. "Well I guess this is it for abit. I guess I can find a way to occupy myself untill the next call. Anyone need aride anywhere?"

Koyi quickly relieves the Ubese of her weapons, a blaster pistol and a blaster rifle, before doing her best to patch up the environmental suit, and provide what medical care she can.
"She has a Gut wound, as well as one in her side." The twi'lek officer replies. Doing everything in her power to keep the Ubese alive, if only so she can stand trial.

As Koyi, Lyle, Jace, and Zeyn stand ready in case Sazaks again turns against the group, Danking goes to work on Sazaks's broken body. As he works, Sazaks begins to show signs of breathing again, though it is strained and shallow. Finally, as Sor moves through the crowd and finds the group having captured the Ubese. Danking begins to move her towards the ambulance.

"Yes, Sir," Koyi replied as she climbed onto the ambulance with Darkin and Zeyn. This hadn't exactly been a shining moment for the young twi'lek officer, but she'd managed to avoid killing the suspect if just barely. Zeyn would probably notice she'd taking the Ubese's weapons.

As the league of extraordinary men file back into their separate transports, some of their eyes may fall on a forgotten, though familiar sight; the *other* Jedi hadn't joined the hunt, instead opting to lean back against the Security Forces transport, and watch from afar.

After picking up Cole at the used speeder lot and left Sazaks at the hospital under the guard of Dankin and a few other CSF officers, the group reconvenes at the Chancellorâ€™s office. Koyi is told by Dankin to go with the others to meet the Chancellor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upon leaving the turbolift, the group is met by the face of a droid. Kari, in fact, the Chancellorâ€™s hospitality droid. [quote='Kari"]Oh, masters! You are most welcome here! Please come in. Tell me would anyone like something to drink?[/quote]
After taking the groupâ€™s orders, Kari turns and heads out the room. As she leaves, Chancellor Fyor enters the room. [quote="Fyor"]Greetings my friends! You have performed most excellently today. I must say that I was most sincerely impressed by your efforts to make Coruscant a safer place. I must congratulate you, ... in private though. If word got out that I had hired a private group to do the work of the law enforcement, Iâ€™m afraid that Iâ€™d never hear the end of it. So, Iâ€™m afraid that no one ever knew about your efforts, and most likely never will.[/quote]
With that, the Chancellor turns towards the holoprojector and presses a button. An image of one of Coruscantâ€™s news programs comes to life from the projector, showing several scenes from the past day. One shows the destruction caused by the missile at the traffic tower and how the CSF officers were responsible for the saving of many lives from terrorists who tried to take control of the tower. A few images were shown of Officer Denta shooting down Sazaks and saving many others. Finally, an image of a Bothan newscaster popped up on the holo. [quote="Newscaster"]And in a related story to todayâ€™s events, the Maw Group, which everyone will remember threatened the Chancellor after Chancellor Fyor made it the job of his administration to bring the group to justice, was dealt a severe publicity blow today by the following holo, recently acquired by this network and seen for the first time here.[/quote]
The holo shifts and shows a beleaguered terrorist in armor standing off as CSF agents break in behind him. The terrorist sounds remarkable like Danyeal. [quote="Danyeal"] NO I know how you found out about us......PENT BETRAYED US ALL!!!!...I Won't let my cause die in vain!!! Pent is one of the corrupted!!!! He was never a Jedi Assassin!!! He stole that Jedi Weapon from a Scientist!!!! I have know he was using that ploy since he stole it months ago!!!!
I hacked into the Weather Station Control Security Cameras and this is live to my Brothers ans Sister of the Maw, I will die here today but I can not let Pent get away with this Treachery!!! For true Order my Bothers and Sisters we must remove the Corrupt ones from within!!! DO NOT LET OUR DEATHS BE IN VAIN, KILL PENT AND REMOVE HIS COMMANDERS BEFORE HE DESTROYS US ALL!!!
The holo shifts back towards the newscaster and the same sighs and looks into the camera.

>
> If there was ever any doubts about Pentâ€™s claims at being a Jedi Assassin, they have now been debunked completely. Recent polls now show a higher trust of the Jedi Order and in Chancellor Fyor in particular. Without a doubt, his leadership has lead us to this great moment in history. The destruction of the Maw Group. This is Bassâ€™yk Feyleya saying, good day.

The Republic could use beings such as yourselves who are willing to put themselves on the line for the sake of others. If you are willing, then I will pay you a 1,000 credit per month retainer fee. We can also discuss payment for individual jobs as we go along. So, what do you say, are you willing to fight with me to save the Republic?

Was that true? Would she be allowed to return to the Jedi Order? Koyi had practice a breathing exercise to calm herself once again. For any who had not been selected to join the Order, to have that decision reversed was very rare, almost unheard of. She's felt lucky that she'd been accepted into the Security Force instead of being shipped off to be a farmer on Dantooine. But what this too good to be true?
"Yes, I would like to return to the Order. But I would wish to speak with Master Ralraccor, if you don't mind." Koyi replied taking the credit chip from the tray and slipping it into her pocket.

Cole listened to Koyi as he reached over and took his chip. His thoughts weighed heavily on Chancellor Fyor's offer as his fingers flipped the chip back and forth across his knuckles. While he felt that it was an honorable cause to stop the Maw from hurting others, Cole wondered what the Chancellor's intentions were once it was over. He pushed the thought out of his mind and pocketed the chip. Politics not his problem.

I have nothing that requires my attention, I would be more then willing to stick around and help out." Jace takes a seat in the Chancelors office. "So is our Traitorous friend going to be put some place uncomfortable. Or will she being seeing the more interesting parts of Kessel for the rest of her life?" Jace smiles at the fact that he was not the one that was going to be heading there. He had enuff problems. He pulls out his commlink. fliping to the channel of his contact. "Hey Bret, sorry abbout not being able to make the meeting. Got caught up in something. I will tell you about her later. I may need your services in the future so I will be in contact.

Danyeal was of course the last to arrive and was more then slightly fatigued. He hadn't gotten as much rest as he should have but at least he had fun if nothing else.
"Sorry about being late but luckily my Nurse fell asleep, with a smile I might add, but I was wondering if anyone caught that Holo-Cast just now."
Danyeal takes a seat and merrily grabs one of the Chancellors offered refreshments as well as grabbing his Credit Chip.
"I would imagine that poor fellow is sore all over, which I am." a grin shows on Danyeal's face as he sips his drink.

However, I must ask that you talk with Master Ralraccor first before anyone else in the Order. The fewer who know about this group, the more successful it will be. As to the rest of you, I do have a mission coming up in the next few days, but, in the mean time feel free to spend your credits, relax, and enjoy yourselves. If you need medical care, I will make a physician I know available. He is young, but he is very skilled. I will be contacting you as soon as Masters Landers, Denta, and Korga have spoken with Master Ralraccor and we have confirmation of our schedule.

The journey back to the Chancellor's offices was a bit more solemn than he had expected, but regardless, all in another day's work.
Haden grinned at the mention of credits, preferring to pay much more attention to Koyi's exchange with Fyor. A stipend would cover expenses, but it was hardly real credits compared to the skills a Jedi would offer. Of course, Jedi weren't mercenaries for hire, but it at least kept the Order out of the big picture. Less paperwork, more action.
Koyi's exchange was, obviously, quite juicier. What did this abruptly present CSF officer have to do with the Jedi Order? Quite the little enigma, and something to toil on during those tedious *meditation* sessions. Almost as good as meditating about that Twi'lek dancer in that cantina down by the West End.
"**I'll have to agree with Landers**," replies Haden. "**Things as they are, turns out I can't really lift a finger without the Council's authorization. Perhaps Master Ralraccor may authorize an *extended leave of absence?***"
Leaving that suggestive remark simmer, he adds, just before he's about to leave, "**And the name's K*r*og*r*a.**"

As Koyi, Haden, and Lyle walk through the temple behind the Sullustan padawan, who was either ignoring Hadenâ€™s comment or didnâ€™t hear it, they see many Jedi walking to and fro. They pass by the archives, the most complete source of information in the galaxy. They pass by the training halls where younglings are taught the basics of saber combat.
As they come to the Council Tower, they enter a turbolift and ride it up for several floors. Exiting, they almost trip over a small, green Jedi that Haden and Lyle immediately recognize as Master Yoda. The smallish Jedi was recently promoted to a position on the Jedi Council and is currently in charge of the general education of younglings and has a padawan of his own, who is not with him.
Master Yoda simply nods to the quartet as they pass each other and he enters the turbolift to descend.
Hiem motions you towards a door on this floor. After entering the door, you find yourselves in the chambers of Grand Master Ralraccor, Leader of the Jedi Council. His room is befitting a Jedi Warrior. On one wall, you several curved blades mounted for easy access. In another corner, you find a simple sleeping mat. In the center of the room, sitting on the hard durasteel floor, you find Master Ralraccor himself, sitting cross-legged in meditation.
As youâ€™ve barely entered the room, Ralraccor opens his brown eyes and looks at the group.

Koyi couldn't help but feel uncomfortable within the Jedi Temple. Here she was walking though the halls, wearing combat armor, along with with a variety of blaster weapons, when everyone around her were wearing robes, and carrying lightsabers if any weapons at all. Not to mention one of the rifles she carried had been used by Sazaks, a Jedi Hunter. Speaking of that, she made a mental note to keep tabs on the Ubese woman.
The twi'lek officer remained quiet and towards the back of the group as the were lead to where the Wookie Jedi waited for them. She took a deep breath.
"Master Ralraccor, Is what the Chancellor said true? That I'm going to be reinstated into the Jedi Order?" Koyi replied. It was the most important question she could think of.

Cole might not have realized exactly what the Ithorian meant at first, but he figured it out pretty quick as the speeder dove down at a break neck speed towards the lower levels, seeminginly ignoring the other speeders flying through the air, as well as what should be traffic laws. The taxi even flew upside down at one point, causing the non-secured Cole to land on his head and flip around a bit. Finally, the taxi came to a halt at the landing pad of Targ's Used Speeder Lot.

Haden had been listening passively to the conversation between Koyi and Ralracoor. To be honest, he wasn't quite sure who she was, or how she was related to the Order. There were over one thousand Knights present in the building at any one time, and many more Padawans - it would be naturally improbable for any one Jedi to have a working acquaintance with most.
"**Congratulations on what I suspect is your reinstatement, *Koyi*, is it?**" declares the Jedi, before adding, turning his gaze to Master Ralraccor. "**Even though I remember a time when a midichlorian count had much more sway than a commitment.**"
"**Cleaning out the scum? Interesting choice of words, and definitely not to my liking. You're speaking of sentient beings, who have genuine considerations, worries and beliefs, even if they do not align with your own. *Cleaning out the scum* only temporarily cures the symptoms, and does nothing for the underlying cause. Believe it or not, you'll end up causing much more suffering than you can currently anticipate.**"
The Jedi turns his gaze back at Ralraccor. "**I would know.**"
"**I don't like how Chancellor Fyor intends to handle the situation. Aside from the fact that he attempted to subvert the Council by directly assigning tasks to Jedi, he now seems to have a well-trained, group of armed, lawless, covert operatives at his beck and call. While one can argue that his intentions are plain, I'm not entirely convinced that, in a moment of zeal, he wouldn't overstep a line to meet his ends.**"

Haden was quite accustomed to this style of back and forth sub-textual duel of ethics - he practiced regularly with many of Masters - hardly the most clandestine of affairs. His relationship with the Grand Master, however, was more unique in that regard; any exchange of words was fated to come down to the padawan's diminished sense of respect, discipline and modesty.
"**I don't have a problem with the assignment, just the course of action,**" replies Haden. "**I think the Jedi should start an independent investigation, separate from the Chancellor's.**"
"**I think we need to find the heart of the problem. Infiltrate the organization, and break it apart from within.**"

**"I do so hope I am not interrupting."**
Anazider slowly closes the door behind him before he glides further into the chamber. He wears a bemused half-grin as he approaches the wookie grandmaster, the budding tension in the room palpable enough that it didn't require any extraordinary senses to perceive.
**"But I must say, Grandmaster Ralraccor, that when I was summoned here I did not suspect it was to be party to your being lectured by one of your own students. Although, it is said there can be found a grain of wisdom in even the most inexperienced of minds."**
He speaks with the nuanced civility of a courtier, but the look he shares with Ralraccor is both amused, and sympathetic with the wookie's enduring patience. When he is only a handful of feet from the wookie and the trio, he bows. Folding his hands within the billowing sleeves of his robes, robes far more expensive and refined of cut than most Jedi would care for, Anazider stands tall and meets the Grandmaster's gaze.
**"How can I be of service, master?"**

Cole's military training and experience with air jumps over planets did not prepare him for the sudden dive that the taxi driver went into. His eyes widened as he clutched the roof stap for dear life, watching as they darted through traffic that should killed them. " Oh frak!" Suddenly he found himself upside down with his head on the seat and legs in the air as he rolled over several times. As the cab finally landed, he opened the door and sat on the edge of the seat as he waited for the world to stop spinning. "Now I now know what shoes feel like in a dryer." Taking about ten credits, he paid the driver as he looked out the window at Targ's Used Speeder Lot. Stepping out of the taxi, Cole glances around the lot for Targ.
-10 credits from 75 cr = 65 (OOC: 75 cr is from what was left from buying equipment Checked Character Sheet to make sure.)
1000 Credit Chip + 65 = 1065 cr

Player 2 said something under his breath that sounded like a Huttese curse word and walked away from the table with what was left of his pile. Player 1 looked at his hand for a minute before matching the bet up to sixty credits total. Sor could see that Player 1 was beginning to sweat it a bit. But, two-hundred credits was nothing to sneeze at.

As the Ryn looks at Sor, the table light begins to flash, indicating that cards are about to randomize. The Ryn's smile wavers for a brief second as the signal is sent to the cards and the images begin to flash by on some of them, leaving the others alone. When it is said and done, Sor finds himself still holding the 2 of coins, the 10 of staves, but instead of the Idiot and Master of flasks, he has the Queen of Air and Darkness and the Commander of Sabers.
None the less, the call is out. The Ryn shows his hand as Sor shows his. The Ryn has a junk hand with a 2 and 3 of sabers, the Ace of flasks, and the Balance card, with a total of 9.

"What are you drinking? I'll get you another one if you need it. I get the feeling we'll be at this a while." After saying this, he makes a show of taking a small drink from his glass.

Thay probably have forgotten about it now and I pretty sure that they won't cause me any trouble now." Jace allows Nana to set down frist and then he sets across from her. He looks over at Sor to make sure his friend is doing allright. He motions for the waitress and orders Nana's drink. "I see you are doing well, and as bueatfull as ever.

As Koyi and Lyle rode the turbolift down through the temple, Lyle got off on his floor and headed towards his room to pack. Koyi continued to ride the lift down to the floor with the classrooms. As she exited and headed towards the nearest class, she noticed the younglings, ranging in age from five to twelve years old. She remembered that the families of Force sensitive children had to offer their children to the temple. The Jedi didn't recruit infants.
As she watched, she noticed the teacher, who was shorter than the shortest student. A small, green master, belonging to a race she couldn't identify, was directing the students as they practiced parrying each other's swords. It appeared that the master had paired small children with larger ones for this practice.
> **Small Green Jedi Master wrote:**
>
> Yes. Feel the Force around you as move your blade you do. Be intimidated by larger opponents you should not. Size matters not. Your ally the Force can be, if allow it you do.

As the master spoke these words, one of the larger students, a young Togorian, snickered quietly to himself. It wasn't quiet enough as the master stopped and turned towards him.
> **Master wrote:**
>
> Believe you do that size matters, youngling?

The student nodded and smiled, as he was already taller than many other species would be by full maturty. The green master smiled back.
> **Master wrote:**
>
> Very well, youngling, take your stance. Defend yourself.

The small master reached out a hand and called a training saber from the smallest student to his hand. In a flourish of movement, the master ignited his blade and leapt into the air towards the Togorian's head. The Togorian actually managed to get one block in before the small master landed on his hand and plunged his blade into the youngling's chest, causing him to convult from the stun effects. As the feline fell, the master duelist lept lightly to the ground and retuned the saber to it's owner. Then, with a raised hand, he lifted the Togorian through the Force and gently placed him on a couch in the back of the class. Turning towards the class, the master smiled.
> **Master wrote:**
>
> As said, did I, size matters not. Continue with your excersises you will.

The class promptly got back to work.
As much as Koyi probably would have enjoyed the class some more, her secure comlink she received from Kari beeped.
> **Kari wrote:**
>
> Officer Denta, would you please return to the Chancellor&#39;s office? Your next assignment has come up.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ryn and Sor played for several more minute, during which the conversation eventually lead to the Maw Group. Sor learned that the Maw Group was an organization in several parts of the galaxy, though not always very effective. It wasn't known whether or not the Maw Group was lead by a central person, or council, because it was never seen. Neither Sor nor the Ryn got the upper hand in the last few rounds of Sabacc, leaving Sor as the only winner that day.
As Sor sat at the table, his secure comlink beeped.
> **Kari wrote:**

Jace and Nana sat and talked for several minutes. Nana's life was still pretty much the same. She danced in the cantina during the rush hours and waited tables other wise. While she wasn't happy with her life, she wasn't miserable either. Jace cold tell from the way Nana looked at him that she still had some feelings for him, but she also didn't like that he left when he did. When asked about it, she metioned that she had hoped at that time, given their relationship, that he might pay off her contract to the cantina owner, a Hutt named Krillic. But, she understood that he was busy.
Busier than he realized as Jace's comlink beeped.

With a defiant nod, as opposed to a bow, Haden leaves the room.
Though he had spent more than ten years of his life at the Jedi temple, and much to his own discontent, he had accumulated little of value in his Jedi-assigned living quarters. What little he had managed to smuggle in was found, sooner or later, by pop inspections of the dormitories.
Always adapting, he had quickly learned two things. One, keep everything you cannot afford to lose upon your person. At this point of his life, this essentially applied to one thing: his lightsaber. Though considered the Jedi's last defense and first course of offense, always keeping it at hand gave him the only sense of security he couldn't afford to live without in this universe of uncertainty. It meant that no matter how far he is beaten, how powerless he felt, he always had this one last resort and course of action - fight and flight.
Two, If you can't afford to lose it, you shouldn't have it at all. Haden Krogra had known more loss than he could cope with, and his heart had hardened to it, and while an older and wiser Yoda might've recommended he teach himself to let go of that which he was afraid to lose, Haden had taken it one step further. Attachment was frivolous, unnecessary, and setting oneself up for disappointment and loss. There was only one person out there who would always look out for you, yourself, and that was the only person worth any loyalty to. Everything, and everyone else, was disposable, replaceable. Irrelevant.
As those dark thoughts slipped in and out of the young Jedi's mind, he realized that he had quietly made his way to the lower, western, levels of the Temple. Taking a moment of solace from everything around him, he watched the eternally lively planet city go out about it's business. Before he knew it, time had betrayed him once again, as the Chancellor's secure comlink beeped on his belt.
Silencing the annoyance, he looked out to the city once more. Noting the obtrusive Senate building, he winced at the subtle reminder, and made his way the nearest shuttle bay.

How much do you still owe on the place and I will help you out as much as I can." Jace pulls out the cred chip that he got from the chancellor and his own. and dumps 500 credits off of it on to his and passes the rest to Nana. "I know this is not alot but it will help. And I will give you more when I get it. " He stands and smiles and kisses her on the fore head. "Here I am also going to give you my link number so if you need anything you can contact me.

Koyi ignored the comlink, Even switching it off for the moment. Before she stepped up to the small green Jedi. Taking a deep breath to calm herself, the Twi'lek spoke.
"Greetings, Master. I'm Koyi Denta, I'm not sure if your familiar with me or not. But I've recently been reinstated into the Order by Master Ralraccor." She pauses a moment, before continuing, hoping this action wasn't seen as being selfish.

The Prince bows with a flourish as Koyi departs, an eyebrow raised in intrigue. When he stands, he offers a more respectful bow to the Grandmaster, and then only a nod to his fellow Padawan before exiting the grand chamber.
***Well, this is a little bit of interesting, to say the least. If nothing else, the Twi'lek and the padawan with the perpetual scowl should prove amusing distractions. Better than studying, in any case.***
Anazider thought to himself as he swept down the winding corridors of the Jedi Temple to his own cloister. While lavishly appointed, the apartment was decked in elegance and utility, lacking in any garish furnishings that might bring about the attentions of the Masters. With rapid facility, the Falleen nobleman began packing various odds and ends into his spacer's chest, both by the hand and through the Force, which he found most useful.
Soon, his commlink chimed, and an encrypted message buzzed through before being abruptly silenced. Anazider frowned to himself while activating the repulsor pad beneath the massive chest, and made his way out of his dormitory, intent on the Chancellor's office.

Koyi took the training lightsaber in both hands. She could tell that it was built with a Bondar Crystal, meaning it wasn't able to deal lethal damage, but that was sufficient for the twi'lek woman. "Thank you, Master Yoda. This means much to me."

Not wanting to interupt Targ from getting a sale, Cole watched from a distance. He was glad to see that the Duros seemed to be recovering from his wounds and debated on leaving the lot to find a hotel for the night. Cole didn't want to make Targ think he was looking to buy and with these prices he wouldn't be able to afford it. Besides, he wanted to get some much need supplies. He went over the list of the things in his head.
**Man, I need to get a Datapad.**
Medpacks were on the top of his list, Data Pad, Grenades...
He glanced around the city for a moment as he took in a deep breath. How many years had it been since he'd been on Coruscant? Although it had been several years he remembered it like it were yesterday. He had just turned ten when he and his father, Adin came to Coruscant on business. Adin wanted Cole to have some exposure to other cultures so that he could learn what it was like outside of the clan. It was the first time that Cole had set foot on another planet. Adin had landed his ship, the Kandosii, on one of the landing platforms and told Cole to stay with the ship till he got back. Being an obedient son, Cole did exactly what he was told. He stayed with the ship but only stepped out as far as the ship's ramp. He stepped out on the Kandosii's ramp and gazed at the wonderous city that surrounded him. Its was a sight to see for a ten year old boy and he neverforgot the impression it made on him that day. Cole glanced back at Targ for a moment.
