# [DT: Fading Light] ActII[BB]:Adventures of the Crazed Zakkeg

### **simplyscribed** (2012-06-14 16:57:36)

As the Crazed Zakkeg exits the arena, he is greeted by his “manager”, a Toydarian named Gamto.
“Good fight, good fight,” Gamto begrudges, “pity that Fever didn’t show hyuh? The boss will not be pleased by that. This mercenary shows no respect. Never mind, you win again, you a bigger deal, more will come to fight you. It’s good business. Now you can go home to yours, hyuh?”
He laughs without much genuine humour and flaps away down the tunnel to the gladiator’s preparation area.
“You be ready when we call again,” Gamto orders over his shoulder, then disappears round a corner.

---

Once inside the tunnel, Khol pulls the ridiculous “Crazed Zakkeg” mask from his head and throws it in a nearby laundry cart- one conveniently placed for such items. He hated the mask; it did little to keep the sweat out of his eyes, would get awkwardly twisted about on his face at the most inopportune of moments, and the mere sight of it always threatens to force open slowly-healing wounds...
“Make sure the creds are right ‘fore you call Gamto. I don’t want ‘nother repeat of the Simjaik fight!”
Khol calls around the corner at the Toydarian’s back, before he’s stalking away at a brisk pace. He peels off his battered combat gloves and begins to unwrap his hands as he goes, the knuckles underneath heavily calloused and bruised. In fact, thick bruises and bloody welts overlap the myriad of scars up and down his arms, but he simply ignores the wounds as a minor inconvenience as he prowls through the arena out into the shadowport. There were people that depend on him, and so much more work to do.

---

Famous as the Crazed Zakkeg, he is less well known as Khol. Without his mask, and walking with a slight stoop to hide his unusual height, he is able to leave the arena without anyone being any the wiser about who he really is.
Khol returns unhindered to his small store, which is being looked after by Garth in his absence. Garth was a young man who found himself in the arena after borrowing a loan from the wrong shark. Khol had helped set him free, and set Garth up as his apprentice. He is old enough, smart enough, and loyal enough to look after both the shop and the younger foundlings in his hero’s absence.
“”Hi boss,” Garth greets him, “did it go well? Lyra and Ti’an were worried.”
He speaks of the other two ex-slaves Khol currently cares for, two younglings: Lyra, a shy five year old female of the rabbit-like Lepi species, and Ti’an who is a rambunctious Togorian youth.

---

“Well enough Garth. Well enough. Everyone eat?”
Khol goes to inspect the youth’s latest work before setting to work on a repair job of his own. That was his way after every fight; he would see to the children and then his work, only tending to his injuries after the others had gone to bed. The focus required by the work helps to soothe him after, and the younger two needn’t see the things that he endures.
Although his hands are thick and calloused, there is a surprisingly degree gentility and deftness as they glide over a broken droid arm, securing fasteners and holding seems together while the other hand welds and glues. Khol allows himself brief contact with the Force, the touch trembling and very out of practice compared to how he used it in the ring, and from the connection he feels the presence of the three under his care; healthy, strong, and alive. This soothes him further, and he braces himself for the entrances of the younger two: Lyra would approach timidly, not wanting to interrupt, while Ti’an would be all over and scrabbling for Khol’s attention.
“Any word from... *Uncle* Jack?”
Jachelious had insisted on playing the corrupting uncle from day one, and it was all Khol could do to keep the younglings out of slicksters schemes.

---

”Jack’s been around,” Garth replied, “brought a couple games for the kids. Left a credstick for you as well. I put it in the safe.”
In a flurry of noise Lyra and Ti’an scamper through, the Lepi coming to cling on Khol’s leg and her adoptive Togrutan brother going up on his tiptoes to look at the droid arm being repaired.
“You’re back,” Lyra says, sounding relieved.
“Uncle Jack was telling us about bantha steak and bluecream sauce,” Ti’an says conversationally, “can we have it for dinner?”

---

“Bantha steaks are pretty expensive Ti’an...”
He had yet to learn Master Ruhk’s ability to bluntly reject ludicrous requests. Khol always managed to end up giving more than he should, and less than they deserved by his estimation, but that was his current lot and if he had learned anything from his former master it was to make the best with the work you had before you. Placing the droid arm delicately on the work table, Khol smooths an errant tuft of fur between Lyra’s ears as he turns bemused glance on the tiny Togrutan.
“But how ‘bout this: I’ll get Uncle Jack to bring a little bit over next time he comes by. I’m sure he won’t mind; might even get him to cook it up for you!”
If children are like sponges, then Jack was the funny-smelling bit of grease that gets absorbed, yet you can’t wring out no matter how hard you try. No matter how many lectures Khol gave the wiley old besalisk about brainwashing his three young wards, Jack would merely shrug guiltily, mumble something about an old man’s amusements, and then do same thing again the very next visit.
But this time was particularly egregious, especially with the bigger fights becoming more rare and credits becoming more scarce as a result. Khol would persuade Jack to bring the expensive steaks over on his next visit, out of the old smuggler’s own supply no less. Perhaps that would persuade the besalisk to engage in a less costly form of entertainment.

---

“Okay,” Ti’an replies, and that seems to be that. Fortunately for Khol the children have a pretty weak attention span at the best of times, although they do have an uncanny ability to suppress their rejected ideas for days or weeks before a sudden resurgence just when he thinks he’s safe.
The unusual family pass a pleasant half hour chatting about this and that. Khol shows Garth where he’s going wrong on his repair with Ti’an gets in the way and Lyra simply stays close, her need for closeness and safety provided by the proximity of the people who care for her.
Then the door chimes and things change. Garth is the first to look up at the customer, and his expression freezes. He takes Ti’an and Lyra by the arms and pulls them behind him.
The reason for his concern is a tall cloaked and masked man who stands just inside the door. His cloak is scorched and slashed in several places, and he appears to be bleeding from a wound in his side which he is applying pressure to with one hand.
“Zakkeg,” he greets without preamble, “I need to talk to you.”

---

“Garth, take Ti’an and Lyra into the other room. Be ready to gather your things, just like I showed you.”
Khol takes one look at the tall figure standing inside the door frame, and then looks beyond him into the streets for any signs of pursuit. After a moment's hesitation, the ex-padawan opens himself to the Force and scans a large radius around his shop for any evidence of surprise or ambush. Afterwards, he steps aside and allows Fever to enter, shutting and locking the door behind him.
“Sit on that bench and I’ll try to dress the wound. Who jumped you? Someone trying to fix a fight?”
Cypher discouraged interfering with the arena fighters, but due to sheer number of credits and prestige the arena produced various “accidents” and suspicious results weren’t uncommon. Khol finds his field kit, and after Fever gets situated on the bench, the ex-padawan begins to dress the wounds and listen to the other fighter’s tale.
((UtF + 13: Sense Surroundings (taking 20 (or 10) if at all possible)))
((Untrained Treat Injury +2 (taking 20 (or 10) if at all possible )))

---

Khol detects nothing that concerns him in the proximity, other than one alarming detail - Fever is radiating Force ability like heat from a raging fire.
“Nothing like that,” he replies, “but it’s time to come clean. The reason I’ve never fought you is I knew it was a fight that shouldn’t be public. Both of us would be outed. I think you know what I mean.”
Showing a surprising amount of trust considering what is being revealed about him, Fever shucks off his cloak and sits on the bench as instructed. He retains his mask for the time being.
“I need to know I can trust you, Zakkeg. There’s someone who needs your help - *if* you are what I think you are.”

---

“If you didn’t think you could trust me, you wouldn’t be here.”
Khol grunts in mild surprise when he discovers Fever’s force sensitivity. The revelation doesn’t come as too much of a shock, but it does make several disparate pieces fit into place. When Fever has taken a seat, Khol begins to bind his wound and talk as he does.
“I’ll help on one condition: if anything happens to me, you get the children off of the station safely and to somewhere better than here.”
With the wound shabbily bound, Khol goes to wash his hands and when he returns he’s wrapping his knuckles and slipping on his battered fighting gloves. After the gloves are secured, he extends a hand.
“My name is Khol by the way. What needs to be done?”
Trust extended is trust shared.

---

“Nothing, right now,” Fever replies. “I don’t know where she is anymore. Damn it’s a mess.”
Khol’s fellow gladiator reaches up to remove the mask covering his face. With it removed his features are revealed to be young and handsome, if somewhat careworn. His hair is a bright shade of red, his eyes an arresting green.
“Listen, there’s a girl on the station. I think she’s a Jedi. And she’s been asking questions about the wrong people. She’s on the run now, I hope she’s still safe, but I just have this strong feeling it’s not over.”
The young man grimaces, and covers up his concern by pretending to check his bindings.
“I hope I’m right about who you are Khol or I’ve already said too much.”

---

Khol watches Fever with a passive expression while the other man relays his story. When Fever has finished, the towering Korun responds with one of Master Ruhk’s patented disapproving grunts and a slow shake of his head.
“You’re right about who I was Fever- who we were, I understand you correctly. I’m just a strugglin’ mechanic now; one who has to get punched in the face a lot to make ends meet.”
Turning away from Fever, Khol goes to the back of the shop and takes a rusted toolbox from off a plain looking shelf. He rummages around in the toolbox until he comes up with several pieces of junk electronics... At least that is how the pieces would appear to the untrained eye; on closer examination the collection of wodgits, when properly assembled, would form the hilt of a lightsaber. Khol assembles what little he can quickly, and then stows the rest
“You didn’t agree to my terms Fever. Do that and we can get started.”

---

Fever watches Khol reassemble the shell of his lightsaber with a look of grim satisfaction.
“My name’s Veva,” he offers with a measure more of trust, “and I swear by the Code we once both lived by that if something happens to you I’ll get your family away from the shadowport. But if we succeed in helping this girl there might be a way out for all of you anyway.”
The redhead produces a datapad which he switches on with a light brush of the screen. He navigates to a page and hands it over to Khol.
“This girl is on the station. She’s Force-sensitive, maybe a Jedi. For some reason she’s been asking questions about a Kubaz named Thatrik. He’s one of my contacts, gives me information and sometimes employs me. That’s why I got the bulletin: he knows she’s investigating him and now there’s a kill order out on her as well as her friends. She’s lucky I found her first.”
Even before he looks at the image on the bounty Khol is filled with a sense of deep unease.
Momentarily he finds out what the Force is trying to tell him.
There’s no mistaking it. The girl is Adalyn.
“I didn’t have time to help her hide,” Veva says glumly, “Thatrik works indirectly for Cypher, and they’ve been digging into my business for a while now. I had people tailing me. All I could do was give her the opportunity to run before they caught up. She could be anywhere by now, but if she’s still alive we need to find her and get her away from here. Her friends too if we can. She seems too stubborn to leave without them if they’re alive.”
“On top of that Fever needs to disappear,” he adds, eyes hardening as he explains why: “Cypher’s men didn’t buy the escape story. I had to kill them.”

---

*“Why did it have to be her…”*
Khol speaks in a barely audible whisper as he stares at the datapad. There is an off-kilter rapidity to his step as he gathers the rest of his things from around the shop, and when he returns to Veva he only then realizes that he’s gripped the datapad so tightly that the screen begins to spiderweb. He offers the datapad absently as he fastens on a hooded cloak.
“She is *very* stubborn; too kriffin’ stubborn for her own good. ”
He then goes into the sleeping chamber where Garth, Ti’an, and Lyra stand huddled. Khol kneels down to speak to the children, although with his prodigious height he still towers over all three of them. Smiling, the ex-padawan’s rough-hewn features soften as he addresses the trio of orphans, and he tries to impart upon them as much confidence and calm through the Force as he can muster.
“You guys know the drill: Don’t open the door for anyone except for me or my friend Mr. Veva,” Khol jerks a thumb over his shoulder in Veva’s direction.
“If’n anyone else comes here, you leave out the secret way and go find Uncle Jack. *Always* stay together and you two listen to Garth, understood?”
Khol then pulls them in for a gentle hug. He ruffles Garth’s hair, and the hug lingers on the younger two before he’s on his feet and slowly turning away. The Korunnai is breezing past Veva and through the door before the other man has a full chance to stand.
“We need to find her quickly. For that, we need information and you need a cover. My friend Jack might be able to help us.”

---

Garth’s expression seems disbelieving, despite the drill he appears unprepared for Khol to disappear and him to be left in charge. Still, he takes to the role with surprising initiative.
“We need a call and response,” he suggests, “so I know it’s you or Mister Veva.”
“Easy enough,” replies Veva, “when someone is at the door you tell them “There is no chaos.” If they answer “there is harmony” then it proves only that they’ve studied the Jedi Code.
He grins in self-indulgence, continuing:
“Khol or myself will answer “there’s only the hell of it.” No one will guess that, huh?”
That settled, Veva moves outside. He accepts the plan to find Jack with a nod of affirmation, not having a better one.
“You know her then?” he asks curiously.

---

Khol frowns at Veva’s choice of password, but he doesn’t correct the man. He is quiet for a while before answering.
“Yes.”
The reply is blunt, but not terse. Overall, Khol’s tone is emotionless and his face a stony mask as they travel.
“You mentioned getting off the station once this is done; How did you plan to do that?”

---

Veva shrugs.
"We have to get your friend off the station somehow. You and your kids might as well be on the same ship.
Though not close to Khol's height Veva himself is taller than most men and he has no trouble matching the Korrunai's stride.
"Their own ship will be impounded by now, we can check into it but it's probably too dangerous to risk stealing it back. I may have to ask a friend for a favour."

---

“We’ll likely use every favor we have, and then some, before the day is over.”
Before long, Khol walks them through dingy back alleys and poorly-lit side streets until they stand before a dilapidated building decorated with flaking gold and platinum paint, and garishly-flashing lights. A sign over the entrance reads “PURE SABACC: Casino and Bar”.
The Pure Sabacc was Jachelious Trukser’s latest venture in a long, storied history of failed ventures, but the casino made just enough money to remain afloat and allow the cyclopean slickster to pay on his debt to Cypher. While the destitute casino area is decently well lit, the bar and dining establishment caters to the long shadows that allow for dealings to commence, of a nefarious sort.

---

”This place?” Veva asks as they enter the bar, surprised, “I know it. When you say Jack, do you mean that old besalisk?”
He approaches the bar and smiles at the twi’lek standing behind the taps.
“Mine’s a corellian ale,” he orders, then turns his head to glance at Khol. “Want anything?”

---

“Just water.”
Khol didn’t much care for alcohol. It drowned too much and provided too little. Ordering water in such an establishment would generally draw attention, and likely a bout of bullying, but Khol’s intimidating stature and dead-eyed stare tended to mute suspicions.
“Is Jack in?”

---

Veva has obviously let some of his good habits slip since the Jedi Order fell, taking the glass of corellian ale eagerly and enjoying the first sip with obvious relish.
A few of the customers nearby do sneer at Khol’s choice, but the regulars all know him well enough and don’t react. He’s a friend of the owner, he can order weird drinks if he wants.
“Yeah, he’s in his office,” the twi’lek responds, smiling prettily at Khol. She too knows him, like all the staff. “You can go on up. Does your friend have business with Jack too?”
“Sadly yes,” Veva laments, apparently able to flirt even when wounded and in fear for his life. “But I’ll happily prop up the bar another time. Shall we, pal?”

---

Khol gives the bartender a brief nod before heading to Jack’s office, waiting for Veva to enter before closing the door quietly.
Jachelious Trukser was always one for the finer things in life... Or at least as reasonable a facsimile as he could swindle. A faux Nexu fur rug drapes the dirty floor, and synthetic bantha leather furniture rests in the corner. The one-eyed besalisk sits behind a Wroshyr-wood desk that was obviously salvaged from second rate fire sale.
“Trouble Jack; need some answers.”

---

”Answers, m’boy?” Jack grumbles, looking up from his computer, “answers to what?”
The one-eyed besalisk seems pleased enough to see Khol, though his expression becomes more cagey when he sees Veva enter behind his friend.
“Who’s your tagalong?”

---

“The guy that wouldn’t fight me.”
As Khol sits on a nearby stack of boxes, they groan familiarly under his weight. He affixes Jack with a frown that is meant to stall any further questions until he speaks his peace.
“Word is Thatrik is after a girl- a girl I know. We need to get to her first, then you, me, her, this guy, and the kids are making a run for it. What’ve you heard?”
Never a very eloquent speaker, the years since his separation have found Khol returning to a more coarse dialect. One born of shady dealings, and desperate situations. But a certain richness rounds out his speech, likely owing to his time with the Jedi. It is much like unsculpted marble; the value is there, if not the refinement.

---

”A run for it?”
The Besalisk straightens and his chest puffs out in alarm. He holds out all four arms, palms outward.
“Okay okay, let’s not be hasty m’boy. We’ll get to why you want me to up sticks when I’ve got a good thing going later. This girl you know, I assume she’s the one with the bounty on her head.”
Harrumphing, he reaches with his upper right hand to touch his screen, flicking through windows until he pulls up the bounty notice.
“This girl?” he asks, turning the screen so that Khol and Veva can see.

---

“That’s her.”
Khol drums his fingers on the top of his knee, his chin couched in his other hand while he contemplates.
“She’s a... *friend* of mine- from before I met you. I’m gonna’ get her out of this, and likely ‘cause of that we’re going to have to get out of here.”
As his fingers stop drumming, the Korunnai’s face turns grim. He locks Ol’ Jack with a direct look, his words weighing heavy with import.
“They’re gonna’ kill me Jack. It may not be today, or next week, or six months from now, but there’s gonna’ be a fight I can’t handle, or somethin’ they want me to do but I won’t, and they’ll burn me down for it. Then they’ll use you until the same happens, and take the kids. It’s the nature of this business; of who they are.”
At this Khol stands up and begins to pace as he orders his thoughts. Always before the ex-padawan had moved at Jack’s direction, except in instances of morality, but this time it seems Khol is intent on leading the way and he won’t be dissuaded.
“We ain’t like them Jack. We’re past time when we should’ve left, and now here’s our chance. I’ve gotta do this, and even though you’re the biggest liar, cheater, and schemer I’ve ever met, you’re also a good man and a friend, and I’m not leaving you behind even if I have to punch you to sleep and carry you.”

---

“Khol m’boy, this girlfriend of yours is big trouble,” sighs the besalisk, shaking his head sadly, “I don’t think this is the right time to leave. Too dangerous by far. But you’re not going to let it go, are you?”
Sitting back in his chair, Jack folds his lower arms and steeples the index fingers of his upper hands. A familiar gesture to Khol, it indicates the old rogue is scheming, working out the odds. If the Korunnai knows him as well as he thinks he does, then it is also an indicator that despite his reservations he’ll help.
Jack’s good eye closes for a moment, then opens to focus on Veva.
“This is Fever, huh? How does he factor in. You do know he works for Thatrik, m’boy?”

---

“I do, but he ended up saving the girl and had to kill some of Thatrik’s men in the process. We need for “Fever” to disappear; “Crazed Zakkeg” too for that matter. Whatcha have in mind?”
Khol’s regained his seat, and he turns to Veva to include the other man in the conversation. He realizes that he’s taken a long chance on this stranger in so short an amount of time, but has been paranoid and guarded ever since the massacre on New Holstice. The Korunnai didn’t like the way that felt, the way it fed into his rage at times. It was about time for a change.

---

Veva steps forward to take the other of the two seats in front of Jack’s desk while the Besalisk ponders the problem.
“Disappear the two of you, rescue the damsel in distress, and smuggle a half-dozen people off world without Cypher stopping us. Tall order, m’boy, even for you and I.”
“And I. Besides nothing’s impossible if you have the will,” Veva comments, “I suggest we plan this one step at a time. Finding the girl comes first.”
“I don’t know about the girl, but her friends? We might have better luck,” Jack ponders, reaching out to his screen and swiping the window of Adalyn’s bounty to one side, replacing it with another bounty notice. On this one is a picture of a young twi’lek woman. He shows a third notice, with an image of a verpine.
“The way I hear it the twi’lek was taken at the arena. Thatrik’s people have her now. It would be dangerous to free her, but at least we know where she is.”
“And the verpine?”
“I don’t know about the verpine. But we can put some feelers out.”

---

“Do so. If they don’t move’m to a central location, might have to split up to and save both. If she is still the same person I know,” Khol indicates Jack’s screen, “She won’t leave them behind. We get to them, we’ll get her.”
“What are our prospects for getting away? We can take care of the physical stuff, but it won’t mean sithspit if we can’t escape.”

---

“Well, since Cypher has my ship,” Jack says bitterly, “we’re not getting away that way. We’ll have to charter a transport, and that has its own problems. We have to leave before Cypher finds out. There aren’t many pilots around here I’d trust.”
He pauses to think, then corrects himself.
“There aren’t any pilots around here I’d trust.”
“I might be able to help,” Veva chimes in, “I have a few friends who frequent the port. That’s how I usually come and go when I’m not on a job. I can check to see if any are around.”
”Fine, then check into that. But all we’ve got so far is a whole lot of maybe. It’s looking dicey.”

---

“Maybe is about as good as we’re going to get, I’m ‘fraid. But a very wise man always told me to take what’s given, and leave the rest. We make it work with what we have, or it won’t work.”
Khol stands up again, but this time he stretches the muscles in his back and rolls his shoulders as if preparing for a fight. He checks the straps on his fighting gloves one last time before nodding to himself.
“Where’d they take the twi’lek? I want to check it out before we make a move. Let us know whatever you find about the verpine,” Khol nods to Jachelious, then Veva, “And about the transport situation. Jack, you have a scrambled comm channel we can use?”

---

“If I know Thatrik half as well as I think I do he wouldn’t have his men take her to his home,” Veva muses, “or to any of his businesses. That leaves us with any property he owns that is currently disused.”
Jack nods ponderously.
“That rings true, and it just so happens one of his business concerns went under last week. A little mechanic shop whose owner just crumbled under the pressure.”
The besalisk shoots Khol a shark-like grin. Apparently he has been looking out for Khol in his own way.
“I can check into other possible locations but I suggest you start there while I get the ball rolling.”
The old crook opens a drawer in his desk and takes out a couple of comm scramblers.
“You can use these. They’re keyed to each other already. Those units and my computer are the only things that’ll pick up the message.”

---

Khol grunts by way of response to Jack’s “business dealings”, but he doesn’t question him any further as he takes the comm scrambler. Clearing a space on Jack’s desk, without the slickster’s permission, Khol pulls out the various pieces to his lightsaber and lays them out in a specific order.
“It’s gonna take me some time to piece this back together, then I’ll make for the mechanics shop. Keep an eye out, and stay in touch.”

---

“One last thing,” rumbles Jack, “you two want to disappear? Then let’s hide you. How about we put you in armour like mercenaries. No one will know who’s behind the helmet.”
Veva grimaces at the idea of being confined in an armoured suit, but nods reluctant agreement.
“Beats surgery I suppose,” he acknowledges, “but where are we going to get it?”
“Just so happens I had a shipment of arms and armour not so long ago,” the besalisk replies with a toothy grin, “they fell off the back of a space transport.”
Laughing at his own joke, the one-eyed old scoundrel turns said eye on Veva. He then taps a button on his screen, opening up a comm channel with the bar downstairs.
“Alini, get someone to cover the bar and come up here.”
Soon enough the twi’lek bartender enters the office, glancing around at the trio inquisitively.
“Congratulations Alini, your shift just ended early. But I have some other business for you - I want you to take this fellow to see the latest shipment and let him pick out what he wants. Then your time is your own.”
“You got it, Jack,” she responds enthusiastically, glad of the surprise reprieve from her work. Her regular work at any rate - clearly she has a larger part in Jack’s operation than merely serving drinks.
Turning her smile on Veva, Alini beckons with a finger.
“Come along then Red,” she urges, “the quicker we do this the quicker I can clock off.”
“Sure,” Veva replies, getting to his feet, ”lead the way.”
He leans over Jack’s desk to retrieve the second comm scrambler, then follows the twi’lek girl out of the office.
Jack sits in quiet contemplation for a few moments after they’ve gone, then pushes himself out of his chair.
“This is bad business, m’boy. Far too many things to go wrong. Like that one - I’m not sure we can rely on him.”
The besalisk shakes his head grimly.
“I’d better start making enquiries,” he states, going out the door, ”lock up when you leave.”

---

When he has everything properly arranged, and is certain that there is no one else within spying distance, Khol sets to reconstructing the delicate weapon. His hands fly over the lightsaber with a surprisingly agility and deftness, and he goes about his work with reverent care.
Little over half an hour passes before Khol completes his work. Small beads of sweat glisten along his shaved scalp, so intense is his concentration. He glances around the shabby office to make sure that he was sufficiently obscured from view, then taking a deep breath he ignites the lightsaber.
The blade snap-hisses to life, and Khol merely stares at the weapon for a long moment as cerulean light washes skittering shadows around the office. It felt... *heavier* for some reason, as if his hands no longer remembered its balance. Certain that he reassembled the lightsaber correctly, Khol merely shakes his head, extinguishes the sword and then carefully hides it on his person.
Once out into the casino again, Khol looks for Alini, or wherever Ol’ Jack may have hidden his armored disguise. After retrieving the armor, he makes for the abandoned mechanic’s shop.

---

Alini is indeed waiting downstairs. The sight of her seems incongruous, sitting as she is in the wrong side of the bar with an electric pink cocktail in her hand. On the floor beside her is a large case.
She looks up as Khol exits the manager’s office and descends the stairs. She appears a bit miffed.
“Not only did your friend turn me down when I asked him to join me for a drink, he insisted I bring this back here for you,” she complains, “which I only did because whatever’s going on it must be important for Jack to let him take whatever he wanted from storage. And naturally he took the best.”
Alini kicks the metal case next to her which clangs dully.
“This one’s yours. Whatever you guys are up to it must be important, right? But a girl doesn’t like being turned down. Tell your friend if he changes his mind he better be prepared to buy me a lot of drinks.”
Khol finds a place to change into his disguise and discovers that far from the cheap armour he’d been expecting the suit in the case proves to be a pretty swish piece of tech.
The suit is comprised of black plasteel plates that provide near-full body coverage. It is so uniform and sleek he can’t work out how he’s meant to see out of the helmet until he tries it on and realises it makes use of an advanced digital optics interface. It isn’t even that hard to move in - while it is obviously heavier than no armour at all, the burden of it is lightened by a powered frame. To Khol’s experienced eye the suit shouldn’t be considered a Heavy-class armour, but it comes close, a very high-end Medium-class capable of withstanding most kinds of attack. Coupled with the powered frame making it easier to wear than even lighter armours and it is hard not to be impressed.
He has to wonder if Jack actually knew exactly what he had in that shipment.
The armour is a pretty close fit. It is obviously designed with a larger man in mind, and the plates are attached to a stretchy interior mesh-weave that allows for some flexibility. Khol finds he is comfortable enough.
Once he is changed into the armour and prepared to go seek out Thatrik’s closed mechanics shop, Khol realises he isn’t actually sure where it is. A quick comm call to Jack corrects the error, and Veva chimes in on the conversation to say he’ll meet the other Jedi there as soon as he can.
The Korunnai reaches his destination to find that the shop isn’t as abandoned as it should be. Sure, metal shutters are pulled down over the window and door, but his keen senses tell him that there are lifeforms within. And, he notes, two sentients keeping watch. One on the roof of the mechanics store itself, and one on the roof opposite.
Veva has yet to arrive. Could be tricky to pull off on his own. Not impossible. But tricky.

“I’m sure he’s just focused Alini. I’ll put in a good word for you.”
Earnest to a fault, Khol actually seems rather genuine in sending Veva the young twi’lek’s regards. With a nod, the Korunnai leaves her at the bar to find a safe spot to don the armor, and once fully armed and armored he makes his way to the designated location.
***
Khol hunkers down just out of sight of the mechanics shop, his breath sounding loud in his ears due to the all-encompassing closeness of the helmet. The guard detail was expected; one did not get far in shadier corners of the galaxy without taking proper precautions.
*Effectiveness Khol. Doesn’t matter how fast, or how hard, so long as you hit when you need to.*
Master Ruhk’s calming baritone comes filtering through his thoughts, as it always had when Khol confronted a difficult situation. But ever since that day, the voice grew more faint, and he heard it less and less...
Reaching out through the Force, Khol scans the entirety of the building in an attempt gauge the emotions of the guards and those within. Master Ruhk wasn’t here, and Adalyn was in trouble; if he found someone in distress in the building, he would have to make a move.
((Sense the Force (and/or Search Your Feelings, I’m not picky): UTF +13 - RESULT 31 (Sense the Force), 28 (Sense Surroundings), 28 (Search Your Feelings)))

---

Khol can feel four people present within the mechanics store, though he cannot get more of a read. There is certainly no disturbance in the Force that might indicate any of them are under extreme pain or stress. Yet his feelings tell him that this is the right place, that one of them is likely the prisoner, and that waiting to act might just allow the situation to get more difficult.

---

*Nothing worth doing is ever easy.*
Sometimes Khol wondered if master Ruhk were less a great warrior, and more an incredible prophet. Using the armor’s built in nightvision, Khol scans the alleys surrounding for anything that would help him set his rescue attempt into motion. When the Korunnai’s gaze sweeps over a collection of alcohol bottles, pieces of a plan begin to fall into place and he positions himself to make a run at the building.
Khol raises a hand, and one of the thicker liquor bottles lifts from the ground and tumbles end-over-end in through the air in a lazily thrown arc. The ex-padawan attempts to make flight of the bottle look as if it were thrown from the opposing roof, using the shadows and poor visibility to hide its true trajectory. Trusting in the innate stupidity of street thugs, Khol makes a break for the building, sticking to the shadows, when he deems the two guards sufficiently distracted.

“Hoi you splekking pile of pindu-squik, what do you think you’re doing? And what is this? You drinking over there?!”
“I ain’t drinking. Must be yours. Hey, are you drinking!? Am I the only one actually doing his job over here. Screw you!”
As the argument escalates, Khol rushes out into the street, moving from cover to cover as fast and quietly as he can. Even he realises he isn’t exactly doing a good job of achieving silence though.
He suddenly feels very strongly that he should find cover and rolls behind a large trash bin about halfway from his destination.
“Hey hey shut it! Did you hear something?”
“I dunno, hard to hear over your yapping.”
“Just have a look, damn it.”
At this rather inopportune moment, Khol realises that the scrambled commlink is vibrating to indicate an incoming call.

---

Cursing quietly to himself, Khol hunkers down behind the refuse bin as much as his massive, noisy frame will allow. He needed them close enough to silence, or arguing loudly enough for him to slip by, and the pair of goons seemed inclined to do neither. What the Korunnai needed was something a little more aggressive...
Ignoring the incoming buzz for the time being, Khol summons the Force and uses it to loudly slam the lid of the garbage container he’s hiding behind. He adds a bit of rustling to the effect, to simulate someone or something perhaps digging through the trash, and then he hunkers down again to hide. If any of the guards come to investigate, the Korunnai pounces from hiding like a Corellian Sand Panther, striking as viciously and quietly as he can manage.

---

The guards fall conspicuously silent, slightly more (if belatedly) professional once they realise there is actually something going on underneath them. Khol’s Force senses tell him that the one on the mechanic’s roof is staying put but the second is rising to the bait. Minutes later a lightly armoured man with a shaved head emerges from an alley and advances up the street to the bin, blaster rifle lifted before him.
“Whoever’s in there, come out where I can see you,” he demands of the supposed occupant of the bin. Chagrined by the lack of response he moves a few steps closer.
After making similar demands several times he goes right up to it and points his gun inside.
“What the? Nothing here Rikk... Okay, I’ll check nearby. You still got line of sight on me? Good. I am not a damn pansy! Frak you.”
That’s when he passes the corner of the bin and Khol’s hand lashes out and grabs his wrist, dragging him down behind the bin and out of sight and smashing the man’s head against the ground to quickly silence him.
Faintly from the man’s commlink he hears Rikk’s voice.
“Dal, Dal, come in. What the hell just happened? Oh hell.”

---

Khol quickly snatches up the downed man’s commlink, and in a rough approximation of the voice he heard moments before the Korunnai speaks as though he were injured.
“Hurt bad... He’s gettin’ away...”
To aid the subterfuge, Khol uses the Force to rattle trash and upend a small refuse bin to mimic a ragged escape. He then takes the enemy commlink with him as he moves into position to break into the mechanics shop the moment he hears of the goon’s pursuit.

---

Khol's mimicry is okay considering his lack of talent and the pressure of the situation. It's nowhere close to perfect but seems to get the job done.
His performance doesn't quite get the reaction he expected though.
"Dal is down," he hears from his commlink, and sees that it is now receiving on a different pre-programmed channel to the one Dal and Rikk had been using. "I repeat, Dal is down. We have a hostile! I'll investigate."
"Hold your position," a raspy voice replies, "lock down the roof. No one gets in that way."
"Got it."
As he presses up against the shutter in the shadow of the doorway, Khol's extended senses tell him that all but three of the four sentients inside are moving position, presumably to more defensible locations where they can cover the entrance.

---

Khol frowns darkly as his plan goes slightly awry. Muting the enemy commlink, he makes sure no one is within earshot before tapping into the armor’s internal commlink.
“Khol here.”
While the message comes through, Khol stalks around the building looking for any hand holds he can find that would allow him access to the rooftop. When he finds a suitable place on the building, Khol begins to scale the side as quietly as he can manage, with an eye towards the lookout up top. The ex-padawan prepares another distraction via the Force, so that he may charge the goon from behind.

((Stealth (untrained) + 3))

---

“Finally. It’s Fever. Listen, I think I found your girl. I’m on her trail now. Can you handle your end alone?”
With surprising deftness Khol reaches the roof without alerting its sole occupant, who is patrolling slowly around the outside edge. Looking down into the alley below him the Korunnai sees some loose trash, and uses the Force to fling it out of the alley and into a wall across the street.
The guard immediately crosses to see what made the noise, giving Khol his opportunity to make the rooftop without being attacked.
Finding nothing, the guard turns only to find two point eleven metres of muscular Korrunai almost on top of him.

---

Khol descends upon the guard like a swooping hawkbat, lancing a series of knife-handed jabs into the man’s midsection, chest, and neck that are meant to prevent him from using his commlink while simultaneously dropping him to the rooftop. After the strikes land, Khol catches the guard and eases him to the rooftop so as to prevent the man from falling over the side. Once the guard is taken care of, Khol answers flips open the comm channel.
“I’ll be fine, she is the priority. Get her to safety and I will join-up soon.”
Standing over the trapdoor leading into the mechanic’s shop, Khol closes his eyes and begins to draw deeply on the Force. Haunting memories of a desperate escape on a far-off world bubble up to the surface of his thoughts unbidden, but he banishes them and focuses on the task at hand.
When the Korun opens his eyes, the world is awash in crimson threads, interconnected, knotted, and pulsating. Staring down at the trapdoor, Khol looks for a nexus of lines where he can apply the proper amount of force to cause the whole thing to come crashing down.
A Shatterpoint.
Khol locks his gaze onto the Shatterpoint, and with a snarling fury he hammers his fist down.
((Attack on the Goon + 10 = 1d6+8 + (Lower damage threshold by 10 because of Devastating Attack and Teras Kasi training)))
((Shatterpoint on the Door: (Taking 20 if applicable) UtF + 13 + (Going to use a FP to ignore the DR of the door/hinge)))
((Attack the Door + 3 (7 pts of Power Attack) = 1d6+15 damage to the door (Lower damage threshold by 10 because of Devastating Attack and Teras Kasi training)))

---

Khol busts right through the door, the metal splintering into dozens of slivers that clang down the stairs beyond. At the bottom of the stairs, a thug who was kneeling behind a crate pointing his rifle at the main door turns and gapes as Khol comes down the stairs. He manages to fire on the Korunnai, the blaster bolts striking true but deflecting off the Jedi’s black armour, scorching the plates.
Another man and a Trandoshan break cover from behind a worktable long enough to snap off some shots at him, but both go wide. He can’t see the prisoner yet, but there is a whole corner of the room on his immediate right that he won’t be able to see until he has reached the bottom of the stairs.
((OOC: 14 hp damage))

---

Khol ignores the pain- ignores it less he channel it into a rage. Leaping from the stairwell, Khol angles both of his knees to catch the man at the bottom directly in the chest with the full force of the Korunnai’s weight behind the blow.
Using the man to cushion his blow, Khol rolls to a skidding stop behind the crate and uses the container for cove. Khol then stretches out with his senses to track the movements of the two remaining thugs.
((Move: Leap off of the stairway))
((Standard: Attack goon at bottom of stairway + 10 for 1d6+8))
((Swift: Sense Surroundings - UtF +13))

---

The man folds up as Khol’s knees plough into his chest, his body snapping backwards against the crate with a crunch. After the collision he slips to the floor, unconscious.
Crouching low, Khol closes his eyes as he relies on the Force to show him where his other foes are. The human is moving into the blind zone to his right, where a third person is also present - though this person is sitting upright and unmoving on a chair.
The Trando is fumbling with the bandolier strapped across his chest, his clawed hands coming away with a small cylindrical object. When he moves as though to throw it, the object’s purpose is clear. *Grenade!*
The explosive clatters to the ground near the crate, then rolls backwards, mercifully putting the box directly between it and Khol. It beeps several times then explodes with intense heat and pressure, the flames spilling around the Korunnai’s cover to lick at his armour and forcing him back against the stairs.Several smaller explosions sound from the mechanics shops as various devices undergoing repair are consumed by the conflagration.
“IDIOT!” the man shouts at his Trandoshan companion, then: “...did it kill him?”
((OOC: area attack misses, but deals 7 dmg))

---

Khol grits his teeth and bears down as bits of shrapnel and flame impact his armor and threaten to send him sprawling. More memories drift to the surface of his thoughts; memories of explosions and turbolaser fire on far away worlds. Of clone troopers dying in the battlefield, and the final push to seize the day...
With a roar, Khol rolls from behind the crate charges into the larger area of the mechanics shop to his right, and as he does so he swings a hand towards the central lighting as if throwing something. Calling upon the Force, the former padawan causes the light to burst, showering the area in a brief cascade of sparks before casting it into darkness and flickering shadows along the edges.
Bounding over obstacles, Khol runs at the human head-on, but just before they collide Khol leaps into the air and lashes out with a jumping spin kick meant to catch the man around the throat and send him somersaulting bottom-over-top.
((Move: Move into the blindspot area to the right after the goon))
((Swift: Move Light Object to disable light(s): UtF +13))
((Attack: Combat Gloves + 10 for 1d6+8 damage))

---

”Oh hell no,” the man groans at the light bursts. He turns to face the stairs just as Khol leaps toward him. Surprisingly, the man reacts to the foot coming at his throat despite the darkness, He bobs to one side, right arm coming up to deflect the kick away. His left hand lashes out wielding a vibroknife, nicking the body sheath through a join between the armoured plates at Khol’s elbow.
“You’re messing with the wrong man, whoever you are.”
The Trando breaks cover, his rifle raised. Red light paints the scene momentarily before it splashes on the Korunnai’s armour and dissipates. Growling, the alien throws down the rifle and leaps the worktable in front of him in his hurry to reach the melee.
((OOC: Khol takes 11 hp damage from the vibroknife; 12 from the blaster rifle.))

---

Khol spins away from the knife, yet when he regains his posture, blood is dripping from between a seal in the borrowed armor. He spares a moment to think of Jack’s grumbling over damaging good merchandise, before he shakes the thought away and focuses. With focus, the pain ebbs away, as does the the sweat stinging his eyes, and even the sound of his own heavy breathing until there is nothing left but him and his two targets, all interconnected points of light.
The Korunnai launches himself at the human, moving with the unstoppable force of an avalanche. He feints high, then sweeps in with a powerful kick to the legs, following that with overhand punch meant to drive the man into the ground. The longer the battle lasts, the more wild and dangerous Khol becomes, and the closer the darkness creeps...
((Attack: Combat Gloves + 7 (+1d6 for FP use) for 1d6+12 (3 pts of power attack used) damage))

---

The human cries out as he’s swept from his feet and pounded into the ground, cracking his head against the floor. He is still moving, albeit woozily, but before Khol can finish the job the Trandoshan is on him, swinging his powerful arms. Khol blocks instinctively and jumps in time to avoid an impulsive kick from the downed man, landing a short distance away and earning a momentary reprieve. It is then that moment he sees the room’s third occupant thanks to the infrared aid of his visor: a twi’lek woman gagged bound to a chair that is set behind the shop counter. She throws all her weight to her right, toppling her chair in a desperate attempt to escape during the chaos.

---

*Never leave work half-done.*
It was Master Ruhk’s voice again. Rather than shunting the advice aside this time, Khol makes use of it as he sprints at the battered human. Pivoting just before reaching the man, the ex-padawan rotates into a spinning thrust kick meant to send the poor human flying. He then turns just in time to set himself into a defensive posture against the Trandoshan.
((Attack: Combat Gloves + 7 (+1d6 for FP use) for 1d6+12 (3 pts of power attack used) damage))

---

Khol’s vicious finishing attack on the prone man throws him bodily into the nearby counter with a loud thud, the vibrations of the impact knocking several tools off the countertop with a series of clangs and crashes. This time, it’s pretty certain he’s staying down.
He turns in time to be battered around the head by his Trandoshan opponent, the impact ringing his skull.
Though out of sight behind the counter, it becomes obvious the prisoner has managed to spit out her gag when she shouts out some guidance:
“Don’t let him touch your skin, his claws are tipped with poison!”
((OOC: 7 damage))

---

“Did they do anything to you? Can you stand?”
Khol’s voice is even and his breathing steady, although the sum total of his injuries are beginning to wear at him. He takes the twi’lek’s advice, and slowly begins to edge around the Trandoshan, looking for an opening.
In a flash, the Korunnai is on the mercenary, a whirlwind of punches, elbows, and knee strikes. Trandoshans are well known for their resilient hides and ability to regenerate, but Khol seems intent on battering past that through sheer force of strength. After a series of spear-handed jabs, Khol follows with a vicious uppercut meant to rock the reptile back onto its heels.
((Attack: Combat Gloves + 7 for 1d6+12 (3 pts of power attack used) damage (4pts of damage even on a miss)))

---

“Not unless I can free myself,” Alaris replies, “don’t worry about me though.”
The Trandoshan is nowhere near agile enough to avoid Khol’s rapid-fire attacks, though he is plenty tough enough to weather them. Even after the final blow he grins wide, wicked teeth showing, and launches a return assault in the form of a brutal blow to his chest. The armour plating Khol wears absorbs most of the impact, but he is knocked back. As he staggers, a second swipe catches him in the face.
((OOC: Khol takes another 6 damage.))

---

The claw swipe across the face sends sparks and chips of armor flying, causing Khol to grit his teeth against the blow. Rage suddenly flares in the ex-padawan, red-hot, and it takes all of his concentration to tamp it back down. With barely a thought, Khol flies at the Trandoshan again, but this time in a wild staccato of blows. Punches, kicks, knees, and elbow strikes launch in a fury, meant to where the Trandoshan down through sheer brutal attrition as Khol slowly begins to lose his grip on restraint...
((Attack: Combat Gloves + 7 for 1d6+12 (3 pts of power attack used) damage (4pts of damage even on a miss)))

---

The Trandoshan reels back under the onslaught, head slamming back under the force of one particular blow. He grins wickedly, spits out some blood and a tooth, then leaps at Khol, arms spread wide. The young Jedi spins and kicks high, connecting with the mercenary’s collarbone with a crunch. The Trando falls, dead weight on top of Khol’s legs.
“You okay?” Alaris asks from down below the counter, “only I could use a little help.”

---

Khol stands a few moments breathing in ragged gulps of air as the thug falls unconscious at his feet. With one hand, the Korunnai slings the Trandoshan to the side before rounding the bar to see to Alaris.
“I’ll live. Can you run?”
Wasting no time, Khol pulls a cutting tool from his utility belt and slices the twi’lek free. He then quickly, yet gently, gathers her to her feet and looks around with force-granted sight for any sign of forces gathering outside of the building.
((Swift: Sense Surroundings - UtF +13))

---

The Twi’lek is bruised and dried blood crust the corner of her lips, but otherwise looks fine - other than being bound in unbreakable restraints. They are short work for Khol’s specialised tool, however, and soon Alaris is free and on her feet.
“I’m fine,” she tells him, adding: “not that I’m ungrateful but I don’t know who you are or why you came for me.”
It has only been a few minutes since Khol started staging his extraction, and so far there is no evidence of malevolent forces gathering outside. It would be best not to push his luck with an extended stay, though.

---

“I’m a... friend of Adalyn’s. She’s in trouble I help her; you’re with her, so I help you.”
Khol quickly leads Alaris back through the rooftop entrance and down the side of the building, helping her whenever she needs along the way. When they’ve made it a safe enough distance away from the mechanic’s shop, Khol hands the twi’lek the enemy commlink and then switches the armor’s internal unit to the scrambled channel.
“My end is done- haeding for the rendeazvous. Status?”

---

“I lost your girl, my friend, but I’ll get back on her trail. Listen up - get your family and find the *Second Smile*, Captain Benla is an old friend of mine. I’ll contact you when I’ve got the girl.”
”You’re him,” Alaris says, reaching out to touch Khol’s arm. The Rutian Twi’lek’s expression is equal parts disbelieving, awed, and bemused.
“I could tell she hoped it might be you, but the odds against it... And yet, it’s the only thing that makes sense. We were Adalyn’s only friends on this station. We thought.”
She pauses.
“You’re *Khol*.”

---

“On the way to my shop now, signal if you need help.”
Khol closes the comm channel and continues running, although he halts for a moment when Alaris identifies him. After a few seconds hesitation, Khol nods in the affirmative to the twi’lek before he resumes running. He takes the back alleys that leads to his shop, talking at moments when he feels the area is secure enough.
“I am Khol. Since she is alive, you likely have somewhere safe and hidden outside of here. Somewhere you should’ve *stayed*.”
The word comes out more forcefully than Khol intends, but the combination of his injuries and the whirlwind of emotions Adalyn always causes in him, has the Korunnai in little mood for niceties. Conflicting with those emotions is his suddenly desperate need to get to his shop and secure his little family, before anything else goes awry.

---

”Listen pal, you’re the only reason we even came to this dump,” Alaris retorts, somewhat incensed by his attitude. She takes advantage of their short rest break to lecture him.
“We’re happy to keep ourselves to ourselves unless we see an opportunity to help a Jedi or ally escape through our network, but we couldn’t ignore what you’re doing. You think guerilla attacks are going to help anyone? The Empire loses some resources, but it gains political capital. It reminds people of the lies: that the Jedi are monsters. The radicals like you are just throwing fuel on the fire, and it’s making it harder and harder for the rest of us. Once we found out out you were based here, of course we had to come. To talk you into wising up.”
Of course, this makes little sense to Khol. *He* hasn’t been fighting a one-man guerilla war against the Empire.

---

Khol is left speechless. He attempts a few spluttering rebuttals, but all he can manage is to shake his head sadly.
“That ain’t me; I’ve been workin’ here as a mechanic and a fighter in the pits. You came lookin’ for someone else, thinkin’ it was me, and just so happened to get me by mistake.”
When they are a few block away from the Korunnai’s shop, Khol takes a moment to remove the armor and stow it away. He then proceeds to the building, and takes a moment to search its exterior, both visually and through the Force. If all is clear, he gives a knock at the door and waits for Garth to respond. In the meantime, he speaks to Alalris over his shoulder.
“Networks and radicals... Judgin’ by the blood on your lip and the mess you and Adalyn have caused here, you should’ve done what I said and stayed where you were. Where it was safe.”

---

”Hey, I don’t much like it here, but I don’t like your tone either. Exactly how many lives have you saved working as a mechanic and fighting in the pits? Adalyn, Kikrin and I have protected a lot of people. People who were worth saving. If I’d died here I’d have died knowing I did some good and that’s worth something. If you were a Jedi, you used to believe in things like that. What changed? ”
As far as Khol can tell, there’s nothing untoward going on at his shop, so he feels safe in knocking at the door.
He senses Garth moving on the other side of the door, then his ward speaks before the Korunnai gets a chance to reply to Alaris:
“There is no chaos.”

---

“...There’s only the hell of it.”
Khol waits for Garth to open the door, ignoring Alaris in the process. Once inside, he calls for all three of the children. When Garth, Lyra, and Ti’an have gathered around him, he looks them each in the eye and speaks directly, although with tenderness.
“We have to leave now. You should already have all your things ready, but take one last look around to make sure you’re not leaving anything, ‘cause we’re not comin’ back. Move quickly; we don’t have much time.”
When the children are off on their separate tasks, Khol takes one last wistful look around his store before he too starts gathering his things.
“We fought system to system in the Clone Wars, savin’ people worth savin’. They rewarded us by slaughterin’ the temple and callin’ us traitors. We called ourselves fightin’ back the darkness, full of pride and never watchin’ the shadows we made behind us.”
He takes a quick moment to pull a hidden credit chest from behind a pile of scrap droids, and after looking over the paltry sum inside he shakes his head and pockets the credits. Khol then turns to lean against a counter as he continues speaking to Alaris.
“Friend of mine ran afoul of Cypher; I fought in the pits to save his life. I saved these kids from slavery, and several others, because,” at this Khol crosses his arms over his chest, making sure Alaris sees the very prominent scars criss-crossing them.
“I know what it means to be under the vibro-whip. I’ve done what I can for those in *real* need here. I die here, they spend the rest of their lives suffering ‘cause I failed. I keep livin’- keep fightin’, then one day I’ll see them to somewhere they can grow proper. That’s worth more than your “Martyr’s Illusion”, as Master Ruhk use to call it, any day.”

---

Alaris gazes around the shop, but is more interested in the children when they appear. They in turn seem curious enough about her, but seem to realise the situation is serious and follow Khol’s orders.
“Great, you saved a few people. Commendable. We’ve saved dozens. Jedi, friends of Jedi, family of Jedi, rangers, members of the service corps. They *were* in *real* need. They faced torture, death. Don’t you dare call that an illusion. You’re out of touch, Khol. There is a bigger picture, even if you’re too scared and in pain to see it.”
The Twi’lek runs her blue fingers along a partially dismantled engine.
“Things break, Khol. You can throw them away, or you can try to put them back together. Make them stronger than before. Seems you know a little something about putting things back together. Or you should.”
”Khol? Everything okay?” Garth has reappeared with his pack, Lyra and Ti’an behind him in the doorway.
“It’s fine kid,” Alaris says, “your friend and I just don’t agree on something, it seems. Let’s focus on what’s important: what now, Khol? You’re the man with the plan and the friendly chatter in his ear.”

---

Khol merely shrugs at Alaris’s impassioned response, showing that he is no longer interested in the conversation. He looks over the three children, and moves to tighten the straps on Lyra’s small travel bag, while also quickly tying Ti’an’s shoes.
“We’re going to meet Captain Benla at the docks, and hitch a ride on his ship the... the *Second Smile*.” Khol stumbles over the ship name, and quickly glances at the three to see if the dirty joke of a name causes any giggling.
“From there we’ll be away. We’ll drop you and Adalyn wherever you’re going, and we’ll see where the Captain is headin’ afterwards.”
The Korunnai then crouches down and lays a hand each on Garth’s and Ti’an’s shoulders, with Lyras framed between the both of them.
“Remember: Always stay together, no matter what. If anything happens to me or Miss Alaris,” Khol glances over his shoulder at the twi’lek, “on our way there, you make sure to get to the docks and find Captain Benla and the Second Smile. Mister Veva and Uncle Jack will be there waiting for you.”
Khol then stands up and lifts his own pack, one that appears far heavier than three *children*, plus Alaris, combined.
“Everyone have what they need? Good, then let’s go!”
Taking one last look around, Khol buries his head and is out the door leading the way to the docks, and hopefully their salvation.
