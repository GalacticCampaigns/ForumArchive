# [After Effects] Chapter Two

### **Rowen** (2007-09-27 11:34:48)

[hide]**Rowen**
Dren entered the room and found Karr sitting at the head of the table just as he had when she brought the Droid to him. She wondered for a moment if he had moved at all. His elbows rested on the table before him and his hands were together. His chin rest in his outstretched thumbs and his fingers formed a steeple. He closely resembled someone in prayer.
His eyes followed Dren to his location. She was dressed differently. Instead of the flesh wrap and heels she had on earlier that day. She now wore a loose tunic with a utility belt about her waist and a heavy blaster at her side. Her tight pants were tucked into calf high, brown boots. Her gait was still as graceful as before.
Karr smiled gently to her and lifted his head. â€œYou look the spitting image of someone about to have fun. â€œ He winked at her. â€œIâ€™m afraid you will be sitting this one out though.â€ Her reaction was expected. She frowned heavily at him and placed her hands on her hips. It was just as he hand envisioned it, even down to the foot tapping the floor. â€œYou will have your fun in due time my dear,â€ He assured her. â€œBut for now the circumstances have changed.â€
Her foot stopped tapping and she folded her arms across her chest. â€œHow so?â€ Her voice was like venom. Karr nonchalantly waved his hand as if it were a minor detail. â€œIn due time.â€ He scratched the bridge of his nose. â€œI promise all well be made clear. Have patients is all I ask.â€
Karr looked at his datapad. â€œAlmost time. Our guests should be arriving back any minute now.â€ He motioned for Dren to take her place behind him. She hesitated for a moment then slowly and with a heavy sigh walked over to her position.
Sorka was the first to arrive. She entered the room slowly, taking in all her surroundings as she did. Her eyes locked onto Karrâ€™s then quickly meet with Drenâ€™s. Dren managed a slight smirk and nodded ever so slightly to her. She also noticed that the two guards were not present. Instead, to either side of Karr but well behind Dren stood a male Zabrak and a human male. Sorka stretched out with the force, could sense the force in the Zabrak, he had potential. She then shifted to the male, her eyes flew open a look of surprise on her face. Sensing the others were close by she moved to the same spot she had been standing when first they meet, her eyes stayed fixed on the human male however.
**DarthAnthrax**
Ganthos were the second one to enter. Having spent time among the jedi, honing his untrained force senses, he could also sense the force in the zabrak. The observation was a bit unexpected, and triggered his natural self-preserving instincts. He positioned himself next to Sorka, carefully eying the two people that had obviously replaced KarrÂ´s guards.
---------------------------------
(OOC: Ganthos makes perception checks to search the two newcomers for hidden weapons and other signs that they might be a threat)
**simplyscribed**
Red strides into the room, head angling quickly to survey those already inside, sensor lights pulsing dully.
'I have analysed the plans.' He comments in his cultured tones. 'Secuirty seems unforgivably lax. Are you sure the information is accurate?'
**Rowen**
"The information is correct." He leans forward ever so slightly. "My informant assures me that security has not changed." Karr looks to each of the companions. "But be careful just the same. The last thing I need is the Hutts breathing down MY neck." He accentuated the word "my".
**master_Tru**
Jace enters bows to Karr and eyes the newcomers. "Well Karr its seems that our arangement has changed, please if you could bring the rest of us up to speed on your plan." Jace looks gain to the new comers gives a slight bow."My name is Jace stars."
**reverend_tobias**
((OOC: Ganthos notices nothing obvious about the human male. I'll let Rowen handle the check, though.))
The human looks over at the party, gives a short, curt nod. "Laneth."
**DarthAnthrax**
Ganthos notices a certain calm about the human male, and in the shifting lightning he catches a fleeting glimpse of a small object by the humans side. Processing this new information, he looks over at Karr.
"So Karr, what is it that you arenÂ´t telling us? ThereÂ´s obviously something, why else would a jedi suddenly appear out of nowhere at your side as you are about to give us the mission specifics?"
Ganthos straingthens his pose, but doesnÂ´t make any hostile movement.
-------------------------
(OOC: Ganthos makes a use the force check to determine if the human really is force-sensitive (take 10))
**reverend_tobias**
Laneth doesn't respond to Ganthos at all. He just glimpses up at Karr for a second and listens to the man's response.
**Rowen**
Karr straightens up in his chair, and stares a Ganthos for a minute. "I heard reports of another Jedi in the area." He casually gestures toward Laneth. "I had Dren go out and bring him here. I figured it would be more prudent for him to stick with your little band of merry men." He chuckles. "And women." He amends and gives a little bow to Sorka.
"Ill save the rest of the plan changes until all of you are present. I loath having to repeat myself."
**simplyscribed**
Red glances at the new Jedi. In as much as it is possible for a droid's features to express interest, the flaring of his light sensors seems to indicate it. It's curious that he is programmed to "emote" - yet more evidence that he's more than just some stock droid.
'I have a few things to say myself after Karr is through.' He adds. 'Since I possess the sole copy of the plans, that would appear to make me de facto leader on this mission, so I'll need to make sure I'm satisfied with our state of preparation before taking on the responsibility.'
**reverend_tobias**
Laneth looks over at the droid as he finishes. A bit of annoyance flashes across his face, but only for a second. He gives a slight shrug and waits patiently with his eyes closed.
((OOC: For what it matters, he's going to use (Force) Perception to notice when others enter the room or, however quietly.))
**Rebaav**
A nod is directed at each individual when they look at him but nothing is said. (OOC: 10 on Perception to look for any gear & same on Know:Tech to assess it) Attention is paid to the Droid when it enters & begins speaking. A slight smirk is shown then suppressed & a nod is offered to the Droid with noticeably more interest (OOC: Perhaps a roll on Perception & KnowTech if that is how focused interest is handled).
**Rowen**
Karr starts to speak but stops abruptly as a figure emerges from the main room and heads toward him. He reaches Karr and bends low, whispering something in his ear. Karr listens carefully and looks to the man once he is finished speaking. â€œAre you sure?â€ You hear him ask. The man nods and Karr motions for him to leave.
Karr waits until the messenger is completely out of the room before clearing his throat and speaking. â€œI was just informed that the other two members of your group are no where to be found.â€ There was a seriousness in his voice. â€œIt is not known where they have gone only that they were last seen browsing the market place together.â€ He absently rubs the bridge of his nose. â€œYou will have to leave with out them. There is no time to wait. It seems that Varr Hutt is moving up in the world as well. There are roaming guards in side the facility now.â€ He shifts in his seat obviously rattled by the news. â€œI donâ€™t expect they will be much of a challenge for your group.â€
He looks to each member in turn. â€œDren will not be accompanying you. I believe Kehn Shoad will fill her role nicely.â€ He gestures to the Zabrak. "He has not been in my employment long thus having less loyalties than Dren. I assume that should make you a little more at ease.â€ He grins to Red. â€œThe Jedi is a neutral party looking for much the same thing as you.â€ He pauses. â€œ A way off this rock.â€
â€œTransportation will be provided. I have modified a Metrocab airspeeder to be manually piloted, the cargo area has been removed to provide enough space for your entire group.â€ He stands and walks toward Red, stopping just before the droid. â€œOnce you have the Power core, place it in the airspeeder and make your escape to the my hangar, your ship will be prepped and ready.â€ He studies Red for a moment. â€œAny questions?â€
**simplyscribed**
'Not for you, Karr.' Red replies.
'For the rest of the group however? Yes. The only one I need answered before we leave however, is this - how many of you have comlinks? We may need to split up and I want to be prepared for that eventuality. We will need to program them to a secure line. If anyone is compromised, their first concern should be to change their comlink's settings or destroy the hardware, so security cannot eavesdrop on the rest of us.'[/hide]

**master_Tru**
Jace trys to reach out with the force and find his friends.
((jace uses the force takes a 10))
"Until now I have not needed a comlink Red."Jace looks distracted as he searches the planet for his friends. Jaces face becomes saddened "I would hope that it will not come to splitting up, though if it happenes ..... " Jace looks to his friends "please be careful."
**Rowen**
Sorka turns to the group. "I have a comlink, its short range which should be no problem inside a building." She pushes a stray hair from her eyes and waits for the others to respond to Reds question.
**reverend_tobias**
Laneth steps away from the far wall and Karr and toward the group. I, unfortunately, don't have a comlink. I carry only a weapon, he says, as he visibly tucks the lightsaber hilt out of conspicuous view.
**Rebaav**
Inquisitive look at Jace. I have a long range comlink, though I am unclear as to what we are discussing or what my role is going to be.
To Red. Since time is apparantly of the essence perhaps I can be briefed on route, in the interest of getting the task accomplished?
**simplyscribed**
The droid nods.
'We'll have time en-route.'
**Rowen**
Karr clears his throat. "If your finished the only thing left to decide is who will be the pilot." He looks from one person to the next. "Please tell me at least one of you can pilot the craft."
**DarthAnthrax**
"Well I have no experience at all with flying, so my plan was to let someone else handle that. However I beleive at least one of these gentlemen knows how to fly a ship"
Ganthos nods to the newcomers.
"I donÂ´t think youÂ´d send us off whitout a pilot"
**Rebaav**
Looks around the room, then a resigned shoulder shrug, "If we haven't an alternative, I have piloted my share of a variety of vehicles."
**simplyscribed**
'Good enough.' Red insists. 'I'm hoping we can avoid any difficult chases in the air. Just try not to get killed or we'll have to try piloting the transport without training.'
**Rebaav**
Eyes narrow at Red "I think that would be best accomplished with us looking out for each other, don't you agree?" Shoad now seems visibly tense.
**Rowen**
"I hate to intervene but time is of the essence." Karr states. "Keep the craft at the programed altitude, heading and speed and you will do fine. Remember your trying to pass off as a droid controlled conveyance."
Sorka move's closer to the group. "I think we should get moving. The quicker we get done the faster we can leave and move some where safer." You notice a slight quiver in her voice. She places her head on her head and holds on to Jace's shoulder for support visibly shaken by something.
**Rebaav**
Inquisitive look directed at both Jace & Sorka. "Red, since 'time is of the essence' please lead me to the vehicle I will be piloting & brief me on what we are about to do." Gestures to the door.
**simplyscribed**
'Is the metrocab outside, Karr?' Red asks, not knowing where the transport is himself.
**Rowen**
"Theres an pad on the second floor of this building." He sighs and pushes past the the group and turns back to them at the door. "Follow me and Ill take you to it."
Karr leads the group to the back of the Cantina. It wasn't as filled with patrons as when they first entered earlier that morning. No one seemed to even notice them heading to the back and disappear into the service area.
Just inside were steep steps that lead to the top floor and the pad. The cab was just being uncovered by some of Karr's lackeys when everyone finally arrived at the top. Karr strolled over to it and pushed a softly glowing square light and the hatched opened and a small set of stairs lowered to the floor.
"Ill be waiting for the Cargo to arrive." He pauses and steps up to Red holding out his hand. "And good luck."

### **Rowen** (2007-09-27 11:44:22)

**Rowen**
Once on the top of the cantina the group enters the metrocab. Shoad takes the controls after brief instructions from Karr. The controls were very intuitive and would tell the driver how fast to go, when to stop, basically mimicking the behavior of a metrocab. Karr issued one last instruction, which was to load the power core in the cab. It would auto pilot back to another predetermined location. The group was then to proceed to the hanger where the YT-1300 was kept.
The flight was fairly uneventful. At one point a Hutt vehicle pulled dangerously close to the metrocab with guns ready and primed. Abruptly it peeled off from behind the metrocab and blew another vehicle that closely resembled the one you were in right out of the sky. Shortly after Shoad landed the metrocab very smoothly on the landing grid of the research center.
Shoad stayed in the vehicle to perform any system shut downs needed (and to get a better look at the system layout J ). The rest started to survey the surrounding area. Immediately they realized that the over head lights had been shot out and that the security camera was also in pieces at the base of its pole, both had a healthy amount of carbon scoring.
Slowly they advanced with Ganthos in the lead. As they neared the doors they could see two figures just off to the side. Everyone pulled out there weapons, holding them at the ready and preceded with silent communication. Ganthos continued to advance and as he got closer could tell the two figures hand been shot in the chest and head, both were dead. Sorka advanced to stand beside Ganthos, suggesting he check for any form of identification. He found half melted security badges with the Varr Hutt logo imprinted on them.
The rest of the group arrived just in time to see the identification badges and hear Ganthos inform Sorka that the men were dead. Shoad having taken to long in the vehicle rushed up behind the group, missing the entire conversation.
**DarthAnthrax**
Standing up from examining the dead bodies, Ganthos turns to the rest of the group.
"Red, what route should take us to where we need to go in the shortest time? Chances are, thatÂ´s where our competition has entered, and that security along that path will be disabled or at least lessened. If we enter the same path, we should be able to save ourselves some trouble, not to mention running into our new friends if theyÂ´re trying to get away"
He looked over the rest of the group, awaiting input or objections.
**simplyscribed**
'A good thought, but not one we can act on.'
Red explains the situation as he understands it from the plans: 'We only know that our target is inside, though not where; although it stands to reason it's in one of the labs so we don't have to linger long in the lobby, for example. The building is split into areas, numbered on my map, and each numbered area has a security droid with a camera. Only one is on at a time, but their order doesn't follow the numerical or geographical order of the rooms. Unless our competitors have left us an obvious trail, our best bed is to make sure we are several steps ahead of the cameras. You will have to rely on my guidance for that. Of course, if all the cameras have been deactivated, and all of the guards inside are as dead as these two, then we just follow the destruction and hope we arrive in time to take our prize.'
**reverend_tobias**
Laneth nods, understanding the droid's reasoning. "Then let us begin, gentlemen."
**master_Tru**
Jace flips his saber in his hand "sounds good to me Red, take the lead I am ready and I believe the rest of us are ready as well."
**Rowen**
Sorka nods her agreement with both Jace and Laneth. "I'm ready if everyone else is." She glances at the dead bodies and pales slightly.
**simplyscribed**
Red nods his metal head and moves with as much stealth as he can manage to the door. If the composition of the door allows it, he will attempt to see inside. Otherwise, he will stand to one side, minimising his exposure as a target, and open it.
**Rowen**
Red approaches the door. Its mostly made of clear duraplex plating and the view inside is crystal clear.
From your vantage point you can see the lobby and its plush seats. The help desk is to the right and papers have been strewn about. You see no signs of movement.
**simplyscribed**
Red enters and makes his way across the lobby with the aim of moving to room 4. He constantly monitors his surroundings, and when he reaches the hall past which is his destination, he takes every precaution to check it is safe before crossing to the next room.
**master_Tru**
Waiting for Reds signal to proceed Jace reaches out with the force.
((takes a 10 on use force to sense suroundings))
Whispering Jace speaks out to Red " We await your lead Red is it clear?"
**Rowen**
Red makes his way to the back of the lobby and activates the sliding doors. They open with a low hiss, he leans his head around the corner.
You see a few papers scattered threw the hall. A few are stuck under the door to room 4, which is right across from you.
As you scan the area you pick up hushed tones from farther down the hall, most likely from one of the rooms toward the end of the hall. You can almost make out what there saying from your vantage point.
**DarthAnthrax**
Following the others, Ganthos stops at hearing sounds farther down the hall. trying to extend his awareness to be able to properly eavesdrop on the conversation, he closes his eyes to center himself
(Take 10 on UtF for sense surroundings, then make a Perception check and aim for the highest possible result)
**master_Tru**
Still looking to Red for a signal Jace whispers back to Ganthos, "there are three of them up ahead in the next room." Jace tightens the grip on his lightsaber and gives a nod to the rest of the group.
**simplyscribed**
Red turns as he hears Jace's comment, nods, and gestures for silence. Then he points at Jace and Ganthos, and indicates that they should go down the hall and investigate.
**Rowen**
Sorka pads quietly in behind Red, her lightsaber held loosely in her right hand. She cocks her head to one side straining to make out the conversation down the hall.
After a few moments she shakes her head and shruggs.[/hide]

**master_Tru**
Jace nods to Ganthos and follows Reds lead ... as quitly as he can muster Jace proceeds down the hall, lightsaber firmly gripped in hand.
**DarthAnthrax**
Sending an affirmative nod at Jace, and back to Red and Sorka, Ganthos draws his blaster and proceeds cautiously down the hall, staying close to the wall opposite of Jace. He tries to get whitin range so that he might make out what is being said, but focuses primarialy on his and the others safety.
**Rowen**
Jace and Ganthos move down the hall with considerable skill and are soon with in hearing range of who ever is in that room. (The room is room 8, for Jace and Ganthos thats the first one on the left.)
(Jace and Ganthos hear the following)
"Would you hurry UP!" A voice that is familiar to you says in forced undertones.
"My dear Jake, things such as this are delicate and cannot be rushed." Another familiar voice answers Jake.
You hear a heavy sigh. "I'm sorry Mel, I'm just.......I'm just a bit edgy." Jake apologizes.
You hear a loud slam, as if a pile of papers were dropped onto the desk and a female voice scolds the two men. "If you two would stop argueing like little children we could get out of here! We should have been finished and back with Karr by now!" You can hear the anger and frustration in her voice.
"Why Dren, you have so little faith in us." Mel Doon chuckles. "and there, see...........I've done it!" He proclaims and you can swear he must be grinning.
You hear feet shuffling and Dren exclaims. "You're in? Well, where is it then?"
"Patients my dear, patients." Mel Doon answers and you hear nothing for several moments, then he speaks again. "Ahhh, there you are. Looks like they were testing the load capacity, its in the Power core."
"Alright, lets get this thing and get out of here before the troopers arrive." Dren says.
You hear more shuffling.
"Yeah, my only wish is that we could see the looks on those idiots face when they get here and find the power core already gone." He laughs.
**DarthAnthrax**
Resisting the urge to dash into the room with blaster in hand, Ganthos centers himself and gives a quiet signal for the rest of the group to hurry forward. He moves forward and presses himself close to the wall next to the door opening, setting his blaster for stun.
(ready an action to shoot anyone leaving the room)
**Rebaav**
((take 10 on perception to see if Shoad notices what Red & company are doing. If he sees the positioning & blaster draw then he hides behind the corpses on the floor drawing weapon & makes ready with stun setting if stun will reach beyond the door. If he doesn't then he looks around to see what he needs to do to see whats left of the security cameras))
**master_Tru**
Jace nods to Ganthos Stands in front of him (without blocking his line of fire but still providing cover to his friend). Lightsaber ready to ignite Jace stands posed to take action.
((OOC jace readies an action to active the lightsaber and go partial defence, Jace also takes a 10 on use force to send a telepathic message to Sorka "Betrayed"))
**Rowen**
Sorka pales as she hears Tru's telepathic communication. She grips her lightsaber tighter and pushes past Red, slowly advancing down the hall to help her friends.
**reverend_tobias**
Seeing Sorka's expression and seeing the others prepare for an encounter, Laneth quietly walks up behind the others. He tightens his grip on his lightsaber, waiting for the strike.
**simplyscribed**
Not being a complete and utter gonk droid, Red doesn't have a problem picking up on the visual cues being made by his allies. He raises his blaster carbine and takes aim on the door through which the murmurs of conversation are coming.
((OOC: Aim, and readying to fire on the first person to come through the door.))
**Rowen**
Mel Doon, Jake and Dren leave the room at the same time. Mel Doon and Jake are on the side closest the group and Dren behind them on their side.
Ganthos and Red fire at Mel Doon. Reds blaster bolt arcs wide and hits the wall to the right in a shower of sparks. Ganthos blaster bolt slams into Mel Doon forcing him back into Dren who stumbles backward a step. Jake attempts to recover, raising his blaster at Jace and Ganthos. Jace prepares to either defend or attack, they are still too far away for a melee attack.
Sorka advances further down the hall, igniting her saber as she does. Lanith reaches the door just at the moment Red fires his Carbine, and Shoad is threw the doors approximately half way to Red and Lanith.
(End of surprise round, Regular combat begins)
**master_Tru**
Steping sideways to his potential foes Jace ignites his Saber, " friends what has become of us, you must see that Karr is using you? We should work together and leave this planet." Jace takes a step forward while still keeping Ganthos behind him.
((swift action to activate the saber, standard action full defence (+10 defence), standard action to move within one square of the closest of Mel Doon, Jake or Dren))
**DarthAnthrax**
Seeing Mel Doon stumble backwards from his shot, Ganthos keeps his blaster fixed on Dren.
"You better keep the Kel Dor in your arms and make no sudden moves Dren"
Turning to Jake he adds:
"Put the gun down Jake, you donÂ´t stand a chance, and we donÂ´t want to hurt you"
(Ready an action to fire at Dren, and take aim to ignore the cover she has from Mel Doon, if any)
**simplyscribed**
Red keeps silent. He has no pressing desire to give these organics a chance for "redemption", but he honours the attempt being made by his comrades. He refocuses his aim on Dren, determining her to be the biggest threat.
((Readied action to fire on Dren, aiming again to negate her cover from Mel Doon))
**reverend_tobias**
If there is any open space, Laneth is going to get closer to the traitors, his lightsaber held up, ready to cut down anyone who makes any sudden movements.
He is silent, not knowing or caring about the relationship between the other party members, but he eyes Dren evily.
**Rowen**
Jake snarls at the group. "Oh come on! We got a better deal me and Mel." He raises his weapon at Jace. "If we stay with you were hunted. This way we would have walked away richer! But you keep screwing things up!"
Jace ignites his saber and moves in front of Jake. Jake fires directly at Jace with no hesitation and the blaster bolt is neatly defleced.
Red takes aim and fires one in Dren's direction. Mel Doon was to close and the bolt hits him directly in the chest and he colapses to the floor.
Lanith manages to cover half the distance to Jace and Ganthos. While Shoad arrives at Reds side in time to see his blaster fire take down Mel Doon.
Ganthos fires at Dren barely missing her head by a fraction of a centimeter. Sorka rushes up to Dren twirling her saber and quickly strikes her in the chest. Dren howls in pain and backs away, her tunic smoking.
Dren levels her blaster at Sorka and fires. The point blank blaster fire doubles the young Jedi over and she slumps slowly to the floor, curled up in a fetal position. "You will NOT stop us!" Dren screams.

**DarthAnthrax**
"Oh, is she starting to make me real mad", Ganthos lets out. Giving Jace some space to swing his saber, he backs a few steps, but not befor flipping his blaster to lethal and firing at Dren.
(Swift action to change fire modes, Move action to fall back a couple of steps, and a standard action to fire at Dren)
**master_Tru**
At the loss of Sorka tears steam out of Jaces eyes, rage takes over his emotions clouding his judgement "SORKA NO!" surprising Ganthos who is close enough to see, Jace looks at Dren with hatred in his eyes. " Scutta you will pay for that, if she dies so do you." Jace abandons any threat Jake may have posed runs past him, "Ganthos shot Jake in the head" and with a two handed swing strikes at Dren.
((Jace moves past Jake possibly provoking an attack of op, uses running attack to move up to Dren and strike them move behind her trying to gain a flanking bonus, Jace blows a force point for his tumble check to avoid Jake ))
**simplyscribed**
Whether something in his programming allows Red to recognise Jace's claim on Dren, or whether he simply deems the young Jedi capable of eliminating her himself, the end result is that he switches target to Jake.
'Betrayal is such an ugly thing.' He comments, firing on Jake.
((OOC: Aim to negate any soft cover from the allies in front of him, fires on Jake))
**Rebaav**
With eyes squinted in intense concentration, and shakey shoulders, Shoad cowers near Red & points his blaster @ Jake.
((Aim & holding action on Jake, if he tries anything other than act like someone who has just been shot, Shoad will give him the chance to act properly by discharging a stun shot))
**Rowen**
Jake turns to fire on Jace as he rushes past and pulls the trigger. Jace takes the shot in the side but keeps running for Dren. He reaches her and slashes at her chest, ignoring his own pain. His saber sparks as it connects and the smell of burning flesh fills the hall. Dren screams out in pain, clutching her chest.
Jake quickly wheels his blaster level with Ganthos and squeezes off a quick shot. His nerves rattled by the scream of his new companion send his shot wide, missing Ganthos entirely.
Red takes a moment for Jace to pass, see's him take a shot to the ribs but keep moveing. Just as Jake fires off his shot at Ganthos Red pulls his trigger. Jakes leading shoulder takes the hit, pushing him back melting the fabric and charring the skin.
Lanith arrives by Ganthos and decides to let Jace have his revenge, his lightsaber comes down hard at Jake who while injured still managed to move just out of reach.
Shoad takes aim from behind Red his shakey grip on the blaster sending the bolt nowhere close to the intended target.
Ganthos ducks a little as a stray blaster bolt from behind discharges close to his head. Recovers and fires at Jake. Jakes eyes widen as Ganthos takes quick aim and tries to roll out of the way, instead taking the bolt to the side of the head. He lands face first on the floor next to Mel Doon his weapon skittering across the floor.
Dren bares her teeth at Jace and removes her blood covered hand from her chest and fires. Her shot sails just past Jaces ear and her eyes narrow. "My next shot wont miss boy!"
((Jace deduct 12 hit points from your total please))
**master_Tru**
Grunting in pain, Jace ignores his own discomfort and focus stays on Dren alone. " You will never get another shot off." Jace remarks coldly to Dren. Still with a two handed grip Jace raises his saber for another blow, turning sidesways to Dren providing a smaller target.
((Jace goes partial defence(+5 defence), and takes another swing at Dren (-5 atk roll) ))
**DarthAnthrax**
Seing Jake fall to the ground, Ganthos drops to a kneeling position in order to give his companions a clearer wiew. Seeing Jace lunge at Dren with a powerful two-handed blow, he decides that the young jedi can take care of this foe himself. Instead, he shifts his aim a little, laying down blasterfire that forces Dren to stay to the side of the hall, minimizing her escape routes.
(Use two swift actions to aim and ignore any cover Jace might be giving Dren, then use a standard action to aid Jaces attack roll)
**simplyscribed**
The calculations occuring inside Red's metal cranium are long and complicated, but occur at a speed to rival - maybe even outsrip - human thought. He arrives at the conclusion that his earlier decision to leave Dren to Jace has no value in the current tactical reality, and his carbine's barrel is swiftly shifted to aim at the most visible part of the woman.
((OOC: Again, aim to negate cover then fire, this time targeting Dren.))
**Rebaav**
Eyes dart around at whats happening but attention still on Jake)
(Aim for whatever it's worth & fire on Jake again & look for any cover that's available. If Red is it: staying near)

- Jace raises his saber above his head and swings. The move was so fast one watching would have only seen a blur as the blade swiped threw the air. They couldn't be sure he had even hit her. She stood there, unmoving, smoke drifting from her chest. Then her blaster fell to the floor and she crumpled in a heap at Jace's feet.

Before he can take his shot, Dren is dead. Red lowers his blaster carbine and walks along the corridor, stepping over her corpse and looking into the room beyond.
As he does so he goes over the plans and the timetable , working out which camera is in this room in case it's still online, and which camera in the facility should currently be active.

At seeing Dren fall before the jediÂ´s saber, Ganthos lets out breath of relief. Holstering his blaster, he kneels by Sorka, checking her vital signs and does what he can to stabilise her. Feeling little hope though, he takes Sorkas lightsaber and clips it to his own belt, determined to have the spirit of his friend live on through it.
(Makes a First Aid check to try and help her (I think thereÂ´s a medpac in my utility belt))

Jace paces behind Ganthos "Will she be ok? How is she? Whats taking so long?" Obviously still not thinking clearly Jace has not deactivated his saber, it hisses as it burns through the air.
Suddenly aware of what has happened what he has done, Jace switches off the saber and with a tear to his eye sits cross legged on the other side of Sorka trying to reach out to her through the force. "Don`t die on us."

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-09-30 16:28:46)

Ganthos lowers his head, and slowly draws his fingers over Sorkas face, closing her eyes for good. For several moments he sits silently, those closest to him can se his lips moving. Then he rises and looks over to the others and the sadness in his face is obvious.
"LetÂ´s do what we came for and get out of here, before anymoe lives are lost"
Then his face hardens, and he checks the lightsaber now attatched to his belt.
"And then Karr will have a few things to explain"

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **simplyscribed** (2007-09-30 16:38:23)

'It is doubtful he feels like explaining.' Red comments. 'A double-cross is a double-cross, though I'm at a loss to explain why he did it. However, you're right about finishing what we started - it's obvious the ship we were offered was never on the cards, but maybe we can still get it if we have a bargaining chip.'
The droid steps into the room and begins searching in earnest.
'We have under two minutes to check this room.' He explains.

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **master_Tru** (2007-09-30 16:50:31)

Jace site cross legged resiting the jedi code under his breath, he take no part in searching the room nor does he scavenge anything from the fallen. "Sorka you are one with the force." Jace stands and nods to Red signaling that he is ready to leave (thinking the droid might not understand his actions, he does not explain it to him.) Jace closes his eyes for one moment further reaching out with the force to find his lost friend, wiping the tears from his eyes Jace heads for the door.

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **Rowen** (2007-09-30 18:22:25)

Everyone goes about the task of search when suddenly the floor begins to shake and the walls vibrate. You can hear the unmistakeable sounds of a ships repulsor lifts near by. A loud boom follows and what can only be shrapnel hitting the outside of the building.

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **master_Tru** (2007-09-30 18:35:27)

"Snap could today be any better." Reaching out with the force Jace try`s to get answers. Jace stops for a second and closes his eyes, his mind exploring outside the walls. "I not sure if the camera rotation will matter much anymore, this could be a distraction for us to get out."
((jace takes a 10 on use force to sense surroundings))

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **simplyscribed** (2007-09-30 18:54:37)

'It's coming from outside the lobby.' Red comments. 'We may need to find an alternate exit. I wouldn't have trusted Karr's cab a second time anyway.'
He moves back to the door, blaster carbine raised in readiness once more. Already he is trying to plan an escape strategy. There was no mention of a second exit on the plans, but no Hutt facility would only have a front door, right?

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **master_Tru** (2007-09-30 18:57:46)

"I will make a door if I have too." To emphasize his point Jace holds up his light saber. "We have been found clones and lots of them." Jace takes a peek outside the door with Red. "Any ideas?"

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-01 00:46:39)

"There was a time when the arrival of clones was a good thing"
Ganthos abandons the futile search of the room, and joins his friends by the door, drawing his blaster an holding it at the ready.
"You are the one with the layouts here Red, is there anyway we could go?"

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-01 05:12:49)

"We need to move to the back of the building, the southern most room, I have found a way out." Jace looks at Ganthos "Just trust me on this, the force is with me." Then Jace looks at Red "I won`t be able to explain it to you like I did to Ganthos, but its our only way out, pull up the files on the southern rooms whats there?"

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-01 07:08:17)

'An exit. That's good enough for me.' The droid quips, hurrying out of the door at an equivalent to a jog and leading the way to the room marked Room 2 on his plans.

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-01 10:33:36)

Glad that Jace has apparently found some way to get out of the mess, Ganthos starts to look down the hall from the lobby, as he waits for all his companions to get going towards their new exit. In case the clones are faster than them, he slips a Frag Grenade into his hand as well.
Ready an action to throw the grenade down the hall from the lobby (the one they all came through) if any clones show up that way. Else he takes the rear once the remainder of the group has started towards the exit

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-01 10:51:57)

Jace takes pace next to Red in front shouting back "Hey Chron Lanith, Kehn Shoad I don`t know what your doing but we have one chance to get out alive follow us." Jace looks down to his former comrades, then to Dren and one last look at Sorka "May the force be with you always." Jace continues on.

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **Rowen** (2007-10-01 11:13:56)

-Red jogs out of the room, heading for their escape. A clone trooper emerges from the lobby and fires. The blaster bolt sizzles just in front of Jace causing him to sway back to avoid being hit. Red was not so lucky, the bolt slams into his his right flank in a shower of sparks and loose hardware. ((Red takes 16 points of DMG, -1 on condition track))
- Ganthos lobs his grenade down the hall. It lands at the clones feet and explodes sending his weapon flying down the hall and launching him back threw the lobby doors.
- Lanith rush out of the room with his saber in hand. See's the clone trooper get blown back threw the door. Thinks to himself that Ganthos has matters under control and follows the others.
- Shoad is making his way out of the room and quickens his pace when he hears blaster fire and the explosion.

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-01 11:24:31)

Igniting his saber Jace makes a run for it zig zagging down the hall. "The will be more behind him lets use Ganthos`s distraction and run for it." 
((swift action to activate light saber, action to go partial defence +10, and move action don the hall. Jace will deflect as a reaction.))

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-01 12:41:30)

Seeing his grenade had the desired effect, Ganthos quickly moves to follow the others down the hall. Upon casing a quick glance in the hallway he makes a suprising observation and calls out to his companions down the hall.
"Be on your guard guys, thereÂ´s one of our former friends that didnÂ´t stay down"
(Use a full-round action to run and catch up with the others)

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

Great writers have described all manner of things with an amazing array of eloquent statements. Sadly, this will not be ranked among those greats.
Red legs it.

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **Rowen** (2007-10-03 20:27:08)

Everyone bolts for the room Red is leading them to and makes it between the sliding doors. Just then a explosion in the south corner of the room causes the wall to crumble away. You hear a voice call out from that very corner.
"Let's move!" Jace recognizes that voice immediatly.
Upon arriving at the hole you see a man half in and half out of a YT-1300. He looks up at Tru and smiles. "You'll have to jump, this is as close as we can get without driving trough the build."

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-03 20:38:35)

"Master Yu, it has been some time." Jace can`t believe his eyes, almost thinks he is dreaming. Hearing the shells hit the Hutt compound Jace takes a leap of faith.
((running jump if he rolls low Jace uses a force point.))
Once on board he make a quick bow to Master Yu, then holds out his arm to assist his friend aboard.

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-04 03:30:56)

Still worried about the midding Kel Dor, Ganthos takes a final look around, then leaps towards the YT-1300 and the person that Jace called master.
(Add a Force Point if I roll badly on the Jump check. Also I could not find anything on the time for Jump checks. If I have time left in the same round, I make a Perception check to locate any sign of Mel Doon, rerolling if I have to)

---

## If I had pale skin & a Starfleet uniform ...

### **Rebaav** (2007-10-04 19:23:30)

With a grin of almost insane intensity Shoad takes a running leap into the air towards the transport.
(Force point to avoid failure if needed & any free perception rolls for distance & footing)
If he makes it, those within earshot can hear him mumbling & chuckling about a droid talking about 'cards' & 'bargaining chips' & shivering & twitching about maniacs with lightsabers. This goes back & forth with a blank stare at a far wall.

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-04 20:49:08)

Red too takes a running jump, relying on his jump servos to carry him across the gap.
((OOC: Yeah - Red jumps, and if he fails he "rerolls" thanks to his Jump servos but rather than rolling takes 10, again thanks to his Jump servos. If the result of 12 that nets him also fails, he spends a Force point to add a d6 to the result.))

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **Rowen** (2007-10-04 22:16:09)

All of you jump and make it to the top of the ship with great ease. Master Yu motions for all of you to quickly get inside. "Follow me to the cabin, there I will answer all your questions." With that he disappears down the hatch, heading for the cabin.
((Feel free to ask Master Yu and questions you can think of.))

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-05 04:54:06)

Taking a few moment to let the adrenaline rush out of him, Ganthos finds a place to sit down.
"Okay, let me get this straight. We were sent by a smuggler to steal some secret plans from a Hutt compound, then we were double-crossed by said smuggler and a few former allies, of wich one is actually still unaccounted for. Then all the sudden a company of clone troopers appear out of the blue, and then when it looks like weÂ´re all gonna be bantha podoo, a jedi master blasts us out of the compund in the last minute"
Drawing in a deep breath, he continues
"So IÂ´m guessing that what I want to know is essentially: WhatÂ´s going on here that weÂ´re unaware of, and whats your involvement in it, master jedi?"

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-05 14:55:45)

"Master Yu it has been some time I had thought the clone troopers had gotten you. It is good to see you again, I have many questions for you how did you escape? How did you find me? Where are we to go now?" Jace stops himself from asking more as to not overwhelm Master Yu. Jace gives a low bow to Master Yu "Thank you Master Yu for the rescue, may the force be with us all."

---

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **Rowen** (2007-10-07 20:52:04)

Master Yu crosses into the common room and sits across from everyone. He looks tired and wipes his brow before looking up at Jace. "I've been tracking you for some time Padawan." He takes a slow deep breath.
"Its required hovering on the edge of the dark side in order to stay under the radar of the Emperor and his new lackey, Lord Vader." His face contorted in what you can only imagine must be emotional pain. "But I found you!"
"It wasn't hard to follow your trail," He allowed a smile and looked to Red. "Karr is an interesting fellow. Seems he was quite ready to talk to me after a little negotiation." He paused, stood and started to pace. Probably the only thing keeping him awake.
"Once I realized Karr's plan I presented myself to Varr Hutt, told him what I had found out and that I sent my best men in to prevent the theft of the power core." He grined. "He knew Karr's plan, had set him up with the chip you have in your head." He pointed to Red. "The power core was never in that building to begin with. But as a reward for being faithful to the Hutts he allowed me the security access codes to leave orbit."
He clasped his hands behind his back and looked each member over. "We're headed for the outter rim planet of Tatooine. There we will not be Jedi." He looked to Jace and Lanith. "We will be simple people looking for simple work. We will lay low until we are needed once again." He headed for the cockpit and offered over his shoulder. "This starts a new day."

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-07 21:08:23)

Red nods his head and his sensor lights flare brilliantly.
'Karr's scheme still fails to compute, but it doesn't matter now.'
He settles down to repair his damaged systems.
((OOC: Second Wind.))

## Re: After Effects - Chapter Two

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-08 03:59:20)

Strained from all the exhaustion, Ganthos sits down in the cabin, relaxing.
He considers all the things that have passed, and all the things that will no doubt come. He unhooks the lightsaber he now caries at his belt, weighting it in his hand. HeÂ´ll have to ask one of the jedi to teach him how to use it one day.
(What is the color of the lightsabers blade? :P )

"There we will not be Jedi." Jace echoes under his breath. Images of his training, help innocents, meeting new friends, almost all of Jaces life, Sorka race through his mind all done through the force. Jace manages a low "Yes master Yu" before retiring to one of the bed chambers, there Jace sits in quite meditation. Jace would have no idea what to do with his life without the force, Jace has not known anything else. With a single tear on his check Jace meditates.
