# [Ripples in the Deep] C002 - The Second Ripple

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-13 10:56:49)

A fortnight has passed since the crash-landing, and things are not the same. They never will be.
Qur'aiden managed to jury-rig the engines, but the timing was too fine and the Sluuvath were already almost upon the vessel. Great tremors tore open the grassy plains, and the ship was knocked off-kilter, its supports buckling as it slid deep into the churning earth.
It had taken the combined might in the Force of everyone on board to prevent the vehicle from simply being crushed and pull it free to where its engines could be activated. And in the midst of the chaos valued friends were lost, respected masters and treasured apprentices both.
Talak fell from the cargo bay's entryway when the ramp, unclosed because of the crag lion corpse and its controls destroyed, fell open and tore away from the ship's frame. Himself near the entrance, the Nagaian master Kaito jumped, willingly following the apprentice down to the bowels of the planet in an effort to save him. As unlikely as it seems, they may yet live. Or they may already be dead - it was impossible to feel their life force among the onslaught of energy manifested by the oncoming Sluuvath, let alone know if it had ended.
Gunsan's life ended in a backwash of energy from the engines when the rear hull breached. As for the Wookiee master Orllovrllel, he gave his life heroically, remaining in the already compromised cargo bay and using the Force to prevent further breaches. He was crushed in the end by free-tumbling storage crates.
The ship itself only survived the physical stresses of the experience long enough to fly out of the path of destruction then crashed down a second time. When the rescue team arrived they found only four living sentients aboard, all unconscious and suffering from all manner of breaks and wounding.
The last two weeks have been spent in an intensive care wing of the Tras General Hospital. The Errant Knights have finally been discharged, but only after being informed that temporary accomodation has been arranged for them (paid for at the Salcuan Planetary Government's expense), their possessions (what could be retrieved from the crash site) have already been moved in, and further to all this the Prime Minister himself would like to meet them. A meeting has been arranged for 10 standard hours on the following morning.
For today though, their time is entirely their own. After such painful events, the mind-numbing possibilities of the cantina two floors down from their new high rise apartment block domiciles seem particularly attractive.

((OOC: Just to get back into the swing of things, post what your characters get up to in the evening before their meeting with the Prime Minister. After that we'll move the action along to the meeting itself and introduce new characters.))

The digging was tiring, arduous work, but T'iallo didn't mind. Living out in the Salcuan wildlands, the Firrerreoan master was no stranger to hard work or harrowing times.
He didn't know the Wookie, Nagaian, or the apprentices that were lost, and he had vague memories of their "introduction", but they were not who he dug the grave for. No, it was for the Crag Lions lost onboard the freighter as it spiraled into oblivion. Their deaths he felt most vividly, and he dug the grave by hand as penance for his weakness.
Sweat trickles down T'iallo's brow and stings where it encounters freshly puckered wounds, but he ignores them. The powerful Masters, as he now knew them after all that occurred, left powerful reminders on the Firrerreoans body, but he accepts them all as the price for a lack of vigilance. His mind roils as he goes over all the events that have lead him to Tras, dirt flying furiously as he piles it in great shovel-fulls.
***I know that this is not how you return to the Force, my friends, but I would not dishonor you by leaving you to rot amidst the wreckage. As all things of this land are welcome into its embrace, so shall you be, and give birth to life anew.***
It had taken the last of T'iallo's restraint when the mayor had dared to laugh when the Errant Knight had asked for a place to inter the Crag Lions, but he had been rather insistent and now had his plot, and his work before him.

Elashi followed her master as he went to entomb the craig lions in the plot. Understanding his bond with the lions she stands for a long time in silent support as he digs the hole with his bare hands. It is the only way she knows to support her master and understands that he has dubbed this his penance for his earlier lack of control. Their bond restored, she senses his emotional turmoil almost like it was her own, it's so strong. Eventually, she can no longer stand the emotional tide and she leaves, mentally asking forgiveness for her own weakness. She heads back to the apartment complex, the distance doing its work in helping to thin the strong emotions coming from T'iallo.
The noises from the cantina below the apartments proper stops her short. For a long moment she stares and blinks at the locale before taking approaching the doors to enter. Being around people again was energizing, and she realizes she missed the rush of energy from the people going about their lives, enjoying themselves. Approaching the bar, she hops up gracefully onto the bar stool and looks for the barman to take her order.

**"Karkin', sith-suckin', sonuva…"**
Qur'aiden curses as he works, but his heart isn't in it. The Nebula Blazer was all but totaled when the Sunbug crashed, but the spriggy Miralukan youth was able to salvage most of it. After their rescue, the Mayor of Tras had been kind enough to allot the boy a small parking garage near their new apartments in which he could work on his swoop.
He had Orllovrllel to thank for his baby still being alive. The Wookie had given his life to save Qur'aiden, to save them all, but that didn't make the orphan feel any less alone.
**"Dumb, stupid eight foot-tall throw rug. I hope he stubs his toe on the way back to the Force…"**
The joke provides small comfort, and the youths sad laugh is a poor mask for the sob he holds back. He scrubs his cloth-covered eyes with the back of his hand, and then grunts at himself in anger for the tears. Tears were for babies, and old ladies. He was a grown man, and going to be an Errant Knight to boot, he had no time for crying!
Taking up his hydrospanner, he takes out his frustration on a particularly stubborn portion of the bike's fairing, battering it back into place with a wiry fury.

The sound of Ketanna's boots echo on the pavement as she walks up the street back toward the apartment. After the weeks cooped up in the hospital it was nice to stretch her muscles for once. Now she had some way to relieve the sadness which filled her heart, or at least provide some other pain and distraction. Her feet now ached, having lost track of how long she had been walking. She stops outside the front doors of the apartment building, not the first time this day, but instead of walking through the front doors she turns and continues walking, her head lowered.
With her abdominal arms she pulls her cloak tighter, hiding their presence. To the average passersby she supposes she looks like a human, a deception she continually fosters. The comforting weight of her silverplasted discblades hang at her belt, in easy reach of her lower arms. *I've failed him. I rescued him from one adversary only to fall due to misadventure.* Her arms cross over her chest, clenching into fists. The sudden pain in her palms added to those in her feet and for a while longer the tears remained at bay. It was one thing to know that Talak had become one with the Force and another to accept it with grace. The fact her apprentice's body had been found, nor of Kaito the Master who had done what she should have and jumped after him.
Stopping suddenly, the Codru-ji woman stands outside the garage. She hears the frustrated banging and cursing of the young mechanic, Qur'aiden, the Wookie's apprentice. Weaving her way around the piles of debris, she looks upon the young man as he went about venting his grief and frustration of the remnants of his bike. Not interrupting or betraying her presence, she just stands and watches.

With a mad, childish cackle of glee, the Miralukan youth bends the piece of metal to his will and then takes a plasma torch from his tool kit and welds it back in place.
**"Well Quadzilla? You going to stand there holding up the door frame, or you going to come in? I may be blind, but I can still *feel* eyes on my back as well as anyone else!"**
Qur'aiden turns an insolent grin on the Errant Master, and then turns back to his work. The street urchin moves rapidly, but at second glance all of his movements are measured and precise as he tightens screws and replaces bolts. It is obvious the boy is good at what he does, even though his attitude all together is not.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With the last of the graves dug, T'iallo climbs out and scrabbles atop one of the mounds of dirt he had created, looking where the bodies of the dead Crag Lions lay. Raising both hands, he calls upon the Force, raising the corpses and gently interring them in their respective tombs. It takes several hours alone with just the one shovel, but the Firrerreoan manages to bury each one beneath the eaves of the massive Salcuan tree. Wielding his massive lightsaber, he deftly carves a memorial to the lions into the bark of the tree, then turns to go without a second glance.
T'iallo snatches up his helmet and tucks it under an arm as he begins the long walk back to the Tras outskirts. His mind in turmoil, he takes a moment to still his thoughts and reach out with his senses.
*Di'apa.*
He didn't know if his father survived the Sluuvath migration or not, but he was sure he would have felt the old man's death if it had come to pass. Still, he had not sensed his father through the Force since before their escape, and had felt no response since awakening in the hospital. Initially he had blamed the reason on whatever drug or poison that had coursed through his system, but now he was unsure.
Shrugging to himself, T'iallo continues his steady march back to the city. He pulls his shoulders back and lifts his chin, striding into the city like a soldier returning from war.

Ketanna steps into the workspace, finding an out of the way spot where she could still observe the young man as he worked. "**Quadzilla?**" she asks with a hint of bemusement. Qur'aiden's attitude was a bit refreshing from the usual reverent attitude other apprentices seemed to hold for other masters. "**In my opinion you're lacking some appendages. But I'll leave such deficiencies as a side effect of evolution.**"
Not having much of a knack for machines she watches as the youth proceeds with remarkable skill as he fixed up his bike. "**Are you going to be able to fix your vehicle?**"

The cantina is actually more of a trendy wine bar, well suited for the high class accommodations of the building. The wide room is lit by artfully shaped lamps sat atop the centre of round tables, which are themselves evenly spaced on a red carpeted floor that completely mutes Elashi's footfalls as she approaches the bar at the far end.
She takes a seat at the long tall counter and waits for one of the two bar staff to serve her. Presently, the female of the pair finishes serving a wealthy-looking Neimoidian and approaches.
'How can I serve you?' She asks, leaning her arms on the shining black counter-top and treating Elashi to a well-practised smile.
~~~~~
When T'iallo reaches out for the comforting touch of his father's presence in the Force, he is not disappointed. The familiar feeling is fleeting but unmistakeable. Andres Deisser still survives somewhere on the planet. With the touch comes the sense of a single word: "Calm".

Elashi shifts her weight as she glances about the wine bar. Knowing very little about wine in general, she ordered the first thing which came to mind. "Chimbak wine, please?" She recalled a thug mentioning it in the despot Talletle where she had spent her earlier years. As the barista goes about getting her glass of wine she glances around once more, her attention not settling on anything lest she be considered intrusive.

---

## Re: C002 - The Second Ripple

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-17 19:08:29)

'A good choice.'
The woman turns her back on Elashi, bending down to search for the appropriate bottle in the recesses below the counter.
The bar is starting to fill up, primarily with individuals who look affluent if not necessarily respectable. Presumably the majority of these customers are also residents in the block. The government really spared no expense to house them by putting them up in this building.
A few tables away some finely-clothed Sullustans are playing sabacc. Apparently for somewhat extravagant sums. A little further off in the other direction two Bothans and a Trandoshan lean close to discuss private matters.
The barista returns and pours a glass from the bottle of red Elashi specified.
'Are you paying now, or shall I charge it to your room's service tab?' she asks.

## Re: C002 - The Second Ripple

### **Alicia** (2010-01-17 19:25:46)

Her attention diverts back to the barista as the glass is placed in front of her. "Thank you. I will pay now." While she might have charged the government for the drink, she felt somewhat guilty about taking too much advantage of the government which had been most generous up till then. From a pouch she pulls out the credit chip she kept a small amount of her money on and hands it to the barista.
The young Cathar woman, while curious about her current surroundings, decides to mind her own business as she goes about tasting her first wine.

## Re: C002 - The Second Ripple

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-17 19:41:25)

Not that Elashi is particularly well-equipped to judge, but the Chimbak wine presented to her is rather excellent: a satisfactory vintage of what is already acknowledged a fine wine. Not a bad choice for an uninitiated wine appreciator.
The room continues to fill up around her as the evening inevitably moves on, and soon noise levels rise considerably. If "P" is "People" and "I" is "Inebriation", then **(P²) × I = B**, where "B" stands in place of "Bloody Noisy".
((Elashi is now short of 5 credits. Its an expensive bar, and a rather fine wine. :]))

"Yeah, yeah, four arms equals twice the ass-scratching goodness. Whatever you say lady."
Qur'aiden flops to his back amidst the strewn bits of metal and machinery, sliding underneath swoop bike while it rests on jack stands. He calls out from under the bike in his shrill voice, obviously holding something between his teeth as he does so.
"Nebby here'll run again, although it'll take more time'n we have right now. If I could git to a proper scrapyard, might have her swoopin' in a few days, but these stuffed shirts wouldn't know a scrapyard from great ant Orta. You want somethin'?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
T'iallo grunts to himself as Andres urges him to remain calm, but the grunt soon turns to a wry grin as he continues through the city toward their temporary residence. Tras was abuzz with activity, much of it due to the citizens returning home at the end of the work day as it slowly crept toward dusk. The whole thing threatens to make his head spin as T'iallo was much more use to the roars of the Salcuan wilderness rather than the screeching whine of hovercraft.
By the Firrerreoan's estimation, the whole thing was rather lively, but the wrong kind of lively. There was a constant aura of fear and anxiety surrounding Tras that would set any wild creatures teeth on edge, and T'iallo was no exception. The sooner their business here with the Prime Minister was finished the better, and the sooner he and his apprentice could return to prowling the plains.
So lost in these thoughts was the Errant Knight, that he nearly walks right past the hotel building. If it were not for light touch in the Force, the presence of Elashi within the building, he would have been lost amongst the maze of expensive eateries and high-rises that makes up this portion of Tras. With a silent toss of his head, he turns into the building making his way towards where he last sensed his apprentice.
When he first enters the cantina, his eyes lock on Elashi's back. After his recent encounter with foreign substances, T'iallo has taken a rather dim view on anything that would alter ones senses or state of being. That includes finely crafted wines in a swanky drinking establishment. Even more so if that swanky drinking establishment was rapidly filling with noise and undesirable sorts.
"Elashi, what are you doing here?"

## Re: C002 - The Second Ripple

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-17 20:01:03)

T'iallo is not so distracted by the confusions of the big city that his senses are worsened, and he realises while walking through the bar that the room contains a familiar face. One of the two Bothans at the table with a Trandoshan is known to the Firrerreo as the president of a property development firm, one Tiisk Byi'ra. They have clashed recently over an area that the Bothan's firm wishes to turn into an exclusive gated community. A plan that would destroy the habitats of countless thousands wild animals.
Through active protests and by pulling in a few favours owed to both he and his father, T'iallo has managed to stall the plan for the indefinite future.
Biy'ra seems to have noticed T'iallo too, as his narrow-eyed gaze follows the Errant Knight all the way to the bar. He mutters something to his companions, and the other Bothan leaves in a hurry.

## Re: C002 - The Second Ripple

### **Alicia** (2010-01-17 20:04:26)

Elashi looks up at T'iallo as he approaches, having sensed him as he drew closer. "**Oh! Master!**" she yells over the growing din. The glass in hand she takes a sip, a rather large sip. The glass was already half empty as she discovered she rather liked this wine stuff, a fact quite evident by the fact she was quickly growing more flush the more she drank. "**This is really good, Master. Would you like some?**"
-----------------------------------------------------
Ketanna shakes her head as he asks if she wanted something. "**Nothing**." Honestly she believed she was led here. Whether by her subconscious or the Force she had been drawn here. "**Would you like me to leave?**" she asks, almost wishing she hadn't for fear he would send her away. For once she wanted contact with another sentient being, especially as the current being was trying to work his way through his own loss.

---

## Re: C002 - The Second Ripple

### **Anazider** (2010-01-17 22:26:53)

T'iallo eyes the Bothan all the way out the door, a sneer curling his lips. The only thing that prevents him from advancing on Tiisk Byi'ra is his apprentice's rather rapid descent into insobriety. He rather impolitely crosses the room until he's standing in front of Elashi, his hands on his hips.
"No I would not like any, and you would not like any more either. Gather yourself, we are leaving for our chambers. Now."
Folding his arms across his chest, T'iallo stares his apprentice directly in the eye. His tone brooks no nonsense, and there is a tinge of anger to his words. He allows the young Cathar to set the wine glass down and come away with him without any prompting, but it is anyone's guess on just how long that will last.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Qur'aiden slides from under the swoop bike and sits up, turning to frown at the Codru-Ji master. He runs a grease stained hand through his shock of white hair, adding several unseemly black and grey highlights.
"Eh... Free galaxy, you can do what you want. Just hand me stuff when I ask fer it, and don't get in the way."
The Miralukan shakes his head, absolutely befuddled as to why Ketanna would want to hang around in the dank old garage with him, but he doesn't complain. He knew she had lost her apprentice as well, but it had always been his understanding that the Masters believed in the living Force, and weren't prone to feelings of sadness or pain.
Although to be fair, it was difficult to decipher a Wookies greater emotions (other than rage) from its need to release gas, so Qur'aiden wasn't quite sure he was a good judge of such things.
With another shake of his head, the frail mechanic flops back over and slides back under the suspended bike, intermittently asking Ketanna to hand him this tool or that part as he continues his work on the swoop.

## Re: C002 - The Second Ripple

### **Alicia** (2010-01-18 04:28:58)

The glass halts its journey to Elashi's lips as she brings it up to take another sip, her eyes widen in surprise as she picks up on the Firrerreoan's growing anger and the ferocity of the order. A part of her rebels at the order and she defiantly takes the sip she had paused in, before setting the glass down onto the counter. ***Why is he so upset… It was just a glass of wine.*** the young sixteen year old Cathar wonders. After all, she recalls her older brother drinking much worse when he had gone to parties. Slowly she stands from the bar stool, sliding down from the seat instead what would have usually been a gentle hop. She knows that these small acts of defiance would only infuriate T'iallo more, but the thought is quickly dismissed. Her sensibility being overcome by her bristling willfullness. ***When is he going to stop treating me like a child?*** It didn't occur, nor would it have mattered to her even if it had, that her own thoughts might have been evident through the link with her Firrerreoan master.
Now she stands next to the stool, the eye contact T'iallo initiated was never broken as she proceeded to do as he wanted, albeit slowly. Reaching back towards the counter, she retrieves her credit chip, now five credits less than what she had walked in with. On her feet, she begins to make her way slowly weave her way through the bar and to the lift which would take her back to the apartment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ketanna happily assists Qur'aiden as he continues about his work, glad for even the rather perverse company of the young mechanic. When not handing him tools, she leans against one of the nearby walls in an effort to relieve the increasing pain in her feet. Her eyes close as she listens to him working, the periodic banging and the sound of the tools themselves turning harmonic in a sense. At one point, she opens her eyes to hand him his desired part, a long pipe which she has no clue what purpose it serves on the bike, "**Did Orllovrllel teach you to use the discblade?**" she broaches, searching for some common ground on which to start a conversation. She never recalled the Wookie ever using more than his bare hands to attack his enemy, but again the answer wasn't so much the goal as conversation. Talking about the Miralukan's late master may also serve to ease some of the grief.

At five minutes to ten the Errant Knights are all present and correct in the outer offices of the Salcuan Prime Minister. The rooms display an opulence commensurate with the rank, and no expense seems spared in order to make them both luxuriously comfortable and psychologically intimidating.
Ketanna, T'iallo, Elashi and Qur'aiden are waiting on sofas that look and feel to be made of a soft leather, or a very convincing synthetic. Across an unnecessarily broad expanse of floor covered by a sumptuous patterned Quasrene rug, the Prime Minister's Cerean secretary
sits primly at her desk. The woman stares at the Knights with a curious intensity aseveryone in the room wait for the minutes to tick by.
Two minutes after the hour passes, the light of a tiny hologram appears on the secretary's desk.
'Please, send them in,' says the Prime Minister's little light-lattice replica before disappearing once more.
The Cerean sniffs disdainfully, but dutifully activates a control on her desk that opens the double doors to the inner office.
'The Prime Minister will see you now,' she confirms then removes her attention completely from the guests and focuses on the bureaucratic tasks otherwise expected of her.
After all four of the Errant Knights are through to the chamber beyond, the double doors swing firmly shut.
The office in which they find themselves is even more luxuriant than the outer room, sharing more in common with a study. The room is lined with shelving units which hold various items of both academic and esoteric interest value, including a collection of actual *books*. One wall is taken up by a small bar and a real fireplace, though the latter is unlit. At the far end of the office is the Prime Minister's desk, far larger and more imposing than the one belonging to his secretary. The entirety of the wall behind it is a screen displaying a panoramic view of the city. The whole room is lit ambiently, and a visitor could be forgiven for thinking the screen was genuinely a window letting in true sunlight.
The Prime Minister himself stands to greet them. A short, portly, friendly-faced man with surprisingly shrewd eyes, he looks to be firmly in the grip of middle-age.
'Come in do, make yourselves comfortable,' he insists, gesturing around at the plump chairs arrayed variously by the shelves, the fireplace, and in front of his desk, 'help yourselves to a drink if you like.'
He waits until they are settled, then continues.
'I understand that some of you are off-worlders, so allow me to introduce myself. I am Fenmun Teiain, Prime Minister of Salcu. I wish to express my sincere sorrow at your misfortune to be caught in the Sluuvath migration upon your arrival to our planet. As soon as I heard of your plight I immediately arranged for your hospital fees and accomodation to be covered. It seemed the least we could do.'
He pauses, looking at each of them, then presses a button on the console of a terminal built into his desk. The image on the screen behind him changes, and now appears to be displaying footage of hospital nurses sorting through items: their collective belongings.
Teiain watches the screen with them, then pauses the footage and zooms in on the short cylindrical object in a nurse's hands.
'If I am frank, I have subsequently learned a significant fact about you. Ladies and gentlemen, I recognise lightsabers when I see them.'
'Now,' he adds, leaning forward on his desk and steepling his fingers in front of his chin, 'I am not looking to make trouble. The political worries of the wider Galaxy are not yet on our metaphorical doorstep. You do not have to fear me selling you out. However, it occurs to me that you can be of great use on Salcu and in the Itara Cluster as a whole. There are many problems that plague our part of space, and I know it is the duty of a Jedi to help resolve such things. Consider it repayment of the favours I have done for you, if you want. Favours that you could continue to benefit from. We could be good allies to each other. Could we not?'

## Re: C002 - The Second Ripple

### **Anazider** (2010-01-20 23:37:54)

As prime minister Teiain speaks, T'iallo's frown grows deeper and deeper until he is wearing an outright sneer.
**"I do not fear these… *Sith*, and I doubt you are so ready to wrap a yoke around the neck of the system, or at least I hope you are. I would hear of this task first before I storm from your office and take my chances on the highlands."**
Setting his feet, the Errant Knight folds his forearms across his chest and stares directly at the rotund little man, instantly taking a disliking to the prime minister. The Firrerreo cares little for politics, and politicians for that matter, but he knows something of the troubles facing the greater galaxy, and his father had been heavy-handed in his warnings against the Sith and what their arrival would spell for the Salcuans. He stands awaiting Teiain's reply, his sneer ever present.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It doesn't take Qur'aiden's finely honed street sense to know when he was being strong-armed into a deal, and if there was one thing the Miralukan knows well is that if you submit to a bully once, your his until you stand up for yourself or he gets bored.
And bullies never get bored.
**"Yeah, tall, shiny, and angry over there 'as a point. I can smell a grift from two parsecs, and this is whiffin' of yesterday's unwashed Bantha."**
Not completely forgetting himself, the youth looks to Ketanna for her input, expecting complete agreement over any sort of master-to-apprentice guidance.

## Re: C002 - The Second Ripple

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-22 11:55:05)

Teiain shakes his head in evident disappointment at the attitudes of the Jedi.
'Then you are more naive than I had hoped. T'iallo, perhaps you don't keep abreast of the current events outside your sphere of interest, but I do. I have to. You may not know all the Sith are capable of: their destruction of the Jedi Order, their domination of the Galaxy, and their crushing of planets that oppose them. I suspect the pair of you I know to be from the beyond the Cluster can confirm these facts to your land-locked comrades.'
His intense gaze focuses on the gold-skinned Errant Master. When looking into those eyes it is easy to see how this physically unimpressive man has managed to become the leading political figure on Salcu.
'Make no mistake,' he continues, 'you have every reason to fear the Sith. And you have every reason to fear their coming to the Itara Cluster. It is simply a matter of time. When they do, I can honestly say that we will not be able to fight against the resources at their disposal.
'You may have seen the terms of my offer as an implied threat. Honestly, I don't care if you do. But I wish for you to fully consider the benefits of accepting. You will definitely benefit from allies in political office. When the Sith come I can give you early warning and help you to hide. In the interim, I can keep providing you the comforts and resources that have been at your disposal since you left hospital. All I am asking in return is that you do what I know is normally the duty of a Jedi: that you act to protect the interests and lives of our citizens. Surely there is no loss in the arrangement for noble Jedi Knights?'
He pauses, sighs, and pinches the bridge of his nose. Suddenly the shroud of power is dropped and the short, portly, thinning-haired individual underneath is evident for all to see. He may be a powerful man, but he is just one man, and his reponsibilities obviously weigh heavily.
'Look T'iallo, I wonder if you are more aware of events within the Cluster than you are of those without. Do you know that we are plagued by pirates, terrorists, and other criminals? Do you know that our crime-rates are rising with the passage of each year? Do you perhaps know that some unknown group is even kidnapping children - *children!* - from their homes? Make no mistake, the worlds of our Cluster are plagued by a deep rot that is probably even more dangerous than the Sith, and is certainly more immediate. If you doubt me still I can even provide the statistics to prove it. You are Jedi. You have abilities that our police forces cannot bring to bear no matter how many resources we channel their way. You can *help*.'
~~~~~
In the outer office, four other individuals gather for their arranged meeting with the Prime Minister. Under the watchful and disapproving gaze of his secretary, each arrives in turn and is informed to wait until the occupants of the inner office are ready to see them.

Chain arrives at the office shortly after the doors close for the others. The human decides to sit down as the secretary informs him that he must wait until the Prime Minister is ready for his presence.
Chain Karath is a 26 year old human, with shaggy dark brown hair that rests on the tips of his shoulders. His skin is a plaler shade of white, when contrasted against the black cloth that makes up his robes and guantlets. He wears his hood over his face to hide the mosaic eyes that bear scars of many missions that gave him injuries.
*I arrive on time and I'm forced to wait…what a kriffing way to do such a thing!* Chain's inner voice spoke into his head.
Not being of nobility, Chain stretches back into the chair provided for him, gets comfortable, and waits for the door to open and for his time to speak with the Prime Minister.
A vigilante's work was never done, and Chain was no exception. He arrived on the planet a full standard week ago, taking tips from those who had lived here for years about the grounds, the criminals, and the strange occurences that took place around the city. He was still in shock about the strange Sluuvath accident that had happened shortly after he arrived here.
He hopes that the Prime Minister will assist him with the credits he needs to advance his combative abilities, because Chain hungers to defeat the Sith, and coming to the Ithara Cluster would be a waste if all he managed to do was put some spice dealers like Charanga or Mutamo away for a while.

The should of heavy armored feat echoed though the corridor, as Tracinya Mereel paced in the antichamber awaiting the Prime Minister. The fire motive carved into her heavy beskar'gam seemed to waver as she moved. The Jensaari didn't like being told to wait.
Finally she pulls off her helmet and sets it down on the secretaries desk, then she pulls off her gauntlets and throw them down beside the buy'ce. "And how much longer am i going to be forced to wait? I remind you that I'm under no obligation to remain here."
Tracinya wasn't even sure what was what had brought her here to be honest. Finally she settled down in a chair, and breathed calmly. Letting the Force calm her frustration. Whatever happened, would be the will of the Force.

As Ged walks towards the small room outside the Prime Ministers office, he notice the young human male sitting in a chair. Given that his looks were not something you saw every day, the warrior suspects that they were there for the same reason. Whatever that reason now was, since he had yet to see the Prime Minister.
As he enters the office, he sees something else he didn´t see every day. Sitting in another chair was a Mandalorian woman. He hoped his discomfort didn´t show through his armor. Although it had been years since his exile, he still felt a little uneasy around those he used to call his kin. He wasn´t sure how far the rumors of his exile had spread, but in the years since, he suspected that every son and daughter of Mandalore knew of the wandering warrior who had lost his soul.
He wasn´t that very hard to recognize for them either. He wore armor based on an archaic design, from the times were the Mandalorians fought and died in service of Exar Kun and nearly laid the Galaxy at their feet. He carried a massive blade twice the size of the normal Mandalorian saber. And on his left shoulderplate was etched the *resol'nare*, the moral code of the Mandalorians. No, if she had heard about his exile, she would recognize him.
Walking past the sitting man, Ged offers a small nod, barely visible through the features of his armor. As he passes the woman, he halts for a moment.
"Well met, *ner vod*"
In silence, he moves on to stand in the corner of the room, leaning his rifle against the wall. Seeing the woman made him think of things he hadn´t thought of in a long time. Of how he had lost his heart and soul in battle, and of how he had been cast out because of it. But he had changed, he knew it, and one day he would return to Mandalore.

"Ne shab'rud'ni, aruetii." Tracinya says to the exile without hesitation and without even turning her head or opening her eyes. Yes she knows of him, and like any proper Mandalorian she would have nothing to do with him.
Once again she will focus on meditation. Once more awaiting the call of the Prime Minister. She is as much a Jensaari Defender now as she was a member of the Mando'a. As such, she wouldn't engage in violence unless he became a threat.

Impossible to tell through his helmet, Ged didn´t move a muscle at the insult. He had expected something like that, although perhaps not as strong an accusation as being called *aruetii*. Still, he figured that he deserved it, and for a moment, he felt the memories of the past coming back to him, of what had become and done.
*No, that is the past, and not who you are anymore…*
He shifted his weight from one leg to the other, and continued to wait in silence. He knew he had changed, but he would need to prove it to his people before he would be one of them again.

**"I have battled all manner of threats here on Salcu and across the Cluster. Threats that the citizens must often times face *alone*, for fear that their pleas fall upon the deaf ears of their governors. I *know* what the people face."**
T'iallo leers over the pudgy little man and then snorts as he turns and stalks a few paces away. Talk of luxuries and "favors" serves only to further incense the Firrerreoan, but it is when Teiain appeals to the Errant Knight's sense of honor and duty to the Itaran people does T'iallo begin to relent.
**"You are not speaking to simpering bureaucrats or idiot dignitaries. I neither want, nor need, your enticements; speak plainly of your request and…"**
Taking a deep breath he turns back around to eye the prime minister.
**"I will *consider* what must be done."**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**"Speak fer yourself Tin Skin, I'd like to hear about these *enticements*."**
Qur'aiden mostly zones out as the Prime Minister Teiain goes on his tirade, but when it comes to payment, the orphan hears loud and clear. He rubs his hands together as the politician hints at the rewards, the youth's mind running rampant.

Last through the doors of the Prime Minister’s office, Taran is less than enthused by the sight waiting in the antechamber.
He strides in with the easy elegance of his birthright, a leader of predators. He wears only partial armor to this meeting, meaning to put his host at ease. Chest and back plates, pauldrons, oversized gauntlets and boots are all the armor he allowed himself when meeting what the galaxy called “politicians”. The only article of his ensemble that does not share the odd mixture of beauty and practicality is his robe. A simple thing, it does not hinder his movements and could more accurately be described as a tunic. On close inspection the robe makes up for its lack of functionality with its understated excellence; it is white, with soft textures that depict a snowstorm ravaging a mountainside. This together with the armor, pale grey detailed with silver scrollwork, and his black thinsuit, which serves as contrast and color-break, accent and emphasize his easy confidence and face. While he will never be called handsome, few are the beings that do not find him striking.
The pale skin of his smooth-shaven skull glints in the lighting, given sharp contrast by his dark brows and small close-trimmed mustache and goatee. His pale blue eyes bypass his fellows to fix upon the secretary. When he speaks, his unnaturally deep voice flows to all corners of the room, simultaneously caressing and suffocating:
“You will inform the Prime Minister of my arrival. You will tell him Lord Braynon wishes to speak to him, and you will do so now.”

Ketanna up to this point had been observing the conversation between the Minister and T'iallo. While she was willing to help the minister and the people of Sulca the fact he was trying to blackmail into assisting him was making her angry. Sitting at the edge of the chair provided for her, she reaches to Qur'aiden with on hand indicating to that was enough. It makes her wonder what sort of life he had with his Wookie Master as he is now so eager to sell his services for his own sake and not for those who need his help. She makes a note to have a talk with her new apprentice on the matter.
"**I have traveled the galaxy and I have no fear of the Sith. Had you approached this in a different manner then we would be more willing to assist you. But you approached as mercenariness. Those who would sell their skills for the sake of wealth and favors.**" With a look at Qur'aiden she makes sure that the message is clear to him as well. "**That we are not.**" Her attention turns back to the minister. "**Nor are we frightened of your threat, implied or not, you are blackmailing us with the fact the Sith seek to eliminate us. While you believe your polical connections may provide us succor, if the Sith want us they will be as Kath hounds on the sent.**"
She brings her hands to rest in her lap, a simple gesture to show her at ease in this situation. "**We are thankful for what you have done for us, and we would be willing to assist in what way we can provided the mission is in the best interest of the people. I am with T'iallo when I say for you to speak plainly and we will see how we can assist. Not every problem can be solved by a Jedi, but we would be willing to advice you in the best solution.**" She nods over to the other Errant Master, hoping her own tirade had given the time he needed to collect himself. Anger she knows is not the best course when dealing with headstrong political leaders.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Elashi had stood next to T'iallo taking her cues from her master, especially after her apparent disappointment she had caused the previous night in the wine bar. Her hands rest behind her back as she listens to the ministers tirade knowing full well her master would not take kindly to such matters, his scope only encompassing the settlement where they had lived and the protection of the Craig Lions. Unlike her master, she had a better view of what laid outside the plains where they lived. She winces when she hears children were still being taken as slaves. Such a fate she didn't wish on anyone, let alone children. While she had been tricked into slavery, these children had been taken from their homes. While she had nothing then, these children still had their families. Someone waiting for them.
She didn't need to look at him to know the minister had crossed a line when speaking to T'iallo, she could sense it and hear it in his voice as he spoke. Pleadingly, she turns to look at T'iallo as his anger grew. She prays that his anger would cool quickly so his mind would not be clouded by it, she also hopes that he will listen and decide that they can be of use to others beside their small community.

In the outer office, the secretary responds haughtily to the various comments made, explaining in clipped tones that "The Prime Minister is a very busy man with the affairs of an entire planet to manage, and surely must be forgiven if one of his many appointments overruns."
She quails under Taran's stare and becomes notably politer, but still refuses to call through to the Prime Minister.
'I am sorry that you are being kept waiting,' she says, 'but I have had precise instructions that the Prime Minister will call you through when ready and I will not diverge from them. It should only be a few minutes more.'
~~~~~
The Prime Minister does not seem particularly impressed by Ketanna's words. His point of contention becomes very clear when he replies:
'My dear lady, I *never* attempted blackmail. Replay the conversation and you will find it so: to have done so I would have had to threaten revealing you to the Sith which is a threat I never made. In fact all I ever said was that I didn't care if you had taken my offer as an implied threat. It does not necessarily follow that it was a threat in the first place.'
Teiain shakes his head sadly.
'It is ever the way in politics. You try to do what is best, and in the course of that perhaps you approach some matters with stronger tactics than were necessary but you do it for the right reasons. Yet the people will still find a way to make you the bad guy. At this point it would soothe my mind to correct a few of your other errors and indeed to call your bluff, but I see that matching myself in a game of wit with you will not prove productive. Let us therefore get down to business, if you will forgive a word with implications of transaction.'
Reaching across his desk, Teiain presses the inbuilt console screen several times and speaks:
'Please send in my other visitors.'
~~~~~
'Please send in my other visitors,' a man's voice suddenly emanates from the secretary's desk.
'Certainly Prime Minister,' the owner of that desk replies before addressing those in the room: 'it is time.'
The door to the inner room opens enabling their entrance to join the discussions within.
'I do apologise that you have been kept waiting,' says the man who is presumably the Prime Minister from his seat at the far end of the room, 'I had hoped to complete a preliminary discussion before you arrived but it proved less simple than I supposed.'

His steps contain their usual easy grace as he enters the Prime Minister’s office. The group of people before the desk seems almost as motley as the one in the antechamber. He lowers his voice a touch, knowing how its depth carries it easily—
**“Prime Minister, your servant has a persistence that some mountains would envy. I imagine she could make a rabid Varg sit still while its dinner was prepared. I may hire her away from you, when this is concluded.”**
Taran allows the room’s superb acoustics to finish with his voice’s last echoes before he crosses the room, taking stock of positions and appearances as he goes, to the view pane displaying the city. His eyes rove at leisure over the panorama, betraying nothing. His mind, on the other hand, is analyzing the people in the room.
One, fully armored and of an unknown breed with pride radiating out from him like heat from a fire, stands as if awaiting a reason to do murder or storm from the room. Another sits, seeming much more at ease with the situation. Then the fact that she has four arms comes to the forefront, though Taran is far to disciplined to show it. He resolves to find out what her species is called. The third is, oddly enough, a blind youth. The fourth, a maiden, of yet another species unknown to Taran, whose predatorial heritage and pleasing appearance manage to hold his attention longest. Of course, even the keenest observer would have trouble determining whether he is simply admiring the view of the city, planning how best to conquer it, or how to defend it.

Glad to see the doors to the Prime Ministers office finally open, Ged grabbed his rifle from where he had leaned it against the wall, and walked into the room. He didn´t pay much attention to the last newcomer, even though the man´s voice was quite powerful and hard to shut out, and he also seemed to be quite fond of hearing it.
Instead he looks around inside the office. It looks pretty much like he had expected it to be, although he had never been inside a lot of offices belonging to important people before. Well, not in any kind of office in fact, except for maybe once or twice. He was a simple man, and enjoyed it best that way. But he´d never hold it against anyone if they liked luxury.
Finally he settles his eyes on the four other people in the room, besides the Prime Minister. They seemed like a quite diverse group, and he wonders who they could be. Some sort of clue enters into his head though, as he looks at the Cathar female. Oh, yes, he knew the Cathar species, every Mandalorian who knew something about their history did. Kind of hard to forget a species you were believed to have exterminated millenia ago. But more interesting, she had a lightsaber hanging at her side. Now that was interesting. But he was sure it would all be revealed who they were and what they were doing here.
Without removing his helmet, he turns back to the Prime Minister.
"So, minister, why have we been called here?"
For his own sake, he knew the question was quite moot. Throughout history, there had usually only been a single reason anyone hired Mandalorian mercenaries.

Tracinya was in no rush to enter the Prime Ministers chamber, First reclaiming her gauntlets from the Secretaries desk, and butting both them and her helmet back on and sealed.
Shaking her head disapprovingly, at the noble youth as he wasted time speaking of unimportant things. And as she passed him, she lightly cuffed him on the back of the head. Then silently found herself a place to sit.
She looked over the four people in the room with the Prime Minister, and the Force told her all she needed to know about them. They were all sensitive to the Force. That made two of them Masters of their Way, and the others two apprentices.

T'iallo turns to regard the double doors that lead into the Prime Ministers office, as a trio of newcomers enter. With his eyes folded across his chest and his gaze-level, the golden-skinned master looks upon the three as they present themselves like a pride leader would upon three rogues seeking entrance to his domain.
"More 'allies' Teiain? Have you some incriminating bit to dangle above them, or are they here for the comfort and hospitality?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Qur'aiden crosses his arms in a pout, but remains silent. He still doesn't fully trust teh four-armed master, and if she thought that she would be able to rein him in she was highly mistaken, but he understood that this was one of those times where his silence may be more beneficial than his incredible wisdom.
*What, was there a sale on cheap-crete on the way over? You'd think we were going to go storm Impster Prime.* The youth chuckles at his own joke as he watches the parade. The one that speaks properly and walks around with his nose in the air earns an instant snort of disgust from the street urchin, as he remembers some of the dandies that would frequent the Warrens in search of "sport".

Elisha looks back at the door as well as the newcomers enter. Moving to T'iallo's side she regards them with mild interest. As the armored man looks around the room, she gets the feeling his interest lingers on her the longest. Moving deeper into T'iallo's shadow she tries to remove herself from his curious gaze. The site of the armor, however, draws her attention. Somewhere she recognizes its design, but can't seem to place it. Biting her lip nervously, she keeps her peace as they in turn speak to the minister.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ketenna doesn't turn her head as the door opens to reveal the three in the outer room; instead her gaze remains on the minister. She wonders what the minister is up to bringing other into this. "**T'iallo, you let your anger get the better of you,**" she remarks off handedly to him. **"The minister has yet to reveal his hand.**" Finally she looks up at the three newcomers taking in their appearance. Still perched at ease on the proffered chair, her two lower arms and a hint of silver are hidden under her cloak to all but the most observant, her other two hands rest at ease in her lap.
With her inspection of the newcomers complete, her gaze returns to the minister waiting for him to get on with the business at hand.

The barest brush of gauntleted hand across the back of his head left Taran in confusion.
*What meaning could this touch have? Were it insult, surely it would have been harder. Not even one of the famed Mandolorian warriors would be so stupid as to instigate violence in the office of their employer, so that couldn’t be it.*
He remembered having heard of strange societies where such displays were displays of affection.
*Only that makes any sense. The poor dear undoubtedly finds me attractive. Unfortunately, she is common, and a touch too old for my bed. Tis best I tell her now, and save her any further embarrassment. Should I trust her to understand subtle hints? No, it is best to be blunt and avoid any misunderstandings or unpleasantries.*
Taran places large doses of contempt and disdain in his voice in the hopes she will not simply think him playing hard to get.
**“No offense intended, Mandolorian, but I have no wish to mate with you. You are past proper child bearing age, and not of suitable blood.”**
The proud one turns and Taran sees the lion motif of his armor.
*Could I possibly have a kindred spirit here, amongst politicians and simple Mandolorians?*
After he speaks of ‘incriminating bits’ Taran is almost certain. He removes the disdain and contempt from his voice before addressing the one called T’iallo,
**“I am Taran of house Brayon, royal seat of the Hedd system. The Prime Minister here may wish us allies, or he may be content with competitors. I presume the challenge presented by our prey will decide. That is why I am here. Not hospitality or blackmail, but to test and improve my skills while aiding those less fortunate. To Hunt.”**

Chain's inner child is getting a kick out of the "noble", who struts into the office and insults the madalorian with remarks about her "child bearing age".
The man smiles, despite his drawn hood, towards the scene taking place. He is the only one who waits a resonable distance from the crowd already in the room, and his own ragtag group, before bowing towards the Prime Minister.
*Heavens help us, whatever this man wants us to do.* Chain thinks to himself.
Chain looks at the group already assembled in the room and something catches his eye: lightsabers. *These creatures must be Jedi*, he thought, *because Sith don't act this calm…*
The man pushes countless thoughts back down to the bottom of his mind, as they fight with their sharp echos to control his attention. All of the missions he has completed, all the ones left unmentioned. He once was a Sith, but is today, the faintest memory of the Dark Side.
Chain feels the Force within the room, and takes notice of the energy of the Light Side. *These Jedi must have some importance to the Prime Minister to not be turned in like Banthas to the slaughter…but what exactly?* Chain thinks.

Ged mused under the cover of his helmet. Other cultures might find it appropriate for a male to stand up for a female, but not Mandalorians. And he had decided to tread lightly in his social interactions with the woman, as she seemed to hold a pretty set opinion about him already, no doubt based upon the rumors surrounding his exile. It would take both actions and words, he supposed, to change that. But in all fairness, he decided to give the "nobleman" a warning.

The Prime Minister allows the interactions of those gathered to pass for a minute or two, his eyes glazing in a way that suggests that even *he* is beginning to rethink the advisability of his scheme (whatever it may be).
'You are all here, *despite what some of you may think*,' he speaks up after a short while, directing his gaze rather pointedly at T'iallo as he does so, 'because you are either new to the system or have otherwise largely remained out of the public eye. You are also here because I know you all to be skilled individuals in your fields. These facts make you potentially valuable asssets.'
Using his desk console, Teiain activates a montage of footage which appears on the screen above him and cycles through scene after terrible scene: the aftermath of a pirate attack on a group of transports; the scene of a gang battle inside a now-devastated cantina; a hospital ward where drug-addicted youths of many species lie in various states bodily and mental dysfunction; news reports featuring crying parents begging for their children to be returned home.
'This city, this planet, indeed this entire Cluster are beset with problems. The foundations on which our society is built suffer a deep rot. Our police do the best they can, but lately it seems as though they cannot stop this tide of criminality, and its forces seem to grow ever stronger. You, as talented and powerful individuals who are relative unknowns among our enemies, are rather uniquely placed to assist our efforts to stem the tide. If you are willing. I would like for you to become members of a task force dedicated to rooting out the causes of these problems and bringing them to justice. Or if necessary, to eliminate them. The role may necessarily involve infiltration of whatever organisations are at fault.
'If you agree to take on the position, comfortable quarters and living expenses would be covered and you would receive generous bonuses based on the nature and risks of any jobs undertaken.'
'And for those with more charitable hearts,' he adds with a small smile, looking again at T'iallo, 'you even have the option of working *pro bono*.'

"If I desired to mate with you boy. You wouldn't be given an option." Tracinya replied to the nobleman. Vahl were a matriarchal society, and a touch of that still effected her thoughts even though she was fully a Mandalorian and Jensaari now. Her tone made it clear that that what she said next wasn't a simple suggestion. "Since your blue blood apparently doesn't carry enough oxygen to your brain, Remain Silent."
The female mandalorian then feel silent once again, making a note that the next time the man spoke, to just disembowel him and be done with it.
She listened to what the Prime Minister had to say, "I won't work with the *aruetii*, or the Imbecile."

Shaking his head slightly, Ged wonders how long the young fool will have his head and body still attached to each other unless he learns to keep that big mouth of his shut every once in a while. He had a feeling that working with the man might make him want to aid in the process of separating them.
Still, the offer made by the Prime Minister was a good one, and for a just cause nonetheless.
"I´m in. Hopefully we´ll find a way to brighten the future of this cluster and its people"
Turning his head slightly to look at Tracinya, he added.

T'iallo looks from the Codru-Jii master, to the Fop, and then to the Prime Minister, his lip curling as he set upon from all sides. With a grunt he nods stiffly, his armored hands balling into fists beneath his arms as he crosses them even more tightly over his chest. He plants his feet firmly and squares his chest for anyone that would question him or his motives.
**"We will do what must be done. For Salcu, and all Itarans. Bestow your rewards on those that need them, or are enamored with such."**
With one last look at Taran and the Mandalorians, he focuses fully on the dowdy little man in their midst.

Ketanna nods her agreement with T'iallo's words. Then with a glance over at her apprentice she adds, "**There is not much we require.**" It was obvious to her how the young man would spend the bulk of his funds and she couldn't think of another way to help him rebuild his precious speeder. The thoughts of acquiring a ship of their own for the day when they would have to move on was present as well, but it was too soon to discuss an inevitability.
Looking at the others around her, she gauges their reactions with her first impressions. Obviously the others the minister had gathered here were intended to compose the team they would work within. Already there seemed to be some dissension. Her gaze lingers over the two Mandalorians before moving to the cloaked man. There is something about him she doesn't trust. A feeling she takes note of, but decides to do nothing except be vigilant.

'I would rather speak to you about these arrangements in private,' Chain says, glancing around, 'I have a few concerns that may need addressing.'
'Very well, if you insist,' replies the Prime Minister, 'then I suppose you might as well leave for now. Ask my secretary to arrange for another appointment to be made as soon as possible.'
Nodding his understanding, Chain exits the room. Teiain waits until the door closes behind him before speaking again.
'Well, this hasn't gone perfectly to plan, but at least we've made a start of it.'
He looks at Tracinya and addresses her: 'My dear, I'm afraid that I have now entered into a verbal contract with these people you find disagreeable.

Tracinya didn't waste any time, standing up and leaving the room. She didn't waste any words either, as from her point of view things were extremely simple. She wasn't going to place herself at risk, by relying upon people that were clearly unreliable.

'I have been in discussions with the Salcuan Policing Authority,' Teiain continues as though nothing has happened to interrupt the meeting, 'and we are going to make you members of a special unit. I want to stress to you at this point that the name and nature of this unit is kept secret for reasons of security. The need for such secrecy is something we all in this room understand the significance of, I think.'
He smiles guardedly, sitting back in his chair. The Prime Minister seems somewhat more relaxed now that the significant portion of the meeting is over with.
'I am authorised to tell you this much: as members of this unit you will have powers and responsibilities unlike those of a mere police officer. Your investigations will be separate, but you will have access to the resources of the SPA should you require them. You will also have the power to requisition from the citizenry if necessary during your missions. If our little experiment proves successful, it will soon grow so that you will be able to investigate crimes occurring on other worlds.'
At this point Teiain pulls down the collar of his shirt, revealing a fine metal chain around his neck. He pulls the chain up and over his head, and takes the attached key in his right hand. The key is used to unlock a drawer in his desk, from which the Prime Minister takes four small memory units and places them on the edge of the desk within easy reach for his guests.
'You will receive an encrypted message tonight: these contain the routines that will reveal the contents as well as a scrambler file. You are to make your way to the address given tomorrow morning: try to be prompt at nine. After memorising the address, activate the scrambler to destroy all trace of the message as well as the contents of these memory units. Well, that's it, ladies and gentlemen. I thank you for your time.'

Ged watches Tracinya get up and leave. He could certainly understand her reasons, even though he thought them rash and full of prejudice. But maybe this is how it will be, he thinks to himself, and wonders if he will ever be able to escape his past.
He listens carefully to what the Prime Minister has to say. Being part of a small operations unit is nothing new to him, that´s how he has lived most his life. He does, however, hold a deep dislike for politics, and the scheming, immoral and corruption he associates with it. So far he hasn´t seen anything that would make him question the Prime Ministers motives, and he agrees with the notion that such a unit could surely become highly effective against criminal activities in the area.
He picks up one of the small memory units from the desk, casually inspecting it, but paying it no greater attention.
"Very well Prime Minister, I shall be awaiting the message then"
Stuffing the unit in his belt, the warrior picks up his rifle from where he had out it down for the meeting, and leaves the room. Now, he figures as he heads out into the city, he should try to find someplace to rest.

T'iallo takes one of the memory devices from the desk and holds it up to stare at it. He then grunts and shakes his head to himself, tossing the memory unit over his shoulder to Elashi before turning on a heel and prowling out of the door.
The look he gives the receptionist and the various functionaries filling the halls of the Prime Minister's office stops them cold in their tracks. Not looking over his shoulder, the Errant Knight speaks to Elashi as his eyes rove the various corridors looking for any sign of a hidden threat.
**"What are your thoughts Elashi? Teiain *reeked* of obsequiousness; all he knows is the politicians double-speak, although there is some good to be had here. I can see now that this will be something I will not merely overpower, and as such will greatly require your insight."**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Donate to charity, huh?* *Now I* know *I hate this guy.*
Qur'aiden grouses in his seat as the nobleman spouts his credentials and produces his list of 'worthwhile' donations. He grumbles to himself as the Mandalorian chick storms out, and looks to his Codru-Jii master as the data devices are produced.

Elashi catches the tossed chip with ease in one hand, her taloned fingers enclosing the small chip in her grip. As T'iallo moves past her she gives the minister a slight bow before she follows behind him, glancing at the other members of the team as she does so.
With T'iallo setting the pace out, she tosses anyone unlucky enough to catch sight of her master an apologetic smile. As they leave the building she sets her pace so she walks beside him. "**I too think a great deal can be done**." she pauses a moment as they turn a corner and she has to quicken her step to keep beside him. **"I think he spoke rather plainly at the end, there's only so much which can be told at such a meeting. He's right when he says that the police force themselves can't handle the sort of problems they face. They may even be corrupt.**"
====================================================
Ketanna nods to Qur'aiden indicating that he could take it. Since the meeting was now over so she stands, nodding casually to the other occupants in the room. **"Until then**," she says and like T'iallo turns on her heel and heads out of the room. Standing outside of the office door for Qur'aiden to follow. Setting a leisurely pace, she begins the return trip back to the apartments and Qur'aiden's garage. The route she takes, take them right by the entrance to the garage, where she guessed he would be heading next.
'**How do the repairs to your bike progress?**" she asks off handedly as they walk. Thoughts concerning the meeting filter through her mind as she contemplates the connotations of what they were getting into. The master glances at him for a moment. Besides his earlier outburst at the onslaught, he had been quiet through the rest of the meeting which makes her wonder what he thought of the whole thing.

Taran watches as the others claim their chips and leave.
**"Fenmun, my friend, have I told you the tale of the boy who took a Varg by the tail? No?"** he asks.
**"In my system, the Varg are our allies. They hunt with us and war with us,"** Taran explains before beginning the tale.
**"There once was a boy who found a Varg pup on the slopes above his village. This boy was convinced that with this Varg all his problems would be solved. He took the Varg by the tail, and subsequently lost his arm. On returning home, almost dead, he complained to his parents of the encounter. They told him that the Varg are to be respected and not trifled with. They also told him he should have listened when they taught him the First Law- 'If you cannot kill it, leave it be'. As you can imagine the boy then died of his wounds."**
**"Let us hope, my friend, that you haven't forgotten the First Law and taken a Varg by the tail, shall we? Good day."**
Taran takes his chip and leaves, pondering the coming hunt, and his odd newfound allies.

**"Of course they are! Such has been evident for quite some time now, although I suspect now Itara's problems have been delivered to Teiain's doorstep."**
T'iallo growls his words to Elashi at his side, but now most of the heat has gone from his voice. His eyes continue to rove the surrounding cityscape as they make their way back to the apartments, but now his stride relaxes somewhat.
**"And what of our would-be comarades? I owe Ketanna and her ward a debt for my transgressions,"** his grip upon his helmet tightens briefly before he consciously loosens it, **"And we are of the same order, after a fashion. But the other warrior and the foppish youth concern me…"**
He turns his head slightly to peer at the young Cathar, his eyebrow quirking in askance.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Qur'aiden bumps table as he stands, drawing attention as he smiles in sheepish apology. When he turns to trail after his master, the memory device is gone, and it is a wonder just how quickly the urchin managed to pocket it.
**"Wha, Nebby? She's a'ight. Be even more a'ight if we were a little more needful with our reward takin', eh?"**
The cloth covering the Mira'lukan's eyes crinkles as he squints up at his master. He shoves his hands into his pockets, the storage device along with them, and strolls right along with Ketanna, whistling a song a boy his age has no business whistling.

Ketanna glances at her young companions with a small smile. "**If you recall, I didn't turn down the payment. I fully intended for it to be used to help repair your bike as well as work toward future transport should we ever need to leave.**" Her gaze turns back to where she is walking as she continues on. "**We can decide what to do with surplus when the time comes.**" Turning her head, she looks around and then starts walking in another direction away from the apartments.
It was nice to walk and stretch her legs and the thought of heading back to the apartments didn't appeal to her. "**I'm heading to the market**," she says deciding where she was actually heading. It was nearing late afternoon and the curiosities of what goods these people may value appealed to her. If she was going to help in protecting them she wanted to learn more about them. She looks back at Qur'aiden, her glance asking if he was joining her.
=======================================================================
"**The Mandalorian and the loud mouth noble**." Elashi states as she follows along to his right. Her pace slows slightly as she considers them, remembering the feeling they both had stared at her longer than was necessary. With a shrug she hides the shudder at the thought of being around a Mandalorian. Her parents last stories had been about them as they traveled to Cathar on their pilgrimage, illustrating with pictures from a historical text they carried with them. What did it mean that this Mandalorian wore the same archaic style used during their conquests?
"**I didn't really get a good feel for them, but the minister must think highly of them if they were offered a position within his special task force**," she offers at last, knowing her master didn't think very highly of the minister.

Ged easily finds a suitable place to bunk down for the night in relative comfort and security.
Ketanna meanwhile learns that the people of Salcu are much like people anywhere: what they mostly want amounts to food and other essentials for living, but the economy thrives also on their need to possess items that help tie them to their sense of self. The same sorts of designer goods; art objects; nick-knacks; and cultural items might easily be found, or have an analogue to be found, on any planet. While walking she does encounter evidence of the societal degradation the Prime Minister had spoken of. Several shops are closed, their store fronts graffito'd or vandalised.
Before the onset of evening each of the prospective task force members receives a delivery of a package (One even finds its way to Ged in his recently acquired room). The only content of each is a datacard. When accessed in conjunction with the decoder on a computer terminal, their screens display the following message:
"374-400 Roturi Way, The Industrials. Buzz at the gate twice, wait forty seconds, then buzz again."

Taran sits, dawn not far from gracing him with its presence, thinking of the hunt.
*“This hunt is very unusual. My armor is far too distinctive for casual travel, what with this ferrocrete and durasteel jungle instead of actual wilderness, and much more cunning prey.”*
He rises and dresses as inconspicuously as he can with what he has, and goes out to wander the near bazaar, looking for a fuller and larger robe in a tasteful dark gray, one that can cover his armor and gear, at least till he makes the upcoming appointment. Once successful, he returns to his apartment and equips himself, then sets out for the address he memorized the night before, before using the scrambler program and then physically destroying the card itself.
*“I will have to acquire new gear for this hunt. I hope this Salcuan Policing Authority has decent equipment.”*
He arrives slightly early and follows the instructions he was given, buzzing twice and waiting for a forty count before buzzing again.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-24 09:35:39)

Ged settles for the first place he can find as a suitable sleeping quarter. He has no idea of whether this area has any reputation of crime or insecurity, and even if he did, he isn´t overly concerned about his security. Few thugs in their right minds would try something with a heavily armed and armored warrior, and if they recognize him as Mandalorian, even the tougher or desperate will most likely back off.
Following the instructions to decode the message, he memorizes the address before swiftly disposing of the data in the instructed manner, and then goes to sleep.
Come morning, he suits up and heads out for the meeting place. Wondering if he´ll be the first there, he gets his answer as he closes in and spots that "noble" from the other night. Apparently he has decided to dress a little less flashy this day, something Ged thinks to be a smart move. Hopefully, he will know to keep his mouth a little more discreet as well, although that seems more like wishful thinking.
Approaching slowly, assuming the other to have already knocked the door, the Mandalorian warrior offers a simple greeting.
"Morning...Taran was it? I trust you found a good nights sleep?"

## Re: C002 - The Second Ripple

### **Magical2099** (2010-02-24 19:17:40)

Taran turns at the words behind him, finding the Mandalorian that decided to stay on for the hunt. Finding himself slightly surprised that the warrior recognizes him in full armor with helmet, mask, and purposefully over-sized robe, Taran simply attributes it to the being's culture. Wearing armor all the time must give them a heightened appreciation for body language.
**"Yes. You gave no name yesterday, unless it was before my arrival. What should I call you? As for the night's slumber, no. I find it hard to rest when there is work to be done."**

"The name is Ged. And I think you would do well to get rid of such a habit. If the work we are expected to do is of the nature I think, you may find that being able to catch a moment of rest whenever possible is crucial"
That would have to suffice for an introduction, Ged thought. After all, he technically wasn´t part of the clan anymore, so in fact Ged was the only name he had to offer. While waiting for something to happen at the door, the warrior looked around, searching for any signs of the others that would arrive. And just in case, he kept his rifle in hand, ready to take aim at the sign of people that *weren´t* supposed to arrive.

**"Remain alert, in every sense of the word."**
T'iallo admonishes his protege before donning his helmet and proceeding to the prescribed meeting place. Once he gains sight of the pair already occupying the gated area, he frowns at himself for having been pre-empted. Quickly he expands his senses in the Force, his paranoia not fully having abaited as he seeks any signs of ambush.
He didn't know what to make of the two. Elashi's instruction on who and what the Mandalorian's were and the young noble's over all bearing did not instill him with much confidence. The fop even more so as the arrogant youth's glances at his cathar ward had not gone unnoticed by T'iallo. But at least in that he trusts Elashi's ability to handle herself.

Ketenna approaches the rendezvous, slightly disappointed to find she and Qur'aiden were arriving last. She wonders how long they were going to be forced to wait out in the open. If it was for too much longer then she was sure their group would probably start attracting attention. The Codru-ji woman glances around, her paranoia surfacing. The may be in an industrial sector of the city, but that didn't mean that people wouldn't notice a group of people congregate. After scanning the area, she nods a greeting to the other men and the young Cathar woman. "**Has the gate been buzzed?**" She didn't want to stand out in the open longer than necessary.
===========================================================================
Elashi nods to her mentor as he admonishes her, but believes that it was unnecessary considering the circumstances. With the approach to the waiting group, she stays behind T'iallo as she too scans the surrounding area, T'iallo's paranoia encompassing her as well.
"**Good morning**," she says once with the waiting group, trying to be friendly. They were going to be working together after all. She tries to ignore her anxiousness from being near the Mandalorian.

Ged watches the armored Jedi and his Cathar apprentice appear. He still found it odd that a Jedi was wearing armor, that was quite rare. But of course, having the heritage he did, he was probably not very neutral in the matter. He looks at his apprentice - he really needed to get better with names - and responds her greeting with a slight nod of the head.
He decides to let the silence remain, neither out of a desire to insult anyone or because he was tired from the early hour. He just didn´t feel like he had anything to say to them at the moment.
As the last two members of the team arrives, he greets them in the same manner. No, he is not a social wonder, but that´s what you get for living as a mercenary most of your life.
"Yes, we are waiting for someone to open"

After several minutes, there is a creak, a groan, and the gate swings open to admit them into the walled compound.
Like most industrial facilities, 374-400 Roturi Way is not dissimilar to a fortress, designed in such a way as to keep undesirables out and industrial secrets in. It is unsurprising that it might also serve as a good base location for a secret operation.
Beyond the looming compound walls is a paved outer courtyard, broken up by three unattractive blocky buildings. The nearest is the most inviting of the set, a four-storey windowed structure that looks like it is designed to serve as reception and administrative space. The other two seem to have no windows, and were it not for the presence of doors in each they would appear like nothing so much as giant duracrete bricks.
'*Good morning honoured guests, welcome to Teiton Industries*,' chirps a small spherical droid hovering near the entrance, '*please follow me and I will direct you through the facility.*'
As the little mechanical buzzes in the direction of the administrative building, the compound gate clangs shut.

### **Magical2099** (2010-03-04 18:17:03)

Taran's greetings are interrupted by the doors, but as soon as the droid falls silent he speaks and his voice ripples throughout the depths of the outer courtyard-
**"Greetings all. Ged and I have made introductions, and as I stated a morning gone I am Taran of House Braynon. Taran will do amongst our group here. I would be honored to know your names. Afterwards, Ged, myself, and I believe I heard you called T'iallo, will need to discuss our attires: if a Hunter is not stealthy he tends to starve, and we three are rather conspicuous in our respective armors, are we not?"**
He follows the droid deeper into the courtyard, his body half turned in a graceful but secretly uncomfortable pose so that he may present the appearance of focusing on the group. In actuality his mind is racing, analyzing details of the surroundings more so than his companions.

## Re: C002 - The Second Ripple

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-05 08:41:50)

Following the small droid through the gate, Ged let his rifle hang loosely in one hand at his side as he took in the surroundings. It looked like a normal industrial complex, and was plain and simple enough that any form of secret operation would find it a good place to be based. Unfortunately, those same qualities also made it a very good spot if you wanted to dispatch of someone in a discreet and unseen way.
While he really had no reason to be worried about an ambush he kept a vigilant eye open just in case.

### **Alicia** (2010-03-07 19:37:09)

Ketanna follows behind the droid when the door to the compound opened and releases a sigh of relief of finally getting away from the street. Glancing around the courtyard she eyes the three surrounding buildings. With seemingly disinterest she responds to the noble's introduction and request for names. "**Kentanna**," she says simply, glancing ahead to the administrative building they were making their way towards.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Elashi wisely restrains the sudden giggle at the mention of her mentor forgoing his usual attire. The armor was like his second skin and it had always surprised her when they had gone on exercises in the surrounding wilds without it. Sulca could be a dangerous place after all.
"**I am Elashi**," her amusement at the expense of her mentor is betrayed in the tone of her voice as she responds. With a glance at T'iallo she remembers his earlier admonishment, sobers, and proceeds to go back to her easement of their surroundings; reaching out with the Force and her other sense as T'iallo had taught her in the wilds.

T'iallo glances down at the buzzy little droid before Taran's statement catches his attention and the Firrerreoan's attention swings to him.
**"We will decide upon such when we actually know what is required. To *discuss*,"** the Errant Knight says with sneer, **"such now would be foolish. We do not hunt *game* Braynon. We defend the innocent and punish those that would bring ill to the Cluster."**
Although T'iallo's face is covered, his looming posture and the snarling crag lion visage crafted into his faceplate makes his gaze all the more intense.
**"If you have difficulty differentiating between the two, then it would be best if you remain behind or seek *sport* elsewhere."**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Qur'aiden remains in a mostly grumbling, crotchety silence as the group proceeds through the gates. In the entirety of his short life, he had never had a trip through a gate that had ended positively.
The Miralukan didn't expect this time to be any different.
When the droid appears he brightens somewhat, the youth squints at it, attempting to discern its make and model. He scratches at the unkempt mop of his hair, thinking on where he may have heard of Teiton Industries before.

### **Magical2099** (2010-03-15 10:28:49)

As T'iallo speaks Taran's Varg, a large canine predator from his homeworld, shaped helm turns to face him.
**"Well T'iallo, since you obviously believe yourself capable of saving the system single handedly it is no surprise that you are so foolish as to not see what is in front of you. Since meeting you, I have offered you nothing more or less than the respect due all beings. You have offered pride, arrogance, insult and hubris. Very well, I will return the favor. Allow me to explain to you why this is a hunt, and if I use words that are too large for you please feel free to interrupt."
"Firstly: what are innocents but those unable to defend themselves against the depredations of others? They are prey."
"Secondly: who are those who feed upon the innocent? Why, I do believe they are called predators!"
"Lastly: what is that which hunts the hunter? Another predator: One who refuses to take weak prey, one who understands that doing so is beneath them, wasteful, and not a way to grow stronger. One who feels honor bound to protect the weak because they are *capable* of hunting the hunters."
"Sport has little to do with the equation of life, T'iallo. And if I choose to enjoy a job well done, who are *you* to judge me for it? What is more, if you understand so little of life, why do you disgrace the image of the predator that adorns your armor by wearing it?"**
Nerves on edge, well aware that any being still alive that displays that kind of disregard for all he meets must be very martially able, Taran prepares himself mentally for the likelihood of his first breech of the First Law: if you can't kill it, leave it alone.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-15 11:16:08)

Resisting a sudden urge to switch his weapon to stun and return the peace and quiet to the group, Ged instead just shakes his head, almost sad that his helmet don´t allow his facial expressions to show.
"Oh just shut up, both of you. Unless you think this is a very constructive way to start off working together, can you at least try to appear as if you weren´t born yesterday? You´ve both been showing off your share of arrogance, and frankly it´s getting on my nerves"
He paused for a moment, but continued again before any of the two could interrupt with childish comments - as he was sure they would have. He then turned to T'iallo.
"I don´t know what kind of Jedi you are, but so far it´s hard to beleive you didn´t find that lightsaber in a dumpster somewhere. If you think that just because you have the Force at your side, you are better than those who don´t, then perhaps you should consult a library for a history lesson"
And next he turned to Taran.
"That goes for you too. I don´t know what kind of standing you had where you are coming from, but I also don´t know why I should care. So far, you´ve been acting like a spoiled brat with a very high opinion of himself and a belief that he holds the absolute truths of the Galaxy. Neither of which is a good trait for someone that´ll work as part of a group"
Figuring he had said enough, Ged turned his attention back to the surroundings. *And they call* us *savages…*, he thought to himself.

## Re: C002 - The Second Ripple

### **Anazider** (2010-03-15 12:24:41)

T'iallo holds out a hand to halt Elashi, allowing the other two to distance themselves further ahead as he stops. There is a dangerous growl to his voice, one that the Cathar will recognize as a tone of warning. Through their bond she can feel his fury rising, savage and proud.
**"And there you make your mistake *Mandalorian*," The Errant Knight spits the word, as if it were of no substance to him. "I am of no Jedi order that you would know. But if it is history that that you wish to harp upon, then I can indulge you both in a lesson."**
He further imposes himself between Elashi and the other two armored warriors, his posture and slight pacing showing his agitation.
**"I can detail for you the history of the dangers that plague the Itaran cluster and its people; *My* people. What do you know of the Sluuvath migrations and the Crag Lion packs? Of the poachers, and slavers, and smugglers that corrupt Salcu to its very foundations? Would you know how to survive the Quasrene tundra in the heart of winter?"**
The Errant Knight ceases his pacing, but the bearing of his stance and the harshness of his voice suggests imminent violence. He looks from one armored warrior to the other, and then settles upon Ged as the greater threat.
**"I suffer your presence at Teiain's behest, and only that because I wish to believe he has the people's best interests at heart. But continue in your ignorance to lecture me on who I *am* and the signifigance of what we do here and I will be forced to teach you a very different lesson than this one… And then the Prime Minister will have to find two more warriors to accompany us. Hopefully they will be less foolhardy."**

## Re: C002 - The Second Ripple

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-15 13:09:50)

If it hadn´t been such a sad point proven, Ged would have smiled as the ignorant Jedi - or whatever he was - proved it. Even if he heard, he wasn´t listening. And if he thought to disturb Ged by speaking the name of his people in such a derogatory tone, he was gravely mistaken. Ged had been cast out by his own people, exiled from his home, and only recently begun to find his way back to his roots. What one prejudiced fool thought couldn´t bother him less. With unmoving features on both inside and outside of his armor, the warrior didn´t move.
"I have no desire to fight unnecessary fights, least of all against one who I´m supposed to be working together with. But thank you for proving my point. I don´t know much about this region, but I can hardly imagine it to be that much different from similar places across the Galaxy. But of course, this is *your* home, so I guess it has to be pretty special"
The sarcasm in the last sentence was not difficult to hear. He was just as reluctant to fight as he made apparent, but just in case the hot-headed fool decided to try something he slung his rifle across his back, leaving both hands free to fight with. A person who could so freely interpret what was being said to him would certainly not hesitate to resort to violence.
"I never presumed to know who you are, I merely pointed out what you appears to be. But since you appears to know so much about my people, I also hope you know we are not easy to kill, should you choose to pursue this needless confrontation"

Ketanna sighs and shakes her head as the three men start are verbal head butt. It would only be a matter of time she realizes before things came to blows. While such a fact was probably inevitable, this would hardly be the place or time for it to occur. She moves past the men into the lead, stops and turns so she faces all three of them. "**Gentlemen, we're not here to be at odds with each other, but to work together to help the people in the Cluster. As we all don't know each other very well, it's not unexpected that some… head butting is going to happen. But if we're all of the same goal to help the people here and now, then nothing else matters.**" She pauses looking at each of them. "**Everything else will fall into line as long as we keep the goal in mind.**"
Elashi stops at T'iallos command, caution trumping the annoyance at the misunderstanding which seemed to have formed between the three obvious proud warriors. "**Master**," she starts tentatively, her clawed hand reaches out to rest calmly on his arm. She is about to continue when Ketanna speaks. Adding her own voice to the older woman's admonishments, she says slowly "**I think everyone needs to take a step back and think. Personal pride and anger won't help anyone.**."

Ged listened to what Ketanna said, happy to hear that at least some of his new companions showed signs of wisdom. He may have overreacted a bit, but he had already begun to get a little disturbed by Taran´s arrogant behavior, and he knew for a fact that letting two equally arrogant people have at each other made life pretty miserable for those unfortunate enough to be trapped in their vicinity. He also had his concern about their ability to function in the field, if they would be able to see beyond their own opinions and thoughts, to follow a bigger strategy.
Nevertheless, he hoped the four-armed womans interjection would be the end of it. He wouldn´t say that his opinion of either man - especially T'iallo - had heightened, and he didn´t take lightly to insults, but he was willing to let it slide for the greater cause.
"You´re right, of course. I apologize if I let my temper get the better of me. I will try not to let it happen again"
He reaches out his hand towards the others. He still stood by every word he had said, as was his way, but unless he found reason to bring it up again he would try to keep it to himself. He waits with patience to see if either of the two would take his hand, and what reflections they would offer over their own behavior. He suspects it will reveal a bit about their overall character.

Taran at first finds himself surprised at Ged's outburst, and then angered once again by the man's assumptions about him. After the other fool's blathering reply laced with prejudice, he finds himself wondering if the people of this cluster are worth these repeated insults by men who have no knowledge of his character. Then Ketanna restates Ged's words, sans insults, and Taran finds himself more surprised at Ged's apology. He decides to allow the Mandalorian to think what he wishes, he will simply prove him wrong on the trail.
He reaches forward and clasps the man's forearm, and knowing that anything said would be taken as "arrogant drivel from a spoiled brat," explains nothing. He simply says, **"Agreed. My apologies are offered as well."**
He turns and looks at the overly confrontational buffoon, glad that his entire gamut of reactions has been concealed by his helm.
