# [Welcome to the Arena!] A Bright-Eyed Demon Comes o' Calling

### **Magical2099** (2011-04-01 03:33:41)

Kaz Torev stepped off the boarding ramp of the tramp freighter that had brought him to Killee-Kor and waved to its captain and pilot, an odd being from Corellia. The little silver tongued rogue had been intriguing company, with an eclectic taste in music. He had told Kaz that: **"Emotions are what drive warm blooded beings like us. They're our demons and our masters. Music is a way of expressing our emotions, paying homage to our demons. It's sympathy for the devil, eh? Ha!"** The tramp freighter lifted off as its pilot returned Kaz's wave, and its external speakers blared, **"Good luck in this hell-hole mate!"** The ship put its nose to the sky, and was quickly gone.
Kaz soon finds himself outside the spaceport, in the dry dusty streets of Killee-Kor. Behind him lies the hostile terrain of Socorro; before him, the sprawl of the planet's largest city and the home of Rav's Arenas. The streets are full of beings from all across the galaxy and all walks of life. Here in the outskirts poverty is the norm, so the number of dirty and shifty eyed people is high. Here and there in the crowds Kaz can see an outlandish figure or armored nightmare, all of which share one thing in common: a yellow badge, sometimes worn on the shoulder, the arm, the head, or wherever makes it most visible. Hawkers cry their trinkets, food, droids, and valuables of all kinds, and toughs stand before businesses to rough them up should the hawkers interfere with the businesses' customers. Filthy prostitutes of dozens of species roam and linger, hungry looks bringing them customers too stupid to see the hunger isn't for them. The place reeks with the rancid smell of thousands of co-mingled unwashed bodies and garbage. Despite all this, the place lives and thrives, and feels incredibly alive.
A haggard old man, stooped with age and poverty approaches Kaz, **"Ah'mazin' in its own way, ain't it sonny? Welcome to Killee-Kor."**

*Well sister,* Kaz thinks to himself as he looks around, *let us trust to luck - because The Force left us long ago.*
An old man hobbles over in his direction. He looks like he's come on hard times recently, though from the looks of it Kaz can see that's the norm around here. Pulling a ten-credit from his pocket, he says: "**Indeed it is - in its own way. My name is Kaz Torev and I'm here to compete in the arena. This,**" he hands the money to the man and grins wide, "**is for letting me know the quickest way to it, and the name of the best place to eat. It's been a long flight with lousy food, and I don't like to fight on an empty stomach.**"

### **Magical2099** (2011-04-05 10:10:29)

The large grin and offering of money sets the old man on edge for a moment, but the hesitancy is quickly overcome by greed. He points down the street, **"Closest Arena is down that'a'ways mister. As for edibles, I'mma head over to the womp cart yonder,"** he gestures in the opposite direction to a small one man cart run by a Twi'Lek shouting about the thirteen different ways he can prepare womp rat. **"He makes a mean rat pie and a better rat burger, and he sells hooch made outta sump'in terrible. Make ya go blind for nigh on twelve hour it will. You might wanna try the *Gladiator's Rest*, a block past the Arena. All round nice joint if'n ya got the cred. Run by one o'dem Zeltrons. Good eatin', good drinkin', entertainment and better company, way I hear'd it. Tell 'em Pappy sent ya, might get ya a lil discount,"** he says before turning and heading for the womp cart.

"**Thank you…very much.**" The man's abrupt departure cutting of Kaz in mid-sentence.
*Well,* he thinks to himself, *so much for my first attempt at making a name for myself. Kaz the Generous Idiot. Perhaps it's not a total loss - the Gladiator's Rest might be worth a stop. Maybe someone there has heard of Slomo and can help get Lora out. Or better yet,* a dark look of delight crosses his visage briefly, *maybe I'll get to trash some of his cronies in the Arena and get paid for it.*
That last thought steels his heart once more, and he sets of resolutely in the direction of the Gladiator's Rest.

### **Magical2099** (2011-04-05 11:54:41)

About twenty minutes later Kaz passes the local Arena and finds the *Gladiator's Rest*, which seems to be what's left of a pleasure yacht with many additions done in the local stone. The main area, what was once a cargo hold, is strewn with empty tables due to the early hour. Behind the bar on the far side of the room stands a female Zeltron, a pixy-like girl who gives Kaz a tired sultry smile that belies her youthful appearance, **"Welcome to the *Gladiator's Rest*. Aren't you a handsome devil, what's your name?"**

---

## Re: A Bright-Eyed Demon Comes o' Calling

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-05 12:17:43)

"**Uh, thanks. My name's Kaz Torev. I here to compete in the Arena.**" Caught off-guard by the sight of someone not covered in grime or bloodstains, or both, Kaz stumbles over his words. He contrasts her with his first encounter on Killee-Kor, and then remembers to add: "**I heard about your place from an…**" Kaz pauses for a moment, choosing his words carefully, "**…interesting gentleman. He said his name was Pappy, and that you had 'good eatin' here.**"
He approaches the bar and takes a seat, careful to set his pack safely next to his feet. One must be careful with flamethrowers and frag grenades as a rule, but if the two should ever bump into each other too hard...well. It's not a pleasant thought.
"**So I guess that explains why *I'm* here, but what's your story, Miss…?**"

---

## Re: A Bright-Eyed Demon Comes o' Calling

### **Magical2099** (2011-04-05 13:04:24)

**"You can call me Trix, and I have no idea who 'Pappy' is,"** she says giggling at his briefly assumed accent. **"I own this place. If you're going into the Arena this is a great place to relax and get your mind off it too. My bar is renowned for its food and drink, my hotel for its great beds and amazing company. What can I interest you in?"** she asks as she leans over the bar and taps a touch screen in front of him, listing all the establishments services and prices.
The bar menu covers a large variety of foods and drink, from high-end to cheaper dishes that, if done right, are better than gourmet. A meal runs around fifty credits and comes with a non-alcoholic drink. Alcohol runs the gamut of five credits per glass to two hundred per shot, depending on the poison.
The hotel menu is much shorter, listing vacancies and going rates of one hundred credits per day, with a foot note on the price of company varying. A sub-menu lists weekly rates of seven hundred for ten days, one meal per day included, and another note stating that rooms can be let monthly, see management. A short Terms of Agreement follows, consisting mostly of agreeing not to bring outside food, drink or entertainment into the *Gladiator's Rest*.
A third menu lists the times of availability of the Establishment's entertainment, to be found in the Red Room, behind the bar proper in what was once the pleasure yacht's throne room. There-in company may be hired and different 'dealers in the exotic' may be consulted.
Looking around as he reads Kaz can tell a great deal of effort has gone into the place. It is very clean, and there is little fading to the paint or roughness to the upholstery. Trix spins on the ball of one foot and begins wiping down the preparation area behind her, not moving far but giving him time to make up his mind.

*No surprise there - Pappy'd probably break out in a rash if he ate in a clean place like this.*
"**Well Trix, I can't say I'm surprised you don't know Pappy - though the fact that you aren't selling rat burgers off a cart should have been a hint.**" Kaz smirks sheepishly, then continues: "**You look like you know how to make a killer omelette, so just make me one of those and throw in whatever you like - I'm sure it'll be just fine. And a glass of nerfmilk when it's ready, if you please.**" He pulls the credits from his pocket and places them on the counter, and then turns back to the screen.
*700 credits for a room for a ten days isn't too steep, and it includes breakfast. Still, I wonder…*
"**Hmmm. This hotel menu seems to be missing something,**" Kaz remarks, putting on his best puzzled look. "**I see that it's 700 for room for a week and a half, but I can't seem to find the discount for "*handsome devils*" listed anywhere. Is that on another screen or…?**"

She impishly grins at his flirting, **"Well well, a devil with a silver tongue too huh? Best I can do there is add another meal to it sugah. Win a few in the Arena, bring me some more business with that beguiling blue grin of yours, then we'll talk about a discount,"** she says with a wink as she turns and punches his order into a nearby terminal. She comes back and collects his credits, leaving a tall ice cold glass of fresh nerfmilk.
Shortly, a buxom Twi'Lek comes from the back with a large steaming platter that she places before him with a warm smile **"Dig in handsome, we want you strong for the Arena. Can't have that face getting damaged now, can we?"** she says before turning to saunter out. On the platter is quite possibly the largest omelet Kaz has ever seen, and the variety of scents wafting up from it briefly make him think he's drowning in saliva.
Trix approaches and sets a bowl full of thick and fluffy leaves of flat bread next to his plate, grinning after the Twi'Lek, **"I believe a discount for you might be a bad idea. You might be disruptive to my employees,"** she says with another slow wink as she passes him some utensils.

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-05 14:30:49)

*Better than nothing I suppose.*
"**Sounds like a deal.**" Kaz smiles and forks over the 700 credits. He's spent quite a bit already, but he hopes to win it all back soon enough. And at least it's not a room in wherever Pappy stays.
"**So tell me Trix, you ever hear of a Hutt named Slomo? Or come across anyone that has? It's sort of the reason I'm here…**" he manages, in between bites of the most delicious breakfast he's had in a long time.
*Yes Lora, I haven't forgotten you. I'll deal in charm and credits outside the Arena, but I'll deal only death when within its walls.*

**"Hmmm, not off the top of my head sugah. Had a girl here once by that name, real popular. Married a gladiator and quit the business though. Might be kin to Goodo, the local slime dispenser. I'll ask the girls and let ya know tomorrow, kay? No charge this time,"** she says cheerily. **"Here's your key, your room is past the Red Room, third on the right. Gave you one with an extra large bed,"** she giggles again, before wandering off to meet a red haired human woman who looks to be wide awake. The two hug and chat very quietly before Trix disappears into the back.
The red haired woman approaches from behind the bar with a warm smile on her face until Kaz looks up. When he does she hesitates and makes an odd hand gesture before putting on a forced smile and asking if he needs anything, discomfort seeming to radiate from her.

"**No, I believe I'm all set for now thanks,**" Kaz replies nonchalantly, continuing to enjoy his meal. "**Is there something I can do for *you*…?**"
He pauses, waiting for a reply. The hand gesture didn't go unnoticed, but he's at a loss for what it could've been about. She might know about Slomo or she might have a malfunctioning prosthetic. Kaz didn't have much experience with Force-users, but he was pretty sure they'd do a better job at mind control than this.

**"No *Cythraul*, I need nothing from you,"** she says, seeming to have had her suspicions confirmed she turns and begins stocking the bar. As she works, Kaz catches her watching him, never meeting his eyes again, throughout his breakfast, which disappears quickly. The fifty credit price stung a bit, but after tasting it and judging by the warm feeling it left him it was well worth it.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The perception check was an abysmal failure, that's why you can't tell exactly what her problem is. The gather info was better, but they take time. Remember to check up with Trix later for more information. The persuasion check was a failure to Haggle, but succeeded for improve attitude.

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-06 10:30:22)

*Well that man was right about one thing: this place is amazing "in its own way". Some people just can't be figured out.*
After finishing his delicious meal in relative silence, Kaz grabs his bag and, with a word of thanks, heads out the door toward the Arena. He'd had some time to think about strategies and how long it will take to win back his sister, but always his thoughts towards her brought grief. He couldn't imagine what she was going through and it was almost enough to make him regret the meal - she certainly wasn't eating that well. He needed strength for the fights ahead though, and honoring Lora by being weak wasn't such a good plan. He only had his pistol, and his boot knife for now - and a few moves he'd picked up dodging drunkards over the years. It would be just as much about cunning as force. Seeing all the yellow badges in the crowds he thinks:
*No matter. I will win and rescue Lora and go home, and I will not waste pity on those who get in my way.*

### **Magical2099** (2011-04-08 02:33:03)

Just one block down from his temporary residence Kaz finds the massive complex of this quarter's Arena. There is a steady but light flow of foot traffic at this hour, and the yellow badges are more concentrated here. On entering, he sees the many and varied warriors with yellow badges congregating around a droid on his right while his left is occupied by normal folk around a different droid. The two crowds don't just differ in dress, they differ in temperament. The civilians are an ugly crowd, vicious and bloodthirsty, placing bets to jeers and catcalls of their fellows. The gladiators are much quieter, some nervous, some calm as they view the screens behind the droid. As he enters the group of gladiators the droid notices his lack of badge and speaks, **"Good morning sir. Do you wish to become a combatant? What match would you like?"** The droid turns and gestures to the small screen on his right, listing the mornings match-ups.
Ubese: Electropole with Electrograpple grip. 1500
Trandoshan: Concussion Rifle with Extra Power Source. 1500
Thakwaash: Snare Rifle with Shock Stick bayonet. 3000

## Re: A Bright-Eyed Demon Comes o' Calling

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-08 10:14:17)

Kaz looks at the screen for a few moments, weighing his options.
*The Ubese seems the safest bet, as the other two both have reputations of killers. It probably doesn't much matter here anyway, since that's the whole point.*
"**Yes I do, and I'll take the Ubese with the Electropole please. I have my own wager right here…**" he lifts up his bag, containing the flamethrower and grenades. Feeling a little anxious for his first match to begin, he thinks back to the reason he's at the Arena - Lora. His determination and love for his sister quell whatever fears he may have, and as he waits for further directions, Kaz strains to hear any mention from either crowd of Slomo.

The droid lifts a scanner to the contents of the bag, chirping affirmatively at its contents. **"The explosive devices will be held by your gate attendant, per Arena regulations. Your pit is through the left hand corridor, third level down, second pit from the turbolift cluster. Good luck!"** the droid says cheerily. As he makes his way to the turbolift cluster down the left corridor Kaz lingers, catching bits of conversation as he goes. Unfortunately, he hears nothing of Slomo or any Hut other than Goodo.

Kaz heads off for his designated pit listening attentively to the sea of shatter around him.
*Hmm. Nothing about Slomo, but I'll have to check out this Goodo character after the match.*
He approaches the attendant and checks in his wager, then walks hesitantly towards the gate. The anxiety begins to take hold again and Kaz rests his hand on his blaster pistol. His opponent almost certainly has better armament, but maybe his overconfidence -however justified- can be exploited. The roar of the Arena crowds reverberates through the walls of the hall, and Kaz has time for a final thought before the gate begins to open:
*Well, my Ubese friend, your bright-eyed demon has come to call.*

A rusted and almost ruined battle droid of unknown manufacture with NON-COMBATANT in large yellow letters across his chest waits before the cage, taking the explosives and explaining the basics. **"The announcer will begin the match, kill your opponent, then return here for your winnings. Good luck,"** its recording done, Kaz steps into the cage before him and gets his first look at the pit. The pit seems to be modeled on some kind of mausoleum, with lighting along the walls that doesn't quite penetrate the gloom at the center, and four sarcophagi surrounding a central pitfall. In a cage across from him, Kaz can see something moving, and an occasional electrical discharge.
**""COME ONE, COME ALL TO THE KILLEE-KOR ARENA!!! THIS MORNING WE HAVE A UBESE, THOSE BEINGS KNOWN FOR SURVIVING THE WORST THE GALAXY HAS TO OFFER, VERSUS A STRIKINGLY MARKED ZABRAK, ANOTHER SPECIES KNOWN FOR ITS HARDINESS! THIS MATCH SEEMS TO BE SHAPING UP TO A WAR OF ATTRITION!! BEGIN!!"**

the sarcophagi provide cover if you are adjacent, the pit is deep enough to hurt if you fall in it, and the center of the map is low-light (granting concealment), past the sarcophagi is well lit though. think three columns, light dark light, with the dark being were you both start. you can see him, but its barely. you won the initiative, so you open. good luck!

*Let's get this party started…*
Kaz aims his blaster pistol carefully and prepares to fire a bolt into the darkness. Somebody has to start the shooting, and it might as well be him. Standing out in the open may not be the best plan, but he prefers the shadows until he knows a little more about the Ubese warrior. As his eyes begin to adjust to the low light levels Kaz catches a glimpse of movement and fires the first shot of the match.

Kaz's shot flies wide in the darkness, but it does serve to light his opponent just as he rears back and launches his weapon at Kaz. The arcing electropole flies over Kaz's head to clatter to the ground, and Kaz hears an odd noise behind him. He turns to see the electropole flying back towards him! It's slow speed makes it easily side-steppable though. Kaz watches as the weapon returns to its owner's hand, and the Ubese hefts it again just seconds after having thrown it.

Deciding to close the distance to his Ubese opponent and perhaps give the audience an unexpected show, Kaz sprints past the pit and leaps onto the far sarcophagus. He doesn't bother with aiming and hopes his shot will find it's mark. He's definitely relying on his innate agility to dodge that electropole at this range.

Kaz's leaping and closing with his opponent draw the first cheers of the match, followed by collective 'awwww's as he misses by a large margin. At first the Ubese recoils from the unorthodox charge, then he meets it with a charge of his own, rounding the end of the crypt and lashing out with his sparking electropole. The pole catches Kaz's leg, embedding itself in the flesh and discharging a massive amount of electricity, causing his entire body to seize momentarily. First blood and an enthusiastic round of applause goes to the Ubese.

He fires at the Ubese, now in full lighting, and takes a moment to catch his breath and brace against a sarcophagi. His leg hurt a lot, but he can ignore it for now.

The shot staggers the Ubese, burning clean through his left collar-bone. He hefts his Electropole and follows as Kaz retreats, hoping to end the fight quickly. As Kaz jumps down from the sarcophagus the Ubese climbs it, striking out at his brash opponent. His weapon finds less purchase this time, but it stills sends a massive jolt of electricity through the Zabrak. The crowd's cheering drowns out all sound of their movement, and almost drowns out the blaster in Kaz's hand.

The electricity courses through Kaz's body, and he knows this will all be over soon - one way or another. Faltering backwards, he leaps up onto the opposite sarcophagus.
"**The difference between you and me**" taunts Kaz, loud enough for the newly injured Ubese to hear over the roaring crowd, "**is that I can't store things in my collarbone!**"
As soon as the words are out of his mouth he wonders where that came from, and a momentary look of confusion crosses his face. Chalking it up to his low tolerance of high voltage and the deafening sound of the crowd, Kaz fires again.

The Ubese crumples to the floor as the crowd rises to it's feet, cheering and applauding. The battle droid that let him into the pit approaches and collects the electropole and matching gauntlet, passing them to Kaz along with the match's purse of 1500 credits and his wagered items. The Arena speakers crackle to life:
**"AH HA HA!! THE ZABRAK ARE THE TOUGHEST IN THIS MATCH!!! LET'S HEAR OUR WINNER'S NAME AND GIVE HIM HIS FAIR DUE!!!"**

As his shot finally finds its mark, Kaz breathes a sigh of relief. He expected pain, and in that regard he wasn't disappointed. He didn't expect the crowd to affect him quite so much though, and he takes a moment to enjoy his victory. Amid the applause his thoughts shift to his sister, and he's reminded of his real purpose here. As the droid approaches with his winnings, Kaz raises his hands in triumph. He looks at the microphone placed in front of him, and pauses...
"**I am Kaz Torev…**" he says, smiling a little sheepishly as his voice echoes through the speakers - but a thought quickly crosses his mind.
*Perhaps they want something more than just another name…*
Kas smirks devilishly at the crowd, and finishes with "**…and I am the new demon of this Arena.**" He flashes a final grin and backs away from the microphone.
After accepting the payment Kaz makes his way out of the Arena and back to the *Gladiator's Rest* to stow his equipment. Trix may know a good place to fix up his leg, and she may have turned up a thing or two on Slomo in the meantime.

**Whoa**. That was simultaneously fun and educational - usually two mutually exclusive adjectives. I'll adjust my character sheet accordingly and then, if you don't have any other plans, have Kaz return to Trix's place. It's probably only been a few hours since Kaz left, but that's fine.

The crowd's applause is thunderous and the announcer comes back on, **"A DEMON FOR OUR ARENA!! WE'VE HAD THOSE BEFORE HAVEN'T WE FOLKS?! THIS GLADIATOR SHALL BE OUR FIRST SAPPHIRE DEMON!!! CONGRATULATIONS BLUE DEMON!!! WE AWAIT YOUR RETURN!!"** the announcer's voice dies and the crowd continues to cheer as Kaz makes his way from the pit. He rides the adrenaline high all the way back to the lobby where the droid who set up his match waits.
**"Sir Torev? Congratulations on your victory. Here is your Arena badge,"** he says handing over a yellow badge identical to the hundreds Kaz has seen since entering the city. **"With it you can access the Arena-Net from any Arena, or you may purchase an Arena-Pad, which will allow access from anywhere in the city."**

## Re: A Bright-Eyed Demon Comes o' Calling

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-26 10:35:47)

In a rush to seek rest and treatment, Kaz almost passes the droid in the lobby.
"**Thank you. And I think I'll pass on the Arena pad for now.**" he replies with a nod, and heads towards the door.
"**On second though,**" he turns back, "**How much for one? It might be more useful than checking back here every hour.**"
*And it might make it easier to prepare for upcoming matches…* Kaz thinks to himself. The Ubese was a tough fight - and he only had an electropole. There's no telling who might be bringing heavier gear into a match, and Kaz's blaster pistol could be easily dwarfed.
After purchasing the pad and stowing it in his pack, Kaz heads back to the *Gladiator's Rest*  with a slight limp. He wears the bright yellow badge on the left breast of his tunic, just over his heart - a reminder of Lora and that the Sapphire Demon has a reason for haunting the Arena.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

So *now* I'll head off to Trix's, and just let me know how much the Arena Pad costs and I'll adjust accordingly. Is it like a larger database - as in Kaz could search for particular Arena combatants from past matches?

### **Magical2099** (2011-04-26 13:59:12)

Kaz hands over the five hundred credits for the Arena-Pad and hurries on, quickly finding himself back at the *Gladiator's Rest*. Only two hours have passed since he had his massive breakfast and left, and the same woman watches the bar. As Kaz limps in her eyes soften a little, but she still doesn't make eye contact or hold conversation. On inquiring about Trix, he is told that she won't be back till later this evening. Kaz orders a drink and boots up the Arena-Pad.
The start-up is relatively quick in and of itself, its the advertisements that take a while. As they begin playing no amount of button pressing or commands stop them, forcing you to watch, and in some cases, listen. They begin with ads for healeries, hospices, hospitals, healers, hedge-witches, and individual doctor's agents, blasting out the reasons their care is better than all their counterparts. Some seem legitimate, some seem downright unsanitary, particularly the one that plugs itself as a one stop healer/flesh/pleasure house. Three are of note: Goodo's Hospital and Supply, Si-La, Mimwen Medicinals.
The second batch in the gamut are weapons and armor dealers, of which there are easily double the amount of healers. Every manner of weapon known to the galaxy is seen in the images that crawl across the screen with some kind of alien life form screaming "BUY BUY BUY!!!" in the background. Watching closely, you notice the same image, and sometimes the same alien, in ads for different dealers. Three are of note: Goodo's Arms and Supply, Roar's Big Wookie Weapons, and Mandal Motors.
The third group seems to be hotels and casinos/pleasure houses. The advertisements become more outlandish and incomprehensible here and show more variety. Most tout their security features, some their food, some their staff's capabilities, and others their games of chance and private rooms for viewing matches. Three are of note: Goodo's Hotel, Casino, and Supply, Mozdu's Casino Royal, and the Star Resort and Casino.
The last group of ads seems to be the catch all, with everything from banks, speeders and speeder rentals, ships, droids, to toiletries. Three are of note: Goodo's Miscellany and Supply, Jawa Emporium, and We Can Get That For You!!!.
After the ads finally finish you are given control of the Arena-pad, which includes a detailed map and directory of the city with addresses for every merchant mentioned and then some. By touching your badge to the appropriate slot on the pad the outer ring of Arenas light up yellow and a menu pops up. Navigating through the menu displays a listing of all open matches on Tier Six with times, wagers, opponents, odds, frequencies for remote viewing (with 5% discount since you own an Arena-Pad (TM)).
Accessing this information allows you to see the "Calling all Gladiators" notice over Arena 5 of Tier 6. The notice says to contact that Arena's Admin for more details.
The standoffish woman delivers his drink and leaves him to poor over the Arena-Pad.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Its more like a network of all the Arenas, displaying matches, odds, gladiators (Tier 5 and up), and lots of other information.

As Kaz rests in a stool at the counter he watches the screen on his Arena pad with casual interest. He carefully sets his bag down on the floor and motions for a drink from the redheaded woman. He remembers her from earlier, and considers what he may have done that could have made her uncomfortable. Upon receiving his glass he returns his gaze to the pad, which seems to be finishing it's introductory advertisements.
*Well it's good to know you can make a living off Arena matches without actually being in one*, Kaz thinks to himself, mildly disgusted by the vast lists of peddlers on the display. He sips his beverage calmly, and decides to try and make friends with the woman who he'll likely be seeing often for the next ten days. Looking up from his drink he makes an attempt at conversation...
"**Excuse me miss, I was hoping you might help me. I've had quite an …exciting morning,**" he let's his smile show just a little, "**and as a result I find myself in need of some minor medical attention. Can you recommend anyone nearby,**" Kaz pauses, his smile now broadening in a sort of playful, mischievous grin, "**perhaps some place specializing in wounded Cythraul…?**"
It's the phrase she used earlier to refer to him, and he hopes it will get at least a little chuckle out of her. He's really in need of help though, and doesn't want to get swindled. Since he's going to be a resident for awhile it's important to at least try and build a little mutual trust.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Persuasion** +7 to try and get the woman to open up a bit. Apply whatever modifiers are appropriate, considering he uses her own words and has very clearly been wounded (although he's not exactly bleeding all over the floor)...

She almost seems to flinch at the grin, but takes it as mocking when Kaz uses the word *cythraul*, which he has trouble pronouncing properly. Her face softens a little, and she approaches hesitantly. **"No one treats *Cythraul*, not knowingly. Mimwen Medicinals turns away no one though.

"**Ah, then that's where I'll be headed. Thanks for the drink.**" Kaz takes a final gulp and steps off the stool, being sure to leave a decent tip next to the empty glass. Grabbing his bag he heads back towards his room, key in hand.
*Past the red room, third on the right…*
He sets the electropole against the wall and stows everything but his sidearm in the closet. The blaster pistol stays in its holster - just in case - and his knife remains concealed in his boot. He shoves the Arena pad into his pocket as well, thinking it might make for some interesting reading later on. Everything now in its place, Kaz locks the door and sets off for Mimwen Medicinals - not too difficult to find with the pad's occasional directions.

Within an hour Kaz finds himself facing a modest sandstone building with moderate traffic. The larger portion is the outgoing traffic, males and females a varying species leave in twos and threes. Inside, he finds the place stinking of antiseptic with a slight hint of smoke or char. It is staffed by Ithorians. At the desk an Ithorian in a clean white robe greets him, **"Welcome to Mimwen Medicinals. How may we assist you?"**

A few minutes later he says, **"Repairing the damage fully will require surgery, roughly 500 credits.

"**I think I'll have to go the frugal route for a change, as fun as surgery sounds.**" Kaz replies. "**Just work some magic with a medpac and I'll try not to lose any fights too badly in the next few days.**" he adds, smiling. Retrieving the fee from his pocket, he thanks the Ithorian and hopes he can keep that promise. He knows nobody ever loses fights in the Arena - there's only champions and corpses that leave a match.

**"Very well, many are financially strapped in this city, that is why our prices are so low. Someone will be with you shortly,"** the Ithorian says, taking Kaz's credits and making notes on a terminal mounted on the nearby wall. Within a few minutes another Ithorian comes along and breaks open a medpac. He quickly and professionally patches the wound, taking less than ten minutes. When he finishes he says, **"There you are. Eat well and keep hydrated, sleep in late a couple of days and you'll be fine. Have a nice day."**
Kaz soon finds himself outside, following directions from his Arena-Pad to Goodo's Munitions and Supply, a few blocks back towards the *Gladiator's Rest*. As he enters the doors of the large round building his eyes are met by all manner of convenient and attractively packaged death-bringing instruments. The interior is sectioned off into eighths, with each eighths' isles full of different brands and models of similar weapons. There is a section for blasters, rifles and carbines, grenades, slugthrowers, melee weapons, powered melee weapons, heavier weapons, and the last section seems to be a catch all of all manner of non-weapon items. A smattering of heavily armed people wander and peruse the shelves, and several outdated Baktoid Arms Super Battle Droids stand at each entrance and in the center behind a circular check out counter that serves to house very expensive items. The SBD nearest Kaz turns and asks, **"Welcome to Goodo's Munitions and Supply, how may we serve?"**

*Well somebody knows how to stay in business…* Kaz thinks, entering the shop.
"**Oh hello. I think I'm all set for the moment, thanks. Just browsing.**" replies to the droid. Turning his attention back to the shelves, he begins to wander up and down the aisles with no particular interest in buying anything. His slight limp is near indistinguishable thanks to the Mimwen folks. He knows he needs to upgrade his weaponry, even if it means paying inflated prices. Suddenly he spots what appears to be a DX-2 disruptor pistol. Highly illegal and with massive potential for damage, Kaz has heard of disruptor weapons but never seen one in action.
*Now that's the kind of weapon an Arena Demon should be wielding.*

The nearest SBD answers, **"Tenloss Disruptor, model DX-2. Price: three thousand, seven hundred and fifty credits. Cash, credit, or chip? Would you be interested in any accessories? Or in having it fine tuned by our professional in-house Weapon's Smith? Would you like it gift wrapped?"** the droid's preprogrammed attempts to up-sell the weapon aren't terribly persuasive, but most who would shop here don't need much persuading to spend money on armament. As the droid gives its spiel a massive Thakwaash sidles up, eying the pistol. The being is wearing an odd jacket/tunic contraption with sleeves almost a meter too long and buckles and zippers on the chest, back and sleeves.

"**Okay, thanks. I'll have to pass for now.**" he replies to the droid, wondering what sorts of upgrades were available. The Thakwaash patron seemed interested in it anyway. While his garb indicated he could be some sort of asylum escapee, Kaz wasn't interested in angering him - whether he was crazy or not. "**Looks like it's all yours, friend.**" he smiles, motioning to the disruptor pistol.
"**Let's talk about those upgrades though…**" he says, turning back to the droid. "**What can you do with this?**"
Kaz slowly removes his blaster pistol from its holster, displaying it for the SBD.

The Thakwaash's eyes take on a confused look as Kaz leaves behind the disruptor, and then they land on Kaz's pistol and light up again. As Kaz follows the SBD's gestures he follows along as well, seeming enraptured of all the technology, and seeming lost whenever Kaz and the SBD move on. He keeps up though, appearing to soak in everything said and every thing viewed.

As Kaz focuses his attention on the 2.7 meter tall being it shies back, lifting its arms to cover its head as if expecting a blow. When none comes, the Thakwaash turns and bolts from the building, knocking aside a SBD and never noticing except to jump and run faster at the loud crashing as the droid hits the ground. Every droid watches the Thakwaash exit, but every sentient turns to look at Kaz, some confused, some angrily, some just staring.
Kaz does notice a hint of yellow on the back of the Thakwaash's head as he runs: a Tier Six Arena Badge.

As surprised as most of the other patrons, Kaz watches the Thakwaash bolt through the door and into the street.
*What was that all about?*
Realizing all eyes are on him, Kaz slowly holsters his weapon and nonchalantly approaches the Weapons Smith counter - decidedly ignoring the stares. No doubt some present might have some insight as to what just happened, but until he can get a better idea there's no use in taking sides.
*And I can always look him up on the Arena Pad once I get back to the room.*
"**I apologize for… whatever that was, but I'm fairly new to the area and maybe that sort of thing happens more often than I'm used to?

Kaz ponders some other options, and finally decides on going in a different direction altogether. While the temptation to improve his weapon is great, he's simply not willing to dump all his credits into the pursuit. Not yet anyway.
"**Okay. Thanks so much for taking a look, but I'm going to need to think on it.**" he says to the droid, reassembling his sidearm and holstering it. "**I'll be seeing you again soon.**"
He moves to the front of the shop, stepping carefully around where the fallen SBD had tipped over some displays. He heads back to the *Gladiators Rest*, where he can check in with Trix and do a little research on his Arena Pad. The doctor's orders were to take it easy for a bit, and while Kaz was sure he'd see them again in the near future, he didn't care to make it tomorrow.
*Even the best blaster in the world is of limited use to a fighter with a limp.*

Yeah, I actually had the double-barrel as next on my list to check out, but since I don't want to spend all my credits before my second match, and because Kaz isn't trained in *rifles*, I think I'll just skip the whole thing right now. I didn't write in what Kaz is going to do at the GR because I'm not sure if you have anything planned for the interim. If not, you can just get me there and I'll post again the specifics once I arrive. I plan on taking a day to rest up, and to do some of those other things mentioned.
As an aside, is there anyplace where Kaz can get some flowers or something? I'm thinking it could be cool to place a blue rose with orange highlights on my defeated enemies in the Arena. Or something like that anyway. I can RP that too if you're up for it.

A block or so down the street from Goodo's Munitions and Supply Kaz sees an odd sight: leaning against a street light is the Thakwaash. It stands tall, instead of the stooped posture it had in the shop, and though wearing the same clothing it is worn differently: the overlong sleeves are rolled up to the elbow, it is loosened in a casual way around the neck instead of fastened all the way, and the long tail of the shirt is tucked in, revealing a utility belt and some kind of weapon. As he looks on, the Thakwaash throws its head back in laughter, guffawing at something said to him by the scantily clad Umbaran before him. The Umbaran grins back, and soon the two are walking towards Kaz, the Thakwaash's arm over her shoulders, nuzzling and whispering in one another's ears. Kaz can see the Tier Six badge now on the Thakwaash's chest, and as they near him the Thakwaash meets his eyes briefly. Other than a small quirk of the brow, the massive creature gives no indication of recognition.

Yeah, its a rifle. They have an upgrade called a folding stock. When you fold the stock on a rifle you treat it as a pistol for the purposes of range and proficiency. If you like, you can move onto the GR, Trix should be on duty in an hour or so, its getting towards late afternoon

*Tier Six? I'll be seeing you again.* Kaz thinks, nodding politely and continuing on his way.
Entering the *Gladiator's Rest*, he grabs a seat at the bar and pulls out his Arena Pad. Trix should be back soon, but in the meantime Kaz wants to figure out who this Thakwaash is - if he's really anybody at all. Reviewing the events of the last couple hours, he punches in some search queries and waits for someone to appear from behind the counter.
*He's Tier Six, which means he's pretty new to the Arena - but he's not dead yet, which means he might be a decent fighter.*
The initial meds are starting to wear off a bit from all the walking, and Kaz figures it'll be time to head back to his room soon to put his leg up. He makes a mental note to check out Goodo's prices on other weaponry before heading back there tomorrow. The Pad might be useful for that too. Pistols and knives are all he brought with him because it's all he can really handle, but Kaz saw a couple other things that might be useful when he was in the shop. A double-barrel carbine would pack more punch than his blaster, and if he could manage to get a folding stock fitted on it might just handle enough like a sidearm.
*It's sure to be pricey, but I've got lots to barter with. I'll have to clean up the electropole just a bit though - it wouldn't do to try and sell something with blood on it, especially if it's my own…*

Kaz finds very little on the massive furred being, although he begins to work out how the system works. He finds himself by searching the recent matches at the Arena he fought in, under "Blue Devil" with one win, zero losses, one head-shot and one kill. As he browses the higher Tiers he finds genuine names and much more detail, so it seems that the administrators don't bother with such until a gladiator has been around for a while.
His search for weaponry leaves him trapped in the everlasting clicking of advertising links, and roughly two hours later he finds himself looking at a silver-plated rotary blaster cannon with electrum detailing, matching backpack generator, and stylish display stand for the low low price of several million credits. A slim pink hand's fingers snap between him and the screen, breaking the hypnotizing hold. Kaz looks up to find Trix's impish grin.

"**I bet your day wasn't as exciting as mine…**" he motions to his leg, still bandaged. "**…but you should've seen the other guy. Anyway, I've been trying to identify a lovely schizophrenic local I ran into today. To be more precise, he ran *from* me - and made quite the scene too. A Thakwaash, if I'm not mistaken, and he was wearing a Tier Six badge. I suppose I'll run into him again, inside or outside of the Arena.**"
A dull throbbing of pain begins to make itself known once again as Kaz stands up.
"**I've got to rest up a bit - doctor's orders. If you happen to get any leads on that Hutt I mentioned earlier - Slomo - feel free to stop by my room. I'm sure you've got a spare key around here somewhere…?**" he returns her impish grin.
*Nothing wrong with making a few friends while I'm here*, thinks Kaz, *but let's not forget why we're here in the first place…Lora.*
Kaz waits to see if Trix has any response before heading back to his room.

I plan on resting for the rest of the evening, and most of the next day - or at least the morning. I'm not sure when Kaz is supposed to be back at full HP, so just let me know.

**"What's a Thakwaash? And if its a gladiator it probably isn't local. Most of the locals are too poor to outfit themselves to compete. As for Slomo, she isn't kin to Goodo, she's from a different clan. What I hear is she sponsors a team on Tier 3 though,"** she says as she fills an order for another patron. The bar area is starting to fill with a motley collection of gladiators and the tourists and groupies who follow them. **"Aw, sweetie I rarely do any entertaining any more, but if I did I doubt you could afford it,"** she finishes with a sultry smile and a roll of well defined hips as she moves, **"The Red Room is open though if you like.

*Tier Three, huh? That's going to be some work alright.*
"**Not what I meant, but maybe you've never entertained a real Zabrak.**" Kaz says with a wink. "**And thanks for that tip about Slomo, the Blue Demon has quite a promising career ahead and I'm sure we'll be meeting soon enough. I'll pass on the meal for right now, but maybe I'll be out for a late bite this evening.**" He waves goodnight to Trix as the patrons begin to fill the tables and heads down the hallway.
Back in his room, Kaz rests on his bed lets the events of the day wash over him with no particular intent. He naps hard for a little over an hour, then wakes slowly. His thoughts turn to Lora, his sister, and the games they'd played as children. They were close growing up and as time passed they didn't see each other as much - life sometimes does that. Their bond was a strong one though, and while he hadn't seen her for several weeks before her disappearance Kaz dropped everything to search for her.
*And now I've found you, dear sister. So close and yet so distant. I will save you, though, from that monster. I will pay your ransom and then I will exact my own price.*
With such thoughts, Kaz couldn't get back to sleep right away. He reached for the electropole and began to clean his blood off the point. He really needed to get as much as he could for trade-in, and every little bit helped. He planned on keeping his original wager - the flamethrower and grenades - for a little longer. They might become useful later on. The electropole was of no interest to Kaz though, and he'd take what he could get for it tomorrow. Perhaps he was a bit too ambitious trying to improve his arsenal already anyway. It wasn't a bad sidearm, it was just a few unlucky shots against the Ubese. He'd get better at that.
*The Blue Demon will haunt this Arena in the days ahead, and he will only be satisfied with the death of Slomo the Hutt.*
With the shadow of revenge creeping over his mind, Kaz drifts away once more. This time, he dreams of battle - wave after wave of enemies come after him, some without faces, some resembling the Thakwaash from earlier. He fights a hopeless battle fueled by rage and fear with his woefully inadequate pistol. He is eventually overcome by the hordes and as darkness closes in he hears Lora's voice calling out for him.
*"**Kaz! Kaz, help me! Where are you, brother?! Kaz!**"*
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

So I'll have Kaz sleep in and catch a brunch before heading back to Goodo's Munition and Supply to barter a bit more. I'll adjust the HP total in a moment. If you don't have anything planned for the evening, just post a quick morning intro and I'll RP that too. I just don't want to skip too far ahead.
And frankly, I'm not sure any of my characters should expect a full night's sleep if you're GMing... ![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)

Kaz's night passes uneventfully in spite of the party in the bar and comings and goings from the Red Room and rental rooms. The next morning he rises and is greeted by a Zygerrian female with dainty horns and her hair in dozens of braids who takes his order and fills it. He polishes off another amazing breakfast and makes his plans for the day...

## Re: A Bright-Eyed Demon Comes o' Calling

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-20 11:19:39)

The pain in his leg all but gone, Kaz finishes his omelette - quickly becoming the highlight of his day - and heads back to his room. He gathers all his gear and sets off for Goodo's Munitions and Supply. Using the electropole to lean on just a bit helps cover his very slight limp - caused mostly because his wound had all night to set and the leg is a little stiff. He makes his way through the morning crowds and finally arrives at his destination.
*Here we go, time to put on the charm…*
Entering the shop, Kaz makes his way to the counter and sets the electropole and electrograpple handle down. Looking square at the attending droid, Kaz inquires confidently:
"**Good morning friend! I'm curious what this fine piece of weaponry is worth to you - can you give me an offer?**"
He knows droids aren't likely to haggle with the price much, but he needs to see what it's worth here so he can either find a smaller shop that might be willing to give more or ask for an actual salesperson to haggle with. He'd rather give the business to someone not employed by Goodo, but they may not be listed in the Arena Pad and might take some searching out.
*And I don't have all day to fence weapons, I need to get back in the Arena. The Blue Demon doesn't take days off.*

The shop is much the same as it was yesterday, with SBDs on guard duty and the smith/cashier behind the counter. The Droid takes the electropole and analyzes it, saying, **"Depleted energy source, carbon scoring, carry marks and well worn glove. Very clean, well maintained. One thousand credits,"** while he points these things out to Kaz.

Okay, there will be a new rule in the Regs thread, and you're the first to come across this. Since you attempted to clean it and the droid told you exactly what was wrong with it, you can take it elsewhere and make the Deception check, then try and sell it to another vendor without the required Knowledge Technology check.

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-27 16:33:18)

"**1,000 credits? Hmm.**"
Kaz ponders the offer for a moment, realizing full well that the weapon passed as an acceptable wager yesterday, and the only use it's seen since then was by the Ubese. He understands how profit works, but considering the likely mark-up he decides to try and find a better deal somewhere.
"**Thanks for taking a look, but I believe I'll head elsewhere. Maybe someone with eyeballs will be willing to give it a better appraisal.**" He smiles at the jest, knowing the humor is probably lost on the droid. Kaz exits the shop and begins to look for any smaller, privately-owned establishments that deal in weaponry. Certainly few can compete with Goodo's resources, but there's always someone just trying to make a living in a place like this - and they usually don't last long.
*There's got to be someone willing to strike a deal, even if it's more long-term. A place to get patched up for free, or even just to recharge power packs would be perfect.*

Okay. Kaz is looking for something close to a "Mom and Pop", but any other shops will suffice.

Kaz can't seem to find any shops, but after asking around is directed a few blocks back to one he had walked past twice. Roar's Big Wookie Weapons is a ramshackle place, with odd species mounted on the walls and tables heaped with all manner of eccentric weaponry.
Behind the counter stands a scarred protocol droid who welcomes the new customer, **"Greetings and welcome to Roar's Big Wookie Weapons Shop. Roar, the proprietor, is currently away on chapter business-"** the droid's speech is interrupted by a mournful howling as a Wookie appears from the stairway in the back, looking ill-kept and hungover. **"Oh my! Well, here is master Roar now-"** and the large cinnamon Wookie lives up to his name as he thunders at the droid, rattling most of the shop. The droid scurries off and the Wookie approaches the counter and sits on a stool behind it. He lifts a vox-box and presses several buttons, and the box says several phrases in a metallic voice:
**"Welcome!"**
**"My name is Roarrowoken, or Roar for short, owner and proprietor of this establishment."**
**"How may we assist you?"**

### **BWS2K** (2011-06-02 20:27:10)

*How in the world did I miss this place?*
As the droid hurries away, Kaz sizes up the owner. He seems just a bit tipsy, or else more eccentric than the average Wookie. Probably both.
"**Greetings to you, friend!**" Kaz replies with a smile, nodding his head in a polite display of deference. "**My name is Kaz Torev and I, too, am something of a entrepreneur. I've recently thrown my lot in at the Arena,**" he motions to his badge, "**and am searching for just the right business-minded individual to enter into a partnership - mutually beneficial, of course.**" He pauses for effect, and to let Roar begin to digest the idea.
"**My proposal is a simple one: I will secure you equipment in the form of wagers won from my unfortunate opponents for you to sell or barter as you see fit. This would be at no charge to you, and I will enter a match no less than once every other day. For your part, I would ask for access to any medical supplies you may come across, and perhaps the honor of testing any custom weaponry you may produce. In time I'm certain our partnership would prove most satisfactory to both of us.**"
*He definitely gets the lion's share of the deal, but it'll be worth it in the long run if I can score some weapons modifications.*
"**As a gesture of good faith, and to show my commitment to our future prosperity, I offer this electropole and gauntlet - easily worth 1,000 credits - absolutely free. I can vouch for it's effectiveness,**" Kaz stands back and points to his bandaged leg, smiling somewhat sheepishly, "**but the late owner was easily distracted and unworthy of wielding it.**"
His mind's eye flashes back to the crumbled Ubese opponent lying maskless, twitching in the throes of death on the Arena floor.
"**So what say you? The mighty Roar and his Blue Demon gladiator could make a powerful duo…**" He let's that last sentence linger for moment and waits for a reply.
**Persuasion +7** to put on the charm for Roar...

The Wookie listens, one hairy hand on his head, and then takes the offered weapon. He looks it over, grumbling to himself, before setting it behind the counter. He sits, holding his head with both hands, until the droid returns with a tray laden with caf and sweet meats. Roar tears into the tray, mumbling around mouthfuls of food occasionally, never looking away from the tray. The droid translates, **"Oh my, aherm… Master Roar says your token of good faith is appreciated, now please purchase something or leave-"** the droid is cut off by a roar that rattles the equipment racks and a look from his owner that seems to suggest that droids are edible. The droid hastily continues, **"Actually, he said 'thanks, now buy something or get out,'"** as it backs away from the hungover Wookie.

Kaz quickly finds his way back to the Arena closest to the *Rest*, and finds his way inside. As he enters the main lobby it looks almost empty at this mid-morning hour, and the Thakwaash leans against the counter of the droid that arranges matches. He still has the casual/professional air about him as he chats with a Nautolan. They are the only two there, so the display board can clearly be seen.
Nautolan: Flechette Launcher with Slinker 1500
Gran: Heavy Blaster Pistol with Double Trigger and Environmental Sealing 1500
Human: Heavy Blaster Rifle 1500
The betting droid has more customers than his counterpart, but still a paltry few.

## Re: A Bright-Eyed Demon Comes o' Calling

Knowing the Thakwaash to be another Arena combatant, Kaz decides to leave well-enough alone for now. Looking past him to the board, he reads the entries.
*Nautolans are tough - I wonder if it's the one at the counter? Humans are unpredictable at best and dangerously irrational at worst. Three eyes can't hurt a Gran's chances in a fight, but that pistol looks nice. Roar might be interested in it, or mine if it proves superior.*
Kaz steps up to the counter, careful to appear non-chalant, and addresses the droid: "**Greetings again! I'd like to enter against that Gran, if you please. Here's my wager.**"
He places the flamethrower and pack of grenades on the counter gently. While waiting for the droid's directions, Kaz tries intently to make out the conversation nearby.

The droid rescans the gear, accepting it and giving the same admonition it did last time about not using explosive wagers during matches, then directs Kaz to pit 5. The conversation seems amicable, and average. The two seem to be discussing the night life of Killee-Kor and how it serves to ease the stress of combat.

*The stress of combat? Losing could be stressful I suppose, but then death does tend to wreak havoc on the nerves…*
"**Thanks. See ya 'round!**" Kaz replies to the droid, with a wave. He sets off for Pit 5 and begins to wonder once again what lies ahead. Every good gladiator thinks about the match ahead, but Kaz only has one victory so far.
*The first of many. Failure can't be an option here, Lora's life depends on it. Yes, I haven't forgotten you sister. I would die for you - but maybe not today.*
As he walks the passageway to the gate, Kaz remembers a phrase uttered by the elder who oversaw the inscribing of his j'ati: "*Menitul ku akhoi.*" Perhaps he was looking forward to his participation in this Arena? Some people have been known to foresee the future - those strong in the Force - but Kaz had never met anyone like that personally. If his destiny was to become the Arena Champion that was just fine with him.
*And no matter how many of Slomo's thugs I have to step on to get there I will free my sister. Menitul ku akhoi - There can be only one.*

Kaz makes his way to his designated pit, and after the same speech from a similar Arena employee finds himself looking through a grate at an open pit with scattered shields erected. He hears and odd hydraulic noise, reminiscent of a starship's doors opening and closing in the distance.
The Arena Announcer's voice comes booming over the intercom, **"COME ONE, COME ALL, AND WELCOME TO THE ARENA!!!"** he pauses briefly for the fitful cheers and jeers of the sparse crowd. **"OUR FAVORITE BLUE DEMON HAS RETURNED!! TODAY HE FACES A GRAN GUNSLINGER. IS HE TOUGH ENOUGH TO OUT-SHOOT THIS THREE EYED MENACE? LET'S FIND OUT!! LET THE BATTLE BEGIN!!!"**

you won the initiative so you may act first. the nades and flamer stay with you but you can't use the nades during the match.
The shields are about 2 squares tall, so three meters. being behind one where your enemy can't draw a line (See combat in core book) grants total cover and concealment. neither of you can see the other yet, and you still aren't sure what the noise is, though you can see the two platforms on either side of the chasm (the one you don't know is a chasm yet. you know what i mean). the first map i tried for days and it just wouldn't work so this is the one you get. its dynamic at least.

The sound intrigues Kaz, but he dismisses it as either unimportant for the moment or a mere distraction. It's encouraging to hear the few cheers that erupt at his appearance, though the unenthusiastic majority doesn't surprise him. They'll be cheering soon enough. He takes the opportunity to gather his wits and recites the Elder's words under his breath: "***Menitul ku akhoi - there can be only one.***"
Kaz goes into a crouch and sets the flamethrower and grenades on the ground. The dull ache in his leg is non-existent now, the rising adrenaline having soothed the last minor pains.
*No sense in bringing these along, they'll only slow me down. The temptation to lob one of these over the shields is great, but I can't imagine the Arena rules are very favorable to gladiators who expend wagered items - even if it is their favorite Blue Demon.*

Kaz lowers his package to the floor and draws his pistol, warily looking towards the shields ahead when the metal scream of advanced hydraulics comes again, and he sees both platforms disappear from view. In front of the large shield he can see a dark blob, presumably the new position of the platforms. Of his opponent, there is still no sign.

Thankful for the prospect of not being skewered again, Kaz decides on a conservative open to the match. He hurries over to the middle shield and rolls out prone just far enough to get a decent view of the pit. He's not overexposed though, with plenty of cover to his right should he need to retreat hastily. Raising his blaster pistol in both hands, he scans the other side carefully for his target.

Kaz squeezes off his shot, scoring a shocked grunt of pain and causing the Gran to jump behind the nearest shield.

The partial bolt that passes through the shield burns into Kaz's forearm, but it's power was mostly spent and he is unmoved. Realizing stalemates are not very exciting to watch and yet not too anxious to lose his life just yet, Kaz rolls to the left and prepares to fire on the Gran. The thought occurs that a thrown grenade, though inactive, might have succeeded in flushing out his opponent. A strategy for next time, no doubt.

Another squeal of pain is punctuated by the cheering crowd and a return shot that misses horribly. The wounded being proves to be a swift learner, dropping flat and inching in closer to his shield. As Kaz sees his strategy stolen he hears the shriek again, and the platforms change positions for the third time.

He pulls away from the mic, flashing a devious grin and waving once more to his fans. Kaz collects his belongings and makes his way out of the Arena. Making his way through the streets to Roar's shop he examines the Gran's blaster pistol.
*This is a nice little trinket,* he thinks as he checks out his new sidearm, *The Blue Demon might have some use for something like it, but I think Roar might appreciate it more. And an unhappy Wookie partner is worse than anything in the Arena.*
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, so I'll update my character sheet tonight after work. I plan on giving the new pistol to Roar, so if you put me in my own water map after I pass up an environmentally sealed sidearm I have no one to blame but myself, lol! Either way, I didn't want to fast-forward to the shop in case you had something in mind between the Arena and there, but I'd like a chance to improve my standing with Roar again when Kaz gets there.

At his remarks the crowd roars again, the Blue Demon already a local favorite. Soon Kaz had his new pistol and was making his way from the pit when accosted by a young Twi'lek male who intrepidly asks for an autoprint from the Blue Demon himself. By the bookie's desk, Kaz can see the Thakwaash collecting a tidy sum as the tall wiry being gives him a wink and a grin while counting his credits.
After making his way from the Arena Kaz enjoys a quick meal and night's sleep, waking to feel rested and ready for the test ahead.
Kaz quickly finds his way back to Roar's Big Wookie Weapons Shop. On entering the droid gives a generic greeting and Kaz can see Roar himself, looking much more alert, hunched over a workbench working on a high quality hunting rifle accented in dark, expensive greel wood.

Seeing Roar busy, Kaz is hesitant to interrupt at first and approaches in a manner so as not to startle the recently hungover Wookie. The craftsmanship on the rifle is superb and he would hate to experience its effectiveness firsthand. Watching Roar work for a few moments, Kaz decides to speak up:
"**Ah, the master at his craft. Surely your partnership with a humble Zabrak gladiator can only be an act of generosity, since it is so clearly not necessary to your success. But I've had a measure of success this morning too…**"
Reaching into his belt for the Gran's sidearm, Kaz presents the weapon to Roar according to the terms of their agreement.
"**The Gran who wielded it was unworthy of such a weapon, and his battle prowess was exceeded only by his horrible accuracy.**"

Roar grumbles and looks at Kaz, his eyes showing a not so welcome recognition. He begins to warble and growl complainingly, until Kaz places the blaster before him. He stops, looking at the blaster, and lifts it while giving Kaz a suspicious look. He begins grunting and growling again, and the droid steps forward and begins translating: **"What, by the Force, is wrong with this blue idio-"** Its translation cut off by a roar from the Wookie.
**"I'm sorry master, I didn't realize that wasn't meant to be translated I-"** it stutters, quickly cut off by more howling and wall shaking bellows. The Wookie shakes his head exasperatedly, his eyes rolling towards the ceiling. He barks more at the droid who then leaves, and beckons Kaz to follow him.
The two only cross the room to the counter where Roar hands a stool across to Kaz and gestures for him to sit before doing so himself. He places the pistol on the counter between them. The droid soon returns bearing a tray of caf and tabac, and Roar grumbles quietly as he lifts an old hand carved pipe and packs it while the droid pours two cups of caf, placing one before Kaz. As the droid works it translates, **"Master Roarrowoken wishes to know what you want. He does not deal in medical supplies, and believes such open ended deals such as you suggested yesterday to be folly."** As the droid finishes Roar lights his pipe puffing contentedly before pushing the tabac tray containing papers and another, less intricate, pipe towards Kaz. He sips from his caf and gives the Zabrak a calculating stare.

Kaz returns Roar's gaze and nods, resigned to the fact that even Blue Demons make mistakes sometimes. He reaches for the offered pipe and spends some time packing it, choosing his next words with care.
*It's about time I let **someone** know why I'm here…*
Kaz exhales slowly and in a tone of equal parts seriousness and honesty, he begins:
"**Very well. Perhaps it was folly, but I am no fool. I'm here in Killee-Kor for one purpose and one purpose only: a Hutt named Slomo has kidnapped my sister and I've been *offered* the chance to pay a ransom. It's an outrageously unreasonable sum of course, and even in the Arena it would take far too long to win. But it just might be possible to figure something out while I'm here that would… suffice.**"
Sipping on his caf and savoring the odd but not displeasing mixture of the drink and tobac, Kaz continues...
"**I was injured in my first Arena match, so naturally medical supplies were on my mind yesterday, and I was looking for a shop without connections to the Hutts. My ambition got the best of me it seems, and in my haste to gain an ally I rushed for a fool's bargain. While you are clearly many things Roarrowoken, a Mimwen surgeon is not one of them.**"
Kaz chuckles at his understatement and hopes the Wookie can appreciate the humour. Comfortable with having shared his motives, Kaz moves on to matters at hand...
"**So. That's why I'm in Killee-Kor, and that's why a a bright-eyed demon would make such a terrible deal and start giving you weapons for free. To be honest, I'm not sure what I could have hoped for here, but I'm very content to have gained some experience and, maybe, a friend. I stand by my word, and the pistol is yours even if the bargain is ended - or you can give me a fair price if you prefer. I have no interest whatsoever in anything Goodo's pushing, and I can't imagine any other shops offer caf and tobac for their patrons, so…**" Kaz grins and takes a final sip of his drink.
"**You asked what I want. I want Lora back. I want a shot at Slomo and his goons. I want a way to accomplish both of those goals. Maybe what I want, maybe what I *need*…**" he says, smiling widely and glancing around the store, "**…is some big Wookie weapons.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Aaaaand I'm spent. I'm leaving the conversation somewhat open-ended in the event that you have a response in mind, but unless I've totally misread the "calculating stare" this should mostly explain what Kaz's motivations are, even if he forgot them momentarily. I don't mind continuing though, if Roar has questions or if you just want to have a bit of conversation after slinging little yellow balls of light (Farscape **rocks**) across a Canyon Of Infinite Falling. If not, you can just have them finish up and put me at the *Gladiator's Rest*. I'm content to just have Roar as a friend and go-to for barter and buying, but if he knows any crazy Thaakwashes, feel free to share... ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

The tufts of hair lining Roar's eyebrows do strange, strange things as he listens to Kaz's story. First they climb his forehead, then drop low, then screw themselves up in incredulity at the end. He places his palms over his eyes and begins grumbling and the droid begins translating. **"First Sith, and now some random Zabrak decides to wander in here and tell me his life story, and wants my help taking on a Hutt? What is this city coming to? Has the whole planet gone insane? Damn you droid stop translating! Oh my! My apologies, master Roar."**
The Wookie gives the droid an ill look before standing and beckoning to Kaz. He leads the Zabrak to the back of the shop, where Kaz sees a small shooting range built along the back wall. Once there he rummages through several drawers and boxes, coming up with a pistol fashioned of metal and rich, warm wood. The barrel and body are almost as long as Kaz's forearm, and it fits Roar's hand perfectly. He points it down range and squeezes the trigger. **Crack-KOOM!!!** The target at the far end of the range disintegrates, and the massive report hurts Kaz's ears. The Wookie looks at Kaz and then moves to the target, digging through the remains to pull out a massive slug, which he tosses to the Zabrak.
In Kaz's hands lays a bent and twisted piece of metal the size of one of his fingers, still burningly hot from its recent trip at an incredibly high speed. Roar hands the pistol to Kaz, and its weight is surprising. It almost requires two hands, and has very effective sights that still manage to be aesthetically pleasing. Roar points out the mechanisms and the droid translates: **"This is an older Wookie design, this cylinder holds the ammunition,"** he says, showing Kaz how to rotate the cylinder out of the weapon, **"And it hold six rounds at a time. You can squeeze the trigger, or cock the hammer and then squeeze, which lessens the trigger pull,"** he tells him, demonstrating. **"It bucks like a kybuk, and most think slugththrowers are obsolete, but they do respectable damage and ignore shields. Here's a box of twenty rounds, take it and good luck,"** the droid translates as Roar hands him the box and a belt and holster big enough for him to wear as a bandolier.

Wookie Sidearm 2d8+5 damage, has Superior Damage and a Double Trigger. Capacity of 6 and weight 3 kilos, otherwise treat as Heavy Slugthrower Pistol page 38 UR. Box of 20 rounds for free, additional boxes will cost 100 credits.

Kaz slings the over-sized belt holster over his shoulder and adjusts it to fit his less-than-Wookie frame. He takes the time to insert the rounds into its pockets and places the box on the table. Turning the pistol over in his hands, he admires the fine craftsmanship in the weapon.
"**Thank you, Roar. Surely this is a weapon for the Blue Demon…**" he replies, working the action for himself. He holsters it and looks back up at the Wookie and his droid. "**Thank you again. I trust our paths will cross again in the near future, but for now I bid you farewell.**" Kaz bows slightly, gathers his gear and heads for the Arena. As he walks the crowded streets he takes note that Killee-Kor is quite an amazing city in itself. So much life happening all around him, based largely on the death of others.
*Rav must have made enough for a hundred lifetimes of riches off this place.*
He enters the lobby and searches for the now familiar Thakwaash.
*I suppose a duel might be in order, though I'm not likely to learn much about him if he's dead.*
He takes a look at the available matches on the board, wondering what new surprises the Arena has in store for today.

As Kaz leaves the shop he hears Roar grumbling softly in a bewildered tone. His droid replies, **"Yes Master, he did say he would be back."** Kaz can hear a plaintive wail from the Wookie. **"But Master, where else would he acquire ammunition for the weapon you gave him?"** As the door shuts Kaz can hear what sounds like a fully grown Wookie sobbing...
Kaz reaches the Arena to find it much as he left it the day before, but busier. For the hour the place should be relatively quiet, but a large number of beings wander the halls to and from the spectators areas. The betting droid is busier as well, and the match arranging droid works steadily at his console, the recent matches outcomes scrolling across his screen as he punches in new challengers. According to the readout, the Thakwaash just won a Crucible match against a group of B1 battle droids. The available matches screen shows these matches:
Shistavanen Sniper Blaster Rifle 2500 purse
Zygerrian 2000 credits, 2500 purse
Nautonal Blastech DT-12 blaster pistol with improved accuracy and standard targeting scope 2500 purse

## Re: A Bright-Eyed Demon Comes o' Calling

### **BWS2K** (2011-08-05 13:06:03)

As Kaz reads the matchboard, he notices the Zygerrian hasn't wagered an actual item. That, coupled with what he's heard of both Nautolans and Shistavanens being able to see in the dark, makes his decision easier. He doesn't need any more weaponry, after all, but the money can be used to purchase ammunition, or for bribes, or for some kind of armor - which Kaz notes may be of immeasurable value in future matches.
*And being a slaver race, perhaps beating the Zygerrian will send a clear message to whoever took Lora.*
He approaches the counter and holds up his new sidearm for the droid to scan. The weapon feels good in his hand and he once again marvels at Roar's marksmanship. Unlike his blaster pistol, which is mostly metallic and somewhat bulky, the Wookie design seems perfectly balanced - even if wielded in a smaller hand.
"**The Blue Demon has chosen his next victim. I'll take the Zygerrian match if you please.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Like I said in OOC, I'll edit whatever wager works. I should have asked what the pistol cost when Roar gave it to Kaz, but I'm pretty sure it'll work. In that case he'll probably be ditching the flamethrower but keeping the grenades. Also, I'll be purchasing armor soon I think, in case anyone gets any ideas. This looks neat:
[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Armored_flight_suit](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Armored_flight_suit "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Armored_flight_suit")
and it's already blue, but it reeks of outdated 80's-ish style. Something close though, maybe with a blue/orange scheme. I'll leave the details to you. The corebook states that an armored flight suit provides protection against hostile environments - would this include being underwater by any chance? Assuming a Zabrak could get the helmet on...

An older, grizzled human veteran leaning on the bar next to him hears Kaz's declaration and speaks, **"Mind yourself in there youngster, you ain't the only demon ta come through these parts.

"**Thanks. I'll let you know how he does…**" Kaz replies to the veteran gladiator with a wink.
Gathering his gear, he heads down the hall to the assigned pit and prepares for his next match.
*Maybe I can finally put these to good use…* thinks Kaz, stuffing the frag grenades into his pockets where they can be easily reached.
He checks that both sidearms are snug in their holsters and ready for action, the blaster pistol resting on his right hip and the Wookie belt slung across his chest with the weapon riding just under his left arm. The flamethrower hasn't seen any action lately, and Kaz takes the time to look it over before bringing the strap to rest over his left shoulder. Satisfied with his armament, Kaz takes a deep breath and exhales slowly.

The old man just shakes his head, and Kaz quickly finds himself greeted by the same beat up droid, or one just like it. The droid stands beside a cage, not a door, and gives Kaz the same recorded speech before opening the cage.
After stepping inside, the floor opens beneath the cage and Kaz finds himself lowered about twenty meters through darkness, a faint light beneath him. As he reaches the light he can see the pit for the first time, a watery coliseum. His cage sets him on a pillar on one side, and he can see his opponent across the pit from him. The pillar he stands on is three meters tall, and the pit itself fairly small. Dark water surrounds the columns and square pit in the center, and there is a narrow walkway around the water. The pit walls are roughly six meters high, and Kaz can see the small stands are packed with cheering fans.
His opponent is a younger Zygerrian male with bright red dred-locked hair, his body covered by a floor length cape. As the cages open he steps out and with a flourish rips away the cape, revealing that he is wearing tight-fitting pants and nothing else, save a holstered blaster pistol. It is obvious he has taken great pains with his appearance, and his figure is in excellent shape. Rippling pale muscle covers his arms and legs, and his stomach flows with tight abs and chiseled hips. His fine-boned features are enhanced by the vestigial horns adorning his head and face, and his eyes carry a mirth as if he knows the punchline to the Great Cosmic Joke.
The announcer's voice crackles across the pit's amplifiers, **"COME ONE, COME ALL TO THE KILLEE-KOR ARENA!! TODAY, OUR TWO MOST POPULAR NEW GLADIATORS FACE OFF IN A FIGHT TO THE FINISH!!! WHO WILL WIN?!?! OUR BLUE DEMON OR OUR RED DEVIL?!?!? AHAHAHA!! LET'S FIND OUT!!

As the cage lifts away and Kaz gets a full view of the pit he realizes the flamethrower may not be seeing much action after all. His gaze sweeps the spectators and finally lands on his opponent. He stifles a laugh which trickles out as a mere chuckle when the Zygerrian throws his cape to the side, revealing a very unique spectacle indeed. Today's crowd is clearly in for a treat.
The announcer's voice fades as the microphone raises for Kaz's opening words. A myriad of taunts flash through his mind, most prominently the simple phrase "*Nice pants*", but he knows these people didn't just pay for insults - they want a show. And that's just what Kaz plans on giving them.
"**Red Devil is it? How quaint.**" he begins, addressing the crowd more than the half-naked Zygerrian. "**Imitation really *is* the sincerest form of flattery.**" Meeting the other gladiator's eyes, he continues in a much darker tone: "**Since telling you to go to Hell seems redundant…**" Kaz reaches for his flamethrower, deciding the theatrics are just too good to pass up. Raising it slowly in front of the microphone, he ignites the pilot flame with the characteristic popping noise echoing through the sound system.
"**…How about you just die slowly?**"

The Zygerrian takes the jibes with a subtle nod to Kaz and a small tight grin, acknowledging the hits. Once Kaz is done he takes the mic and begins a leisurely pacing atop his column, murmuring into the mic as if unaware that it is there, **"What the hells is a "Blue Demon" anyway? I've never heard of a sad or mopey denizen of Hell. Of course, if I were too poor for decent medical care and decent clothing I'd be "Blue" too. Of course, if my opening consisted of cliches and bad puns I'd probably be poor, and therefor that deep a shade of blue. What say you, citizens of Killee-Kor?!"** He asks as he razes his arms trying to rouse the crowds.
The crowds mostly ignore him, still chuckling at Kaz's quips.
The Zygerrian looks around, semi-concerned before speaking again, **"Oh, I see. They've seen me win a few and now think they know me. Citizens of Killee-Kor, you don't know me! Your women, well, your women want to know me! Don't you ladies?!"** He yells, picking up his pace and tossing his hair.
At this, the females in the crowd begin catcalling in dozens of languages and the males begin cursing in more.
**"Yes, that's right,"** the Zygerrian grins, arms aloft beckoning to his fans. **"The men of Killee-Kor call me Red Devil, but what do the women call me?!"** At which point a chorus of female (and not a few male) voices begin chanting **"INC-U-BUS! INC-U-BUS! INC-U-BUS!"**
Shortly the crowds noise level begins to drop, and the announcer's voice returns, **"THIS PROMISES TO BE INTERESTING, DOESN'T IT FOLKS?! WE'LL LET THEM KEEP THE MICS SHALL WE?"** he asks, which is answered by a thunderous roar from the crowd. **"SO BE IT! LET THE BATTLE BEGIN!!!"**

*Decent clothing? Like capes and tight pants?*
The crowd clearly shares Kaz's opinion of his flashy opponent, but as the Zygerrian begins to garner support from the females - and, Kaz notes, several males - a strategy forms in his mind.
Judging the distance to the main pedestal while the Red Devil drones on, Kaz prepares to one-up his overly colloquial nemesis. He takes a step back and waits for the announcer's voice to finish thundering over the loudspeaker. Just as it ends, Kaz sprints to the edge of his column and leaps through the air. At the apex of his jump he fires the flamethrower below him. The flames reach the ground seconds before he does, hissing loudly and throwing out massive clouds of steam. He lands on one knee at the nearest edge of the pedestal, splashing into the couple inches of water there and scattering small bits of smoldering napalm. Unfortunately he also manages to roll his left ankle. Kaz feels the distinctive *pop* of a dislocating joint, and does his best to hide the injury from his audience - and the Zygerrian - by favoring his other foot.
The effect is dramatic in the extreme, and even in the well-lit arena manages to give an other-worldy appearance to the Zabrak warrior within. The dark silohuette rises slowly through the tendrils of smoke and residual flame, bright orange eyes lending new meaning to his Hellish moniker. As the hissing dies and the microphone catches up to him, Kaz utters a single phrase. The words come out slowly and clearly:
"**Time to burn.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Deception +8** to hide the severe dislocation that Kaz receives upon landing. Here we go, apply whatever modifiers you think appropriate, what with all the smoke and splashing and clearly distracting shirtless opponents...
***3*** <- [3] 1d20
HP adjusted -5

**Okay, you want a Jump check? Look no further amigo…
***2*** <- [1] 1d20 + 1

***5*** <- [5] 1d6
…if I take damage I'll just re-re-edit in some text about Kaz rolling his ankle, but it won't be seen amidst the awesome display of pyrotechnics. And before you say it, clearly the flames would fall and fizzle before he actually drops through them. Good grief Mag, you think I'd fry my own character like that? What if those frag grenades *are* heat sensitive - they're strapped to Kaz's *chest*! In my best MacAulay Culkin voice: *I don't think so*.**
-=-=-=-
**Edit: Okay, I don't think I need to include an actual Attack Roll here, but that'll be my Standard Action. Without looking at the map I think I can manage backing up one space and then using a running jump to land on the very top edge of the main platform in the shallows. I'm running so it's a DC9, and I can take 10 I believe. Not sure if you want to grant some sort of concealment here, but I'm thinking most of the steam would dissapate very quickly anyway. There's 4 shots left in the canister, and I'm going with the "shoots a stream of napalmy goodness" type of flamethrower. Consider this post edited and otherwise unchanged.**
-=-=-=-
Okay big surprise - I couldn't wait to post. ![:))](https://i.ibb.co/ZRrbtNtj/icon-razz.gif) I'm going to go ahead and apologize for somewhat commandeering the crowd here, but they're sort of like a weapon to be wielded and I'm banking on a decent Persuasion roll. If I whiff it then feel free to turn to the heckling and whatnot. I can edit if you want.
**Move Action:** 5 down, 1 left. I want to end up above the top right of the closest pillar, and since I don't think I'd need to swim that little bit inbetween the two platforms I think I can make it in the normal 6 moves.
**Swift Action:** Persuasion +13, and I'll be adding a Force Point (there doesn't seem to be a *Creepy Stalker Fan* Feat in any of the books, but I'll take a couple of those if you like)...
***31*** <- [18] 1d20 + 13
FP:
***5*** <- [5] 1d6
**Standard Action:** Kaz will ready an attack with the flamethrower in the highly unlikely event that the Red Devil gets in range. I'm not sure how you want to work line of sight with it, but I think we can MacGuyver something. Here's Kaz's attack, but obviously it doesn't include the crowd modifiers you mention (although making the Zygerrian stupid enough to get close to Kaz might be a good enough modifier...):
**Flamethrower PBR +4** (3d6+2)
***12*** <- [2, 6, 2] 3d6 + 2

Kaz runs and jumps, splashing napalm into water and creating copious amounts of steam. Unfortunately, while the steam hides the fact that he lands badly from view, it doesn't stop it from being heard. He lands with a thud, thwack, and a pop bringing laughter from his opponent and the crowd. He soon makes up for it though, standing allowing the steam to reveal his abyssal figure, light catching eyes first. Between this and his new challenge the crowd once again roars in his favor. He sets his flamethrower, ready for his foe's advance.
The Zygerrian steps backwards and begins his run. As he reaches the end of his column he leaps, tucking his head to his knees and twisting and flipping his body multiple times before landing flawlessly, both feet firmly on the ground and arms spread wide and thrown high, dred-locks thrashing against his back and he straightens. Kaz looses his flames, which miss badly and raise more steam. The Zygerrian doesn't move or flinch, milking the crowd. He then walks leisurely to his right towards the shorter column, commenting, **"How long must one cook blue-rare meat before its edible? Surely slightly longer than half charred half boiled eh?"** he says with a grin before disappearing from Kaz's line of sight. The crowd heckles his poor humor, but he does something while behind the pillar that generates many cheers from the females and roars of anger from the males.

The failed jump check to avoid damage and failed deception means the crowd knows, and their attitude drops a step. Persuasion is a success though, so they're back to neutral. Don't forget you aren't proficient with the FT, so a -5 penalty goes with every attack. You didn't hit the base DC of 10, so no damage. The crowd is now two steps in his favor, thanks to you helping him look magnificent by missing him while he stood completely still. You take a -2 moral penalty, for the next round, and he gains a +2.

*Well that's another leg injury to chalk up to inexperience…*
As the Zygerrian strolls behind the pillar Kaz walks up onto the main platform, careful not to further injure his ankle. The last tendrils of steam part as he moves to corner his opponent. The crowd's favor seems to still be somewhat evenly divided, though so far he's done nothing but waste ammunition and get hurt.
*…but somebody needs to start screaming or they'll loose interest fast.*
"**Oh trust me, this meal could be *very* hazardous to your health.**" he says, and closes the last two meters quickly. Leaning against the pillar, he lets loose another burst directly at the under-dressed (but clearly over-sexed) Red Devil.
"**Apologies to the ladies…**" shouts Kaz over the roar of the flames with a gesture of sympathy to the crowd and a quick motion to the Zygerrian, "**…but maybe this one's a little *too* hot to handle?**"

You hit like a champ, and he dove/fell in the water as a move action. He has concealment. The +2/-2 only applies on attacks, the crowd was hostile to you (-10 Persuasion) but are only unfriendly (-5) after your successful use of the flamethrower. With the -5, your persuasion failed, but your penalty on attacks is reduced to -1. The crowd is currently unfriendly to you, friendly to him.

*Finally!*
Kaz allows the audience to have their moment, not that anything he said could be heard over the reaction right now anyway. There's no chance of spotting the Zygerrian under the water, so he takes the opportunity to prepare for victory.
*Well the theatrics have paid off, so maybe it's time to switch to something a little more familiar…*
Leaning with his back against the pillar, Kaz retrieves his newly acquired weapon - Roar's Wookie Pistol - with his off-hand. Gesturing with both weapons wildly to the crowd he begins to ask rhetorically over-dramatic questions, complete with exaggerated facial expressions...
"**What - no reply? No witty retort for the ladies?**" Kaz shouts above the cheers and jeers, "**No fancy leaping dive with an acrobatic twist?**"
He waves the massive sidearm in plain sight of the audience and puts on a show of confidence, walking across the main pedestal - despite the throbbing pain in his ankle. He continues addressing the crowd:
"**Did I not *warn* you he was an imitation? A devil perhaps, but not of the flame retardant variety it would appear. Maybe he thought you wanted good looks and sarcasm and only wears a blaster to keep his pants up. Ladies and gentlemen, *I* am the Blue Demon and only *I* truly haunt this Arena. I'll give you what you paid for today - I'll give you a show you won't soon forget.**" he concludes by making a show of looking around the Arena.
"**That is, as soon as our crispy friend re-surfaces…**"

The crowd reacts well to Kaz's preemptive boasting, then quietens as they strain forward looking for the missing combatant.

Like the crowd, Kaz, too, searches the water for signs of his opponent. He lowers his flamethrower and let's it hang at his side. Gripping the over-seized sidearm with both hands he prepares to perforate the Zygerrian with Wookie bullets...

There is a gasp and screams from the crowd following a large splash off to Kaz's left as the Zygerrian seems to explode from the water. Kaz squeezes the trigger on his Wookie side-arm and it looses a piercing CRACK as the igniting agent goes off followed immediately by a roaring ***BOOM*** as the projectile leaves the long barrel and breaks the sound barrier. There is a crumbling sound from wall far above and to the right of the Zygerrian as Kaz's startled shot misses his opponent. In the Zygerrian's right had a blaster pistol goes off, it's retort unheard thanks to Kaz's cannon. The Zygerrian's return fire impacts the column close to Kaz before he dives back below the water and disappears again. The crowd roars and cheers at the unconventional tactics.

You succeeded in making them friendly, but his novel tactic has put them back at indifferent for both of you. Being over the edge and in the water grants him cover, and he used a move action to dive. On the updated map you'll be able to see where he was (not where he currently is).

Kaz doesn't even flinch as the Zygerrian's shot goes wide.
*So that's how you want to play, huh?*
"**Oh it's a *flying* fish! Well then. You need *special* bait to catch one of those…**"
Kaz keeps his pistol trained on the water and reaches for one of his fragmentation grenades. He holds it up in plain view of the crowd with a devious grin on his face.
"**I think this should do, don't you?**" he chuckles, stirring the audience even more. "**Ladies and gentlemen, the Blue Demon always keeps his word. I give you…**" his says his last words carefully, like the ringleader in the main ring of some spectacular circus show, "**…the Death of the Red Devil.**"
Kaz bows slightly and switching the pistol to his off-hand, pops out the pin on the explosive. His attention turns once more to the murky depths. His view narrows, his heart races, his body lies tense and ready to act. The energy coming from the crowd suddenly crashes upon his senses and he finds himself more alert than he thought possible. Whether he's becoming an Arena junkie or not he can't tell, but it's hard to focus on anything outside of this moment. He feels as if something big is about to happen - something of greater significance than just another victory.

The crowd, predominately the males cheer heartily at the sight of the grenade, while the females hiss and boo. Kaz watches the water closely, and at the first sign of a ripple lobs his grenade in a gentle underhanded arc, so that it reaches the water just as the Red Devil's head breaks the surface. A gurgling yell of pain can be heard over the flash and bang, and a lazer bolt lashes out from the smoking crater which misses badly. As the smoke clears Kaz can no longer see his opponent...

"**This flying fish has one *thick* skull! No matter, we have other bait. Let's try another one of these…**"

"**Maybe the fishy went belly-up?**"
He gets a few chuckles, and goes back to watching. The sudden audience reaction finally breaks the suspense. Turning to face the other end of the platform, Kaz keeps his weapons drawn and advances slowly. His eyes sweep every inch of ground for signs of the Zygerrian.

Kaz steps forward slowly, working the crowd as he goes, looking for his wayward opponent. The gasps and shouts of the crowd make him whip his head to the right, where he spots the badly wounded Red Devil against the column. Kaz swings his massive pistol around, and the deafening crack-KOOM!!! thunders again, tearing large chunks from the stone column as the shot misses its target badly. Kaz's eyes are now locked on his opponent, so he sees clearly that he mic is clipped to his pants, on the side closest to the column and hidden to the crowd. He also sees the Red Devil intentionally turn it off, and the Devil meets the Demon's eyes with a grin. The Devil gestures and begins walking forward, unarmed, speaking loudly enough that Kaz can hear him, acting as if speaking to the crowd.
**"Well, Blue Demon, how would you like to make ten thousand credits?"** he asks as he closes the distance and his left foot lashes out towards Kaz's head in a lightning quick side-step kick... That connects dramatically, snapping Kaz's head back viciously...

Kaz reels back at the unexpected kick, faltering back a step and nearly falling. He drops his grenade as he goes down but then draws the knife from his boot on his way back up. Using the momentum to spin around and face his opponent once more, he swings the blade in an attempt to accomplish a surprise attack of his own.

As Kaz stumbles and stoops for his knife the Zygerrian's knee rises to meet his lowered head. The being's knee feels more like a sledgehammer as it connects, throwing Kaz off balance and making his knife swipe miss badly.
**"A glory hound, eh? Too bad. We could have made millions together,"** the red-haired and horn-faced humanoid says as he spins, sending an elbow towards Kaz's already battered head. His flashy martial arts send the crowd cheering as his so-far successful opponent starts to falter.

His vision still blurry from the first kick, Kaz is definitely taking a beating from this close quarter fighting.
"**Yeah, you're probably right,**" he manages between deep breaths, "**…but we both know I would've killed you in the end anyway.**"
Kaz could think of a dozen different plans for victory at the moment, but not very many were as exciting as what he had planned. Knife in one hand, pistol in the other, he attempts to buy a little more time.
"**So really, if you think about it, this is just way easier. Plus - you won't be able to hog all the ladies. One last thing -**"
Again dropping his weapon, Kaz makes a quick movement to lose his knife and grab the last fragmentation grenade from his belt. He tries to feint as best he can to avoid the inevitable sucker punch and activates the explosive. Being kicked is the least of his worries though, as he then throws it to the ground at his feet. He shields his face as much as possible and waits for the detonation.

The experience was beyond pain and Kaz felt for a moment as if he had simply left his body altogether. It was a new and odd sensation for the fledgling gladiator. All thoughts of the match or tactics or victory were suspended in the few fleeting seconds before his limp body crashed to the ground and the darkness took him completely.
His last thought was almost not a *thought* at all. The final sight of his opponent burned and scarred but nonetheless victorious evoked a raw and primitive emotion in Kaz, one not uncommon in Rav's Arena: the overwhelming, all-consuming lust for vengeance - fueled by an embarrassingly shameful defeat.
