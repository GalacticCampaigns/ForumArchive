# Act I: Encounter at Carosi XII

### **Anazider** (2008-03-21 13:28:56)

A myriad of of colors blur and swirl together past the Bellerophon as it glides through hyperspace, its destination the peaceful world of Carosi XII. The Carosites are renown for their ability as skilled physicians and healers of both mental and physical illness.
It is because of this facility with medicine that Carosi medical supplies, in particular their massive hospital ships, are highly sought after throughout the galaxy. The Bellerophon is carrying a diplomatic envoy to the planet to renegotiate the annual trade contract between the Empire and the Carosi Federation.
Through the "Victory Without War" initiative, it is the Emperor's hope that a more profitable trade agreement will persuade the Carosi to end their neutral political stance, and finally join the Empire...
****************************************************
"I know he's pretty, but you're trying to fight'm, not mount'm! Keep your spacing, damn you!"
Sesaren's stinging quip elicits a round of chuckles and catcalls from the onlookers outlining the octagonal training ring. The spectators are a mixed lot, consisting mostly of Knights and those recruits awaiting their turn in "the Squall", as it is known amongst the trainees. Sprinkled in amongst the Imperial Knights are off-duty officers and crewmen, as well as a few diplomats from the Galactic Alliance and unaligned factions, all wanting to catch a glimpse of the legendary Imperial Knight training regimen.
In the center of the Squall stand two men locked in a mock-battle. One, tall, and golden-skinned with copper and blonde hair; the other another man of equal youth, and dark hair. Both wear padded training armor, meant to absorb some of the impact of the stun staves they wield. But it is still not enough to prevent bruises, and the mild shock from the staves lets both of the recruits know when they've made an error in judgement.
((The two sparring are Arik and Cyrian, while Esre and Kanner are in the crowd of onlookers. Both Arik and Cyrian are at half their current hit points due to subdual damage. Begin play, and have fun!))

Sesarenâ€™s barb directed at Cyrian causes Arik to smirk as he shuffles his feet to correct his opponentâ€™s error. Sure, he could take advantage of Cyrianâ€™s proximity to get in an easy blow, and in a real combat that would make Arik the victor. But in this spar, his opponent won't fall and he'll suffer just as many hits if he allows Cyrian to stay too close.
Arik isnâ€™t perfect, and certainly no expert with staves, so he has had his own share of dressing downs already this session. He has begun to find a distinct pleasure in someone else being on the receiving end. Nevertheless, he desires to perform well, not show up his opponent, and the smirk is quickly removed from his face.
*No pressure*, he thinks, swinging his stave up and right on the diagonal to block a strike and sending Cyrian dancing backward with a quick blow of his own towards the other manâ€™s ribs. *Only half the* Bellerophon  *watching us, including my entire squadron. And theyâ€™d just love to see me mess this up. Can't give them the satisfaction.*
*And itâ€™d be nice to give that new girl Buula a good first impression.*
Arikâ€™s head has already half-turned to look for the pretty girl when he realises what heâ€™s doing and where he is. Thankfully the same situational awareness that serves him so well in starfighter combat â€“ which, according to his Imperial Knight trainers, has actually always been an innate Force sense â€“ works for him here, and he manages a clumsy duck to avoid Cyrianâ€™s stave as it sweeps up at his head. Bringing his own weapon up in the defensive position Sesaren taught them before the spar began, it is all Arik can do to weather the next few blows and back off, alert once again and waiting for an opening.
The two of them circle, and Arik assesses his situation.
*Heâ€™s stronger than me â€“ that last volley left my arms tingling; and a little faster. I think I have him matched for endurance but heâ€™ll have me down first unless I think of something…*
*Oh, what the frakk. What will be, will be.*
Suddenly Arik surges forward, striking downward with his stave then flicking the bottom end up instead in the hope of getting under his opponentâ€™s guard.

Cyrian winces at the rebuke from the trainer. He corrects his distance and moves back into a gaurd position. He sees his opponent smile and he can feel the anger rising. He quickly lashes out at his distracted opponent who barely manages to duck.
*Gotta stay focused, can't let anger blind me. I can take this stuck up fighter jocky.*
Arik manages to block Cyrians next few strikes but Cyrian can feel the give in his arms with each strike. Cyrian switches to a double handed grip. He swings with all his might hoping to batter down his opponents defenses.
*It isn't pretty but it should do the job.*
(Attack +3 Dmg D6+4)

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-22 06:57:08)

The squall erupts in cheers overtime a blow is landed against either of the two sparring in the center ring. Many are whistling some even heckle the two, one stand in the corner amongst the other but apart.
Watching the match but not for entertainment rather yet another possible lesson to be learned Lothor half watches the match and half studies a data pad. Still in uniform his posture and stature rigid in comparison to many others.
Beside him a fellow spectator slaps him on the back cheering the match "Hey man your not having any fun, join in the with the cheers!" He attempts to shout over the crowd.
Without a complementary slap on the back in response Lothor merely says "I am having fun, work is fun." Though Lothor does not attempt to raise his voice its doubtful the man even heard him.
"Come on cheer with us! WOOT! Hit him again!" Again the man slaps Lothor on the back this time Lothors only response is to walk away from the man finding another spot to watch the fight.
Once again Lothor stands in the crowd, stands apart from the crowd.

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-24 14:20:31)

The armor of a Knight is a badge of honor, especially to a warrior-bred Mersiv. As it stands, Esre watches the spar with a critical eye, noting fighting styles, moves, feints, what works, what doesn't. After all, what is the purpose of a sparing match if not to improve one's abilities in battle.
And one does not neccissarily need to actually be the one sparing to learn something.
An eyebrow does arch upwards at a few comments, some here, some there, the cheers, the jeers, and perhaps that is a faint curving that comes to the corner of Esre's lips. But then, it might just be some play of the light, an optical illusion.

### **Anazider** (2008-03-24 15:18:16)

Cyrian evades Arik's upward strike at just the last moment, leaving the Firrerreoan's side open to a riposte. But Cyrian's counterattack is too aggressive, causing him to swing over his opponent and overbalance himself.
"Its not a slaggin' hammer! A Knight strikes with skill, and poise, not brute strength alone!"
Sesaren shouts at Cyrian, cupping his hands around his mouth to use them as a megaphone, although the man's brash baritone makes this unnecessary, even with the raucous nature of the crowd.
A junior officer sidles her way through the crowd surrounding the Sarge's dais until she's standing just to the side of the platform. The officer, a blonde young woman, salutes Master Sesaren, handing a datapad up to him before making her way back through the throng and out of the training facility. Sesaren scans the datapad with his good eye before shoving it into his belt, and returning his attention to the fighters.
"Seein' as how I'm growin' tired watchin' you two try to kiss each other, next strike wins! And you nerfkriffers better make it good, or I'll come out there and finish it my damnself!"
((Arik has won the initiative. Cyrian critical missed (rolled a 1), and as such suffers a -2 on his reflex defense until his turn.))

---

### **simplyscribed** (2008-03-24 16:12:36)

*Next strike wins it, huh? My odds are looking better. Okay, let's go for it!*
Cyrian's overbearing attack has left Arik with an opening to exploit that he's unlikely to get again - not now Sarge has verbally boxed the guy's ears for it. The Firrerreo moves to take advantage of it, dodging around his overbalanced opponent and making a short sharp strike with his stave towards the man's side.

---

### **Frost** (2008-03-24 16:42:06)

Cyrian winces at the rebuke he quickly regains his composure and instead of trying to correct the overbalance he rolls into it using its momentum to carry him forward. He tumbles forward and away rolling to his feet taking a defensive stance.
*ooc:Does the bock talent only work with lightsabers or can we use it with these training staves? going full defensive +10 Ref trained in acrobatics. If he does hit and we can use black then UtF +11*

---

### **Anazider** (2008-03-25 00:03:13)

Arik presses his advantage over the unbalanced Cyrian, maneuvering around the man and hoping to end the spar with a quick, deft stroke. Cyrian attempts to turn the stumble into a forward roll, coming to his feet in a defensive posture.
But just as Cyrian regains his feet, Arik brings an overhead chop down upon him, the dark-haired youth bringing his stave up in a cross block. The firrerreoan slides his stave along the cross block, adding pressure to the tip of Cyrian's stave and causing his guard to go high. Arik uses the opening to slash across Cyrian's midsection, the stave clacking loudly and discharging a crackle of blue energy as it connects. Cyrian doubles over, the force of the blow knocking the wind from him while the stave's minimal stun setting causes his knees to weaken.
"Damn fine move pretty boy, damn fine. And that was a good thought Cyrian, but you got out-quicked. Don't let it happen again. Hit the 'freshers!"
Sesaren runs his gaze over the crowd until it lands on Esre, then Kanner. He points to each before hopping down from his platform and heading for his office. With the spectacle completed, the crowd begins to disperse, some only after the discreet (or seemingly so) exchange of credits from one palm to another.

---

### **Frost** (2008-03-25 02:01:42)

Cyrian feels a flash of anger and humiliation course through him but he quickly lets it go. Its better to learn from your mistakes than resent someone being better than you.
"Good shot but I'll get you next time." He says with a chuckle.
He holds his staff up and salutes the victor. He then heads to the fresher to clean up.

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-25 08:39:57)

Lothor stands at atention and gives a slaute as the commanding officer on deck points him out. Walking briskly towards Sesaren Lothor stops in front of him at attention and holds the salute "Sir! Yes Sir?" Lothor`s response is direct and to the point, the imperial Knights voice confident but not above the crowd as the mummers diminish with the end of the bout.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2008-03-25 10:48:55)

'I wasn't expecting to get so lucky *this* time, Arik replies quietly before Cyrian leaves.
He doesn't immediately follow the other man to the refreshers, having spotted a few familiar faces. Shutting down the energy stave the Firrerreo lets it clatter to the floor as he moves into the crowd, acknowledging the congratulations he receives with a smile and the occasional pat on his sweaty back with a grimace.
'Captain Gains, Buula, Teo. Where are the others?'
'They're just off collecting their winnings.' The Captain replies. Small, wiry, and mousy-haired; Captain Gains is hardly the image of a hero. Yet he has conducted his naval career with honour and skill, winning several awards in the process. Also, as his squad jokes, his small stature make him the perfect fit for a fighter cockpit.
'You didn't bet on the match?' Arik asks in mock surprise.
'We didn't bet on this outcome.' Teo butts in, a grimace on his features.
'Nice to see you again too, Teo.' Arik replies with a resigned chuckle, eyeing his chief rival in the squadron.
'We thought for sure you'd lose.' Buula adds. 'The other guy seemed to have more skill; either that or he'd watched too many action holovids.'
'Between you and me, he does.'
'Have more skill, or watch too many action holovids?' Buula laughs.
'The first. The second, who knows? I barely knew how to hold that thing until today, and the same can't be said for him. I just got lucky.' Arik modestly replies.
'I was sure the legendary Phontemain luck wouldn't extend to groundpounding. I've lost a week's wages thanks to you.' Teo fumes. The blue-skinned Duros is wearing an expression Arik has long since learned to recognise as a glower, now.
'He's been behaving since you left, you know.' Buula comments, eyes twinkling. 'You must be a bad influence.'
'Oh, I am.' Arik admits breezily, smiling at the attractive human - who, he muses, bears a striking resemblance to the holorecords he's seen of Padme Amidala.
'I bet the Captain is glad to be rid of me.'
'I'll be glad to be rid of you right now, Arik.' Gains snipes, nose wrinkled. 'Hit the refresher already!'
'Okay, okay. I'm a ghost. See you around, Captain; Buula. Maybe not you Teo, for the sake of that tic you're developing - it doesn't look healthy. Give my regards to the others.'
Still smiling, Arik turns and works his way through the thankfully now thinning crowd toward the refresher station.

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-25 13:49:23)

As Sesaren's eyes fall on her, the young Knight straightens, as if she hadn't a pole up her back as it is already, her hands clasped behind her. A sharp snap of her head is given, and Esre moves along with Kanner towards the man, snapping a salute in unison, her voice chiming, harmony to Kanner's melody, "Sir! Yes, Sir?"

---

### **Anazider** (2008-03-26 19:30:08)

"At ease, the both of you. This ain't a inspection."
Sesaren throws himself heavily into the chair behind his desk, the miniaturized repulsors in the base of the chair struggling to compensate against the force. Settling his hands evenly on the large desk, the Sarge appraises both knights for a long moment before finally grunting to himself.
"You should be well aware of the Bellerophon's current mission to Carosi XII. Admiral wants a squad of Knights assigned to the missionary group going to do the negotiations."
He pulls the datapad from his belt and slides it across the desk towards the two. Sesaren kicks his feet up onto his desk, regarding Esre and Kanner over steepled fingers.
"You two will be a part of the squad, with Knight-Captain Deisser as the lead. Seein' as how this is a blue milk run, I'll be assignin' a pair of candidates to shadow you too. Be good field experience."
Esre and Kanner will note that the two candidates assigned to their squad are the ones that just finished sparring: Arik Phontemaine and Cyrian Darkstar.
"Pretty boy is yours, Mersiv. That leaves gloomy to you, Kanner. Show'm the ropes, bring everyone back alive, and I may not regret all the time I've wasted in trainin' you. Questions?"

---

### **Frost** (2008-03-26 20:07:44)

Cyrian hits the refresher and cleans the sweat and grime off him. He replays the fight in his mind as he cleans himself up. He analyzes his mistakes and what worked for future study.
By the time he has his uniform on he is in a much better mood.
He heads out and returns to his quarters and checks his data term to see if he has any messages or anything else on his schedule for the day.

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-26 20:20:56)

At Sesaren`s order to stand at ease Lothor finishes his salute but continues his perfect posture stance. As the commanding officer gives his orders Lothor listens intently nodding at the mention of Bellerophon's current mission to Carosi XII. At the end of Sesaren`s orders Lothor salutes again and barks out "Sir! Yes sir! Gloomy will be assigned to myself sir! Everyone comes back alive sir! Knight-Captain Deisser has the lead sir! Missionary group going to do the negotiations, yes sir!" Lothor drops his salute again "Sir if I may sir are we to act as escort for a diplomat or are we heading the negotiations ourselves sir?"

---

### **simplyscribed** (2008-03-26 23:57:13)

Arik hits the refresher and leaves it feeling, well, refreshed. He changes out of the light, loose clothes he'd worn for the sparring match and into his naval uniform. He then spends a moment looking down at the new insignia - the one that tells the Galaxy he's affiliated with the Imperial Knights. Discomfort, accusation, and small measures of amazement and pride; all those can be found in his expression, though no one is around to see it.
'Damn it,' he says at last, 'I should have just let him pound me.'
Unsure what he's meant to be doing with himself now, and whether he's even still on duty, Arik debates returning to his cramped quarters. *No fun or profit to be had in that, though.*
Instead, he strolls back to the training area to get in some practice with blasters.

---

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-27 12:11:27)

At being told to be at ease, Esre shifts to parade rest, her hands behind her back. She listens to Sesaren in silents, then looks over the datapad without reaching for it as he continues. For another few moments, she is silent, internally debating, calculating, before she gives a firm nod in acknowledgement of the orders. Then, she says something, that one might consider a joke, "I will also make certain there will be no little golden children running around several months from now, Sir."
Hey, Sasaren called him pretty boy. That just means that there are other subtle dangers to watch out from the boy, right? She wouldn't be making a joke in front of a superior officer! Nope! Esre is too professional about that.
And she'll keep the groans about babysitting duty internal for now.

---

### **Anazider** (2008-03-27 15:05:53)

"Son, unless you're talkin' about negotiatin' that plasteel rod out of your aft deck, I don't expect you to be doin' much by way of diplomacy. Make sure things run smoothly, and all the delegates get back in one piece. That is it."
Sesaren shakes his head before affixing his good eye on Esre.
"And I didn't say I expected any funny business, did I *Knight*," The Sarge emphasizes the word, as if its import should deride any such frivolous thoughts, "Mersiv? What I do expect is for you to conduct yourselves in a manner befittin' your station, not like a gaggle of Kowakian monkey-lizards in heat."
Lacing his hands behind his head, Sesaren looks from Esre to Kanner and back, a wolfish grin splitting his broad face.
"Although the release might do the both of you some good. We exit hyperspace at 0800 hours tomorrow, and your shuttle leaves shortly after. Brief Darkstar and Phontemaine, get to know'm a bit. Dismissed!"
Sesaren turns away from the two, turning his attention to one of the very many reports littering his desk.

---

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-27 15:24:22)

Esre keeps her gaze level on the Sergeant, her eyes only blinking once out of reflex. There is a faint curious perse that tries to form on her lips, but Esre manages to hold it into check. "Yes, Sir. Perhaps I will keep that in mind when I have some R&R time available." ... And actually take it.
A sharp snap of a salute is taken, and Esre makes certain it is in time with Lothor's, and she will turn and leave Saresan's office with the other Knight. Once several steps away, Esre finally speaks. "I will fetch Phontemaine, you Darkstar, then we will meet in the commisary for drinks. Acceptable?" she asks the man next to her, then gives a firm nod, mostly to herself, moving to take quick, firm strides towards the trainee's barracks.

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-28 17:33:53)

A little unsure of how to take the commanders statement Lothor merely Salutes again and barks out "Sir! Yes Sir!" Lothor pauses a moment waiting to be dismissed. When the commander does not give the formal dismissal Lothor interprets the commands turned attention as a sign of a dismissal and exits the room. Heading for the his personal quarters it will not take long to pack for 0800, on the way Lothor does take a moment to consider part of his order to get to know Darkstar. Not sure how to go about this Lothor decides to just call him up and see what he is doing.
Finding a nearby work station Lothor logs in and brings up a file on Darkstar. Tapping his com Lothor makes a general hail "Cyrian Darkstar report to the mess hall for deployment orders Vox out."

---

### **Frost** (2008-03-28 17:44:04)

Cyrian is studying for his classes when over the intercomm.
"Cyrian Darkstar report to the mess hall. Vox out."
Cyrian wonders what he messed up this time or maybe the Sarge gave him mess duty for losing the match. Who knows, He gets himself squared away and heads to the mess hall double time. He finds Vox and runs up to him and stops at the posistion of attention.
"Sir Cadet Darkstar reporting as ordered Sir."

---

### **Anazider** (2008-03-28 20:53:06)

Esre doesn't find Arik in his bunk, but a couple of inquiries directs her to the firing range. There she finds an assortment of the ship's personnel training their blaster skills. Some are in the middle of instruction, while others are shooting at their leisure. After a quick glance through the crowd, Esre spies the Firrerreoan chatting with a few members of his former squadron, one the young blonde woman that had congratulated him after the sparring match.
********
Cyrian marches through through the mess hall, which is sparsely filled this late in operational hours. Some members are catching a late meal after finishing their shift, while others are grabbing a bite just before their shift begins.
Kanner sits at a table all to himself. There are other populated tables around the junior knight, some even with other imperial knights, but oddly, or perhaps not that oddly, Kanner has decided to sit by himself.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2008-03-28 21:25:25)

Arik chats animatedly to his friends from Maw Squadron, his decision to get in some firing practice forgotten now that he has something more entertaining to occupy his time with. The new girl Buula is with Grey and Endrice, two of his closer friends in the squadron.
'I can't believe you bet on my winning, though.' He says to Grey.
The Bothan smirks and taps his snout which, along with the rest of him, is the colour from which his nickname is derived.
'We won, didn't we?' He responds dismissively.
The orange-skinned Twi'lek Endrice nods her head in agreement, tips of her lekku bobbing in time.
'We bet on your legendary luck, Slayer. It was a sure thing.'
'You guys are going to jinx me, talking like that.' Arik notes ruefully, giving Buula an apologetic smile. 'Sorry, but they seem to like building up my legend. I think they're hoping it will speed up the inevitable fall.'

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-30 17:39:29)

As Cyrian enters the mess hall Lothor stands and motions for the man to approach. Lothor gives a salute and states "At ease lieutenant Darkstar, you may be seated." Lothor sits after the man gets comfortable. For a moment Lothor studies a few data pads then piles them neatly to the side.
"Lieutenant Darkstar you have been assigned to aid my squad in an upcoming mission. You will be reporting directly to me until further notice." Lothor pauses to takes a drink and continues." I have read into your file .... your past is odd by any standard. I will expect nothing short of success on any mission, do you see any reason I should have you replaced? " Lothor taps his fingers on the table and awaits a response.

---

### **Frost** (2008-03-30 20:22:46)

Darkstar contemplates the question and its phrasing for a few moments before answering.
"No Sir there is no reason to have me replaced. I will do everything in my power or lay down my life to ensure the mission is successful. If it alright with you sir may I ask what our mission is?"
Cyrian relies on his training in to keep his nervousness from showing. He thinks of all the bad luck people have had on other missions he went on but at least missions were successful. Junior Knight Danju's cybernetic arm works better than his old one anyway.

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-31 18:03:30)

Lothor allows for a brief smile at LT Darkstar`s answer before regaining his composure. "Excellent LT Darkstar, the empire may still have a place for you yet. We have orders to report directly to Knight-Captain Deisser." Lothor takes another drink "You of course will report directly to me. Our first mission will take us to Carosi XII. As you should be aware The Bellerophon has been assigned to the missionary group and initiate the negotiations on Carosi XII."
Lothor gives Cyrian a moment to reflect on his words before continuing "As part of Knight-Captain Deisser squad it is our duty to ensure the success of Knight-Captain Deisser`s mission." Lothor passes Cyrian a data pad with a copy of the information handed to Esre and Lothor. "This is the mission profile study it then report to the hanger bay at 0800." Lothor stands and salutes LT Darkstar "Dismissed!"

---

### **Frost** (2008-03-31 18:15:43)

*just an FYI the junior officer always salutes first as a sign of respect to the senior officer.*
Darkstar jumps to his feet and salutes his senior officer.
"Yes Sir."
He then heads back to his quarters. He sets a wake up alarm at 0600. He then packs his gear and stages it by the door. Once thats done he studies the mission briefing repeatedly try to commit the important information to memory. Eventually he falls asleep at his desk. He wakes up a few hours later with the datapad stuck to his cheek. He pulls it off and climbs into his rack for the night.

### **Anazider** (2008-04-01 12:46:05)

**Esre:** A few quiet inqueries were made, once Esre had assertained that Phontemaine was not in his quarters. A few false leads, and even more frowns from Esre, has the young female Knight making her way to the blaster range. She's still in her armor, but then, some think she lives in it. Her gaze sweeps across the room as she can see it, and she senses - extending her feelings through the force - where she cannot. Her prey, so to speak, the Pilot turned trainee, that is obviously to be a poster child for the Victory without War - The Golden Boy. Useful distraction, that golden skin.
**Arik:** Said "Golden Boy" is currently having a conversation with some friends, all of whom are in naval uniforms like his own.
**Esre:** Moving slowly towards the group, Esre looks them over. Yes, it would figure the non-humans would congregate together. Only natural given the tendancy of the Empire to be Human-centric. (To put it mildly). A nod is given as Esre approaches, then clasps her hands behind her back. For now she waits, seeing who acknowledges her first and how so.
**Arik:** The orange Twi'lek is ideally positioned to notice her first, but Arik quickly sees her focusing her attention beyond him and turns to see why. Upon sighting Esre he reaches down to the Imperial Knight insignia on his naval uniform, running a hand over the jacket to straighten it.
'Err, hi!'
He looks at Esre, searching for her own rank so he can work out how to address her.
**Esre:** With a bow of her head, the noblewoman in Knight's armor greets Arik. "Forgive the intrusion, but I'm afraid I have good news and bad news. The good news, you have an assignment. The bad news, 0800 tomorrow morning you are to report and be ready for it, Phontemaine," she says in her brusque military manner. Then she nods to the others.
"I have been rude again, have I not?" she muses. "I am Esre Mersiv, Knight of the Empire," she notes, before looking back to Arik. "And you, Phontemaine, are to be under my supervision as we escourt the Ambassador to the planet we now orbit."
**Arik:** 'Right, thank you...' He finally registers her rank insignia. 'Captain. I'm sure it will be a pleaure working with you and benefitting from your experience.'
**Esre:** For not the first time Esre thought: I wish Nadia were here. She was always so much better with being social.
Clearing her throat, Esre shifts faintly as she looks around at the former pilot and his friends.
"I have been ordered to get to know you, Lieutenant." There is a faint pause, and the woman even lets out, "And not by interrogating you."
Again the woman's eyes dance around the area, always watching, always observing, finally she turns to look at the Twi'lek.
"May I join you and your friends?" And Esre hopes to the Force that this Twi'lek can pick up in some womanly fashion she has yet to discover, Esre's honest attempts for what they are. There are obvious disadvantages for being raised in a militarily minded family. Social graces or lack there of, is one of them.
**Endrice:** The Twi'lek smiles in a friendly fashion. 'Don't mind us, we can see Arik any time. We should let you two get on with it, don't you think?'
**Arik:** Arik looks around at her. 'Uh, well, I guess so.'
**Grey:** The grey-furred Bothan smirks. 'You'll thank us for letting you have some "quality time" later.'
**Buula:**The blonde laughs, says 'It was nice to meet you Esre, we'll stay and chat next time when you've gotten to know as much about Arik as you can stand.'
**Arik:** And then with farewells, the three take their leave. Arik glares after them.
'Some friends.' He grumbles.
**Esre:** An eyebrow slowly rises, and Esre's lips just barely start to turn upwards. The blonde is reminecent of her own friends.
"Or you can console him for the time that he was forced to waste with me and call "quality time"," she notes with nods to those departing. Then Esre looks back to Arik.
"I am unaccustomed to social situations and the social dynamic," she says, slowly settling into a seat.
"My family focuses on the military and the military alone. They were taking pity on me," she notes. "By leaving, I do not have to try to flounder my way through your groups dynamic in order to ... well ... feel you out."
**Arik:** He smirks in response to this.
'It's not hard, actually. We're all Ace pilots. It's all ego, one-up-manship, light-hearted mockery, and practical jokes.'
The "golden-boy" settles in a chair of his own. 'So, is this formal or informal, Captain? Am I using your rank, for a tart?'
**Esre:** "Ahhhh," notes Esre.
"I remember those from academy training," she says with a faint arch of an eyebrow upwards.
"I was on the recieving end, more than I ever gave them. I tended to get even in other ways." Esre watches Arik for a moment, before shaking her head.
"Let's try informal. Esre will do," she states, glancing around, before leaning forward, "And if you ever use Lady, I'll punch a hole in the outer hull and let you squeeze through slowly."
That was meant as a joke, with a very dry dry sense of humor. Unfortunately, this probably wasn't the best of circumstances to let said humor show.
**Arik:** 'I'd like to see anyone punch a hole in the hull.' Arik replies. 'Though not getting sucked through before I did would be an accomplishment worth seeing, too.'
'But aside from me seriously considering calling you the "L" word, how much do you know about me? I assume you have a file.'
**Esre:** "I have, and I have not reviewed it yet," admits Esre.
"I came here directly from Sergeant Sesaren's office. I decided not to bias myself with your file, when trying to get to know you," offers Esre, managing just a faint rolling of her shoulders in the red armor she wears. "Are you going to tell me what I'll find in it, and what is what you want us to see and what is real?"
**Arik:** 'Oh, if it's the same file Commander Harkun has, it has more in it about me than I'm comfortable with, so it's pretty much all for real.' Arik responds with a grimace.
'About the only thing not on the file... well, it's not important. Uh, I'm not sure what you need to know about me. I was born and bred on Bastion. I'm a pilot, an Ace even, and I'm more comfortable in a fighter's cockpit than I'll ever be in a suit of that armour. I've gone through all the standard military training, but I'm not really a fighter. If you saw the duel today you have to know I got lucky. What else is there?'
**Esre:** The woman sitting there considers for a moment, watching Arik.
"Why did you join the military in the first place?" she asks in a steady and even tone. There is something that glints in the woman's gaze as she studies the Firrerreo and listens to his answers. "And why are you so uncomfortable with the thought of being a Knight? Is it the attention? The parting of old ways? The fact we wear this red armor that stands out more than a Hutt's Casino sign?"
**Arik:** 'All three. I like being recognised and praised, but I don't need to be THAT high profile. I don't think I'm going to get to fly enough, particularly not in a fighter where I like to be... and I'll miss Maw Squadron. And yes, that armour is hideous. It's also that it's a lot of presure. Pressure that I didn't put on myself, like it has been in the past.'
'As for why I joined... I was good pilot, and a loyal citizen of the Empire. I knew I had the skills to help protect people, so I put them to the correct use. And yes, I've been told already that I'll be doing the same as a Knight, but it's... just not where I imagined I'd be.'
**Esre:** "The Force has a way of guiding us where we least expected to be," notes Esre.
"I am the first Knight in my family, the first to be even remotely sensative enough to the will of the Force, actually. My father had my Imperial Navy uniforms all picked out and on order for my rise through the ranks before I was old enough to walk." That said, Esre manages a bit more of a smile. "Besides, frankly, you would have gotten all this attention anyway. You make a wonderful posterboy."
**Arik:** Arik raises a brow.
'I can't decide whether that was a racist remark or an attempt at flattery.' He says, then smiles and chuckles to show he hasn't really taken offense. 'Still, I hope you don't judge me by my appearance. It's the one thing about myself I have little control over, after all, so ultimately it means nothing.'
**Esre:** "It makes a good distraction," notes Esre, thinking tactically again.
"You should use it to your advantage in situations which call for it," she continues. "And it was an attempt at a joke, actually. Pretty Boy and Golden Boy are bandied about often in relation to you. It just happens to fit in well with the new initiative."
**Arik:** 'By Sesaren I bet,' Arik groans. 'How would he like it if I referred to him constanty as "Bitter Old Man"?'
**Esre:** "You remember that threat I gave earlier? Magnify the pain by twenty, and make the whole a pin-prick," suggests Esre in response. "You get used to people like that, and even learn to appriciate their ... view. They're gruff and surly because they think that is what you need most to face the ... well ... poodoo that is the REAL galaxy out there. It's a fine mess that isn't going to be fixed overnight, asmuch as we would all like."
**Arik:** 'I know about poodoo, Esre. I'm a Firrerreo.' Arik comments with a shrug. 'So, tell me more about you, then. Navy family brat gone wrong, I think we'd got to.'
**Esre:** "Navy, Army, wherever we're needed at the time. But a little girl just doesn't look as cute in Stormtrooper armor as a navy uniform," notes Esre with a shrug.
"My father is an Admiral. My mother's father was well ranked in the Army," she says. "And my aunt is in the Intelligence Division. Amoung the nobility, Mersiv IS the military," is offered.
**Arik:** 'Nice pedigree.' He replies. 'I can't imagine you tarnishing the family name, though, this seems like another step in the right direction for its rep. Your parents mut be proud.'
**Esre:** "I believe my parents are proud," notes Esre with a faintly upraised eyebrow.
"However, it is one of those nebulous things called emotion which are not shown in my family," she states with what could be considered humor, it's just very very dry. "And what of your family?"
**Arik:** 'Dad's a trader by, well, trade. That's how I learned to fly.' Arik smiles at this, clearly remembering one of his happier moments out there, in charge of a metal box floating in the deep dark of space. 'Mom is an undersecretary for Bastion's health minister.'
'Pretty much it... I know they are proud of me. Mom sends me messages telling me so practically every day.'
**Esre:** "Both decent professions. And let me guess, you're afraid that if you become a Knight, you won't be able to fly anymore, right?" asks Esre as she leans back just a touch, perhaps she's actually relaxing. "Knights have ranks in both the Navy and the Army, you know. You'll likely end up assigned to leading a squad of fighters yourself, in the end. If your true skill is piloting, why would the Imperial Knights take that away from you?"
**Arik:** 'Because you Knights have better things to do than fly. It's all about protecting the Emperor, his family, and other officials. You're more like bodyguards than anything. Bodyguards don't find many chances to fly.'
'Not in a fighter at least.' He corrects himself.
**Esre:** "So you think," notes Esre. "If there is a battle raging outside a ship one of the Imperial Family is on, are we Knights going to just sit and wait inside? Are we not on an escort mission right now? The shuttle surely has escort fighters flying with it. Part of protecting the Emperor, the Imperial family and the Empire is being there in any capability, as we are needed."
**Arik:** 'I have a strong suspicion,' Ark retorts, 'that I'm going to be assigned to pilot the shuttle, not take part in the escort. If it were the latter they'd have informed me by now so I'd know to do checks on my fighter before mission start.'
He leans back himself, putting his hands behind his head.
'Which is all very well. I can fly a shuttle as well as anyone, maybe better than most. I can keep the people in it alive and maybe push the shuttle past its limits. But I'd still do a better job if I were part of the escort. If the enemy is threatening the shuttle itself, the escort have already failed.'
**Esre:** "They put the piloting of the shuttle into your hands," notes Esre calmly.
"Do you not think that shows a confidence in your abilities and an obvious use of your skills. After all, if there is trouble, and the shuttle must be piloted through a hostile environment...." says the woman with the faintest wave of her hand. "The most important part and the most dangerous part of flying on this mission, is flying a shuttle that has no weapons to return fire. I would think of that as a challenge, myself."
**Arik:** 'Ah, you buy into the "Ace's ego" stories too easily.' Arik says with a wave of his hand. 'I'm like any soldier. A blue milk run is more satisfactory than a challenge at the end of the day, because lives are on the line.'
**Esre:** "Then I don't see what your worries are," notes Esre as she slowly rises, looking down at Arik for a moment, before she allows the barest hint of a smile on her features.
"They'll put you to good use, fighting, flying, and even running errands. You won't be giving up the cockpit, trust me," she notes.
**Arik:** 'I hope you're right.' Arik notes. 'Because I'm never going to be the best at duelling, or anything else a Knight is supposed to be capable of. I'd hate to be the poor idiot who assigns me to the Emperor as a guardian. I won't be alive to suffer the consequences for the error in judgement.'
**Esre:** "There is always someone better than you out there at something," notes Esre calmly. "It is a simple fact. You may not meet them today, you may not meet them at all. But there is always someone. What does it matter if I'm better at dueling than you. You're probably better at social aspects, you seem rather charismatic to me. And you'll only get better if you put your mind to it and practice.
"And as I recall, the Emperor hand-picks his own personal escorts," notes Esre, that faint smile pulling at her lips again in the woman's dry humor.
**Arik:** 'So I just danced pretty close to the "treason" line, did I?' Arik replies sorrowfully. 'Good start to my illustrious Knightly career.'
He pauses, and grins at her.
'So you don't think you're charismatic, Esre?' He asks in a mischievous tone.
**Esre:** "I think I was born and raised to be a soldier, I was not raised to be eloquent or good with words," notes the woman before she nods to Arik.
"I won't tell the Emperor that you called him a poor fool," she notes, again with that dry humor.
**Arik:** 'Ah, but you know you could become charismatic. Someone once told me that you'll only get better if you put your mind to it and practice.'
Arik winks, then puts on a serious expression.
'Besides, you've got the tools you need. You're a smart woman, and comely too. You've just got to learn how to put the two together.'
**Esre:** "All in good time, Arik, all in good time," muses Esre, before giving a nod. "I have a few things I need to do before getting the rest I need for our mission. I will see you in the hangar at 0800. Make sure your uniform is nice and crisp and clean."
**Arik:** 'I always do. Gotta behave in a way that'll make mom proud, after all.'
Arik stands, and salutes. 'Knight-Lieutenant,' he acknowledges.
**Esre:** Esre gives a quick salute, "Lieutenant Phontemain" she offers in response with a short, snap of a salute.
"Don't keep your friends waiting," she offers over her shoulder as she turns and leaves the blaster practice range.
**Arik:** Arik watches her go with an expression half-frown, half-smile. As she leaves the room he lets out a little sigh and shakes his head in amusement. Then he doesn't keep his friends waiting.

It is just before 0800, and the hangar is a buzz of structured activity. Refueling and power lines criss-cross the bay floor, while technicians and mechanics go about the routine maintenance necessary to keep the star destroyer, and its fighter squadrons, at peak performance.
Captain Deisser stands just before a shuttle, talking with a trio dressed all in white. From their adornments and the way that they carry themselves in conversation with the Imperial Knight, it is easy to see that this is the diplomatic retinue meant to negotiate with the Carosites. Currently, the envoys stand with their backs facing the hangar entrance, while Captain Deisser stands looking outward, scanning the faces of all those that pass by.
Deisser is a tall man with curly, raven-black hair, and dark eyes that seem to sort and analyze everything they come across. Considered by many to be one of the most handsome men onboard the Bellerophon, Captain Deisser has never been associated with any romances, onboard or otherwise. But there are no rumors as to the captain's personal life, as all onboard the star destroyer know that Deisser's first love is to his Empire. Even still, he carries himself with an easy grace and good nature that makes him instantly likable, and trustworthy.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2008-04-01 16:52:54)

Doubtless if more of the crew had known that Captain Deisser and Lieutenant Phontemain the so-called "Golden Boy" would be appearing at the same place at oh-eight-hundred this morning, the hangar would be even busier than usual.
As it is, when Arik arrives in the hangar he receives only a couple of longing looks, which for once he is blissfully unaware of. All his thoughts are on the upcoming mission - his first mission as an Imperial Knight. Torn between his desire to perform well and his fear that if he does so he might never fly a fighter again, the Firrerreo is troubled. And he's not a good enough actor to hide the fact, either.
He takes his time walking over to Captain Deisser and the diplomats, therefore. He is slightly early, so has time to spare, and he needs to get his mind fully on the mission and force a smile onto his features. He hopes that his discomfort will be put down to nerves.
'Lieutenant Phontemain reporting for duty, Captain.' He says, arriving by Deisser and snapping off a smart salute.

### **Frost** (2008-04-02 11:35:14)

Cyrian wakes up in a sweat. Man that dream was intense but it was already fading away. He got in the refresher and cleaned himself up. He then pressed his uniform and checked it over picking off any loose threads or lint. He got dressed as if he was preparing for a uniform inspection. With his boots polished to a mirror finish, lightsaber hung on his belt he was ready.
He makes his way to the Hanger and sees he isn't the first one here, good he thinks to himself.
He walks over and offers a salute to his superiors.
"Lt. Darkstar reporting for duty, Sir."
He casts a side glance at Arik.

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-02 11:56:15)

Lothor having already been in the hanger walks out from behind the ship. Giving a salute to a few mechanics he was addressing Lothor approaches Captain Deisser stands at attention and gives a salute "Sir Lt Kanner Lothor Vox reporting for duty Sir!."
Lothor makes no attempt to address the diplomats except to salute them. In full Imperial armor saber in clear view Lothor actually smiles. He was born for this; he was born for the empire.
AS the others come in and salute Captain Deisser Lothor stands at attention awaiting orders.

---

### **chibiamy** (2008-04-02 16:13:39)

Exactly on time, not a moment too soon, not a moment too late, Esre Mersiv walks into the hanger bay and salutes Knight Captain Dressier. "Lieutenant Esre Mersiv reporting for duty, Sir!" she says to the man with a sharp salute and a snap to attention. Her eyes do manage to take in the ambassadorial entourage, since she had just 'happened' to position herself facing them directly. And despite the woman's stoic nature, and typically calm and unemotional facade, an eyebrow almost twitches upwards, and one could almost swear that one corner of her lips slips upwards.

---

### **Anazider** (2008-04-03 21:31:41)

Captain Deisser smiles as the first member of the squad reports in. He indicates each as he provides an introduction.
"Knight-candidates Phontemain and Darkstar will be accompanying us as part of their training. Knights Mersiv and Vox will be tasked with safeguarding your attendants, while I am responsible for your safety, ambassador, and overall security detail."
The three diplomats turn to greet the small group, although one turns more quickly than the others. The one, Nadia Ylarn, smiles brightly at Esre. She shares a look with the young knight that indicates they will speak in depth later, which elicits a bemused grin from Astur Vedek.
"Certainly a fine looking group, Captain Deisser. I am sure we shall come to no harm while in your more than capable hands." Ambassador Vedek says to Captain Deisser with a nod, the captain bowing in return.
"All that is left is for our fighter escort to show. Maw squadron has been gracious enough to - ah, I think I see them." Captain Deisser looks over Esre and Arik's heads, nodding to the four that approach.
The four stride toward the shuttle, stopping just before with a salute. Arik can identify them as members of his old flight: Grey the bothan, Endrice the Twi'lek, and Buula who has a particularly attractive smile for Arik. At their head is a Duros wearing a perpetually sour frown, one which only grows deeper as he eyes the Firrereoan and those assembled around him.

---

### **chibiamy** (2008-04-03 22:37:39)

Something surprising happens as Nadia Ylaren turns and flashes a smile at Knight Mersiv - Esre quickly quirks her lips upwards in a smile as well. Then she turns after 'the look' and her attention is on the Ambassador himself as she bows. "Ambassador Vedek," she offers softly, before straightening to attention again.
At the announcement of Maw squadron being the escort, Esre's eyes dance towards Arik, watching his reaction as well. That is likely a blow to the ace pilot, but something akin to amusement allows the briefest of hints to play across the young Knight's expression at the smile which Buula gives to the Firrerreon(OR HOWEVER THAT IS SPELLED!!!!!!). This is going to be an interesting trip.
Always exciting, a life in service to the Empire.

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-04 06:10:10)

Standing at attention listening to each of his new commanders words Lothor is quite during the briefing. The idea of having Maw squadron escort us on our first mission makes it all feel more real. These are the kind of missions we trained for this is how all the greats started out. Giving a curious look when the diplomat stares at Esre Lothor dismisses it and regains focus on the briefing.

---

### **Frost** (2008-04-04 10:52:11)

Cyrian watches the interactions with interest. Being the low man on the pole he keeps his mouth shut and his eyes and ears open. He looks to the two commanding knights for instructions.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2008-04-04 12:33:15)

If Esre was expecting the appearance of members from his old squadron to be a problem for Arik, then his actual reaction is a surprising one. The facade of his worried smile cracks, only to reveal a very real smile underneath.
'We have nothing to worry about if Maw Squadron is on escort duty', he comments with a happy look towards his friends and rival. 'With your permission, Captain Deisser, am I correct in assuming I will be piloting the shuttle? If so I would like to have a quick discussion with them. I've flown escort duty with Maw Squadron before, but only as part of the escort.'

---

### **Anazider** (2008-04-05 19:48:44)

Captain Deisser regards Arik with an upturned eyebrow, an amused twinkle in his eye.
"It would seem Candidate Phontemain is developing precognition along with the rest of his abilities in the force. Permission granted. Everyone else, let us board the shuttle and prepare for departure."
The captain nods to his squad and the trio of diplomats before proceeding up the boarding ramp. Ambassador Vedek and his two attendants soon follow, leaving the squad of imperial knights and the escort flight from Maw Squadron.

---

### **Frost** (2008-04-07 10:33:50)

Darkstar walks over to Vox.
"Sir shall we get ourselves squared away on board? Do you know where we are bunking down for this mission?"
Darkstar seems a little nervous no really sure what he is supposed to be doing with himself.

---

### **chibiamy** (2008-04-07 11:09:04)

Her face impassive as is typical, but Esre is very much relieved. A bow of her head to Captain Dressier, and Esre takes one last glance around before turning to the ambassadorial contingent, "After you, please," she notes, motioning forward with her hand in a formal manner.
Really, it's just happenstance that should there be a seat next to Nadia that Esre takes it. Honest! Happenstance!

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-07 14:05:34)

At Captain Deisser`s command Lothor salutes "Sir! Yes Sir!" then looks over to Darkstar as if to answer both at once. Stepping onto the loading ramp Lothor walks inside does a quick sweep of the shuttle. Its really unnecessary but even routine is duty bound. Once Lothor is satisfied the shuttle is all clear Lothor steps back onto the loading ramp, "All clear sir!" and salutes Captain Deisser.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2008-04-07 20:47:24)

'So did you guys volunteer for this or what?' Arik asks, turning a smile on the members of Maw squadron as soon as the other Imperial Knights are on board. 'Never mind, it's not important. It's good to have you on the mission. Even you, Teo.'
A wink is delivered to the grouchy Duros.
'Who's flight leader for this escapade?' The firrerreo then asks, looking expectantly between Grey, Endrice, and yes - even Teo.

---

### **Anazider** (2008-04-07 22:02:22)

"That would be me... Although someone *volunteered* us." Grey nods to Arik, showing little emotion with the gesture.
"Captain Gains promised choice of rotation for shore leave on Carosi to the first to show up in his office. It can't be helped if everyone else is so slow." The orange Twi'lek grins toothily at Arik and his squad mates, eliciting a stifled chuckle from Buula, a roll of the eyes from Grey, and an even deeper scowl from Teo.
"Really, the only one to protest was Teo..." Endrice says a wink to the the grumpy Duros. Teo rises to the bait, as is often the case, causing even more amusement for the others.
"We all know my talents are being wasted on escort duty for a blue milk truck!"
******
"Knight Vox, what do you think you are doing?" Captain Deisser folds his arms across his chest as he watches the junior knight go about his inspection, wearing an expression of strained humor.
"Attempting to insult the hangar's technicians and bay security, from the looks of it. People tend to become gravely offended when you always double and triple check their work." Astur comments with a wry grin. Behind him Nadia hides a polite chuckle behind her hand, while the other attendant looks on with pompous distaste.
"If that is the case, he will find his goal soon accomplished at this rate. We will have to have a *talk* after this mission, Kanner."
Captain Deisser strides toward the flight cabin, leaving Esre, Kanner, and Cyrian with Missionary Vedek and his entourage.
Row after row of bucket seats mark the shuttle as a military transport, forgoing the luxury and grace of a statesman's courier in favor of pure functionality. Just past the passenger area is a wide cargo deck generally reserved for combat vehicles. Sitting in the middle of the space, and not taking up nearly as much room, is a bundle nearly a meter in height and obscured by an arched tarp; the Empire's gift to the Carosites.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2008-04-07 22:22:22)

'Excellent!' Arik exclaims with a grin, clasping hands with the Bothan. 'with my old flight up among the stars with me and my wingman in charge, what can go wrong?'
He chuckles then.
'Just like Endrice to volunteer Maw Squadron for something the rookies could have handled when a vacation is involved. And just like Teo to complain about an easy run.'
His lips twitch as he baits Teo, but he doesn't give the Duros time to respond.
'Okay Maw Squadron, let's get this mission started. Grey, I'll take my cues from you. Grey, Endrice, Buula, Teo... may the Force be with you.'
With a final smile that makes him seem every bit the poster boy Esre suggested, Arik salutes - first, acknowledging both what he sees as their more important role in the space-born portion of the mission and his respect for them as fellow pilots - then turns smartly on his heel and walks up the ramp into the shuttle.
Once within he heads straight for the cockpit to familiarise himself with the controls. It's been a little while since he's flown a shuttle after all, it can't hurt to have a little refresher.

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-08 06:27:50)

Lothor frowns when Captain Deisser scolds him. About to speak up with a come back like (Sir! My job sir! No insult intended sir!) his mouth still open Lothor decides to keep that to himself. Instead Lothor stands at attention holding a salute to Captain Deisser "Sir! Yes sir!" Lothor watches as the diplomats and then his troop enter the shuttle before entering himself.

---

### **Frost** (2008-04-08 10:38:58)

Cyrian watches the senior officer rebuke Knight Vox. He doesn't say a word and just goes and sits down and straps in. He closes his eyes and relaxes for a few minutes then opens them feeling a little calmer. He seems to be the only person here who doesn't reallt know anyone so he just keeps to himself.

---

### **Anazider** (2008-04-11 18:57:30)

The four pilots from Maw squadron salute in unison, although with varying degrees of seriousness. They each quickly saunter to their Predator-class Starfighters and hop in with a practiced grace, the starfighters quickly coming to life as the cockpit canopy closes.
Arik boards the shuttle and sees Esre, Cyrian, and Kanner, as well as the diplomats, comfortably appointed into a row of bucket seats. Upon entering the flight cabin, he finds Captain Deisser situated at one of the auxiliary stations. The captain smiles at the Firrerreoan, holding a gauntleted hand aloft in the direction of the pilot's seat.
"All yours, Candidate Phontemain. Commander Harkun seems rather impressed with your abilities - I hope you do not disappoint." Deisser nods to Arik, the slight twirk of his lips belying the inherent threat of his statement.
"Shuttle Trireme One, you are cleared for departure."
The lead Predator of Maw flight activates its repulsors and taxis out of the hangar, followed by his wingman until the entire flight is hovering just outside of the port in an escort formation, awaiting the shuttle to assume the center position.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2008-04-11 19:24:02)

'I may be a fighter Ace, but I was *raised* in and around a shuttle, sir.' Arik replies mildly, expressing his utmost confidence that whatever the Galaxy throws at him he can handle - as well as any being could be expected to handle it, at least.
While flight clearance is granted and Maw Squadron move out into formation, the Firrerreo takes his time warming up the systems, so that as soon as the fourth fighter is in place he is lifting the shuttle up on its repulsors, bringing it around at a precise angle to face the hangar entrance and a point directly between the four predators. Slowly and smoothly he taxis *Trireme One* out to join the starfighters in the centre of their escort formation.
Arik Phontemain, born pilot, simply smiles. Who cares if Captain Deisser is in the cabin with him. Who could care if it were the force-loving Emperor Fel himself? There's no pressure. This is easy, this is natural. This is where he's meant to be.

---

### **chibiamy** (2008-04-11 19:48:35)

Esre takes several moments to settle into her seat, her eyes shifting next to the woman in white settled next to her. Adjusting the armor once more, Esre waits until the shuttle has left the hanger bay to even give the smallest hint of a smile to Nadia. "You look well. This sort of work where you _talk_ at people rather than hit them with glowing light-sticks seems to be agreeing with you," the noble woman offers with a very understated tease, in a voice very near a whisper.

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-12 08:05:49)

Lothor returns the salute from Maw squadron before entering the shuttle. Inside Lothor quietly takes a seat buckles himself in and attempts to avoid eye contact with Captain Deisser not looking forward to another scolding or his "talk" with the captain after the mission. Lothor does scan on one of the auxiliary stations. Trying to look busy Lothor runs a systems check even though he already knows it will check out.

---

### **Frost** (2008-04-14 03:22:52)

Cyrian gets up once the ship has taken off. He has become bored and restless so he has decided to explore the transport a little. He familiarizes himself with areas of the ship. He will check out the cockpit, any weapons stations, the galley ect.

---

### **Anazider** (2008-04-16 21:06:57)

Arik fluidly guides the shuttle into formation and the escort group makes its way to Carosi XII, the four Predator-class starfighters flying around the Trireme with a drilled precision.
The flight takes the better part of fifteen minutes, with only five minutes being actual flight time, the rest being taken with customs checkpoints, and complaints of the Empire's not following proper docking clearance protocols
"Welcome to Carosi XII, shuttle Trireme. You are cleared to land in docking bay A3-1-9." The voice is obviously automated, with all the simulated warmth an electronic greeting can muster.
******
"I was allowed to join the Mission after completing my initial Knight training. I never was one much for the martial life." Nadia says to Esre with a wry grin. She speaks with in a hush with a look towards Astur Vedek, as if wishing to not disturb him.
"And I have truly found my calling. Master Vedek is such a kind and patient man, I am learning a great deal."
Cyrian finds little by way of a galley and other amenities on the ship, the transport serving strictly as a troop carrier and little more. There rows and rows of bucket seats, sixty in all, with the only item of note within the space being the shrouded diplomatic gift.
A quick glance into the cockpit affords Cyrian a view of the various stations, with Arik in the pilot's seat, and Captain Deisser sitting at an auxiliary station. The Captain looks back at the recruit with a quirked eyebrow of askance.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2008-04-17 03:32:29)

'So what's the cargo?' Arik asks Captain Dessier as he brings the shuttle down through the atmosphere of Carosi XII to docking bay A3-1-9.
He glances back toward the passenger area as he asks about the shrouded object, noticing Cyrian in the doorway. After a nod of acknowledgement the firrerreo turns back to the controls.

---

### **chibiamy** (2008-04-17 18:28:33)

"It warms me to see you doing so well, Nadia," comments Esre as she continues their soft conversation. The young Knight follows the diplomats gaze to Ambassador Vedek, before looking back to her friend. "That is truly good news to hear. You will excel under his teachings," notes Esre before wrinkling her nose, in an odd bit of expression from the woman, "And you won't have any Orion's to deal with doing so."
Esre glances around again, first to the cockpit, then to the other Knight-Cadet and back again. "Knight-Captain Dessier has actually asked me to watch after our pilot friend, in a manner of speaking. Help ease him into the Knight program. I trust in his Wisdom, but admit to doubts on my being able to live up to his assessments," notes Esre with a glance askew to Nadia. "Still, things could be worse," she notes with a hand-waving motion.

Not sure what to do but wait for the shuttle to land Lothor accesses the ships sensors and scans docking bay A3-1-9 for life signs. Just a security precaution Lothor wants to be prepared, even if his commanding officer might not agree. Taking a look around the cockpit Lothor gives a nod to his learner then turns back to finish his scan. "Sir! Would you want me and Cyrian to ensure the docking bays safety before our party exits the shuttle?"

Cyrian watches the two in the cockpit for a few moments before he relizes he is being stared at.
"Sorry Sir just looking around the ship."
He eventually wanders back to the passenger area and retakes his seat waiting to land.

Captain Deisser nods to Cyrian before turning to Arik to answer his question.
"The Emperor hopes to sway Carosi opinion by offering a rare- "
"Shuttle Trireme, why have you engaged in unauthorized sensor activity? Please report!"
The captain is cutoff in mid explanation as the warning blares over the ship's comm system. A humanoid voice has replaced the automated one from before, and it is filled with a quaver of surprised urgency. Deisser blinks at Arik and then looks over to the sensor station, his brow creasing in a frown as he eyes Kanner, the frown growing darker by the moment.
"Knight Vox, what is the meaning of this?! Cease what you are doing and return to your seat immediately!" Deisser barks in a command tone while gesturing for Arik to reply to the comm message.

"Yes, miss Ylarn has a very high opinion of master Phontemain and our esteemed captain." Astur Vedek says gently. He turns slowly to smile at the two women, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. Nadia begins to blush considerably, looking away in an attempt to hide a shy smile.
"Come, settle in lad. Pacing doesn't make the boat any quicker." The missionary gestures to Cyrian then to one of the seats near his male attendant.

'Apologies, Carosi control,' Arik responds, 'we had a minor mechanical malfunction. It's just me up here with a diplomatic retinue and the problem could have been serious, so I asked one of them to make an internal sensor sweep while I had my hands full bringing the shuttle down. Obviously they're no pro with the sensors and accidentally set off an external scan.'
He sighs, that of a long-suffering working man forced to deal regularly with the technical ineptitudes of the so-called high and mighty.
'There was no ill intent behind the action,' he adds, 'and I'll keep everyone else away from the controls from now.'

Lothor pushes away from the station "Sir! Yes sir." Then sinks his head down a little this is not going well for me. Lothor waits for orders while the shuttle goes through its docking procedure. One final check on all his gear will make Lothor look busy and pass the time until the ship is docked.

Esre pauses in her very soft conversation with Nadia to peer at the head Ambassador as he makes a comment. An eyebrow starts to rise at the man's comment, then Esre turns to Nadia and says, quite flatly so one might think it -not- a tease, "It must be the skin, and how it plays off the Knight armor." A quick look back to Astur Vedek, and Esre gives a very faint bow of her head.
However, there are words said up ahead, and the woman considers faintly a moment. Her gaze flicks to Nadia once more, then Esre is pushing herself out of her seat and moves over towards Lothor. "My eyes do not often pick out what they need to, you'll need to be the perceptive one, I think. You'll be ready for that, I assume," she notes, leaning against the bulkhead as she waits for the shuttle to land. Well, this is putting Nadia's old Diplomacy lessons to the test, certainly. If the Force is with Esre, she can help distract the man from his mistakes before he falls too deeply into self-doubt. After all, that happens to everyone, no matter how much training one has had.

### **Anazider** (2008-05-01 20:44:26)

"Make sure that you do, Shuttle Trireme. Carosi XII out." A skeptical grunt accompanies the message before the comm cuts out, a buzzing silence filling the cabin. Captain Deisser exhales a calming breath while shaking his head.
Arik deftly sets the shuttle down in the massive landing bay with a soft bump, the four starfighters of Maw squadron setting down in a protective formation around it.
*************
Both Nadia and Astur Vedek look towards where Esre and Kanner stand. The elderly missionary wears a look of grandfatherly admonishment, while Nadia's sympathy is clearly evident. The second attendant snorts with derision, before looking away with exaggerated disdain.
The slight rocking of the shuttle's landing jars everyone in the passenger hold. Astur Vedek unbuckles his safety restraint, standing with a creak and protest from very old joints.
"Safe and sound, and with small adventure all ready. Well, lets be about this, shall we?"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-05-02 10:29:28)

Arik lets out a longer breath as he releases the controls and slumps back in his chair. He throws a look in Kanner's direction, then returns his gaze forward to the front viewport.
*Hope his confidence hasn't taken too much of a hit. I know as well as anyone that problems can snowball once they've started.*
*Though*, his thoughts continue as he glances at Deisser, *gotta wonder how my little lie will turn out. Commended for quick-thinking? Berated for damaging the integrity of a diplomatic mission? I sure as hell hope none of the diplomats heard it at any rate.*
To distract himself from the unproductive and worrying direction his thoughts are taking, Arik leans forward over the control console and sets the comms to the frequency shared with the pilots of Maw squadron for this mission.
'This is *Trireme One*. Nice flying, Maw squadron. I couldn't have asked for a better escort: Holopic perfect as always. See you out in the hangar.'

Lothor returns Ariks gave with a cold stare of his own, when the alien turns away Lothor merely shrugs. With the shuttle landed Lothor stands and waits at the closed ramp. Awaiting orders Lothor stands guard at the ramp until an alternative is given, nodding to Cyrian to prepare himself as well.

### **Frost** (2008-05-05 14:24:40)

Cyrian catches Lothars nod and hops up. He grabs his gear and moves next to the senior officer.
"I'm ready to go Sir."
He wonders to himself about hanging around Lothar so much he seems to get himself in trouble alot and He didn't want that to rub off on him. Maybe he should distance himself a little.

### **Anazider** (2008-05-09 22:13:12)

A series of four clicks sound over the comm system, a silent reply to Arik's praise. Captain Deisser frowns at the firrereoan for a long moment, saying nothing. Shaking his head, the captain departs the flight cabin, striding right past Kanner and Cyrian to see to the ambassador and his retinue.
Nadia helps Astur Vedek to his feet and towards the boarding ramp, coming to stand with Kanner and Cyrian. When everyone has gathered, Captain Deisser activates the hydraulic ramp. A decompressing hiss accompanies the lowering of the ramp, as the hangar bay comes into view.
Natural starlight filters in through a ceraglass canopy, illuminating the bay with a pleasant glow. Ivy in varying shades of green, indigo and violet coat the walls, giving off an aroma reminiscent of a spice garden. A chill pervades the space, but the cold is more invigorating than biting.
Standing just at the foot of the ramp are a pair young Carosi women: both stand at just over a meter tall, with long, flat snouts and delicate fingers. They both wear garlands woven from the ivy that adorns the walls, and each bears a tray with bowls of water, steaming face towels, and a colorful assortment of fruits.
"The Carosi people bid you welcome, Ambassador Vedek. Please, accept these small gifts and leave your burdens in our care."
The two Carosi women say in unison, offering their trays to each member of the shuttle, their heads bowed.

Arik hangs back at the group's rear. For all his experience and smooth self-assurance, he is a working class man from Bastion. He has no prior experience of being offered water and towels after a flight and isn't sure what he should be doing with them. *Are they for my face? My hands? Both? Somewhere else? Maybe the Carosi have a ritual towel-sucking when they meet foreign diplomats…*
Not wanting to make a bad impression for the sake of the mission and his own pride, he waits and watches for the diplomats and his seniors to act first before taking his cue from them.

As the shuttle touches down, Esre gives Nadia a nod, before turning and moving towards the boarding ramp. Glancing around, Esre then tries to make a subtle motion towards Arik, a motion to come to her, as she assumes a position flanking the diplomatic entourage. Moving with the group, Esre is careful not overtly look too long in one direction, or at any one figure. The Carosai are known for being peaceful, but one can never tell when unsavory elements have infiltrated such a hospitable people. The military woman says nothing, her face a careful mask of neutrality. Esre is here as a guard, not as a diplomat, and so the woman acts the part given to her - gratefully. Diplomacy is not anything near her strong suit, after all.

### **master_Tru** (2008-05-12 06:02:23)

Lothor moves down the ramp to stand adjacent to Esre taking up a guards position. Lothor gives a slight motion with his finger to Cyrian to stand opposite himself , thus forming a line on both sides of imperial knights. Lothor stands motionless awaiting orders an occurrence, waiting to complete his part of the mission.

### **Frost** (2008-05-13 10:39:43)

Cyrian nods and quickly takes his position opposite of Lothar. he stands at the [position of attention eyes straight ahead. He starts a rythmic breathing pattern as he reaches out with the force and scans the area for any signs of danger.
