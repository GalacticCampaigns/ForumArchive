All of you are on the world of coruscant, in the single and giant city. You are walking towards the main military complex, and as you pass the numerous civilians, you hear worried whispers "I heard that a star destroyer had been captured by pirates" "No, I heard it was a hapan battle crusier"
"Someone in the navy said mon calamari had been raided" "What? that's crazy, no one is strong enough to do that"
the massive amount of rumors is overwhelming, but quiets down as you enter the complex. You go into an elevator and go up many floors.
eventually you reach a large room, with a long table. at the end stand 3 men in what look like jedi robes.
"welcome, please, sit down"

Exo-99 follows close behind Alexandria. His scanners searching the area for possible threats and escape vectors. He moves past Alexandria and pulls out a chair for her.
"Here mistress please have a seat."

Tagran ignores the various rumors, he prefers to get his information from more reliable sources. Once in the meeting room the Mandalorian chooses a seat that allows him to watch the door as well as the Jedi.

Courscant. The glittering city planet from space. The ever busy planet on its surface. It had been a while since she had been here last. Smuggling some arms for a group of settlers on a planet in the outer rim. *That was a good run. Not like the last one I recently had.* She thought to herself. She was brought out of her thoughts when she picked up bits and pieces of the gossip that had been going on. A lot of it sounded random. there was always some truth to be found in gossip and rumors. It all depended on how far one wanted to dig to find out.
Alexandra walked confidently across the walkway with EXO next to her as speeders of all types sped by over head. She kept her ears and eyes open for more gossip but it was all pretty much the same stuff. The one about Mon Cal being attacked was surprising considering it was one of the GA's main shipyards with a sizable defense fleet.
With the complex before them the crowds and speeder traffic quieted down. She could hear the sounds of EXO's metallic feet made on the ferrocrete. EXO had been a good addition. For a independent droid he was good to have around. He's was skilled enough to have helped her out with a few jams she's gotten into.
The elevator ride was long. "The higher we go up the more important the people are. Which is good as they also tend to pay well." She said to EXO. Upon exiting they were shown to a set of doors by a GA trooper. When the doors were opened Alexandra saw the large table take up a good portion of the conference room.
She moved towards a chair when EXO moved past her and pulled out a chair and offered it to her while calling her "mistress" again. She smiled and looked at him. "How many times have I told you you don't have to call me "mistress". She didn't now why she bothered as it was probably hardwired into his programming.
She looked at EXO and nodded in thanks and looked back to the three standing up front. "So we're here." Most who knew her knew she wasn't much for small talk when it came down to work. If they didn't they usually found out quickly.

Once Alexandria sits EXO moves away from the table and stands by the door. He scans the room for any signs of danger or evesdropping. He scans though frequencies trying to sense any sensors or recorders. He starts running his holorecorder making sure he has a good look at everyone.
Otherwise he hangs back and plays the role of protocol droid.

A young looking man with unruly light brown hair strides purposefully out of an airbus. He appears to be wearing a redwood coloured cloak over close fitting light tan robes. After over a week of self training at the New (New) Jedi Temple of Coruscant he had finally recieved an urgent call to duty. It has been about that long since his master had been sent out alone on a mission, having to spend his days reading, watching the Holonews and left to more practice.
Walking towards the Galactic Alliance Armed Forces HQ, passing the numerous civilians, he hears worried whispers...
"I heard that a star destroyer had been captured by pirates" "No, I heard it was a hapan battle crusier"
"Someone in the navy said mon calamari had been raided" "What? that's crazy, no one is strong enough to do that"
Once again Tafo thinks, *something is very wrong*. Having had a week to catch up with the news he was no stranger to troubling rumors and news reports mostly containing no comment from the authorities. He enters the stark silence of the Turbolift and ascends.
*That's better. More than the rumors, the feel of apprehension from all the people is… overpowering.* His thoughts turn to the meeting ahead
*I've never been summoned out like this before. While I've directly with the alliance before, it was previously through my master.*
Tafo Telon arrives in the meeting room, still pensive over the situation and is told to sit down by apparent Jedi, not officers. As he settles into a seat he looks at the Robed individuals trying to identify them.

Vita had left her ship at a small docking bay complex in one of the 'less' inhabited sectors. She found it advantageous to keep it's appearances in public down to a minimum. But because of this, she had a long journey across and up through the city. It was made easier by an Air Taxi, but still required a good deal of walking on her part. Rumors were the talk of the day in the streets of Coruscant. They gave warrant to Lord Grakis' concerns about the near future, and also to her presence on Coruscant.
More accustomed to small planetary governments and their officials, it was a bit overwhelming for her to walk into the Galactic Alliance Armed Forces Headquarters. Even more overwhelming when it occurred to her that she was here not only to represent Lord Grakis, but all of Arkania. Her lift ride was uneventful, except for the addition of a women and droid shortly after herself. Impossible not to overhear the conversation, Vita silently agreed with the women's appraisal of the situation. Indeed, the important people somehow always managed to take the high ground.
The meeting room brought an elevation to Vita's nerves. Though she'd never met a Jedi, she knew of them, and that her prized possession used to belong to one. It was this concern that almost made her regret bringing it. But, to her, it was a symbol of her position. Not wanting to bring attention to it, she sat near the far end of the table away from the prying eyes of the Jedi. With her arms crossed on the table, she awaited the meeting's start.

Xel'dan looks at the civilians with disdain , though with his helmet on they couldn't see it, there fear was made them weak and easily manipulated by false truths. Xel'dan's training taught him to perceive fear as a tool to seek the truth in certain matters, but he would not be one to feed upon these weak fools as his honor would be tarnished for it, as well as there was no truth to be gained from them. As he entered the room he removed his helmet and placed it on the table, as he sat he stared at the Jedi with an obedient look, as he had been told by his Saarai-kaar, ~You will obey the Jedi commands, as if they we're my own unless they should result in betraying our people and your teachings..~.
He notices out of his peripheral vision the others who had been gathered as well, he noticed the females we're much different then the ones he had trained with, they seemed weak and fragile but they exude confidence, as if they're appearance was a form of deception, he was curious about them but his loyalty to the Saarai-kaar came first.
Looking back at the Jedi, Masters he assumed with their confident stances the show no sign of fault, Xel'dan could show nothing short of respect and honor to ones he deemed powerful. "I am here on behalf of the Saarai-kaar of the Jensaarai, I am Defender Xel'dan Xond and on the Saarai-kaar's orders I am to extend my Loyalty to you, are allies, as if it was the Saarai-kaar Herself." Xel'dan speaks with a confident demeanor and conviction.
ooc: I am assuming the Saarai-kaar is female, but I will let you make the call on that Sacred.

Rohlan stands by the end of the table. With his helment on it is impossiable to tell his reaction to anything, if he allowed himself toshow much emotion at all. Sword on his back hands in front of him he stands there silently as if waiting for something to happen. Mucsles relaxed but ready for action.
He does not turst the people who have called on his servises, it is a contract nothing more. He is not to sure of the others either. He knows nothing of them, and he won't let any of them out of his site. He has been crossed before and the person who did that was nolonger among the living.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-28 17:19:56)

Devdan walked quielt among the crowds, his ears wide open to take in as much of the rumors and gossip as he could. It always seemed wise to have knowledge of such things. he didnÂ´t know why he had been summoned, but the jedi never called for him unless something was amiss. he was walking around in his usual clothing, and no one would ever take him for a jedi.
As he left the elevator, he looked around himself on the other people around him. They seemed like a varied lot of people, there were even a few armored warriors. You didnÂ´t see very many of those in the Galaxy. He guessed they were either mandalorians or jensaari. he takes a seat at the table, anxious to hear what the three jedi has to say.

kryser walks in last, sits down, being very *nervous* <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
THe jedi turn towards you. you see a zeltron, a selkath, and a miraluka.
the miraluka speaks to you all "welcome, we have called all 9 of you here for a very special purpose. For the sith have returned, and they are as strong as ever"
the mirakluka turns to Rohlan "do not be so skeptical, we will not betray you. "
"We are 3 members of the jedi council, and the galactic alliance has need of you all. You may have heard rumors out on the streets about captured ships, raids."
"They are all true. A hapan battle crusier was captured, as well as a star destroyer. what's worse is that on mon calamari, a star defender itself was taken."
" I have something I want you all to see. it's from the capture of the star defender"
A hologram of the bridge of the ship appears, you see jedi, and ga troopers all facing the doors to the bridge, with weapons at the ready. Suddenly the door explodes off and in it's place stands a robed man. the troopers open fire, the but the man moves with the swiftness of a star fighter, easily evading the bolts, the few that do strike him don't slow him down at all. suddenly, he raises his hand towards the troopers, and they all fall as if hit by a cannon ball. the jedi on the bridge ignite their sabers and move towards him, surrounding him, but the man jumps up and extends his arms, and the jedi are thrown back by an invisible force. The jedi near the holocam grunts and snarls "sith" and charges him, but the man lifts his arm, and out comes blue lightning, shocking the jedi to his death. the rest of the jedi freeze at this, and begin throwing objects at him with the force. as they approach the stranger, he takes them out of the air and throws them right back, killing two other jedi. THe last jedi remaining paces slowly towards him, lightsaber raised defensively.
The robed man finally speaks "Good, a council member, a fine challenge" he ignites his own saber, a deep crimson red. The two force users move at unbelievable speeds and all that you can track is the lightsabers moving in a whirl, making an almost blind display. the sith gains the upper hand though, and throws the jedi with the force into a wall, and unleashes lightning on him, and moving slowly closer to him, never releasing the lightning, the jedi struggles to move his hands to intercept the fearsome lightning, but as soon as he finally does so, the sith impales him with his lightsaber, and the jedi crashes to the floor, dead.
The whole bridge had been purged of life within seconds. the sith turns to the camera, and breaks it in one motion. the transmission fades.
the miraluka speaks again "do you understand the danger? One sith managed to defeat the crew of a whole star defender all on his own, not to mention 4 jedi, including a council member. Not to mention reports say that at the raid of mon calamari the sith had brought a ship even larger than a super star destroyer, and that was how they disabled the star defender."
"We know nothing of where the sith strike from, and that is your mission, to loctate them, and fight them"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-28 18:08:37)

the zeltron looks to you all, and turns to the side "do you think they can handle it, he says to the wall"
out of thin air an arkanian appears, smiling crookedly "Ah, yes, I think they can. But I don't think it would be wise to send them anywhere near the sith lord. out of all the jedi who could have fallen, it's always the most powerful ones"
"quiet" the miraluka repremands.
the selkath, with his watery voice, orders you "You will all now go to the planet of draethos, and try to find out where the sith hide. We suspect that they are near the draethos, and we wish you all to follow this lead. Now you may ask why the draethos, would allow you all to visit, but we have someone who will vouch for you"
the doors open, and a large draethos walks in, exotic weapons of all kinds strapped to his person. "I can garantee your safety on thosa. for few are stronger warriors than me."

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-28 19:07:23)

Xel'dan is still in awe of the Sith Lord from the Hologram, not showing it in his face but his Green Eyes reflect the image and shows the awe of his strength and conviction. Xel'dan looks at the Miraluka "Striking the Sith where they may hide is a cunning tactic but walking into a path of Darkness may lead us to Truths that some here may not comprehend or survive, you must treat them as a Viper, striking the Body will weaken it yes, but you must kill it by striking the Head if you wish to survive."
Xel'dan remembering that his Saarai-kaar told him the Jedi are not Aggressive in combat, but prefer a subtle approach then says "I will do as you ask for the Saarai-kaar, I will find the Truth to these Sith and where they hide in the Dark."

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-28 19:17:22)

you remember the sith are an ancient faction of the jedi who split of and followed the dark side of the force. the last known sith lord, was darth krayt, and he controlled much of the galaxy before dying.
you remember the draethos are a long lived species, and are rarely seen. Very few draethos aren't warriors, and those that aren't are exiled. It's even rarer to see a warrior draethos away from draethos.
thosa is the name of the planet draethos (that the draethos use instead of draethos)

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-28 19:22:12)

The miraluka turns stoicly to Xel'dan "strike the head? you mean to kill the sith lord seen in the hologram? I no not of any warrior that could defeat him at this moment. If you wish, I can tell you what we know of him"
"decades ago, after darth krayt died, cade skywalker found a boy. He was incredibly skilled at telekinesis, and all force powers in general. He was naturally charismatic and wise for his age. trained him we did, but during his training the boy becamed upset at the corruption of government, and it's inibility to help, in his opinion. before he took his trials, he left, and was never heard from again. But we believe that he is the sith, who has returned to destroy the GA, leading a new army of sith."
"For now, we can only hope to defeat his armies, while we figure out a way to stop him"

### **Thraken** (2008-09-28 20:00:37)

Tafo is surprised at being briefed by a number of Jedi Council members in the Headquarters, even more so by an outright admission of the Return of the Sith. But this does not appear on his face, appearing to have no reaction at all.
He watches the hologram grimly... well aware that jedi are far from invincible he is nonetheless dismayed that trained jedi and a single Jedi Master are so easily swatted aside by a single force user. And mostly with telekinesis no less...
After the holo ends the Miralukan Master continues.
"do you understand the danger? One sith managed to defeat the crew of a whole star defender all on his own, not to mention 4 jedi, including a council member. Not to mention reports say that at the raid of mon calamari the sith had brought a ship even larger than a super star destroyer, and that was how they disabled the star defender."
*Why do they need star defenders and other ships if they have something that large and powerful?*
The Council members finish the brief while Tafo gives the appearing Jedi a wry grin at his theatrics. *I haven't perfected a version of that myself yet…*
After listening to the armoured man's exchange with the council members he speaks up.
"Firstly Master, can you tell us what exactly leads you to believe this threat is in the vicinity of Draethos?"

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-28 20:30:32)

Miles is in shock that the council would hold so much knowledge against its own. Why would they wait so long to take action against this terror. [b*]"Firstly Master, can you tell us what exactly leads you to believe this threat is in the vicinity of Draethos*?" As the young tall jedi says this he wonders also what could the council couldnt be telling the rest of the galaxy.
Having a draethos outside of their home planet is a rare sight indeed. So many things poke at the brain and confuse the young jedi. But there is no reason to deny the council.
*"So when do we get to work"* Looking right at the miraluka.

### **Yogi** (2008-09-28 21:29:36)

Alex had seen and been in her share of fights but what happened on the bridge of the Star Defender was completely off the charts. That coupled that the confirmation that the rumors they had heard when walked the streets made her wonder just what the nine of them would accomplish that the entire bridge crew couldn't.
When asked if they had any questions Alex almost stifled her half chuckle but others ask away. Listening to them she was able to form some opinions. The Jensaarai was straight to the point. Go for the Sith Lord right away. *That would be a good way to die quickly. Too quickly if you ask me.* She thought to herself.
she looked to EXO standing of to the side playing his part of the dutiful protocol droid. Alex was sure he recorded the video and possibly the briefing. Good as it would give them the chance to go over this again later. The question about Draethos and why they were to go there. Made her turn around to hear the explanation.
Waiting for the questions and the answer that the Jedi asked as to when they are getting to work Alex asked her questions.
"Look how are we expected to help stop his armies? Will we have the ability to have direct communications with either the GA or the Council to let them know whats going on so the GA Navy ca show up and take care of the Sith fleet." She leaned forward to place her forearms on the table and continued. "I haven't gotten to where I am today by taking on jobs that have come with so little information. Not to mention the risk to me, my droid." She was keeping up the illusion that EXO was just a regular protocol droid. "Or my ship. I'm not going to beat around the bush here. I Imaging there is going to be some sort of compensation from the highly dangerous, and if I'm not mistaken, off the books mission?"
She was confident in her own abilities. Even more so at the controls of the *Wing.* But she knew right now that if this party came face to face with this new Sith Lord tomorrow. The outcome wouldnot be possitive.

### **Parmenter** (2008-09-28 21:52:57)

Vita watches, horrified by the display. One person, one... Sith. A single person was capable of all that. Why would they request her presence on this mission. What could she offer in a fight against such enemies? Vita looked around the table. What could any of them offer?
The men at the table didn't appear to be as shaken as she. Though, the armored man sitting next to her seemed to have a strong opinion on strategy, and how he didn't seem to like what the Jedi had in store for them. "But when you strike the body, the head must come to you to defend itself. Why go to the head, when you can make the head come to you?" Vita's translation was meant for the man next to her, but also, it was a clarification that helped out her own understanding of what might be in store for them.
Vita faced the council members once more, "Apologies, Masters." She said, "I didn't mean to speak for you, or presume to fully understand your plan." This man, this armored warrior clearly liked things simple, no room for deception, for subtlety.
The other women seemed to ask questions of an almost laughable nature. Money. The young Arkanian looked across the table at the female captain. "And what would you be doing if not this?
OOC: meant to post this immediately after Xandiel, so I added the last bit, hoping to get it to fit.

Xel'dan looks at the Attractive Female who commented on his suggestion, "You are quite cunning and I admire that in my enemies as much as my allies, what is your name?" Xel'dan is curious as to what the Lady has in mind and his earlier thoughts of the Females we're weak and Fragile, ~This one isn't to be taken lightly, I will have to keep my eye on her~ Then not wanting to offend her, he carefully chooses his words next "Though she knows little of the Sith, her tactic would work in our favor and quite effectively.." Xel'dan sighs" However I doubt this Sith Lord cares little about his Troops as it appears he is powerful enough to kill the Entire Council as well as my brethren Defenders and Our Saarai-kaar, which I can not allow."

### **Yogi** (2008-09-28 23:34:20)

"And what would you be doing if not this" the young woman asked her. Alex smiled the half smile that was tell tale when she might have hit a nerve on another person.
She turned to face the young woman. "What would I be doing? Good question. This is Courscant and if there was a center of activity in the galaxy this is it. I could do whatever I want. There is always people and cargo that need to be moved about. Most of it's work that no one bats an eye at. Some of it though people would rather certain types of, shall we say, planetary officials not know about. Either way there's always a job. And if there's a war on the horizon then there's even more reason to stay busy."
She looked around the room to those assembled. "Don't get me wrong The GA has always served and paid me well. And a stable government is better that chaos and anarchy. I'm smart enough to know that this new Sith army will bring just that along with an iron fist to rule and that just brings trouble to all."
Alex leaned back into he comfortable chair. "Besides I've been called here for a reason as we all were. I'd like to think that maybe it's because we're good at what we do. And there's nothing wrong with getting paid for doing something your good at is there."

The selkath turns to Tafo, and speaks "I have seen a vision of a war, it begins at draethos. that is why you must go there"
The miraluka responds to miles "you will leave as soon as possible."
The zeltron addresses alex and xel'dan "Master Qi-xon (the miraluka) and myself will lead the fight against the sith with what armies and navies we have. you all must strike the siths base itself. I do not believe you will be in contact with us often, though master xalta (the selkath) can send you telepathic thoughts. One thing not mentioned about the sith lord, when we knew him, he had an excellent mind for tactics and government. To me, it seems that he wished to make a statement to us, calling us out to do battle. Your pay will be excellent, though you will have to be discreet, the fewer who know of you all, the better"

Tagran watches the recording in silence. When the true nature of the threat becomes clear he frowns, though itâ€™s not visible behind his helmet. Tag thinks to himself â€˜Darjetii, jetti, theyâ€™re two sides of the same credit when it comes down to it. But the two refuse to get along and they drag the whole galaxy into their conflicts.â€™ As the others ask their questions he watches with interest, noting their reactions to both their hosts and each other. Heâ€™ll hold off asking any questions of his own till the others have had their say.

The doors open, a mandalorian in full armor walks through "I apologize for my tardiness. Are all the plans finalized?"
The miraluka doesn't even react at all, as if he knew he would enter "Yes, they are. are your ori-ramikade ready?"
"As many as were left"

### **Valheru** (2008-09-29 00:24:10)

If thereâ€™s one thing Tagran values more than his armor itâ€™s the sanctity of his own mind. The heat in his gaze as he looks at the jedi is somehow noticeable even through his helmt, â€œStay out-â€œ. He breaks off when the door opens. Tag is so shocked by the Mandaloreâ€™s sudden appearance that his reaction is visible for once. He stands and nods to the man, about as differential as Mandos get, â€œMandalore. Su'cuy gar! Tion banar?â€.

The Mandalorian looks at the Jedi that seemed to be reading his mind without his permission, not that he would have given it. "Carefull Jedi. If you try that again, I will add your saber to my collection."
When his leader entered the room, Rolhan bows his head in recinision of his presance. "Greetings Mandalore." After hearing of the attack on there home world. "Mandalore should are place not be with our people? We need to increase the defences of the home world to keep the Sith from trying this again."

master Qi-xon scowls and suddenly the force pinning rohlan is released, and slowly levitates and drops to a standing position "There will be NO fighting between us. I know you are angry, but you know why you can't go with them"

Tag doesnâ€™t appreciate the jediâ€™s telepathic, or telekinetic, abuses anymore than Rohlan but he keeps his peace. Still heâ€™s relieved Qi-xon resolved things quickly, heâ€™d hate for things to get messy. Over an open channel Tag whispers a message. Aloud he asks the jedi â€œAnything else before we get underway?â€.
[hide]â€œ[Mandoâ€™a]Easy comrade, one doesnâ€™t provoke a jedi master unless youâ€™ve already shot him. Mandaloreâ€™s right, we can do more for our people with the jedi than against them.â€[/hide]
OOC: I expect Rohlan, Mandalore, and EXO would receive the message but no one else will hear unless they have an open comlink right now.

The exchanges go on with Tafo watching and listening well, by now the number odd odd circumstances make the impact of mandalore's entrance highly manageable. Yet the appearance of Master Wu and his outburst against the Mandalorian called Rohlan concerned him...
"Masters, I would like to ask why exactly those of us gathered here have been chosen for this mission."
Looking around he sees the Mandalorians - known for thousands of years as strong fighters, a tall woman and her droid apparently some kind of freighter crew, an armored man - probably not just for show, two Jedi Knights and another person. As he has not yet attained knighthood, he feels just somewhat outclassed. *Why am I here?* he thinks

### **Yogi** (2008-09-29 08:19:15)

Alexandra wasn't surprised at the difference of opinion that was evident between the Masters. It was evident since the meeting started. Yes this mission was not going to be easy. As if it wasn't bad enough that there were Mandalorians, Jedi and independent operators in this group. *As long as their good in a fight that's all that matters. I got a feeling that there will be more than one before this is over.*
After Tafo's questions were answered Alex spoke up again.
"Well the sooner we get going the better." She rose and rested her right hand on on her blaster that was holstered low. It was a natural resting place for it. "
She looked at the assembled group. "So who needs a lift to Draethos."

Xel'dan watching the Jedi Masters Flaunt his powers and the Mandalorians boast their strength, he simply sighs softly as he is disgusted by these meaningless taunts they give one another, he then rises up and grabs his helmet and simply says "I believe I have had enough of this Childish behavior, I will require transportation..." then Xel'dan looks at the the two females "I assume you both are the ones with ships, as the other males here are Jedi who don't require a ship, and the others seem to arrogant to be able to fly one." he awaits an answer, and for the female he asked her name to introduce herself as well...

### **ganthet** (2008-09-29 10:08:22)

After the he is released Rohlan quickly checks over is armor and gear. "I will follow the will of Mandalore and help you with your problem. Can I assume that any other information will be forth coming and we get get the mission started." His tone has a small bit of anger in it but the he quickly recovers his composure. "If there is nothing else I have preperations to make you can contact me on my ship." Turnuing to leave the room he stops and turns looks at his leader bows his head in repect then exits the room.

### **Frost** (2008-09-29 10:59:49)

EXO watches the Jedi and Madalorians butt heads and doesn't react as long as there was no danger to himself or Alexandria his combat programs wouldn't initiate. He had just rewritten them and was looking forward to testing them out. He calculated the odds of who would win between them but was unable to come to a conclusion due to the unknown factor of the "force" and its effect on the sitiuation. He had heard it said that the force was in everything and he wondered if it was locked awayinside of him.
He hears something over his comlink and runs it through his translator he tracks the signal as coming from Tag.
â€œ[Mandoâ€™a]Easy comrade, one doesnâ€™t provoke a jedi master unless youâ€™ve already shot him. Mandaloreâ€™s right, we can do more for our people with the jedi than against them"
He responds in Mando'a

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-29 12:45:27)

Devdan just sits quietly aside, listening and watching, as he always does. He must say he was quite impressed with the Sith Lords display of power. No wonder the council feared him, as he was sure they did. The others were right, how could they hope to fight something like this? It would not be easy, that was for sure, but there had to be a way. There always was.
He was quite curious as to how this briefing would continue, and remained silent, while he sought to process all information he gathered.

### **Valheru** (2008-09-29 14:08:11)

Tagran can't help but chuckle at the irony in Xel'dan's little barbs but lets them pass without comment. He looks at Alexandra, "I would appreciate a ride as well."
Tagran is intrigued by EXO's response. 'Hm, a droid with a sense of humor. Perhaps there's more to this one than meets the eye,' he thinks. Tag responds to the droid.
[hide][Mando'a]Heh, true enough.[/hide]

The miraluka eyes you all "You have all been gathered because you all possess the necessary skills. Yes, this is a large group, but redundency is a safeguard."
The draethos clears his throat and speaks in his loud raspy voice "And from now on, I will answer all questions. Now, I will need transportation as well."

---

### **Yogi** (2008-09-29 16:52:20)

Alex hears that several are needing a lift. "I can take most of us but it looks as if there is more than one ship. With what we're heading into if you can handle ships weapons, ships computers or know your way around an engine room I can use you. Even if you can't there's room for you." She looked around at those in the room. "I'm Alexandra Davion, Captain of *Freedom's Wing.* I'm at docking pad 2387 in case you have any belongings you need to get. I imagine we'll be leaving soon."
She looked at the Masters and nodded. "Good luck, you're going to need it." She said as she exited the briefing room and waited outside for those that needed transportation.

### **Frost** (2008-09-29 17:11:09)

Exo follows behind Alex as they leave the briefing. Once they are far enough away Exo speaks.
"This seems like a very unorganized plan. I am calculating very low odds of success."

"I have a ship that can maybe take one more...if they are willing to squeeze a bit. But IÂ´ll preferabÃ¶y ride alone in it"
As Devdan gets up and ready to leave, he looks over to the droid and shakes his head.
"Of course you do, you are a droid. TheyÂ´ve yet to create an artificial intelligence that can think unorganized"

Vita watched the meeting continue, and jumped slightly at the sight of an Arkanian Jedi's appearance. She wondered if he shared the views of his peers. If he even noticed her. With his presence, Vita became distant, silent. Instead of contributing to the meeting, she merely watched and listened. Though shock hit her face when threats were answered by a show of force, literally.
It was the other woman who finally spoke up with a desire to get the mission underway. Vita smirked. If she were the other woman, she would have asked for a contract stating the compensation and terms of agreement. Then again, the clients were Jedi, known for being fair and trustworthy. Much different from the usual groups that Vita was accustomed to dealing with.
With the meeting drawing to a close, talk of transportation perked her ears. Without much hesitation, she turned to the armored warrior next to her. Despite his appearance, she felt him worthy of her trust given his contributions to the meeting. "I can offer you travel arrangements. I'm Vita, Vita Hitori," she said, hand extended. One thing she didn't want, however, was to ferry a lot of people. But then again, maybe that was just her secretive nature, unwilling to trust those she didn't know. "I could offer transportation to all, but I'm sure it would be to our mutual disadvantage, as Master Qi-xon said, redundancy is a safeguard. Not too mention, we're all going to the same place. No sense going in discomfort."

Tagran is wearing just about everything he owns, but he does have a small bag with a change of clothes and a few odds and ends with him. He follows Alexandra out, nodding to Mandalore as he passes, â€œRe'turcye mhi.â€ Outside he says, â€œThe nameâ€™s Tagran Malorn.â€
OOC: I assume you weren't talking to me Parmenter, but please be more specific there's three armored warriors in this little army! <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> Otherwise I'll revise this post.

Telon looks at the departing groups before regarding the rather impressive assemblage of hosts once again.
"Well." He stands and addresses the Draethos "It seems transport is taken care of, would you like to discuss the mission ahead onboard so that everyone gathered here may attend to more important matters, or-" he Tafo turns to the Jedi and Mandalore "- do you have more to add? In either case Masters, I would also like to request a copy of the holorecord that you just showed to us."

Xel'dan takes his hand back and grabs his helmet "Let us take our leave if you are ready my lady." Xel'dan the puts his helmet on and follows Vita to her ship.

Rohlan enters the hanger where his ship is docked. It has been his home for awhile now. He visits his family on Mandalore but most of his time is spent making his way in the galaxy. He comms his droid Caretaker that he is outside the ship and to lower the loading ramp.
Once inside he remove his helment and his Vibrosword and starts to check over his gear for the mission. Caretaker busys himself with the maintance of the ship, weilding and repairing anything that is needed.

Vita waited inside the conference room, both for any in need of a ride, and also to eavesdrop what little more information she could from the Jedi. She eyed Xel'dan's armor with interest as he donned his helmet. She got the feeling that he was a Jedi, only not. As they waited she leaned toward the side he stood on, "What are you? You seem to know a bit more about the Jedi than I do, though I must admit I haven't actually met one until today." Her words, simple and friendly. "Hmm, seems like speaking up first has it's advantages." She said, covering up her relief that she would not be carrying a lot of people. "Let's go shall we?" She raised an arm to gesture her departure from the room. "You can tell me more about yourself on the way, don't worry, we've got a long walk ahead of us."

---

### **Yogi** (2008-09-30 08:37:07)

Alex waited outside for the others to file out. "Looks like we have an interesting time ahead of us EXO. What do you think?"
After EXO answered him one of the Jedi that had been summoned to the meeting spoke to her. She nodded as he spoke. "Yes you may and yes you can call me Alex. Do you have ship board skills that I should know about before we go. In all likely hood we should expect some trouble."

### **Frost** (2008-09-30 10:33:31)

Exo's photoreceptors turn towards Alex.
"I do not have enough tactical data to make decision how ever if I was to, what is the human expression?, "Hazard a guess" I would say our odds are not good. Like I stated before I do not have enough information at this time."

---

### **ganthet** (2008-09-30 11:30:53)

Finishing his checks Rohlan heads out of his ship and heads back towards the meeting room. He is looking for the other Mandalorian that was there. He looks around, most likely he would be still at the meeting room. With his sword and assualt blaster rifle on his back. He looks as if he would be ready to fight a war right now. But that is not his perpose at the moment.

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-30 11:35:21)

As Xel'dan walked with Vita to her ship his voice was someone mechanical coming from his helmet "I am a Jensaarai, which is a Sith word for hidden follower of the truth, as a Defender of the Jensaarai it is my duty to defend that truth." Xel'dan looks at Vita "We are not evil, though some would not consider us good either." His looks at Vita for anything that is out of place, as he is walking with her.

"Thank you." Tafo accepts the datapad. *I shall be able to study the movements of this so called sith at least…*
he looks back at the rapidly emptying room for a moment before regarding the Draethos again. "I would like to accompany you on the journey in order to discuss the mission ahead, so whichever vessel you choose I would like to follow." after a pause he continues.
"And I am Tafo Telon, what is your name?"

Alex was outside the room and watched Vita walk off with one other. *Well I guess I get to take the others. That at least should ensure that EXO and I will have some help if we make contact with any Sith forces.* She thought to herself. She walked back to the conference room and poked her head in and grabbed the attention of the others still inside.
"It looks like Vita, who has a ship capable of taking people has already left so the rest of you get to go with me." She looked at the Jedi Masters who were talking together and raised her voice a bit so they could hear her. "Master Qi-xon I assume that the contract and half of the payment will be forwarded to me before we leave."
After receiving her answer she looked at those that would be going with her and EXO. "Shall we. We have a decent jump ahead of us." She looked at EXO as they started. "So low chance of success huh? Good maybe they won't be expecting someone so soon then."

"People would say the same of me." Vita explained, "I'm...well it's complicated, I'm a negotiator for ARKco Industries. I'm called upon to see a deal through, period." She skirted around the issue that some, back on Arkania, would call her less gracious names. Also, that her negotiations usually ended with a few deaths. The world of business has a harsh environment, and if a company wants to succeed they need to make it happen. The companies that made up ARKco had each learned that lesson over a millenia ago, and each brought their own way of making it happen to the table.
"I like my privacy, which is why my ship is down in the Industrial levels," she apologized.

Alex and her group reached her ship. As she released the security system the boarding ramp lowered. "Welcome aboard. EXO and I will see to the preflight. I'd like to mention again that if we encounter any problems en route if you can help out somewhere with systems or weapons we would appreciate it. I'll give you two the quick tour when we're off."
She headed up the ramp and showed them the passenger area. Heading off to the cockpit she found EXO already running though the *Wing's* start up. "I don't know about you but I have a bad feeling about this one." She said to EXO. "I'm not sure if it's the Sith coming back or the lack of information they were giving us. Maybe both. We better be ready for anything."
She continued to run through systems and weapons checks when she was satisfied she looked at her co-pilot. "Looks like we're ready to go."
When the *Wing* was ready to go she commed Vita and the others. (OCC: I would imaging we swapped comms before we all left) "*Freedom's Wing* to *Due Diligence* We'll meet you space side and link up for coordinates."
With practiced ease that comes from a lifetime of flying she skillfully lifted off and pointed the *Wing* towards space heading for the rendezvous with the others.

## Journey to the Center of Coruscant.

### **Parmenter** (2008-10-01 09:34:54)

Deep in the city, miles below the surface of Coruscant Vita led the group. The hangar was owned by ARKco, but for the purpose of waste management. It was a garbage dump for their Coruscant branches, until every few weeks the waste hauler came and took it away. Thankfully, the waste hauler had been their the day before, but still, the smell of the hangar was fierce. She felt sorry for the Draethos warrior, whom she assumed had an excellent olfactory system. The one person probably not quite as affected was the armored Jensaari.
Punching in a few codes on her ship, the passenger ramp lowered and all boarded. Vita was quick to raise the ramp, and then adjust the environmental controls to extract the smell from her ship. "Tour is going to have to wait, we should leave now." She said, leading the small group to the cockpit. An astromech droid met them in the hall, and began beeping and whistling. Vita nodded in response, "Good, glad to hear it." The little droid had monitored her approach and started powering the ships systems. "That's Tooty, my ship's mechanic." The droid howled in disgust. "What am I supposed to call you then? I'm not calling you 'The Ark.'" Clearly, the two had a reluctant friendship.
Shortly thereafter the ship was running on repulsors, and exiting the foul bay. The return to the surface was considerably quicker than the journey down, outside the viewport you could almost see millenia pass by, encased in time by the architecture on each level. As they approached the surface the comm sprang to life with words from Alexandra.
"Copy that Davion, we're just breaking the surface now, should be ready for the jump soon."

Moving aside to a small landing platform, Devdan slips into his ship, *The Spectral Vonskr*. Powering up the engines, he takes off, quietly scanning the other ships, storing their sensor data in his databanks. You can never have too much information.
Breaking into the atmosphere, the black ship veered and ajusted its course to meet the other ships.
"This is the *Vonskr*, ready to head out"

### **Frost** (2008-10-01 10:35:34)

EXO takes a sensor sweep of the other ships and programs thier transponder codes into the ships IFF system so if battle does happen then they would show up as friendly targets to the ships sensors. It would be a shame to accidently target a friendly ship for destruction. He begins calculations for hyperspace jump.
"All systems are green and hyperdrive coordinates are plotted. I am ready to transmit data to the other ships for syncronized jump. We are ready to go when you are Captain."
When he is on ship all pretense of being a protocol droid drop and EXO becomes a quick and decisive ships officer.

Xel'dan never really had been around a starship before other then the transport that brought him to Corusant. Xel'dan decided to stay out of the way as he would be a hinderence to those who could fly a ship as he heads into a corner of the ship which appears to be cargo hold and removes his helm and sits to meditate.

Rohlan hears Tag speck over his comm inside his helment. Activating his external speckers. "I was just checking if we where ready to leave yet. Do you require transport?" Rohlan looks around to see if any of the others that where called. "i am heading back to my ship, if you need a ride follow me." Rohlan turns and head back to the hanger.

Mal-to having chosen a vessel, Tafo tags along as all parties appear to be on their way offworld. *Thank the force I learned to travel light.* He pats his side and checks his belt unseen underneath his cloak to make sure his utility belt and travel pack were in place. In the past before joining the Jedi Order he had a penchant for packing for every possible circumstance on a mission. This usually involved a field kit plus a wide assortment of items stuffed in it.
Following the striking woman and the armored man, the man turns to address us.
"I am Xel'dan Xond" He nods "We should make haste and continue are introductions along the way." he looks back forwards and asks "If you would lead the way Vita."
At this Tafo nods in return and introduces himself. "I am Tafo Telon." And the journey to the ship continues
------------------------------
the group was led to sleek and compact looking transport that Telon had never seen before. He hoped the ship handled as good as it looked.
------------------------------
once on board he asked of Vita "Would you like any assistance on this mission? I used to serve in the Navy on a scout ship, and I can operate pretty much any system on a ship."

### **Valheru** (2008-10-01 15:16:39)

Tagran nods to Rohlan, â€œThanks, but Alexandra has already offered.â€ He does exchange com codes with the other Mando though so they donâ€™t have to use an open channel. With that he follows the group to the *Freedom Wing*.

"Thanks EXO. I'll let them know we're ready." Alex raised the other three ships. "This is *Freedom's Wing* we have the course plotted to our destination and are ready to send the coordinates." Alex made sure to slow down her hyperdrive to match the others. It would not be prudent to arrive hours or days ahead of the others depending on their speed.
She checked over the systems satisfied that all were in the green. she spoke to her c0-pilot. "When they confirm they are ready send the coordinates on a tight beam transmission to each ship. and begin the count down timer."

Vita was more than willing to play follow the leader for now. Despite her position, she was not a leader. Leaders made plans, had people do things for them. She, she was a doer. She took orders, saw them through, usually in her own way though.

During the flight Tagran finds a place where he can lay out his equipment and inspect it. He takes apart his various weapons and cleans them before putting them back together again. Tag never seems to remove his armor except for his helmet; which he always keeps within arms reach.

### **Yogi** (2008-10-02 12:42:59)

The stars elongated as the *Wing* entered hyperspace. According to the readouts it was going to take them about a day. She sighed a little and looked at EXO. "Well if we had made the jump by ourselves it would only have taken eighteen hours or so." She said as she checked over the systems and saw that all were running in the green.
"Shall we go back and get acquainted with or passengers?" She rose and turned to leave. Walking down the short corridor that lead form the cockpit to the passenger area she listened to the sounds of her ship. It was odd but she could sense by the vibrations of the ship if something wasn't quite right.
Alex finds Tagran at the table going over his equipment with the Jedi sitting close by. She sat down across from the armored man. "It will be about a day till we reach our destination. So we will have a bit of time to ourselves."

==========================================================================
Once onboard he hovers at the rear of the cockpit as the jump to lightspeed is made. *I miss flying.*
"Well then. If you need me I'll be with our local guide down below."
After concluding the conversation he finds Mal-to.
"Greetings. As I mentioned before I'd like to discuss the mission." After they settle into seats he continues
"We're looking for a base of some sort... do your people have some observational means that would be useful? Such as a navy or trade fleet that would be aware of the surrounding spaceways and a way to track unusual occurances on your world itself?"

Machinery whirled to life, and computer terminals beeped confirmations. Outside the stars stretched and they were away in Hyperspace. With that finished, Vita informed the passengers of their arrival time. "Should be there in a day. We should have food and rest somewhere in that time frame." Her eyes were drawn at last to the lightsaber Xel'dan wore on his person. She continued, her voice trailing off. "And, perhaps we'll find ways of entertaining one another."
"Would you accompany me?" Her eyes were still on Xel'dan, but she motioned with her arms to the others as well. Leading the processional from the cockpit to one of the group bunk quarters. "Perhaps a little exercise will keep the mind occupied, as well as the body." She had never had a chance to spar against another lightsaber before. She only hoped he was talented enough to restrain himself and not cut off her other arm. Reaching down to her belt she brought up her gift from Lord Grakis and ignited it. "Care to spar a little? I promise I won't hurt you." She toyed, flicking her wrist to motion the blade in front of her with a flourish. Her arm outstretched down to the side, blade nearly touching the floor. It's blue light gave a new hue to the colors in the room.

Still concentrating on his work Tag nods to Alexandra, "That should give us plenty of time to prepare." After he finishes with the pistol he'd been cleaning he looks up at the woman, "Thanks for the ride, by the way."

---

### **Frost** (2008-10-02 16:20:05)

EXO looks at the pistol the unit designated Tag was cleaning.
"Pardon me is that a Blastech DL-44? It is incredibly rare to find one in such good working order much less working."

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-02 17:38:59)

Following the others into hyperspace, Devdan relaxes from the flying, and goes into a Force trance. Perhaps he should have taken a passenger with him.

"No, my people do not possess special observatory means, but that is not why we believe the sith we come there. I have been told the reason the sith will come there is to ask the draethos to fight with them, to recruit them. I do not honestly believe this has chance of success, but at the same time, it's a valuable opportunity to find where the sith hide"

---

### **Thraken** (2008-10-02 19:20:06)

Tafo nods slowly "Yes... there are several avenues we can track in this case. We can track inbound and outbound missionary ships to find their likely rallying point, check with the draethos leaders to see if anyone had come to solicit their strength and lie in wait if they haven't already arrived..." After a pause he continues.
"How will your people react to our presence? We are mandalorians, jedi and other types. We're obviously no sightseeing group. Will they have a problem with any of us?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-02 19:23:31)

"They will be very agressive, there may be fights, of course, my presence will reduce such encounters. The biggest problem will be the aristocrats, they are very difficult to deal with. I've been told to expect that the sith will be there already, so be warned."

---

### **Thraken** (2008-10-02 20:03:55)

And he did frown at that part.
"I see... Well. I suppose If they are there already the best we can hope for is navigational data from their ships or any data storage they have. Questioning a captured enemy is a poor second to that. If all goes even worse, then its chasing down escaping ships..." He pauses a moment as his mind starts going through preparations. "Well. Is there anything else you would like to add Mal-to?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-02 20:28:11)

" no, I have nothing else to add, I should get some rest now"
the next day all of your ships arrive into draethos space

---

### **Valheru** (2008-10-02 22:33:28)

Tag glances at EXO, "Actually it's a Merr-Sonn Power 5, but they're very similar weapons. The biggest visible distinction is the lack of a scope, but it's also made of slightly lighter materials. You're right though, they are old, but if you take care of them they'll take of you. My father gave them to me, when he realized I was ambidextrous." That's the longest anyone on the ship has heard him speak since meeting him. The Mandalorian begins working on another weapon, almost as if he's used up his 'speech quota'.

Xel'dan follows Vita to the Group Bunk Quarters and Puts his Helmet on one of the beds, "If you wish, but it is unusual for a Non-Force Sensitive to wield a Lightsaber." Xel'dan's view on Vita has changed considerably to a mere interest to more of an urge to know more, but he keeps himself focused for the Duel ahead. "Let us begin.." he ignites his Silver Bladed Lightsaber and stand in a Strong Form, holding the Lightsaber with both hands and slightly above his head. Xel'dan looks at her seeing she is still unsure of her weapon "I will not harm you with my blade I swear, but I will not let you win either." He says trying to comfort her so as to convey his wish in not harming her.

Xel'dan accepted her challenge, and ignited his blade. There it stood, they stood, for nearly a minute the two remained stationary. Vita was in the habit of waiting for the other to make the first move, but it was obvious Xel'dan wanted to see her competence with the weapon before fully engaging her in combat. *Fine.* She thought as she shifted her weight to move. With three steps she closed the distance between them, her third being a twirl, leading into an easily blocked two-handed swing from the side. The sabers connected, hissing, screeching; an unfamiliar sound to Vita. After a second she released the attack and spun back one step. She shifted the lightsaber to her right hand came at him again. The style, was flashy and full of honorific stances, not something typically used with a lightsber, but it was what she'd been trained in.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-03 07:07:29)

Alerted and taken out of his trance by the signal that he had arrived at his destination, Devdan again took his place in the pilots chair and opens up a comm channel to the other ships.
"Everybody ok? Perhaps our "guide" can tell us where to proceed next"

The duel between you two goes on, with Xel'dan using his strength and Vita her fencing, but with Xel'dan eventually pushing Vita pack to the wall, and disarming her of her weapon.
In all of your minds (all the pilots I mean) you hear Mal-to speak to you with telepathy "Move slowly, transmit code 8216106, you'll see them soon enough"

### **Valheru** (2008-10-03 18:37:35)

By the time they exit hyperspace Tagran has completed his maintenance routine and returned his gear to their respective positions. He stands and dons his helmet, "I'll man one of the turrets, just in case."

Alex heard the automatic alarm notifying her that the ship was nearing its coordinates. "We're almost there. Be ready we don't know what to expect." She rose and made her way to the cockpit and strapped herself in. Moments later the *Wing* reverted back to realspace and once again the canopy was filled with stars. She began going over systems checking functionality when strangely she heard the voice of Mal-to in her head telling her what to do. Shaking her head a bit at the uneasy feeling it caused her she complied. She kept the *Wing's* throttle down to about one-third and keyed in the code that was given to her and hit the transmit button. "Keep your eyes open XO. They should be out there. Be ready with the shields though."

Xel'dan shuts off his Lightsaber and looking Vita in her eyes he notices his heart racing more then usual, "I enjoyed this spar with you....I trust I did not harm you?"Xel'dan then collects himself and waits to see if she heard the message as well.

Mal-to speaks up to tafo "They better be transmitting that sequence, or they'll be shot up pretty quick, and they better not fire on anything either. But for now, I must contact someone"
Mal-to closes his eyes and telepathically reaches with his mind to what appear to be empty portions of space.

Rohlan was practicing with his Vibrosword while he was waiting for Caretaker to alert him when they came out of hyperspace. Most of the time it was just him and the driod. He had people on the ship now and then but most of the time it was just the two of them. After his practice setion he cleans up and dawns his armor and readys his gear. He programs the comm number Tag had given him into his comm system.
When Caretaken alters him that they are coming out of hyperspace near there destenation. He moves to the cocpit and takes the controlls. He sets the scanners to activtes after he jumps to real space. Caretaker rolls up besides Rohlan and uses his data port to plug in to the ships systems to aid his master.

## The voices in my head...

### **Parmenter** (2008-10-04 02:04:00)

Vita laid on her bunk, her mind busy recalling the duel the day before. She had always considered herself good with the weapon. Did one's connection with the Force make them that much better? Or was there a fault in her fighting style. She assumed the latter, though agile, her quick weak hits didn't seem to compare to the brute force used by her opponent.
The Hyperdrive's proximity alarm began to sound in Vita's cabin, and across the ship. Throwing herself to her feet, she hurried to the cockpit for the reemergence into real space. A flash of light, stretch of stars and they were back, only this time near the planet of Thosa. As Vita began to throttle up for an approach to the planet she heard the Draethos, Mal-to, speak. Looking behind her, she soon realized he wasn't there, that he was communicating in another form altogether.
Unsure of how his abilities worked, Vita nevertheless complied with his instructions. Entering formation with the *Freedom's Wing*, she copied Alex' speed and heading, she inputted the designated code and awaited the unknown.

Receiving the code, and entering it into the system, Devdan puts the *Vonskr* in line with the other ships. He hopes they will get planetside soon, as his ship isnÂ´t really a fighter.

### **Thraken** (2008-10-04 08:57:42)

===retcon===
Having concluded his discussion with Mal-to he strode off to find the others. He was quickly drawn to the familiar hum and crackling of lightsaber blades and was somewhat surprised to see the two duelling with lightsabers.
Tafo watched the fight from the doorway, fascinated as he had always been by lightsaber use. Xel'dan's style was simple but effective, most resembling Shii-Cho in its strong strikes. Vita's style was some type of sword fencing, with a strong basis in open moves and stances. Eventually Vita was robbed of her mobility, pushed up against the wall. With no more room to give, a strong push with his silver blade twisted the blue lightsaber from Vita's hands. The hilt clattered across the floor with the blade safely disengaged.
*Too many unnecessary movements. Though the style is flexible enough for some combat use.* He grinned and shook his head at his own critique. Once again he felt the urge to try himself against new opponents.
After it seemed the two were done with each other he spoke up. "I talked to our guide. Seems he's been told to expect the Sith at Draethos. On this kind of visit I think it's probably best to assume the worst..."
====================================================================================
As hyperspace reversion finishes, Mal-to had closed his eyes sending out his message. he speaks "They better be transmitting that sequence, or they'll be shot up pretty quick, and they better not fire on anything either. But for now, I must contact someone". Keeping his eyes closed the Draethos turns silent.
Tafo watching the man at work was somewhat unnerved by the apparent strength and precision of his telepathic skills. Nonetheless he stood ready at the doorway, prepared to run for a gunnery station if things went bad. He had already changed into his travelling attire and left his Jedi robes stowed in a cabin. Unless someone got wholly inappropriately up close and personal with him, he would seem like just another Fringer.

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-04 11:18:13)

Xel'dan hearing the Alarm awakens him from his meditative sleep, he begins putting his armor back on and as he finishes he head to the cockpit passing by Tafo noticing his apparent wardrobe change, "They will sense us by the time we get off our ships, but your disguise may buy you a momentary advantage if they come after you." Xel'dan knows he will stand out with his armor and all the better to attract the stronger opponents to him. THen looking towards the direction of Vita and the cockpit he looks back at Tafo "Why did you not challenge either of us, I could see you were eager but you did not act on it, why?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-04 13:36:48)

As your ships slowly approach Draethos (the planet), the jedi feel a prickling of people watching their ships. As they recieve this feeling, ships appear from out of empty space, apparently de-cloaking, including a heavy crusier.
This cruiser hails all of your ships and speaks in raspy basic "Why have you come hear? Surely nothing can be so important to intrude in our space. You are lucky Mal-to is my friend, or I would have opened fire on you almost immediately. I can only assume from Mal-to's personal code that this matter is very important. Now, follow my escorts down to the planet, and do not stray at all"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-04 13:54:50)

"Copy that"
Devdan starts to watch for the escorts, ready to adjust his course not as to appear straying. Meanwhile, he runs a heavy sensor sweep, trying to gather as much intel on the enemy ships as possible.
((If the ships are within 30 squares of us, I can make sensor checks as a reaction right? Otherwise IÂ´ll spend move actions to gather as much data as possible. Use Computer +11))

The fighters around you are stealth attack fighters, ones not ever seen in the galaxy, suggesting secret draethos technology. The cruiser though, is repeling your sensor sweeps, with some special technology.

### **Thraken** (2008-10-04 16:22:48)

Leaning against the doorframe Tafo regarded the large suit of armour that appeared and speaks to him. "They will sense us by the time we get off our ships, but your disguise may buy you a momentary advantage if they come after you."
*…he must have spotted my robes when we were on our way to the ship.*
"perhaps." was his only reply to that. Xel'dan continues after a moment.
"Why did you not challenge either of us, I could see you were eager but you did not act on it, why?"
"I forgot." Tafo replies with a raised eyebrow. "I left the two of you as you had exerted yourselves. For the rest of yesterday I had been reviewing the holos of the Sith's lightsaber technique and before I knew it everyone had retired for the night."

## Well, that's a fine how d'ya do.

### **Parmenter** (2008-10-04 16:56:22)

Vita was a rare mix of shocked and curious. The ability to make a ship invisible. She would have to ask Lord Grakis about that. With a quick glance back to Mal-to, she thought. *Surely the Arkanians would have mastered such a thing long before this species.* Despite her prejudices, she followed her instructions.
Falling in formation behind the fighters, she then turned to the others in the cockpit. "Well, so much for a warm welcome."

---

### **Yogi** (2008-10-04 19:10:40)

Alex looked at EXO who sat next to her. "Warm welcome huh. Go ahead and power down the weapon systems. They have enough firepower here to overwhelm us" She fell into line with their escorts. *Interesting tech though. The ability to cloak could be invaluable.*

### **Valheru** (2008-10-04 22:27:09)

Needless to say Tag is impressed by the draethos' cloaking technology. Over the *Wing's* internal com he says, "I'd thought stygium crystals were impossible to get a hold of these days. I wonder if they've managed to create a new cloaking technology." Despite, or perhaps because of, their escort he stays in the turret.

Xel'dan goes into the cockpit and looms over Vita's shoulder "I have no knowledge of spacecraft but I assume that they are unknown by your response to them?" then he whispers softly to her ear "I wonder why the Jedi would hold such a secret from us, if we are allies would this not be a valuable asset to their war effort?"

### **ganthet** (2008-10-05 02:07:20)

Rohlan follows the orders, and follows the fighter in. He is alittle worried about the larger ship because he can't scan it. *"Something for another time he thinks to himself."*. He does like be lead to where he was to go. it ment that he might have to take procaution apon landing. "Caretaker, before and after we set down I want you to keep the scanners active and let me know if anything is in the area and what it is. Send the info to my H.U.D, I want to know if anything might be hostile."

### **ganthet** (2008-10-05 02:23:59)

As Rohlan exits his ship he checks the link between him and Cartaker. He has a field kit on his back, his other gear is either in to ship or on his person. He stands there in front of his ship blaster rifle at the ready. His head moves from side to side checking the area for any place that snipers could operate from, his guard is up and he is ready for anything.

Tagran exits the *Wing* slightly ahead of the others and stops before the welcoming party. To the draethos he might even look like some form of guard as he remains silent and lets someone else do the introductions. He knows his strengths, and representing the GA to a touchy alien race isnâ€™t one of them.

As they land down on Draethos, Devdan powers down his ship and gets out of it. Watching the draethos who approached them, he takes a good look around him, trying to recall anything useful he might have heard about draethos. He straightens out his worn jacket, and checks the blaster at his side, keeping up his apperance of being nothing more than a law enforcement agent - both to the draethos and the others.

"Powering down systems," Vita informed the observers in the cockpit. "Let's hope we don't need to make an expeditious exit." Vita, however, knew that Tooty could power-up the ship if needed. Piloting it was a bit too much for the little droid to handle, however.
Vita was last to exit her ship, as she decided a change of attire was needed. It looked cold with the wind blowing. Her Sullust leather outfit and coat would grant excellent protection from the wind. It's black color a striking contrast to her pale skin and white hair.
<!-- m -->[http://fc73.deviantart.com/fs10/i/2006/ &#8230; arnate.jpg](http://fc73.deviantart.com/fs10/i/2006/078/f/a/Lorne_Mavron_by_Kharnate.jpg "http://fc73.deviantart.com/fs10/i/2006/078/f/a/Lorne_Mavron_by_Kharnate.jpg")<!-- m -->
As she exited down the ramp, she turned to see Tooty following her. "I said no, you're not coming." She walked up and knelt down to her little friend. "I need you on board in case something happens. I'll keep in touch with my comm." RQ-2T gave a little disheartening whistle, a satisfied beeped, then rolled back up the ramp into the ship. Vita continued toward the group of Draethos. With a slight, polite bow Vita explained what she knew. "Greetings, I apologize for our intrusion, and thank you for your cooperation. The Jedi Council has sent us here to investigate a great threat to the galaxy. They believe it to be hidden, nearby. Any assistance you can offer, would be greatly appreciated."

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-05 11:54:08)

"A Sith threat." She answered dryly. "We were shown evidence of their leader's strength, then told to begin our search here, on your home."
Vita paused for a moment of contemplation. "I don't understand it all yet myself, sir. I'm sure the Jedi Council didn't mean to imply anyone from this world was associated, but, is it possible they've hidden themselves here? Has anything out of place happened, I mean of course, before we arrived?"

He looks back at all of you "I apologize, I must go ahead and check on something"

### **Parmenter** (2008-10-05 13:29:12)

Disturbing was this news of discrepancies in their story. It left Vita unsure of how to proceed. She nodded in understanding, at Mal-to's words. Then asked as he departed, "What shall we do until you return?" It was obvious his people didn't want them here, and without his supervision, what would stop them from acting on it.

To the Greeters, Vita concluded, "We shall retire to our ships until Mal-to returns. I hope that is not an inconvenience for you."
Devdan received a smile and nod from Vita. There was plenty of room on board her ship after all. She led a group back into her ship to the lounge. Once there she opened a secure channel to the others. "So what now?"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-05 14:08:23)

Sitting on a chair, spinning his blaster on the table in front of him, Devdan looked at Vita.
"We wait for a little while and then we get out of here of course. I for one am pretty curious about whatÂ´s really going on here"

### **Valheru** (2008-10-05 14:29:36)

Tagran files back into the *Wing* along with the others. The mando sits down in the lounge area, refusing to let his frustration show. He responds to Vita over the com, "Obviously they'll be watching us, the question is how well. Perhaps someone with stealth training could distract our 'hosts' while the rest of us slip out. After we're away they'd hopefully be able to make their own escape."

Rohlan goes back into his ship. "Caretaker keep scanning the area I want a layout if you can get it let me know when it is ready."

He opens a secure comm signal to Tag. In Mando[hide]*"How are we going to sneak out of here Ner'vod?

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-05 15:15:29)

time winds on.......
YOur ships recieve a message
You hear Mal-to speak "The sith are here! in the caves, I'm surrounded! YOu must be careful, they have taken the draethos hostage, and sith troopers roam the caves!"

---

### **Thraken** (2008-10-05 15:21:02)

Tafo was ushered out of the ship and subsequently filed back in again. *Things didn't go to hell like I expected but this is subtler than I thought.*
To those assembled he says "I spoke with Mal-to on the way here. As you may have gathered he was specifically told that the Sith had been here. Given our mission the best course is to gain hard data on where exactly the sith come from. Records, travel information, hyper coordinates or the like. Failing that I suppose it's whatever we can get." Pacing back and forth he continues.
"How exactly seems difficult. Draethos are telepathic and apparently have good eyes. Mal-to's run off to cause some sort of distraction, but that alone may not be enough." His mind rattles on, thinking about the situation before stopping and closing his eyes for a moment.
He's suddenly jolted out of that as the message comes through. *Ah. Poodoo applied to fan now*. He closes his eyes again.

Devdan straightens a bit as the message comes through. He stands up and holsters his gun.
"Well, that does it for me. IÂ´m going out to have a look"
He looks over at Vita.
"Does this ship have somplace where you can slip out without having to open the hatch and tell everyone watching you are going for a walk?"
((Devdan would actively oppose any Use the Force check made to Sense Force, Use the Force +11))

### **Thraken** (2008-10-05 15:39:30)

Seeing the Knight move decisively he decides to follow. "No point in staying in here then. So what now? Save our guide and liberate for ourselves the local warriors?".
Tafo's cloak appears to widen slightly, his hands on his hips - or rather one hand on the grip of his blaster.
((Note: I guess Tafo would UtF and clear mind to avoid hostile detection also.))

### **Parmenter** (2008-10-05 15:58:03)

"There's the Cargo Drop doors, in the forward bay." She explained. "I could open it up enough for us to drop out." Sensing her companion's confusion to the explanation she continued. "They're used to drop cargo off large items using the cargo bay's crane, and also for possibly docking an airspeeder. Anyway, they'll drop us right under the ship, concealing us with the landing gear a bit."

---

### **ganthet** (2008-10-05 16:04:33)

Apon hearing the call form the Jedi, Rohlan grabs his pack and blaster rifle and heads out of the ship. Switching on his comm link "Caretaker close up the ship. Do not open up untill you hear from me." Rohlan heads for the cave enterance. He stops on the left side of the mouth of the cave and checks a head and left and right. Blaster rifle at the ready. Switching on his commlnk. "Tag! Get your *shebs* out here! The *jetti* has step in *osik* up to his neck! Shift it *ner'vod*!" Leaving the commlink open Rohlan proceeds into the cave.
((OCC: Preception +6 to see if there is anything waiting for me.))

Rohlan doesn't see anyone alive.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-05 16:15:44)

"ThatÂ´s good enough for me. Would you be so kind as to open it up?"
He starts to head for the forward bay, but then turns around and looks at the others.
"Give me a few seconds before you follow, will you?"
Once again smiling, he sets of, and as the doors opens, slips out and hides under the ship, seeking for his next reasonable goal.

You don't see anyone, though you see the bodies of the greeters, gaping wounds in their torsos. You do however use the ships as cover, and sneak closer to the caves, but there is a open space between you and the caves.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-05 16:32:00)

As he sneaks out, Devdan watches the slaughtered bodies, casting a quick glance at their wounds. He reaches the ends of their line of ships, and he can see the caves that Mal-To went into. There is an uncomfortable open area between him and their entrance.
*Someone is likely to be watching…*
Looking back to see if the others are coming, Devdan turns his eyes back towards the caves, and reaches out with the Force, trying to find Mal-To.
((Use the Force +11 to activate Farseeing to find Mal-To. Also, I will try to dientify if any of the bodies I spot seems to have lightsaber wounds.
For the record, Devdan always uses his Force Powers with discretion, and if someone who doesnÂ´t know him to be a Force User or Jedi would possibly be able to see him, he will use Deception or whatever skill necessary to hide his powers))

Vita liked Xel'dan's plan, however, he looked too dangerous for it to work properly. Instead of arguing, she made a snap decision and slid down the cargo drop doors. Using the darkness under the ships she got as close as she could to the cave. "Be ready to save me, she said into the comm on her wrist." Grabbing her lightsaber, she ignited it and began running across the open ground.

Watching from the landing gear with blaster drawn he nods satisfied as everyone exits their ships, he nods satisfied. *We have one leading, Xel'dan is with Vita and Mandos, one more with the last group. Good spread overall. Now for random one.*
With the apparent lack of threat on the way to the cave entrance, Tafo races forth to along with the crew of the Freedom's Wing following the lead group of armored men and Vita ahead the distance.

Waiting for the others to come , Devdan walks into the caves, drawing his blaster in the process. As they walks deeper into the caves, he keeps to the rear, watching behind the group.
When they reaches the place where the road forks, his natural instincts tells him to split up, but as one of the mandalorians seems to have a lead on the location of Mal-To, he decides to stick with them instead. He keeps in the middle of the group, walking with the jedi, using the light from their sabers to help him see. Keeping his blaster on stun, he walks acutiously ahead.

In the cave EXO moves in front of Alex to provide her with cover. He knows Alex can handle herself but he still feels protective of his Captain. He unlocks his blaster arm from its housing on his back and brings his heavy blaster rifle online. The mounting will keep the weapon stable if he has to lay down suppression fire or shooting on the move. He scans the area for viable targets.

Vita fell in behind Xel'dan. Given their brief spar the other day, she'd begun to trust him and his advice was well received. Extinguishing her blade she instead let her eyes adjust to the low lighting provided by the others. "This is not a place for me," she said softly to herself.

Suddenly soldiers burst into view but Tag remains calm. His blasters appear in his hand so quickly its as if they'd always been there and he unleashes a barrage of shots at the enemy. He feels himself grinning, "Oya! The *utreekove* are about to find out they've bitten off more than they can chew."

As a powerful explosion erupts behind them and seals of that way, Devdan starts to get a really bad feeling about this. It comes to no real ruprise to him when they are surrounded by soldiers, and he shifts his focus behind the group, raising his blaster and sending a stun blast towards the closest enemy.

The explosion had blocked off any escape, and left Vita in despair. "I deal with people! Not caves!" She said, just as Xel'dan proceeded forward. As the echo of her words faded, soldiers appeared almost as if from nowhere. Not much of a surprise after the explosion, but still enough to cause her to jump and ignite her saber. Things were getting messy, just the way Vita didn't like it.
She was used to dealing with adversaries carrying a variety of weapons, but she was also used to dealing with them alone. Zigging her way between her fellow agents, she approached one of the soldiers, lightsaber trailing her like a stiff tail. Swinging her arm she brought the saber from behind her to the front, slicing at the soldier with a sideways attack.

With their escape now blocked the group determinedly continued forward even more cautiously. "One thing's for sure. This isn't going to end nicely." When the lead elements of the group came face to face with armored warriors Alex knew it had hit the turbofan. As the fight broke out she sought cover and looked for someone to blast. "Take cover!" She wasn't a hand-to-hand specialist. Her preferred method was at range.

Vita stared down her opponent, as they fought with weapons locked. Like Xen'dal had said, it would be very close quarters, none of her usual movements. As they stood there, her lightsaber lighting the small distance between them, blaster bolts came from both sides, nearly hitting him, almost hitting her. Her eyes followed the path of the bolt that came close, her gaze ended at another soldier.
Looking into the helmet of her opponent she said, "He will die right after you."

Tafo's shot barely clips the trooper, and deals 12 damage
the remaining sith all act.
Sith #1 (who is to the left of you all) fires at miles, but his shot misses
Sith #2 (in front of Xel'dan) manages to weave his blade past Xel'dan's defence, and strike his armor, dealing 11 damage.
Sith #5 (in front of the group and to the right) fires at Tagran, but the shot harmlessly passes by
Sith #6 (way more to the right of #5) aims at Xel'dan, but you spin past his shot

Alex zeros in on sith that EXO fired on. Her thought is that the combined fire will wear down the armored trooper.
OOC:

Standard to attack
With aim and point blank range Alex is +11 to hit and 3d8+10 for damage. (She also has precise shot if firing into a melee.)

OOC: If #5 and #2 are still up I'll shoot at them, otherwise #6 (obviously). Since this is likely the last round of combat I'll go ahead and use the Hair Trigger mod on my pistols to reroll the damage and take the better result (unless the first roll is so good there's little point in rerolling).
Full round action: Rapid Shot with both pistols, +11 to hit, 4d8+4 damage, PBS not inculded

Vita surveyed the fight finishing up around her. The bodies of Sith soldiers lay strewn about the cavern, some stunned, some dead. Deactivating her blade she approached one of the stunned soldiers(Sith #1).
OOC: Just some filler till the fights over. So her round is spent just moving over to that soldier.

Xel&#39;dan switches his lightsaber off but keeps it steady in his hand, looking to see who is still alive he looks for Vita and sees her heading for one of the Sith Bodies and heads over to her "Bind him and begin the interrogation, though he will not easily give us the information...." Xel'dan puts his boot on the stunned Sith Soldier's neck, ready to crush his throat if need be...
Looking at Vita "Are you alright?" Xel'dan then looks around at the others "I must admit, we may actually live long enough to face the Sith Lord, before we possibly die by his hands...."

### **Valheru** (2008-10-16 23:59:45)

Tagran checks the power levels before holstering his pistols. He smirks at Xel'dan's comment, the grim humor appeals to Mandalorian sensibilities. Tag starts looking over the bodies and checking if any of them are still alive (besides the one Xel and Vita are at of course).
OOC: If they have comlinks can we see what frequency they're using and try to listen in?

---

you need a use computer check and a mechanics check to operate the thing (considering it would be without the suit)

Tag tosses Xel'dan a roll of mesh tape, "Then do so." He goes back to examining the troopers (*are* any of the others still alive?) and their comlinks.

Rohlan looks over the dead soldiers laying around and slings his blaster rifle. Bending down he takes one of the helmets off of one of the fallen.

He looks over the helment and trys to see if he can get the comm gear to work.

what I meant is, because the helmet is designed to work with the armor, you need a mechanics check to operate it.
(of course, once you post your modifiers (and someone says they're going to make a use comp check, and posts modifiers) I'll make the checks)

Holstering his gun, Devdan moves over to Vita and XelÂ´dan to check on the stunned trooper. At XelÂ´dans mention of actually surviving to see the sith lord, he answers in a calm manner.
"Well, I donÂ´t plan to die just yet, so weÂ´ll probably have to kick his ass"

Tafo holsters his slim and comparatively small blaster pistol with some frustration. *That's what happens when I haven't been to a range in years. And this is a gun for peacetime, not a battle. Maybe I should have just diced them with my lightsaber.*
Looking around he sees the men in armour checking the bodies and he moves to follow suit. *Let's see if I can get anything useful.*
He addresses the group
"You should probably head out to get Mal-to. I'll be checking out these people."
*Perception +11, begin searching the trooper bodies for anything that may hold useful information (e.g. com units, memory chips, datapads, recorders etc.). Secondary priority - a good blaster rifle (Tafo would go for one with retractable stock) and powerpacks*

Someone has thrown a huge hydrospanner into the works. Do you guys know someone by the name of Draethos?" Rohlan trys to link the comm gear in the sith helment to his H.U.D to see if he can get a fix on where the transmission was coming from.

Alex looks at EXO as he corrects Rohlan and starts to chuckle as she comes up next to her co-pilot. "Did you have some humor programming uploaded before we began this mission?" Keeping her blaster out she looks around and agrees with Xel'dan. "He's right me need to meet up with Mal-to. Eventually they will get enough troopers to him and bottle him up somewhere."

"Im sorry Mistress. I was not trying to be humorous, I was mearly trying to inform the mandalorian of his current location in the galaxy. If he would like I can replay the entire briefing for him."

"Well whoever or whatever he or she is they seem to be causing some mistif for the Sith and that I plan to use to our advantage." Rohlan keep working on hooking the comm device into his hud to figure out which direction they need to go. "Is our friend here being talkive or do we need to persaued him to be more coopertive?"

Looking for a more suitable weapon - there wasn't much choice really. Some were blasted to pieces, some were sliced in half. From the trooper that Tagran dropped with a double headshot he picked up a blaster rifle. After running through the standard weapons check he learned back in the fleet he put the safety on and hung the weapon on his belt via a protruding section of the retracted stock.
With this done, he searches the bodies in more detail for anything useful

Slapping his face, she hollered at the trooper. "Get up now, Soldier."

"Yes, struggle, tire yourself." Vita egged him on. "I need you to tell me what you know. Who's in charge, why you're here, what you're after?" She slapped him again. Looking at the others present, she said, "Look and see if any of the others are alive, I don't think this one looks like he'll be of much use. But he might help me in persuading any others."

Walking among the other troopers, Devdan finds one that indeed appears to be alive as well. Drawing his blaster, he kicks the lying trooper in the side to wake him up, then kneels next to him, putting the point of his blaster in the mans side.

Tagran deftly catches the mesh tape and goes to bind the other captive. Once finished he stands up and begins slowly heading down the tunnel. "The rest of us should get going while you conduct the interrogation. Comm us if you find out anything useful."

"Sith apprentice?" She repeated, skeptical. "He, is none of your concern, I am." She says, looking him in the face. "You tried to kill me, and my associates, you're lucky I talked the armored ones out of killing you. They're a mean lot."
Vita walks over to the other bound trooper and drags him to the wall opposite the first. "'ello there, number two. Hmm, you don't look like you know much either. But still, maybe you can elaborate on what number one already told me. He said, that some sith apprentice would kill me. So, if I were to ask you, where would I find this sith apprentice, your response would be...what?"

"Well, then." She answers. "I hope for your sake he finds the two of you first. The Draethos don't like uninvited guests, and I'm sure they'll be upset to see the two of you here." With a quick motion she drew her blaster. Flicking it to stun, she shot the two prisoners. "Boring conversation anyway." She said to herself as she turned to leave. To the others present, she said, "We should hurry and join the others. That apprentice might be as dangerous as they say."

Tafo was finishing up his fruitless search of the partially burnt troopers as he troopers rather unfriendly snarl
"the sith apprentice will kill you once you meet him." A body slumps onto the ground from Tafo's hands as he pauses to think for a moment.
*Great. Sith. If he's a dark jedi that wouldn't be too bad, but any Sith is very bad. Records have always shown that whenever Sith are involved Jedi die.* He turns to regard the group sidelong as hear the trooper deliver a line he's heard in many horror holos he's seen before. *If he's a jedi killer type like usual then all that lot will be fine pumping him full of blaster bolts at least.* He pushes back his cloak, unhooks the blaster rifle weighing down the back of his belt and extends the stock. While adjusting the sights Vita calls to move on.
"Perhaps, but with a Jedi Knight, a bunch of Mandalorians, extras with blasters and-" he looks to Xel'dan back to Vita "guys and ladies with laser swords, I think any one apprentice might feel worried." *maybe.* He didn't add.
"Well. Onward then." He turns his blaster rifle, settling well into his hands and flicking off the safety. With one hand he pulls his cloak around himself again, it's dark folds concealing most of him in the gloom.
Ready to roll, he quietly jogs off to catch up with the Mandalorians.

Her aim on on the biggest looking of the bunch, the one that has engaged Tafo.

## What's a group of Draethos called? A Drabble of Draethos?

### **Parmenter** (2008-10-19 22:27:32)

Vita watched the proceedings and the ensuing fire fight between the solitary warrior and her compatriots. It was over before it begun, or so she thought until those he was talking to made their appearance. The group was surrounded by angry Draethos, either from what the dead one was saying, or from the act of them killing him. Regardless, it seemed that another fight was called for, a fight which Vita would like to avoid at all costs.
The group was not here to kill Draethos, they were here to assess the Sith threat, and deal with it. Still, they could not do their task if they were to be attacked like this. Vita drew and ignited her saber. Still, she tried to appeal to them. "Stop this, we're here to help, Mal-to will explain it all."

((OCC one step back out of melee and fire at the target in front of me. Att. +13 (12 + 1 for point blank shot.) damage 3d8 +6.))

EXO lets out a stream of click and clacks.
[hide]"We are enemies of the Sith, we were invited here by Mal-to."[/hide]
He switches his weapon to stun and does not attack.
"We can easily defeat them but it wouldn't prove a useful coarse of action, remember there are hostages in these caves and these might be them."
*Swift action: switch to stun
Standard action: inspire confidence +1 attack +1 skills

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-20 19:09:14)

Exo inspires everyone, granting all allies a +1 to skill checks and attack rolls. The draethos understand you, but do not hesitate. (by the way, it only takes a free action or two to say all that)
Tagran shots into the mob, felling a few warriors with his shots.
Xel'dancharges into the mob that attacked Rohlan, cutting through two warriors with one mighty slash
Devdan doesn't really sense any mind controlling influence
Rohlan withdraws, moving a meter diagonally behind Xel'dan, and shots into the mob, killing a draethos. most of the draethos are dead, but several still stand.

### **ganthet** (2008-10-20 21:40:26)

"This is no challange for a warrior. The enemy falls like wheat to the blade." Rohlan switches his weapon to Autofire and sprays the area the enemy is in with blaster fire. "Let us end this quickly our true prey awaits." Rohlan is not boasting, the sith where more of a challange then these creatures where.
((OCC: Swift to switch to autofire. Att +12 minus Autofire. Will use controlled burst talent to reduce the penalty by 2. damage 3d8+6.))

### **Valheru** (2008-10-21 03:21:25)

Tag nods to Rohlan, "Agreed." He continues to fire on the draethos.

### **Thraken** (2008-10-21 08:01:18)

"gah!"
Dodging several strikes he lost his balance, potentially fatal in a fight. Not having time to switch blaster settings, he jammed the butt of his rifle into his shoulder and blazed away at his remaining attackers.
((2 swift: Brace. standard: Autofire attack +10 3d8+4 stun -I assume PBshot and inspire cancelled out by braced autofire penalty))

*Hmm…they donÂ´t seem to be under any form of mind control…but there are more ways to influence someone*
Seeing the warriors in front of him open wild fire againt their attackers he almost cried out that they would need one alive, but he changed his mind, and brought his gun to bear on one of the attackers coming from a different direction, hoping to lower him with a single shot.
((+8 attack, 4d6+4 Stun Damage, PBS not included))

Miles (roleplaying btw) picks up a draethos and throws it into the crowds, knocking out several draethos. only the elite group of draethos remain.
Tafo releases a flurry of shots, hitting many draethos, dealing 16 points of stun damage.
The remaining draethos turn and run from you.
All of you hear the sound of a bowcaster being fired, and Mal-to walks up behind you all.
He has a very surprised expression on his face and he asks "what are you all doing here? why aren't you in the city?"

---

### **Valheru** (2008-10-21 21:58:43)

Tag watches the draethos depart, making sure they really are fleeing. Once satisfied he turns to Mal-to, "We got your transmission. You said the *darjetii* were in the caves, therefore we entered the caves. Why would we be in the city?". His tone isn't sarcastic, he's legitimately confused.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-21 22:02:24)

Mal-to looks confused "Transmission? what transmission? I sent nothing to you"
He sees on the ground many dead draethos "What is this? Did they attack you?"

---

### **Valheru** (2008-10-21 22:37:53)

Tag looks at the bodies, "Yes, I'm not sure why. We tried to communicate with them, but they were...persistent."
Tag replays the transmission for Mal-to. "Apparently someone wants us in here; so I ask again, why did you expect us to be in the city?"

---

### **Yogi** (2008-10-21 23:18:36)

Something wasn't right. Mal-to expected them to be in the city not here in the caves. Someone had deceived them. Were they being played the fools here? She listens to the conversation trying to gain any insight on what is really happening here.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-21 23:26:11)

Mal-to looks worried as he comtemplates this "hmm, then follow me, we must make our way back to the city, and talk to the council in charge"

"I don't like being made a *di'kut jetti'*" Looking at the new comer. "Someone will die for this, good warriors have fallen for no reason. Someone is going to wish they had never been born." Rohlan keeps his blaster rifle at the ready and follows the rest of the party. Pulling out his portable scanner and try to scan head for any on comming life forms.
(( Use computer +11 to use the portable scanner.))

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-22 01:07:59)

You don't sense any lifeforms other than the draethos fleeing from you.
Mal-to shakes his head at you "No time for scans ramikade, we need to get moving"

---

### **ganthet** (2008-10-22 01:28:40)

After finding nothing on the scanner but the people he was with and the fleeing enemy. Rohlan puts away his scanner and follows Mal-to back to the city. On his commlink to Tag. "This mission has been *shabla* from the beging. *Ni hukaatii'ni shebs ti kama Ner'vod.*"
[hide]I am watching my back bother.[/hide]

### **Valheru** (2008-10-22 03:18:47)

Tag indicates that Mal-to should take the lead. Following him Tag responds to Rohlan over their helmet comms, "*â€˜Lek, niâ€™gana dush bâ€™aal*."
[hide]"Yeah, I have a bad feeling (about this)." I don't think the (about this) is needed in Mando'a, is it? Just thought I'd try my hand at translating the classic Star Wars phrase. :P[/hide]

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-22 04:51:28)

Holstering his gun again, Devdan looks with skepticism on Mal-To.
"You think we should go back to the city? To talk to the council? After they denied the existance of a sith threat, that we now have confirmed exists. Not to mention that we were just attacked by a bunch of your people. I donÂ´t know about the rest of you, but it seems like a really bad idea to me"
((Sense Influence +11 on Mal-To, and after that a Search your Feelings +11 to determine if going back seems to be a good idea))

### **Frost** (2008-10-22 10:11:05)

EXO watches the mando's with interest listening in on thier comlinks. He rotates his head a full 180 degrees in an attempt to watch his own back as well. He walks over to Alex *(with his head still backwards)* and says on a very low volume *(whisper mode for droids)*
"He seems very eager to have us leave these caves. How did he enter since the entrance was blown shut behind us."

---

### **Yogi** (2008-10-22 13:28:15)

Alex understood what EXO was talking about. Something didn't seem right. Keeping her voice low she answered him. "I don't know maybe he entered before we did. Remember the sith comms there was a Dreathos down here causing some trouble. Maybe it was him ."

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-22 20:45:30)

Xel'dan follows behind the others, he feels that they have been deceived by Mal-to and the Sith into a trap, he keep his sense attuned to sense if someone should happen to come from behind them...
"I may not know how my companions feel about this situation Mal-to, but I will tell you that I do not trust you nor anyone else allied with you at this time...." Xel'dan speaks sternly "..but I feel the Sith are a greater threat so I will aid you until whatever deception we are being led to leads us to our betrayer, be it you or another." Xel'dan keeps his hand on his lightsaber as he walks along behind the others...

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-23 00:00:14)

"very well" and mal-to walks into a tunnel
you all follow him, cautious and on guard but nothing bad happens.
you eventually see light at the end of the tunnel, and walk outside into the light. In front of you, you see a city, built into the mountain side.
Mal-to walks up to the guards, and they seem to recognize him, quickly moving out of the way. You all follow him inside. You see durasteel buildings, and worn streets, draethos walk through the streets, all of them carrying on weapon or another. You see very few shops, or recreation of any kind. Mal-to leads you into the largest building, which seems to be the government center. At a large set of double doors inside, Mal-to stops and slowly pushes the doors open, revealing a room with 9 draethos at a table, discussing local politics.
A draethos at the head of the table clears his throat and speaks "Mal-to, what a suprise. What exactly has brought you back here? " he glances at all of you "I see you brought outsiders. I wonder why." he glares at Mal-to suspiciously.
Mal-to regards this statement with contempt "My employer believes the Sith have returned, and that they are here right now, and in fact recruiting native Draethos to serve as shock troops"
Another draethos pipes with his harsh voice "Really? We have not seen any sign of such activity what so ever. Do you have proof?"
Mal-to barely seems to be able to contain his anger, but he refrains from making a loud outburst "very well then. I see we have nothing to discuss."
He ushers you all out of the chamber, closing the door behind him. "I despise such bureaucrats," he snarls.

---

### **ganthet** (2008-10-23 14:12:38)

Rohlan leaves the chamber behind Mal-to. He is starting to think that he was not paid enuff for this mission. "This planet seems to befull enemys." He looks at Mal-to. "You seem to have fallen out of favor with the locals. We do not need there promistion to proceed with our mission to remove the Sith from this planet." Rohlan checks the charge on his blaster rifle and switchs back to single fire. Activates his comm link. "Caretaker, status report."

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-23 18:10:03)

"Nothing to report sir" caretaker promptly responds
"It appears it's time for me to explain why you were brought here in full, at least once we find our ally here." Mal-to then presses a button on his wrist gauntlet and he leads you outside, into the streets, and he leads you through the crowd into an alleyway.
Mal-to quietly says "Jaro, are you here?"
And just as quietly, a Bith materializes right in front of you. Mal-to quickly recognizes him and states "Vigo, what are you doing here? I asked for Jaro"
The bith chuckles "well sorry. Jaro was busy. So I got sent, you got a problem with that?"
Mal-to sighs "no, I suppose not"
Vigo the Bith, with a very bored expression asks "so what do you need? someone disentegrated, town blown up, computer net work hacked and infected with viruses?"
Mal-to shakes his head at this "no no no. I need you to tell Master Qi-Xon everything is proceding as he predicted. It's up to them now" he gestures back to you all "Also, who will be arriving in this system once the signals given?"
"Master Qi-Xon himself actually, with his flagship, and Cylven will also support him with his fleet"
Mal-to sighs, very loud this time "the privateer? why must they send him? oh well, at least he's good at his job. thank you Vigo, that will be all"
and with that, vigo activates an item on his belt and disappears.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Mal-to, seeming satisfied with the exchange, turns to you all "Now, for the reason you were recruited. At first, we were adept at fighting the sith, and finding their hideouts, but now the sith have been very clever. their leader has taken careful steps to keep the sith out of our eyes and ears. That's why we need you all. My mission is to attract their attention, while you all gather the facts. I know the sith are here, but I don't know where, and that's your job, to find out. Do you understand?"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-23 18:46:44)

Shaking his head, Devdan looks at the draethos.
"Yeah, I understand. What I donÂ´t understand is why you dragged us out of those caves. With both a bunch of sith troopers **and** a group of your own people trying to kill us in there, it seems like a good place to look around in"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-23 18:57:18)

"I do not believe so. I think that after you fought those sith troopers, that they had decided their trap had failed, and sent the draethos as fodder, to distract you, while they escaped. Some of the blame lies on me though, the troopers there were not too much of a threat, but a sith in those caves was quite dangerous. I almost detected him too late, and I didn't want to risk your safety afterwards."

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-23 19:28:23)

"Well now, wasnÂ´t your job to attract their attention, and our job to find them? If they had any kind of base there, I doubt they would have been able to clear it out completely between the time we fought the sith troopers and the draethos. There would be some trail left behind, there always is"

"but I did attract their attention, but someone sent you a message saying I needed help, when I did not, and that threw the plan off. And there is little likelihood their is a base in those mountains, it would be too easily found"

### **Valheru** (2008-10-23 21:52:50)

Tagran is beginning to grow frustrated with this mission, intrigue isn't exactly his specialty. Keeping the exasperation out of his voice he asks, "Very well. What's the next step?".

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-23 21:56:30)

"you gather information, I'd start by searching the city, for suspicious things that may relate to the sith. While you all do that, I'm going to conduct my own investigation, to keep the sith and their alllies occupied.

---

### **Yogi** (2008-10-24 12:32:50)

Alex looked at the others as Mal-to spoke of them going into the city and looking for "suspicious things" that may relate to the sith. What bothered her was that they were outsiders here on the Draethos home world. How would they know what was suspicious or not. And where would they even begin to look. She was beginning to feel that she should have taken that lucrative job of smuggling weapons to the rebels on the backwater planet then this one.
She looked at Mal-to. "No offense but where are we to look? Anything could be Sith related. This is your planet. We're the outsiders here. I would think you would know better than us what would seem out of place." The frustration was a bit apparent on her face.

---

### **Frost** (2008-10-24 13:03:17)

Having turned his head back around to front He listens to Mal-to's direction about looking for suspicious sith activity. He doesn't have a lot of data about the Sith or thier culture so he decides to extrapolate from what he does know. Sith are similar is abilities to Jedi but differ drastically in philosophy. They share a taste for hand to hand combat over the expedience of a blaster. They can perform beyond normal species standards as far as abilities go. They also carry lightsabers usually red in color. They tend to be very emotional compared to the stoic Jedi. He starts working on his profile so far he has emotional lightsaber wielding maniacs who can move things with thier mind, shoot lighting from their hands and deflect blasters with thier lightsticks. So he starts scanning the area for people who might match this profile.

anyways
"look for suspicious conversations, as bureaucrats here often speak basic, so the local's don't understand them. Also, you may see suspicious activities at gladitorial fights, or simple brawls in general. Now, good luck, and be careful" with that, mal-to walks off

---

### **Valheru** (2008-10-24 22:26:24)

Checking out gladiatorial fights sounds *much* more interesting than eavesdropping on a bunch of bureaucrats to a Mandalorian. "I think I'll make my way to the arena and see what I can find out."

---

### **Frost** (2008-10-24 23:00:28)

EXO fails to find any emtionally disturbed anti-jedi so he has a new plan.
"Mistress I would remind you that I am a protocol style droid I could move relativly unnoticed amongst bureaucrats. No one ever suspects a droid. We should also try to find a hotel or something in the area to at least use as a base of operations and a place to recharge."

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-24 23:14:08)

"These gladiatorial fights would be a place for a Sith to find a weapon he could use against his enemies, even more so when he uses one of their own weapons against them...." Xel'dan refers to the gladiatorial fighters as weapons, as the race of people he has met here are no more then simple weapons either striking themselves or other with no truth to be found other then the art of war.
"I will accompany you mandolorian, I feel we may find more truth there then amongst those of wicked tongues and followers of greed..."

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-25 05:32:01)

"You go and check out those places, IÂ´ll take a sweep though the city and check out the local cantinas, gambling dens, and similar places"
He smiles at the others.
"We all have our specialities. Anyway, I think it would be a good idea to find some place to use as an operational base. However, I wouldnÂ´t really suggest we leaves our ships alone, so why donÂ´t we stay in them?"

---

### **Yogi** (2008-10-25 16:50:48)

Alex looks at Dev when he suggests the cantinas and gambling dens. "I may go with you." She looks back to Exo. "Government offices may also be a good idea. People always talk around droids without thinking about it." She thinks about it for a moment as both held possibilities. "Ok, Exo and I will go to the government offices area. There We can poke around as traders looking to set up shop. We'll be back at the ship at 20:00 hours standard." She finally holstered her blaster and glanced at Exo. "Shall we go?"

### **Parmenter** (2008-10-25 23:37:57)

Vita followed the group closely, listening to all that was said, and even some things that weren't. She recognized Mal-to's contempt for those in power, she knew the feeling well. Other than Lord Grakis, she had the feeling for the other members of the Arkanian Conglomerate. They fought over pointless issues, with useless tactics. 'Change comes by the edge of the blade.' A sentiment she imagined Mal-to would agree with.
The group discussed disbanding, looking into several leads of inquiry. Vita falls in with Devdan. She felt it unwise for any of them to be by themselves. Not while on this planet that abhors outsiders. Also, cantinas and gambling dens, if there were any, sounded like a good place to start. They usually had people who could be persuaded to give information in a number of ways.
OOC: Sorry I've been absent, will try to keep up.

Tagran nods to Xel'dan and the two depart for the coliseum without another word. Outwardly Tag remains aloof from the draethos' stares but he's actually paying close attention in case any of them are looking for trouble. (OOC: Gotta love the 360 degree HUD 8) )

Tagran and Xel'dan march confidentally to the colloseum and enter inside. You see a large crowd of draethos cheering on the fight between two heavily armored draethos, fighting with melee weapons. As you watch the spectacle, another Draethos walks up to you and says in basic "Human, are you two the next gladiatorial fighters?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-26 20:43:28)

Xel'dan looks at the Draethos "What is there to gain from participating in your gladiatorial fights and should we were to enter it would be as a team, if possible?" Xel'dan looks Tagran "I would surmise that you would have no problem with us joining forces would you?"
Xel'dan awaits his answer/s and looks around the area for any possible Sith
*Perception +11(+2 when Helmet is on)*

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-26 23:09:07)

you see nothing resembling a sith in the crowd, though it is very difficult to search properly
THe draethos answers "ah, yes, if you can win, you'll get some credits as a reward. And yes, you can enter as a team, just means you'll face a team"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devdan and Vita enter inside the cantina. From a glance, it seemed a very desolate building, but in reality was packed with Draethos. Devdan and Vita sit at the counter and get a curious glance from the bartender. He gruffly asks "don't see many human's here. what's your order?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exo and Alex find that without Mal-to around, the guards seem very strict and unwilling to let non-government agents and officials inside. However, when as they were restricted entry, the two of you here a whisper from two draethos going inside the building, with one saying to the other "when are the weapons coming in? they said they'd arrive today"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-27 07:06:35)

"Well, from what IÂ´ve seen so far, local manners might be the reason for the low tourism. IÂ´ll have some juma juice"
Looking around, he discreetly reaches out with his senses, seeking for others sensitive to the Force. With one ear out there, listening after anything that could be related to the Sith (he knows the Sith language), he turned to Vita.
"So, where are you from?"

---

### **Thraken** (2008-10-27 08:48:24)

Tafo follows the visit to the leaders in silence, once again folding his rifle and hooking it off the back of his belt. All the way his mind turns blank and along with his silent walk he effectively drops from the perception of the others.
Following the unproductive meeting and Mal-to's instructions he ponders the two as Devdan mentions wandering off to find a cantina. Tafo had never really been part of the transient cantina population and felt a worrying blank in his knowledge of such an environment. *Probably because I was always dragged around by a drunken bunch whenever I was on shoreleave.* He also found the idea of combat as entertainment for the masses distasteful, and so his choice was made by elimination.
As everyone seperates in four different directions, Tafo takes the opportunity to smoothly walk through a small alleyway and pulls up the hood of his cloak, normally appearing as a large collar. Pulling his hands in, the cloak concealed his appearance. Coming out of the alleyway he finds himself as planned, on the trail of the light freighter crew.
leisurely following behind them, he clears his mind again and opens up to world around.
===========================================================
While Alex and Exo attempts to gain entry at the front doors, Tafo keeps his distance and looks around for a likely courtyard, park or diner where local workers would rest.

At the cantina.....
The bartender rolls his eyes at you, and get's you your drink. You do not sense any force users (other than the ones in your group). and the only thing you hear around you are the harsh clicks and grunts of the draethos language.

ooc: true, you have a excuse thraken
Tafo sees a warehouse where workers are entering, and notices a well (well for draethos at least) dressed aristocrat enter inside

You stumble across information about laws, finding out that bureaucrats have complete control. and from their list of accomplishments (or lack of) you can see that they are very self serving.

### **Valheru** (2008-10-27 20:07:26)

Tagran is intrigued by the idea of joining the gladiatorial games...perhaps they could draw the Sitto them. He nods to Xel'dan, "That would be acceptable." Glancing at the draethos he asks, "What's the format?"

### **Thraken** (2008-10-27 21:57:37)

After some idle wandering his attention is drawn to a relative shock of colour. Not deviating from his aimless wandering he sees a Draethos wearing clothes with slightly more colour and much more refined in appearance than the workers who surround him.
Seeing them enter a warehouse he gradually alters his course towards the side of the warehouse. *A VIP visit to a warehouse means there's something he wants to see. For all I know he's just there to check a long awaited shipment of garden ornamentation, but there doesn't seem to be anything else worth looking at for now.*

OOC: Taking for granted that EXO let Alex in on what he found out.
IC:
Alex listened to what EXO had found out about the government around here. "Makes sense for what's going on. The more the government looks to itself the easier someone can come in and set up shop without them knowing." She looked around for a second. "Or they know the Sith are here and they don't care or they are helping them."
She thought about the self serving bureaucrats and how to get the interest of one of them. "EXO bring up a list of the government officials and run a check on them of questionable activities. Maybe we could entice one of them with some more under the table activities."

EXO keeps up the appearance of a mere protocol droid. He does the search as requested

### **Valheru** (2008-10-28 15:17:23)

As they walk to the waiting area Tag thinks to himself, *'Melee only…now I really wish I'd bought those crushguants'*. He observes the other fighters trying to get a feel for how skilled they are. OOC: I dunno if there's any mechanics for that (but my Perception is +12), if not it's just fluff. Also, could we tell if these fights are to the death from what we saw?

---

### **Thraken** (2008-10-28 16:26:57)

With his likely opposition checked, he moves on sweeping the building to for any windows or doors to get a look at what's happening inside. And hopes he doesn't get an eyeful of any disturbing local customs...

"The same," Vita answered. She wasn't really interested in anything, but felt there would be trouble if she didn't order something. She found her self trying to read the Draethos themselves. She had no clue as to what they were saying, but she tried to fill in the details as best she could using body language and the tone of the clicks.
> &quot;So, where are you from?&quot;

"Arkania, though now, I travel all over taking care of business problems. The reason why I think I'm here."

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-28 19:10:49)

Exo does as Alex says and finds a few officials that have engaged in smuggling, stealing, and etc. Balfon, Olfdan, and Etrick. (all male)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Valheru notes that most of the combatents are not as skilled, though he notices some warriors that seem a legitimate threat.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Tafo finds no windows, though he finds a door, and sneaks inside. Hiding in the shadows, he remains undetected. He overhears a draethos speaking "why are we speaking in basic?" one says, and the colorful bureaucrat responds "because few draethos will understand us. Anyways, do you have the ordered supplies?".
"Yes, I've got them"
"good"
--------------------------------------------------------------------
At the cantina.....
Vita does notice that the draethos seem friendlier here, though that may be the drinks.....

Rohlan wonders along the streets around the cantiana try to get an idea of where he is going to do the most good. He checks out a few shops and and the cantiana that one of his associates went into. Checking with Tag to see if he has found something to keep himself entertained. "*Ner'vode,* you find anything interesting where you are at?" As he waits for Tag's replay, he continues to move around the street checking things out.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-29 14:14:56)

"Business problems huh? What kind of businesses?"
Drinking his juice, Devdan continues to watch the draethos around him, simply keeping up a calm face. Reaching put through the Force, he searches for the mind of the Sith Trooper that they questioned, trying to find some clue to the Sith whereabouts.
((Farseeing +11, if successful and he isnÂ´t lying dead somewhere or otherwise somewhere that seems completely uninteresting IÂ´ll spend a Force Point to increase the effect of Farseeing))

### **Valheru** (2008-10-29 15:55:07)

Tag responds to Rohlan, "*Elek*, the *beskar'jetii* and I are at the coliseum. We're waiting to join in on the next match, figured we might draw some attention this way. I don't know if there's a three person event, but if you're not busy make your way here. I'd like to have you watching our *shebs, ret'lini*.

The draethos seem to ignore you, and a few give you quite angry glares. You do notice however that the guards in front of the government building are gone, possibly on a break.

You both walk into the government building, keeping a close eye out for guards and suspicious actitivy. As you walk down the hall, you notice a lone door on the right side, you try to open it, but it's locked.

### **Thraken** (2008-10-30 19:11:46)

*Interesting. But still not linked to what I'm looking for. I need to see what they're passing around. But relevant or not, this seems to be the kind of thing they may shoot me for.*
Telon looks to the force for guidance, before moving to a better vantage point.

You feel that you will find some answers, so you take a look around the corner.
you see one of the draethos holding a blaster rifle, and showing it to the colorful bureaucrat. you as well see what look like war droids in a crate behind him.

### **Yogi** (2008-11-01 09:04:50)

Alex looks at the door that stands locked in front of them. *Well we cold try and bypass it. But how much trouble would that cause?* She looks to EXO. "Well should we even attempt it. I'd really hate to see what a Dreathos prison looks like." She said with a smile.

Xel'dan checks his armor over to make sure it is functional then looks at his comrade the Mado Tag "I think we are going to be publicly executed here, as I find it unsettling they did not ask us the weapons we will be using and they have not asked you to disarm yourself of your Firearms...."

the lock looks complex to you. You do think you can unlock it, but there's a good chance you'll fail.

---

### **Yogi** (2008-11-01 20:24:14)

Looking at the lock Alex see that it's a complicated one. Knowing that she was a bit better when it came to tinkering she spoke up. "Want me to do it? Maybe you have some schematics in that droid brain you have and can point out a few things for me."
OOC: Mechanics +17 and maybe an assist from EXO for +2 more I think.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-01 20:28:40)

Alex spends some time unlocking the lock, and with some help with Exo, manages to open the lock. Inside you see an empty office, with many shelves of books and other records, as well as a computer terminal in front of a desk.

---

### **Frost** (2008-11-01 20:33:59)

EXO quickly moves to the computer and pops out his data link. He begins trying to access the information held on it.
"Watch the door."

### **Yogi** (2008-11-01 20:39:05)

Popping the lock they quickly entered and EXO went right to the computer terminal and hooked up to it. "Watching the door but don't take all day. I'd rather like to stay out of the arena." With quick looks out the door she makes ready to close the door softly if needed.
OOC: Perception +10, stealth +12 to close the door quickly and quietly.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-01 20:46:22)

Alex quietly closes the door, but on close inspection anyone would be able to see the lock had been opened. As exo attempts to view the information, he finds he needs to decrypt many layers of code. Exo barely manages to decrypt the first layer of coding and continues on.
Alex hears footsteps on the outside, but fortunately the person does not stop, and keeps on going

---

### **Yogi** (2008-11-01 20:50:47)

Alex held her breath as she heard the footsteps outside the door. She sighed quietly as they passed on. "That was close, we almost had company on that one. Better not pull any punches on this." She resumed her post at the door.

Tag nods at Xel'dan's grim prediction, "Possibly," though he doesn't seem at all concerned.
As the match begins Tag says, "Stay close." With that he moves to engage one of the draethos.

### **Thraken** (2008-11-03 18:16:10)

*damn* but he was committed now, and couldn't fall back in progress. With a fleeting mental image of some comedy holo where the protagonist dived into the box he was rummaging through to hide, Tafo instead snatches up the unit and sprints for cover.

Rohlan heads towards the arena (and will reach it in a few rounds)
---------------------------------------------------------------
tafo races into a gap between a pile of crates and quietly looks out the crack. A draethos guard walks in and takes a look around. His eyes drift to your position and hovers there, but he moves on after a few seconds.

### **Yogi** (2008-11-03 19:40:20)

At the sound of the door opening Alex goes flat against the wall that is behind the door with her hand on the grip of her blaster. She waits to see what the reaction of the person entering the room.

A well dressed Draethos enters the room, and is very surprised to see Exo plugged into his computer, he moves towards a wall, probably to press a switch on it.

### **Thraken** (2008-11-03 20:47:18)

Concealed, he is forced to play the waiting game once again. Stowing his prize Telon unhooks the blaster rifle - still set to stun from the earlier skirmish - from the back of his belt and lies in wait to see happens.

### **Thraken** (2008-11-05 13:47:13)

*Oh come on! Can't I get a break!?*
Tafo's mind is flooded with curses and the image of his Master's disapproving look. *"Running off, planning to sabotage some arms deal you come across and still no clue whether it has anything to do with the threat."*
*Isn't the force supposed to provide in dire situations? I need to keep going.*
He reaches out to the force for guidance as his next course of action forms in his mind.
((Search your feelings +10 - Is it important to the mission that I follow or track the the weapons? If so or inconclusive I hide in one of the friggin crates >_> If it's a red herring you've been beating me with I'll making a stealthy exit ))

tafo feels that the weapons are important, and so hides inside a crate. a few minutes later you feel the crate being picked up, and thrown roughly into a vehicle, which begins moving.

---

### **Thraken** (2008-11-06 13:05:33)

Not altogether sure how he ended up upside down, he reorients himself in some pain.
Hooking up his datapad to his high grade Jedi issue comlink he primes it for a brief and difficult to detect locator pulse. In addition to the units encryption, hopefully none of these people should detect it. Stowing the items back into their respective belt pouches, he moves to the next item on his to do list and senses the cargo bay in which his crate resides for any presences.
*((Use Computer +12 to ready the comlink to send a stealthy locator pulse on my command to the other team members' comlinks. My uber comlink also has the +10 DC encryption function. Sense Surroundings +10 and Perception +11 to see if there's anyone in the bay my box is in))*

Tagran thinks to himself, 'Alright, enough fooling around. They never *said* no blasters'. In one fluid motion he draws both blasters and fires at the draethos he's engaged with.

"The final warning kind." She replied with a bit of mystery. "The company I represent deals with people all over, I make sure that the deals are kept, sometimes at the cost of lives. Would you excuse me?"
Vita got up from her seat to approach the bartender. Unlike the rest of his kind, he seemed to be well versed in basic. If there was anyone here she could communicate with, it'd be him.
"I'm sorry, but you mentioned a lack of outside visitors, I was wondering if there have been any seen recently, before I arrived? I was sent here because of rumors surrounding an army here, not made of Draethos. Is it possible that they've hidden themselves on this world?"
She was both interested in his answer, and the way his answer came.

anyways....The bartender gives you an odd look but moves closer to you and whispers in his raspy voice "They say the bureaucrats have been gathering weapons for something big. The rumors say that an army have been supplying them, in exchange for soldiers. Maybe this has something to do with your army."

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-09 17:13:11)

A little suprised by Vitas statement, it was good information to know, and Devdan alway cared for information. Apparently there was more to this girl than he first thought.
He listended quietly as she taked to the bartender. That indeed sounded interesting, and he would have to find out more about it. Suddenly something tingled in the back of his mind. Rising from his chair, his hand slipped cautiously towards his blaster.
"Exuse me a moment"
In a single motion, he opened himself to the Force, swung around, and fired a stun blast against a draethos who had just drawn a gun.
((+9, 4d6+5 Stun Damage plus IÂ´ll acivate Battle Strike. If IÂ´m not in range for a stun blast, IÂ´ll move in range. Also as a note, that blaster is also always set to stun for default))

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-09 17:19:20)

Devdan unleashes a flurry of stun bolts into the draethos, and he falls down hard. The whole room goes silent at you and then mounts an uproar. They crowd around you and move in closer. You try to make your way to the door but it is blocked.
Suddenly, a draethos takes both of you through some hidden entrance, and yells at you "Run!"

---

### **Yogi** (2008-11-10 08:05:01)

Before she could react the Draethos hit a button on the wall as the alarm sounds. Drawing her blaster she fires a stun blast into the beings back.
Move action: draw weapon
free action: switch to stun
Standard action: fire blaster. +10 to hit and 3d8+10 for damage w/ PB shot

## \"Excuse me, but did you say...\" \"Run!\"

### **Parmenter** (2008-11-10 11:28:16)

"Thank yo..." As she was about to leave the company of the bartender, all hell broke loose. A couple of stun shots brought all the eyes in the room to Devdan and her by association. Then when an uproar began, Vita was grabbed by someone and thrown into a doorway that she didn't remember seeing. Her savior only had one word to say, "Run!"
Devdan had been thrown in the passage along with her. With little to do but what was instructed, she began shouting at her trouble making partner. "What the hell were you doing? I was about to take care of that myself, in a way, I might add that wasn't going to bring the whole house down on us."

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-10 11:41:55)

Not really suspecting such a horrible uproar, Devdan found himself showed away with Vita and told to run away. Not at all pleased at having been "saved", he started to follow Vita as she started to run.
"Well, how as I supposed to know that the local clientel was under a constant mod mentality? Anyway, I would have hoped to reason with them, but it seems someone didnÂ´t think we could take care of ourselves. I wish I had been able to speak to that guys intended target, or at least get to take him in for interrogation"
Looking around, he searches for a good place to disappear in.
"IÂ´m going back there. I donÂ´t like to leave my investigations unfinished"
As they ran past a dark alley, he broke of from the street and vanished into the shadows.
((Stealth +11))

### **ganthet** (2008-11-10 11:52:42)

As Rohlan gets to the arena he sees Tag in battle with one of the locals. "Can't take you any where *ner'vod*. Didn't your *biur* teach you how to play nice with others." Taking aim, Rohlan fires his blaster rifle at his friend combatant. "Keep him in the open Tag. This shouldn't take long."

Alex's shot is right on the mark and knocks him out cold. The alarm still flares though.
-------------------------------------------
The draethos who brought vita and devdan out of the cantina swears very loudly, and then says "stupid human! now I gotta rescue him. AGAIN!"
he turns and follows devdan.
Devdan reaches the back alley behind the cantina, and tries to open the door but it's locked.
-------------------------------------------
Rohlan (i'm assuming you're in the arena, as opposed to in the stands)
enters the fight, with a carefully aimed shot, picking off a draethos next to tagran. The crowd goes silent in the suprise of a new combatant, but then they start cheering for you too.
Two draethos, the ones with the most menacing look coincedentally, are the last two standing, and charges at you, and the other holds back, and seems to be guiding the other warrior.
The charging draethos goes right at Tagran, and hits tagran with his vibro-axe, dealing 24 points of damage. The force of his blow sends you back a few meteres.
The other draethos sends taunts at Tagran and Rohlan, calling you out to fight

With that said, Devdan disappeared into an alley.
> &quot;Stupid human! Now I gotta rescue him. AGAIN!&quot;

The Draethos who had accompanied them turned to follow Devdan. Not wanting to be alone, or for that matter she did not want to leave Devdan alone, Vita decided the group had better stick together. Vita managed to stop without killing herself and turned around as quickly as she could, "Ooh, then I'm going with you."

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-10 13:43:11)

"Blast, someone really wants to keep to himself"
Not really paying too much attenion to the people coming up behind him, Devdan produces a set of tools and starts to work on the lock.

devdan quietly picks the lock open and goes inside. You see you are in a kitchen of sorts, with all kinds of ingrediants around you, filling you with interesting scents.
Vita and the draethos are close to the cantina now (2 rounds behind)

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-10 14:24:51)

Quietly slipping inside, Devdan silently closes the door behind him. Reaching out with the Force as well as his other senses, he searches for anyone inside, moving cautiously along the dark portions of the walls. The air around him is heavy of various smells. He tries to identify the smells around him, wary of any kind of gassing or other toxins.
((Perception +11, Use the Force +11 to search the room. Stealth +11 to stay hidden while moving around.

devdan moves silently. You move near a window and take a peak through it, and you catch a glimpse of a sith trooper! He seems to be carrying the draethos you knocked out. you see the trooper drop a sphere, and it immediately releases some sort of gas. you hold your breath

---

### **Valheru** (2008-11-10 16:41:09)

Tag chuckles, â€œI must have missed that lesson, *ner vod*.â€ He ignores the draethosâ€™ taunts, preferring to let his blasters do the talking. However he canâ€™t help but grunt when the vibroaxe slams into his chest plate. Shaking his head he tells Rohlan, â€œThatâ€™ll leave a mark. Remind me not to catch axes that way again.â€ Tag brings his pistols to bear on the one charging him and opens fire.

Tagran feels the sting of electricity course through his body from the shockstaff but refuses to cry out. In response to their taunts he says merely, "It ain't over yet boys". Ignoring the one with the shockstaff for now Tag continues to fire at his original target.

Devdan had to say he was a little suprised to see the Sith trooper. Not a lot, but a little. His eyes widened a little as the soldier dropped a small sphere. As he watched, some kind of gas started to seep out of it. Steadying himself, he called upon the Force, using it to keep the air in his lungs.
He hesitated a moment. Vita and the draethos were still somewhere behind him, maybe he should wait for them. On the other hand, heÂ´d have a easier time following the trooper on his own. Plus, heÂ´d not draw them into anything stupid he might do.
Deciding, he cautiously started to stalk the trooper. This was what he did best, and he did it alone. Always alone.

Realizing that his opponent had seen him, Devdan decided the time for stealth was over. Leaving his hiding spot, he rushed at full speed towards the speeder, intent on stopping it from getting away. Or if he couldnÂ´t do that, at least get on board.

Vita follows her Draethos companion into the back door of the cantina. A quick look tells her she's entered a kitchen, but a smell in the air begins to bother her. She wobbles momentarily, and braces herself on a counter. After also feeling the effects the Draethos hands her a mask, which she graciously accepts.
"Thank you," was her muffled response. "Any sign of him?" She said, continuing the investigation. She surveyed the room trying to ascertain what happen to her over ambitious partner.

The cantina was deserted. *This place cleaned out in a hurry.* Vita looked around quickly, but didn't see anyone lurking. The sound of a vehicle starting up outside turned her head. The draethos and she shared a seconds glance, then both took off for the door. He beat her there by a couple steps, enough time for him to be through and have the door be open for her to pass through.

He pushed the stunned sith aside, trying to work with the controls to get the speeder to slow down, turn around, or at the very least, get it under his control. He just hoped the things wasnÂ´t on some kind of autopilot, but given the quality of the flying, he had a hard time beliving it.

Still, it is far from under his control, and it goes a little too fast for him to be comfortable not having control. Doing the best he can, he tries to get the speeder under his control.

Tag climbs into the back with the trooper. "Sure, but if we're doing it here don't blame me when he bleeds all over the upholstery," he says wryly. Tag starts removing the trooper's armor and equipment and makes sure his legs and arms are securely bound.

The trooper doesn't respond as you tie him up and remove his armor, sleeping soundly from Devdans stun blast

Once the two warriors gets into the speeder, Devdan takes off, moving it someplace more quiet, not really having an exact location, he just cruises around, seeking a good, quiet place to settle down.
As Rohlan boasts about Mandalorian interrogation techniques, he discreetly rolls his eyes.
*Ah yes, the fabled Mandalorian interrogation techniques…*
While driving the speeder, he replies back in a indifferent tone.
"Sure, just tell me when you want some help"

Tafo stands before the door staring upwards. He had made his way there after having decided that crawling and climbing around fast moving machinery to look down a chute where large crates are hurtling through at a fast clip thanks to industrial conveyor belts would be a bad idea.
Staring up at the air vent only seemed to show how very high the damned thing was. Too high, as his last run through the temple gym would indicate.
*Slow and patient it is then.* Locking his eyes on the keypad he advances whilst pulling out his belt toolkit. *Corridors are fast, but have almost nowhere to hide. I hope the walls are the same colour as my cloak.*
*((Seems like the superhero leap routine is a bit too hard so… Mechanics +12, spend some time to take 20 unlocking the thing without detection))*

### **Valheru** (2008-12-12 04:45:15)

Tag smirks, the day he asks an *aruetii* for help in an interrogation is the day he retires. The mando pulls out some smelling salts from his medpac to wake the trooper up. With his intimidating t-visor staring the man in the face Tag says, "Alright *burc'ya*, I'm going to ask you some questions and you're going to give me some answers." Tag draws his knife and flips it between the fingers of one hand adroitly, "If you don't answer honestly then I'm going to start cutting things off, got it? Now, let's start with an easy one. Where are the Sith located on Draethos?".

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-12 11:32:33)

*Real subtle…*
Devdan canÂ´t say he is too pleased about the Mandalorian warriorÂ´s technique, but he have to admit it is crudely effective. The Sith may be trained to resist such physical form of interrogation though, so maybe an alternate approach is needed. While piloting the speeder, he carefully reaches out for the Sith troopers mind with the Force, seeking an entrance, and something that might give him the answers he seeks.
((I take 10 to activate Farseeing, for a total of 21 against the Sith trooper. If I succeeds, IÂ´ll spend a Force Point to use Visions to trace the location of the Sith base, as surely he must have been there sometime))

OOC: sorry about not posting, my birthday today lol
Tagran wakes the sith, and he angrily glares at you. He keeps stoicly silent, not intimidated by your threatas.
Devdan sees a base in some location you don't know. It seems to be built into a mountain, and partially underground. Inside there is much machinery, though you don't know what it's for.
Tafo spends several minutes working on the lock, carefully unlocking it. After a few tense moments, the lock is opened, and the door slides open. In the hall on the outside, there is no one, and it is pretty dark. Unfortuanately, there are no places to hide.

Tagran punches the trooper in the nose, hard enough to break it. "Silence won't help you either," he says menacingly. Tag takes hold of the man's smallest finger and twists it painfully before cutting it off. Holding it up so the trooper can see it he says, "Answer me quickly and we can still get this reattached," his voice now gentle and reasonable. "Otherwise you'll have to go for cybernetics but those are expensive. Oh, and I highly doubt your masters will pay for it, even though it's your loyalty to them that caused such an injury." His tone drops ominously, suddenly sinister again, "Of course you have plenty of other fingers...for now."

"He doesn't seem to be impressed *ner'vod*. I think you might have to try harder." Rohlan pulls his blaster and places it on the soldiers knee joint. "My friend here is just trying to have a nice conversation with you and you have to be rude. That is not very nice. Now answer his question or you will walk with a limp for the rest of your life."
As Tag cuts off the soldiers finger off. Rohlan grimances. "Ouch that had to hurt, and he is right you had better talk cause you might pass out from the pain then we will have to start over again. That will make him upset and that is not a good thing."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-15 07:23:38)

*Sithspit, I knew I shouldnÂ´t have let the Draethos drag me out of those caves…it might be a different formation though…*
Suddenly he breaks out of his trance as he hears what the guys in the back seat is doing.
"Hey, I didnÂ´t go through all the trouble of taking him alive just so you could kill him before he tells anything"
Getting another idea if how to coax the Sith into being more friendly, Devdan once again raches out to the troopers mind, this time sending forth a short message. Doing his best to mimic the voice of the Sith Lord they had seen in the recording, he sends the word "traitor" into the mind of the trooper, trying to add an intimidating tone behind it.
((DonÂ´t know if this is really possible, but IÂ´ll take 10 on Use the Force to send the telepathic message for a result of 21))

### **ganthet** (2008-12-15 11:11:41)

"Oh we aren't going to kill him. Yet." Rohlan continues to draw attention to the blaster pointed that he has pointed at the soldiers knee. "Besides I am sure that if this one dies the galaxy will be a some what better place. I know I will feel better."
Rohlan has no intentions of killing him unless he has to. "Any new on the others have they found anything interesting?"

### **Thraken** (2008-12-15 11:40:43)

Feeling his heart pumping away he hastily stows his toolkit and pulls his appropriated rifle off his belt once more. Running through another quick weapons check he confirms the weapon is still set to stun.
*Still not entirely sure what I'm doing here…* Tafo looks back to check the direction in which the crates are being moved off to. *Thataway.*
Tafo fully unfurls his dark travelling cloak and raises his hood while stepping out into the corridor. Hopefully his dark cloak would make him a little harder to spot in the dark. Letting the doors shut behind him he advances swiftly and quietly down the corridor with the rifle held in front through the gap in the cloak.
*((Stealth +17, I'm trying to get to see where those crates are going - so moving down the corridor in that vague direction.))

The sith trooper, bloodied by the beating , still won't respond to you. To Devdans telepathy he pours pure anger into it, causing you to retract your mind from his.
---------------
Tafo sneaks vaguely to where the crates are going, he spots no one. Ahead of him, in the long, dark corridor he is in, Tafo spots a few doors on the sides of the hallway ahead

Tag snorts and shakes his head, "Well you're a tough little *di'kut*, not that it'll do you much good."
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Tagran sets the knife down and draws his pistol. Setting it on the lowest power setting he uses it to slowly cauterize the trooper's wound. No sense letting him bleed out, plus it's also *extremely* painful. Satisfied the wound is sealed he starts to grab the knife but then reconsiders. "There is no reconstructive surgery for this I'm afraid." He grabs the man's next finger and starts to slowly burn the flesh away in a truly agonizing process.

"I'm just curious what these Sith have done to earn such loyalty. You might as well make it easy on yourself and tell us what you know."

The sith screams out in pain as you torture him. He opens his mouth, but no sound comes out, probably prevented by the searing pain.

Rohlan watches as Tag continues questoining the prisoner. "*Ner'vod* I don't think he like a hospitally. That is an insult to Mandalorians, we don't look apon that very kindly. Might as well tell us what we want to know and this will all be over."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-18 13:04:34)

As his mind suddenly fills with anger, Devdan quickly retracts his own mind from the Siths.
*Say what you will about Sith Lords, but they know how to motivate their soldiers…*
Deciding to let the mandalorians handle the questioning for now, he starts to pilot the airspeeder back towards the caves they had been in earlier.
Clicking his comm, he tries to get in touch with some of the other small teams of the group.
"Vita? Are you there? Sorry I lost you back there, but you know how things are. Have anyone else found something so far?"

---

### **Thraken** (2008-12-19 16:25:17)

*Uhh… around this way… direction… I guess… I need a map or signs or something.*
Having gotten to the vague area, Tafo decides to check the rooms out. Normally it would have been a heart pounding whip open the door and hope you get whatever's in there before they get you - with the equipment at hand that is. But that was before the Jedi Order...
He listens to the force as he slowly creeps past the doors

### **ganthet** (2009-01-04 20:38:22)

Rohlan is impressed that the trooper is able to take this amount of pain without cracking. That could be a problem, any information could be lost if they killed him trying to get at it. " *I don't think this one is going to tell us what we want *ner'vod*. But on the bright side his boss must by now know that he is in our company and that he will more then likely die when he reports in that he did tell  us anything. That what I would do with him if I was his boss." Rohlan moves his blaster pistol up to the trroopers head. "You could save yourself alot of pain when that happens at least I would make it quick."*

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-05 23:10:05)

"Hahaha" the trooper laughs, even knowing that he probably won't live this through, "You'll have to kill me, because either way I'm dead, and I'm not giving you what you want to know."

---

### **ganthet** (2009-01-08 12:33:35)

"*Di'kut!* I was going to make it quick but now I think I will kill you slowly." Rohlan moves the blaster back down to the troopers knee and pulls the trigger. As the blaster dicharges into the troopers knee, Rohlan is spared the smell of burning flesh and ozone form the blaster it self.
Moving the blaster over to his other knee. "Now shall we try this again?"

Actually a little suprised that the Sith cracked before he was killed, Devdan at least smiled. He was a little worried that none of his companions had answered though. Looking back towards his two passengers, he called out.
"Nice job, now get him over here and have him tell me where in these blasted mountains that base of his is"

The lone Jedi padawan starts sweating. Pressured on several fronts with retreat not drawing many options he decides on a gamble. Concealing his rifle underneath his cloak he slowly walks towards the approaching person.
Straining his eyes in the gloom, he would have to identify them as soon as possible in order to decide to fight, run or talk poodoo like he's never done before.
((perception +11 to identify whoever when he gets close enough, and ready to stun blast him if obviously sith or going to shoot me. Or run away if there's a lot of bad people.

You see a man, strangely enough not in armor. It doesn't seem as if he can see you yet, so you figure he's probably not a force user. Tafo readies his weapon, prepared to stun him if he proves dangerous.

Rohlan continues to keep his blaster pointed at the troopers head. "See how easy that was? No reason to be rude now is there. Whats the security like? What kind of resitants can we expect?" Rohlan was going to milk him for every bit a info he could be finish him off.

As Davdan leaves the pilots chair, he feels a sudden jolt in the Force behind him. Not suprised, he turns around to see Rohlan and the dead soldier.
"You really had to do that? It would be a lot easier to use his clothing and gear as a disguise if it wasnÂ´t holed by a blaster shot and bloodstained"
As he moves past the Mandalorian, he takes care to hide his lightsabers inside his vest. No sense givign away too much, even if they were his allies. Exiting the speeder, he takes a look aound himself, trying to determine where to go.

I am not walking in there without knowing what I am going to run into. I am not being paid that well." Rohlan moves up toward where the landing pad and enterance would be.

Tafo continues trading shots with the sith, hitting him again, but the sith still remaining standing. Tafo continues to roll and duck, dodging a few close shots. Tafo reachs to his comlink and sends out the location pulse.
As Devdan and Rohlan exit the speeder, both of their comlinks go off. On Rohlan's HUD he sees a dot well inside the mountain.

### **ganthet** (2009-01-25 16:04:50)

"Great. It appears one of our friends is in trouble. I have his location." Rohlan switches on his commlink. "Rohlan here. I have your location inside the mountain. What is your situation?"

Devdan finds Tafo deep inside the complex, feeling Tafos fear as he fights for his life.
All Rohlan hears are the sounds of blaster fire, as Tafo weaves to get a good shot.
Tafo and the sith continue to battle, leaving black carbon stains everywhere. Tafo gets clipped by a shot and takes 7 damage, but making a spectacular shot, hits the troopers belt, exploding a grenade on it, killing the trooper.

### **Valheru** (2009-01-27 04:12:53)

Tag steps out of the speeder and looks down at the dead trooper, "Nice work *ner vod*. Say what you want about this Sith Lord, but he certainly inspires loyalty." The mando checks once more to make sure they didn't miss anything on the troopers corpse before lifting it to a decent hiding spot. Finally he grabs the trooper's armor plates from the speeder just in case they decide to use them as a disguise.
Not hearing any response on the comlink, Tag checks Tafo's location on his HUD and compares it to what he can see from their surroundings. "Well shall we try and extract our overeager companion?"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-27 06:09:14)

"Tafo, see if you can finish that and get us some more detail on how to get to you the quickest. I will keep this channel open." Grabbing his Blaster rifle. and checking the charge.

Telon flinches then stands there for a moment, wounds giving out burning pain, not hit by any damaging shrapnel. He wonders if he will ever be able to manage a clean and relatively simple mission.
Finally hearing his comlink going off he still does not spare a moment for it. Flicking over the rifle to full (which by all accounts seems more reliable) he sweeps towards a door.
At the room where he had sensed an occupant, he activates the door controls , aims his rifle inside and yells "FREEZE!"

Tafo steps into a room filled with scientists of various species, all in shining silver lab coats. They all wear stark black visors, almost making them look like sith troopers. The scientists all cower in fear of your rifle, holding their hands above their heads.
Rohlan observes they can try and enter through a small sidecave, as it seems to have less defenses. Tagran silently stalk through the entrance, observing for any sith. Rohlan and Devdan follow him.

A little worried about his friend, Devdan paces between the two Mandalorian warriors. He didnÂ´t really like the concept of sneaking into a Sith base, but he had been through worse. The guys could probably handle whatever grunts came at them, but if they had an unfortunate encounter with a true Sith he supposed it would fall on him to handle it. It had been some time since he last fought in a lightsaber duel, but he felt certain he could handle it.

Tag makes the necessary adjustment to share video feeds with Rohlan, "Good idea *ner vod*. I can't make out how many yet but they're headed this way. If by chance they don't spot us should we take them out or continue on stealthily?".

"Agreed *ner'vod*. We slot them then move on. So far the rear is clear." Rohlan readys himself for the fight. "Tafo, is there any way you can link up with us so we don't move around in here seperately?"
((OCC: Computer use +11 to send Tafo a map and our location."

EDITED
Outside Tafo hears banging on the door, giving him a bad feeling.
Tagren and Rohlan's HUD link together, allowing both of them to see the map of where they are. At the same time you hear footsteps, quietly sneaking towards you, not coming from your group.

His heart pounding, he blanks out his emotions in a semi-meditative state and fixes a look of angry irritation on his face.
Tafo tersely hisses down his comlink "Stuck with enemy noncombatants and cut off by angry hostiles. Later." He places the comlink on a workstation where the map is displayed
"So." He blasts the door control panel with a casual shot and continues to address his very temporary hostages in an irritated voice. "What is the purpose of this facility you people have gotten me lost in?"
Quickly yet without rushing, he works to send the incoming mandalorians the map and provide a link to the computers if necessary, the rifle never straying far from his hands.
((Blast the door panel a la what they did all the time on the Death Star -_-))
((Use Computer +12 to send map and after that, attempt to open up the computer to a remote link if possible))
((Persuasion +10 with the scientists))

Tafo hits the panel, hopefully keeping the door locked out.
One scientists stammers, "I don't know, they never told us why."
(Tafo needs a few more rounds to link teh computers)
