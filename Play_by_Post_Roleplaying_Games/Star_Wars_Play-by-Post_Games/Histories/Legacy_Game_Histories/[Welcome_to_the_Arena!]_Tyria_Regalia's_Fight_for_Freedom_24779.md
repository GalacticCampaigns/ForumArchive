# [Welcome to the Arena!] Tyria Regalia's Fight for Freedom

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-17 18:56:53)

Having heard about the Arenas and the sanctuary offered there, Tyria Regalia finds herself sitting at a small Vid-caf outside one on Killee-Kor. The Vid-cafs have sprung up all around the Arenas, providing live feeds of low-stakes matches with the comforts of food and drink and without the chaos and crowds of the stands. She sits sipping a caf and debating her options. Through her inquiries she has found that the hunting of gladiators is strictly prohibited by Rav, the only bounty broker for several sectors. The reasoning is easy to figure out: if the hunted die in the Arena, he claims the bounty; if they live, they won't for long. On the other hand, it represents the perfect opportunity to make many credits while staying (relatively) safe.
A droid server approaches her table and asks, **"Would you like anything else sentient?"**

## You really are obsessed with coffee, aren't you?

Tyria slowly sipped from her cup, not tasting what was in it, but remembering the taste of things she'd drank so long ago. It was an exercise that reinforced her feelings that she had been human once, but now was forever encased in this machine. A smirk of a predator crossed her lips as she watched one combatant beat another with his bare fists while kneeling over his fallen foe. It gave her a flash back to a couple months ago, when it was her kneeling over a body savagely attacking it. It had been in defense of her own life, no, her own *existence*. Something about the experience had changed her. It had shook loose some part of her that was angry, bloodthirstily so. She had had her humanity ripped from her, and now others were trying to take what was left. She desperately needed an outlet for her feelings of hate and rage. Which was why she was here.
The Arena offered her the two things she need at this point in time. Protection, and projection. It opened opportunities to vent the rage that has overcome her recently, whilst giving her sanctuary from the source that had brought it on, namely the EMI, and it's bounty for her return to their laboratories. Her foot rubbed up against the bag underneath her seat, she hoped that it's contents would be enough to grant her entry into Rav's system.
As the screens faded for an announcement, the droid that had been serving her came over to see if she'd like some more. She replied in turn, **"No, thank you, I have somewhere else I need to be."** As she stood to leave she looked back to the monitors as a another fight commenced. With her bag in hand she left the Vid-caf, but not before one more look at the droid who'd served her. *Time to see if I truly am who I think I am.*

The huge building she approaches is hexagonal, and its walls are roughly four meters tall. The massive doors look to have never been closed, and a protocol droid stands behind a small desk off to the left with a sign hanging over its head stating in dozens of languages **Information and Registration**. A small crowd leaves, chattering amongst themselves excitedly about the match that just ended. The howls of creatures both sentient and not surround the place like a liquid, flowing and rippling.
As she walks up to the desk she sees a hulking brute leaving it. There is something suspiciously familiar about the being, but putting a finger on what is beyond her at the moment. The droid turns to her, **"Greetings my lady. Will you be participating or gambling today?"**

There were many kinds wandering around the foyer of the Arena. And while some of the persons were easily categorized as either spectator or combatant, there was a large percentage that Tyria couldn't quite place definitely in one group or the other. There was a brief wait in line for the registration desk, and after the large figure in front of her was done she approached the desk, and the droid behind it. **"Greetings my lady. Will you be participating or gambling today?"** asked the droid. **"Participation, though tell me, is there a minimum wager for someone wishing to gamble?"** She had very few credits left, and was anxious to turn that problem around.

The protocol droid responds, **"No, m'lady, there is no minimum bet in the Crucible. The other Tiers have minimums, but this one does not. The payout will vary on the odds offered though, which aren't very good since most gladiators here are unknown. The Crucible matches (those against non-sentient creatures with no wagered item) have larger purses and offer better odds, but are much more dangerous. Would you like to see what we have available? If you need more information on betting, you'll have to speak to my counterpart further inside. Here is a datacard with the rules and regulations for participants."** The droid hands Tyria a datacard.
As she accepts the card she sees the hulking brute's helmet over the crowd rounding a corner and moving out of her sight. The rear of the helmet's shape and color triggers a memory of another, very similar helmet, she had seen recently- on the head of the being she beat to death in an alleyway...

Tyria takes the card with the information she needs. To clarify her next destination she points toward a flow of people beyond the desk, **"I need to head that way for your counterpart, correct?"**. Looking past her hand she sees a familiar helmet off in the distance. *It can't be.* Not waiting for a response she starts after the helmet. She was certain Gyal was dead, so who was this? Was it someone related? Or someone who had taken the helmet after she'd dumped the body into the street. Curiosity was getting the best of her as she quickened her step.
(Perception +8 to see what she can about the person in question.)

Stepping quickly, Tyria moves around the corner, just catching sight of the brute as he passes through a door marked **Gladiators**. This being is easily head and shoulders taller than Gyal, and the helmet is easily larger than the one she had caved in in that alleyway.
The glimpse she catches of the being before the doors close shows a remarkable likeness in its armor and Gyal's. Black and thick, the armor bristles with weapons and gadgetry, and emblazoned on the center of the back is a symbol that she can't make out from here. She is willing to bet, though, that it would match the one she scarred on Gyal's back: a deep crimson stylized sun.
Just across the crowded hall from where she stands is another desk that a multitude of beings crowd around, yammering all at once. The modified medical droid behind the desk utilizes its many arms to take bets from several at a time, using its advance memory to record them all.
Forward there are four short staircases with doors at the top that a safe assumption would place as the stands. Out side each door stands a ticket taker of some form, be it droid or organic.

She stops dead in her tracks for a moment, *If this guy is a friend of Gyal's and he's here for me, there no point in going to him. I'm sure he'll come to me soon enough.*
Tyria takes note of the medical droid as she crosses the room. She had no intention of betting on anything without first seeing what it was capable of. But she knew that she would be visiting the medical droid sometime in the future, so she made sure to remember where it was located within the building. Her destination was the Gladiators entrance, there was no time like the present to start her career here. She remembers the datacard in her pocket, and begins looking for a terminal that will allow her to access the rules and regs within it.

Off to the left of the medical-turned-bookie droid Tyria finds a Arena Information Terminal, with a basic map of this Arena and a copy of the rules. According to the map, in order to register for a match she will have to go back to the protocol droid she spoke to first. After reading over the rules she is reminded that in order to gain the protection of the Arena she has to be a participant.

Ignoring the reminiscent figure for the time being, Tyria decided to return to the protocol droid from before. She was ready to begin her career here, and if she understood the benefits of it, she would need that career to stay safe here. *Oh the irony.* She thought. After waiting in line for another moment she was at the familiar droid. **"Excuse me, I would like to sign up for a match. If it matters, my name, is Tyria Regalia."**

**"Very well my lady. I will enter your name, though we usually don't bother with new fighters because they tend to last such a short amount of time. We generally wait till they've at least won one bout. We have four matches available, three soloist like yourself and one Crucible,"** the droid responds as he punches in commands on his console and a view screen comes to life on the wall behind him, displaying the matches and their purses and wagers, **"Which would you like?"** The droid gestures to the wall behind it.
On the projected screen Tyria can see the following entries:

Twi'lek blaster carbine 1500
Jawa blaster pistol 1500
Nautolan flechette launcher 1500
Tusken Raiders 2500

Tyria thought carefully about the list, perhaps a bit of tact was needed in this situation, so as to not show her enthusiasm to this event so soon. Taking the easiest seeming target would make her seem cowardly or weak. Allowing her to fool any later combatants, if only for a moment.
**"I'll take the Jawa."** She continued, **"Here's my wager item."** She reached for the Gyal's rifle, showing it to the droid.
OOC: Sorry for the wait, I kept forgetting about this game. And have been pretty well occupied irl.

**"Very good,"** the droid replies as it passes a scanner over the rifle. **"Your wager meets the requirements. You may find your opponent down the left-most corridor, third door on the left. Pit four. Good luck, my lady,"** the droid finishes as it moves on to help the other incoming sentients.
Following the directions with ease Tyria finds herself in a small room with a human male whose breastplate is emblazoned with 'NON-COMBATANT' in large yellow lettering. The man gives her a grim smile and begins a well rehearsed speech: **"Go through the door behind me, you find yourself behind a grate. When it rises, do your thing. After your enemy is dealt with you'll be introduced to the crowd and given your winnings: the wager and a purse of fifteen hundred credits. If you have any questions ask them now. Otherwise, good luck."**
