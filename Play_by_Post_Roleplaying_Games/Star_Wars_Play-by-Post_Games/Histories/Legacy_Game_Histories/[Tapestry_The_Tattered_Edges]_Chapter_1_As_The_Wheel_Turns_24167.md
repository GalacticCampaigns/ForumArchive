# [Tapestry: The Tattered Edges] Chapter 1: As The Wheel Turns

**((Opening Crawl))**
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**STAR WARS: Tapestry, The Tattered Edges
Episode I: AS THE WHEEL TURNS**</span>
The galaxy is in a state of constant turmoil. With the surprise emergence of a new Sith Empire, the tentative peace assured for the last century by the Galactic Alliance and Jedi Order has been shattered, while Roan Fel, the Emperor-in-Exile, strives to regain the new-found glory of the Empire, and restore the galaxy to order under his rule.
Profiting from the chaos is the Fringe element. On the frayed outskirts of civilized society live the pirates, smugglers, bounty hunters and others that thrive on the strife and discord engendered by a galaxy perpetually at war. But even on the Rim, far from the core of galactic civilization, legends are born, heroes die, and even the lowliest moisture farmer will make decisions of epic proportions.
********************************************************************************
The Wheel is a massive space station located in the Besh Gorgon system, in the Mid Rim. True to its name, the station is ring-shaped with four spokes meeting a long, tower-like section piercing its center. Home to all manner of smugglers, gamblers, tradesmen, and thrill-seekers, the Wheel has managed to remain a position of neutrality in the galaxy for centuries. The means to maintaining this neutrality comes through all manner of bribes, treaties, kickbacks, tax payments, and even the occasional military action.
But what the Wheel is best known for is its many casinos and entertainment facilities. Amongst the most popular of establishments is the Wheel Within a Wheel Casino and Resort, home to the hottest sabacc tables in the galaxy... or so it claims. Beings the galaxy over come to the Wheel Within a Wheel to spend and make their fortune, as well as to escape the rigorous laws and restrictions of larger galactic governments.
In fact, crime lords, entrepreneurs, and even major governments use The Wheel, and the Wheel Within a Wheel Casino in particular, as a neutral stage for sensitive negotiations.
********************************************************************************
**"You see?! Naxy found you one o' them… whatchacall'ems… *Sweet-liver* deals, eh?"**
The Sakiyan's shrill voice screeched over the clamor surrounding the big gambling wheel. Waiving the Mandalorian over, Naxy Screeger began walking towards a doorway shrouded by a beaded curtain.
**"Naxy Screeger always hits the… whathis… *Jack-kettle*!"**
When Naxy holds the curtain aside, Al'verde sees poshly appointed auction hall just beyond. The dull whisper of conversation drifts to him at the doorway, and all manner of species sit huddled over various tables within. Off to his left, and around the large Barabel that had been quietly flanking the door, he sees several tables of items being sold after not being bid on in the auction. In the middle of one of the tables is a set of Beskar'gam, although obviously not as heavy as that which the Mandalorian wore himself.
Al'verde had heard rumor that an assortment of antique Mandalorian goods were to be auctioned off, and a couple of inquiries lead him to the Wheel Within the Wheel Casino. Lead him to Naxy Screeger, somehow had access to the auction and would allow the Mandalorian in for a small finders fee.
On a raised dais at the center of the room, the auctioneer is presenting his next item: A large crystal and metallic casket, which appears to be currently occupied.
********************************************************************************
Kanos watches as the Mandalorian marches past him into the auction hall, accompanied by a rather twitchy Sakiyan. He had been stationed there on security detail, along with his Barabel counterpart, and both now stood flanking the door.
As the Zabrak swept his gaze over the auction hall's inhabitants, he had to keep himself sharp lest boredom take over. At one table an Ithorian sat nursing a drink, anxiously looking over his shoulder every so often until the latest auction came up, whereby he sat forward at the edge of his seat. Another table near the Ithorian held a Zeltronian who seemed more interested with the small computer sitting in his lap then the auction itself. A couple, human male and female, sits in a shrouded corner of the hall, their heads bowed together likely whispering sweet nothings to one another. Not too far from them, a Feeorin with a cybernetic eye scowled at an Aqualish, who could only be described as wearing a poodoo-eating grin.
Yep, looks like it was going to be another boring detail for Kanosâ€¦
********************************************************************************
**â€œAn even 200k, Kurr. The ship is practically brand new, and Master Rav is almost *giving* it to youâ€¦ With a small finders fee, of course.â€**
The Aqualish leered across the table at Kurr, its mouth quivering in an approximation of a cruel smile. On the table between the two lay a datapad with a binding contract scrolling across it and a fingerprint capture device at its bottom, and a cylinder lock attuned to the security systems of a particular vessel.
The goon's cruel smile grew even deeper and more malicious as he leaned back in his chair. When Kurr had contacted Rav about securing a loan for the ship, the old pirate had offered Kurr an even better deal: a fully armed Nemesis-patrol ship Rav had *requisitioned*  from a small-time Black Sun vigo that had run afoul of the one-legged Feeorin. Kurr knew that Rav was charging him easily an extra twenty-thousand creds ontop of what the patrol boat cost brand new.
**"And we both know Rav the Crimson Axe ain't one to be refused. So whadya say?"**
********************************************************************************
Nestil and Jaster sat off in a corner of the dimly-lit auction hall, speaking to one another in hushed tones. Both Imperial Knights were covertly dispatched to the Wheel to meet with an informant who claimed to have had information vital to the effort to restore the true Emperor. They were told to look for the Ithorian in red, but so far a handful of Ithorians dotted the patrons of the auction hall, but none seemed to be wearing anything particularly crimson.
**"Would either of you two lovebirds care for a drink?"**
A Devaronian waitress sidled up to their table and offered menus.
********************************************************************************
The Ithorian had been nervously sitting through the auction for close to an hour now, but it did not seem that Rehn was the one he was looking out for. Sheffro Gil'usa, the bothan owner of the Wheel Within the Wheel casino had ordered the young Zeltronian to begin following the Ithorian when Rehn's attempts to figure out how the hammerhead kept winning proved fruitless. But so far, the only peculiar thing the Ithorian had done was be twitchy, and there were countless number of those sorts all over the station.
An alert chimed in on Rehn's personal computer: an angry message from Sheffro asking about his progress.
********************************************************************************
**"Feast your eyes, ladies and gentlemen, on the next wonder we have to offer!"**
The Krish auctioneer made an overly-dramatic bow and flourish towards the casket-like device behind him. As he did, it slowly spun on a revolving dais built into the floor, but judging by the awful grinding noises coming from the dais it hadn't been properly tended to in a long time. Frowning briefly, the Krish recovers his perpetual smile as he stands aside so that the audience may gain a better view.
Standing nearly three meters in length, the box is richly made by seemingly simple in design. Blue metal of an unidentifiable origin makes most of the casket, while the lid and parts of the sides are made of a semi-opaque crystaline material. The casket is in overall good condition, but the keen-eyed can see a few old scorch marks, chips, and scratches where multiple attempts had been made to open it. Those close to the stage can see what appears to be a young human male sleeping inside of the casket, completely oblivious to the world.
**"Here for your bidding pleasure, we have… a Jebble Box! One of only two to have ever been found, this relic of ancient times is said to house a king of a long extinct civilization, and the secrets to all of his riches! Shall we begin the bidding at 50,000 credits?"**
As the bidding began in earnest, a barely-perceivable change began in the so-called Jebble Box. The crystal of the oubliette became more and more transparent, and it slowly became more clear to all the spectators that the casket held a tall youth with light brown hair who was mostly nude.
Before long, the bidding came down to just two: the twitchy Ithorian and an attractive blonde woman wearing a long cloak of expensive silk. Rehn and the pair of Imperial Knights notice that the Ithorian has been using a bright red bidding paddle, when just about everyone else have been using the casino-provided paddles, which are a dark brown.
**"Going once! Going twice! Sold to the Ithorian in Red for 1.2 million credits!"**
As the Krish auctioneer banged his gavel on his podium, a loud hiss issues from the oubliette, and then a large curtain of steam. The auctioneer dives for cover, and many of the patrons go scattering away from dais as the lid to the casket slowly begins to slide open. Oddly enough, neither the twitch Ithorian or the blonde woman shy away; on the contrary the blonde woman glides to her feet and stalks her way toward Oubliette while the Ithorian does so as well, although much more timidly.
********************************************************************************
Even the dimness of the auction hall is blinding to Wes, as his eyes hadn't been opened in close to two centuries. Awareness rushes in on the Mandalorian, and he finds himself with a sudden and powerful sickness. To either side of him is an Ithorian and a beautiful blonde, although they do not seem to have noticed Wes's being conscious.
They suddenly do become aware as Wes is unable to maintain his standing posture in the oubliette without the casket being sealed, and tumbles out to land naked on his hands and knees, retching violently. Off to his right, Wes sees a table bearing his armor and weapons, as well as an assortment of gear and other odds and ends.
Both the Ithorian and the blonde leap back from the ever-expanding pool of spittle in front of the newly-awakened Mandalorian, but as the blonde does so she draws a holdout blaster from within her cloak and takes aim at the Ithorian. At the exact same moment, three others pull concealed weapons, while the Barabel standing next to Kanos raises his blaster rifle and prepares to let off a shot.
To his credit, the Ithorian seems a great deal more agile than what is typical of his people, as he dives and hides behind the oubliette. The other attendees of the auction need no further prompting to disperse, as they exit the auction hall in a panic.
**"You should have just let me have it, Ithorian. Now I will take it, and you, for the glory of Emperor Krayt!"
"Half a million credits to whoever gets me and this casket away from this station!"**
The Ithorian's panicked shout reverberates in the auction hall, and it is punctuated soon after with a hail of blaster bolts from the blonde, barabel, and their associates.

"Frak," when the Oubliette started to activate. Immediately, Kanos activated his comm link. "Boss, something strange is going on down here," said Kanos as he looked at his partner. "We might have..." *Not yet*, he thought. It could be nothing.
*Nothing my butt*, was all he thought when the blonde pulled out a hold blaster. "Hey, whore*, your under fraking arrest for bringing fraking weapons onboard and threatening the patrons. Drop the frakking blaster before I make you fraking drop it." Kanos immediately brought his blaster rifle up, taking aim at her as he made sure it was on kill. *Go ahead, ya fraking whore*, make my day. I'll fraking gut you and any other fraking Imperial that so much gives me a fraking reason.*
Almost immediately after making his order, his Barabel partner started to fire.

Rehn quickly hammered out a message back to his employer, his long fingers flying expertly over the keyboard. "I'm doing the best I can, boss. If you wanted results faster, you should have put Glicks on it."
His message complete, he turned his gaze back to the Ithorian, just as the alien began bidding on a crystal casket--the first thing he'd bid on since Rehn had arrived. His green eyes burned with hatred for the Ithorian. For weeks, he'd been watching him win endlessly, all without cheating. Nothing Rehn did seemed to change that. What was his secret?
When the Ithorian won the auction, Rehn turned his eyes to the oubliette as it hissed open and a naked man tumbled out. Well, that was interesting. Rehn didn't have much time to dwell on it though, before the shooting started. A blonde woman shot first but others around the auction hall quickly joined in. Rehn quickly ducked behind a row of chairs as the crowd flooded out around him. He tucked his computer away in his bag--he'd paid a small fortune in credits for it and wasn't about to let it get destroyed.
His comlink, tucked next to his ear under his bright purple hair, went on with a word. "Gil'usa, we have a problem down here. Some idiot started a firefight in the auction hall--and with that blasted Ithorian, no less."

Nesti Ronda checked her chrono once again, tapping her foot under the table impatiently. She looked stunning even in the bulky robes that concealed her armor. She cased the Waitress a paralyzing glare. Her apparent cover was as a noble woman slumming it on the station. "I will NOT mistake my bodyguard for a romantic interest again." Was all she said to her.
Her mind wasn't on the items that were actually up for auction, and she finally slammed her hand against the table. "I need to stay here, So you start walking around and look for him."
Suddenly the auction came to a conclusion, and The noblewoman turned Imperial Knight heard two important phrases. "Ithorian in red" and "Glory of Darth Krayt." Not needing to hear another word, she draws her own Lightsaber and activated it.
"Stand down in the name of the True Emperor!"
(Move: Draw Lightsaber
Swift: activate Lightsaber
Standard: used to move to the closest attacker.

Al'verde looked at the armor as best he could. He knew it wasn't the armor any of his squad wore but he knew it was mando armor. **"Where did they find this, and how did it survive for so long?"** he asked himself. He also couldn't help but notice that the armor had the same coloring as his. This only raise more questions, questions that he didn't have time to answer.
As he eyes fixed on casket he looked at the man sleeping ins side and wondered if he ad done something to be sold off or if he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He let out a small sigh hoping that none of his squad had fallen to the same fate.
As the man fell out of the casket Al'verde watched everything get out of control and went to activate is weapon systems. As his hud came online it said that all weapons were out of ammo. At that point he remembered that he had left everything but his hold-out blaster at the check-point **"Oh well I'll just have to make due without my besbe'trayce.**" he said as he charged the blond pulling out some mesh tape.
(( swift to pull out mesh tape. Move to move in closer, Standard to tackle her [unarmed +2] ))

Jaster Mitsun scans the crowd looking for the Ithorian in red. Jaster nods to Nestil and stands to make a circuit around the room when he notices the Ithorian with the red paddle and the commotion around the stage.
Jaster springs to Nestils side and draws his saber in a smooth practiced motion cutting upward forcing anyone in our path back. "MOVE ASIDE!" Jaster shouts with authority.

Kurr looks at the Aqualish with a squint and snorts a bit as he says, "That depends … what's Rav adding on to it? Any … *special* … modifications? I'm sure he'll want me to run jobs for him … and, well, we wouldn't want the same poodo to happen like last time, right?"
While speaking, he glances at the action going on and slowly pulls his pistol under the table and at the ready, expecting the worse. The quiet whistle of the rifle can be heard by any around him. He looks back to the Aqualish and says, "Seems there's a rowdy crowd in here t'night … wouldn't want any of that spillin' over to us, now would we?"

*I'm so tired*
Wes laid there where he was. He was tired, so tired he didn't want to move. He tried to moved his arm to feel for his carbine which was never far. Yet the neurological impulses that would normally cause his arm to move failed.
*Oh Wes what did you do last night?*
The sound of a loud hissing came to his ears as well as an immense brightness to his eyes. This time he did move. His arm came up to shield his eyes. From behind his arm he could see and almost feel the presence of two next to him. One an Ithorian and the other and beautiful blond.
*Ohhh, What **did** you do last night?* He thought in exasperation.
He attempted to sit up but the unexpected movement brought on the unexpected urge to empty his stomach. Not knowing he was in a standing position he fell forward arms shot out on reflex as his hands and knees took the brunt of the short fall. His back arched as his insides came roaring out and splattering all over the floor in front of him. The light which wasn't as bad as before let him see a bit. He looked to his right. Tables were there loaded with things. They looked odd but familiar. His head slumped and hung there. **"what's happening"** He said softly to no one in particular. His head drooped farther as he looked at himself. Seeing the state of his nakedness started to clear up the fogginess of his mind quicker than being shot. He could count the number of times he had been without his armor in the past two years on both hands.
A realization hit him and his head snapped up to look at the table. Black and grey items were there. Blinking his eyes in an attempt to focus was mildly successful as he recognized what they were. His Beskar'gam and carbine. He was armor less and weaponless. Not a good situation to be in. He tried to remember what happened. He remembered the old man and how he was talking. From what he recalled he sounded like a Jedi. Telling him how he would 'be needed and of 'potential'.
He didn't have time to dwell on it as he noticed the blond drawing a blaster and all hell breaking loose. He could hear her voice. "You should have just let me have it, Ithorian. Now I will take it, and you, for the glory of Emperor Krayt! "Half a million credits to whoever gets me and this casket away from this station!"
He had no idea who was she talking about as he crawled as quickly as possible for the table that had his armor and weapons on it. Either way it sounded bad as other voices added to the commotion.
One word stood out though. 'Besbe'trayce' It was a Mando word. He tried to speak but found that his throat was dry. He took a deep breath and force the word out through clenched teeth. **'Hukaat'kama'** The word was said in the direction he heard the Mando speaking
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Hukaat'kama = Watch my back/watch my six

</details>

He continued for the table. He focus was on the carbine. *Its time to shoot and ask questions later.* He thought.

As Jaster draws his lightsaber and ignites it, those few pedestrians still in his way let out a terrified shriek and flee from him, even more so when he begins to wave it menacingly. The sith spy closest to him turns with a snarl and lets off a shot at the Imperial Knight, catching Jaster unawares and wounding him greatly. (Natural 20, 21 damage, -1 condition track)
********************************************************************************
Ruhsk looks around, a hand straying under the table as the fight breaks out, but he doesn't take his eyes off of Kurr. Again he smiles, the pair of criminals seemingly at home in this kind of atmosphere.
**"She's got maybe a trick or two up her sleeve, you'll find out once you sign the contract. Master Rav, in his infinite mercy, will allow you to pay 10% of the total every month, and its to be immediately taken out of your cut whenever he calls on you for a job."**
The Aqualish taps the datapad with a thick finger, sending it sliding across the table into Kurr's lap. Kurr doesn't recognize all of the legalese used within the contract, but he understands enough to know that the contract contains some outrageously stiff penalties.
Standard for these kinds of deals.
**"Skip out on a payment, or kriff it up like last time and you'll *become* poodoo, we'll see to that! Now sign the karkin' thing so I can get out of this nerfhouse!"**
Ruhsk leans back in his seat, the chair protesting against his girth, but his hand remains under the table, likely clutching a blaster that is probably more trained on the Feeorin than the participants of the blasterfight.
********************************************************************************
Two of the spies move to intercept the charging Al'verde, both drawing combat knives as they go. One, a tall red-haired woman with the frown lines of a person that never smiles, goes low for the Mandalorian's groin, while the other, a short man wearing a maniacal grin, aims for his throat.
Al'verde barely manages to shunt the woman aside with his mesh tape, while the man's combat knife sends a shower of sparks into the air as it scrapes along the Mandalorian's helmet. Both set themselves in combat stances, showing some military training, and await Al'verde's next move.
********************************************************************************
Weakened, near-blind, and naked, Wes manages to crawl to the tables holding his armor and weapons, feebly scrabbling up onto his knees to retrieve his carbine. His eyes refuse to focus, but what he can make out is chaos: Two humans squaring off against a Mandalorian; a pair of armored Jedi wielding silver lightsabers, one being accosted by another man wielding a blaster; the blonde-haired woman now chasing the Ithorian around the casket; and a Feeorin and Aqualish conversing rather calmly through it all.
Little by little, the Mandalorian feels strength returning to his stiff limbs, but with it comes the burn of blood being forced through vessels long inactive. While his legs still offer betrayal, his trigger finger is beginning to feel just fine.
********************************************************************************
**"What the Kriff do you mean, Davik?! Bring me that Karkin' hammerhead, or I'm going to hang you by your nadgers until they pop off! I'm sending reinforcements!"**
The commlink rudely, and rather abruptly cuts out on the Zeltronian and he finds himself rather alone in the middle of the chaos. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the same naked youth that had occupied the casket, but now he's crawled to the table holding those goods that didn't sell at auction. Amongst them is a blaster carbine, which the youth snatches up in a faltering grip.
He's turning to aim...
********************************************************************************
**"No one threatensss the missstresss!"**
The Barabel turns from firing on the oubliette to Kanos, and lets out a hiss of outrage. With a frighteningly fast spin, the mercenary whips his tale at the Zabrak, the appendage making a whip-cord crack.
The tip of the tail catches Kanos on his cheek, drawing a sharp line of blood and causing the Zabrak to lose his aim. Hissing menacingly, the Barbel tosses his blaster rifle aside, flexing wickedly sharp claws that seem intent on rending the hapless security guard.
********************************************************************************
Nestil's proclamation draws a sinister sneer from the lovely blonde, but she maintains her focus on the Ithorian. The noble Imperial Knight doesn't have far to go, as the spy that shot Jaster turns to her, his face a mask of pure hatred.
Nestil brings her lightsaber to bear, but the man seems undaunted in the face of two Imperial Knights.
********************************************************************************
**"Damn you Jedi scum, hold still!"**
The blond woman continues to chase the Ithorian around the crystal casket, the scene appearing somewhat childish and comical if the woman weren't so intent on doing the Ithorian harm. Finally, the blonde manages to corner the Ithorian, but once again showing miraculous dexterity, or perhaps a desperate need to remain alive, he manages to roll away at the last minute.
**"Six Hundred-Thousand to whoever saves me! Oh please help!"**
With that, the Ithorian begins a dead sprint for the beaded-curtain door.

Kanos took a step back when the Barabel attacked him. *Oh, I should've known this was going to happen.* Almost immediately, Kanos dropped his carbine and drew his heavy blaster. "Frak it," as he hit the comlink again. *"This is Agent Odaska in the Wheel Within a Wheel Casino. We have blaster fire and Imperials causing mayhem. Require immediate backup,"* Kanos yelled as he fired his heavy blaster at the Barabel. *Karkin' fool shouldn't have taken the bribe.*
Kanos did a quick look around after he fired, checking to see if the woman was still there. *Definetely a bad day for doing guard work.*

Nestil didn't seem terribly concerned about the spy that attacked her, Immediately moving forward. "This is your last chance to surrender!" She calls out even as she's already in motion. The Imperial Knight didn't much care who the woman was, only that she was an agent of Darth Krayt.

Kurr's mechanical eye whirs a bit as he looks over the datapad. "*D'ast crime lords and their flunkies*," he thinks, scratching his chin with his free hand. "I don't think Rav'll have t' worry about me gristing up a job," he says.
"*Ya fat piece of rancor poodo*," he thinks, raising his eyes to meet Ruhsk's, the grinding whir of his mechanical eye running quiet as he narrows his good one.
"Jus' so we're square here, while I may owe Kav some creds … this'll be my ship, not his. I'm more than happy t' be payin' him a good fee fer th' flamin' hunk, as well as helpin' him out with th' occasional job, but it'll be my crew an' my terms," the Feeorin says calmly. "We good with that, mate?" Kurr grins a bit, looking into the Aqualish's eyes.
"*Really a shame this Spawn of Nilgarian Worm couldn't trip his way into an "accidental" blaster bolt*," he thinks as he waits for a reply.

Wes crawled along towards the table as blaster fire and curses began flying with impunity. The bad taste of retching still lingered in his mouth as he reached the table. ***This is bad. What the hell happened? I remember the old man and now I'm here. What did he do to me?***
The thought of the old man or possibly Jedi brought on some well deserved anger that has been lying dormant. Reaching the table Wes placed his left hand on the table and with considerable effort managed to make it to his knees. He was having trouble making out the items in front of him. Shades of black and gray lay before him. He blinked his eyes several times quickly as blaster fire continued along with the hum of what sounded like lightsabers. ***Karkin' Jetiise if they are behind this…*** The thought wasn't finished as the melee that was happening right next to him broke the concentration he was putting into forming cohesive thoughts.
His vision cleared for a second and hie eyed fell of his carbine. A grin appeared as his right hand found the grip. The weapon was home, right where it ought to be. Wes turned around and slumped to the floor as his legs still could not hold his weight. Quickly his left hand went over the weapon and found the power pack still in place with the read out still showing a full charge. It's setting was still set to lethal as Wes rarely saw a reason to stun anyone. The grin remained as he looked around to make someone's day become even worse.
Chaos was before him. Several pairs of people faced off. ***So many targets so little time.*** Now he saw the big armored warrior. Wes guessed it was the one speaking Mando just seconds earlier. Seeing that he was squared off against two Wes decided to try and even the odds. He braced the carbine against his shoulder and took aim at the closest hoping he had surprise on his side. His finger depressed the trigger.

Standard to attack Blaster carbine +8 (3d8+8) (minus any penalities) point blank range I think (Point blank shot feat)

Rehn uttered a litany of curses he hadn't used since his days with the Teeth. He cursed the Bothan's furry head and his own incompetence at the computer that had gotten him into this mess. *Why the frak is it always me?*
He threw his bag over his shoulder as he drew his Bluebolt blaster from jacket's inside pocket, his hands fitting on the grip like it was built for him. Putting on a burst of speed, Rehn jumped out from behind the chairs and ran for the door, moving to block the Ithorian. He stayed low, keeping as close to the ground as he could and letting the blaster bolts fly above his head.
If Gil'usa wanted the Ithorian, he was going to get the Ithorian, though Rehn had serious doubts as to his ability to capture the man. At this point, Rehn didn't have much of a choice if he wanted to stay out of prison. That thought didn't ease his doubts any.
As he and the Ithorian neared each other, Rehn waved him down. "I can help you," he called over the din. He was being honest--he could get the other man out of here. After that, though, the Ithorian might not agree Rehn was helping. It really depended on what Gil'usa had planned for him.
(Standard: Draw concealed blaster
Move: Head off the Ithorian, if possible)

Al'verde looked at the two spies as the word Hukaat'kama almost echoed in his ears **"I don't have time to deal with you di'kuts."** As he looked at them he sighed as he pulled out his hold-out, blasting the man that had hit his armor.

Jaster takes a deep breath, steadying his heart beat and dulling the pain from the blaster wound in his side. And then he charges, bringing his silver lightsaber down in a furious slash meant to vivisect the sith loyalist.
The Sith Spy narrowly manages to evade at just the last moment, but does not escape unscathed, taking a wicked cut to the shoulder that barely has a chance to bleed before it cauterizes, sending the acridly-sweet scent of burnt fabric and charred flesh permeating through the air.
Cursing vehemently, the Spy lets off another blaster bolt, intent on doing the Imperial Knight further harm, but the pain from his shoulder alters the shot, causing it to scorch into the wall just behind Jaster. He then limps away, putting overturned chairs and tables between him and Jaster to prevent another charge.
********************************************************************************
**"Well ain't this the nerfherder being choosey. First you ask Master Rav for a loan, an' when he does you one better by givin' you a whole kriffin' ship, ya got the nerve to be ungrateful and make demands!"**
Ruhsk snatches the datapad contract up and wags it in front of Kurr's mechanical eye. As he stands up, Kurr notices that he does indeed have a heavy blaster pistol in hand, a dirty and well-used looking job, but he doesn't seem to be raising it... yet.
**"Good luck findin' a crew, a ship, or anybody'll give you a loan after I get back and tell Rav what kind of lip you got on ya. With no boat, you'll be the sorriest damn one-eyed pirate whatever looked at a star before!"**
The Aqualish then jams the datapad into a pocket, and then the cylinder lock to the ship, before he moves from around the table, none-to-gently pushing it into the Feeorin's midsection.
**"Hell, Rav might even give the karkin' thing to me. Called the *No Chance*, has a nice ring to it, don'tcha think?"**
********************************************************************************
The pair of Spies continue to circle the the Mandalorian, the woman's scowl growing deeper and the man's grin growing wider as Al'verde insults them. Circling like wolves, the two suddenly lance out this time the man going low and the woman going high. As Al'verde attempts to deflect them just as he did before, they change tactics, and the Mandalorian finds himself with a sharp pain stabbing outward from the joints in his armor along his thigh and ribcage. (6 pts damage Al)
Annoyed, the Mandalorian spins, draws his hold-out blaster, and fires on the shorter man, catching him in the thigh. The man shrieks a yelp of pain, and gives Al'verde a look that promises death for their matching wounds, but the Spy appears to be bleeding more rapidly and limping much more than the Mandalorian.
********************************************************************************
The tall woman smirks as her combat knife sinks into the well-armored soldier, her countenance and the short man's doing a complete reversal as Al'verde shoots the spy. Her elation is short lived though, as the red hair crowning her face is forcefully parted by the bolt of a blaster carbine exiting her forehead. (Rolled max damage)
Her tongue lolling out, the woman attempts to garble a few words before she slumps to the floor of the auction hall, as lifeless as a ragdoll. Her companion turns woodenly to see the still-smoking barrel of the blaster Wes has managed to recover, and he lets loose a howl of rage.
**"Kriff you, you bastard! We were finally going to bugger after this mission! You have any idea what I've put up with?!"**
********************************************************************************
Rehn successfully manages to blockade the Ithorian!
...Or at least manages to plant himself firmly in the Ithorian's path, as the so-called Jedi has his head lowered, his eyes covered, and his arms flailing as he bowls right into the Zeltronian, sending both into a tangled, sprawling mass.
The Ithorian rolls over on top of the Zeltronian, his two bulbous eyes blinking as they slowly bring Rehn into focus. When he recognizes the slicer, the Ithorian grabs him by the collar and shrieks into his face, Rehn being able to feel the deep reverberation of all four of the Ithorian's throats from their rather intimate positioning.
**"Six hundred-thousand credits, I'll tell you how I cheated, and I'll help you escape that miserable Bothan! Just please save me!"**
********************************************************************************
Nestil flitted across the short distance between her and the Blonde spy, negotiating the maze of upturned tables and chairs with an efficient grace. The spy turns just in time to behold the charge, and she throws herself to the side, the noblewoman's Lightsaber scorching a trail along the back of the blonde's expensive cloak.
The garment ruined, the Blonde rolls to her feet and tears the clothing off, showing a skin-tight jumpsuit formed of a shimmering black material. She runs a few steps away and takes cover behind the casket, but not before hurling something at Nestil.
**"Give my regards to your weak Emperor, may he soon taste Darth Krayt's rage!"**
Bouncing, skipping, then coming to a rest in the space between Nestil and the fight between Jaster and the male spy, the little cylindrical canister sits ominously for a split second, before it beeps twice and explodes in a blinding flash of light and a piercing noise that assails the ears. Nestil, Jaster, and consequently the Spy find themselves blinded and deafened.
********************************************************************************
**"Agent Odaska, this is security command. Blaster fire has been reported in the Wheel Within a Wheel Casino, backup agents have been dispatched."**
A protocol droid's voice answers Kanos's call, and then the Zabrak hears a beep then silence as the commlink cuts out. As he moves to draw his blaster, the Barabel is all over him, claws raking and jaws snapping. The reptillian humanoid leaves a long, blooding furrow swiped across the Zabrak's stomach, before Kanos is able to fire his blaster. (5 points of damage)
But the muzzle of Kanos's blaster gets stuck on his holster as he goes to draw it, and that combined with the Barabel bearing down on him causes the Zabrak to leave a scorching hole at the Barabel's feet.

Rehn nimbly broke the Ithorian's grip on him and pushed himself backward along the ground, to some semblance of safety outside the door. As he sat on the carpet, his back to the wall, Rehn considered the man's offer.
This man was offering him escape from virtual enslavement here but he would be an outlaw if he accepted. An outlaw six-hundred thousand credits cheaper, if the man was being honest. More importantly, though, he'd find out how the man had cheated.
There was only one way to find out.
*Aw, frak it all!* he thought, as he ran his hands through his hair again. He made sure his comlink was off before he called back to the Ithorian. "I'll get you off the station. I can do it!" *Maybe, if we're really lucky, and not too many people try to stop us, and I can find us a ship, and that piece of Ithorian Sithspit doesn't try anything.

Wes watched as the red beam of energy lanced out from the carbine. With his diminished vision it looked like he scored a hit but he wasn't sure. Seconds seemed to pass as he watched for a result. He was rewarded when he saw her crumple to the floor and lay still as the tell tail smell of scorched flesh wafted by.
He turned his attention to the other that was faced off against the big Mando. Wes was greeted with the angry reaction of the one left standing. "Kriff you, you bastard! We were finally going to bugger after this mission! You have any idea what I've put up with?!"
Wes simply looked at the dead man as he angled his carbine at him his eyes coming into focus a bit more. **"I don't see how that's my problem, do you?"** Wes answered back with a strained voice. His finger found the trigger again.

As he watched the man become enraged over the other dead spy he held back his laugh **"You should have know thigs were going to end this way. You're fighting two mandos."**
Before he could react the man took off after the other mando. As soon as the man turned his back to him, Al'verde quickly fired off a shot trying to trip up or kill the man.

As Jaster cuts at the retreating Sith, the spy uses the butt of his holdout blaster in a last ditch effort to parry away the offending lightsaber, melting a nonessential portion of the blaster but potentially saving his life.
As he hastily flees the Imperial Knight in favor of a more covered position, Jaster calls upon the force and pulls one of the auction tables from the ground, and sends it hurtling towards the spy. There is a very audible *SMACK*, and a grunt from the spy, but the stodgy little Sith rolls with the momentum of the table, and lands behind a non-moving piece of furniture. Peaking around the corner, the spy fires a blaster bolt that blazes a sizzling gouge along Jasters knee as the Imperial Knight runs to flank the Blonde hiding behind the Oubliette. (Jaster take 4 damage)
********************************************************************************
**"I was hoping you would say that… *Mate*."**
The Aqualish barks a gurgling laugh before leveling his blaster at Kurr and letting lose with a blaster bolt that singes the nerfhide of the Feeorin's vest, but does not lasting damage. Ruhsk finally loses his walrus-fanged smile as he finds Kurr not quite dead, and instead he takes off running for the beaded-curtain, vaulting over the Ithorian who covers his eyestalks as he sees the Aqualish coming.
Kurr, generally being opposed to being double-crossed and shot at, raises his blaster from where he's sitting and fires on the fleeing Aqualish, the Feeorin not even spilling his drink in the process. The blaster bolt catches Ruhsk in mid hop over the Ithorian, and hits him in the spine, short-circuiting the Aqualish's nervous system and eternally plastering an impossibly-wide smile on its face before it lands on the other side of the beaded-curtain, quite dead. (Natural 20 on the roll)
********************************************************************************
**"I'm about to make it your problem, you son of a Hutt-Whore!"**
The Sith spy forgets his fight with Al'verde and goes charging across the Auction Hall at Wes, his teeth-bared in a snarl as he shouts obscenities. The armored Mandalorian, taking advantage of his foe showing him his back, shoots the spy with his hold-out blaster and clips the side of his face, leaving a scorched trail of blood.
But this doesn't deter the spy, who hobbles on his uninjured leg in a lurching charge and leaps at Wes with his combat knife. Wes, being sans armor and just about everything else, finds himself stabbed in the shoulder and at hand-to-hand with a man not wholly within his right frame of mind. (Wes take 3 damage)
The naked Mandalorian, having brought a blaster instead of a knife to the fight, lets the Spy know his sentiments on the whole ordeal by shooting the Sith in the center of his frustration. Letting out a howl in soprano, the Spy covers his groin with both hands before his eyes roll up in his head and he slumps to the floor dead... Likely much to his relief.
********************************************************************************
Rehn swats away the Ithorian's feeble grasp, and crawls through the melee between the Barabel and the Wheel Security Agent, and through the beaded-curtain doorway. Outside of the Auction Hall, the scene is desolation after chaos. Chips and cards lay scattered all over tables and on the floor, hastily forgotten when the gamblers escaped after hearing the blaster shots coming from the auction. Wheels of fortune continue to spin with no players able to view their results, and the bar remains unattended, offering its wares to whomsoever is there to take them.
Hot on the heels of the Zeltronian comes an Aqualish Rehn had seen talking with a Feeorin earlier. The Aqualish is mid stride, leaping over the still-prone Ithorian, before a blaster bolt rather rudely forces its way out of its sternum, causing it to flop to the floor lifeless. As the dead creature's head rolls towards Rehn, he sees an incredibly-wide grin plastered on its face, forever frozen in time.
The Ithorian isn't long in following after Rehn, crawling over the dead body of the Aqualish to plop down next to the slicer, panting rapidly. Suddenly, the Ithorian wraps both arms around Rehn and pulls the Zeltronian in for a crushing hug.
**"Oh thank you, thank you, thank you! I thought she was going to kill me! Or even worst, send me off to Darth Krayt! But thanks to you, I'm safe! And I've got the Oubliette of the Covenant too!"**
His head snapping up, the Ithorian's eyes go wide as sudden realization floods him. The hug he has on Rehn becomes even tighter for a brief moment, before the Ithorian holds the Zeltronian out at arms length his voice screeching in a panic.
**"We have to go back in there! We have to retrieve the Oubliette or all is lost!"**
********************************************************************************
The Barabel continues its assault on Kanos, its wickedly sharp claws twitching in anticipation. Sissing in laughter, the Barabel taunts the security agent.
**"Blasstersss are tricky, Zzzabrak. Better be careful, sssomeone might get hurt!"**
With that, the Barabel spins and whips its tail at Kanos again, the appendage making another whipcracking sound. The tip of the tail catches the Zabrak in the ankle, painfully causing him to hobble. (Take 6 damage Kanos)
Kanos, for his trouble, now has his blaster fully free and takes a pot shot at the Barabel, but the pain in his ankle causes him to misstep and his blaster bolt flies wild. He turns to put some distance between him and the reptilian humanoid, but as he does so the Barabel rakes a gash across Kanos's back. The security agent does manage to gain some meters on the Barabel though, dashing through the beaded-curtain and into the casino proper. (AoO for Moving out of a threatened square, Take 4 damage Kanos)
********************************************************************************
Though her eyesight was recovering, Nestil was still partially blind and deafened by the spy's thrown flash canister. But one who may call the Force her ally is never left in the dark, and so Nestil reaches out with her senses and finds the blonde crouching behind the Oubliette, fiddling with something in the floor.
Marching over, Nestil comes upon the Blonde as she fiddles with the recessed controls to a service door behind the dais. Just as the spy manages to get the service door open, the noblewoman brings her Lightsaber to bear, plunging it through the Sith's shoulder, causing the blonde elicit an anguished scream of pain as she finds her arm suddenly useless. (Natural 20)
**"I won't forget this, you Imperial mongrel."**
Though her eyes are clouded with pain, the blonde manages to stare pure, venomous hatred at Nestil before leaping down into the service tunnel beneath the dais, plunging into the dark recesses below. Several beeps can be heard before the service door slides shut behind her, obscuring her from sight.

"I'm about to make it your problem, you son of a Hutt-Whore!" The spy bellowed as he began his charge on Wes. Teeth bared and obscenities flowing out of his mouth he advanced.
**"Come get me then I'm not going anywhere."** Wes said calmly.
Behind him Wes saw the armored Mando take a passing shot that made contact as it passed his face scorching it. It did little to slow the enraged man who at the moment didn't look all that sane. His eyes slid out of focus again and he attempted to blink the fuzziness away as before. It took the stinging pain of the knife finding his shoulder to bring his vision back to almost normal.
With a grunt of pain wes tried to shrug away as he fired again this time at close range. His shot found it mark as it did with the other a lot lower this time but the end result was the same. The spy fell over dead.
Wes looked around again his area seemed to be somewhat quiet at the moment as the big Mando walked to him. "You ok there vod?" He heard as a hand was extended. "I'm Al'verde Verd'yc. We need to get you back in your armor so we can get out of this hell hole."
Wes took the offered hand and managed to get to his feet though he was still weak. **"Vor'e"** he said taking a deep breath as he looked at his shoulder. The wound was not very bad and the bleeding would most likely stop soon.
**"Lets just put it on here and get it over with. The quicker the better."** Wes began to put the armor on as he always did before now. He spoke as he armored up. **"I'm Wes Del-Fin. Whats going on here?"** He asked as he looked around.

Rehn was thankful, at first, that the Ithorian had stopped hugging him. Then the man's statement hit him full force. He grabbed the Ithorians shoulders and looked directly at him. "Are you out of your kriffin' mind?! You just got out of there!" Rehn stuck his head back through the curtain and immediately took it back out. He took one more glance at the Ithorian. "You really are out of your frakkin' mind."
Thinking quickly, an idea came to him. Rehn dug around in his bag and pulled out his code cylinder, handing it to the Ithorian. "Find any turbolift in this casino and hide in it. Put this code cylinder into the control panel and it was seal the door so that no one else can get in but me. Once I have the oubliette, I'll come get you. Now go!"
Holding his blaster close to his chest, Rehn crept back into the auction hall, staying low and hoping to avoid notice.

"Once boss finds out what you did here, you won't be able to comeback and work for the underworld with your face plastered across every bounty hunters' wanted signs." Quickly, Jason looked around, noticing the Imperials containing thier own battles while the Mandalorian and the sleeper take out the last spy.

Jaster summons the Force, manipulating it with his will before casting it outward from himself. The floor buckles, the carpet rips, chairs and tables are tossed aside or splinter all together as the tidal wave ripples outward in a cone from the Imperial Knight.
The poor spy, seeing the damage the invisible force is causing, attempts to anchor himself to the table he's holding on to, but to no avail as the concussive force of the slam shatters the meager barricade and sends the Sith tumbling and rolling before he comes to an crashing halt against the far wall, his neck and limbs twisted as if his bones were made of Jelly.
With the pesky being taken care of, Jaster hobbles up behind the Barabel, the reptillian humanoid appearing enraged as he sees the Imperial Knights bearing down on him, but the woman he called mistress nowhere in sight.
********************************************************************************
Kurr searches through the pockets of the Feeorin, and acquires a new lingering stench for his troubles!
But with a little more investigation, the pirate turns up with the contract and cylinder lock to the *No Chance*, 50 creds, a couple of death sticks, the Aqualish's heavy blaster, and a copy of a magazine of a very explicit nature featuring the Coeds of Coral City University.
A very *well used* copy.
********************************************************************************
Oraltor nods and blinks rapidly in agreement with the Zeltronian, taking the code cylinder and hugging it to his chest. The Ithorian gets to his feet and lumbers off in the waddling fashion of all Ithorians that run.
Rehn turns back to the curtained doorway, watching as the Zabrak security officer comes flying out, although no one is immediately chasing him. Peaking in through the opening, the Slicer sees that the doorway is about to get very crowded, very soon as the pair of Imperial Knights rush over to have at the Barabel, who seems content to stand his ground.
The Zeltronian ducks in and quickly crouches behind one of the overturned tables closest to the door. Both the male Imperial Knight and the Barabel seem to catch sight of Rehn out the corner of their eyes, but they are too busy with the prospect of murdering each other to act.
********************************************************************************
**"Where isss the missstresss?! What did you do to her?!"**
For the moment, the Barabel forgets the Zabrak as he launches himself at Jaster, the reptillian becoming a cyclone of teeth, claws, and tail. The spy's fangs latch onto the section between the Imperial Knights neck and shoulder, leaving a bloody puncture wound. The barabel licks its fangs, savoring the blood, as it crouches and prepares to launch itself again. (6 pts of damage Jaster)
Nestil comes to the aid of her Knightly compatriot, leaping off of the dais and running the length of the Auction Hall, her blade held parallel to the floor. Just before she reaches the Barabel, she turns, and using the momentum from the swing and guidance from the Force, rips a titanic slash across the waist of the reptilian humanoid, scorched blood splashing the opposite wall.
For a second, it appears as if Nestil missed, or judging from the blood on the wall, she managed a mere flesh wound. But slowly, the Barabel begins to topple, or atleast his torso does, as it slides one way and his legs fall the other, neatly dissected.
A heavy silence envelopes the auction hall, punctuated by the whirring clicks of the gambling machines just outside the doorway. Kanos hear's two chimes over his commlink, before a droid's voice speaks.

Taking a deep breath, Nestil deactivated her lightsaber and returned it to her belt. With a sigh, she discarded the robe she'd been wearing to conceal her Imperial Armor, leaving her in gleaming black and red armor. "It looks like you need to practice your dodging techniques, Jaster." She replied with a half smile.
"Where is the Ithorian?" She calls out, Then runs to the nearest exist, attempting to find him. That being had the answer to many questions. "Jaster, Stay with the fancy coffin."

Rehn forks a thumb over his shoulder. "Last I saw of him, he was runnin' away as fast as those legs of his could carry him." He stands up, casually sliding his blaster back into his jacket pocket. He pulls out his id and flashes it toward the Knights. "I work here and I have to collect that oubliette until it is paid for."
He strides down to the dais, looking the casket over. *Now how do I get it out of here?* he wondered, as he looked for a hovercart, elevator or any other method of moving it.

OOC: Jumping a bit ahead of any conversation that Al'verde and Wes have.
Sitting against the table Wes clipped the last piece of black and gray armor on and then slid the helmet over his head. Just as it did every time the HUD came up and ran its diagnostic routine. Seconds later it beeped that all was functioning within operational parameters. The movements of putting on his armor had made his muscles ache. The bad thing was that they hurt, good thing was that they were responding somewhat like they should. It would be a little bit till he got back to full strength. Lastly he grabbed his carbine and stood.
Wes looked around again. The damage caused by the fight had reorganized the furniture somewhat from the looks of it. ***Looks like the place has been improved.*** His vision was mostly cleared now and he could see the others in the room. Two humans in red armor one with a deactivated lightsaber in his hand. Al'verde, a Feeorin, a Zabrak and a Zeltron were also present. Questions were asked. Ones he didn't know the answer to. Of course he had a few of his own that he was burning to ask. The main one being, what was he doing here. ***Something has happened to me. I just have to figure out what.*** He thought.
The Zeltron pulled ID and flashed it to the Jetii. Wes heard him speak. "I work here and I have to collect that oubliette until it is paid for." At the mention of the oubliette Wes looked it over. He looked down and saw the pool of bile and whatever else was in his stomach that he brought up when he fell out. Wes walked over to where the Zeltron stood looking at the coffin he had been in. He looked at the alien that was not far from him. **"Interesting. Now that it's empty what happens? Will they come to collect me? That could be a problem. Maybe you could tell me why I was, I think, about to be bought"** Wes stood there looking at Rehn. Carbine in hand thought it wasn't pointed at anyone it was a reminder that there was a well armed Mando in the place. One that may not be too happy about his current situation.

Rehn glanced over at the Mandalorisn and shrugged. "You were supposed to be an ancient--and very dead--king. As for what happens now, well, that's up to my boss, Sheffro Gil'usa. I don't think he's much into slave trade, if that's what your asking." *He just blackmails criminals into indefinitely working for him in exchange for avoiding prison. But no, definitely no slavery.*
"Help me get this thing outta here and I'll help you. I can help you find out what you were doing in that frakkin' thing, since you don't seem to know, yourself." In truth, he wasn't so sure about his slicing capabilities or if the oubliette could really reveal such a thing, but he was hoping the Mando would give him some protection against the Imperial Knights if they tried to stop him, since they seemed as eager to find the Ithorian as the blonde had been.
Aw, what the frak was he doing? He was going to get himself killed helping that Ithorian. Still, his curiosity had gotten the better of him and he was now determined to find out what was so important about this crystal casket.

The Zeltron tried to answer his question. It was a good start as it didn't get him killed. "...Sheffro Gil'usa. I don't think he's much into slave trade, if that's what your asking."
Wes looked at the Zeltron. **"Good to know because I would be a slave to no one."** Wes saw the Jetii advance on them his lightsaber still in his hand. The alien continued. "Help me get this thing outta here and I'll help you. I can help you find out what you were doing in that frakkin' thing, since you don't seem to know, yourself."
Wes nodded his head. ***Answers would be good. He'll be useful for now.*** Wes was about to ask a question but the Jetii interrupted him. "Where do you think your going to take the Oubliet?" The red armor stood out as he blocked their avenue to leave. "Why the hurry to get out of here if you work here?" He finished.
Wes looked the Jetii over. ***Red armor and a lightsaber.*** Wes then noticed the Imperial symbol emblazoned on the armor. ***Jetii and the Imps working together. What's going on here?***  Wes nodded at the armored individual. **"Just like a Jetii to be into something. Your order must really be slumming if you're working with the Imps now."** With the Jedi around it made Wes think of the old man before he blacked out. He was beginning to get a bad feeling about this and he and bad feelings didn't go well together.

As Kurr crosses deeper into the Wheel Within the Wheel from the auction hall, he hears a rustling noise coming from behind the bar. The closer the Feeorin gets, the louder the rustling becomes, and he also hears a hushed voice talking to itself.
**"Oh… This'a good one. Yeah, yeah! This'll sell for… like… a lot! Naxy really hit the Jack-kettle today!"**
Peering over the counter of the bar, Kurr finds a Sakiyan rooting through the unguarded liquor bottles pocketing and tasting the most expensive stuff he can find. As of the moment, Naxy Skreeger is unaware he is being watched.
********************************************************************************
Nestil runs through the gaming floor of the Casino, towards the entrance as that is the only exit she is aware of. Looking out the sliding-glass doors, the Imperial Knight can see a squad of troopers making their way towards the Casino with all due haste. Judging from their mismatched equipment and attire, and their ragged pace, the noblewoman can surmise that they are likely mercenaries, and what passes for the Casino's security.
Off to her right, are a row of elevators that lead to the varying levels of the Wheel Within the Wheel. Most of the elevators read as green with their doors open, signaling their readiness for use, but two are coming down from the upper floors, and oddly enough the indicator above one flashes red and out of order.
********************************************************************************
The Zeltronian continues to scour the Auction Hall for anything that would aid him in absconding with the Oubliette. Underneath the tables the formerly held the Mandalorian's gear are a series of repulsor pads, used to help auction winners haul their larger items. Rehn would surmise that it would take two of the pads to strap down the oubliette and carry it in a secure fashion.
While the slicer and the Mandalorian are arguing with the Imperial Knight, Rehn receives an urgent series of blips on his commlink, showing someone attempting to force a communication through. If he looks down, he will see that it is Gil'usa, who has been trying to contact the Zeltron multiple times since the last time they spoke. This is not likely to be a happy conversation.
To Jaster, the Zeltronian's argument seems very plausible, but it doesn't change his demeanor towards the man in the slightest. **(Deception roll did not beat Will, continue to act as normal)**

Wes smiled beneath his helmet when he saw the man before him begin to bristle. It was always so easy to rile the Jetii. "Jetii??? Do you mean Jedi? I'm not a Jedi. I'm an Imperial Knight" Wes raised an eyebrow at the Imperial Knight comment. It didn't matter. *'A spade is a spade.'* His father always used to say. To Wes the man in front of him was still a Jedi but in flashy armor.
***"Either way things have changed. Question is which way did it go.?*** The Knight still stood there barring their way. "What year do you think it is Mandalorian?"
Wes looked from the oubliette to the Zeltron and then back to the Jedi in red. **"Six months after the Vongese War is the last time I remember. Now I'm here. I've never been here and I've been around. I just hope that that old man that did this to me is dead. Because if I find him…"** Wes didn't finish the sentence.

Kurr wheezes out a quiet sigh. "**Damn cantina rats …** ," he mumbles to himself. His eyes scan the room for a moment, taking in the various beings there. "**Oy**," he says to the Sakiyan, "**There any lum down there, mate? If so, could ya spare a bottle for a parched space-hound?**"
"**Wonder if those dwarfnuts are done shooting up the auction hall, or if station sec has hauled them out an airlock yet ..**" he ponders.

The Jedi had a lot to say to him and the Zeltron though Wes only paid attention to what was said to him. "I doubt the old man who did this to you is still around. Quite a bit of time has passed since then." The Knight said.
Wes simply looked at the Jedi or Imperial Knight as he called himself. In Wes's mind they were of the same cloth. Force users with lightsabers. ***You could've told me how much time has passed at least. Is it years, decades?***
Wes turned to the side looking back at Al'verde. Wes knew many of the Mando's that were involved in the war. He didn't recognize the big one that stood there. The Knights voice when it addressed him again caused him to turn back around. "Who are you? It would appear that three factions in a bit of a war may want you or just the Oubliette. Can't really tell at the moment. So it begs the question. Are you important for something?"
A half snort/chuckle was heard from Wes. **"They can have what ever this thing is, oubliette or whatever its called. Now that I'm not in it I don't care. As for who I am I'm just a mercenary who was looking for work and ended up in that."** Wes said as he pointed his left hand at what was his coffin. Till he knew more he decided to leave out any more information about the old man and what his suspicions about him were. At the moment it was too much to wrap his head around till he had a chance to get some rest.

Naxy nearly jumps out of his skin as Kurr's booming voice sounds behind him. The Sakiyan spins around quickly in a defensive crouch, clutching the various bottles of booze to his chest as would a mother Gundark protecting her young.
**"Hhhhhhhhhhhh-Hi! I, uh, was just, uh, holdin' onto this stuff for… whadyasay… Safe book keeping!"**
Naxy tries his best innocent grin, which is mostly ruined by his cowering and twitchiness. With his eyes locked on the Feeorin, he roots around with one hand, almost blindly, before coming up with a bottle of Lum which he thrusts at Kurr.

Kurr grins lopsidedly as he snags the bottle. Being in unusual good spirits, he toss ten credits from his newly "acquired" wealth to the Sakiyan. "**Ahh … thanks, Mate … much obliged**," he says, spinning on one heel from the bar and heading to the auction room. "**Now, let's see what other trouble has been brewin' in th' last few minutes, eh?**" he says to himself, bottle in one hand, blaster still in the other.

Intentionally ignoring the Knight's questions, Rehn answers his comlink. "Whattya need, *boss*?" he says, emphasizing that word for the Knight's benefit.
An interesting idea popped into his head: maybe he should hand the comlink over to the Knight and let him get yelled at. Rehn immediately thought better of it. Gil'usa would probably reveal something he didn't want revealed. Like the Ithorian.
He flashes a broad smile at the Knight then quietly moves over to the repulsor pads. Hopefully those Mandos could keep the Knight busy for awhile--or at least long enough for him to get the oubliette out of the room.

I would rather not let the Sith have either. They are not too kind to things they covet."** Looks at the Zeltron **"You didn't answer my questions?

It would be helpful to know what the Sith want and you may know enough to clue us in."** Jaster turns off his saber and clips it to his belt, but remains between the Zeltron and the Oubliette. **"Maybe we should continue this conversation someplace more private."** Jaster suggests trying to remain calm.

Wes listened as Al'verde stepped up beside him and backed him up. The Zeltron was talking on his comm as he seemed like he wanted to be somewhere, anywhere other than here. The Jedi was talking again. ***This one likes to talk a lot doesn't he?*** Wes thought. He relaxed inside his armor as the Knight said he wasn't going to force him to go anywhere.
As it was the Knight looked pretty banged up. If it escalated He was pretty sure that he could prevent the knight from trying to stop him. Besides he had Al'verde standing there with him to back him up. Answers. The knight wanted them as did he but would he get them?
Wes focused back on him as he finished speaking, "...Maybe we should continue this conversation someplace more private."
They all heard him sigh frustratedly. **"Look I want answers also. I don't know where I am or what I'm doing here. Hell I don't even know when I am. People want me and or this karkin' box here.

**"Agent Odaska, Wheel Security Forces are inbound and will be to your location in less than five minutes. Due to the nature of the disturbance, lethal force is advised should perpetrators refuse to stand down. Wheel Central Command out."**
Kanos looked at the others, his eyes like just partially glazed over as he picked up the comlink. "Roger," he said almost nonchalantly, "better have the morgue know that the bodies are also going to have to be taken care." Kanos looks around, then mentally says frak it. "One barabel, one Aqualish," *wasn't he talking to a Feeorion,* Kanos, wondered, "and three humans. Looks liken Darth Krayt wanted something."
Kanos half listened to the casket's late occupant as the guy put his gear on. *Great, a Mandalorian*, Kanos thought as he looked up at them and the Imperial Knight. Sighing, Kanos walked forward, putting his blaster away.
"Normally I wouldn't even talk to Imperials," Kanos said. "Especially since you frakkers started the war." Kanos then spitted on barabel, "but I know you Imperial Knights were betrayed as well." Kanos put his hand. "Thanks for the help. Right now, security is going to be coming through here like a fraking bat out of hell. I suggest you and you partner go find the fraking Sith whore* and shove her out an air lock. I can't garrauntee that I can keep security off you long."
Kanos then looked at the Mandalorians. "You two, I recommend staying.

"You also stay here, if for no other reason than to help sleeping beauty here."
Kanos looked over at the Zeltron. "Hey, you know where that Ithorian went?" Kanos then narrowed his. "And don't I know you?"

The Sakiyan goes back to stuffing whatever space he can find with the unattended liquor as the pirate turns and goes about his business.
Kurr swaggers past the Zabrak security officer that he had seen fighting earlier. Passing through the beaded-curtain doorway, the Feeorin is greeted by this scene: The two mandalorians, the naked one now fully dressed, squaring off in a debate with the male Imperial Knight, while a Zeltronian is behind them, trying too hard to ignore the other three while casing the crystalline casket.
********************************************************************************
Nestil stretches out with the Force, gaining sight beyond sight as her senses expand to encompass the casino's gambling floor, and some floors above.
In the pair of elevators coming down to her location, she sees two squads of mercenaries, one to each elevator car, a particularly well-dressed Bothan in the center of one. The mercenaries, likely more of the casino's personal security, are checking weapons and look particularly armed to the teeth.
And then sitting in the center of the elevator that is apparently out of order is the Ithorian, his knees drawn up to his chest and his head down. He appears to be waiting for something, or someone.
********************************************************************************
**"What do I need? What do I need?!! I need you to answer your Sithspittin' commlink when I call you. But, you'll not have to worry about that ever again, because when I get down there I'm going to have everyone I find alive pumped full of molten durasteel while I'm dipping them in acid.

The Bothan sounded incredibly cheerful, in a manically homicidal sort of way, just before Rehn's commlink kicks out.

Kurr pops the bottle of lum open and takes a swig. Seeing as how the chaos has mellowed, he slides his blast back into its holster as he walks past the Zabrak and nods a bit towards him as he wanders past. Looking around the room, he notes the mixture of Imperial Knights and Mandies. "***Uf … there's a mixture that could pop in yer face***," he thinks. He looks over the oubliette and again to the Mandies, a sly grin slipping across his mouth. "***On th' other hand, they have some uses as well.***" He takes another swig and begins moving towards the group, paying a moment of attention to the Zelton with the nervous look. "**Huh, looks like someone's not having a good day,**" he says with a smirk.

Gil'usa's voice was unnecessarily loud in Rehn's ear, forcing the Zeltron to pull the comlink away from his head. The rest of the Bothan's message sounded a bit tinny because of it, but he got the point--when Gil'usa got here, he was a dead man. His nerves jumped wildly, and he forced himself to take a deep breath, to calm down.
He turned back to the others, clearly rattled. "Oh frak." He rubbed his cybernetic hand over his face and closed his eyes briefly as he considered what to do next. It was simple, really, if he wanted to get out of here with all his remaining limbs attached. "I, uh, I know where the Ithorian is," he announced. "Help me get this blasted casket outta here and I'll, um, bring you to him."
Without waiting to hear if they would help him, he started strapping the oubliette to the repulsor pads.

A Zabrek walked forward now. Wes just closed his eyes. ***Great here come another one.*** He thought as he came to a stop between himself and the Knight but just off to the side. He didn't waste any time with chit chat. "Normally I wouldn't even talk to Imperials, especially since you frakkers started the war." Wes looked at the Zabrek. "But I know you Imperial Knights were betrayed as well." his hand was offered as he also told him to go find the Sith lady. Sound advice Wes would have agreed if he's been asked.
Next Wes found himself looking at the Zabrek as he spoke to him and Al'verde. Wes shifted a bit as his legs were tired. He need some rest and soon. He wasn't sure how long he would be able to keep this up. "You two, I recommend staying. You," He pointed at Wes, "don't know the rules and regulations, plus you been out for a long time if what you're telling me is true. At least a good hundred years." Wes didn't hear what was said to Al'verde after that.
***One hundred years. Why? Why did this happen? What did that old man mean when he said that I had unknown potential and would be needed in the future? And there's a war going on, so what. There's always a war going on that will never change.***
So lost in thought Wes missed the Feeorin walk in. He was still stunned from hearing that he had been in that coffin for a hundred years. He shook his head to clear it. As he did so he noticed the Zeltron pull the comlink from his head. Watching him Wes could see that he was rattled. Whatever was said on the other side of that comlink had the alien scared. So scared in fact he played his cards quickly as he confirmed he knew where the Ithorian was. "Help me get this blasted casket outta here and I'll, um, bring you to him."
Wes looked at Al'verde and nodded. **"I need to find out more. Why I was put in that thing and more importantly why I'm here. So much has happened I need answers. Problem is each answer brings two more questions. Will you help me Vod."**
Wes waited a moment for an answer and then moved to the Zeltron. **"I'm Wes Del-Fin. I'll help you get this thing out of here. that Ithorian has answers I need."** He reached for one of the repulsor pads. **"Where we taking it?"** Wes didn't know where he was going or how he would get there but staying here in the auction area was not an option.

When the Mando came over to assist him, Rehn didn't stop him. "My name's Rehn. And we . . . we're taking it as far out of here as we can get."
He nervously glanced toward the door, expecting Gil'usa's thugs to walk in at any second. As they strapped the oubliette to the repulsor pads, Rehn couldn't stop his hands from shaking. Why in the name of the Sith was he not running from this place like the hounds of Alkeron were on his heels? His karking curiosity, that's why. He wanted to know where Wes had come from almost as much as Wes did. Well, maybe, not *that* much.
When the Knight came over to help, Rehn was only to eager to have the extra hands. And it turned out the man didn't want to run him through with that saber of his. Well, not yet, anyway. With his luck, that would change. "No, my boss is not happy. I'm taking the oubliette out from under his fat nose!" he retorted, when the Knight asked about Gil'usa.
He glanced at the door again.

Kurr slyly smiles at the Zeltron. "**Well, looks like yer in a hurry, so I guess we'll discuss payment when we put this station behind us.**" He looks to the other help and back to the Zeltron. "**Quite a team ye got here, Mate. Let me just make sure the ship's ready … 'scue me fer a moment.**"
Kurr wanders away from the group briefly and heads to an information panel behind the bar, typing in some information as he looks to see what bay the No Chance is in. After finding the information, he heads back to the group, thinking to himself, "***Ah, Kurr … what situations ye find yerself in. Here's hopin' we don't have a welcomin' committee waitin' fer us.***"
Jogging back to the group, he tells the Zeltron, "**Oy Mate, the ship be in bay 23 on th' fourth spire. Sooner would be better, I would imagine, but we be on yer time …**"

"We have problem!" Nestil calls over the comlink to Jaster. "The Mercs aren't friendlies." She clarifies drawing her lightsaber and doing the only thing she could think of to impair the turbolifts. She slashed though the control panel for the two lifts containing mercenaries. "MOVE MOVE MOVE!"

Nestil thrusts her lightsaber into the controls of the two elevators, and as she does so the expensive wood grain and metallic trim surrounding the buttons melts and bubbles away, while the wiring just behind sparks and briefly catches flame.
The first elevator, the one holding the Bothan, shudders and the lights signaling which floor its on flicker, but then just as quickly as it halted it resumes its steady decline, and will reach the Casino level in moments.
The second elevator, bucks and jitters much like the first, but its emergency brakes kick in and the elevator car comes to a screeching, grinding halt, the signal lights above its doorway switching to Out of Order.
Looking back toward the front of the building, the front-runners for the mercenary band outside make it to the doors, but the Casino is in security lockdown. One catches sight of the Imperial Knight, and pounds angrily on the reinforced transparisteel doors, but to no avail. The merc hurriedly signals over the rest of his squad, while another busies himself with chattering on a commlink.

Rehn pushed the oubliette forward and out of the auction hall, surrounded by the two Mandos and the Knight. As much as that might make others feel protected, Rehn felt exposed. he knew the second Gil'usa got down here, that Rehn would become the first target. He bent a little lower over the oubliette and pushed it just a tad faster.
As soon as he saw the turbolift coming down and the security force pounding on the doors, Rehn immediately turned away from them, heading deeper into the casino. There were other turbolifts available, and they would certainly be a safer choice. Once they were in there, he could slice into the Ithorian's turbolift, he hoped, and get that one moving. They could meet somewhere else--any place that was far from Gil'usa.

"You don't even need to ask. We may be form different times but you know what they say Aliit ori'shya tal'din." Al'verde had said. Wes gave a nod in thanks.
When the pod was ready they all moved out of the auction hall. Wes had his carbine in hand ready for any trouble that may come around the corner. He listened to Al as he spoke again. "My name is Al'verde but you can call me Al." Wes noticed the big Mando's hand on his pistol. "This day just keeps getting better and better."
Wes chuckled. **"Well it certainly can't get much worse."** Wes kept up his scanning as they entered into a hallway where he saw the other Jedi who was at the elevators. He also spotted security who was stopped by the lockdown. Rehn who may have noticed both took a very nervous turn and went away form the area almost sulking behind the object.
***Whats he doing?*** Wes looked at the Knight. **"Jetii, I think your friend is over there."** Wes pointed down the hall towards the elevator with his carbine.
He raised his voice as Rehn was making haste away from everyone. **"Hey, where are you going? Is this the quickest way to the Ithorian?**

Kanos kept silent, until he realized he was hte only one there. "FRAK!!!" he yealled as he made sure his pistol was secured and he had his carbine. "I told the mandos to stay here."
Quickly leaving the scene, Kanos went off after them. *Mother frakker want to frak with me, frak them*, he thought as he came up on them in front of a bank of turbolifts. *Frak them!*
Lifting his carbine up, Kanos fired a shot above thier heads.
**"FREEZE MOTHERFRAKKERS!!! I'M THE FRAKKING SECURITY OFFICER YOU SO KINDLY LEFT BEHIND**," Kanos yelled, putting as much hate and anger into his triade. Taking a deep breath, Kanos loosened up a bit more and slightly lowered his weapon. "I don't give a damn if the Emperor Palpatine himself comes on down from on high to personally say you are the chosen one, I don't give a flying frak. I need some of you to stay behind, unless you frakkers can give me an oh so frakking good reason why."

The female Knight left the turbolifts and walked over to where the security guard was barking orders. She still held her activated lightsaber in a two-handed grip, Her eyes narrowed dangerously at the Zabrak. "Now either help us, or not. And keep in mind, Unlike my fellow Knight, I'm not wounded.

"You apparently overestimate your value," Nestil replies, finding it hard to believe that one dead security guard would do more then get Jaster and herself banned from the station, and the Fringe wasn't nearly as united as the guard way saying. But she did deactivate her lightsaber, "But that's an argument for another time.

The gaggle of unlikely comrades finish securing the casket to the repulsor pads, the Oubliette hovering into the air once the pads are activated. With a slight push, Rehn is able to keep the container moving as they all exit the auction hall into the Casino's gambling floor.
To their left is the Casino proper, an endless sea of sabacc tables, fortune wheels, magna-shuffle boards, and various other games of chance, stretching as far as the eye can see. Immediately to their right is an extensive bar and kitchen area. A slight rustling can be heard from behind the bar, and as everyone is looking, a bald green head flanked by pointy ears surfaces. Startling, the Sakiyan bolts from behind the bar and through the swinging doors into the Kitchen.
Further along the right side of the wall are a row of currency exchangers, banking stations, and chip redeeming windows. Directly in front of the group are the large sliding doors that serve as entrance to the Wheel Within the Wheel, and which currently serve as the only barricade to a squad of 10 mercenaries, whom upon seeing the group begin pounding even more loudly on the thick transparisteel door, and even going so far as to issue quite a few slurs, taunts, and the occasional unruly gesture.
In the northeastern corner of the casino is a long row of elevators that lead to the hotel apartments above the casino, and to the service areas below it. Two of the control panels for the elevators are destroyed, sparks issuing from exposed wires. One of the elevators is halted in its progression to the Casino level by this, while the other is continuing its way down from the upper floors and should be arriving shortly. Yet a third elevator is reading as being Out of Order, a glowing red holographic sign displayed prominently above its entrance.
********************************************************************************
**"Agent Odaska, this is Commander Tarser. We're still inbound to your location, and when I get there you better have a damn good explanation for what's going on. Ol' Pol is going to want to speak with you about this."**
Kanos knows that Commander Tarser is the Weequay head of Wheel Security, and Pol Temm's right-hand man. If Tarser is on his way, then it means that Pol Temm is not pleased, and the Weequay always makes sure that the displeasure of Pol Temm is always well known and well remembered.

"Look, unless you can give me more specifics, lady, it's just security," Kanos said. "I'm serious. If you guys don't let me know more, then your way out of here is going to get severely hampered. At least with me helping you, you won't get shot any more than usual."
Kanos then looked over at the bank of turbo lifts rising, hoping it was the commander. "If nothing else, if you sense a weequay, then you're good. If you're not, then tell me now and maybe I can get security on our side." Kanos looks at the others, trying to guage thier reactions. "If any of you know something, then tell me now."

Rehn didn't trust the security officer to not turn him over to Gil'usa and wasn't about to tell him where they were going. But if he could get his fellow officers to stop Gil'usa . . . "A very frakked up Bothan is coming in one of those turbolifts," he called back. "You want to help? Shoot the Sith out of him when he steps out the door."
He then turned back and pushed the oubliette a bit faster, so that he was running along with it as fast as he could manage. His best bet right now was to get down to the sewers. The idea of trudging through the sludge made him a bit queasy, but it was better than the alternative. Getting shot at really wasn't his thing.

Wes walked along side of the casket. He was keeping up with his visual scanning. At this point in the game, not knowing the place and what was really going on he was even more aware than normal if that was possible. He kept pace that the others as they passed through the casino. He looked around seeing what was there. ***In another time and place I might have been one of the mercenaries that was working security here.***
Wes was listening to the one-way conversation Kanos was having with his comlink. He just wished he could hear the other side. He then heard Kanos address him and the others. "If any of you know something, then tell me now."
Wes shook his head. **"Well like you said I've been out of it for about a hundred years. What would I know."** Yet in the back of his mind he kept remembering the words of that old man. He didn't want to believe the old man was a Jedi or something similar to Luke Skywalker and his merry band.
***Could all this be because of me? Why would the Sith and Jedi want me? He said I was needed in the future. Why? All that's happening here is a war that i know nothing about.*** Wes pushed the memories to the back of his mind for no and began to scan around again.

Get moving they all do, as each member of the unlikely group assembles themselves around the oubliette, leaving the Zeltron to push. As they get closer to the elevators, the taunts and jeers of the mercenaries become more audible, and the thing that they are saying are none too pleasant.
The door to one of the elevators slides open as the first member of the group walks towards it. In most luxury and vacations locale's such a large elevator is known as a being "Hutt Family" sized, and is spacious enough to fit everyone and the casket in relative comfort. Inside the elevator, the precious metal surfaces are polished to an exquisite shine, and luckily so for those at the tail of the group as they catch a glimpse of an elevator opening across the hall, and towards its end.
There is a momentary pause as each band catches sight of the other, those in the lead of the mercenary band staring dumbly at the motley crew escorting the coffin, before the metaphorical light bulb shudders to life, and they begin spilling into the hallway, warcries, profanities, and grave promises filling the air.
In the center of them all is a Bothan of below average height, gaudily outfitted in enough jewels, chains, and watches to purchase a star system and have enough left over to build himself a water park. His eyes go wide in surprise as he catches sight of the group, the Zeltronian in particular, but that surprise soon turns into malicious delight.
**"Nobody steals from Sheffro Gil'usa!! Bring me Davik, alive, and kill the rest! A bonus to whoever finds the Ithorian, partial prizes for each eyestalk! And where the hell is Sherng, he was suppose to have met these kriffin' bastards at the front door?!"**
Gil'usa draws a sporting blaster, one that is more ornamental than functional, and busies himself with his commlink. From the tone of the Bothan's shrill shouts, it would appear he is speaking to the commander of the mercenaries outside of the transparisteel sliding doors.

As they reached the elevator Wes was impressed. He never saw an elevator like that before. Thankfully it was big enough for all of them and the oubliette. As he reached the elevator he turned around to provide cover. Seconds later Wes heard a ding as the doors opened on an elevator farther down the hall on the other side. Mercs and a Bothan they were warned about spilled out and charged for them. Wes smiled beneath his helmet. **"He we go boys, make em pay before they reach you."** Carbine already in hand Wes raised it and held for a second waiting to see who Jaster and Nestil engaged with their lightsabers.

Rehn pushed the oubliette into the turbolift, just as the other one across the hall arrived. Gil'usa and his goons stepped into the hall and saw the others as they tried to escape. *Oh frak.* Now that he'd seen how they were trying to escape, he needed to cover it.
He opened his bag atop the oubliette and pulled out his computer, booting it up right there in the elevator. He pulled it to him and ducked behind the elevator wall so that the others couldn't shoot him.
From his computer, he could control the turbolifts and with it, he could prevent Gil'usa and his men from following. Right now it was their best chance for escape, assuming the others could keep Gil'usa busy long enough for him to stop the other turbolifts from working.
"Keep them busy!" he shouted, as his fingers began to type. "Don't get in here too quickly!"

A cacophony of sound assails the ears of all of those within the hallway as Jaster sends a roiling blast of concussive Force energy down its length towards Gil'usa and his men. Glass shatters, metal rends, and all of the mercenaries, as well as the Bothan, are felled as the ground upheavals. Many of the lights are shattered and those that remain sputter, casting the the hallway in flickering shadows.
All of the elevators now read as out of order, except the one that the would-be heroes are protecting, the one that holds the Ithorian, and the one that holds the other band of mercenaries. There's a piercing screech, and then the latter two elevators plunge towards the basement, the brakes within the elevator shaft protesting the unrestricted fall every meter of the way. Above the openings to each, the holographic image shifts from "Out of Order" to "Have a Nice Day!".
********************************************************************************
Everyone takes to heart the Mandalorian's inspiring words, as they feel his vigor and thirst for battle spur them on. Al'verde raises his hold-out blaster, but the odd angle of the recently-reoriented floor throws off his aim and the blaster bolt leaves a sizzling hole in the far wall. **(-5 for firing at prone target)**
********************************************************************************
Nestil appears to glide across the floor as she sprints into battle, her heavy boots crunching glass beneath them while sparks shower down to illuminate her crimson and black armor. The closest thug to her has just enough time to squeal before he's impaled to the floor on the blade of her silver lightsaber, expiring instantly.
As she withdraws her blade and stand, she sees that all eyes are on her, as some of the mercenaries attempt to scrabble to their feet. Some promise her all manner of death, while others can barely maintain their grip on their weapons they're so scared, but still they rise to confront the woman, a lone Knight against a horde of ruffians.
********************************************************************************
Wes takes aim where his fellow Mandalorian directs him, the report of the warrior's carbine echoing down the hallway and out into the Casino. He manages to singe the hair on one of the mercenaries, and while making the man look ridiculous, it leaves no lasting damage.
********************************************************************************
Both Kurr and Rehn dive into the elevator, the casket gliding in on its the pair of repulsors pads and gently bumping to a stop at the back of the car. They more hear than see the damage caused by the Imperial Knight's force explosion, but Kurr from his vantage point can see the destruction and the numerous mercenaries sprawled around the hallway, Nestil standing in their midst.
Rehn's computer flickers, then hums to life as it rapidly goes through its start-up process. The screen casts a blue-tinted glow onto the Zeltronian's red skin, and soon it signifies its readiness for use.
********************************************************************************
The blaster-wielding mercenaries, being mostly veterans of armed conflict, maintain their entrenched positions and fire down the hall way. The pair with blaster pistols aims for Jaster and Kanos, while the other two set their sights on the couple of Mandalorians. Wes is pegged in the shoulder, but is mostly absorbed by his armor, while the others miss their mark. **(Wes take 9 damage)**
As they roll to their feet, the remaining thugs surround Nestil, who lashes out at one and splits him from crotch to crown with a furious uppercutting slash. Only two remain, each with a stun baton, circling the Imperial knight like a pair of Firaxan sharks.
They each leap at the noblewoman, attempting to avenge their comrades, but one stumbles just as he attacks, his attack going wide. The other impacts the Knight's armor, showering her in blue sparks and causing her hair to stand on end, but nothing more damaging then that.
********************************************************************************
Gil'usa looks up through bleary eyes, from where the forceful impact had laid him. When his eyes regained their focus, he began to wish they hadn't, as he mentally began calculating the costs of replacing all of the items the Imperial Knight had destroyed.
**"Who the Kriff do you Mother-farkles think you are?! I'm gonna chew on your mother's eyeballs! I'm gonna…"**
The Bothan continues on the blustering tirade, punctuating each dastardly threat with a trigger pull from his gaudy blaster. Some of his promises are so vile, it gives even his own men pause, and even though the group knows that most of them are fairly impossible, their spirits falter regardless. (Disruptive, insight bonus to attack removed)
Taking a breath, Gil'usa looks around to see why the blaster fire had ended, and finds everyone staring at him, their eyes wide. With a growl, he shouts at his own men.
**"What're you sithspitting, hutt-kissing, sons of murglacks looking at?! Kill them!! Kill the hell out of them!! Kill them 'til they die from it!! Another one of you bastards dies, and I'll murder you!"**
********************************************************************************
**"Grr… Gil'usa knows the rules. We're still inbound Agent Odaska, hold on as long as you can."**
Kanos's commlink cuts out as Commander Tarser ends the communication. The security officer runs up and crouches just outside of the elevator's entrance, all the while Sheffro Gil'usa issues all the most vile expletives and invectives that he can muster.
A short silence follows the Bothan's kill order, in which the Zabrak takes the opportunity to pull the trigger on his blaster rifle. As the mercenaries return their attention to the conflict, their spirits renewed, one of the stun baton wielders crumples to the floor with a blaster hole in his throat courtesy of Agent Odaska.
Sheffro Gil'usa merely throws his hands into the air and screams at the top of his lungs.

Wes silently cursed as his shot went wide and he was tagged on the shoulder. If he hadn't been wearing the Beskar'gam it would have been much worse.
He saw Jaster to the right. While the knights ability to knock them all down was beneficial, it made them harder to shoot as they stayed prone. ***Maybe they do have some training.*** Wes looked to the secured doors that held the other mercs. He knew it wasn't going to hold long. Looking back to the ones they were engaged with he counted 6, including the Bothan.
Unfortunately female Jedi was engaged with the others near their elevator. Wes yelled loud enough for all to hear. **"Better move your shebs Jetii. You're in the kill zone."**
He lowered his voice for the others. **"We need to get in this elevator and quick before their friends decide to join."** Never lowering his weapon Wes moved his thumb and the setting changed from single shot to autofire on his carbine. A fraction of a second later he fired on the mercs that were firing blasters. With any luck he might hit the Bothan also. After firing he backed up till he was just inside the elevator doors giving him full range to fire from if needed.

As the others fought, Rehn's fingers flew over his computer, as he worked his way into the system. He ignored the sounds of the battle around him, tuning it out so that he could fully concentrate on the task before him.
Gil'usa, somehow, had already locked him out of the system. He'd show that good-for-nothing motherfrakker just what he thought he was doing, trying to lock Rehn out of a computer. He set about removing those few blocks Gil'usa had set in his way, as if it would slow him down any.
His eyes had narrowed and his jaw firmed up as a look of determination crossed his face. He was not about to let that kriffing Bothan beat him at his own game.

Jaster steps back into the elevator, and begins to weave a brilliant cross-hatch pattern in the air before him, the silver lightsaber picking up speed until the air is humming with its energy, and there is a protective barrier of light before all of those within the elevator. **(Those inside elevator gain +2 to Ref Defense)**
********************************************************************************
Nestil's stares down the scraggling mercenary, fear evident in his eyes. At the exact moment he goes to lunge at her with his stun baton she senses a prompting with the force, and with her eyes near closed she strikes, cutting diagonally across the the thug that sends half of him colliding into the opposing wall, while the other other half slumps over backwards.
At the exact moment the Imperial Knight retreats backwards, Al'verde takes aim at the Bothan, but only manages to scorch a part down the middle of Gil'usa's scalp.
********************************************************************************
The older Mandalorian (technically he's about 120-something years old), switches the blaster carbine into a fully automatic setting, cocks the weapon and smiles.
What follows is a spray of blaster bolts that mow down everything in their path, leaving the four blaster firing goons as nothing more then smoking lumps of meat. Jaster hitches his protective lightsaber dance as Wes swaggers into the elevator with the carbine over his shoulder, at the same moment Kurr bucks a shot at Gil'usa from around the corner of the elevator, missing the Bothan but splattering him in more charred plaster. **(Wes rolls natural 20 on autofire, 38 damage, all four mercenaries are dead)**
Gil'usa has apparently lost his bluster for the fight, as he half crawls have runs into the elevator from which he exited.
********************************************************************************
Rehn's fingers are a blur as the slicer hacks the various processes and subroutines of the casino's security system. The security system provides him with some difficulty, but before long he's gained access to the surface layer of the Wheel Within a Wheel's computer systems. He finds that he has access to the elevators, security doors, security alarms, the fire suppression system as well as the doors leading out from the Casino's garage and those leading into the sewer.
Perhaps to the Zeltronian's alarm, he finds that the sliding doors at the Casino's entrance have been breached...
********************************************************************************
Kanos hasn't a target in sight, thanks to the Mandalorian's murderous efficiency. But as the Zabrak turns, he hears a whoosh and feels a gust of air on his back, as the sliding transparisteel doors at the Wheel Within the Wheel's entrance rapidly slide a part.
Near a dozen mercenaries rush into the Casino's breeze way, their ragged shouts and cries of battle echoing off of the walls of the empty gambling floor. For a moment the mercenaries glance about in confusion, before one of them catches sight of the Zabrak and the two armored warriors behind him, and then they all collectively rush forward.

Wes felt his carbine buck slightly as the new autofire setting was used. Blaster bolts covered the area. The effectiveness while not surprising was welcomed as it afforded them a little breathing room on their end. Turning around he let the barrel of his carbine rest on his shoulder as he entered the elevator car minding the protective pattern Jaster was weaving. **"Well apparently a hundred years hasn't had too much effect on me. "** he said with a chuckle.
His smugness was short lived as the transparent door that were holdng back the other group gave way and opened. The others file in as the one called Kanos appears to stand outside. Nastil had already hit the close button. "Frak, you guys get out of here, I'll hold the frakkers off." Wes cocked his head at the security officer. Then looked at Al while indication the Zabrak . ***"Ori'buyce, kih'kovid"***

With the hilt of her deactivated Lightsaber, Nestil hits Al in the side of the helmet, not hard enough to do any damage, but enough to make it clear she wasn't interested. "Nestil." She did answer his question before standing back up and walking over to Jaster, to finally inspect his wounds.

Jaster deactivates his lightsaber as Nestil drags the bigger Mandalorian into the elevator, who manages to clip a mercenary in the knee before being pulled away. The noblewoman mashes the button corresponding to the basement level, and the elevator's doors begin to close slowly.
Kanos turns as if to bark some last bit of wisdom to the group, but a blaster bolt catches him full on in the chest. As he falls before the closing elevator doors, the last image everyone sees is his face frozen in a surprised shout, before the squad of mercenaries swarms over him, dragging him away.

Inside the elevator, Rehn is waging his own battle with the Wheel Within the Wheel's security system. A staccato of beeps, clicks, and buzzes emanates from his computer as he countermands and overrides the system's defenses.

Rehn nods at Kurr's request and quickly silences that terrible Beshniquel, giving his ears a rest. While he's at it, he locks down all the other turbolifts, though most weren't working, just so no one can follow on the few that are. He was in no mood for an encounter with the rest of Gil'usa's goons.
He stays crouched, his computer sitting on his knees, as he idly listens to the other's chatter. He keeps his eyes on his computer, just in case there's something he needs to see.

As the doors closed Wes say the security agent take a shot to the chest and fall to the floor. **"What a waste he could have been helpful if he hadn't been so full of himself."** He looked at the others. **"A lesson to be learned. Don't get an over inflated sense of yourself."**
Kurr, who Wes figured was the spacer since he was the one that said he had a ship complained about the music. ***He's got a point though. Looks like the music hasn't gotten any better since I was gone.*** He used to like music. Not this soft, grating on your nerves kind of music but the loud kind that would make a person wonder just what were they listening to.
He looked at the Zeltron slicer as he thought as to where they were going. **"So my last question to you remains. Where to? I have a feeling we have a ways to go till we get aboard a ship and who knows what we'll find between here and there."** He leaned up against the wall of the elevator and rested. The adrenaline was fading now and his weakened state was coming back. ***Hopefully it's hot meal and a soft bed.*** He thought it was funny that after being asleep for a hundred years that he was looking for some more.
Wes leaned there against the wall. Behind the helmet he closed his eyes which thankfully no one was able to see. He knew he needed some rest and soon as he didn't know how much longer he would be able to keep this up. Subconsciously he was relaxing like he used to do before when he was on a job and needed some quick quiet time. His breathing became regular and his mind cleared. What he didn't realize was that he was reaching out to the Force for that needed rest. Untrained and raw he had no control over it. If he knew what he was doing he would not have done it in the presence of two Jedi. For they and he would know that they could probably feel the Mandos use of the Force. Which he didn't.

He didn't bother to look up to answer We's question. He didn't need to; he knew exactly what he was doing--for the time being. "We're going to pick up the Ithorian. After that, well, I dunno."
He really didn't know what he was going to do--take his credits, run from this station, and then what? He could take it and hide on some backwater world. He could make the six-hundred thousand last awhile, as long as the Ithorian was good for it. Could he really do that, though, and run away from all the excitement of being a slicer?
He let out a long breath, then returned to the subject at hand. "I can pull up maps of the sewers, though if Gil'usa really did have secret tunnels built into them, they won't be on no map." He glanced at Kurr. "Where's your ship parked?"

Wes, still leaning aginast the wall of the turbolift as it continued to wherever Rehn was sending it, half-listened to the others as they made small talk. Unknown to him he was still connected to the Force as he tried to regain some strength.
At the mention thay they were going to get the Ithorian he nodded. ***Good maybe that hammerhead will have some answers for me.***  Wes drifted out again as the Feeorin began to talk. He came back to as the Female Knight began to talk. He began to roll his shoulder, that had been stabbed only moments before, in an attempt to loosen up the muscles that had been hurt. The bleeding had stopped but the blood that was flowing now stained the inside of the black and grey Beskar'gam.
***So the Jetii…Imperian Knights were sent by their Emperor to meet the Ithorian and maybe acquire the coffin in was in, meaning me who was inside it. I'm notliking this one bit.***
As the woman was talking Wes felt the reasuring feel of armor touching armor. Al's hand rested onhis shoulder as he heard. "As for working with Wes here...well you never leave a vod behind" At that Wes smiled though no one saw it. It was good to know that Mandos still looked out for one another.
He closed his eyes for a second as he stood there. "Of course the fact that the Sith were so hot for the Ithorian and this box and perhaps Wes makes me think we are in the right place" Again they were talking about him like he was someones property. Well then again he was exactly that for the last hundred years. The thought of what had happened to him was finally coming into cognition. ***If I ever find that old man he'll pay for what he did to me. Why couldn't he just have left me back in my time?*** The more he thougth about it the more chance he gave the anger at all this to rise
A surge of anger ran through him as he stood straight again. His unknown connection to the Force was now gone as quickly as it came. He looked at the Knights. Though they couldn't see his face the subtile anger was evident. **"Again I keep hearing that the Jetii and Sith were after this casket, and through reasonable deduction, me. Why would either side in this so called war I've heard mention want me? It makes no sense. *None!"*** His hand that held his carbine twitched with anger. As he finished he realized how angry he was and he took a deep breath which was evident by the rise and fall of his torso. ***"I just want to know why I'm here and why they want me?*** He thought as he leaned back again against the turbolifts door.
Even though his anger subsided some, he knew they none of them had any answers for him. The answers, he hoped, rested in the head of the Ithorian.

Nestil took a deep breath, before turning and looking at the Mando. Then she gave him a smile. "Emperor Roan Fel doesn't believe in slavery. So your a free man, who can make his own decisions. However, I'm sure the Emperor will like to meet you, and will generously compensate you for your time."
Only now that she'd given the man close scrutiny, did the female Imperial Knight feel the strands of the Force connectiong to him more strongly then in normal people. But she turns to go and help Jaster with the medpac. "And the fact that your Force Sensitive means you'll need training."

His gaze was still on the two Knights as he was leaning against the wall. He saw the Female named Nestil smile at him. It was a smile he wasn't sure how to take. "Emperor Roan Fel doesn't believe in slavery. So your a free man, who can make his own decisions. However, I'm sure the Emperor will like to meet you, and will generously compensate you for your time."
Wes almost snorted at that. ***Why would this Imperial Emperor want to see an Mandalorian that is out of his time?*** He figured that she was done speaking sine she turned from him with a medpac in hand. He was wrong and what she said next was surprising. "And the fact that your Force Sensitive means you'll need training."
At this he stood away from the wall when she finished speaking. **"What did you say?"** the voice from behind the helmet held a tone of disbelief. If she could have seen his face it would have been confirmed.

"You have a connection to the Force, Your doing it right now to overcome your fatigue and injuries." Nestil replies in a matter of fact tone of voice. It wasn't unusual for Force Sensitive people to be unaware of it.

"You have a connection to the Force, Your doing it right now to overcome your fatigue and injuries."
Wes didn't understand. All he did was what he always did, closed his eyes and rested for a while. Granted he always rested less than the others and seemed the better for it but he never thought anything of it.
Jaster added to the already over flowing pot. "You are force sensitive. You should be trained. If for no other reason than to keep you being your own man and not a Sith slave. That might explain part of why you are so popular."
He shifted his gaze to the other Knight. He spoke and was surprisingly calm. **"Trained in what?** Before either could answer he continued. **"Also you must not have known many Mandalorians since no Mando would ever be a slave to anyone. Sith or Jetii for that matter."**
He stood there unsure what to say next. This was almost the grain of sand that broke the Kryat dragons back.

The revelation that Wes was Force sensitive sent Rehn's eyes almost flying from his head. So there was another one in their midst. It really shouldn't surprise him. It seemed everyone was Force sensitive these days. Everyone but him.
He never used to be fond of them, what with their mind tricks and all, but these ones weren't so bad. They had protected him after all, especially that one called Jaster. If he had to be stuck with Force sensitives, these ones weren't so bad.
Rehn turned back to his computer and, with a few keystrokes, brought up a map of the station and located Bay 23 on the fourth spire. He stood up and placed the computer on the oubliette, turning it to face the others. "All right, this is where we're headin', once we grab the Ithorian." He pointed to another section on the screen. "This is where we are. Do any of you happen to have any experience with theses karkin' sewers? It'd make getting through 'em a lot easier."

"Trained to resist the Dark Side." Nestil finally answered. She was willing to except that Wes didn't want to join the ranks of the Imperial Knights, but she'd kill him before taking the risk of letting him become another problem for the Empire. "I believe that the Sith wouldn't find you easy prey. But they will attack your mind, and will you be able to resist that?"

### **Yogi** (2009-06-13 11:22:32)

"Trained to resist the Dark Side." Nestil answered his question. He shook his head at her oversimplified answer.
**"The Dark Side huh?"** He said back just as matter of fact though she didn't answer. ***So everything bad that happens is due to the Dark Side. That's too easy.*** He had been around Jetii enough during the Vong war to hear stories. Everyone had a choice and it was those choices that shaped the Jedi. Choices good or bad they had to live with them.
"I believe that the Sith wouldn't find you easy prey. But they will attack your mind, and will you be able to resist that?"
She had a point but how many of these Sith ever dealt with a trained Mandalorian Warrior? Not many he was guessing. **If the Sith are like Jetii than they can fall just as easily. I've seen Jetii fall in the war. Jetii more powerful and maybe better trained than you. Jetii, Sith…** He made a motion at the two of them **"…or Imperial Knights you are not invincible. No one is."**
He looked around the elevator. **"As far as resisting I could tell you stories that could make the most hardened warrior take pause. The Enemy showed no mercy which was why the GA enlisted my Clan. We never failed to hold or break a line. I've resisted quite a bit."**
He paused for a moment. **"I have a inkling as to why that old man did this to me now. I'll meet with your Emperor and hear him out. Maybe the Jetii too. Till then I make no promises."**
Wes stood there. For some reason he was beginning to feel like his destiny was no longer his own.

Al'verde closed his eyes and lowered his head as he thought about his squad and how he had not learned a single thing.

Overhearing all the talk about The Force and who's sensitive, Kurr looks to the others and jokes (not to any one particular), "**Ah the mystical an' magical Force.

"**It don't matter what manner o' power ya've got, Mates … don't mean nothin' if yar appointment with th' galaxy is up.**" He chuckles a few more times before ending with the same sly smile.

**((Jaster healed 8 hitpoints by Nestil's Medpac. Nestil, remove medpac from your utility belt on your sheet))**
Rehn spares everyone from Fegrin and the Whispertones as the elevator continues its steady glide down to the basement level. The ride is mostly silent, save the few conversations the occupants share amongst themselves. Before long the the elevator car arrives at the bottom with a soft bump, and its doors slide open to reveal the basement level.
To the left of the group as they exit the elevator is a hall full of elevators just like the one on the Casino level. Most of the elevator shafts are closed, showing that their cars are on other levels, but two remain open. A closer inspection quickly reveals why; one holds the Ithorian while the other another group of mercenaries, whose elevator car Nestil sabotaged with her lightsaber.
The Ithorian lies moaning in a jumble of broken glass and debris. A large section of the elevator lies ontop of him, but somehow its arranged in a way that only pins the Jedi, rather than endanger his life. One of the speakers from elevator's audio system dangles mere centimeters from the top of his head, and a steady stream of elevator music blares from it.
**"Nnnnu nah nuh…. Nanunuh… Nuhnannnuuu…"**
Mumbling along to the song in a daze, the Ithorian's voice is weak, but when uttered through four throats it comes out as a dull rumbling. He looks over to the group through glassy eyes.
**"No more smooth jazz… Make the bad Bith go away… Please…"**
********************************************************************************
Gil'usa's goons aren't nearly so lucky. All eight of them lay in a quivering, tangled mass of broken limbs, shattered vertebrae, and punctured internal organs. Those that are still alive can manage nothing more than gurgled mewlings and shrieks of pain. Oddly, it looks as if most of those bodies toward the front of the elevator car have been stripped of their weapons and bits of equipment. Someone looted the thugs as they lay dying, and then left them there for someone else to deal with.
The last thing most of the poor mercenaries heard in life was the smooth stylings of Fegrin and the Whispertones...
********************************************************************************
To the right of the group is the full basement level of the Wheel Within the Wheel. Directly forward is storage for the incredible number of goods and consumables that such an establishment uses on a day to day basis, while on side of that are massive banks of laundry equipment which are tended to by a buzzing mass of droids.
Left of the storage, and taking up a good majority of the basement level, is Gil'usa's assortment of repulsor vehicles as well as an accompanying mechanics bay. Row after row of expensive swoop bikes, landspeeders, airspeeders, and repulsor trucks line the garage, while a small army of ugnaughts tends to each. In the mechanics bay are a smaller gaggle of the porcine creatures, and what looks like the weapons and equipment of the unfortunate band of mercenaries. On the far wall after all of the repulsor craft is a large bay door that probably leads out into a side alley of the Casino.
In the furthest corner from where the group currently stands is another bay door, although this one is much smaller than the one that leads out into the alley, and its sunken below the level where Gil'usa's collection resides. The path leading up to the small door slopes downward, and on it rests a large repulsor sled. This is likely the path into the sewers.

The thought of letting someone else leave the Tubolift first never occurred to Nestil, as she boldly stepped forward, the cape from her armor gently billowing out around her. Her lightsaber still held in her right hand, ready to be activated the moment it was needed.
She looked first towards the turbolift with the dieing mercenaries. She knew it was partly her fault that it had come to this, but Mercenaries knew they'd eventually die on the battlefield, so there was no remorse for them. The Laundry droids would only be a threat if one of them decided her armor needed to be cleaned. The Ithorian made it, that was good, hopefully he'd have answers to some of the mounting questions.
"Lets take one of those speeder trucks. It'll be faster and more sanitary then moving though the sewers." She offered, in her no nonsense tone of voice. She walked up to the Ithorian, and affixed him with cold eyes. "I'm Nestil Ronda, and Imperial Knight. I assume your the one that requested to meet us here?"

Stepping just outside the elevator, Kurr looks around, his attention being drawn to the Ithorian and chuckles a bit. "**No kiddin', Mate,**" he said down to the Hammerhead, "**That stuff's gristin' murder, eh?**" Looking over a bit further, the Feeorin furrows his brow. **Hmm**, he thinks, **must be some scraps down here lookin' to salvage … or worse.**
Turning to those in or stepping out of the elevator, Kurr states, "**We shouldn't take too long. There're others down here with us, an' I don't think they're handin' out lum … if ya get me meanin'.**" He makes sure to emphasize this by moving towards the thugs and denoting their lack of gear. None the less, and knowing he's no medic, he begins poking through the thugs, putting any living out of their misery, while also looking for any missed gear. **Wonder if they've got some clips or explosives that we could use t' get outta this hole?** He thought.

The relatively brief conversation Wes was having with the Knights came to an end when the elevator arrived at its destination. Which suited him just find. ***If they are anything like their Emperor I can already tell that we're gong to be having a blast of a time.*** He thought to himself. ***Maybe just forgo the Imperials all together and get down to business with the Ithorian and see what he has to say. While them Jetii can be uppity they have nothing on these Knights from what I've seen so far.***
The doors opened and Nestil was the first one out. Wes brought up his carbine and exited the elevator. Upon inspection he noticed that all the elevators were shut down and noticed two were open. In one, the already famed Ithorian, and in the other the dead mercs who have already been picked clean by someone. ***I wonder who did that?***
As Nestil walked over the Jedi Wes looked around. There were a lot of expensive toys just laying around. ***Looks like people still like their toys.*** He spotted the caretakers of said toys, a bunch of ugnaughts. Wes looked at Al and pointed to the mechanics bay. His earlier question to himself had been answered. **"Maybe you can pick up a better weapon in the Vod. I don't think were done fighting to get out of here yet."**
He walked up behind Nestil as she was introducing herself to the Ithorian all the while not bothering to help him. He stopped to her right and looked down at the alien. He stepped forward. **"He maybe able to talk better if he wasn't pinned or hadn't you noticed?"** Wes let the carbine swing free on its strap. Not in his hands it was still a quick grab away. He moved to the debris and looked for a way to lift it slightly so the Jedi could be moved out from under it. **"Someone want to give me a hand with this?"**

Frustrated that no one paid any attention to his attempts to plan an escape in the elevator, Rehn roughly shoved his computer back into his bag and followed the others out into the basement. And that's when he realized he'd ignored Jaster's question. "I didn't have to bring the Ithorian down, someone already did it for me. That karkin' idiot," he said, not realizing it was Jaster who'd done it.
And then Jaster's partner went on to suggest using a speeder to make their escape. "Are you out of your kriffin' mind?! Yeah, it's faster, but every single person on this station will know where we are. The sewers, though frakkin' disgusting, are the quietest way out if you don't want every kriffin' security guard on this station to know where we are."
His tirade over, Rehn helped Wes and Jaster clear the debris around the Ithorian. He pushed off a particulalrly large piece of metal from the man's arm, careful not to let it cut his hands. The last thing he needed right now was to ruin his hands and be unable to type. Then he really would be useless to everyone.

As Al'verde "silences" the speaker, the Ithorian breathes a deep sigh of relief. It doesn't take long for the debris to be removed and the Ithorian to be dragged out of the elevator's wreckage. The supposed Jedi lays panting for a moment until he catches his breath, then he rolls over into a sitting position. Oddly enough, there doesn't appear to be a scratch on him.
**"Oh thank you! Thank you all so much!"**
He smiles at everyone (or what passes for an approximation of a smile from an Ithorian), and even goes so far as to offer Rehn a wave. Slowly the Ithorian lumbers to his knees and brushes stray bits of glass and plaster from himself.
**"Yes, yes. I am Oraltor, Archivist and Historian of… Well, of a now defunct order. I contacted your Empire with a matter of grave importance, but I did not expect Roan Fel to send two of his protectors. I must be more convincing than I thought…"**
Oraltor looks around behind and over the Imperial Knights and Mandalorians, his shoulders slumping as he does not find what he seeks.
**"I do not see the Covenant Oubliette. Were you not able to secure it? Oh no… Oh no oh no oh no… What to do now?!"**
The Ithorian begins to fidget and pace back and forth, speaking lowly to himself.
********************************************************************************
The Mandalorian finds no better weapons, and neither does the Pirate. Its evident that one of the first things the Ugnaughts took when they scavenged the bodies were anything intended to put holes in people.
But, between the both of them they find two energy packs, a handful of credits worth 200 galactic standard, and a credit chip worth 1,000 galactic standard, although the latter is found protruding from somewhere credit chips generally are not suppose to protrude.

Rehn shoved the last piece of debris aside and helped the Ithorian to his feet, with Jaster's help. "Yeah, it would be nice to know why I just risked by skin for that thing," Rehn said. "I mean, it's just a stasis chamber, isn't it?" He placed a placating hand on Oraltor's shoulder. "And don't worry about the oubliette. I got it. It's safe in the turbolift for a the moment."
He jogged over to the turbolift and retrieved the oubliette, pushing it over to the Ithorian. "See? I got it. I told you I'd get it." Normally, promising he'd get something wasn't a guarantee, the way the galaxy usually conspired against him. He actually wasn't even sure he'd made the promise to begin with. The Ithorian didn't need to know either of that though. As long as he was going to pay him--and sate his curiosity as to why this oubliette was so important.

Wes finally got some help and in no time that debris was cleared form the Ithorian. Remarkably the Jedi was untouched and no harm had come to him. With a round of thanks he stood slowly while brushing off the small bits of debris that still clung to him. Wes watched this "Jedi" and his mannerisms. To him he didn't seem like the Jedi he remembered during the war. The Ithorian seemed out of place. As he finished cleaning himself he finally answered the question that Nestil had directed at him. Wes sighed. ***Finally maybe we'll get some answers.***
"Yes, yes. I am Oraltor, Archivist and Historian of... Well, of a now defunct order. I contacted your Empire with a matter of grave importance, but I did not expect Roan Fel to send two of his protectors. I must be more convincing than I thought..." Wes's eyes widened behind the helmet when her heard the Historian say the Order was now defunct. That was shocking news as the Jedi were a strong force after the war. For them to now be defunct meant something catastrophic had to have happened.
He looked away at that point. ***Great. The Jedi are no longer. If what that old man had said was true along with what these Knights said about me. Where does that put me?***  He didn't know. When the Ithorian stopped talking he looked back to find out why. The disappointed look came across the aliens face. The armored Mando wondered what was going on. He didn't wait long to find out.
"I do not see the Covenant Oubliette. Were you not able to secure it? Oh no... Oh no oh no oh no... What to do now?!" The Jedi began to pace back and forth.
Jaster asked three questions without taking a breath. ***Impatient this Knight is.*** Wes was about to tell Jaster to give him a chance to recoup a bit before berating him with questions but Rehn came to the Ithorians rescue so to speak and produce the the Covenant Oubliette as he called it. The name attached to the casket, for that was it was to Wes, raised even more questions that he wanted to ask.
Wes looked at the Ithorian trying to size him up. He spoke a second later. **"Your oubliette is fine, unfortunately…"** Wes jerked his thumb into his chest where a metallic clank came from the impact of his thumb and the chest plate. **"It's occupant is no longer inside."** His voice continued with a mostly unemotional tone.

Nestil turns around and watches for trouble as the rest of the group digs the sentient out of the rubble, and others pull cred chips out of places not to be named. She listened to what the others have to say, before placing a hand on Jaster's Shoulder. "Patience, if we do our job we'll have plenty of time for answers."
"Rehn, To be honest, carrying around the oubliette isn't exactly subtle, and we're likely to stick out no matter where we go. At least in a speeder truck, we'll be free of prying eyes. And if your as hot with a computer as you seem, then adding a routine delivery of supplies to the Feorin's ship shouldn't be an issue."

Rehn's eyebrows shot up on his forehead. "You expect someone to be watchin' us in the sewers?" He paused to consider her suggestion. "And I'm not so sure about adding a delivery order. It's not like cutting down thugs with glow sticks. It's nowhere near easy and requires some amount of finesse. I'm not sure I could do it."
And there it was. He admitted that he wasn't a good a slicer as everyone seemed to think. Sure, he'd gotten through Gil'usa's sysstem, but he'd been working here for months. He knew the ins and outs of the casino computer like he knew its many hallways and rooms. The station was a different matter entirely. He didn't have experience with the system.
"The sewers are easier. I don't know the system. It could take days to crack it. Now, I dunno know about you, but I want to get the kark outta here before all of station security shows up to fry us."
He turned to the others, hoping that one of them would agree with him. He didn't want the pressure on his shoulders of saving everyone's butts. If they had to count on him to get them out of here . . . what if he failed? What if he couldn't do what they asked? No, no. The sewers were definitely the way to go. "C'mon, someone help me out here."

"A map?" Hmm, come to think if it, no, he didn't have one. He did, however, know who did: Gil'usa. Rumors had been circulating for months that Gil'usa had been building secret tunnels down in the sewers. And Rehn knew enough about his employer--his *former* employer--to know that there was some shred of truth to them.
Once again, he pulled his computer from its bag and slipped back into the casino's computer system with a few keystrokes. Gil'usa was never as clever with his passwords as he thought and Rehn had long ago figured out his system. The ones he used for the casino were different than the ones he used for his personal files but they weren't so different that Rehn couldn't extrapolate one from the other. And he'd already figured out the ones Gil'usa used for the main casino and the turbolifts, so it wasn't going to be hard to slice into Gil'usa's personal computer.
A small smile crossed his lips as he once again got the opportunity to use Gil'usa's own plans against him. He never tired of making his ex-boss miserable, much the way Gil'usa had made his own life miserable up to just a few minutes ago.
Now, where were those plans?

Oraltor takes on the stance of one used to giving long-winded lectures, as he prepares to answer Jasters question. He is cut short by the Imperial Knight's second question, and assumes the same pose again, before he's interrupted by the imperial's third question. The Ithorian's eyestalks boggle with the torrent of questions, and he looks grateful when Nestil steps in.
The Jedi prepares to begin again, but when Rehn pushes the casket out of the elevator car, he breaks out in a squeal of delight. Oraltor pulls the Zeltron in for another crushing hug, then all but discards him as he runs over and begins looking over every square inch of the stasis device. The Ithorian is mostly oblivious to the rest of the conversation, until he hears Wes speak.
**"You are the Sleeping Warrior?! This is fantastic!! What was it like to sleep for over a century? Did you dream? You are in *exquisite* condition…"**
As his questions babble out of him one after the other, the Ithorian begins walking around Wes, his face mere centimeters away from the Mandalorian's armor as Oraltor inspects him like a museum show piece.

I appeared that his comment got the Ithorians attention. More so then he expected as the alien began rattling off questions like Jaster did just moments ago. "You are the Sleeping Warrior?! This is fantastic!! What was it like to sleep for over a century? Did you dream? You are in exquisite condition..."
Wes watched as the Oraltor's eyes opened wide and notices a smile. At least Wes thought it was a smile as it came over to the armored Mando. Wes just sighed as he adjusted his stance and shifted the carbine a little.
He held up his hand a question after the third question. It was the second question that got his attention. ***How would he have known I was in that thing for more then a century?*** He looked hard at the Oraltor as he stood in front of him.
His question came out calm and even toned. **"How do you know I was in there for over a century?"** If they could have seen his face they would have seen the seriousness on his face.
***How would he know?***

"I'm not sure we have anything to worry about from station security." Nestil said thoughtfully, raising one hand to rest against her chin, as she started to walk over towards the Ithorian and the coffin. "And no offense, "Pinkie" was it, but it sounds like popular opinion is to risk taking the speeder."
With that she motioned for Jaster to get on the other side of the coffin, and started to pull it over to the nearest Speeder truck that was in working condition. The longer they stood standing around the more time it gave the Bothan and his remaining mercenaries to find them.

Rehn's green eyes lit up as he found a layout of the station buried within the casino's computer. With it was an engineering map of the sewers. The Wheel Within the Wheel sat directly above the main pipeline running from one end of the station to the other. The path they'd need to take to reach Kurr's ship was relatively short and quick. Better yet, security didn't ever venture down there and there were no recent, recorded incidents with anything down there. It was perfect. Now he just had to convince everyone else of that.
He glanced up from the computer as they loaded the oubliette onto a speeder truck. "You've got to be kiddin' me. Look at this," he exclaimed, pointing at the map. "The route through the sewers is easy. No one will find us down there."
He saw his attempts to convince them were having no effect, so he gave up and placed himself in the shotgun seat of the truck, mumbling every Huttese curse he could remember. "And don't call me 'Pinkie'," he growled. "Or I'll reprogram every droid between here and the Emperor's throne to shoot you until you have more holes in your heart than you have on your face." He slammed the door behind him and muttered to himself, "Anyway, my frakkin' skin is purple."

The Ithorian galumphs alongside of the oubliette, fretting over its every bump and jostle. Yet every moment he's not glancing at the stasis chamber is one he spends appraising Wes's armor. When the Mandalorian poses his question, Oraltor looks ecstatic to be allowed to actually share some of his knowledge.
**"I have been studying the Covenant for years! They were an order that existed within the Jedi nearly five thousand years ago, and they were devoted to the acquisition and preservation of artifacts, like the Oubliette."**
Oraltor trails off nervously as he eyes the gaggle of Ugnaughts. The stumpy creatures appear to still be oblivious to the movements of the group. The Ithorian gives an anxious sniff before continuing.
**"More than being collectors, though, they were grand prophets of the Force! Their prophecies were long and spiraling, but it is said that at the pinnacle of each the Oubliette has surfaced and the occupant has played a vital role."**
He pauses abruptly as the group takes a sharp turn, affording them some measure of cover as they approach the row of repulsor trucks. It takes a moment for the Ithorian to gain his footing properly, showing his race's, or possibly just his, lack of manual dexterity.
**"I and my master had been researching the Oubliette for years, and finally pieced together enough to place its whereabouts, but then… at Ossus… she…"**
Oraltor trails off again, his eyes becoming glassy with memory. After a moment of quiet reflection, he shakes his head and clears his throat, a rumbling blast of air sending Nestil and Jaster's cloaks swirling.
**"In any case, in my studies I found when last the stasis chamber surfaced and disappeared, and that is how I could approximate how long you had been in it. I contacted the Empire so I could get it to safety and protect its secrets. Guess I didn't do that to well…"**
********************************************************************************
Its more the attempts at stealth than the actual search itself that takes the longest time, but eventually Nestil finds a repulsor truck capable of sitting all of them as well as their cargo.
Rhen can identify the truck as an A-A9c, Trast Heavy Transport's latest offering in speeder trucks that offer the aggressive style of a military vessel, but the luxury and class of a civilian vehicle. For the Bothan who doesn't care if everyone knows he's trying to compensate for something, because he'll run them over with his big freakin' truck.
This particular model has been modified with electrum-plated covers around the repulsorlift coils, Mynock-wing doors, tinted transparisteel windows, custom reek-leather seats, a nine point Bith stereo system, and mini-bar.
The group begins to pile in, but as they move to secure the Oubliette in the rear storage bay, they hear a muffled bumping from beneath the repulsor trucks rear hatch...

Nestil Ronda breaths a sigh of relief when they finally get the cargo secure, and makes a mental note of everything the Ithorian says. She only nods slowly as he retells the tale of more Jedi from millennium past. Didn't they do anything useful in more recent times?
"You Jedi spend to much time in the past, Not enough thinking about the present and Future. Maybe that's why your Order has been destroyed, for the second time in just over a century." Her voice is still the cool came voice of someone that is in complete control of the situation, despite the true facts of the matter. Its even more clear in the way she moves that Nestil was raised among the Nobility.
She was about to make her way to the cockpit of the speeder truck, after securing the Oubliette, when she hears the muffled sounds. Instinct took over as she immediately drew her lightsaber. In a single motion, she activates the weapon, and swings it from left shoulder down to right hip, severing the lock with the tip of the lightsaber, before drawing back into High Guard.

Jaster helps move the Oubliette as they search for a truck. He keeps an eye out for any trouble as they move among the vehicles. Jaster feels much calmer now that they were moving instead of standing around jibber jabbering. He regretted asking the Ithorian what the Sith wanted when he got a long winded response instead of something concise that he could actually act on. Once found a truck and they have the Oubliette secured he is about to take his seat when he hears the muffled thumping and sees Nestil's lightsaber spring to life. he does a backflip out of the bed of the truck drawing and igniting his lightsaber as he flips through the air and lands to the left Nestil. He points the saber at the opening ready to stab whatever is in the trunk.

Kurr snagged what he could carry of the credits and packs (especially the credit chip) and headed over to the truck when the sabers ignited. "**Easy, Mates,**" Kurr said as the saber-jockeys ignited their lightsabers. He reached to his pistol, pulling it from its holster. "**People er more likley t' turn a blind eye t' a blaster shot then the hum o' those shiny-sticks.**" He motioned to Wes. "**Oy, Mandie, ya want t' provide some light t' this situation?**" Kurr hoped that he got his innuendo as he was motioning more towards his weapons over actual support. His looked around to check how much attention had been drawn ... and whether or not this escape was going to turn into a shoot-out. ***It's just some drunk***, he thought. ***Yeah, some drunk who fell asleep in the truck***.

### **Yogi** (2009-06-17 13:15:35)

Wes almost wished he didn't ask the question. He wasn't sure what the Ithorian was more interested in, the oubliette or his armor. Either way he looked happy to be taking about what he knew.
"I have been studying the Covenant for years! They were an order that existed within the Jedi nearly five thousand years ago, and they were devoted to the acquisition and preservation of artifacts, like the Oubliette."
Wes just walked along side listening. ***Great, Jetii long dead are messing with me now.***
The Ithorian continued. "More than being collectors, though, they were grand prophets of the Force! Their prophecies were long and spiraling, but it is said that at the pinnacle of each the Oubliette has surfaced and the occupant has played a vital role."
Wes looked at the Ithorian as it paused when the group took a sharp turn. One thing he said turned over and over in his mind ***'…and the occupant has played a vital role.' what does he mean by that?*** Wes thought back to what the old man had told him. that he had seen the future. That he would be needed. He just shook his head. As Oraltor continues. Wes heard him mention his master and some place called Ossus, He wasn't really listening as he kept mulling over what the old man said to him. ***You will be needed.***
His focus was brought back when the Ithorian cleared its throat. If they were trying to be quiet they weren't anymore.
"In any case, in my studies I found when last the stasis chamber surfaced and disappeared, and that is how I could approximate how long you had been in it. I contacted the Empire so I could get it to safety and protect its secrets. Guess I didn't do that to well..."
Wes felt kind of sorry for the Jedi. It wasn't normal for him to feel like that. He seemed sad in a way. His whole life had been spent studying this oubliette and what he finds is a out of time Mandalorian.
Wes looked at the Ithorian. **"I have many questions for you. Questions that I need answers to which I fear are going to have to wait."**
He heard Nestil's cold tone as she speaks to the Jedi and just shakes his head. ***Either she's always been a real bitch or its just the Imp in her. Could be one in the same though.***
----------------
The search for a suitable vehicle proved successful as they found one. **"It's about time. Lets get going."** With the cargo loaded they began to pile in only to hear something bumping in the trucks rear hatch. Wes raised his carbine as the Two Knights reacted in what he was learning to be their typical fashion...overreaction.
The pirate seemed to be the cool one as Kurr waved to him. ***Now he's one to watch out for. Cool and collected.***
"Oy, Mandie, ya want t' provide some light t' this situation?" Kurr asked.
Wes nodded and moved past the two knights. He reached out and flicked the remainder of the lock that was left hanging from the lightsaber strike. He released the latch and opened the rear hatch. **"What do we have here?"**
What ever is in there was greeted with quite a sight. A Mando in black in gray armor flanked by two Knights. Wes almost wished he could take a holopic of the reaction.

If the Ugnaughts had been oblivious to the group before, Jaster's acrobatics and Nestil's lightsaber certainly draws their attention. Those mechanics closest to the A-A9c screech and then scatter for the mechanics. More and more gather until there are nearly twenty in all, all grunting and chattering excitedly to one grizzled old Ugnaught that had previously been busy at a workbench.
The older Ugnaught slowly turns around on his stool and slaps on a pair of goggles as he squints toward where the Imperial Knights and their comrades stand around the trunk of the repulsor truck. A guttural growl emits from deep in the grizzled Ugnaughts throat, and he begins issuing orders with rapid gestures. The other Ugnaughts begin snatching up tools of all kinds, and even the weapons they had scavenged from the dead mercenaries earlier, and when all are armed they turn as one to stare in the groups direction...
********************************************************************************
The lock to the rear storage compartment pops and hisses as it comes into contact with Nestil's lightsaber, the hatch partially popping open. As Wes opens it fully he's greeted with an interesting sight: a pair of dismantled droids, on top of which is laying a pale humanoid wearing goggles and a lab coat.
The humanoid is almost as pale as his labcoat, except for purplish mottling around his chin and temples. His hair is a spiked, creamy white that is colored with streaks of the same purple at his chin and temples. It is difficult to tell the color of his eyes through the goggles he wears. His mouth is gagged, and his ankles and wrists are bound, yet in his hands is part of a spherical droid and a small screwdriver. Somehow he has managed to reassemble most of the droid, despite the lack of light and the less-than optimal living conditions.
Turning his head towards the group, the pale Fyrthen glances at each person standing around the storage bay, then returns his attention back to the droid.

"Oh frak." Rehn turns back to the others, completely ignoring the boy in the labcoat. "We need to get out of here. Like now!"
He snatched the toolkit from his bag and ducked under the dashboard. He pulled down the access panel and started fiddling with the circuits inside. *Let's see, to bypass the ignition, I have to . . .*  He rattled off the steps in his head, bringing to conscious memory everything he had to do to slice into the vehicle.
If they had just gone into the sewers, they wouldn't be in this mess. No one would follow them into the sewers. As the mechanics went through his head the only thing to leave his mouth was a trail of obscenities that would make a Hutt seem pleasant in comparison.

Wes looked into the trunk and was a bit surprised. Two droids and something that would pass for a human. That is if that human was pale with purple coloring. He seemed to be perched on top of the droids even thought his wrists and feet were bound tight. what probably surprised him the most was that one of the droids was almost put back together. From the looks of him he seemed fine as he went back to work.
***He's no threat. Now to address the threat that those two caused.*** He turned around to confirm what he had already heard. With the commotion that Nestil and Jaster caused the whole group of ugnaughts were now looking at the group. Each one armed with a weapon of some sort. A few more deadly than the others. He sighed and looked at the two of them. Then shifted his gaze to Nestil who, in his eyes, has seemed to be the leader of the two. Both still held ignited lightsabers. ***Seems like they need those things in their hands to think correctly.***
**"You caused this problem. Time for you to fix it."**
He turned back around and began to reach for the trunks occupant. **"Just be nice…don't act like yourselves."**  He said with a grin that no one could see but could probably hear.
The man was still hunched over the droid as Wes grabbed him and lifted him out being careful not to hurt him. When he was on his feet Wes undid the gag that was in the mans mouth. **"So what landed you in here?** He then lifted his left hand with his index finger pointed at the tech. **"Also if you give us any trouble I'll put you back."** He said with no nonsense. The carbine that was now back in his hand kind of emphasized the last statement.

The Fyrthen was light in the Mandalorian's arms as he came free of the trunk, spherical droid still in his hands. A few loose wires dangled from the machine's shell, and a tiny screw dropped from the casing and bounced under the truck with the quietest of "*tings*". This apparently went unnoticed by the pale humanoid, who also failed to react immediately to being lifted.
It was only once placed on the floor and turned around to face his rescuer that he seemed to grasp the change in his situation.
'Hmmmmm,' he said through the gag. His brow creased momentarily as he looked up at Wes. It's entirely possible that behind those goggles he blinked.
'I don't know you,' the boy muttered once his gag was removed, though he sounded uncertain, 'do I? Ahhhhh, I need Jasper for these things.'
He looked at the droid in his hands, mouth twisting downward forlornly.
'Such cruelty. I don't understand it.'
Ignoring the threat of Wes' blaster entirely, the young man suddenly turned to look back into the trunk.
'It's worse than it felt,' he groaned, 'an hour's work to repair them at the least. That Bothan! I'd see to him! If I could only remember who he was. Do you know him?'
Upon asking, he turned back to the Mandalorian, staring up toward the big warrior's helmeted face.
'You look like someone who might know him. Ohhhhh, wait, you *don't* know him, do you? I'd like not to be trapped in there again. It did start to feel claustrophobic after the first eight hours.'

At the mention of a Bothan, Rehn raised his head sharply, knocking it hard against the underside of the dashboard. "*E chu ta!*" He peered back at the boy. "Gil'usa did that to you?"
He immediately turned back to stealing the truck, uttering vile curses under his breath. "I shoulda karkin' known it! That scum-sucking murglak . . ." he muttered.
He pulled out a random wire and it sparked in his hand, causing him to jump back and let loose another volley of quickly-chosen, four-letter words. He ducked back under the dashboard and resumed his work, more carefully this time.

Jaster calmly walks around the truck with an air of "why are you bothering us we are doing the job your boss told us to do." and turning off his lightsaber. He says to the leader of the Ugnaughts **"Gil'Rusa said for us to bring him his Speeder Truck"** He waves his hand at the leader **"Tell your men to go back to work and to leave us be. You can go back to your paperwork."**

Nestil deactivated her lightsaber when it became clear that the m an in the trunk wasn't a threat. Jaster was already taking control of the situation with the Urgnauts, and she was only likely to interfere with his attempts if she became involved with that. She'd talk to the mad droids salesman when they had less pressing matters to deal with.
The noblewoman then left the back of the truck, and casually walks to the driver's seat and gets in, closing the door behind her. Before she even brings systems online, she dials down the volume of the theater system. Once that is done, she brings the Speeder truck to life.

With a spark and a lurching start, Rehn brings the A-A9c to life! The massive speeder lifts gently from the ground, hovering in place.
...Just in time for Nestil to elbow him out of the driver's seat as she takes control. The Imperial Knight likes her repulsors revving high and her bass down low, as she gives the repulsor truck a testing throttle while simultaneously turning down the Bothan's speaker system. The heavy transport responds with a pleasantly powerful idle.
********************************************************************************
Over a dozen Ugnaughts stand between Jaster and their leader, and nineteen surround him in all. As the Imperial Knight Approaches, those porcine mechanics nearest him curtail his progression with raised hydrospanners and arc welders, and the intermittent blaster rifle.
As Jaster speaks he draws upon the Force, making his words a great deal more persuasive. The grizzled old Ugnaught blinks once, removes his goggles, then blinks a second time. The other Ugnaughts squint with no small amount of skepticism at the armored warrior, but then most eyes turn to their leader.
**"Oh. Well… Ull right… Buck tu work you sluckers!"**
Their squints of skepticism turn to wide-eyed stares of incredulity as they watch the old Ugnaught turn and begin to hobble back towards his workbench. The incredulous stares soon turn into glares of outrage, as 19 pairs of pig-like eyes turn back towards the Imperial Knight.
**"Gil'usa don't let nobudys touch his speeders 'cept us!"**
**"Yeah! And ol' Ivert don't listen to nobudys but the boss! I shuld know, I'm his son!"**
The muttered protestations against the old Ugnaughts odd behavior multiply and grow louder. Shouts asking what the Imperial Knight did to their supervisor, and demands that they get Jaster for ruining the paint job on the A-A9c soon accompany the protestations, and its not long before the near-two dozen Ugnaughts begin a stodgy advance on the imperial protector.

Rehn let out a triumphant whoop as the speeder came to life. Immediately, Nestil shoved him out of the way to take the driver's seat. "Would it have killed you to wait two more seconds?" he growled as he sat up.
He gathered up his tools and dumped them back into his tool kit, leaving it on the floor of the speeder for now. "It looks like your partner just got us into a whole lotta bantha poodoo." He turned away and muttered softly to himself, "And we wouldn't have this problem if we were in the sewers right now."
He leaned out the window. "Hey, you!" he called to the Ugnaughts. "You know who I am, right? I'm Gil'usa's computer guy. You see, we're in a bit of a hurry right now--we have this cargo we're in a rush to deliver. Gil'usa's gonna have our hides if we don't get outta here quick. If you want, go upstairs and take it up with him, but we really need to get going. That's all we want. Please, just let us go." He was letting his pheromones do the talking now.

Callia perked up at the mention of Rehn's employer.
'Gil'usa! That was it! Yes, my employer. Here, see, I have a record of it somewhere...'
He pulled up the grubby left sleeve of his dirty labcoat to reveal a datapad bracer on the arm underneath. It activated immediately once his fingers brushed the screen, and a holographic menu appeared in the air several inches above it. His nimble digits flew back and forth across the holo, sometimes tapping and sometimes brushing. In seconds he navigated a complex series of folders and pulled up a document, which glowed above his arm.
Gil'usa's picture was right at the top. Anyone venturing to take a closer look would realise it was a contract setting out terms of employment, made with the Bothan.

The situation worsened quickly under the administering of Jaster. It didn't surprise Wes much as the Knight, since he met him just a little bit ago, seemed very heavy handed in his approach to all things. ***He's more liable to get himself and the rest of us all killed is he keep it up. Or bring down more security on us.*** He thought as he heard Rehn trying to smooth things but he wasn't sure how it was going work as the mechanics were getting riled up more and more.
He turned away from the tech that he had just pulled from the trunk to take a look at the surroundings. Practically a score of opponents faced off against them. Wes heard the tech talking next to him and produced a holo of the contract he had with the Bothan.
**"I don't know if that will work kid but this isn't my fight and we need to get out of here."**
Wes climbed aboard the truck and waited for the kid to follow. If he did Wes gave a hand to help pull him aboard while keeping an eye on the hostiles. **"You Knights certainly have a way with people."** He said to Nestil. A certain hint of sarcasm could be heard in the Mando's voice.

"If you wanted diplomats, you should have asked for Jedi." Nestil replied to Wes, Making it clear once again that Imperial Knights weren't Jedi. The sooner the Mando figured that out the better he would be. Casually the woman started flipping though the music selections available until she finds something that strikes her fancy.
"Cover your ears." She warns with almost a cheerful tone of voice, as she places her hand on the volume control once more. She wondered how sensitive Urgnaut hearing was, but was hoping the answer was "Very."

"If you wanted diplomats, you should have asked for Jedi." Nestil replied in what Wes was learning was her normal cold demeanor. Keeping an eye on the situation he answered without turning. **"I'll remember that for the next time. At least they can handle themselves and most relate to people normally without that superior air about them."**
He kept his carbine in check. He had meant what he said. This wasn't his fight. The Knights got them into this mess they could get themselves out. ***If this is how this Emperor Fel and his Knights work I might as well tell them to go kark themselves. The Jetii may have been up on themselves but at least you knew where they stood.*** He thought to himself as he shifted the the truck.
Nestil's voice was heard again. "Cover your ears." Wes had heard her tuning the radios controls but he didn't worry. His helmet was would protect him from anything excessively loud by dampening anything over ninety decibels. He raised his voice so the others could head. **"Move your shebs, I have a feeling that she's not going to wait."**

Hearing Nestil, he scoured the area, looking for something that could cover their escape. Gritting his teeth, he started running towards the back of the truck as Wes began to shout. "**Keep yer skirt on Matilda … th' rest o' us ain't in th' gristin' truck yet!**" He yelled out towards Nestil as he dove into the truck. Looking at Wes and the carbine, Kurr asked, "**Oy Mate, ya goin' t' sit on that hole-plotter, er are ya goin' t' lay down some cover fire, eh?**" Deep inside of Kurr, he grinned to himself, knowing that soon enough he'd be at **his** ship ...

As the Ugnaughts march on Jaster, the Imperial Knight lifts both hands aloft as if scooping two handfuls of water. His breathing begins to slow and his eyes close, and as he does the gaggle of porcine creatures slowly begins to lift into the air, much to the consternation of the mechanics. Porkish squeaks of fear, and many more cries of alarm accompany them until they are several meters in the air. Jaster then swiping his hands to the side, as if he were opening a sliding door, and the Ugnaughts begin to draft back towards the banks of laundry machines.
The Ugnaughts don't take too kindly to this though, and those that do have blasters begin to rain a hail of red-streaked death on Jaster and the mechanics bay as a whole. Blaster bolts leave scorching holes through custom paint jobs and burn marks on the garage's duracrete walls, but the mechanics are wild and untrained and their indiscriminate fire does more damage to the mechanics bay than anything else.
But through sheer luck and happenstance, one of the blaster bolts catches Jaster in the shoulder, causing his concentration to falter. The Ugnaughts tumble from the air, scattered, but most landing before the Imperial Knight. He draws his lightsaber with one hand and ignites it, the other straying to his wounded shoulder as he roars back towards his comrades who are hastily piling into the speeder truck.
**"Go! I will hold them and any others while you make your escape! Get the casket and the Ithorian to the Emperor!"**
With that the Imperial Knight sets his feet, and a look of grim determination comes into his eyes.
********************************************************************************
If Rehn's ruse has a chance at working, that chance evaporates as quickly as the Ugnaughts are lifted into the air. The little creatures are near frothing at the mouth with rage. Some of the mechanics begin scrabbling through the maze of speeders towards the truck, but where they make progress a silver lightsaber blade flashes, and charred pieces of tools and weaponry go flying. The Imperial Knight goes about his work with aplomb and an eye for not harming the porcine mechanics, but it is rapidly becoming clear that he won't be able to hold out for long.
Callia's datapad bracer flickers to life, and the contract he signed with Gil'usa is readily apparent to all. He offers it for everyone to see as would a small child a particularly interesting bit of seashell, but the Ugnaughts do not seem overly impressed. A small handful has managed to circumvent Jasters defensive maneuvers, and are now filtering their way through the rows of vehicles, intent on ripping the good doctor a part.
**"You heard the *vod*, move your *shebs*!"**
The Fyrthen is saved, though, by the outstretched arm of a tall Mandalorian, who hooks the Mad Scientist around the waist and tosses him over a shoulder. Wes enters the A-A9c first, followed by Al'verde who has Callia slung over his shoulder like a sack of grain. Kurr is quick to follow suit as he dives in, and soon everyone is aboard.
Nestil cranks the stereo, and everyone is assaulted by the latest offerings from Four Arm-Fulls of Love, Codru-Ji galactic bubblegum popstar sensations. It is their reunion album after the band split to pursue solo careers. Apparently Gil'usa is a fan.

Nestil starts to tap her foot along to the beat of the music, even as she pushes down on the accelerator of the speeder truck, intending to ram though the closed garage door. She hadn't heard this particular group for some time, and hadn't even realized they'd broken up and gotten back together. Apparently her duties as an Imperial Knight were taking more of her time. But she wrote it off as a fair trade for the honor of directly serving the Emperor. There would be time to grieve for Jaster once they were safe, If that made her cold, then so be it.

Once again, Rehn drew his computer from his bag and quickly typed the command that would open the garage door. Then Nestil hit the accelerator, slamming Rehn back in his seat. He looked wide-eyed out the windshield, then at Nestil. "What the kark are you doing?! Wait for the door to open!" His hands tightened around his arm rests and a bit of color drained from his face, making him an even paler purple than usual.
What had he been thinking, getting himself involved in this? Oh, yeah, he hadn't. The thought of the huge payday and his curiosity about the oubliette had blinded him the fool. Really, this was possibly the most brainless thing he'd ever done. Well, right after cutting off his own arm to join a gang.
He dropped lower in his seat and yanked the crash netting across him, fastening it securely. He took a deep breath. *Oh frak. Here we go.*

Callia is lifted bodily by a Mandalorian for the second time in about as many minutes, this time to be deposited back inside the confines of the truck he has just been rescued fromâ€”though thankfully not within that cramped compartment. Throughout the young doctor's unwilling, rapid, and bumpy carriage the light of the holodisplay hovering atop his bracer creates a bright blue-green zig-zagging trail in the air before he is set down firmly. Amazingly enough, he *still* manages to maintain his hold on the little round droid.
'Hahhhhh?' He hums, gazing around the vehicle. Absently, he waves his right hand through the holo-display, switching it off.
Seemingly oblivious to the truck's pick up of speed, the bland synthpop sounds, or the very real danger he is suddenly in, the Fyrthen pulls a roll of tools from within his coat and goes back to repairing JS-PR.

Wes listened to the pirates question about shooting at the mechanics. He was about to answer but then realized he didn't really own anyone here an explanation for why he did or didn't do things. He simply shook his head as he kept a look out as watched as the others loaded in and Jaster stood his ground allowing them to get away as Nestil gunned the repulsors on the truck and they took off.
He watched as the stood there fending off whatever would come. He simply shook his head as it was a waste. Even though Wes felt that the knight was bull headed. His sacrifice was simply a waste. **"Nu kyr'adyc, shi taab'echaaj'la"** He said in a low tone as he turned back around and looked at Rehn as he was screaming at Nestil about the door being closed.
**"The door is the least of our problems. If we don't have a map on how to get out of here the door might as well stay closed. Has that little computer of yours found a map yet?"** Wes finished speaking as he leaned back and rested again like moments ago in the elevator. Subconsciously reaching out to the Force for rest and strength. As he did he thought about what the two knights had said, that he was Force Sensitive like them. He still couldn't wrap his mind around that idea. Had he always been like this? Why didn't the other Jedi from his time ever notice it? What did this mean for him?
Too many questions, too little time.

Oraltor falls into the speeder truck and the door slams behind him, just in time for Nestil to try and put the accelerator through the floor. The A-A9c jolts forward, and as it does the ruined lock of the trunk pops open, threatening to spill the Oubliette and the rest of its contents behind it. The Ithorian "eeks", his shriek matching in pitch with a crescendo in the synthpop song, and he stretches out his hands towards the trunk. Nestil, and Wes to a lesser degree, feels the Jedi's manipulation of the Force, as fumbling as it may be, and the hatch to the rear storage bay slams close, securing the Oubliette and the two defunct droids.
The nerf-catcher grill proves very functional as the heavy repulsorcraft charges into the mechanic's bay door. The door creases horizontally down the middle, and the screeching protest of the door's hinges reverberates off of the garage's duracrete walls, but just as soon as the A-A9c is colliding with the door, its through it and out into the alley. **(11 damage to A-A9c, no damage to anyone onboard)**
With a shower of sparks the door comes to a skidding halt against the adjacent wall of the alley, the speeder truck's powerful repulsors beating down on it. The artificial daylight of the Wheel's environmental system filters in through the A-A9c's tinted windows, but there is little time to contemplate the interaction between light and darkness as the Imperial Knight lets the throttle all the way out and the heavy speeder barrels towards the mouth of the alleyway.
As the A-A9C crests the opening of the alley, everyone within the speeder truck sees a growing crowd in front of the Wheel Within the Wheel. Two full squads of the Wheel's security forces are on hand, and most are holding back the press of bodies trying to gain a glimpse of just went on inside of the casino. The others are leading handcuffed mercenaries from the gambling floor to security speeders just out front.
A pair of the security officers, one a rather large Weequay, bodily carries a hog-tied Bothan between them. The Bothan seems rather reticent in his desire to go into the security speeder, and his feeble squirms and profanity-laden shouts of protest reach through even the A-A9c's thick transparisteel windows.
When the repulsor truck emerges from the alley, the Weequay shouts and points, roughly dropping Gil'usa on his head. Nestil maneuvers the truck out into the artificial street running parallel to the front of the Wheel Within the Wheel, and in the rear view she can catch glimpse of the Weequay security officer gesturing wildly and shouting into his commlink. Two of the security officers elbow their way through the crowd and hop on a pair of swoop bikes. A keening wail follows the security officers as they give chase, the lights of their sirens spraying the onlookers and adjacent buildings with color.
Pockets of pedestrians occupy the avenue, as well the occasional speeder. Nestil knows that it will take some rather adept piloting to negotiating the street while avoiding the innocent bystanders and collisions with other speeders. Not to mention the two security officers quickly gaining on the truck, and the fact that she still is unsure of where it is she is going.
Suddenly, just up ahead of the A-A9c, Nestil and Rehn spy a quartet of HV-7 loading droids carrying a large block of glass across the street. One of the restaurants adjacent to the pathway is having its storefront window replaced. The glass reads:
**"Eat at Jach's! Now with less bowel-devouring parasites!"**
It will take some fairly sharp maneuvering from Nestil to avoid the glass block, otherwise Jach is going to need come up with a new slogan.
********************************************************************************
Callia tightens one last bolt and then affixes the two halves of the spherical droid together. A series of whirls and clicks sound from within the droid, followed by the flickering lights of the droid's HUD display as it goes through its boot-up process. The miniaturized repulsor jets in the droid's base fire up, and soon its hovering in the middle of the A-9c's passenger cabin.

"Hang on." Nestil calls out, Gunning the accelerator. She made an effort to avoid the Glass, more because it would hinder the people chasing them then desire to preserve the property of others. Even as she reached down to turn down the volume of the stereo when it switched to a song she wasn't as partial too.

Rehn was so overcome by Nestil's suicidal urge that We's question never registered to h im. Instead, he had to resist the impulse to wince as the speeder crashed through the garage door. His hands tightened around the armrests and he tried to calm himself with deep breaths. *Pull yourself together,* he scolded himself. *You're getting away from Gil'usa now. Yeah, but you know what they say: Off of Tatooine and onto Mustafar.*
He glanced out the window just as security was dragging Gil'usa out the front doors and then dropped the Bothan on his head. A smile crept onto his face. Served the nerfherder right.
He turned back just to see the loading droids carrying the window across the street. "Yow!" he involuntarily yelped.
Nestil swerved to avoid it, as she reached down to play with the radio. "What the frak are you doing? Watch where you're going!" He was tempted to pull out his blaster and shoot the radio, but he was too busy holding on for his life to spare the hand needed.

The floating droid hovers above Callia's head, spinning around, the lights on its front panel blinking furiously on and off.
'*Flaccid Hutt-balls! Where the kark am I?!*' Screams a masculine voice from the speaker grill, causing Callia to laugh and clap his hands together.
'You're all right, Jasper,' the doctor says cheerfully, 'you had me worried for a bit. But I found your personality chips in the end, and I knew things would work out.'
'*Master!* How truly marvellous to see you well, I feared Gil'usa's thugs would have done for you by now,' JS-PR exclaims, pivoting to look down at Callia as his voice becomes a lot more polite, even unctuous, though it retains distinct sardonic undertones.
'Done for me? They locked me in a trunk, but really it was quite spacious.'
'Master, you really can be insufferably naive! They no doubt meant you to die there!'
'Ahhhhh?' Callia says, sounding doubtful, 'why would they want that after I showed them the finished product?'
'It was *because* you showed them the finished product, Master!' Jasper shouts.
His creator continues to look highly bemused.

Wes continued to sit back in the truck but held on so he wasn't thrown around by Nestil's driving. As he relaxed he felt something strange. It was as if he was having this feeling for the first time. He couldn't place it. He opened his eyes and looked around. when his gaze fell upon the Ithorian he realized that it was coming from the Jedi. The aliens hand was outstretched and Wes could feel the concentration coming from him. Though he was too inexperienced with the Force to know that the Ithorian's command of the Force was not a refined as others that had had training. It was a new experience for Wes. One that lead to even more questions than answers.
He continued to sit there as they ran. The bursting through the doors made him look around and he spotted the two pursuers. This was just getting harder than easier. He listened to the others as he sat there. A motley crew to be sure.
Wes looked at the Pirate. **"I hope that this ship of yours is a good one. Because we're going to need a good ship to blast out of here."**

As he sat back down, his face twisted as he thought to himself, ***Faster we get t' th' No Chance, th' faster we can get off this circular deathtrap***. Hearing Wes, he turns to the Mandie and said with a grin, "**She'll get us where we be needin' t' go, Mate … an' then some.**" He chuckled to himself and thought, ***An' if she don't, well this'll be a shorter trip then we be expectin' …***

Nestil gives the wheel a severe twist, nearly taking the repulsor truck up on two coils in an attempt to avoid the glass block window. Callia is thrown into Kurr, and the two Mandalorians get firmly acquainted. Oraltor slides up over the console between the Imperial Knight and the slicer, his eyes closed tightly either in concentration, or in an attempt to hold onto his lunch.
**"Woah… Hey! Hey, lookout!"**
The tinny, wailed warning of one of the HV-7 loading droids is drowned out by the screams of pedestrians diving for cover on both sides of the street. The other HV-7s turn to see what all the fuss is about just in time to see the A-A9c a scant few meters from where they are hauling the glass block. All four panic, and attempt to scatter in directions opposing one another while still holding onto the storefront window, effectively achieving nothing. Nestil, seeing that she won't be able to squeeze by the block window without major civilian casualties and structural damage, sets the repulsor truck back on all four coils and guns it through the glass. All of the passengers are tossed back into their appropriate seating, except for Jasper who has been amicably bouyant in the center of the passenger cabin the whole time.
**"Jack's going to take the cost of that right out of your servos!"
"My servos?! You are the malfunctioning one, everyone knows you dive to the right in that sort of thing!"
"You're both faulty! Its obvious that the angular momentum of the station had shifted the glass in my direction just when you went all wire-crossed!"
"All three of you must be heavy on the low grade! Mute it, before I take you to the scrapyard!"
"I'd like to see you try that!"**
The HV-7 quartet continues to scream at one another in binary, and a hovering, claw-appendaged scrum breaks out soon thereafter.
********************************************************************************
The two Speeder cops bury their heads as shards of glass bombard them at high speed. But the sharp bits do little more than scrape their armor, and soon the lead officer is along side of the A-A9c, while his backup lags behind.
It doesn't appear that the security officers are in much of an argumentative mood, as the Speeder cop parallel to the repulsor truck pulls his blaster pistol and fires. The blaster bolt is mostly dissipated by the A-A9Cs thick plating and resilient durasteel windows, showing that Gil'usa did use some practicality when modifying the truck.
Locking the throttle in, the speeder cop behind the repulsor truck tracks the heavy transport on his HUD, and when the crosshairs line up, he squeezes the trigger. A rapid fire spray sputters from the blaster cannon under the Quickfire Speeder Bike, but the A-A9c's military heritage shines through again, as the bolts leave nothing more than scorched paint in their wake.
********************************************************************************
**"You *chakaar* don't know when to quit!"**
Al'verde curses as he lowers his window, and points his hold-out blaster out the portal at the speeder cop riding parallel to their vehicle. The Mandalorian lines up a bead on the security officer, but a last second juke by Nestil sends his shot wide.
When Kurr pokes his head out for a peak, he sees one of the speeder cops tailing them and maintaining his distance. That officer seems content to hang back and try and disable the A-A9c from a far. If he looks across and out Al'verde's window, he can see the other speeder cop taking a much more up close, and personal approach as he seems intent on firing into the cabin.
********************************************************************************
The chase rages on, and Nestil pushes her piloting abilities to the limit. Off in the distance, but approaching rather rapidly is a three way intersection that branches to the left and to the right. It is still some bit of distance away from the repulsorcraft, but the Imperial Knight will have to make a decision on which way to turn, and she still unsure of where it is that she is going.

"My Name, isn't Matilda!" Nestil scolds the Feorin, as she silently curses herself for not being able to avoid the glass. But she quickly comes up on the T-junction with a speederbike on her left, and no idea which way to go. So the noblewoman does what she feels has the best chance of taking out one of the chasing speeder bikes, as she makes a tight turn to the Right, trying to pin the bike between the truck and the wall.

Kurr grinned at the scoldingm which grew into an eerie smile as he saw the mini-bar near him. "**Oy! Sweet-Cheeks**," he yelled to Nestil, "**Best b' turnin' this beastie away from the biker boys …**"
Reaching down, he quickly scanned the bar. ***Hmm… lessee … lum? Might need that. Corellian spiced ale? Definitely be needin' that. Vost's Corellian whiskey? Might make a good boom, though a shame t' be loosin' it***. Snatching the bottle of whiskey, Kurr ripped a piece of cloth off his shirt and stuffed it within. Throttling the bottle around and upside down a bit, he made sure the cloth was nice and saturated with the whiskey. Finding a humidor, he took a brief moment to snatch a cigar. ***Ooo … Nal Huttese***, he thought as he lit the cigar. "**Make way fer a meal fit fer a Dewback, Mates**," he yelled, lighting the make-shift wick with the cigar.

Rehn glances at his sewer map, mentally overlaying the surface. He traced the route to Kurr's ship.  *The safest way . . . let's see . . . all right. We need to go left to avoid more security.* He was just about to tell Nestil that when she turned hard to the right. "No! No, no, no, no, no! We wanted to go the other way. This leads to the snobby, rich neighborhoods. Security is tight! I should know, I stole from these people! You don't want to get caught here. Trust me."
His heart was thudding in his chest like the pounding of a Tapani drum. Adrenaline coursed through him in much the same way it did when he was breaking into computers or taunting Gli'usa. There was an illicit thrill to it, though he'd never admit that to anyone, least of all himself.
He found them a new route to the ship. It was a bit longer, but they didn't have much of a choice, now. He relayed the instructions to Nestil, hoping that she would at least attempt to listen to them. If she was a representative of a "normal" Imperial Knight, it was no wonder that Fel had been overthrown. They were too impulsive, like himself.

Jasper spins to keep Callia in sight of his sensors as the young doctor is thrown around the truck. The Fyrthen yelps in pain as both his nose and the goggles over his eyes collide hard with the fully-armoured Mandalorian next to him.
â€˜My, Master, what *have* you got yourself into this time?â€™ The droid asks, in a tone of resignation that suggests these sorts of shenanigans are not exactly uncommon in the doctorâ€™s life.
Callia is now thrown back into his seat. He clutches at his nose with his left hand and scrabbles to remove his goggles with the right one. He pulls them up onto his forehead and tentatively touches the pale skin around his eyes, already bruising.
â€˜Really Master, I know I am designed to take the pressure off with regard to social demands, but I *do* feel that if you tried just a little harder yourself, situations like this could be more effectively avoided.â€™

As the chase raged on Wes sat there in his window seat. Thoughts rolling through his head. There were too many to keep track of, especially now. That was cut short when Nestil made a severe turn, Wes and Al's armors came together. If it hadnt been for their helmets they may have been knocked sensless from their heads knocking.
**"Alright I've had enough of this"** He muttered out loud to no one in particular as he dropped the window on the opposite side from where the speeder bikw was keeping pace. sticking part of his body out of the vehicle wes brought up his carbine on the speeder bike in pursuit taking aim on the driver. Despite the chatter from inside the vehicle he managed to shut them out concentrating on his shot. His finger gently pulled the trigger.

Nestil swerves the heavy speeder truck into the security officer, eliciting a very surprised "Oh Kriff!" from the speeder cop as his bike and the A-A9c collides. Al'verde and Callia are treated to a spectacular light show as the collision slightly crumples their side of the repulsor truck and causes a shower of sparks and metallic shavings.
The speeder cop tries his best regain control, and appears as if he's succeeding, but suddenly one of the thruster coils on his speeder bike misfires and causes him to shift hard to his left and directly into the of a replsor dump truck who's bed is lowered to offload a batch of Wk'ou Melons to a local fruit vendor. At the last moment, the security officer lifts the nose of his speeder and guns the throttle, shredding through the melons and taking the truck bed like a ramp.
The last anyone sees of the speeder cop is him sailing through the air over the tops of several buildings, his head firmly ensconced within a bright red melon.
********************************************************************************
Kurr finds an ample supply of Dilnlexan cigars, some of the best rolled in the galaxy, and a vintage Corellian Whiskey. It isn't long before he has his fiery surprise all prepared, and the burning alcohol gives off a pleasant scent and a deep verdant flame.
While the Feeorin is busy playing Pyrotechnic, both Mandalorians lean out their respective windows and begin dumping blaster bolts at the remaining speeder rider. The turbulent nature of the ride can not be helping Wes's condition much, or his aim, as his spray of blaster bolts are wild and hit just about everything but the security officer. Al'verde doesn't find himself with much better luck, his hold-out blaster merely marring the paint on the security speeder.
The speeder cop returns fire in kind, raining crimson-colored death on the rear of the A-A9c, blasting away its bumper. The hatch to the rear storage bay threatens to fly off, but Oraltor redoubles his concentration, and tightens his grip on the trunk lid, keeping it close. Large droplets of sweat are pouring down the Ithorian's face, and his eyes remain tightly shut. **(A-A9c at 57/80)**
********************************************************************************
The air flowing through the cabin from the open windows causes the little attendant droid to bounce and sway, but Jasper manages to maintain his position through constant corrections with his repulsors.
Rehn punches up a new map overlay detailing the alleys and avenues of the Wheel, and is able to calculate a new route for Nestil. The question is, will the Imperial Knight take a left for the Wheel's more crime-laden districts, or right for where the wealthy, and much more secure, reside?

Nestil makes the turn to head towards the poorer, less well patrolled portion of the station. While at the same time trying to keep the speeder truck steady to allow the Mandalorian to get a better shot at the remaining speeder bike.

As Wes leaned out out the window the truck made contact with the speeder that was alongside them. The resulting collision sent a jarring shock through the truck further jarring Wes who was half out the window. If it hadn't been for the armor he would have been bruised along his side and under his arm from being thrown into the door. **"We're not going to hit anything with you driving like that."** He yelled to the inside of the passenger compartment.
Despite his words the ride didn't smooth out as he tried to line up his shot. Another quick juke from Nestil and his shot went wide leaving a large carbon scoring on a corner of a structure they had just passed.
**"Kark this!"** Wes said out loud. He shifted his aim from the driver to the speeder itself. ***might as well aim for the larger of the two. Besides Al's hold-out is barely touching it.***
Already hanging out the window Wes shifted his arms slightly to bring the speeder into his sights. ***Have to make this one count. Just hold her still Jetii. Hold her still.*** It seemed as if Nestil knew what he wanted or needed as she tried to keep the truck as steady as possible.

Feeling the truck shift and swerve, Kurr admires his handy work for a moment before yelling, "**Fire in th' hole Mates!**" and, laughing like a mad-man, whipping the makeshift explosive out the window and at the farthest biker-cop. Immediately he looks back down at the mini-bar and, puffing on the cigar, thinking, ***May have t' ditch th' Lum after all … damn shame really … 'course, if we actually get outta this mess, may be worth keepin' to celebrate my ship***. He grinned whimsically at the thought of having his own ship ... even if it meant that he'd have to kill a few others to keep it.

Callia makes a low noise in the back of his throat - unbelievably, as the volume increases it becomes apparent that he's growling! His goggles off, his eyes bruised, and his already wild hair thrown into greater than normal disarray by the violent ride, the scientist appears positively frightening in the same way that a Kowakian monkey-lizard is frightening when it's about to pounce at your face and gouge your eyes.
'You,' he snaps at Kurr, pushing the goggles back down over his eyes, 'had better be ready to throw the fridge.'
'Master! Whatever's come over you?' Jasper cries, sounding worried and impressed in equal measure.
'You have the right idea,' Callia comments darkly as he crosses quickly to the fridge and exposes its power supply, 'but rather more explosive power ought to send the right message.'
Using the same tools he repaired Jasper with, the suddenly scary young Fyrthen begins to adjust the power supply, as Jasper looks on over his shoulder. The two converse quickly in low tones, the droid apparently offering advice.

When Nestil turned left, following his plan, Rehn let out a sigh of relief. Finally, someone was listening to him.
He glanced back to where all the others were in the truck, as the kid in the labcoat started messing around with the fridge. And when Rehn saw what he was doing with it, only one thing entered his head. *Frak.* He was going to get them all blown up, if he wasn't careful.
"Be careful! Fridges weren't designed to be used as bombs. You have to make sure that you don't get an overload too fast or we'll all be blown to Bastion and land on the Emperor's throne as a pile of smoking ashes!"

Nestil sends the speeder truck into a looping left turn, the repulsors squealing in protest as they adjust their output to compensate. As she gasses it down the left avenue, those few pedestrians remaining on the street quickly dive out of the way and hide behind whatever obstruction they can find. The Imperial Knight liberally applies the throttle once more, and the repulsor craft zooms off.
Wes braces himself against the frame of the A-A9c as he lines up his shot. His vision falters at the edges, his hibernation sickness warring with the adrenaline coursing through his veins. But Nestil's turn at the last moment threatens to toss the Mandalorian from the truck, and its all that he can do to maintain his perch as his blaster shot goes wide. Al'verde also tries for a precise shot, but hits his helmeted head on the top of the trucks interior, his blaster bolt putting a scorching hole in the cart of a rug vendor, and very nearly the vendor himself.
The Speeder Cop continues his dogged chase, and seeing the direction the A-A9c has turned, he unleashes a torrent of blaster cannon fire in an attempt to finish the would-be comrades before they get too far. Blaster bolts streak past the open windows, some glancing the pillars and one taking off a side-view mirror, but they do no major damage. A high-pitched whine can be heard from the speeder bike as the security officer lets out the throttle, drawing even closer.
********************************************************************************
Kurr pitches his incendiary cocktail in an overhand lob, hoping to catch the speeder cop in the flaming shower, but at the last moment the security officer commits a spiraling barrel-roll away from the make-shift grenade. The bottle of flaming booze shatters once it hits the street, coating it and some of the surrounding area with quickly burning alcohol. The whole scene becomes even more chaotic as people scatter to and fro in an attempt to not be caught in the flames, some soon returning with fire extinguishers to help their fellow innocent bystanders.
********************************************************************************
A low humming begins to permeate the cabin as Callia, Rehn and Jasper go about their work on the refrigerator. The humming grows louder and more ominous, and the fridge begins to vibrate at a level that refrigerators are not suppose to vibrate. Sharper and louder the humming grows, until it starts to become almost painful to the ears, and it is becoming readily obvious that either the refrigerator should soon vacate the repulsor truck, or the group should.
********************************************************************************
As the truck progresses down the lane, the frequency of ritzy day spas and expensive boutiques begins to lessen, to be replaced with shady pawnshops, alcohol stores, and other less reputable sundries. The landscape seems to slowly take on a more sepia-toned shading, but this is likely more to the dingy, timeworn state of the buildings and the poorly maintained lighting than anything else.
The street corners are mostly unlit, and those that have any luminance betray scenes of deathstick deals in the middle of commencement, evening liaisons being negotiated, and the occasional mugging. A quick look back (around the speeder cop that is) is like looking at a pair of *before* and *after* photos, unevenly spliced together. The A-A9c is only a couple blocks into the district, a location Rehn knows is affectionately referred to as "The Warrens", but it only looks like its going to get more depressing further in.

Callia grins enormously, looking every inch the mad-scientist as conducts the increasing whine of the fridge with his screwdriver, humming to himself. He returns to his seat, apparently completely done with the fridge and inexplicably content once more.
Jasper floats over to Al'verde and taps the Mandalorian on the shoulder with one of his cable-like appendages.
'It would probably be a very good idea to get rid of it *right now*,' the little droid advises with more than a trace amount of anxiety, 'as if Master has done his calculations correctly it should have achieved a level of explosive power greater than most models of grenade.'

Wedging himself against the frame Wes used his strength and the bulk of his armor to hold himself into place as he hung out the window. The effort was beginning to tax his body even more than before. What he needed was some sleep not getting tossed around like a Hutt rag doll. From he strain His vision began to gray out. His fatigue from was beginning to win out over the thrall of battle.
He began to aim but Nestil's quick turn almost threw him from the truck. Those inside heard him curse as his armored hand grabbed the window opening has his one handed grip fired the carbine. The shot went way wide and scorched harmlessly somewhere off in the distance behind them.
Wes could still hear the conversation that was going on inside the cabin along with the vibration of the makeshift refrigerator bomb they were rigging. Wes hunkered back down in an attempt to stay inside the vehicle while hanging out the window. He hooked the top of his foot under the seat he was in to brace/balance himself a bit better. **"Vod you better dump that surprise out the door for our friend before it becomes our surprise."** He said to Al as he took another shot at the speeder.
***I'm gong to need a week of rack time after this is over.*** The thought struck him as a bit funny considering he had been sleeping for the last hundred years or so. He silently cursed the old man that did this to him.

"Exploding Refrigerator?" Nestil asks with a tone of disbelief as she listens to whats going on in the back of the Speeder truck. Part of her was wondering where they could abandon the Mad Scientist for they're own safety, but that would have to wait for when they weren't being chased by station security.
She let off the throttle some, letting the other speeder bike catch up with them, before gunning it once more once the explosive was out of the truck.

Rehn slapped the button on the dashboard to open the rear of the truck. There was no way they were going to get that fridge out of a window, even though it meant they had to expose themselves to the speeder. With any luck (*Yeah, right.*) their pursuer would be knocked aside by the bomb before he could get off another shot. "Get it out of here before it blows!" he shouted, the fear of it doing exactly that creeping into the back of his mind.
He turned back around in his seat as he drew his blaster. He fired out the back of the speeder, aiming only to keep the speeder in line so that whoever was going to toss the fridge out would have an easier time getting it to hit the target.

Grumbling a bit to himself, Kurr pushes Callia out of the way with a "**Move aside, ya voorpak!**" and hoists the refridg-a-bomb into his arms, twisting himself in the process to toss it out the rear of the truck. ***Damn shame***, he thinks as he tosses it out the back. ***There was some good Lum in there.***
Bracing himself for a large explosion, he takes a puff from his cigar and says, "**We'd best find someplace t' hole up. There's no way we'll be able t' make it off this hunk o' metal at this rate!**"

The security officer smirks to himself and draws his blaster pistol as the A-A9c slows down. He looks down at the integrated comm system on his speeder, relaying the situation and requesting back up, thinking that he had the band of wayward criminals cornered.
...The look of surprise and pure confusion on his face is forever immortalized as the rear window of the repulsor truck lowers, and a humming, vibrating miniature refrigerator comes flying out to catch him square in the chest. The poor, unfortunate speeder cop has barely enough time to register a "Huh?" before a chime sounds like an oven timer that's reached completion, and the refrigerator explodes in a mushrooming fireball of matte black plastic and bottles of expensive liquor. Glass shatters, tables flip and people scream as the concussive force of the blast also overturns the speeder bike, and buffets those sitting in the A-A9c through the open rear window. **(Al'verde rolls 20, 42 damage)**
Nestil mashes the accelerator again, and the raggedly rugged heavy speeder transport trundles down the avenue, deeper into the poor quarter of the Wheel.
********************************************************************************
It doesn't take a Zeltron to be able to read the hunger in the stares that the A-A9c receives, even in its damaged state. The further into the Warrens the speeder travels, the more its passengers see violence and debauchery being perpetrated in the shadows, and the number of roving gangs increases. The sound of security sirens fades into the distance, and it doesn't appear that the truck is being followed.
After nearly a half hour's worth of traveling, Rehn checks his map and can see that they are half way through the Warren's, and at the end of the decrepit district is a very quick ride to the central weapon's locker and the starport where Kurr has his "new" starship docked. And they've been unmolested so far!
As Nestil pilots the heavy transport through an intersection into a long stretch of road, Wes and Callia spy forms filtering out from under the shadowy eaves of buildings and out of the dark alleys to begin slowly filling the street behind them. About half a kilometer in front of the truck, the Imperial Knight and the Slicer find the same occurrence, although the shadowy figures there are collecting in front of a parked pair of dodgey-looking landspeeders.
Kurr knows a "Toll Booth" when he sees one. Its an age-old tactic handed down from goon, to thug, to miscreant whereby bands of 'highwaymen' blockade travelers and exact a tax. Often times this is just in credits, but there is many a tale of wayward spacers being fleeced of all they owned, including in some instances their freedom or their lives, because the Toll was just too high.
**"Well, well, well, if it isn't Sheffro Gil'usa. Out for a bit of slumming, or did you get homesick, eh? You should know better than to cross my toll booth!"**
The voice is booming, and comes from somewhere in the middle of the various goons standing before the toll booth. A part forms in the middle of the gaggle of thugs, and quickly filters to the front to reveal furry creature standing at a shade under a meter in height. Its long, floppy ears are bound back like a ponytail, and a long fluffy tail trails behind it, except at the tip where it appears all of the fur has been plucked and replaced with barbed spikes.
Its a Kushiban... A Kushiban holding a rather impressive looking heavy blaster rifle, and wearing a bandoleer of power packs and a patch over one eye. Its fur is a furious crimson, like the color of blood, and the whole scene would look rather cute if it weren't for the malicious smirk that marred the Kushiban's snout. It is rather obvious that the Kushiban cannot see over the grill of the truck and into its cabin, and none of the thugs surrounding the diminuitive creature seem inclined to correct it.

*Oh frak.* "Nestil, whatever you do, don't stop. I don't like the look of this at all." Worry and a bit of fear crept into Rehn's voice as he made his suggestion. "I don't care if you have to ram every one of them down, don't stop."
His hand tightened around his blaster, until his knuckles turned pink. He kept it below the dashboard, knowing he might very well have to use it again shortly. His other hand--his cybernetic one--unconsciously pushed his purple hair back away from his eyes in a none-too-subtle display of his nervousness.

"**Ain't like we don't have th' muscle t' help us out, eh? Hell, it'd be better than tryin' t' motor through the gristin' lot o' 'em.**" Kurr smiled as he puffed on the cigar. "**'Sides, ain't like they ain't enterprisin' businessmen like erselves, eh?

His fingers clutched just a little tighter around his blaster as he tried to steady his racing heart. He took a deep breath, then explained again, calmer this time. "J'rill is the frakkin' worst swoop gang leader on the Wheel. If we give him our frakkin' speeder, he'll probably take us with it. I don't wanna try that, thanks."

The improvised bomb worked better than expected as it took out the pursuing speeder. ***Well that's one hump down what could be left?*** Wes sat back looking at the sites. It wasn't much to look at as the area became more run down as they went. Looking at the landscape he talked to himself. **"I see that things have gotten better here in the future."**
Wes laid back against the cushion again and closed his eyes. The efforts of the day were beginning to take a more serious toll on his body. He just wanted some rest and he finally got some. He opened his eyes when he heard the Zeltron whining again. Looking at the chrono on the was displayed in his helmet he saw that thirty minutes had passed. ***Not enough down time.*** He thought.
The others exchanged ideas. as Wes looks out and sees the check point. Kurr had a point. Besides they couldn't fight everyone between where they were and the spaceport. **"Listen, worst swoop gang leader or not, we can't be fighting everyone in this place and we can't afford another running firefight in this thing. If this little runt is no friend of Gil'usa maybe he'll make a deal. If not we can deal with it when it hits the fan.** Wes emphasized the last statement by lifting his carbine. **"Besides I'm just plain tired."** He finished as he leaned back in to the seat.

Callia glances curiously out the window, apparently mildly interested in the gang of thugs now surrounding them.
His protocol droid Jasper, however, whirls on Wes. The little droid's sensors and lights wink on and off furiously.
'If he is no friend of Gil'usa's *he is still no friend of ours, and happens to be the kind of person to extort using a toll booth he has no authority to manage*! That is to say that he is unlikely willing to compromise in any manner that promises our safety. He also will believe we are affiliated with Gil'usa due to our having this truck, no matter what our story. Stopping, if you will forgive my rudeness sir, is a *supremely stupid* idea, worthy only of the most inbred of country Nerfherders! The chances of it working out in our favour are slim bordering on none, whereas we happen to know this vehicle can survive rather more firepower than we are currently being threatened by as evidenced by its performance against those speeders.'

Grinning as Wes finished his statement of tiredness and ignoring Callia entirely, the pirate looked at Rehn and said, "**Look, Pinkie, yer gunna have t' grow a pair at some point, so ya might as well start t'day.

He floats back to Callia's side and begins to berate the young Fyrthen.
'Master, it is unlike you to associate with individuals who fall for such fallacies as allowing purely speculative factors to inform their decisions. Why exactly are we even here?'
Callia doesn't answer for a moment, then his mouth gapes slightly. He raises a hand as though to gesture, probably while speaking, but neither occurs and he lowers the arm again.
'I don't really know. I think they're rescuing us?' He finally manages without even a trace of certainty.

She wasn't really interested in negotiating with the rabble that would have been below her notice in any other situation. But hopefully this short fictional message would be enough to prevent immediate pursuit.

### **Anazider** (2009-07-11 17:03:34)

Nestil applies accelerator to floor, plowing into the makeshift barricade. J'rill's eyes go wide, although whether its from recognition that the speeder trucks driver is not, in fact, Gil'usa or that the multi-ton vessel comes barreling towards him is anyone's guess. The Kushiban manages to dive out of the way, as do several of his more nimble cronies, but a number are either flattened under the A-A9c's powerful repulsors or squished between the truck's nerf-catcher grill and the barricade. **(15 Damage to A-A9c, A-A9c: 42/80 hitpoints)**
The Imperial Knight drops the repulsor craft into low gear as it begins to stall against the impediment, and with one last grunting effort the A-A9c is through, bits of crushed humanoid sliding up over the hood and windshield. Nestil up shifts and guns it, leaving what remains of the toll booth in the dust.
But the swoop gang doesn't remain dazed for long, as several blaster bolts soon harry's the speeder truck's departure. Through the rear window, those in the passenger cabin can see the crimson-furred Kushiban smacking his minions into order, pointing, slapping, and in one instance shooting until they're all scrambling into nearby alleys and garages for their swoops. As the A-A9c crests a rise about thirty meters away from the toll booth, Kurr and Wes see a somewhat sizable mob trailing after them.
********************************************************************************
Through multiple detours, several brushes with death, and Rehn's frantic directions, the A-A9c arrives at the entrance to the Wheel's fourth spire starport. In the center of the large corridor between where the repulsor truck emerges and the blast doors leading into the starport is the weapon's locker where all spacer's check their (most visible) weapons before gaining full access to the Wheel.
**"Welcome to the Wheel! Once you have registered your weapons with us, please enjoy all that our station has to offer. Master Pol Temm bids you welcome, and hopes that your stay will be a pleasurable, and non-violent one!"**
Currently on duty behind the counter are a pair of electrum-plated protocol droids, while a security droid flanks the weapon depot at each of its cardinal facings. There doesn't appear to be any heightened degree of security on this level, but surveillance droids appear to be buzzing about all through the corridor.
Each occupant of the speeder truck that checked in a weapon upon coming to the station has a datacard that can be exchanged for their gear. This excludes Rehn, who by virtue of being a Wheel employee was able to maintain his firearm.

Nestil pilots the speeder truck along the row of docking bays. "So which ship is ours?" She asked the Feorin. Even now she refuses to let herself feel the sadness that would have taken over any other at the thought of leaving her companion behind.

With the swoop gang left behind them Nestil pushed the trucks accelerator to the max in an attempt to put as much distance between them and the mob that is beginning to pursue them. Wes just shook his head as he watched the bloody carnage fade away behind them. **"You better be hoping that this truck is faster than them swoops or we'll have more trouble than you're worth Matilda."** Wes smiled behind his helmet knowing that the name Kurr had given the Force user was one she didn't like.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
They came up on the starport quickly. The A-A9c repulsors whining from the stress they were being out through. In the center of the corridor there looked to be a checkpoint. Nestil asked Kurr which ship was his and where it was berthed. Wes saw a couple of droids that were on duty as they blew by the checkpoint quickly. "Welcome to the Wheel! Once you have registered your weapons with us, please enjoy all that our station has to offer. Master Pol Temm bids you welcome, and hopes that your stay will be a pleasurable, and non-violent one!" Wes looked them over as the Imperial knight pulled up along side the weapons depot.
He waited as those that needed their weapons retrieved what was theirs. Ever watchful he watched all around the truck for any problems that may occur. The gangers were still coming. That he was sure of. The disarray they caused by crashing through their roadblock would only give them a few moments of reprise. Soon they would find them.
He sat back for a minute as he was beginning to sweat. Weather it was just the profound tiredness that was falling over him or the fact that he hadn't showered in a century that ws bringing this on he wasn't sure. So in response to this fact he activated the armor's environmental controls. In seconds cool air was circulating through the armor. The relief was a welcomed, one he relished till the others that needed their weapons climbed back aboard.
Realizing that it may be a few minutes till the get to Kurr's ship Wes looked at the Ithorian. His voice sounded tired as he spoke. **"I have questions for you. More than can be answered in with the time we have here in this truck. One thing bothers me. Why was I placed in the Oubliette? Why not some Jetii from my time. I have no idea on what's going on here. I'm told I'm like her,"**  Wes gestured with his left hand towards Nestil. **"And you, but the question is still there. Why me?"**

Seeing them stop at the lockers, Kurr hopped out of the truck and made a quick dash to retrieve his items from the desk. ***Axe … grenades … Jazmin***, Kurr thought, taking inventory of his weapons and slinging them over his shoulder. Taking a last second to make sure they're secure, he then dashed back to the ship, taking the code cylinder from his pocket.
"**Awright, Sweet Cheeks**," he said, hopping back in the truck. "**Let's get off this spinnin' death trap, eh?**" He waited as they approached the ship and hopped out almost before the truck stopped. Opening the plank, Kurr pulled "Jazmin" [*his sporting rifle*] out, just in case there are any "unexpected" difficulties.

Rehn was relieved when they arrived at the docking area without running into any more difficulty. Once again, he stuffed his computer back into his bag and threw it over his shoulder, as he let out a long, relieved breath.
He looked back as Wes interrogated the Ithorian. He didn't say anything, curious as to what the Ithorian had to say on the matter. Rehn didn't think he was as curious as Wes was on the matter, but he was close. He just didn't like unanswered questions.

'Master, we seem to have reached our destination,' Jasper comments.
'Ahhhhh,' Callia responds, glancing out the window and taking in the sight of the docks, 'a ship?'
'It seems so, Master. And may I just say leaving the Wheel would appear a sound strategy, given what we have just been involved in!'
Surprisingly, Callia nods quite decisively.
'Yes, I was starting to get bored.'
'That's not what Iâ€”oh, never mind Master. Exactly. It wouldn't do for you to be bored. Now, where are the Twins?'

"Oh, er you see... Well, the prophecies only hint at what each sleeper will do, not necessarily why the sleeper was chosen... Truth be told, I expected the likes of Kyle Katarn..."
The Ithorian fidgets under the scrutiny, his shoulders sagging. It is obvious he is incredibly worn from the effort of maintaining his concentration in the Force for so long and harrowing a ride.
"Here you are, and we hope that your stay on the Wheel was an enjoyable one! Please visit us again!"
The receptionist droid's voice is a pleasant monotone as it hands over the last weapon. The security droids stationed around the weapon check-in depot turn to take note of the newly-armed humanoids, and then just as quickly return their attention to their patrols.
"With these prophecies, we never really know what we know until we know it... Ya know?"
Fidgeting, the Jedi historian offers his approximation of a smile and an apologetic shrug to the Mandalorian as the group hustles away from the weapon locker. Oraltor galumphs along at the rear, his eyestalks nearly leaping from his head... face... mouth, as the crashing of metal and duraplast sounds behind him.
"You motherkriffers owe me a new swoop!"
A crimson-furred Kushiban scrabbles out of the wreckage, an unnecessarily large blaster rifle slung over one shoulder, while the remnants of his gang staggers up behind him.
But he is not the only one to have caught up to party, as from opposite ends of the main corridor come the sounds of countless sirens; Wheel security.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"That won't hold for too long."
Al'verde looks over his handy work, his powerhammer slung over a shoulder. After Nestil positioned what remained of the A-9c in front of the entrance to the hangar bay, the Mandalorian made sure the locking mechanism would hold in place, at least for a little while, with several well-placed hammer blows.
After Kurr unlocks patrol craft, Nestil begins herding everyone onboard. Desperation dogging their every step, the new crew of the "No Chance" quickly gets the ship flight ready. As soon as the engines go green, the pirate punches the throttle to full, and the engines thrum to life with a cranky whine.
Kurr begins to deftly maneuver the No Chance out of the hangar bay, a quick flick of blaster fire conveniently making an exit through the locked hangar doors. Anything not strapped down inside of the patrol craft is soon flung about as the Feeorin negotiates the innumerable space lanes surrounding the Wheel, the pirate making for the nearest portion of dead space for a jump to light speed.
But the strife-induced comrades soon find that their escape has just become a little more difficult, as the threat scanner in the cockpit lights up with multiple contacts; four A519 Starfighters, and a fifth unidentified starcraft that is actively jamming the No Chance's transponder identification.

*Jamming us, huh? I don't frakkin' think so.*
Rehn stole the copilot's seat and bent over the console, his pinkish-purple brow furrowing as he worked. He could fix this, he hoped. It was just a matter of bypassing the jamming signal with his own, and that usually only required identifying the frequency of the jammer and modulating his own to one, any one, that could slip right through. His deft fingers moved over the console as he watched for the slightest twitch in frequency that would light up his interface visor and give him the opening he needed.
(Use Computer+17, hopefully it is actually possible to break the transponder jamming. Of course, I don't know what'll happen if he does, but that's all right.)

'Ohhhhh!' Callia exclaims as he and Jasper come aboard with the component parts of his other two droids. After setting his load down at the side of the cargo bay the oblivious scientist turns slowly on the spot, taking in the interior of the *No Chance* as a grin spreads on his pale-skinned face.
'Fun!' he declares, scampering to the nearest access hatch and pulling it up to look beneath it.
'Master!' Jasper declares as the ship begins to move, 'its not safe to stay here.'
'Ahhhhh? If you say so.'
The spherical droid wraps one of its whip-like appendages around its creator's arm and bobs along on its repulsors, tugging Callia from the hangar as loose items begin tumbling.
'I think we'd be of most use in the engine room,' comments the droid.
Callia's face lights up.
'Ooh, *fun*.'

Wes waited at the bottom of the ramp of the *No Chance* providing cover if needed then ran up when the last person started up. At the top in the hallway he stopped. He was tired physically. Not mentally though that wasn't far off considering that he only found out a little bit ago that he awoke about one hundred years in the future.
All he knew from his former life was no longer. The New Republic that he fought for was now gone. Replaced by the Galactic Empire from what he had been told. An empire run by the Sith. The Republic was now a rag-tag fleet like in the days of the Rebellion. And now there was another Empire lead by the "True Emperor. Fel or something. He shook his head. What he really needed was a long nap. No more like a hibernation out of the oubliette.
He remembered the old Jedi and his ramblings before he blacked out and the thoughts of the Jedi historian that was among them now. He was here for a reason. What reason he didn't know. And now they are saying that he has an affinity for the Force like the Jedi. He still didn't quite believe it or quite sure what to believe.
Looking to his right and left he figured out which was to one of the gun wells. Not much for ships weaponry he figured that at lease he could spray blaster bolts all around making it harder for the pursuing craft. ***Who knows Maybe I'll get lucky and hit one.*** He thought.
As quickly as possible he made his way to the gun well and situated himself for a fight.

*Well, so much fer a clean escape*, Kurr thought to himself. *If I make it out o' this alive, you an' me ar' gunna rip th' spacelines apart.*
Looking at the threat scanner, he narrows his one eye and grins a bit, hitting the ship's intercom and saying, "**Awright ya lot! I need th' guns charged an' firing at anyone in our way. Anyone else, find yerself chair an' strap in … it's about t' get bumpy!**"
That said, the pirate guns the engines and prepares for any fancy maneuvering to get out of this mess and into hyperspace.

Just give me a target and it's as good as dead." he sayse running to the gunner seat.

The No Chance rattles and jerks as blaster bolts explode against the shields, showering the viewport with sparks and arcs of red energy. Kurr deftly evades two of the A519s, but working in unison the the pair of fighters forces the pirate to maneuver into the blaster fire of their squad mates, the laser cannon fire adding more scorch markes to the already battle-scarred hull. **(Shields: 20/30, Hitpoints: 137/150)**
Al'verde is the only one to return fire against the incoming barrage, as Wes, still suffering from the lingering symptoms of hibernation sickness, staggers into his gun well amidst all the laser-induced turbulence. But the Mandalorian warrior makes the shot count as the powerful laser cannon recoils and a bolt of pure plasma catches the starfighter dead center in the cockpit, killing the pilot instantly and all but vaporizing the A519. **(Natural 20, 120 damage)**
Rehn's expert hacking skills serve him will as he's able to break through the electromagnetic interference and identify the mystery ship; DLS (the Dark Lord's Ship) Iln'kisaar, roughly translated from Old Sith as the "Relentless Hunter". Information begins to pour in as the Zeltron's fingers fly over his console, revealing that the Iln'kisaar is a heavily modified Gladius-class Light Freighter, although the it doesn't appear in any ship registry the slicer has access to.
But Rehn suddenly finds his attention drawn elsewhere, as a very bright and very red threat indicator begins to blink rapidly just at his eye level, soon accompanied by a loud warning klaxon filling the flight cabin; the Iln'kissar has launched a missile, and it's coming in hot.
It doesn't take Callia's incredible technical talents to come to a quick realization: there's more of the Force than fusion welds holding the No Chance together. It's actually a miracle that the patrol boat is even running right now, and as admirably as it is given the circumstance, leaving the Fyrthen with a great many things to fix.
...And improve.
Oraltor eyes the unstable scientist warily while simultaneously attempting to keep the oubliette steady. He attempts to speak to Callia, to make nervous conversation, but he is constantly interrupted with every shift and bump the No Chance takes in its desperate escape. One particularly jarring maneuver causes the Ithorian to headbutt a nearby bulkhead, sending the poor historian to the deck in a dazed heap.
The Jedi is not dazed for long though, as when his eyestalks finally clear Oraltor quickly jumps to his feet and scrabbles to the nearest intercom, rapidly clicking the frequency to that of the flight cabin.
**"Captain, er… Commander… Sir… We have to go to Solsis VII! I have a friend there that'll hide us, and I left all my notes there! Its a real backwater! I'm uploading the coordinates and the hyperspace trajectory to you now! This is what the Force wills, I know it!"**
Oraltor slides to and fro before he manages to access a console and jack his datapad into an available socket. The hyperspace lane to Solsis is little known and barely traveled, and old spacer reports the trajectory as dangerous and not worth the trip. The perfect sort of place for those attempting to escape the hind end of trouble.
The only trouble is that the initial vector would take the No Chance back towards the Wheel, and into the teeth of the fighter's pursuing them, if only for a few seconds. Kurr knows of a handful of shadowports a quick jump away from current space, one in particular that would take them far away from the space station, and quickly: the Crimson Axe out on Socorro, run by one Rav and his Bloody Bones pirates.

Ignoring the bucking and shaking of the ship, Callia opens up the access hatches in the engine room and looks inside. Expressions of curiosity, interest, disappointment, and wonder variously alter his face, and the young scientist chuckles to himself.
'Look Jasper,' he says, 'map the power routes so we have it on record.'
The floating droid bobs over and joins the young man in the dirty lab coat, rotating so its sensor lights are directly over the exposed circuits.
He is vaguely aware that someone in the vicinity is saying something, but it probably isn't important to him. As for the CLONK of one thing hitting another, it doesn't sound significant at all.
'So twisted,' Callia comments to himself, 'so much to fix.'
He couldn't look happier.
'Speaking of fixing Master,' Jasper speaks up, 'I notice a sudden fluctuation in power levels running to one of the ship's systems. I suspect the system in question has been damaged. Shall I trace the fluctuations to their source?'
'Mhm,' Callia nonchalantly agrees as he reaches up to his goggles and makes sure they are properly adjusted to mechanical diagnostics.

Wes tried to get to the gun well quickly but fatigue was beginning to take its toll on the Mandalorian. Not to mention the two blasts that, being unsecured in the hallway, sent him crashing into the wall both times further hindered his quick response time.
**"Karking hell. I think I was better off on the station."** He said to no one in particular as he half sat half fell into the gunner seat and began to strap in as he flicked the switch to power up the gun. Not much of a ships gunner he was going to make sure to deter them long enough to allow Kurr to make the jump.
Grabbing the controls with both hands he began taking a bead on an incoming fighter. **"Here goes nothing. Lets take 'em Vod."** He says to Al as he depresses the trigger.

Al'verde grinned as he watched the fighter explode before taking aim on the second one.

Besides my skill more than make up for you lack of." he added with a bit of a laugh before licking his lips and taking aim on the fighter. He remembered his days on other ships like this where he was the only thing between the crews death and getting away. Al'verde still didn't like this idea, he always like having control and being the gunner you had very little of that. He made a mental not to try and get his own ship as soon a he could.

Feeling the ship buckle from the blasts, Kurr grimaced as his fingers ran across the controls. "**Gotta find us anuther port an' quick**," he muttered to himself. "**Er else we're gunna end up as space dust.**"
*Never fails*, he thinks, as he yanks the ship into a twist and hopefully out of the sights of the fighters. *Seems every time I need sumthin', it ends up at Rav's feet*. A sneer slipped across his lips as he banked the ship to the left. "**Karkin' hells! Enough o' this fraggin' poodo!**" With that, he quickly set in another port he knew and screamed, "**Get ready fer a close one!**"
Eying the station, he veered the ship towards the direction of The Wheel and hit the throttle, hoping to confuse the pursuers enough before jumping into hyperspace.

Rehn got busy with the computer, reading off data to Kurr as it was important. Though his peripheral vision picked up the ships moving outside the cockpit canopy, he ignored them, focusing his attention on his displays. If he wanted to live--and to collect his reward from the Ithorian--the ship needed to get out of there; to get out of there, Kurr was going to need his help. Well, maybe not, but he wasn't going to trust everything to one Feeorin.

### **Anazider** (2010-01-29 23:21:14)

"This is Wheel Combat Space Patrol alpha, and you are hereby ordered to cut all power to your engines and shields and prepare for boarding actions!"
The stern order is answered by blaster fire from the No Chance, the A519s flight commander watching as one of his wingmen is vaporized by the Mandalorian's initial salvo.
Gunning the throttle to full, the flight leader buzzes the rusty patrol ship, a blue electron storm showering the Chance's shields as the starfighters ion exhaust collides with the plasmodic protection in passing. Suddenly the A519 spins on its axis, and it comes fully about on a chicken run with the Nemesis-class, its twin laser cannons spewing red death.
Bolts of ionized plasma buffet the No Chance, forcing Kurr into a series of desperate maneuvers, but the A519 is relentless. Pulling a hard bank will get the old boat out of direct line of fire, but would expose the Chance broadside, allowing the pursuing fighter to cut it in half. The Feeorin pirate tries desperately to turn the A519 with return fire, but the crafty starfighter pilot jinks, jukes, and jives away while continuing its own assault. The shields take a pounding and a panel near Rehn fizzles and explodes in a shower of sparks as the vessel is wracked with damage, seemingly shaking a part at the welds.
It is in this time that Al'verde gains a moment of clarity. He reaches the storm's eye, the calm at the apex of battle where time slows down and the droning of the warning klaxons fades away. The Mandalorian spins in his gunnery seat, the white-hot cannon trailing tibanna exhaust as it turns to train on the incoming fighter. The powerful beam weapon barely recoils as the warrior fires one blast, then the next, then another, each one striking the A519 as if hurled from the hand of a wrathful god. The first shot sheers the nose off of the fighter, while the second strikes a wing, setting it into a spinning spiral away from the No Chance as the patrol craft goes whizzing by. The third, and final shot strikes what's left of the fighter in the reactor core, causing the remnants of the A519 to flares in a shower of the prettiest blue before disintegrating into vapor. **(2 DPs used by Al'verde)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The remaining two fighters complete their attack runs and then wash out, neither managing to bypass the Chance's military-grade shielding before they retreat to regroup. This leaves the No Chance shuddering, abused, but alive and in just enough shape to attempt a jump to hyperspace.
Kurr, tossing all caution to the wind at a chance for escape, loops the patrol boat back towards the Wheel, taking the engines to maximum output as the rusty old Nemesis finds new life as it quickly catches up to, and outpaces the fleeing A519s. Rehn deftly handles the most precise of thruster calculations as he aides the old pirate in negotiating the veritable melange of freighters, luxury yachts, starfighters, and picket ships clouding the area around the colossal space station. Turbolasers and blaster fire carpet nearly all points in space as the the Wheel's defenses clip friend and innocent bystander alike in pursuit of the daring patrol boat and its desperate crew. So great is the amount of flak that no one onboard the No Chance can distinguish the bump of barely-missed blaster fire from that of a small impact from a missile long forgotten in the haze of battle.
Finally, after a feat of flying the likes of which the Feeorin will likely never accomplish again, the lightspeed indicator in the flight cabin goes green, indicating that the ship is at a vector capable of achieving the right trajectory for their jump to hyperspace. Kurr and Rehn nearly knock-heads as they both scramble to punch the hyperdrive motivator, but punch it they do, and so the No Chance lurches, and sputters to a near dead stop!
...Near dead stop?!?!
**"Ohhhhh… Naughty induction coil, you don't go in there!"**
Callia pulls a long length of cable from within an exposed panel, one amongst many in the battle-tossed engine compartment, and plugs it in to a power socket nearly across the other side of the cramped room. The moment that the leads of the cable contact the port, the scientist is tossed from his feat and into his hovering droid assistant as both go sliding rapidly backwards to land in a heap.
Indeed, everyone is thrown far back in their seats as the hyperdrive kicks in with a powerful, surging roar, hurtling the rickety old bucket into the depths of the unknown regions.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Al'verde slowly sat back in his gunnery seat "Not again. I already lost one team. While this my not be *my* team....I'm not losing another one" he muttered to himself "My skills aren't as sharp as the use to be. I should have never let that fighter get that close." As he slowly climbed down the ladder and made his way to the commons area the smile was no longer there, but again he was thankful that the helmet hide his face. He quietly sat down as thoughts of his old team flashed through his head *I told them I would never leave them behind and I will keep my word. I just have to keep this team alive first.* he though as he slowly let his body relax *and now I have a vod to watch out for as well.*

Despite being strapped into the chair of the turret Wes was still banged around not just from the chair moving from the controls he was manipulating but the ferocious maneuvering that Kurr was doing in an effort to not get them blown out of space. No matter what he did or fired at his shots no matter how close were not close enough.
What really bothered him was the relentlessness of one of the fighters. The pilot seemed to be a cut above the rest as he alone put the pressure on the *No Chance* and those inside of it. Evidence of his skill was the pounding that their ship took and the resulting noise from the hits.
**"I can't hit him. He's just too good. Karking hell I'm not trained for this."** Anger and frustration escapes his lips as his shots go wide from the aggressive fighter pilot. Seconds later as Wes was trying to track the fighter he saw the shots from Al's cannon find their mark. **"Nice shot Vod!"** Wes yells out as the ship explodes into a billion pieces.

Wes unstrapped himself after the ship made the jump to light speed. Climbing down just after Al and followed him to the common area of the freighter. Siting down next to Al he removed his helmet and leaned back into the seat. **"When went dead stop I was worried there for a moment."**
As the others came back into the common area he ask. **"Where are we heading. Is there any place safe in this Galaxy?"** The Mando ask anyone who would answer as they knew this time better than he did.

"**Keep er' in the space lanes Mate, I'm gunna check on the rest …**"
"**Oy! We all still livin'?! Er've we got some dead on board? Sound off, Mates!**"
As he waited to hear the rest of "his crew", he took a peek around to see if there was something that resembled liquor and glasses.
*This ain't gunna be easy*, he thought. *Even if these guys stick around, I'm bettin' that between th' lot o' us, we're all carryin' some massive trunks. At least th' ship's flyin' high an' that gristin' station's behind us.*

'Master! Master! Are you all right? Oh dear...'
Callia opens his eyes and finds that, for once, his vision includes no diagnostic displays. He runs a hand over his face and confirms that his goggles were indeed knocked off during the ship's final lurch.
'You did it Master!' Jasper exclaims, hovering over and attempting to dust down Callia's clothes as the young scientist stands, 'you saved us all!'
'Did I?' Callia answers with vague interest, focusing more on his search for the absent goggles, 'that's nice.'
The spherical droid turns in the air as Callia searches to conceal the fact that the eyewear is held behind it in one of its flexible tendril-limbs.
'Perhaps they slid down the corridor, Master,' Jasper suggests, bobbing along toward the common area and backing up to a wall.
'My master saved the day,' the droid exclaims with evident pride to those present, 'he got the hyperdrive working just in time.'

Once the ship was in the safe blue void of hyperspace, Rehn allowed himself to relax. He was off that Force-forsaken station, finally, after so many endless months. He removed his visor, then rubbed his eyes and he settled back in his seat, propping his feet up on the dashboard.
"Good job, Pinkie, might make a pirate outta ya yet," said Kurr.
Rehn shrugged. "I've been worse."
"Keep er' in the space lanes Mate, I'm gunna check on the rest ..."
Rehn instinctively nodded, though he wasn't paying attention any longer. His mind was elsewhere already, on all the money the Oraltor had promised him, and on the nice, tropical planet he was going to move to with pools of cool, crystal water, tall trees swaying gently in the wind, and women with next to nothing on . . . No sooner had Kurr left the cockpit than Rehn was dozing silently in his seat, dreaming of the paradise that awaited him.

Wes turned his neck to look at the pirate captain. **"Still here and still alive. It would take more than that to kill the lot of us. Especially with two Mando's aboard even when one of them can't shoot a ships gun straight."** He said with a slight chuckle followed up with a smile.
**"At least we're away from there and I can get some rest or medical attention…"** He paused for a moment. **"Or maybe both."**
