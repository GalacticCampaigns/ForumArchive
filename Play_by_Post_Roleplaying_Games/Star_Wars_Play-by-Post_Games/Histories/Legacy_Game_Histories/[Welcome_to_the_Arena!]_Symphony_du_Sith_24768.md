# [Welcome to the Arena!] Symphony du Sith

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-05 23:37:52)

Kel Rowan, Terric Syrioc, and Zun disembark from the Sith shuttle to be greeted by the tearing, gritty winds of Tantooine outside the settlement of Anchorhead. It serves to remind them of the orders their Master gave them as they left Korriban.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Etude sits before his synth-organ, a massive instrument that takes up the majority of the his inner sanctum. He has stripped to the waste, and sweat pours from his wiry shoulders. From the lack of sleep enjoyed by the academy, he has been playing for over sixteen hours and has only stopped at your arrival.
**"Make your way to Sorroco. Find the Imperial Knight Severn. Kill him, and bring his belongings to me. He hides in the Arenas in Killee-Kor. Between the three of you, you should have little trouble with one Imperial Knight. Fail and live, and I'll use what's left of you in my next series of experiments. A ship awaits you,"** he murmurs, having never turned from the instrument. His hands lift to the keyboard, and chilling tones begin to rise from the behemoth of pipes and electronics.

</details>

As the memory fades, the three head for the settlement to find their contact, someone named Sedai...
-----------------------------------------------------
Uyric Rednax finds the sands of Tantooine hot enough to make his armor almost unwearable. Anchorhead's cantina has been his home for weeks now as he looks for work or a way off planet. The cantina smells terribly of the host of species who's sweat has soaked into the poor upholstery over the years. Uyric sits at the bar, sipping what the bartender claims is Corellian Ale but taste nothing like it. Many rumors fly about the Arenas of Killee-Kor and the money to be made there, and an enterprising sort is taking bets in the corner on the outcome of several upcoming fights.
**"Mandalorian eh?"** says the Twi'Lek next to him. **"Looking for work?"**

Terric adjusts his all tempurature cloak to keep some of the oppressive heat off of him as well as to hide his weapons from view. He glances towards Anchorhead in the distance.
**"We should locate this Sedai quickly and get to our task. Master Etude will expect results and I will not be the one to let him down."**
He starts briskly walking through the sand towards the settlement. His mind and body eager for the challenges that lay ahead.

"I could possibly be available for some work. Who do you need killed?"
The Mando looks over the Twi-lek for any sign of weapons or hostile intent. He feels pretty safe but his father didn't raise a fool. He feels confident in his quick draw skills if it came to the that. He places his watered down Correllian swill and grabs his helmet. He didn't really have a choice he was pretty broke and needed to make some credits.

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-12 04:50:07)

The Twi'lek starts back a bit, **"Whoa, hold on there my Mandalorian friend,"** he says, holding both hands out, obviously either having run afoul of Mandalorians before or believing the rumors about what happens to those who do. **"No one needs killing. Not yet anyway. I need a being capable of defending itself to make a delivery. It pays five hundred credits. Interested?"** he asks as he beckons to the bartender, barking at her in fluent Huttese for two glasses of Corellian brandy, from the real bottle, in clean glasses, and to make it snappy.
He places a small pile of credits on the bar, a exorbitant amount for drinks anywhere else, but the going rate for most liquids here. The bartender is a surly older Wookie, who growls menacingly as she places the glasses in front of the two of you. The credits disappear in a flash of fur, and where they laid are four distinct and deep gouges from the Wook's claws. The Twi'lek shudders slightly as the Wookie wanders away.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-12 05:27:06)

"You have my attention. What or who needs delivered?"
He reaches out with his non shooting hand and grabs the glass. He takes a drink and lets the burn trickle down his throat. He exhales quietly through his nose as the liquor hits his stomach. So that's what real liquor tasted like, it had been so long he had almost forgotten.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-12 05:45:36)

The Twi'lek takes his glass and sniffs it, sighing in appreciation of the quality liquor. He sips slowly, and pauses for a moment simply enjoying the drink.
**"It's a ship, plus some small cargo and passengers. Needs to be delivered to Sorroco, to Killee-Kor. Just land using the information I'll provide and walk away. You'll find your payment in a bank account there, which I will provide the password to. Before we go any further, I have to ask: you can fly, can't you? I've never heard of a Mandalorian that couldn't, what with the large weapons that come on most ships and all,"** he says with a wink and grin, leaning forward conspiratorially.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-12 14:45:10)

Pilot job huh. Sure no problem. When do you need it there by?
On the inside Uyric is grinning ear to ear. This couldn't have worked out better if he had planned it. He's getting paid 500 credits to fly to the place he wanted to go to in the first place. He sits back in his chair and takes another drink of the fine liquor. The heat of this place even in the supposedly climate controlled bar was getting to him and he couldn't wait to leave it behind. Tattooine what a poodoo hole. He could hardly believe that the Jedi order had been started by some water jockey from this place. Who the hell would live here cultivating water from atmospheric converters. He slowly raises his right hand from under the table and offers it to the Twi-lek ready to seal the deal.

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-13 04:37:39)

**"As soon as the passengers arrive. Give me your comm code, I'll contact you once they get here,"** his grin grows wider as he shakes your hand. He rises and lifts his glass to you, **"To good business, ah?"** he says as he tosses back the last of his brandy. He slams the glass down on the bar, then with a wave moves to leave.

Kel pulls the hood of his cloak over his head, folding the outer edges of the cape around his body, exposing only his hands and his pike, which is currently doubling as a walking stick. His face resolute, his eyes focused on the task at hand. As he disembarks the shuttle, he feels the pull of destiny, pulling him towards the arena. He checks his gear and accompanies Terric across the open expanse.

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-13 20:51:47)

He props his feet up on the table and motions for a refill as he contemplates his current job. Cargo was probably illegal or stolen, most likely both. That meant someone might be looking for it, hopefully they wouldn't find it while he had it. Then there were the passengers. Probably fellow gladiator hopefuls, there wasn't much else at their destination. While he waits he scans the bar patrons.

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-14 20:45:40)

As the three Sith hopefuls reach the outskirts of the settlement Zun turns to the others, **"Find this 'Sedai' quickly brothers, this is….. beneath us. Contact me when you've found him,"** he murmurs with a slightly curled lip before turning and drawing on the Force to leap to the roof of the closest building. An old Rodian female down the ally sees his display, but goes back to digging through the trash without batting a jaded eye. Around you lies Anchorhead in all its abysmal glory, with the commerce center and spaceport off to the left and residential and warehouse districts to the right. The streets are all but devoid of life in the heat of the afternoon, with most beings having taken refuge indoors.
---------------------------------
The old Wookie female waves her droid partner over, who asks, **"More Corellian brandy sir? One glass coming up. Seventy-five credits, please,"** the droid is an older model protocol unit, with many and varied rust stains across his chassis. Around the bar Uyric sees a motley collection of beings from across the galaxy. One corner of the bar is taken by a group of Gamoreans and Trandoshans, standing around a table where dice rattle and small stones move across an odd playing board. Now and then a squeal of triumph or bellow of defeat can be heard coming from the raucous group. The old Wookie looks at them, shaking her head.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Frost** (2010-08-14 21:25:05)

He watches Zun force leap away and then turns towards his remaining ally. His eyes watch the old Rodian for a moment deciding her fate. He doesn't feel mercy for her only contempt as he decides she isn't worth the effort to eliminate.
"We should start our search in the local drinking establishments, yes? We should find someone who knows this area and turn them to our purpose"
He reaches out with the force searching for high concentrations of life. The odds were high that in a place like this that would be a bar or something similar.
<<UtF +10>>

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-15 03:22:17)

He tosses the droids the credits and walks over to watch the game. He studies the players and their actions. The soldier watches and tries to get a feel for the game as he sips his brandy.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Snowkrash** (2010-08-15 05:30:47)

Kel acknowledges Zun as he bounds off deeper into the settlement. Kel takes notices his surroundings; he become aware that the Imperial Jedi may have spies all throughout this planet.
“**Agreed, we need to either secure transportation there or find someone who knows and make them tell us**.”
Kel’s eyes darken with hate and contempt for the life on this planet. He thinks to himself.
“**Weak must culled be so that the strong survive**.”

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Valheru** (2010-08-15 22:23:50)

The heat is oppressive but Zun doesn't feel it. A mere trickle of the Force is all that is needed to keep his body cool and comfortable. The Sith warrior decides they can track down the contact faster if they split up so he decides to take an unorthodox route.
Zun lands on the roof lightly and surveys the town. The commercial district seems the most likely place to find their contact so that is where he shall go. The Sith is eager to find the Imperial Knight and he's not enjoying this delay. The contact should have been waiting for them, this is just a waste of their time.
Zun picks his way across the roof tops towards the spaceport, using the Force for assistance when necessary. It's not really any faster but he enjoys the exercise. If anyone notices him he merely smiles menacingly at them. Let them envy the power and glory of the Sith.

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-17 15:58:56)

Terric stretches out in the Force, searching for high concentrations of life and finds.... that almost every building around him has high concentrations of life.
He, Kel and Zun all feel the flare shortly there after. Across the courtyard to the left is a Force sensitive, weak, but with some training. From his vantage point on the roof Zun can see the being: a Twi'lek male, dressed in pale robes, exiting the local cantina. As he watches, the man looks up and sees Zun, after which a grin breaks across his face and he begins heading towards the three.
-------------------------------------
Uyric studies the players and their actions, having a great deal of trouble deciphering what rules there may be to this strange game. Speaking neither Trandoshan nor Gamorrean, he can only judge but tone and temper. One Gamorrean moves a stone across the board and then rolls his dice, squealing in triumph. The Trandoshan across from him snarls, slapping the pieces, dice, and board from the table. An argument brews, with members of both species reaching towards weapons that had been forgotten around the game...
((OOC remember to use the dice roller when you make a roll OOC))

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-17 18:59:22)

Sensing that now might be a good time to check on the ship he is supposed to be flying, Uyric heads for the door before the screaming and blaster fire starts. He sees the Twilek looking up towards a building. He moves up behind the twilek but off center to the twileks right. He has his hand resting on his hip near his weapon but not actually on it.
"What are you staring at?"

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Frost** (2010-08-17 21:07:19)

Terric feels the force energy and homes in on it. He feels Zun and Kel react to it as well. He starts moving towards the location moving through the busy Anchorhead streets. He wonders if thier contact is a Sith spy, one of the lucky ones who didn't die in training but didn't have the calling of a true Sith. These being has some minor force abilities and serve the Sith in useful ways, like setting up transports and gathering information. He hopes they can get this done quickly and get to the Arena soon.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Snowkrash** (2010-08-18 13:06:27)

Kel picks up on Terric being aware of something. He lets slip a grin and whispers in a low tone.
“**What is it, brother? Prey or Predator?**”

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Valheru** (2010-08-18 15:02:00)

Zun senses the presence of an unknown Force-sensitive and locks onto the Twi’lek. Thinking he sees the light of recognition in the being’s eyes Zun sends a surge of triumph to his companions. The Sith then leaps from the roof to land in front of the Twi’lek.
**“Sedai, I presume,”** he states more than asks with his typical arrogance.

---

"We are Sith, Brother. Everything is prey to us"
The Nagai works his way through the crowd towards where he feel the presence coming from.

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-18 23:25:36)

The Twi'lek turns to Uyric slightly shocked to find the man there. In response to Uyric's question he says, **"Oh, well I believe I just saw a transport land. And unless I miss my guess, it'll be carrying your passengers."** The Twi'lek's demeanor goes from slightly nervous to borderline hysterical as the bar behind the two of you erupts with sounds of screams and blaster fire.
**"Come come, quickly! Lets go meet them eh?"** he says frantically as he heads across the courtyard away from the bar.
----------------------------------------
Zun sees the Twi'lek and another being, a Mandalorian by the armor, work their way closer through the traffic as the doors of the building they had exited are thrown wide to facilitate a stampede of lifeforms from inside followed by blaster fire. He eyes the ongoing battle long enough to gauge the threat and long enough for the Twi'lek and his companion to reach the building he has perched on.
------------------------------------------
Kel and Terric make their way through the ground traffic consisting of scattered pedestrians and cargo haulers, feeling the Force presence of the Twi'lek. As they round the final barrier Zun lands between them and says, rather nonchalantly considering the blaster fire Kel and Terric can see coming from the bar, **"Sedai, I presume."**
**"Ah yes, masters, yes. Your transport is awaiting you. Landing bay 6, one block over if you turn left here,"** the Twi'lek replies, gesturing off to the left. **"And this fine Mandalorian here is your pilot,"** he continues, motioning towards Uyric. He digs out a data pad and passes it to Uyric. He leans in and places a hand on Uyric's shoulder, whispering, **"The data pad contains instructions, launch codes, your bank account information and the passcode to access the account. Oh, and introduce yourself."**
Turning back to the three Sith hopefuls before him he rambles on, **"I'm sure you masters have pressing matters to attend to, and I must return to my duties. Safe journey, and happy hunting, eh? Ha!"** He finishes with an all too familiar malevolent gleam in his eye and a wink for the hopefuls before turning and fading into the crowd and disappearing from view.

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Valheru** (2010-08-19 00:49:14)

Zun takes the unfolding events completely in stride and nods towards the pilot.
**"Very well. Mandalorians have served the Sith well in the past. Come, let us head for the ship. We have pressing business elsewhere."**
The Sith warrior speaks in a cool, calm voice and gives off the appearance of being completely unconcerned with the growing firefight taking place behind them. In reality his Force senses are trained on the brawl and he is highly alert in case random fire should come their way.
Zun turns his back to the cantina and heads towards the docking bay indicated by Sedai.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-19 02:28:07)

"Sith. Jedi, Mando's always serve who ever pays the most. The color of your lightsaber doesn't matter just the color of your credits."
He takes the data pad and secures it away. His helmet hides his features but anyone sensing him through the force feels that he didn't actually take any offense at the remark.
"I'm Uyric. I'm headed to the Arena to make my fame and fortune, that where your headed?"

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Frost** (2010-08-19 16:03:41)

"Your sense of humor will serve you well. We are heading to the arena as well to make our mark and prove our worth."
Terric eyes the man carefully evaluating his measure and worth. An non Sith ally would be useful in maintaining their cover.
"What have you heard about this place?"
As he speaks the question he turns and starts walking towards the spaceport hoping to walk and talk.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Snowkrash** (2010-08-19 16:57:33)

Kel listens to the conversation with Terric and Uyric. He feels the pull of chaos and death as they walk farther and farther away from the brawl. How he would have enjoyed slaughtering the dregs in that bar, at the same time performing a civil service by cleansing the local gene pool of its filth.
"Soon, very soon…" He thinks to himself.
As the two talk, he keeps an eye out for anyone following them.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-19 22:50:02)

As they move through the crowded streets Uyric ponders the Sith's question. He doesn't know much other than a group of pirates set up some sort of battle arena out in the middle of nowhere.
"What I've heard is mostly just rumor and speculation. The best rumor I think I have heard is that Droid manufacturers send thier battle droid prototypes there for field testing. I'm not sure exactly how it works as far as bets and purses go, but the better you are the farther you will go."
Uyric's hand rests easily on the handle of his pistol as they walk. He notices that people tend to move out of the groups way as if they can sense the danger in thier midst.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-20 00:27:40)

As the four of you reach landing bay 6 you enter to find a ship. It is small, a shuttle, with a tall fin and two wings almost as long as the center fin in an upright position. The shuttle was once white or gray, now it is rusted in places and shows massive amounts of carbon scoring. The paint is mostly gone, with bare, faded metal showing through. Under the cockpit you see and open ramp which leads up into the bulk of the shuttle, ending just behind the cockpit.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Frost** (2010-08-20 01:07:42)

He looks the ship over and shakes his head. They would be lucky if this rust bucket was air tight much less space worthy. Well it was probably a faster death to die in a hyperspace fluke than a slow death at Etude's hand for failing.
"What a hunk of junk!"
He heads up the gangplank and starts looking around the ship for cabins or anything else of interest.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-20 04:21:55)

Could be worse Uyric thinks to himself as he waits for his passengers to board. He does a quick pre-flight safety check and inspection. He double checks all the fuel cells and food supplies, looks over the hyperdrive and sub light engines. He knows not to expect miracles but he will be happy as long as this bucket has a good shot at making there. He takes off and they leave the dust ball behind, He spends a few moments double checking nav data and then engages the hyper drive. The last thing he does his patch his personal com link to the ships computer so if anything happens it can notify him. He then heads to the galley for some grub.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Snowkrash** (2010-08-20 15:40:08)

Kel boards the vessel, dubious about it being referred to as a “shuttle”.
“**No matter, it is a means to an end. As Terric pointed out, help is help, whether it’s a Trandoshan, a Wookie or even a Mandalorian. It's a means to an end**” he thinks to himself.
Kel regards the pilot and his brothers, and dismisses himself to his “quarters”. He focuses his energy and mind inward, feeling his connection to the force. He contemplates how to best to wield its power; he feels the dark emotions consume him. He sets his mind in motion, he must not fail, failure is not an option for the Sith. He feels, he would rather die than fail. He has too much at stake, too much relies on the success of this ordeal. Though he loathes Zun’s strength and skill and he is constantly frustrated with Terric’s cunning, he knows without them, he cannot complete his task. To him, they are just as important as the goal of bringing down this Imperial Knight.
Perhaps, he thinks, that the three could be the heralds of a new Sith order. In his mind, he would prefer to think of them that way. History recalls each Sith Lord has been defeated when confronted as a singular entity. Together though, the power of dark side could be harnessed, could be made strong, stronger than the individual, like strands in a rope. Yes, yes that’s it. This is the riddle he will need to solve to ensure they are successful. A grin spreads across his face; he looks forward to the challenge ahead.

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Valheru** (2010-08-21 18:55:46)

Zun enters the shuttle, sharing his brothers' ill-regard for it. Still as long as it gets them where they want to go he won't complain.
He silently observes their Mandalorian pilot operate the ship. Only after Uyric has engaged the hyperdrive does he speak.
**"How long until we reach Socorro?"**

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-22 12:26:18)

Uyric sits down at one of the small tables in the galley. He offers a cup of caf to anyone who wants one.
"We should be there pretty quickly, I say 36 hours or so. For being a flying bucket of rust, she has it where it counts. The engine and hyperdrive seem well maintained and above average. So what's your plans when we land?"
Uyric starts breaking down his weapon and cleaning it as they talk. He takes his time and does a good job. When that is done he starts going over his armor with the same care and detail.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Frost** (2010-08-24 01:54:46)

Terric accepts the cup and thanks the Mando. He sips it for a few moments quietly.
"I'm not exactly sure what our plans are besides signing up at the Arena and killing what ever stands against us. We don't have a lot of intel on the place, we will have to glean that when we arrive, if we ever do."
He glances at his chrono counting down the hours till blood would be spilling in the arena

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-24 20:03:56)

"Well since none of us really seem to know what to expect maybe we should team up for a while. I hear the crowds are bigger and so are the prizes in team battles. We pool our rescources for a few battles then we can go our seperate way or continue together, What do you say?"
The Mando takes another drink of his caf and then starts working of a frayed strap on his armor.

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-25 02:20:16)

Tenuous alliances made, the trip passes uneventfully. Following the detailed instructions on the datapad proves very easy, and the landing process goes smoothly. After shutting down the ship the uneasy quartet leaves the shuttle, and Uyric locks the ship down. Near the door Terric finds a terminal, where a map of the area is readily available. As the newfound partners leave the landing bay, they find themselves witness to the natives of Killee-Kor, or more specifically, their offspring.
Not four meters from the landing bay a small crowd has gathered. The group seems to be made up of mostly ten to twelve year olds, standing in a circle cheering with a viciousness uncommon to children of that age. As the four watch, a triumphant outcry is heard, and the crowd breaks off in twos and threes laughing and carrying on. Of the lingerers there is a large Gammorean youngster with a badly bruised face and broken arm being helped away by what appears to be his brothers, and a human child, scuffed and bruised, with a large black eye and torn hands, who jeers at the retreating, defeated pig creatures.
**"That's roight, oinkar! Run away! I scope ya again an' I'll bleedin kill ya, ya filthy skag! Nobody takes my Holos, ya hear!"** the fiery young human shouts and screams, clutching to his chest a small stack of black rectangles while scooping up and throwing rocks with the other hand.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Snowkrash** (2010-08-25 11:41:07)

Kel departs the shuttle and takes note of the scuffle outside. The child’s anger and rage are fragrant to him. The smell of blood and pain are like a sweet rare wine. Kel parts the sea of adolescences, and approaches the human child slowly and gives him a reassuring pat on the shoulder. He leans in and quietly speaks to the boy.
“**Your anger and rage are sharper than any weapon in the galaxy and more devastating than any blaster you can imagine. Never forget that boy. Use them! Use them to attain anything you want in this life and let no creature take what is ‘rightfully’ yours.**”
Kel straightens up and nods to the boy. He leaves the boy to his thoughts and rejoins his group.

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Frost** (2010-08-25 14:12:04)

As he watches Kel speaks with the boy, He nods his approval as the man returns. He examines the map as they walk. He points at a spot on the map.
"Here is the spot I believe. Let us make haste."

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Valheru** (2010-08-25 22:36:34)

Zun's eyes snap open as the ship enters Sorocco's atmosphere. He stands up from his meditations and joins the others.
Dry desert air greets them as the air lock cycles open. Zun step outside and takes a deep breath. The Sith exhales slowly while extending out his Force awareness to get a feel for the city. The pain and anger radiating from the children's clash claws seductively at his senses but he ignores it for now. Instead he delves further into his surroundings. There is misery here and hatred. Sometimes red hot, but often just the bitter ashes left behind when the hopes and dreams of desperate beings are crushed. Coming back to the here and now Zun smiles with sinister purpose. The Dark Side is strong in this place. There is no way they could fail.
The satisfaction is replaced by curiosity as he watches Kel approach the young brawler. He is surprised by the words of encouragement but doesn't disagree with the message. Perhaps those words would enable the boy to focus his strength and survive the dangers of Killee-Kor. If not then he was too weak and did not deserve life. Zun shrugs the encounter off as inconsequential. He glances at the map and nods to Terric. The Sith warrior prompts for a quicker pace and heads for the arena.
**"Yes, let's. We have much to do brothers."**

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **DarthTardis** (2010-08-26 01:10:32)

Uyric watches the scuffle with mild interest. The kid was a scrapper and the Mando admired that. Maybe he would consider adopting the kid if he made enough winnings. Tryfia always wanted children and Mando's are not very picky about how they get children either by birth or adoption. It was something to consider but for now he needed to stay focused. He followed the Sith to the arena with out comment.

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-26 02:03:36)

**"Wha?,"** the boy replies to Kel as he finishes. **"Ye', ya're damned rioght its mine! Greedy bugger was trying to make off wit me Severn Tier 2 Holo. Bleedin' skag. Wot are ye lot then, eh? More gladiators?"** the boy asks as he wipes the blood from his hands and sorts through his Holos.
According to the map, the nearest Arena is only four minutes walk.

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Snowkrash** (2010-08-26 16:07:25)

Kel grins when the boy asks about “gladiators”. He regards the boy and nods.
“**Brothers, our time is close at hand. Let us be on our way. Uyric, will you be joining us?**”

---

## Re: Symphony du Sith

### **Frost** (2010-08-26 17:19:00)

Terric rolls his eyes at Kel's remark.
"We have worked out a short term alliance to establish us in the Arena, Yes."
The next four minutes pass in silence as they arrive at the entrance to the arena.
"I believe we are here, Yes"

As the oblivious trio and their new partner approach the hexagonal structure they are greeted by a relic of the Clone Wars: a B2 series SBD, in an amazingly great shape.
**"Greetings, sentients. Participating or spectating?"** the droid's mechanical voice grates out. After being told of your intentions to participate as a group it informs you that group matches are lacking competitors right now, but that they have a variety of Crucible matches available. The SBD pulls up a list of open matches and their purses which scrolls across the display set into the wall.

* Droids 2500
* Womp Rats 2500
* Thieves 2000

**"Which would you like? And here are copies of the regulations,"** the droid groans, handing each of you a datacard.
The ambient light begins to fade at the onset of nightfall, and the crowds entering the arena seem to double, quickly becoming claustrophobic.

Terric takes a copy of the regulations and starts reading it over. While he analyzes the data his hand slides to the hilt of his rapier. He speaks without taking his eyes off the data pad.
"I would prefer to battle something living, yes. Battling machines seems more like training than real combat, everyone knows droids are inferior. Their inability to manipulate the force cements their role as servants of true beings. We choose the thieves at least they are truly sentient"

Droids, Womp rats and Thieves not much for option but the money was good for all of them. If they finished this off quick he would have 500 creds in his hand plus the 500 for delivery. He would send most home but he would keep enough to find an apartment for a while.
"Thieves work for me."
He double checks the charge of his pistol and starts getting mentally prepared for the killing to come.

Kel nods in agreement.
“**Agreed, thieves**.”
The thought of having to battle a mindless creature or a soulless droid does not have the same appeal as a living breathing sentient. ‘**We need tough opponents if we are to be successful in conquering the Imperial Knight**’ he thinks to himself.

### **Valheru** (2010-08-28 16:35:38)

Zun takes the proffered datacard and pockets it, not having any way to read it at the moment. He agrees with his brothers' logic, at least in principle. He has his doubts as to how challenging a group of common miscreants forced to do battle can be to the Sith, but keeps the notion to himself.
Zun nods, **"Then we have consensus. Thieves it is. We are ready to begin, immediately."**

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-29 00:01:02)

The SBD punches several commands into its console then directs the four of you to Pit 4, down the stairs and to the right. Through that door you find a Devaronian male wearing a shirt that denotes him as staff (Non-Combatant in all capital letters), who explains the basics.
**"Okay, go through the door behind me, your in a cage. When the cage opens, the fight starts. If you win the fight, come back here and I'll be waiting with your purse of two thousand credits. Any questions? No? Good. Break a leg!"** he tells you all, not pausing for breath or questions before opening the door behind him. His speech sounds bored and rehearsed, and he seems to not be paying very much attention.
As you pass through the doors you see the bars before you and a long hallway ending in a large chamber. The center of the chamber is strewn with rubble, and you can see large barricades on either side of the rubble and shield emplacements on either side as well. There is no ceiling, and you can all see a healthy sized crowd gathering in the stands above. There is a bark of static as speakers come alive, booming out the announcers voice:
**"COME ONE, COME ALL AND WELCOME TO THE KILLEE-KOR ARENA! FOR YOUR VIEWING PLEASURE TONIGHT WE HAVE A NEW TEAM OF GLADIATORS FACING OFF WITH A BAND OF HARDENED CRIMINALS!THESE SCUM HAVE WON THEIR EXECUTIONS AND HAVE DECIDED TO DELAY THE INEVITABLE BY LASTING AS LONG AS THEY CAN IN THE ARENA!!! LET'S SEE IF THE NEW BLOOD CAN RID US OF THEM! LET THE BATTLE… BEGIN!!!"**
The cage doors open and roughly thirty meters ahead, down another large hallway, a second does the same. You can see five bipeds milling about, one of which rushes forward and levels a blaster pistol and fires, Kel catches the shot in the palm of his hand, causing a startled look in the attacker's eyes...
((OOC
I'll say that you have your weapon of choice out and ready. The rubble in the center is difficult terrain, the barricades provide low cover (if adjacent), and the shields are opaque and provide cover.

*Ssnap-hiss!*
Red light illuminates Zun as his normally dour visage breaks into a chilling smile. This is his first combat outside the Academy and anticipation burns within him. Holding his impatience in with difficulty Zun focuses on his rage. Harnessing it he calls on the Force and wraps it around himself like armor formed from pure force of will.
Thus protected, Zun lets loose his fury in a roar of challenge. He twirls his lightsaber in a flourish and charges forward to meet the enemy.

His mando training kicks in as blaster bolts start to fly. He contemplates charging forward to the protection of a barricade, that's what his father would have done. It is the smart play. If this was anywhere else he would have, but this wasn't the battlefield. This was the Arena and here that would lose you the crowd. He starts walking forward brazenly. He is motioning to the crowd trying to pump up the enthusiasm. At the last minute in a blur of motion he draws his blaster and fires off a shot.

Terric sprints forward with a war cry bellowing from his lips. His legs pumping propelling him forward towards the barricade. At the last minute he slides to a stop and waves his brother's forward with one hand and pointing at the thieves with his sword.
"Victory or Death!"

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-31 05:53:21)

At the shot being simply snatched from the air the crowd becomes quiet. When Zun's lightaber springs to life in his hands the crowd goes berserk with bloodlust. More shots fly across the distance as the criminals see the red blade, their fear directing their blasts. They move forward with trepidation tempered by desperation: what do men condemned to death have to lose?
Terric charges forward, easily outdistancing his larger companion, to be met by a hail of blaster fire, one bolt of which scorches his flesh.
Uyric struts forward trying to pump the crowd, but finds himself mostly ignored until his pistol appears in hand as if by magic, and the criminal who fired the first shot's head becomes a thick red mist. As the body falls to the floor the crowd roars anew, and Uyric finds the enthusiasm he sought.
Kel moves, easily keeping up with Terric, and slows in time to see his ally become wounded by one of the two slower thieves making their way to cover.

Kel knows that the best course of action would be to coordinate his efforts with his brothers and the Mandalorian. Kel makes an eye contact with Uyric.
“**Uyric, taunt them and draw them in, bait them to come to us. We waste our efforts with blaster fire. Show them that their amateur combat skills are no match for a Mandalorian.**”
Kel turns his attention to Terric and Zun.
“**Brothers, do not spoil for a fight on their terms; let them come to us. Uyric will disparage them from using ranged weapons and when they let their guard down to engage us, we will strike.**”
Kel nods to his brothers and flashes an evil grin.

Zun feels the sting of blaster bolts searing into his flesh but his smile never wavers. He knows his ability in the Force has mitigated the damage and Darth Etude taught him to master pain. The Yuuzhan Vong Embrace of Pain is a harsh instrument and his teacher is an expert in its use. So instead of grimacing Zun draws on the agony and uses it to strengthen himself.
Zun hears Kel's words and there is wisdom in them. However he is not content to wait for their prey to come to them.
**"No Kel. These are rabble and I will not cower here and wait for them!"**
The impetuous Sith explodes into motion, drawing on the Force to grant him speed and power.
((Surge: 6 +

***14*** <- [14] 1d20

He charges head long towards the barricade and vaults it with ease. Zun lands in the rubble and continues forward without breaking stride. Once he reaches the other side he leaps over the far barricade just as easily. As he draws closer to the doomed thieves he raises his lightsaber over his head. A wordless warcry springs from his lips. Zun hopes to taste his enemies fear right before his blade tastes their flesh.

### **Magical2099** (2010-09-03 06:30:19)

Zun's impressive display of the power of Force has a great effect on the criminals, as shown by their desperate concentration of fire against him. Zun is upon the closest so quickly the poor being simply squeezes his trigger by reflex, but even this instinctive reaction is good enough to score a burning line across the giant warrior's thigh since he had given up all pretense of defense in his head-long rush. The others back-pedal hurriedly, fear blatantly etched across their faces, and as they do so they line up much better shots. One moves back and to Zun's right, striking the giant tattooed man another glancing blow. Another trips over his own feet backing up, causing his shot to go high, striking Zun's shoulder and neck. The third moves back and to Zun's left, and the Force must favor mad-men and fools, for his shot inflicts a grievous wound on the charging behemoth in spite of his Force protection. With the furious hail of blaster fire against Zun, the crowd begins to rattle the very walls of the pit with their cries.
Uyric moves forward and snaps of a second shot which grazes the closest of the thieves despite the monstrosity of a man blocking his view. The crowd continues to cheer as the Mandalorian draws blood for the second time.
Terric's advance is slowed by the rubble underfoot, and Kel stops and speaks, the crowd unable to hear him and his allies barely so, flashing his evil smile, seeming to the crowd as if he sees no point to rushing forward. The majority of the crowd agrees, believing the unnaturally fast and large Sith and Mandalorian will finish the match long before he can reach them.
As the simple creature tries to move away from the huge Sith Zun lashes out, harnessing his pain and anger, with an upward rising backhanded slash, tearing the thief in half and sending the upper half flying with the violence of the attack. The crowd's volume reaches intolerable levels, but all can see the the stagger in Zun's step...

They liked that did they. Wait till they see this.
Uyric makes a motion with his hand that activates his jetpack. The Mando flies up in a high arc and as he reaches the top of his arc he fires another shot hoping to keep his momentum going. Unfortunately it seems luck is against him this time as his shot goes wide and nails the arena wall. He levels himself out and pours on the fuel.

Zun is momentarily taken aback by the concentrated fury of the fire directed at him. He refuses to cry out though. Pain will not get the better of him. Perhaps these opponents are more capable than he gave them credit for but it is of little consequence. Their fear is palpable and that will be their undoing.
Zun can taste the thieves' sweet terror in the Force and he feeds on it. With this new source of power Zun channels the Force into his body to fortify it against further abuse. Satisfied for now the Sith warrior closes on his nearest opponent. With a grin he whips his lightsaber around in a vicious two-handed slash at the doomed thief.

### **Magical2099** (2010-09-15 04:05:46)

Zun's grin can be seen by the crowd, but the spray of blood as the arm flies off his opponent has more effect on them. The thief yells out in pain, but not even Zun can hear him over the crowd's roaring.
One thief lines up a shot at the Mandalorian that has consistently whittled away at their numbers, and scores a heated line across the warrior's helm. The jarring disorients him slightly, but fades quickly as he fires his jets and lifts off, flying over the barrier and almost halfway across the rubble strewn area. As he reaches the apex of his arc, he snaps off another shot, trying to return the favor to the criminal who shot him, but failing.
The next thief is still more concerned with the huge mad man that is so close, and places another (barely felt) shot into the giant's torso. Terric moves through the rubble carefully, his speed hampered by the loose shoal underneath. Kel hurries around the other side of the barricade, paying much more attention to his safety than the others.
The thief who's missing an arm fires a shot almost on accident, but due to proximity it still strikes Zun, albeit to little effect. With blood pumping from his stump of a limb, the man grimaces, determined to go hard.

The shot sears his armor and causes a dip in his flight. He hits the thruster one more time allowing him to shoot forward. He pulls his legs under him and braces for the landing. He hits the ground running as momentum carries him forward. He slides to a halt. He moves his blaster back and for like he is deciding who to shoot, playing to the crowd. He gives the trigger a quick squeeze at the criminal who shot at him. The bolt connects and the Mando raises his arms to the crowd.

Zun sneers at his opponent and lifts his free hand, clutching at the air itself in front of him. As he does so, the bleeding man before him floats into the air with a bewildered look on his face. With a vicious bark of laughter Zun throws his hand to the right, drawing deeply on the Force, flinging his opponent into another criminal with such force that both thieves' necks snap.
The last thief seems to suffer from tunnel vision, not seeing his brother fly across the pit, as he fires again at Uyric, the blaster bolt catching the armored man square in the chest, scorching the plate. The Mandalorian returns fire with deadly precision as his target crumples from his return fire.
The crowd's volume is thunderous, so much so that the announcer can barely be heard, even through the loudspeakers, **"WE HAVE A VICTORY!!! FORCE USERS NEVER FAIL TO ENTERTAIN DO THEY? LETS FIND OUT WHO OUR WINNERS ARE!!!"**

Terric makes his way out of the rubble and towards the announcer. He basks in the dark side energy radiating from this place and the crowd. It rolled off them like waves on a beach and he enjoyed it to the fullest. He pushes the lunk Zun out of his way as he gets closer to the Devorian. He grabs Zun and Kel's hands and raises them in a victory display. He releases them and makes a motion for the crowd to quiet down.
He calls on the force to amplify his words so every being can hear him.
"We are the Scum-dogs of the Universe! We have come to this place to show these so called warriors what it means to die at our hands! We shall not stop carving a path in blood and bone till we have reached Rav himself. We kill the rest and when it comes to the final battle we will fight each other for the honor of being Rav's Champion. Only then will the truly strong among us will be left standing and the rest will be erased by the winds of failure. I am Terric the voice of the Scum-dogs and master swordsman"
He points at Zun
"This Zun the Mangler, not much for words but he will kill your baby and beat you to death with it."
He holds his hand out towards Kel and Uyric
"Crusher Kel able to obliterate every bone in your body with the power of his mind, blasters have little effect on Crusher as you have seen.

‘What a ham, he is. Good, good, strike fear in their hearts, inspire their obedience!’ He thinks to himself. The mere thought of having their subjugation is almost intoxicating, spurring Kel to battle on.

After some flashy spins of his blaster he holsters it. He chuckles to himself as he listens to the speech. Scum-dogs where did he come up with that? Oh well just roll with it. He plays along and hams it up when Terric describes his training and skill. It was uncanny how accurate his assessment was, he would have to keep an eye on the runt of the litter. Of the three Sith he seemed the least dangerous but looks could be deceiving especially with Sith.

The Devaronian grins after the speech, and comes forward again holding out four cred chips and four devices. After handing out the credits he holds up the device and explains, **"This here is a Gladiator's Badge, it denotes you as a combatant and grants certain protections outside the Arena in the streets. It also allows access to the Arena-Net, where you can find listings of open matches for each Arena on your current tier. The Arena-Net also allows you to track your stats and data. You can access it from any Arena or you can buy a Arena-Pad from the droid outside which has a live and secure connection to the Net. They have clips and adhesive backing. My advice, don't wander the streets at night without it on.

He leads his brothers towards the exit and collects his winning. He watches as the mandolorian buys a pad. He motions that he would like one as well.
**"One for the three of us should do. yes? Uyric we should stick together or at least stay near each other. Come let us find lodgings of our caliber. Yes?"**

“**You’re right. We should find lodging of some sort. Something that says ‘privacy….or death’. Terric, I can see those machinations inside in your mind, spinning and whirring, what are you thinking, brother?**”

He savors the thrill of victory, feeding on the dark side energy surrounding this place. The big man collects his cloak after the match and attaches the arena badge to it before settling it around his shoulders. At the mention of lodging Zun nods.
"Yes we should find a place quickly. I wish to purchase a few things as well."

**"Very well sirs,"** the SBD's deep mechanical voice grinds out as he passes out the two Arena-Pads. **"Five hundred credits. Thank you,"** it finishes as you turn over the credits. The datapad in your hands is a basic datapad with a blue and red paint job (rather cheap too), and as the brothers Sith chatter Uyric watches the overly long boot sequence.
The start-up is relatively quick in and of itself, its the advertisements that take a while. As they begin playing no amount of button pressing or commands stop them, forcing you to watch, and in some cases, listen. They begin with ads for healeries, hospices, hospitals, healers, hedge-witches, and individual doctor's agents, blasting out the reasons their care is better than all their counterparts. Some seem legitimate, some seem downright unsanitary, particularly the one that plugs itself as a one stop healer/flesh/pleasure house. Three are of note: Goodo's Hospital and Supply, Si-La, Mimwen Medicinals.
The second batch in the gamut are weapons and armor dealers, of which there are easily double the amount of healers. Every manner of weapon known to the galaxy is seen in the images that crawl across the screen with some kind of alien life form screaming **"BUY BUY BUY!!!"** in the background. Watching closely, you notice the same image, and sometimes the same alien, in ads for different dealers. Three are of note: Goodo's Arms and Supply, Roar's Big Wookie Weapons, and Mandal Motors.
The third group seems to be hotels and casinos/pleasure houses. The advertisements become more outlandish and incomprehensible here and show more variety. Most tout their security features, some their food, some their staff's capabilities, and others their games of chance and private rooms for viewing matches. Three are of note: Goodo's Hotel, Casino, and Supply, Mozdu's Casino Royal, and the Star Resort and Casino.
The last group of ads seems to be the catch all, with everything from banks, speeders and speeder rentals, ships, droids, to toiletries. Three are of note: Goodo's Miscellany and Supply, Jawa Emporium, and We Can Get That For You!!!.
After the ads finally finish you are given control of the Arena-pad, which includes a detailed map and directory of the city with addresses for every merchant mentioned and then some. By touching your badge to the appropriate slot on the pad the outer ring of Arenas light up yellow and a menu pops up. Navigating through the menu displays a listing of all open matches on Tier Six with times, wagers, opponents, odds, frequencies for remote viewing (with 5% discount since you own an Arena-Pad (TM)).
Accessing this information allows you to see the "Calling all Gladiators" notice over Arena 5 of Tier 6. The notice says to contact that Arena's Admin for more details.

Zun snarls at the device impatiently.

He glances at the map and locks on to the closest lodging marked. Without waiting for the others to reply he turns and heads off.

He watches the commercials with mild interest making notes on weapons and armor shops are as well as the bank. He finally notices that the brothers Grimm have left him behind. With a few hurried steps he catches up to them and falls in step. He knows that the question about sharing a room probably wasn't directed towards him, but doesn't let that stop him.
"I'm not opposed to sharing a room with someone. Would save us some credits. You guys might want to invest in some blasters as well."

**"You know our teacher's fondness for Yuuzhan Vong devices has rubbed off on me. I would like to acquire the necessary supplies to cultivate a Vonduun Crabshell breastplate for myself. I don't suppose any of those shops mentioned illegal biotech in their advertisements did they?"**

Terric finds little data on Tier Six's Arena Five other than the instruction to contact its administrator and its location. The odorous quartet wander through the surrounding blocks, bypassing several of the well lit and inviting hotels and casinos to make their way to the cheaper back-alley shanty Terric had chosen.
The building is of the cheap prefabricated variety often used by the military. The structure is a flat grayish color, and seems to be unleveled, listing slightly farther downward on the left hand side. Above the door where a sign would normally hang is a declaration of 'Under New Management.' Just inside the door and of to the right is a grimy desk and a protocol droid in poor repair. As the four approach the droid perks up, spinning towards you and almost falling in the process.
**"Customers? Customers! Unless you are bill collectors… No! No, we are under new management and not subject to the former owners debtors I tell you!"** the droid rambles in a high pitched voice. Its voice dies off as it turns to look at the wall for a moment, then it turns back to you and jumps as if surprised at your being there, **"Ah! Customers! I think you're customers. Are you customers? Please, please say you're customers, for me?"**

Kel frowns at the fact of sharing a room. He was anticipating the solitude of meditation.
“**If we do not possess the necessary funds for separate rooms, then it is a sacrifice I will endure. Just find us accommodations.**”
Kel shifts attention away from the transactions and focuses more on the people in and around his immediate area. He listens for any peripheral conversations about the arena or anything pertaining to their query.

Terric watches the Droid bumble around.
"Yes we require two room double occupancy for me and my companions here. Do you offer a weekly rate discount?"
Terric wishes it wasn't a droid but a real person behind the counter, one more easily swayed by the force and persuasion. Guess thats why people used droids for this sort of thing though.

He watches the flustered little droid with intrest as Uyric puts his datapad away and fishes out some credits for his part of the rooms. He looks over the three Sith deciding which is the least likely to slit his throat in his sleep. Not being able to come up with a decent answer to that question he randomly chooses Zun.

Zun is not particularly concerned with who his new roommate is, as long as they know better than to disturb him during trance. He offers up his portion of the rent once Terric comes to a final amount with the droid.
**"Very well. I am going to get some rest. Do not disturb me unless it is urgent."**
Once the rooms are purchased Zun enters his and promptly settles into a Force trance.
((Plan is to slowly but surely recover...so Force trance for the next 22 hours. :O Unless I can recover my second wind before I go over half HP, not sure how you want to handle that. i.e. Do once per day things reset exactly 24 hours after use, at a set time like midnight, or after 8 hours of rest (4 if you trance)?))

The droid leads you down the hall past the desk, chattering as you go. As you reach the doors of the rooms it turns towards the group, **"Here are our finest rooms, their price is two hundred credits per night."** As all heads whip towards the droid in shock it stares at the wall, then looks back to you and exclaims, **"Oh my! Customers! My apologies, we have no vacancies right now, save these janitorial closets. You are sure you want them? Very well, fifty credits per night per room for a total of one thou- zzzzzcrrr one hundred credits. Thank you!"** it says as it takes up the 100 credits and leaves the area through the opposite end of the hallway. On opening the doors you find rooms you think are mostly clean, though its obvious this building was once used as jail house or barracks due to the fold out beds mounted one above the other in the walls.

Kel wanders into his shared room with Terric and assumes a lotus position and begins meditating. Terric finds nothing in his search for listening devices, though he does find several of the more common variety of bugs. Zun goes into his room that he will be sharing with Uyric, and while one may expect a Sith trained in self control to assume a seat similar to Kel's, he simply slumps across the top bunk, one long leg hanging off the side reaching almost to the floor. Etude's training regimen forces his students to be adaptable and not require ritual to accomplish their tasks. Zun's obscenely loud snoring during his force trance can be heard in the next room, where Kel opens one eye in disdain towards the wall before returning to his meditating.
Uyric and Terric leave and find themselves back out near the Arena, not far from several eateries and businesses. Uyric finds a financial terminal and quickly secures his piloting payment.

---------------------
Zun's door whispers open, any sound made masked totally by his abominable snoring. He wakes shortly though, as the hum of a vibroblade approaches his throat. It digs into the flesh of his collar bone and hangs, preventing the blade from digging deeper. As his eyes open Zun sees the silhouette of two assailants, one next to his bed.
Kel's door crashes from its hinges as a Gammorean fills the empty frame, drooling and hefting a massive axe. The porcine creature tilts its head back and unleashes a noise similar to the screams of Etude's experiments, **"SQUEEEEEAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLL!"** and if he could speak Gammorean, Kel would know that he is saying *Give me all your credits before I kill you!*

The door explodes inward and the squeal of the Gammorean echoes the room, Kel’s eyes flash open. An evil grin spreads across his face, and soon he is consumed with the power of the dark side as hate and anger well up inside him. He turns to regard the Gammorean.
“**Most unwise, Gammorean. Your death will serve as warning to others. Never underestimate the power of the force. I am insulted they sent you. You have incurred my wrath and for that, you will suffer greatly before your death!**”
Electricity sparks between his fingers and then in a burst of motion, Kel lets loose a steady stream of power from his hands, arcing it into the chest of the Gammorean.

Errands done Terric and Uyric wander down about three blocks to Mimwen Medicinals. On the way there, their stomachs are tortured by the variety of delicious scents coming from the multitude of eateries that spot the streets around the Arena. As Terric reaches out in the Force he feels Force users scattered about the city and easily recognizes Kel and Zun's signatures. The others he feels are all near one Arena or the other throughout the city, and each Arena is a strong source of Dark Side energy. The exact location and distance of each Arena is mapped in his mind, but their power overawes the Force users around them, not masking their presence but making them difficult to pinpoint. There are no obvious threats around the two, although the crowd is comprised mostly of scattered Arena Gladiators and other well armed individuals, none seem to be paying them any more attention than normal.
Inside Mimwen Medicinals an Ithorian in sterile garb approaches and speaks in a fluent, accent-less Basic, **"Welcome to Mimwen Medicinals. Are you in need of healing?"**
------------------------------
Zun's attacker recoils from the roaring black and red mammoth, and his ally steps forward and fires mostly through reflex, scoring a wicked hit... on the wall three feet above Zun.
The Gammorean hears Kel's words and chuckles a piggy chuckle, and as Kel's hands rise to unleash his anger through the Force the massive creature moves with an amazing speed, sending his vibro-axe crashing into the Sith, causing a grievous wound. Kel's response is beyond deadly though, as the room and most of the hotel swiftly fills with the most horrid stench of burnt pork. The flaming porcine brute falls with a crash, and his companion, a Devronian female, turns and beats a hasty retreat, vanishing in the shadows of the decrepit building.

Uyric holds his hand up in response to the question.
"I do, I took a glancing shot off my armor in the Arena today. Burns like a son of Rancor."
He starts stripping off the armor so that the doc can take a look at the blaster burns. He give Terric the watch my back look while his armor is off. It's not like he really trusts the Sith but then again he doesn't trust most beings. At least the Sith has something to gain by keeping him alive.

Kel takes in a deep breath and calls out to Zun.
“ **Zun! Leave one alive. I have need of one of them. Destroy the rest!**”

Zun's blood, what's left of it inside him anyways, boils with rage. How dare these worthless dogs assault him as if he were a common mark! However the knowledge that they had managed to sneak up on him galled even more. He leaps to his feet, surprising nimble for such a large man. Anger radiates from him in waves like the crimson glow of the lightsaber suddenly lit in his hand. Zun is about to tear the room apart in telekinetic fury, consequences be damned, when Kel's shout reaches him. The man's words make sense, even through the haze of blood lust.
Snarling, Zun focuses his anger on the gamorrean instead. He flings out his hand in pantomime of hurling the creature against the far wall...but nothing happens. Zun's vision blacks out for just an instant and spoils his concentration. It would seem the loss of blood has finally taken its toll on the berserker. His eyes widen in shock. Not since the very beginning of his training has he failed to grasp the Force and bend it to his will.
After a moment's hesitation the Sith Warrior grips his lightsaber with both hands and settles into a ready stance. Determination restored, despite the dire circumstances, his eyes narrow to mere slits of yellow. Zun dips his head and blade in the near universal signal for come and get it.

Zun's fury still burns red hot through his veins. There's no way he can resist tearing his assailant apart; not with his blood on the coward's blade. The young Sith knows he should control his anger, rather than let it control him. But it feels so good to give in to the rage, to draw upon its power and let it flood through his entire being. Besides, like Kel said, they only need one...
Strangely the power he relishes so much eludes his grasp. No matter, he can slaughter this pest without it. A feral gleam lights up his eyes. Through clenched teeth he utters, **"Here. Let me make the decision easy for you."**
Zun erupts into action, lunging at his attacker. Unfortunately the dizziness from so much blood loss kicks in at the sudden motion, causing him to misjudge his target's location. The thrust goes wide and Zun growls in frustration.

Zun's fading senses barely register the slash to his arm. He wills himself to keep going, to cleave the man in front of him limb from limb. Unfortunately his body refuses to respond. In a pool of his own blood the big man slumps to his knees. Not only has the Force failed him but now so has his body. Zun sways as he tries one last time to lash out at his assailant and fails. The yorik coral hilt of his lightsaber falls from his hand, blade extinguishing as it hits the floor. Finally his eyes close and he slumps into unconsciousness.

As Zun drops to the ground, a slow, raw anger begins to build in Kel. He watches as the lout collapse like a sack of grain.
“**No one, no one touches him with the intent to kill, except his brothers. That is a right reserved for members of the Sith, you worthless scum. You will regret this ill-advised decision.**”
Kel reaches out with the Force and shatters the mind of the one who cut down Zun.

Terric chuckles at the warriors attempt at intimidation. The key was knowing when Intimidation would work and when it wouldn't. Ithorians being a pacifist people were very hard to coerce with bodily harm. They more often than not would take what ever punishment you dished out and felt sorry for you while they did. Instead you needed a more subtle approach.
He moves himself in between the warrior and the doctor raising his hands in a peaceful gesture.
**"Please fair Doctor forgive my brash friend, yes. He is Mandolorian and they only know the barest of negotiations. I think my friend in his wounded state is highly agitated, yes. He was very dismayed to learn that the price to heal the wounds he gloriously earned in battle are going to cost more than his winnings. I'm sure we can come to some sort of mutual agreement, yes? You wouldn't let someone who came to you seeking aid and let his pain speak with his voice suffer needlessly. yes."**

**"This is an unfortunate side effect of their culture. It makes them great warriors though,"** the Ithorian says with obvious compassion and understanding in his eyes. His words are nothing but respectful as he responds to the silver tongued Sith. **"Our prices are the best in the city, according to our reports. My herd make no profits here, all proceeds going towards treatments for the poor and homeless being preyed upon by its controllers. We help them survive the current regime as best we can by charging those able to pay, but we mitigate this by our low prices.

The Ithorian's reply is cut short by his comlink, which he answers after excusing himself. As he ends the conversation doors behind him and to either side which lead deeper into the clinic open and more Ithorians poor out, pushing medical beds and leaving them in place to return through the doors and reappear with more beds. The Ithorian returns to the two and says, **"It seems we will have no choice but to accept your offer of aid, Mandalorian. A tenement a few blocks over was hit with a high explosive of some kind, probably gang violence again. The ensuing fire has cause hundreds of injuries. The scope of casualties is beyond estimating right now, but we will surely be understaffed. Scrub up and pick a bed, you will find all well stocked. You sir, unless you wish to help I suggest you leave. It will become very crowded shortly."** Offer accepted, the Ithorian suits his own words by drawing a container of condensed appendage sanitizer from his garb and applying it to his hands before offering some to Uyric and scrubbing his own hands vigorously. The outer doors burst open, and dozens of still smoking injured limp, are carried, and dragged in, with many many more visible out in the street. The Herd moves quickly, establishing a triage in the waiting area, and quickly individual patients (the most dead looking first) are taken back on medical beds deeper into the clinic.

Terric listens to the exchange quietly allowing the events to unfold with out interference. He watches as they start making room for the flood of wounded that will no doubt be rolling in like waves on the shore. Moving silently into the crowing crowd and makes his way against the tide of people. His curiosity about this supposed gang violence gets the better of him and decides to go explore and see if he can learn anything useful. His master had always taught him that Knowledge was half the conflict. In his limited experience violence was usually the other half.

Uyric takes the solution from the Ithorain and starts scrubbing up. He holds his arms up as one the nurses puts on his surgical gown and gloves. He spends a few moments reviewing common medical procedures and looking over the equipment to familiarize himself. He notices Terric vanishing into the crowd and shakes his head. Leave it to the Sith to head towards conflict without being paid for it. He presents an interesting dichotomy wearing surgical garb over body armor and a blaster.

Kel takes a moment to assess the situation. He needs Zun to complete the mission; for him to die in this manner would be pointless. He tries to focus on the task at hand. He needs to stabilize him, get him some proper medical treatment.
Kel pulls the medpac off of Zun’s belt. He pries it open and quickly takes stock of the contents. Trying to remember his combat instruction on first aid; despite all his experience, he’s having trouble remembering what implement does what. He does his best to prevent Zun’s death, applying bandages on openly bleeding wounds and he administers a stimulant to ensure Zun doesn’t lose consciousness permanently.

Terric soon finds himself outside the clinic, and one look over the buildings to the east shows him the source of the wounded: a large pillar of smoke winds its way skyward from a few blocks down. As he makes his way their, he is stopped by a man with an impressive swoop wearing a well known emblem on his back, that of the Darkstar Hellions, one of the largest and longest lived swoop gangs in the galaxy. The man gestures further on as Terric watches wounded continue to pour out. He says, **"Wouldn't go in there, were I you. There's Vong in there, and we're giving it a few more for the meat to move out before we go in looking. If you want in on the hunt, piss off, they're ours. If you don't want to get shot in the poor visibility once we go in and kill everything moving, then turn around and go back where you came from, got it?"**
------------------------------------------
Uyric finds his medbed incredibly well stocked and of excellent manufacture in spite of its obvious age and serious wear. He has seen one of this model before, albeit from the other side of the equation, so it takes him little time to familiarize himself with its basic workings. He throws the switch that turns its ready beacon from red to green, and quickly finds it full of writhing Wookie. The Wook is missing a great deal of hair from her left side, and the charred flesh beneath is a gruesome sight. Some bone can be seen through the seeping burns, and from his experience Uyric knows this was a high powered repeating blaster at close range, not fire. As he looks the Wookie female over he realizes its not just his healing he's bargaining for... its the lives of his patients. With a deep breath, he goes to work...

He smiles at the man. He opens his hands in a placating gesture. Terric lets his best weapon loose on the man.

The stimulants kick in and Zun awakens with a start. By reflex his hand darts for the lightsaber normally at his belt. Not finding it kicks his brain into gear and the memories of what happened flood in. With Kel kneeling over him their enemies must be dead so the big man relaxes, at least as much as he ever does. Zun retrieves his fallen lightsaber and stands up, ignoring the protests of his wounded body. He carefully wipes the blood off the yorik coral handle of his weapon before returning it to its place on his belt.
His glaze takes in the state of Kel's victims before finally settling on the man himself. After a moment he speaks.
**"Thank you."**
The words sound as if they taste like acid in his mouth. It's not that he is ungrateful but rather despises needing to be rescued. It feels like weakness and if there is one thing he has been conditioned to hate it's weakness.
**"Perhaps you were right…I should be more careful."**

In truth, I would rather scar myself with a saber than admit that, however it is the truth. I have no experience with mending wounds; this time, you were fortunate, the next time, the force may not be so forgiving.

He attaches the visor to his head and activates the medical senors on the med table. Thinking back to his days in training going over battlefield medicine. His instructor had said the first think you do is look them over for any other wounds besides the obvious ones. Start the breathing, Stop the bleeding, Protect the wound, Treat for shock. His father had repeated and made him repeat it till it was second nature. He presses a few buttons one the bed and watches as the scanner slides across the Wookie's body. Using his hands and the visor he starts a thorough check through the hair searching for any signs of bleeding or other damage. He hears a beep and examines the read out on the display.

Uyric runs his scans and checks the Wookie over with his hands. His hands find little but the visor's x-ray feature allows him to see the internal bleeding and broken bones on the other side of the body, indicating the Wookie was standing when hit with the heavy repeater, and then thrown, possibly down stairs, by the blast. He quickly makes a list of all injuries and applies small stop-gap procedures to keep the being alive while he calls for assistance. The Ithorian who head's the place approaches, **"Good work, we'd have not found the bleeding until later. Orderlies, take her back to the specialists,"** he says and shortly orderlies appear and remove the female and replace her with a Sullustan male. **"Keep it up,"** the Ithorian says as he leaves.
The Sullustan occupying the bed now has a sickly purplish color around his gills, and his massive eyes are lidded, almost closed. Uyric can see no open wounds or even massive bruising...

Zun rests on the edge of the bed for a moment, recovering his strength. He nods at Kel's suggestion.
**"Yes, I would like to speak with Terric on his choice of lodging,"** the Sith warrior growls.
**"But first we should sift through the remains of these thugs. Something might tell us if this was a hit or a simple mugging. At the very least we can sell their weapons for some extra credits. Our funds are not exactly bountiful at the moment."**
Once recovered, at least as much as he can be without medical aid, he stands up, waving off Kel's assistance. Zun never unpacked in the first place so he immediately acts on his suggestion and searches the corpses. He also examines the door to see if it was forced open.

Uyric's hunch proves correct, the Sullustan is suffocating. The source of the blockage is surprising though: through the intense magnification of the visor he can see the gills surface flesh is cauterized. Like the air around the being had increased in temperature so quickly it flash-burned the tender skin inside the gills with out gratuitous harm to the rest of him. Uyric slides his hands into the remote gloves of the medbed, and carefully but quickly uses the bed's built in surgical micro-laser battery to remove the charred flesh. While this creates quite a mess, it also allows the Sullustan to breath and the thousands of tiny cuts will heal in a day or so, easily. Uyric's orderlies lift the small being from the bed and wheel him into the recoup section of the clinic while a third patient is brought to him. This one, a beautiful androgynous Umbaran, is in great danger of losing an arm, as well as going into a violent shock...

**"Hmmm? There 're different kinds o' Vong? Damn. No I have n' idear. Gruk, bring one o' the dead ones in 'ere, now!"** the Trandoshan yells, vibrating the walls of the small room and making a sickly looking Whipid jump nervously. The Whipid quickly leaves, and the gang leader busies himself rolling a cigar in the minute until the Whipid returns. All the while, the Trandoshan eyes Terric, equal amounts of stupidity and animal cunning showing as he lights the cigar. Gruk stumbles back in with a corpse, which it throws on the floor in front of Terric.
**"Jus' had 'a bring tha' one, did ya'?"** the Trandoshan says, glaring at the Whipid and flexing his left claw. **"Tha' there is the biggest we kilt so far. Toughest too. Barv tore my arm off and beat me wit' it, see? Took four of us and some 'nades to bring it down. Think I still got some bits o' shrapnel in my guts, t'be honest,"** the massive lizard says, scratching at his stomach. On closer look now that it has been mentioned, the Trandoshan's left arm is a paler green than the right, and no where near as scarred.
The Vong at Terric's feet is of the warrior caste, larger than the Trandoshan, who easily matches Zun's stature. The warrior is covered in crusted black blood of his own and plenty of other colors, each belonging to a recent enemy. The tattoos on his bald head denote him as belonging to the Domain Yim. Closer inspection of the carcass reveals that he was young and of low rank, and his vonduun crab-shell armor was fairly young as well.
-----------------------------
A quick look to the door shows a poor lock, and while rifling through the pockets of the corpses Zun finds code cylinders loaded with the lock codes for each door in the building, as well as command codes for the malfunctioning droid receptionist. His quick search of the three dead muggers returns a vibro-blade, still stained with his own blood; a vibro-axe, dripping with Kel's blood; a blaster pistol, with half charged power-pack; two code cylinders; one datapad, basic; two utility belts, missing grapples and lines with several extra rations and power-packs; one blast helmet and vest, all but destroyed and coated with fried Gamorrean; and a grand total of four hundred credits.

He leaves for a moment with the code cylinder in hand, and returns with the faulty droid in tow and the credits the group had paid the droid. Kel listens to the 'connecting' tone while Zun instructs the droid to pick up the makeshift pack and carry what was left.

Burns, at least it was something he was familiar with. He enters the species and size of the patient into the med bed and it auto calculates the correct amount of sedative. Once his patient is blissfully unconscious he begins the process of stripping away the destroyed tissue layer by layer. The smell of burnt flesh fills his nostrils and he is a little disturbed as his stomach growls but he puts it out of his mind and continues his slicing. Once he has cleaned off the dead flesh he sanitizes the skin to try and avoid any infections. He wasn't sure exactly how to do a skin graft of a being with scales so once he has finished he put patches of syth-flesh on them to protect the burns.

"**Terric, we need to talk. Zun and I were ambushed by some amateurs looking for credits. Zun is wounded, he'll make it, but he needs time to recover. I am fairing a bit better than he is, needless to say the quarters will need renovating if they are to accommodate any more guests in our rooms. We are on the move, in the event more of them show up.

Good thing about Sluissi, their bodies are made to shed their skin every so often. Uyric makes quick and easy work of the burns, and soon has the Sluissi sleeping comfortably. The orderlies roll the snake being away as a quartet of orderlies approach struggling to support the weight of a Gammorrean. The porcine creature has a gaping wound in his chest caused by a massive piece of shrapnel. A smaller being would have died instantly, Uyric notices as he looks into the wound.

This was the kind of wounds he was used to dealing with. He had seen shrapnel take off peoples limbs, blow their steaming guts out their backs, even seen heads split open like over ripe chokka fruits. He knows the odds of him being able to successfully removing the shrapnel with out the piggy bleeding out are slim. He glances over the monitors seeing if the piece had damaged any major organs beyond repair. If it had there was nothing he could do except stabilize him until a replacement biological or mechanical could be found.

Uyric finds an amazing amount of the shrapnel, removing each piece becomes a grinding tedious affair quickly.

He tosses it to Terric. After catching it, it seems to fit naturally in his hand. It's shape is reminiscent of an ancient slug-thrower design, a flint lock, and is roughly a half meter long, but the similarities end with the shape. Terric quickly realizes this smooth deep purple piece of corral in his hand is a ranged bio-tech weapon. A short inspection shows him the diaphragm that must be stroked to coerce the creature to spit its deadly projectile. Knowing it's makers as he does, Terric can only imagine what kind of projectile it may be.

The orderlies roll the body off the table, and in doing so reveal the cause of death: another piece of shrapnel embedded in the creature's back, penetrating just deep enough to breach the heart from the rear. The Ithorian who accepted Uyric's aid lays a hand on his shoulder, **"Much like battle, not every engagement can be won. We aren't done yet though,"** he says as he walks away. The orderlies come in with another patient, this a scarred Yuzzem, who coughs and growls in its own language. The orderlies obviously can't understand the massive beast, and simply go about their work, which enrages the wounded Yuzzem.

Between the two of them, Uyric and the orderly find thousands of small wounds all across the beast. None life threatening, but the shear amount of them must cause unimaginable pain. Each wound is full of hair and transperisteel, suggesting an explosion while near a window.

A quick survey of the cantina reveals the only merchants there are whores not good enough to work the flesh houses and drug dealers, neither of which are interested in the goods Kel has in hand. The barkeep, fortunately, points out a branch of Goodo's Miscellany and Supply just down the street. **"They'll buy anything down there, even worn out slaves and spare parts, organic or otherwise,"** he says as he gives directions.
Less than two minutes walk brings the brothers to the wide open doors of Goodo's Miscellany and Supply, doors large enough to drive a stacked speeder truck through. At first glance the place is a mad jumble of everything: one table has blasters, another cybernetic limbs, another ship parts, and yet another spot has been roped off to serve as a speeder rental and dealership.
A Twi'lek with a sniveling attitude approaches, reminding Kel and Zun of Terric trying to talk his way out punishment, **"Why, my fine gracious lords! What may I do for you today? Tell me your wishes, and I: Drujo Sans, will make them come to be, and at a reasonable price, yes?"**

This ancient MerSonn model has been carried by three champions, and four separate record holders in the Crucible."** The pistol is indeed a MerSonn, and looks to be barely functional; next to it are dozens of data cards labeled 'records'.

**"Next we have the blade of the Jensaarai warrior known as Nex, who dominated a pirate gang that preyed on travelers coming to watch epic Arena matches. He was brought down in a terrifying space battle that ended with Rav's Mandalorian mercenaries boarding his ship and killing him,"** below his hands lies a plain lightsaber constructed of unknown materials with a price tag of 8000 credits.
**"Next up is Nex's helmet, the only piece of his armor not taken by the Mandalorians in homage of the great warrior.

Kel thinks for a moment and then a smile comes across his face; a smile that is part sinister and part smug.
“**Drujo Sans, fortune is with you today. The items I carry, while seemingly mundane and ordinary have a dark history indeed. Take for example this virbro-blade. This blade belonged to Sar’dikaan W’yse, a bandit from the outer rim. Sar’dikaan, while an expert thug, longed for something that would allow for the expansion of a wanderlust soul. So he took robbing those who fared well in the arena, hoping to take their winnings before they recover. Though he was becoming a truly talented criminal, the company he kept was less than competent. He recently decided to rob a pair of newcomers to the arena without first understanding the nature of his target. You see, Drujo Sans, he attacked a Sith warrior, resting his quarters. While one lone Sith warrior may not be trouble for three well-armed muggers, they underestimated the power of the force. Unfortunately, Sar’dikaan W’yse’s career was abruptly cut short when his associate, a Gammorean who carried this very same vibro-axe, perished will attempting to rob another Sith, in an adjacent room. The battle, Drujo Sans, was spectacular! Something the scribes and holo-records will tell stories about for ages to come. The Gammorean, relying heavily on his strength, and less on his cunning was struck down in a brilliant display of force mastery!**”
Kel’s eyes light up as he begins the ascent to the story’s crescendo, putting down virbo-sword and grabbing the vibro-axe briefly.
“**Unbeknownst to Sar’dikaan, his Gammorean muscle had been reduced to an unrecognizable lump of charred flesh, and the other Sith was making his way to his companion. In the other room, Sar’dikaan, and his other ‘associate’ lay siege to the other ‘hapless’ victim, thinking him to be sleeping after his long battle in the arena. While Sar’dikaan was a clever ambusher, he lacked the necessary skills to successfully engage a Sith warrior in single combat. His surprise attack, while deadly and well executed as it was, sadly was not enough to full incapacitate the Sith warrior he foolishly chose to rob. Their blades clashed, lights and energy filled the room. Parry, thurst, riposte, and counter! A deadly dance indeed, Drujo Sans! Sar’dikaan, gaining the upper hand in the battle, was nigh at delivering the last fatal swing, when the other Sith arrived. Electricity and the power of the Force filled the room with horrible, agonizing death!**”
Kel holds his breath, letting the imagery sink in.
“**I was in an adjacent quarters, peering out my door when I heard the commotion. I saw the Sith warriors leave and when I entered the room…**” Kel shakes head with the intonation of ‘not good’. He continues. “**Sar’dikaan’s neck was broken, twisted; a painful grimace still on his face. His associate, burned beyond all recognition, lay still smoldering in the entry way. I, being the opportunist that I am, I looted the bodies before the Sith could return, and now I bring these items to you, Drujo Sans.**”
Kel sweeps his hand to the bag of gear. Kel takes the bag and carefully lays out each item, in turn, across the transparent counter.
“**These Drujo Sans, are rare finds indeed. This helmet and vest have seen combat against, not just Jedi, but Sith warriors. This data pad, most likely contains their plan to rob these men of their credits. The stories that this equipment tell is interesting, daring and deadly. The items have value, yes; the information and stories they tell is priceless.**”
Kel’s smile wide like he has just found the find of the millennia.
“**Drujo Sans, tell me, what more could you ask for?**”

He scrubs up and disinfects his hands again once he is done cleaning his equipment. He works as the Ithorian speaks in his deep bellow like voice asking him what he had learned. He gave the question due thought before answering.
**"Well Master Mimwen I feel I have learned or relearned several things. Working in a hospital is very akin to the warfare I learned as a Mandolorian. You choose your battles carefully and try and fight only those battles you think you can win. This is much like the triage of patients I observed your capable staff of performing earlier. Once you have chosen your battle or in this case a patient you fight that battle as long and as hard as you can never quitting until the battle is won or lost. Then like Mandolorians you quickly move to the next battle not letting the loss or victory of the previous battle cloud your decisions or make you overconfident. For every patient is it's own battle and must be fought as such."**
He pauses for a moment gathering his thoughts and taking a drink from his canteen when he is done he offers it to Jindo as he continues.
**"You and your staff fought to save the the lives of everyone they could regardless of species, ideology, or morality. It was an honor to work aside such a dedicated staff and I appreciate you allowing me to assist with my meager skills. It takes bravery and dedication to fight for life in a place like this."**
He motions to the world of the arena around them.
**"A place that only offers violence and death while promising riches drawing in the worst of us. You toil away without thought of yourselves trying to save those you can from the folly of their own ignorance and doing it with grace and peace knowing that you cannot change them except by showing an example. I am sure your words of warning would only be returned with laughter or scorn. I apologize for my earlier outburst and beg your forgiveness. If you ever need me in the future please do not hesitate to contact me."**
Not being a man of many words Uyric finds his throat growing dry again. The sheer exhaustion of the last few hours rushes over him like a wave. He feels a little weak in the knees considering his own injuries still needed to be tended.

**"How much support do you have with the rest of the crew? I'm sure with Howl and Roar you should be able to keep any dissension contained and casualties minimized. Yes."**
His mind was racing trying to recall all the things his master had taught him about Vong psychology and how he could use that to his advantage. He had to come up with a way to make it seem like he was responsible for the Yuzzum's rise and the peace with the Vong. Manipulation was as useful a tool as the force and sometimes just as powerful.

**"It continues to amaze me, the mettle of Mandalorians,"** Jindo replies, titling his head back in delight at the young man before him. **"Sit, sit, while I tend your wounds let me tell you a tale of another of your kind. Toda! My kit. Xan, bring this man some food,"** he says he leads Uyric to a bench and waits for him to remove his armor. The two orderlies move quickly, one bringing a cart loaded with medical apparatus and supplies, the other a plate of steaming mushrooms with some kind of noodle. **"Now, go eat yourselves,"** Jindo tells them as he sets to work.
**"Years ago, in the dark lawless space between the Empire and what was the Galactic Alliance, my herd agreed to provide our talents on a world rife with civil war. Being pacifists by nature and religion, the neutral party that contacted us spent a large sum to hire a Mandalorian to act as protector and scout. This Mandalorian was the only one of you I've ever met who didn't wear a jetpack. Instead he wore a medkit as well made as if we had designed it ourselves. He was a quiet man, who taught us much of feeling the ebbs and flows of violence, which allowed us to avoid the worst of it. He was truly a paradox to me: his hand could be as gentle and mine own with the sick, but the same hand was able to break a being's neck while the face of the hand's owner never wavered,"** the Ithorian's voice dies off as he expertly places a piece of synthflesh and seals it, his face on the other hand exhibits great confusion. **"To this day, I do not understand how any being can be concerned with healing and yet kill so easily, with little thought of the life they end. Understanding the will of the Force is not for me, so likely I'll never know. At times I envied him his resolve, and others pitied the dead things in his heart."** Finished with his ministrations, he moves to sit on the bench beside Uyric while his patient finishes his meal.
**"I learned much from that Mandalorian, including that having the strength to look death in the eye will often make death look away,"** he says eying his patient with a grin on one mouth and a wink. **"I also learned that you aren't all simple mercenaries. Roughly three months into our works with what we thought were concentrations of refugees we found evidence that the neutral party who asked our aid and bought the Mandalorian's was selling our services to the rich of the world, bypassing hordes of those in need for those who could pay,"** his voice takes on a tired tone, wearied by the galaxy's baser nature. **"To this day, I do not know if the Mandalorian killed the being who ran the organization in outrage over what he had done, or over his manipulation of my herd and himself. Even after his payment stopped, the Mandalorian stayed until even we had to pull out, another four months. Last year, a Zabrak female claiming to be his daughter was treated here for wounds sustained in the Arena. Upon hearing my name she told me of her father's death on some distant battlefield. She also told me of the Mandalorian tradition of taking a fallen warrior's armor and spreading it amongst his family and brethren. She gave me these,"** he says as he leans forward and rifles through the bottom of the cart, **"and told me he had left them to me, for our time together in that hell. His name was Marev, of clan Besbe. These were his gauntlets. I would like you to have them,"** his voice carries admiration when he says the fallen warrior's name, and hope as he passes the gauntlets to Uyric. The gauntlets are large and armored and turning them over reveals their secrets: the right hand has a MDS-50 Medi-Sensor built into its palm, and the left a Bioscanner. Closer inspection of the controls reveals the base gauntlets themselves are shockboxing gauntlets.

He gives the yuzzum an intense stare as if weighing his soul.

After they have left the shop, Kel comments to Zun.
"**I thought your performance, brother, was under appreciated. Telling him that he loved the story; that would have brought applause from Terric, in terms of overt manipulation. And this, from the warrior who doesn't like to talk. A deceptive one you are, Zun; you had talent all along**." Kel grins broadly, slapping his brother on the shoulder blades, taking care not to open any of Zun's wounds.
"**Come, let us find 'better' accommodations, a drink, a suitable place to lie our heads for the evening. We are both in need of rest and meditation. We have earned it. Hopefully, Terric and Uyric has fared just as well.**"

The gauntlets felt good on his hands. They were almost a perfect fit as he stretch his fingers. He examined them closely noting every groove and nick. He saw a small crack in the knuckle of one and imagined how hard someone got hit making that crack. He noticed a deep groove in the other that had most likely been made blocking a vibro-blade. He activated the shock functions and gave a few shadow punches. The thrum of the electricity hisses as he jabs and swings. He has a boy like grin on his face.

On leaving Drujo Sans to murmur to himself over the best way to display his new acquisitions Kel divides their credits. As he hands Zun his share Zun stops him, saying **"Keep them, and take these. Find us a retreat, a place to plan and meditate on our coming victories."** He then hands Kel another thousand credits. **"Manipulation is what we are all about brother. I simply excel in manipulating other peoples limbs, organs, and fear of mortality through kinetics. As Lord Etude said, 'Each Sith is an artist, and the Galaxy their audience.'"**
Over the next hour or so Kel and Zun find themselves directed to this area's Goodo's Hotel, Casino, and Supply. Life on Korriban left the brothers with little understanding of credits or their use, but their short time in Killee-Kor had already taught them the adage 'You get what you pay for'. Goodo's Hotel, Casino, and Supply is a place of comfort and entertainment run by a Hut, and it shows. The establishment takes up the better part of an entire block, the largest building of which is the hotel proper. Brightly and gaily lit, well dressed beings from around the cosmos populate the block like insects on a corpse. The casino sports heavily armed guards and a great deal of traffic. The hotel is opulent bordering on gaudiness, and negotiations are quick. Shortly, Kel and Zun arrange a suite for the four, with meals for an entire month for five thousand credits. **"We should have no trouble maintaining this, so long as we succeed in the Arena,"** Zun says as they enter the suite: four bedrooms, a central living area, and a refresher. The suite is on one of the middle floors of the hotel, and far from the finest that it offers, but well appointed and is aesthetically pleasing. Soon after acquainting themselves with their new lodgings one of the hotel staff chimes the door, bringing in a rolling table laden with gourmet food and drink. Kel and Zun have had such before, during holidays and celebrations on Korriban, and had had better at Etude's table when they had impressed him during training. While the brothers may not have appreciated the food for its taste they did understand its value, and thus enjoyed it.
After eating his fill Zun retires to the room he had claimed, one of the two close to the entrance. As he sits his comlink chirps for attention. He answers, giving the Mandalorian the location and room number before ending the call and settling into his luxurious bed, slipping quickly into a healing trance accompanied by atrocious snoring, thankfully unheard outside his room.
Before long, Kel hears the door chime again, this time it is his teammate Uyric.
---------------------------------
Zun answers quickly, his bone shaking bass voice sounding flat over the com while he gives Uyric directions and the room number. Within a few minutes Uyric finds himself looking at Goodo's Hotel, Casino, and Supply and noticing the drastic differences between it and the rooms they had before. He finds the way to the room easily once he figures out which building it is in, and walks past many staff who speak pleasantly if spoken to, as if speaking to a fellow employee. Uyric soon realizes the only obvious warriors like him in the hotel are bodyguards of one sort or another. The door to the suite is opened by Kel, and Uyric takes a moment to look over the suite itself and the victual laden table.

**"Eliminating the lizard will be easy enough but how do you propose to meet these Vong? We've hunted them for weeks now, and they're cunning, dangerous prey,"** the Yuzzem replies as they walk. Their pace has taken them a good distance from the gang's stronghold, the alleyways of the demilitarized zone are empty, and fires rage in several buildings.
Terric's eyes range over the scene, and find themselves returning often to an empty window in the building the small group approaches. The window has no covering, and the room behind it is dimly lit by the fading light of the day.
**"I can agree to a great deal,"** the Yuzzem says as Terric again finds himself looking at the empty window, **"but what will they ask for? What does a Vong value?"** he asks. Terric tries to answer but finds himself distracted by the void in the window. **"What does a Vong respect?"** Kozza asks. Terric's mind strains to wrap itself around the paradox of the void in the window, and in trying to put it from his mind so that he may focus on the conversation he succeeds in unraveling it. There is no void in window, save in the Force. As he stretches his senses he feels the void clearly, just as Kozza's massive nostrils flare and his eyes widen in alarm.
Howl, on Terric's left, doesn't howl, he screams. Blood and fur fly from the great Wookie as he stumbles. Roar, on Kozza's right, looses his namesake as he is attacked. Kozza's right arm lashes out before him as a piece of the wall seems to come alive, just as Kozza's claws sink into it like a lightsaber through ferrocrete. It soon becomes clear that the piece of living wall has a humanoid shape, and as the Yuzzem's thumb claw sinks out of sight into it, an unmistakable orb, an eye, falls from the roughly head shaped bit in his grasp. Kozza flexes his massive form, turning to hurl the corpse in his hand over Terric's head and into Howl's attacker, another seemingly fluid piece of another wall.
Through the mist of blood and thunder of his companions war cries, Terric notices the void has left the window, and is moving directly towards him...

Ooglith cloakers! his mind screams as the vacancy in the force leaps at him. He launches himself backwards flipping and turning in the air. He draws his rapier in one hand and the bio-pistol in the other as he lands. These weren't any normal warrior caste, if they had cloaks of Nuun that meant Hunters. If the clan here had access to all them and freshly grown armor and weapons then they definitely had some deep root set in this world. This swoop gang was doomed if they proceeded on this course of violence against them.
He doubted that he could stop the fight now that it had been engaged. The only way to gain a Yuuzhan Vong warrior's respect was in battle. So he let the darkside fill him with all his hate, rage, and fear as he raises the pistol and triggers the membrane. A primal scream of his own tears at his throat.

He finds an empty room and drops his kit. He does a quick search for surveillance devices and then strips off his armor. With care he lays out his weapons and starts breaking them down cleaning them and reassembling them as he was trained to. It has a very ritualistic feel to it, he even has his eyes closed for most of it. Next he cleans and polishes his armor. He works the new gauntlets over a few times cleaning the dirt that had collected in the crevices and joints from lack of use.
With a sigh he secures the door to his room and places the blaster under his pillow. lying down he grabs the data pad for the hotel and starts skimming the menu. He falls asleep still holding the menu showing the choices for nerf steaks. He dreams of her and a smile spreads across his face.

Terric shot flies wide as the window continues to walk towards him, soon becoming the street. He tumbles backwards to find himself next to Howl, who struggles to stand, and behind Kozza, who seems to be hugging the very air to his chest with all his might. The sickening wet snap of bone that follows can be heard even above Roar's cursing and Howl's pain induced babblings. Kozza relaxes his arms as a gray fleshy sac containing a humanoid form appears his arms, totally unaware of the street approaching from his rear...
Roar swings wildly, not connecting with what he can't see, his frustration and pain soon bringing on his Wookie rage, which wafts like thick aromatic smoke through the Force. The Wookie's hands are broken and mangled from repeatedly punching the actual wall, and the madden beast simply continues to swing as red rivers of blood begin to flow from his shaggy pelt...

Terric back pedals further away from the "street" as it moves in on the Yuzzum. Yelling a warning to Kozza he fires the bio-pistol again. He hated blasters of any sort, they were an uncivilized weapon requiring little true skill to use effectively. The Sith was canny enough to realize that it was better to use the pistol than go toe to toe with a cloaked Vong Hunter. Reaching out with the force he scanned the area searching for more voids trying to locate the missing Vong warrior. Terric was sure there was another one around here somewhere and he wasn't going to let himself be surprised twice in the same fight.

Terric's second shot finds purchase despite his target's wavering form, and is followed by a bolt from Howl's bowcaster, sending the Vong to the ground in a writhing heap as the cloaker twitches in pain and it's wearer suffers its death throes.
Kozza doesn't flinch as the projectiles flash past his head, trusting his henchman and newfound advisor. Instead, he calmly watches the pattern of wounds grow on Roar's pelt, then a massive clawed hand reaches out in a shoving motion, throwing a patch of air into the wall with enough force to dent the crude metal structure. The patch of air slides to the ground and still looks like air for a moment before it becomes a grayish film over the body of a Vong warrior. Roar turns and almost lashes out at his savior before wilting visibly, blood loss and his rage taking their toll. Howl rushes over quickly, pulling out several medpacs as he moves, and begins working on his brother-in-arms. After a stimulant and some morphine Roar turns and begins reciprocating the field aid.
Kozza crouches, taking a handful of the cloaker and pulling, shredding the flimsy creature and revealing the Vong beneath. **"You will make a fine lunch. Live meat is always best for restoring moral in wounded troops,"** he says as he takes firm hold of the Vong, completely immobilizing it, looking to his companions and waiting for them to finish their duties.

Terric puts the weapon away and moves a little closer to the vong with a curious look on his face. He studies his scars and markings for a moment then speaks
**"He might be more use to us alive rather than as some sort of foul tasting snack. It would show the Vong that you really do want end this conflict."**
or he thinks to himself
*"They will see it as a sign of weakness and kill us all."*
Terric then moves to examine the dead warriors seeing if either of the Ooglith maskers is salvageable or any other items of interest.

Judging by the scarification on the live Vong he is similar to the Trandoshan showed Terric. Young and strong, but not as large as the first. This one also doesn't bear the markings of a Hunter.
**"Stranger,"** Kozza says, looking at Terric at eye level from his knees, **"the lack of information is starting to grate on my nerves,"** the growl in his voice is obvious, as is the pain on the Vong's face as Kozza applies brute strength in twisting its head this way and that, claw tips puncturing flesh.
**"These Vong are cunning and deadly. How do you know what you know? How do you propose to meet them? They show no inclination to speak, even under duress,"** he says, casually breaking the Vong's arm with one hand. The Vong doesn't cry out, and Kozza, Roar and Howl seem unsurprised by its lack of response. **"As I said before, I can agree to a great deal, but what do they want? What does a Vong value? What do you respect?"** the last bit directed at the Vong face in his hand, whose eyes bulge due to the angle Kozza is forcing his head into. Should the Yuzzem pull a little harder, or sneeze for that matter, the Vong's spine will break.
Only one of the cloakers is still whole and unpunctured. Two of the others could possibly be saved, but not without immediate attention. Each Vong has two razor bugs and two thud bugs, and Terric finds two amphistaffs and four short swords whose serrated edges are teeth that ooze a viscous liquid.

Terric doesn't shift his eyes from Kozza and no fear reaches his face.
**"I know what I know from the twin benefits of knowledge and experience.Yes? I have studied up on the Yuuzshan Vong and I have dealt with a clan of them before. Yuuzhan Vong culture is centered on sacrifice and their gods, although warriors in particular are centered on the philosophy of pain. They tend to glorify pain, not as a motive for action but rather as a state of living."**
He assumes a standing position with his hands clasped behind his back as if he was a teacher in a class room as he continues
**"According to their religion, life was suffering, and death was the ultimate release from that suffering. Thus, the Yuuzhan Vong are resigned, and go willingly to their deaths. So your torture of him just re-enforces his religious theories. Plus I'm sure the pain of a broken arm is nothing compared to an hour or two in the Embrace. Yes?"**

**"Agreed,"** tears itself from the Vong's throat, barely understandable through his accent. Kozza loosens his hold but stays where he is, forcing the Vong to crawl with one arm out from under his bulk, further humiliating the young warrior.
**"Hurry, weakling, I long to break your pathetic hairless body,"** Kozza growls as the Vong struggles to stand. Roar and Howl both watch him closely as he leaves, eventually entering the building whose window first drew Terric's attention.
**"Well, we wait then. How does a frail hairless creature like yourself survive learning first hand of the Vong, stranger?"** Kozza says as his intelligent eyes bore into Terric.

**"I am known as Terric."**
Terric squats down beside the body of the dead vong. He strokes the place at the back of the head and the masker opens just enough for him to slide his fingers in. Pain stings his fingers as the cilia inside bore into his pores. He ignores it as he starts peeling it back carefully revealing the Vong warriors scarred body. He points the scarring out to Kozza.
**"These scars are mostly self inflicted Yes. They do this to prove their dedication and their strength to the gods."**
He continues work as Kozza asks his question. The Sith smiles slightly as he answers
**"Well my large new friend there are more kinds of strengths than the physical kind. Intellect and personality can sometimes be stronger than the mightiest muscles. I think they refer to it as brains over brawn Yes. When you match the two together the combination is very powerful."**
He continues peeling back the masker till he has removed it completely. He carefully folds it up and sets it aside with the amphistaves and armor.
**"So how do you want to deal with our reptile problem?"**

**"The lizard will not be a problem…"** Kozza growls and then proceeds to explain the many humiliating ways he would like to kill the Trandoshan. This lasts the better portion of four hours, and as the sun begins to set the Yuzzem's nostrils flare and he says, **"They come."**
From the encroaching darkness strides three shadows, which reveal themselves to be Vong warriors in the fading light. **"You wish to speak? Follow,"** the largest says before turning heading back they way he came. The three Vong stay in front, showing no nervousness at giving the small group their backs. Terric becomes disoriented quickly due to their twisting winding path. Before long, Terric and the swoop gangers find themselves climbing down through a building's cellar and moving through a blow-out basement wall and into an ancient sewer system. The only light are Vong bio lamps, scattered in large intervals.
At the end of their journey they enter another basement to find a crude throne room/garden, with dozens of Vong eying the group balefully. The throne, made of old crates stacked together, is occupied by a striking Vong female, easily 1.9 meters tall and waspishly thin, the scaring on her delicate face is gruesome, but not so much as her seemingly living hair. Massive tendrils writhe about her shoulders as she looks on Terric. Her voice is surprisingly high pitched and seems to sigh, and she asks, **"You wish to… speak? With the head… Shaper? of Yim? Why?"** Her Basic is enunciated strangely, as if she knows the language but rarely has opportunity to practice it.

He gestures towards the swoop gang members
**"have asked me to come speak to you on their behalf. They have informed me that you have taken several hostages and they would like me to negotiate their release."**
Terric keeps his face as calm and still as a placid pool. He tries to give off an aura of confidence.
**"From what I have been told, your clan and theirs are involved in a territory dispute. Yes? Do you have any real desire to see an end to this conflict or does battling these infidels bring you pleasure? I do not ask this question to be disrespectful Mistress Shaper only to learn.

The female stands and steps down from her throne, her painfully thin waist making her hips seem full and well rounded despite their small size. Her gait is rolling as she steps towards Terric and Kozza. **Your fluency in my language will make the negotiations go quickly, but"** she responds in flawless Vongese before shifting back to broken Basic, **"I? Must practice… yours? If my domain is… to thrive?"** she steps around Kozza as if thinking of buying him, one thin hand on her hip and her shoulders back, making her small breasts seem large on her tiny frame. **"My domain had no… quarrel? With these, *Nom'o,* these… enemies? My warriors… enjoyed? Their sport… briefly? But I cannot… allow? This to continue. I seek to… protect? And… hide? My domain from yours. This is… difficult?

Kozza had been eying the woman the entire time, his nervousness obvious through the Force but not showing in his face, save momentarily bared fangs while she was behind him. **"Because we were paid to,"** is Kozza's short reply. She continues to stare before turning her burning gaze on Terric and snapping **"Explain,"** in her own language to him.

**"Ahh yes. These warriors are serving another in exchange for compensation. As I'm sure you are aware not all cultures in our galaxy place the same…emphasis on combat and honor that the Yuuzhan Vong do. Yes. Some of these weakling make deals with other to fight on their behalf. Their leader, a foolish reptilian, made this decision with out any sort of understanding of the Yuuzhan Vong's ferocity and dedication."**
He motions toward Kozza.
**"The mighty Kozza has decided a change in leadership is needed. He will remove the reptilian's authority and replace it with his own. He is unable to do this how ever while defending himself and his tribe from the justifiable retaliation from your forces. He will agree to end these hostilities and bother you no more if you are willing to release the hostages and can agree on mutual boundaries. This is most agreeable Yes? If you will pardon me I will inform Kozza of what I have told you and make sure I have covered all he wishes of me."**
He turns to Kozza and quietly explains what he has said to the Shaper. In a hushed voice he asks Kozza.
**"Is there anything else you would like me to bring up as part of this negotiation? Anything you desire besides an end to the fighting, release of the hostages, and a mutual agreement on borders?"**

As Terric explains the concept of paying for services Howl begins to mewl and grunt softly into Kozza's ear. As Terric tells Kozza of his negotiations Kozza's eyes have a hard look to them, **"Fine, fine. The hostages are what matters. The lizard is getting ready to move. The camp is buzzing."**
The Vong Matriarch's head cocks to the side quizzically, **"Compensation?"** and she turns, walking slowly, deep in thought. She rounds again, facing the two and speaks in her broken Basic, **"I will release my… hostages? If you hunt for me. I will… paid? you. I need hunters who can walk… free? in this… city? Prove your… words? Take lead of your domain and I will release hostages."**
Kozza's chest swells and he bristles, **"Are they unharmed? How can we trust your word?"**

Uyric finds no listening devices in his room and after a power nap wakes to find food. Zun is up already, having finished a meditation and is already looking much healthier.

**OOC**: Zun has been meditating/resting. That battle took a lot of him. After the four hours of rest, he will start mental exercises, keeping his skills sharp and honed. Exercises like levitating his lightsaber across the room, then levitating his lightsaber and another small object in the room. Going over the mental conditioning in his head, keeping his thoughts focused, and using a single thought as a focal point for his emotions. After about the 6th hour (4 hours of rest, 2 hours of practice) he will come out and get something to eat.

Kel remains in his room for nearly six hours; after which time, he emerges and orders a modest plate of food and after a time of quiet consumption, he regards Zun for short while with that unnerving stare and then speaks.

**"There might be a benefit for accepting their offer Kozza. While they have a very unique view of the galaxy the Vong are very honorable and are known to keep their word even when it puts them at a disadvantage. I remember a story from the the last war where a Vong force drastically outnumbered the defenders of a planet. The Jedi in charge challenged the leader to single combat and won. The Vong could have overwhelmed the planet easily but their honor forbade it and they with drew. If the Shaper says it will be so then it will be. I would imagine it being similar to a Wookie life debt in sincerity."**

"**Uyric, you will take Zun and I to where you last saw Terric. He has been gone too long.

"*Terric, we will be there within 15 minutes, you will have to make do until then. It's Zun, he's just consumed an entire bantha. We will need time to get there*."

Zun stands and leisurely refills his plate with one hand while gesturing with his other, his yorick coral lightsaber floating to his grasp. He clips the blade to his belt and throws his cloak about his shoulders then reclaims his plate as they leave the room.
Within minutes the trio claims a courtesy speeder from the hotel and are off, Uyric at the controls and Kel beside him, Zun dwarfing the back seat, eating noisily. Half way there a bellow of pain is heard from several stories below near street level. Looking back the two in the front seat see a contented looking Zun with no plate to be seen.
The trip itself takes less than five minutes by speeder, and Uyric soon sets down in an alleyway. Before them is a rubble strewn warzone, and a lone Terric atop a pile of crumbled building. Night has fallen, and this section of the city lacks power from the earlier fires and bombings.
Howl and Roar enter two buildings on opposite sides of the street, and soon signal that they are in position. Kozza himself stands close by to finalize details on Terric's as yet unknown plan. He casts a glance at the three approaching gladiators and turns to Terric, his breath rank and fangs showing, **"This is your army? This is your Rancor?!"** he snarls, slightly incredulous and wondering as to the sanity of the being he has decided to trust.
As the two groups close, Kozza and Zun take a moment to attempt to stare each other down. Kozza, ignorant of Zun's background, offers blatant challenge to the physically weaker being. Zun, well aware of his own capabilities, stands his ground and returns the stare, not full of defiance but full of certainty. Kozza gives a short barking laugh of approval at Zun's moxie, and then ignores the much smaller being.
***"A new pet, brother?"*** Zun asks in Sith, his voice dripping with disdain.
**"What is your plan?"** Kozza growls.

He could sense Kozza's fear and his uncertainty.Terric levels his gaze on the over puffed Yuzzem. He is beginning to get annoyed by its over reliance on size and strength. It's self importance at being a wanna be swoop gang leader was quickly grating on Terric's last nerve. His voice takes on a tone of quiet menace. The anger radiates from in almost palpable waves.
**"My plan is simple. Yes. You need something that will cause the gang to pause long enough for you to issue your challenge for leadership. I have brought the very beings that cause world's to tremble and Jedi to cower. I'm sure that a swoop gang will offer little resistance against our might. Once you have made good on your boasts and defeated the Trandosian the gang will be yours to command and the Vong will release their hostages and provide you an opportunity for power and profit. I have made this happen for you using my brain and my words."**

Uyric wasn't sure exactly what was going on. He had a pretty good idea. Quickly he decides to just roll with it and see what happened. There would be time for catch up after the battle he could sense like an on coming storm. Judging from where the Wookies had set up it was looking like an ambush of some sort. He watched the little show down between Zun and Kozza with an amused air. His Mandolorian helmet prevented them from seeing the sneer on his face but they could see it in his body language if they knew what to look for.
The little Sith was gearing up for some sort of demonstration of power. Uyric takes a position near Terric in case this display backfired and the fuzzies got angry. The one thing he could offer was the normal fear most rational beings had for Mandolorians. He scans the area quickly looking for anything that might be useful in a hasty ambush scenario, weakened structures that could be brought down on unsuspecting swoopers or places wire could be strung across probable areas of travel.

Kel regards Terric for a moment, trying to understand what exactly he has become entangled in, what deal he must have struck and for what purpose. Kel dismisses the thought, as *'It's Terric*' and nothing more. Kel then looks at the Yuzzem who is having a contest of wills with Zun. The Yuzzem's disbelief at their abilities agitates Kel; he looks up and the Yuzzem, stares for a long moment and then looks to where the swoop gang is.
"**Count yourself fortunate, Yuzzem. For few will see the display of power you will witness here today. Most who see it, are not fortunate enough to live to tell tales of their encounters**" Kel says, with his back to the Yuzzem, turning his attention to the speeders.

The rumble of several dozen swoops soon fills the alleyway, and their running lights can be seen coming in through the natural choke point of buildings. Uyric's practiced eye spots useful structural weaknesses, and he whispers in the ears of Zun and Kel.
Zun steps left and ignites his saber, slashing at a billboard's base. He reaches up and guides it through the Force to land before the approaching swoops.
Kel steps right, and as the billboard crashes down he reaches out with both hands, clutching at the air, and yanks them back towards his chest. The weakened building at the end of the alleyway collapses, with the largest mass of debris landing in the alley behind the approaching swoops.
Uyric steps towards Zun so that he is in plain sight next to Terric, a smug, relaxed confidence in his stance, as befits a single Mandalorian facing suicidal odds for any other being.
Kozza, eyes bulging at the feats accomplished, steps towards Kel, his massive bulk on Terric's left. As the swoops slow and the gang members look around terrified his gaze finds Terric's, and Terric can see the knowledge in Kozza's eyes. The knowledge that he had bargained with the Devil himself, and was now indebted to him.
Terric stands atop the ruin, looking down on his masterpiece of manipulation, remembering Master Etude's words to him, **"What good is power if not controlled? Thankfully, beings with power are much easier to control than power itself."**
The Trandoshan comes forward, easing his swoop through the crowd, **"What's this partna'? Where's the Vong we need ta kill? You ain't aiming ta double-cross me are ya?"**
To which Kozza answers: **"I'm taking my new ally shopping. He's in the mood for new boots."** Kozza begins to bound down the small hill of rubble.
The Trandoshan posture speaks of rage at the clichéd joke, and he raises his carbine, raining blaster fire towards Kozza, screaming, **"Fine! Bring it fur-ball! I'd rather be dead than work with Si-"** his words are cut short as Kozza leaps and lands on the swoop, his weight shorting out the repulsors and slamming the bike to the ground.
One gang member moves as if to intercede, a Barabel, who swiftly dies from several expert shots from Roar and Howl.
The Trandoshan's death is intentionally slow and violent as Kozza tears one of its legs off and bludgeons it repeatedly. Eight long minutes later, he lifts the mangled stump high and roars, his voice filling the alleyway. He begins eating what's left of the stump, bone and all. Zun, Terric and Kel are reminded of the Massassi dominance fights they saw on Korriban. Uyric is reminded of the one and only time he ran out of ammunition, and was forced to pistol-whip a Weequay to death. Kozza turns and climbs back to Terric.
**"My thanks. In gratitude, I will supply you with deterrents and a mode of transport throughout the city. I-"** he is cut off by the air melting in the building with Roar as several Vong step forward, along with the Shaper Yim. Zun's eyes widen at the appearance, unsettled for the first time since arriving on planet. He was often forced to train against Etude's Vong on Korriban.
**"Im…pressive? This result… pleases me?"** she says in her broken Basic before turning and calling out in Vongese **"Release the fertilizer!"**
From the midst of the wavering air a motley crew of beings emerges mostly unharmed, one a Yuzzem female slightly larger than Kozza.

He maintained his aura of menace while being stoically silent. The epitome of a Mandolorian.
Yuuzhan Vong and a swoop gang. What had he gotten himself into when joining up with these three. It probably wouldn't be the last time he asked himself that question. He just watch quietly, hand resting comfortably of him pistol grip. It seemed Terric had made some sort of deal with both sides and apparently came out ahead on both ends. The small one might not be the toughest of the three but he wasn't someone to ignore without consequences. Hew hoped this wouldn't go on forever he was tired and all this work wasn't getting him one credit closer to his goal.

"**I trust in the future we will have your *full cooperation* when we…request your services**?" Kel says all the while never taking his gaze off the Yuzzem.
"**I could have easily pulled a freighter from the sky if I so wished it, but I believe this will suffice**" Kel informs the Yuzzem. "**Terric, has our business concluded? We need to prepare for our next mission.**" With that Kel takes his gaze off Kozza and returns to the transport.

The Shaper Yim passes a villip to Terric as Kozza's eyes widen at Kel's boast. They soon narrow again as if doubting the claim, but it is plain that he will not test it. The bikers welcome their lost brethren and Kozza trades information with Yim before leading his group away.
Terric, Kel, and Uyric had almost reached the speeder when they notice Zun's absence, who they spot amongst the Vong. The tattooed giant waves them away, then turns to walk with the Vong, quickly disappearing from view.
A short flight later sees the trio back to the hotel, and two days pass as Terric heals. On the third morning, a knock at the door reveals two bikers carrying Zun. The giant bears markings of the Embrace, and odd, tiny bite marks along his neck, as well as a new-grown suit of Vonduun Crabshell armor. He sleeps for twelve hours before rising to eat for three.

Terric is in his room meditating and levitating small objects. The objects dance around the room in circles and spirals. The objects spiral closer together finally making a helix pattern in front of him before gently setting down on the floor. With a yawn and a stretch he gets up and walks over to the arena pad sitting on the desk. He sits down and starts searching through the matches offered seeing if any seem like they would be a challenge for them. He also scans the scheduled matches looking for signs of their Jedi target.

Kel spends the two days in quiet meditation, coming out of his room occasionally to eat and practice. When he is in the common room to eat, he is quiet. On the second day, during a meal he speaks to Uyric.
"**Mandolorian, I require your… assistance; I need a sparring partner. I feel what I have in mind will benefit us both. Are you opposed to this idea? Neither of us will be harmed and both of us stand to gain knowledge of our future opponent. Will you agree to spar**?" Kel says, choking back the words 'assistance'.

Uyric almost chokes on his popkin when Kel asked for assistance. He covered it well though. Snarfing down the rest of it he listens to the Sith's idea.
**"Yea I think I'd be ok with some sparring. You wanna take a go now or what?"**
He looked forward to the challenge from what he had heard Jedi and Sith were some of the most deadly fighters in the known galaxy. He was definitely up for facing those odds and seeing where he came out.
**"I hope your not one of those Sith with an anger issue. If you start raging out on me or something cause you don't like how the sparring is going….well lets just not find out where that throught line goes shall we."**
Grinning he wipes the bread crumbs from his mouth and waits for a response.

### **Snowkrash** (2011-06-10 14:38:43)

Kel regards Uyric's comments for a moment and then speaks.
"**Anger is different from rage. Rage is a loss of control. Once you have lost control, then you have failed. I do not rage and I do not lose control. Which will be part of the exercise, control and adaptability"** Kel says, letting Uyric absorb that information.
"**Set your weapons to stun. The objective will be to attack to me, and counter when I attack. In this instance, by my sparring with a Mandolorian, I will better understand a well trained opponent and what to expect from someone who has superior combat training. You will benefit because you need will need to adapt at every turn, giving you insight into how a Jedi will attempt to best you, using the Force as his ally. Are you ready?**" Kel motions to the main room.
"**You, stand over there**" Kel points to the opposite of the end room. Kel moves to the opposite side of the room from Uyric.
"**Ready yourself; you may use any weapons that have a stun setting. Never rely on any one weapon, and know that a Jedi relies heavily on his use of the Force. Overcome the Jedi and the Force will be no longer be his ally. For this exercise, I will not be using my pike. Let me know when you are prepared**" Kel says, and with he takes a long meditative breath, and sets himself in a defensive stance, facing Uyric.

Terric's eyes pop open and the lightsaber flicks from his dresser into his hand. The blaster bolt had come from the living room. He gets up and slides across the room like a shadow. Easing the door open he looks out into the room. He is surprised to see that it's Kel and the Mandolorian fighting in the living room. A quick look at Kel's face tells him whats going on.

Kel reaches out with the Force and attempts to grasp the weapon, but catches Uyric's arm instead. Thankfully, this is enough to throw off the Mando's aim and prevent the stun bolt from catching Kel directly in the head.

Parts of the set are still Imperial Knight issue, but a helmet has been added, as well as bulkier gauntlets and boots, and more plating. The helmet is reminiscent of both Mandalorian design and older Imperial Coruscant Guard armor. His statistics are shown off to the right of the screen, next to the holo.

There isn't anything wrong with abandoning a fight you can't win. Being force to fight in a confined space by yourself against a trained Sith was one of those things you shouldn't do.

Kel releases the effect on Uyric. He looks the Mandolorian over, and nods to him.
"**There is no shame in conceding. Live and return to take your revenge another day. I believe that a single combat veteran such as yourself, will pose no immediate threat, my brother or myself. Though a well organized squad of them might prove to be a formidable opponent. Something I will keep in mind for our next encounter. My advice for you is this: those who wield the Force need concentration in order to effectively use its power. Disrupt that concentration by…any…means…necessary, and you too will be among those who will have the pleasure of besting a Jedi in single combat. Take the away the Force from a Jedi, and what you have is a defenseless fool, who would easily break under the pressure of torture and subjugation. Never forget that. You combat skills are commendable and you bring honor to your clan with your ability and prowess. You have my respect, Mandolorian.**" Kel says.
Kel gives Uryic very serious stare and says "**Never mistake that for trust**."
Kel performs a bow of respect and then straightens up. He walks over to Terric, to see what scheme he has already begun to plot.
'*His plots are always so intriguing*' Kel thinks to himself.

**"Kel tells you untruth. Jedi may rely on the Force, but true Sith do not. Let a few days pass and I'll prove it. No saber, no Force,"** Zun says as he leans back and belches, stretching his massive frame. **"I am bored, brother. Tell me you have something for us,"** he says to Terric.
Terric's time on the Arena-Pad is well spent as he finishes the profile for the Scum Dogs and begins finding information on Severn. From what he can see, all Severn's one on one matches have ended in deaths. The only time there are survivors is when Severn participates in team matches. Apparently, on the higher Tiers, team matches are rarely to the death, allowing teams to improve and thus bringing more money from a larger stable of teams. Severn runs with a group of Mandalorians during his team matches, a clan, who's name is Ka'rta. Looking up the Ka'rta team shows Terric a group that ranges from nine to twenty (depending on match) Mandalorians, and judging by their equipment, they are very wealthy Mandalorians. Where Severn acquired his new armor is evident now, as they wear similar. Severn's helmet is unique though.
As Terric reads further he notices a notification light blinking on the datapad's upper corner. Checking it, it is a message that the Scum Dogs have been challenged by two separate teams.
The Urg'gak'mut'hat'ta, a family of Gammoreans, with eight-thousand credits worth of weaponry, livestock, and semi-precious metals and a purse of 4,000 credits.

He takes a seat next to the smallest of the three Sith and glances over his shoulder while he works. Looking at the messages he smiles at the thought of an E-web. The bigger purse of the Gamoreans finally sealed the deal for him though.

Once out on the street he waves, and shortly an older but well kept stretch speeder breaks and lands beside him, and he opens the passenger compartment for the group. As he passes Howl, the big Wookie hands Terric a datapad.
Once all are seated the divider between the pilot's compartment and the passenger's lowers to show a Darkstar Hellion at the helm, an unshaved human who grunts, **"Where too boss?"** to no one in particular.
**"Tier Six Arena One,"** Zun replies, and the divider rises and the speeder takes off slowly and gains speed. Looking at the datapad, Terric sees a few brief lines of text: *A token of my appreciation, Lord Terric. This speeder will be available any time you need it. Simply wave when out in front of your hotel.* Signed in Kozza's name. The interior of the speeder was once luxurious, and has been kept in decent repair. An ill stocked mini-bar lines one side, and the benches provide ample seating for the four with room for more.

**"You will be in pit 3 sir. Please present wagers,"** the droid tells Terric. As the quartet gathers round Terric's Arena-Pad beeps, signaling the end of its search. As Terric reads, Zun grumbles, **"Strategy, brother?"** in response to Kel. **"They're Gammoreans. What could they know of strategy? Mere beasts, easily led to slaughter."**
The information soon puts the lie to Zun's words though. Terric finds several write-ups and one short video clip on The Urg'gak'mut'hat'ta, a family of Gamorreans. It consists of one female and her five husbands, something common of the natives of Gamor. The females are larger, stronger, and more importantly, much more intelligent than the males. According to the articles, this family are a controlled and methodical exercise in brutality. Far from mindless animals, they have never lost a man and have won all five of their matches. In the short holo-clip, Terric can see several males surrounding a large droid. One carries a massive and oddly balanced axe, the others wickedly hooked and large sized blades. The axe-wielder steps forward and cleaves the droid's leg off, and his brother in-laws quickly swarm the hobbled droid, toppling and rendering it to bare scrap in a matter of seconds.
The droid finishes scanning all the wagered items and approves them. As they turn to follow the droid's directions to the pit, Terric and Kel can feel an immense anxiety and hunger flooding the building as the crowds mass for the coming battle.

There was an old mando saying "No plan survives contact with your enemy." and it would probably apply here as well. Taking out the brains of the operation was always a decent strategy.
**"I don't plan on letting any of them near me if possible. Shoot and Move keeps you alive my daddy always said, usually while shooting at me during my morning training."**
He chuckles to himself at the memory.
**"If she is as smart or at least as cunning as she seems she won't make herself an easy target. She will probably hang back behind her husbands. She has a few to spare it seems."**

Kel smiles menacingly, revealing white teeth against dark skin.
"**Uryic, do you have any explosive devices that could be detonated behind her husbands, thereby creating confusion in their ranks? If we can throw them into a state of chaos, I can move into deal with their matriarch. Without a squad leader, the squad will run amok without purpose. What are your thoughts, Uyric?**" Kel asks while keeping an eye on the arena.
"**If you can divert their forces away from her, my brothers and I can make short work of their leader. Would you not agree, Zun**?" Kel says looking at all of them.

Kel grins at Uryic.
'*The Mandolorians were truly bred for war, how clever of him. Improvisation with a stun grenade, interesting. We may make a Sith mercenary out of him yet.*' Kel thinks to himself.
Kel removes one of the stun grenades from his harness and hands it t Uryic. Kel watches Uryic goto work on the device; taking mental notes along the way.

Moving into a less crowded alley way so he can work in relative peace and to offer some safety to pedestrians if this goes wrong. Uyric takes out his two extra fuel cells and and some rigging tape. Kneeling down he carefully lays the cells down and starts dismantling the stun grenade. He slowly slides out the detention mechanism and tosses the rest back to Kel. Using some olf fashion Jiggery-pokery he assembles something that resembles a satchel charge.
**"So the basic idea is that the charge used to detonate the stun grenade will now detonate these two fuel cells hopefully creating a small fuel air explosive. That is if it doesn't prematurely detonate and kill us all."**

Plans and bombs made, the quartet soon finds themselves faced with an Arena employee who explains the basics. **"Once the gates open, you go get your murder on. When its done you leave the corpses alone, we'll deliver your winnings to you, and you'll have the option to speak to the crowd. Got it? Good luck,"** instructions given, they find themselves in the cage as the announcer introduces the combatants.
**"COME ONE, COME ALL TO THE KILLEE-KOR ARENA!!! TODAY WE HAVE THE URG'GAK'MUT'HAT'TA, THOSE MAESTROS OF BRUTALITY VERSUS THE SCUM-DOGS OF THE UNIVERSE, THE BRAVE UNDERDOGS!!! THESE TWO PROMISING TEAMS ARE HERE TO BLEED FOR US!!! SHOW THEM THAT YOU LOVE THEM, BECAUSE AFTER TODAY, ONE WON'T BE HERE ANYMORE!!!"** The announcer pauses to allow the quickly growing crowd to roar and scream, the seats almost full already. **"LET THE BATTLE BEGIN!!!"**
As the cage opens they get their first look at the pit, a wide open area with scattered barricades, a pit, and a section of shattered floor. Across the pit they can see a group of large, powerfully built Gammoreans, three of which hold what seem like bent cleavers, two of which hold axes with gigantic heads, and the last, the female leader, wearing armor made from what appears to be starship hull and carrying a rather large rifle.
Zun, his bravado quieted somewhat, holds himself in check, asking, **"Where do you want me, brothers?"**

**"I will prime the charge and it will take a few moments to build a charge. I'll drop it here behind cover and when they close use your force abilities to move it towards them."**

Take cover and close the distance. Use the terrain to your advantage and make them spoil for a large target. Once, the device has been denoted, confusion and chaos will fill their ranks, move in and slaughter them. Terric, use your speed and cunning to split their fire; the more targets they see, the less attention that will be on our efforts, the easier it will be to successfully complete our portion of the mission**" Kel says as he starts off behind the large crate where Uryic had taken cover at.

Uyric can feel the heat begin to radiate out from the device in a smooth, controlled pattern as he sets it to the floor. Kel and Terric can feel the Force swirling about Zun as he harnesses its power to make himself stronger, a slightly maniacal look in his eyes as he strides forward, placing himself in the open with saber drawn.
From the far side of the pit a series of short grunts and squeals can be heard as the female shows herself, muscling through her husbands to the fore. The female has a burning intelligence and quick cunning in her beady eyes, and is unusually small for a Gammorean sow, being slightly smaller than her brutish husbands. She is nonetheless powerful though, as her movements seem barely hampered by the thick heavy armor she wears and weapons she carries. She levels the large rifle in her hands with a practiced ease, firing at the largest open target, Zun. The shot misses, but this doesn't seem to provoke any reaction in her or her husbands.
Like a well oiled machine her husbands react in concert to her grunted commands, moving forward as one but not rushing their opponents in a frenzy. She looses a high pitched squealing roar and her husbands echo it in concert. The husbands fall into a staggered line, working together flawlessly, each a gigantic pile of muscle lightly padded with blubber, easily handling the dead weight of the large simple weapons in their hands.

The bomb rockets away as if hurled by a catapult. Not knowing when the thing was going to go blow throwing it as soon as possible was probably the safest move.

The bomb rockets forward, moved by an unseen force, impacting the middle husband in the forehead. The massive creature stops, shocked at the odd occurrence, and his brother-in-laws stop with him, mystified. Zun watches expectantly, then glances from Terric to Kel, and finally to Uyric with a look of confusion on his face. His features harden, and he looses a vile curse in Sith before swapping to Basic, **"You'd better hope, brothers, that I can hold the line, otherwise your bomb will detonate behind them,"** he throws his cloak back, revealing the sheen of new growth that is his new armor, reverses his grip on his lightsaber, and charges into the fray. His battle cry is ferocious, and he leaps the last few feet, his body forming a bow in the air, contracting and bringing his weight and the power of his massive frame into play on the blow, stabbing downward at the husband struck by the bomb. The big pig, seeing it coming, simply steps back and allows the Sith's weapon to gouge the floor in front of him, a sicking grin stretching across his face.
Uyric rockets into the air, scoring a direct hit on the porcine female, drawing a squeal of pain. The sow wastes little time moving closer to her husbands, and quickly Uyric finds a hail of fire from her rifle coming his way. Which misses but not by far.
*The first husband takes a step forward, swinging his massive unbalanced axe. The blow makes Zun stumble, hobbling him badly. The second husband swings around to come at Zun from the rear, his axe biting deeply as well. Naked pain shows on Zun's face, and a small hint of fear at the power of the blows.
The third husband steps forward, but his form is sloppy and careless, even in his shaken position Zun easily avoids the slash of his wickedly hooked blade. The fourth husband, the one Zun had missed and Terric had hit in the face with a bomb, apparently doesn't have his balance back yet, as he too misses. The open frustrated rage in Zun's eyes is plain, the warrior had never seen such teamwork coupled with such brutality before. The fifth and last husband takes advantage of Zun's distraction and scores a comparatively light hit to the giant's back. As the third and last blow lands the rage becomes dismay, and the mighty Zun crumples, his frame lost behind the bulk of Gammorean around him.*
All of this plays through Zun's mind's eye, and he takes great pains to avoid that first attack, knowing that should it succeed he would surely fall in this pit. He jerks to the side, avoiding the massive Arg'garok. Once it was avoided he finds it easier to rely on his natural abilities to avoid the other ceremonial axe and the cruelly hooked swords of the lesser husbands. Zun fights for his life, and the rage on his face is plain for all to see.

Uyric tilts and rockets forward, aiming to finish off the female. His shot lashes out, merely to fizzle on the chest plate of her thick armor. She tosses her head, dozens of braids flying with the movement, and tries to return the favor. Uyric finds the sheer power output of her rifle to match its size as the bolt catches him in the chest, making him dip and sway wildly for a few seconds.
Terric moves forward, trying desperately to draw some attention from his beleaguered colleague. His bellow causes the husband closest to him to misstep, giving him the opening he needs...
Zun flies into a Force enhanced fury, lashing out at what he perceives to be his largest threat, saber humming through the air like a vicious kuta beetle. His fury pays off as his blade digs into Gammorean flesh, burning and sizzling through the fat as he rakes the blade back and forth, refusing to die. **"I.. AM… NO…."** the giant roars defiantly, punctuating each sawing motion of his blade. **"EASY MEAT!!!!"** he screams as he tears his blade free of the gaping wound in the massive pig creature, scorched fat and boiling blood flying from his saber in an arc across his opponents.
The gang of husbands around Zun pay little mind to the antics of his allies, focusing on the armored Sith arrogant enough to challenge them. Only two score Zun's new armor, and the warrior's Force prowess keeps him alive through what would easily kill a lesser being.

Uyric flies forward again, coming to hover over one of the large crates. He levels his pistol, and as he does the pit erupts into chaos as his bomb engulfs the melee in flames. He pauses a second, looking for his target, finding the massive sow still standing and fires, his bolt catching her at the joint of her thick armor near collar, and with a deafening squeal the leader of the mighty Urg'gak'mut'hat'ta falls. The husbands will weakens at the sound, their attacks becoming less coordinated, all save one.
Terric sees his opportunity in the flaming, screaming mass and steps forward, directly behind Zun's target. With casual and elegant, almost careless, flick his saber comes up and lashes through the wounded Gammorean's skull, its tip extruding from his left eye. With nary a sound Terric withdraws the blade and the great beast-warrior falls, flames licking up from his remains.
Kel, seeing his intended target fall from the Mandalorian's expert shot, redirects his focus to the next closest target, taking his own weakness and making it his power, as all true Sith do. He feels his target's mind weaken under the weight of the fear. Unfortunately, these creatures are well accustomed to fear, and to fighting on through it. The husband's heavy, unbalanced axe still rises towards Zun.
Zun stands with legs braced and blood red blade gripped in two hands, Dark Side induced rage upon him. He turns and strikes, frothing spittle making it to his flaming armor only to evaporate in a hiss of steam as the flames of the bomb dance about him. The roaring giant presents a frightening image as he stands with his entire body aflame and it has no effect on him whatsoever. The Gammoreans around him quail visibly at this monster in their midst. His blade bites deeply into the last axe wielding husband, and thanks to Kel's Force trickery, that husband is unable to rally his resources before attempting to return the favor Zun did him. Without the confidence granted by his wife and master, and the aid of his now dead brother, his axe fails to find purchase. As his axe falls on empty air he succumbs to the flames and falls.
The last three husbands continue to wage war on the Sith amongst them, only one finding purchase with his blade. The flames eat hungrily at the flesh of all in the conflagration. With so many bodies falling all together the crowd stands and begins to chant the underdogs' name, **"SCUM-DOGS, SCUM-DOGS, SCUM-DOGS, SCUM-DOGS!!!"**

Fourth Round, boom. Frost rolled 16 damage. All parties in range take damage, which is everyone but Terric, Uyric, and Kel. All are also on fire, which will take effect at the end of their turns on each round. The female was still standing, but Uyric's attack dropped her. With out damage from both sources she would still be up. H2 is dead, Frost broke damage threshold like a champ with that crit. Kel, I had you target H1 since the female is down. You would have failed on her anyway. You beat his Will but only hit the base DC of reducing him to only a standard action, which still allows him to attack. DT, for this fight we're gonna go by RaW, which is no. I may make a house rule later though cause that's a question I've asked before. Might add a talent to the Rocket Jumper tree to that effect.

Uyric watches the with grim satisfaction as the bomb does what it was meant to do. Despite some small glitches the plan was working perfectly. Maintaining altitude he swings around towards Terric's side. The flames send up roiling black smoke that obscures his vision and his shot gets nowhere near its target.

Kel watches the female flee for better combat position. Her mind was stronger than he thought.
'*No matter, you left your meat shields to die at my hand…and so they shall. They will not stand against us*' Kel thinks to himself.
"**Uyric, the female has moved beyond my reach…she is yours, SLAY HER!**" Kel says with zeal.
Rage builds inside of him; rage burning like the heat of 1000 stars; the power of the force wells up inside of him and is channeled through sheer willpower at the unsuspecting Gamorrean.

To Zun's left, wicked tendrils of Dark Side enhanced lightning reach from Kel's hands and consume the Gammorean there, filling the air with an unbelievable stench. Zun watches his enemies fall and his maddened roaring turns to sadistic laughter as his flaming form twists, bringing his blade to bare on the porcine being between he and his brother. Terric's blade scores a deep wound, causing the creature to squeal in pain and try to turn and face his attacker. As he does Zun's blade catches him, sinking several centimeters into the flesh, horizontally, of its chest. It crumples, Zun's blade shearing off a large portion of meat. Watching his brother's fall and seeing himself suddenly outnumbered and surrounded, the last husband's movements seem mechanical and half hearted, resigned to the doom that awaits him at the hands of the Sith...
Screams from the crowd fill the air at the display of Force mastery, and the cheering gains in volume with each felled member of the Urg'gak'mut'hat'ta, reaching a thunderous crescendo as the last one stands...

Terric moves quickly into the gap left by the fallen piglets. He hopes to be the anvil to Zun's hammer. His red blade flashing as he moves to strike. His footing slips slightly in all the Gamorean blood and entrails that litter the ground and his swing comes across as slightly wild.

The crowd begins to roar as Uyric's blaster downs the last of the Gammorreans, then quiets as Kel walks forward and uses the Force to contort and crush the body. As the wet popping noises dies Zun throws both flaming arms in the air, turning to the crowd and roaring at the top of his lungs. The incomprehensible noise of the crowd becomes wall shaking cheers at the cruelty displayed and the flaming warrior.
**"SO ENDS THE WINNING STREAK OF THE URG'GA… URG'GAK-GA… THE GAMMORREANS!!! THE SCUM DOGS OF THE UNIVERSE HAVE TRIUMPHED!!!"** the announcer says as a droid approaches with a cred chip in one hand and a transmitter in the other. Several other droids move among the remains.
Zun stands erect, shoulders back and head high, flames still licking at his massive frame. He walks forward and casually dips his hands in the remains of Terric's kill, using the gore to snuff out the flames slowly. The crowd at first seems stunned, but then livens, cheering on the vulgar act. Zun turns with a wide grin, **"We are home brothers. Can you feel the power of this place?"** The Dark Side energies are rampant in the pit: wild, unrefined and coarse. It crashes overwhelmingly on the senses.

Seeing the final Gamorrean going down under the massive assault directed towards him, Uyric launches himself even higher. Spinning with his arms stretched out in pure exaltation of victory. Bringing himself to a stop in midair he cuts the pack a lets himself fall backwards in a free fall. A few meters before the ground he reinstates the pack just enough to bring him safely to the ground. He joins his allies offering pats on the back and victory celebration.

Between the light show, the aerobatics, and the gore the crowd comes alive at Terric's words. Nothing, not even the gladiator's own heartbeats, can be heard over the roar. The triumphant four stand and soak it in as the droids continue their work. As two droids approach laden with weapons and gear Zun directs them outside to the gladiators' waiting speeder. Another droid approaches Terric and hands him a datacard showing proof of ownership and location of the rest of the Gammorreans' wager.
Slowly the noise level begins to die and the crowds begin to drift away. Another droid crew comes in and begins the cleaning process to prepare the pit for its next match.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Team Fame is now 3. Congratulations. Part of their wager (the weapons) is now being loaded into your speeder, and Terric has the means to claim the rest. Frost, there are three ways you can handle the other goods. 1: delegate them to the Dark-Stars with a chance of getting their value. 2: sell them at value yourself with a series of Persuasion checks; and 3: RP selling them if you want the opportunity to upsell for more than their value. The options are listed in order of time taken to accomplish the task. The weapons that were part of the wager are: 1 heavy blaster rifle, 2 arg'garoks and 3 dire swords for a total of 2600 credits. The other 5400 of their wager is in livestock and various metals.

**"Is there somewhere we can store the animals and such till we can find a buyer? I'm sure the hotel would frown on keeping a Nerf in the lobby."**

Kel considers Terric's proposal.
"**Terric, I see wheels turning inside your mind. I am in agreement; we should equip the Swoop Gang. At our mission crescendo, we will need allies. I believe this gang will suffice for our needs.**" Kel smiles, giving Terric approving nod at his thinking.
"**I can take these goods to a dealer who will give us a good if not a fair price, for whatever items are not distributed among the Swoop gang.**."

Turning he leads the Scumdogs out of the arena. As Kel leads him through the streets he says almost to himself but loud enough for Kel to hear.
**"We should find someone to place bets for us outside the arena so we get more pay every time we win. Yes."**

The four quickly find themselves out at the speeder, which lifts off and swings by the hotel to drop of Zun and Uyric. It then heads off, following Kel's directions to Goodo's Miscellany and Supply. As Kel and Terric enter with two heavy bags full of Gammorean weaponry from their recent match, Drujo Sans comes from behind his counter with a gleeful look in his greedy eyes on recognizing Kel. **"Ah my Lord, my lord has returned! What manner of spoils and conquests do you have today?"**
Terric lays eyes on Drujo for the first time and sees almost a kindred soul. A silver tongue and quick wit, although this one is controlled by his fear instead of driven by it. Drujo Sans is a middle-aged and well appointed Twi'lek, with fine robes covering his soft hide.
------------------------------------
Zun and Uyric make their way to the room, where Zun orders a large meal to be sent up. He quickly begins stripping off his armor and arranging it for cleaning. **"I hope those two return successfully and swiftly. I have need of those credits,"** he says as he begins wiping down his crabshell armor with a variety of chemicals.

Terric took in the shop as he chatted with the arms dealer examining it with a keen eye. He lays out the weapons some still filthy with dried blood. On instinct he also reaches out with the force to feel the area around them.

Kel enters in and greets Drujo, as cordially as his personality will allow.
**“Drujo Sans, I find myself in your shop again. I have brought the spoils of a most bloody and harrowing battle. I could have sold them to any Jawa or Toydarian on the street; though loyalty and the familiar comfort of a trustworthy soul brought me back here…to tell you the tale. The tale of the Four**” Kel says, waiting for the visual cues in Drujo’s face to continue.
“**Four Gamorrean males and their lone female mate conspired to do battle against the Four. The Four, whom the Gamorreans knew they outnumbered, who thought they could stand against the power of the Sith and their Mandalorian mercenary. The odds were stacked against the Four. The Gamorreans plotted to separate and eliminate each of the Four, one at time, baiting them into simplest of follies. The female was extremely cunning and her husbands would fight to the death at her command, an advantage that female knew she clearly had**” Kel’s hands moved his hands in the air, as if were painting the picture for Drujo.
“**Heavily armed and extremely dangerous, the Gamorreans began their attack, forcing the Four to scatter to winds. Slowly, the Gamorreans pressed their advantage; blaster bolts light the noon day sky; the Mandalorian took to the air to avoid any stray, random fire. The mighty Zun, dashed in and single-handedly engaged the Gamorreans in hand to hand combat. His saber, a red blur in their midst. The clever Terric silently carried a deadly and potentially unstable homemade bomb, to flank and force them into position, all the while they were distracted by the roar and flashing lightsaber of Zun. From the air, the Mandalorian rained death from the sky as blaster bolts and rockets flew from his arsenal**” Kel says accenting the story with his hands and fingers making gestures of rockets and explosions.
“**The bomb that Terric had planted behind their defenses, detonated and their forces were laid open, confused and disoriented. Zun, with his lightsaber hacked and slashed, and bodies piled before him, like heaps of garbage. And then…then Kel came…with terror of the Sith. Lightning flashed from his fingers and his enemies were crushed by the awesome power of the Force. The dead lay before them, broken and conquered; the crowds roar was deafening and only the Four stood, blackened, bloody and victorious…**” Kel’s hands go by his side as he falls silent. His eyes look up and pierce Drujo’s expression.
“**All that remains of the Gamorreans, lie in these sacks. The relics of their failed attempt at challenging the Four; relics that will live in memory and holo-vid transmissions, relics that now, only Drujo Sans has access to…**” Kel pauses for a moment to read Drujo and then continues. “**Make me an offer Drujo and be the envy of every shop keeper in the city, nay…on the planet!**” Kel emphasizes his point by pressing down an index finger on the counter and leaning in closer to Drujo.

Uyric begins breaking down his own armor and cleaning it. He takes his time and makes sure it's polished to a nice shine.
**"I thought the force provided everything you needed? What do you need credits for? Got a hot date with a Vong shaper?"**
He says it in a joking matter as he starts breaking down his weapon as well.
**"I thought we may have been in trouble there for a few moments. I have some burn cream in my medkit if you want it."**
