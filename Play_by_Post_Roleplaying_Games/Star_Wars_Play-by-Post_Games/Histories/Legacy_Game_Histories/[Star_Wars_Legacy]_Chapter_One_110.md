Star Wars: Legacy
War Journals
Data recovery incomplete ...... initializing feed ..... poor to no signal ......
Seven years ago, the empire attacked. They where not alone, Sith filled their ranks, filled their hatred.
Without mercy they assaulted your home planet, you can still remember the day the sky went dark. Ships too many to count descended through the cloud cover, there was no warning.
Sirens of alarm rang though, but it was too little too late. What meager defences that could be mustered where swept away within minutes.
The governors voice replaced the sirens "People of Aloon, we are in a state of emergency. With all haste please head for the nearest space port ships are gathering to ...." his voice was replaced with a angry hissing sound followed by."People of the doomed world Aloon, there is no escape no surrender, only the will of Darth Krayt".
It was a voice of pure evil something you will never, can never forget. This was the day you all became orphans, this was the day you lost your family, friends, innocence.
It all became a dream after that, a nightmare. You barely remember getting to a ship, only that many died ensuring that the ship would take off. The last thing you ever saw of Aloon as leaving its atmosphere was that of a single Jedi.
From the distance you could not make out race or gender, a brilliant blue light cutting down waves of assailants. Your escorts fighters fell like snarl flies on a frigid day, more and more waves of the enemy came at the jedi ......
For months after that day you limped from system to system, seeking refuse only to be turned away. The captain of the ancient MC-40, the Last Hope renamed after that dark day says that the system governors don`t want to get involved scared that their planet could be next for harbouring refuges.
Planet after planet turned your ship away, until finally out of fuel and credits the Last Hope drifted into an empty region of space. Floating for years the brave crew of the Last Hope did all they could to provide food and shelter, until an asteriod belt was discovered, unclaimed and mineral rich the Last Hope and her passengers settled here as space miners hiding from an enemy that may never come.
Deep within Hutt space you were allowed to settle in exchange the Last Hope would pay the Hutts taxes. Over the years the taxes took there toll on the crew, though you are all free your debts have forced your labour for many more years to come. The Last Hope herself had seen better days, now she rests half buried into an moon sized asteroid, sheltering the last of Aloon`s people.

The buzz around Hope`s End has been high of late. Blotus the Hutt has made contact with the station and will dock, a tax collection appointment his ship will be arriving soon. Everyone has pulled together working double and sometimes triple shifts in an attempt to meet the sizable Hutts quota, the work is hard but spirits are high and the people of Hope`s End have always pulled through.
As a group you are working in mine section B sub level 4 when Anazider calls out " Good work, lets call it in for today" marking the end of a third double shift in a row. Automatic repulsor carts dart back and forth, modified to haul ore weary miners trudge into and out of the nearby sections. As if to confirm Anazider`s statement the whistle signals marking the change of shift.
((You all make your way to the lifts this is a several minute walk, the lifts will take you to the main levels and the changing rooms. From there you can go about your daily lives, through the walk take this time to in game chatter, and a lil intro on each other.))
_________________
Thandrim
Thandrim drops the latest and last rock of the shift into a passing cart and looks to where Anazider stands. 'Punctual as always' he says quietly to no one in particular. A moment's pause is given to roll his neck about upon the shoulders, dust his hands of a touch unleashing a small cloud of particles. Finally the young man turns and begins to head toward his section's foreman. One hand takes hold of the filter mask covering the mouth and pulls it free and down, letting it hang about the neck now.
"Another full day's exercise completed, hmm? I do hope the processing crews do not understate the quality of the ore taken in this time." Thandrim gives the words in a rather passive tone, with perhaps just a touch of hope instead of the sarcasm another being might have placed into that statement. Not quite done with the local particle population, the young man ruffles a hand through already unrully hair sending more dust floating down about him and leaving his eyes almost hidden by the chaotic mass of hair.
_________________
chibiamy
There is a grunt from beneath one of the carts, before it starts to whir and buzz lifting a little higher off the ground, before moving switftly and efficiently away with it's loaded oar. Kali lays where she is, back to the ground, pulling her goggles from her dust covered face. Then both hands flop to the sides as she sighs, momentarily trying to relax.
Then reality returns. Eyes close and Kali sits up, with a hand to her head. "Do you ever QUIT with the optimism," she practically grunts at Thandrim before standing up. Kali's eyes dart tot he young man, almost suspiciously as her dirt-covered face seems to turn a bit grey, even in the light of the mines. "Work's done. I'm outta here," she states abruptly and starts to march for the exit, only to pause, grumbling about forgetting her favorite spanner.
------------------------
Anazider
The falleen prince stands near the entrance of the mine shaft, taking a head count and reports from each of the miners as they come out. When Anazider had first started working with the crew of the Last Hope, working with his hands had been a novelty. There was a certain pride one could take in gleening something of worth from so much rubble.
...But after seven years, the novelty had well worn off. The nobleman still fretted over the shabby state of his wardrobe and lack of a proper manicurist, but it was more to remind him of his noble heritage rather than being a true lament.
"Another full day's exercise completed, hmm? I do hope the processing crews do not understate the quality of the ore taken in this time."
To Anazider, Thandrim was an enigma. The man managed to keep details about his past well guarded, when Anazider prided himself on being able to ferret information out of just about anyone. And the human managed to maintain a level of optimism that bordered on the obscene. Over the years the falleen prince had developed a very grudging respect for Thandrim, and viewed him with amused sarcasm.
"I would have figured this work to have robbed you of such good will, over the years, such is the nature of the task. But perhaps you've found a more proper... motivation, yes?"
Anazider passes a knowing look from Thandrim to Kali, as he offers the woman a wink that he knows will ruffle her feathers. He continues onward towards the lift, entering information from the shift into a datapad.
-------------------------------------
Rowen
Garik takes a deep breath and leans heavily on his pick. He was used to hard labor but the work at the mine seemed to clear his head and his soul. The resounding clink, clink, clink of picks was medicinal and allowed him to enter a mediation of sorts. Often he would venture to a part of the mine away from the rest of the workers. Not wishing to take part in the banter of his fellow comrades but to instead find peace within himself.
He stretched and worked his shoulder's in small circles to relieve tension, layed his pick in its usual spot and slowly made his way to the others. He shuffled up just in time to hear Thandrim and Kali's exchange, a smile crossed his lips. It had been quite a while since he had gotten as close to anyone and these two were quickly growing on him.
He nodded to Anazider as he approached and wiped the sweat from his brow and neck with a small towel he kept in his back pocket. His smile widened to a grin when he saw the wink given to Kali. "Ive grown rather fond of all of them." He thought to himself. "There's no denying it any longer." He sighed and continued to walk with them, content with just being in there company.
---------------------------------------
Thandrim
Turning to regard his fellow seventeen year old, Thandrim quirks his head slightly to one side in a gesture that is almost seen too often when regarding her. "As I have reminded you before Kalaria Sein, I am not an optimist. Merely a realist, and the universe is less dismal than you desire to see it." Those brown eyes take in the foreman next while one hand works it's endless quest to remove strands of hair from before Thandrim's vision.
"Motivation certainly foreman Anazider. I still recall your financial assessment and outlook report of six weeks ago. Unless I miscalculate, we have surpassed the goals set. Which itself should mean increased profits and a swifter end to our debts." Thandrim takes on a quiet smile as he goes on. "Which means the colony as a whole should be able to start making actual profit despite Hutt taxation. Which leads to the purchase of droids to work and the people to withdraw from here as they wish." There is no mention of what Anazider was eluding to, nor a sign that Thandrim even made that connection on any level. Similarly, there is no mention of his own growing desire, growing need, to leave the Last Hope. There is no passion; there is Serenity
All of this is capped off by a pleasant smile to the Zabrak as he approaches the lift. "I trust you found a particularly rich vein again today Garic? Somehow you always do seem to produce the best results when you are alone." There is little doubt the foremen and managers would like that everyone who 'took alone time' in the mines actually increased production rather than decreased. The young human dusts his shirt and pants off a little further as the wait. Then with a curious look up at the people around he queries, "Where is miss Venn?"
--------------------------------------------
simplyscribed
"Miss Venn". How the woman in question would laugh if she had heard that comment. In her mid twenties now, trapped within the mining colony with only her guard responsibilities and-on busy occasions such as this one-actual, back-breaking labour, she had begun to feel herself old before her time. Certainly in personality if not in physical fitness.
Alishai appeared from among the flow of workers, effortlessly stepping a path between them to the extremity of the crowd. Her expression was serene as such things go, the extra work she had been made to do over the last few days taken in nothing more than her usual stride.
A small smile flickered on the woman's lips as she spotted the group of people she considered friends, and she gave a wave that was no doubt surprisingly casual to everyone but them: Calm, handsome Anazider, made humbler by his time working the mines, though still hanging on to the trappings of his noble past; Silent, stoic Garic, who had a bigger heart than he would admit; Thandrim and Kali in particular she was fond of, having watched them grow and maybe even had a hand in it. Certainly they had needed responsible figures to guide them, and here she thought she had done some good. I might have failed the galaxy, but perhaps I'm not a complete loss yet.
None of them had seen her on that fateful day, dressed in the arms and armour of an Imperial Knight, she felt sure of that. Everyone had been too panicked, too busy, too focused on the Jedi outside the ship, fighting to the last to save them. She wondered again now as she did so often who it had been, and felt a fresh stab of pain in her breast. It wasn't him. She told herself, but it didn't make her feel any better. The guilt was stronger than the fear, the realisation that she should have been out there fighting too. But Marr had pushed her into the craft, and she had been helpless to fight against those rushing to board.
No, she had never told them, Had hidden away her armour and her lightsaber. She had not found an escape for herself so what was the point in giving them false hope? Or making enemies of them.
It was the one secret she kept from her friends, and it was the greatest secret of all.
Rearranging her suddenly sombre features into something more friendly, she reached the group and fell into step beside them.
-----------------------------------------------
chibiamy
From somewhere, from nowhere, a dirty rag sailed through the dim spaces of the mine for Thandrim. "What is WITH you and your ... I don't know, serenity, since you're not an optimist?" she asked of the man, before grabbing her spanner with a grunt. Stuffing it into her belt, Kali picked up a small rock that would be perfect for throwing at Thandrim later - no doubt he would deserve it, of course, then she turned and did not exactly hurry to catch up with the rest of the group.
Violet eyes flicked over everyone, widening at the wink from Anazider. It never failed, and the rock that Kali had collected to throw at Thandrim, went sailing at the zabrac, not that it was ever intended to hit the man, of course, quite easily missing. Then Kali shifted where she was walking, moving closer to Garic with a nod and a sniff. "Hey..." she offered before noticing Alishai's arrival. So, another nod was given the older woman as she stuffed her hands into dust-filled pockets.
Looking down at the route for a minute, Kali nibbled on her lower lip, frowning at nothing. She liked the group she was with, honestly, she did. No matter how infuriating they could be. They WERE nice to her. Just, lately, she'd felt so odd around some of them. Of course the queer feeling she got around Thandrim made Kali panic. She was NOT developing feelings for the blasted irritating man. She wouldn't allow herself to! But then she felt so odd around Alishai lately as well, just when she WANTED another female to talk to.
'Being seventeen SUCKS!' concluded Kali. 'Being seventeen and stuck mining on an asteroid sucks,' came the quick admendment.
------------------------------------------------------
Thandrim
It is a magical time. For as Alishai make herself appear out of the crowd, a rather used cloth rag also materializes upon Thandrim's shoulder just at the neck. Blinking twice the young man takes the cloth in hand with a curious eye before using a whip-like motion to free it of some of it's own cargo of dirt. Even as he does do, the youth looks in the direction where he believes it must have come from and says to no one in particular, "Thank you."
Clearly the human's face is dirtier than normal so someone tossed him a rag to help clean it. Very nice of them, whoever it was. And so Thandrim begins to use the rag to work some of the day's work off those facial features. Given the overal dirtiness of both face and cloth however, it does more smearing than actual cleaning. Nice 'face paint' patterns though.
--------------------------------------------------------
simplyscribed
Alishai notices Thandrim's attempts and lets out a theatrical sigh.
'Come here, lad.' She says, taking the rag from his hands and holding it out in front of him.
'I never thought I'd hear myself say this... I'm becoming my mother far too early stuck in this place. Spit.'

Weary, dirty miners file out of the mine shaft causing a bottle neck at the lifts. Just as Kali grabs her forgotten spanner, the rest of you drag your way down the mine shaft your replacements briskly walk past. All in various conversations:
-"Blotus the Hutt has landed, man that`s a fine ship."
-His goons look kind of ruff, I bet they have seen seen a fight or two."
-"This is routine Blotus docks his goons search the station they load the ore and leave."
-"Your right this time won`t be any different."
-"I heard that Captain Drefi is greeting Blotus now."
-"The Biddy Crate is coming in she will dock soon."
-"Lacy always brings in cool stuff from Sarlacc Station."
-"Hey did you see the new holo-vid Raiders of the lost Jedi temple?"
Their chatter becomes drowned out by the constant drone of mining equipment and the hum of repulsor carts. The fresh crew waves as they pass you by heading for the section you just left. Thinking to yourselves "This will be a day like any other, and once Blotus and his minions take their leave the colony can breath easier again."
------------------------------------------------------
Anazider
Thandrim's innocent responses, and Kalira's flustered protestations always provoked an honest humor from Anazider, it was a part of the reason why he associated with them. Years of negotiating the currents of Falleen royal politics and the cutthroat nature of the starship industry had bred a certain level of skepticism and distrust into the prince, and he found it very refreshing to deal with genuine people, even after seven years.
He offered a slight nod to Garic as the man joined their small procession, and a genuine smile to Alishai that only deepened when Thandrim refered to her as "Miss Venn". Alishai was another whose mysteries intrigued Anazider, but where Thandrim deflected questions about his past with absent-minded maunderings, the hazel-eyed woman kept herself guarded and reserved. This appealed to the prince, especially given the emotionally stoic nature of his people, and Anazider found himself paying more heed when Alishai spoke, even though he had lived more than twice her age.
"Blotus the Hutt has landed, man that`s a fine ship."
"His goons look kind of ruff, I bet they have seen seen a fight or two."
"This is routine Blotus docks his goons search the station they load the ore and leave."
--------------------------------------------------
Anazider
Anazider listened intently to the chatter coming from the inbound shift, even though he took on a look of disinterest. He always listened for news of the world outside of the mining colony, maintaining few of the connections he enjoyed before joining the crew of the Last Hope. The truth was that the prince was beginning to desire a departure from the blasted little rock, and had several opportunities, but fear of pursuit from by his father and bounty hunters in his employ stayed his hand. Anazider realized, though, that after seven years such fears were becoming flimsy at best.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rowen
He inclined his head toward Thandrim and spoke in a soft undertone. "I believe I had a small amount of luck." He used his rag once more on his brow. He didn't like to brag no matter how true the matter at hand. He mostly associated his vein finding to an incredible amount of luck.
Kali caught up to him and gave him a choked greeting, Garik couldn't help but give her a brotherly, if not awkward pat on the back. Seeing her obvious inner turmoil he felt it best that silent accompaniment would be the best course of action.
He watched with great interest as Alishai gave Thandrim the care a mother might her eldest child. It brought back memories of a time he wished he could forget, when his parents were together and full of life. His heart ached and yet he could not take his eye from them.
Walking full force into the on coming crowd quickly reminded him where he was. A few muttered apologize's and a moment of embarrassed awkwardness found him standing at the lifts waiting for the others.
----------------------------------------------------
Thandrim
"W-well hey now I--" Thandrim is just in the beginnings of protesting the action of Alishai cleaning his face up. Yet it dies fast leaving behind a slightly awkward face that is getting cleaner by the second. Perhaps a tidbit in the passing scuttlebutt convinced him that having a properly clean face in the near future would be good? Perhaps, but whatever, his face is clean now. A true rarity in the crowd certainly.
"thanks." The youth mutters the word more than says it to Alishai. A short swallow and rake through his dusty hair follows as he find fresh reason to keep quiet while the lifts are vacated of the new shift opening space for the outgoing crews to pack in tight for the ride out. A process that has never been greatly comfortable despite the best efforts of the engineers.
--------------------------------------------------
chibiamy
Violet eyes narrowed and slid over to Thandrim at his antics, then rolled as Alishai started wiping off his face. Boys! Really! Thought Kali, even though she watched the pair longer than she intended. Finally she pulled her attention back to Garic, and easily took the pat on the back, leaning to the side to nudge the man with her own shoulder. "Good find there, Garic. That should help with the blasted Bloats," was offered before something seemed to quirk the young woman's attention.
Ooooh! The Hutt ship had arrived! And it was a fine looking ship? Kali sighed, almost wistfully as the group merged in with the growing crowds. Not that Kali LIKED the Hutts, she despised them, but a good looking ship was ... well a good looking ship. Plus it was always a wistful dream to leave the Last Hope, to go into the wide wide galaxy. It HAD to be better than this. Not to mention, there were things she wanted to do.
Kali shook her head suddenly, shivering as the memories of a certain dream ran through her mind. Absently Kali starts to put her arms around herself as if cold before managing to stop herself. One hand raises to scrub at her short spikey tails on the top of her head before she gives up and keeps walking.
--------------------------------------------------------
simplyscribed
'Don't mention it.' Alishai replied good-naturedly, turning her attention back to walking. She listened to the chatter around her but found little worth noting; one visit from the Hutts was just like any other, no matter how pretty their transportation.
Kali's behaviour didn't escape her notice, and Alishai frowned slightly. I'll have to have a talk with that girl. She decided after some deliberation, but said nothing for the time being. She did increase her pace to move alongside the younger woman, sharing only the gift of companionable silence.

As your groups conversations continue you start to merge with the rest of the bottle necked miners awaiting the lift run up. Races and even sex become indistinguishable to each other, all are tiered and dirty. Standing bored each of you are left to your own thoughts, piercing your focus Alishai`s and Anazider`s comm links burst to life.
The voice of Lieutenant Aries Soome replaces the static of the comm " Sorry to cut into your off time, we just got a request for aid. Some miners are reporting a disturbance and have asked for aid, or thats what it sounded like before the comm cut off. Could be nothing maybe a bad comm unit, but I want your crew to check it out anyway. The workers where scheduled to section C sub level ten, be careful down there not all of the pitfalls have been marked off in that new area."
On hearing this some but not all of the miners give way to your party allow more room to the lifts
-----------------------------------------------
Rowen
Garik watches Alishai as she makes her way confidently to the lifts. He often wondered what went threw her mind in times such as these but knew enough not to envy her.
He gave her a tired nod as she approached, "Our day is never truly over, is it?" then looked up to see if the others where close behind. "I truly hope everyone is okay," This last part he spoke aloud but to no one in particular.
---------------------------------------------------
simplyscribed
Alishai shakes her head, passing Garik and stepping into the lift. She turns to look out of the door, hand coming to rest on the control panel, and for a moment a conflicted expression marrs her features.
I'll give them ten seconds, she decides, before I press this button.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Anazider
Anazider frowned slightly at his commlink, shaking his head slowly as he made his way to the lift. He moved to the back of the lift car and leaned against one of the walls, waiting for Alishai to press the button.
"Likely another scuffle of some sort. The Hutt's visits always seem to... overstimulate most, causing outbreaks here and there."
He smirked at the humans, shaking his head further to himself as if he were sharing some inside joke. When his glance came to rest on Alishai, Anazider quirked an eyebrow at her posture and the brief moment of conflict that played across her features. The falleen prince stored that bit of information away for future dissection as he turned his attention to Garic.
"No rest for the weary, as they say. I'm sure we'll settle this quickly enough. Who knows, it might actually be something interesting, like Mynocks or giant ore slugs."
----------------------------------------------
Rowen
Seeing the odd expression on Alishai's face Garik decides he best follow. He steps onto the lift and heads toward the back standing beside Anazider. Leaning against the wall and crossing his arms he listens to Anazider.
"Mynocks would be easy.....but, giant ore slugs?" He makes a snorting sound. "well lets just say you have a......unique definition of what fun is." He smoothed over the remark with a soft smile and a nod indicating he really did think it might be fun.
---------------------------------------------------
chibiamy
Kali would pout, but she's trying to grow up ... and she's too tired, honestly. A deep, resigned sigh shakes itself loose from the young woman as she reaches up and hurriedly runs her hands over her tails, flicking some more dirt out of them.
Then she glances at Alishai, then Anidazer, and then to Garic, pointedly ignoring Thandrim for the time being, before wrinkling her nose. "Is it just me, or do miners get themselves into trouble alot?" is asked in an attempt at humor before she stretches and pulls out her spanner once in the lift down. "I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm ready to get this overwith in a hurry."
--------------------------------------------
Thandrim
Well so much for that newly clean face. But if fellow miners need their help, he is certainly not going to deny it. Extruding himself from the crowd, Thandrim edges his way to join the others of his small crew. "I am quite sure the others still stuck in there are more than ready for us to get to them in a hurry. Likely did not quite take stock of the gravity and ended up trapping themselves behind a boulder." The most likely answer usually being the correct one, Thandrim considers a tumble with rocks the odds-on favorite. Perhaps one of the other planetoids in the asteroid belt has drifted close enough to shift gravity some. Just enough to cause rocks held steady in one direction to collapse now. No matter, dig them out, listen to their thanks and be back in the habitat perhaps in time to catch Lacy's latest trade visit still.

The long lift ride down has always been rather dull, the unremarkable rough hewn worked tunnel seams to go on forever. Kali makes a comment under her breath "They should at least put in lift music." Finally the lift stops creaking in protest the lift light turns from red to green indicating that it is safe to disembark the lift.
Section C is relatively new mostly un-worked, sub-level ten is the most recent extension on the mine. The dimly light mine shafts are eerily quiet lacking the traffic of the upper levels. The ground is rough and uneven, some tools lay scattered about randomly. The lift stops at a T intersection, to the right another lift this one for ore loads and unloads auto ore carts. You come in backs to the west, to the north east and south the tunnels extend further then you glow rods allow for.
Garic has been down here before, being part of the team that discovered the vein of ore "It has been awhile since I was down here, they have added more tunnels since then." A slow but steady stream of ore carts pas in from the eastern and southern tunnels loading and unloading into the ore lift to your right. The northern tunnel show not activity at all.
((A perception check reveals only the slight noise of falling gravel from the north tunnel, the south and east tunnel you hear a low moan of mining equipment))
-------------------------------------------------------
simplyscribed
Alishai stepped out of the lift and looked between the tunnels. Logically, they should go South or East, but there was something to the sound of shifting gravel she could hear from the North tunnel that she found unusual.
'I suggest we attempt contact via comms.' She says after a moment's thought. 'If that fails, we should split into two parties, one led by Anazider and the other by myself. We can cover more ground and keep in contact.'
She reached up to the commlink hooked over her ear, hoping the miners here had the most basic good sense to have switched to the open line.
'This is Alishai Venn of the security detail. Please advise as to your location.'
None of the confliction she had expressed in the lift was visible now, a witness would note. In fact she seemed the very avatar of calm, from the cast of her features to the manner of her stance.
-----------------------------------------------------
Anazider
Anazider looks to the haphazardly scattered tools, a small frown of distaste creeping across his lips. He knew exactly how much each piece of equipment cost, so seeing them treated with such disregard bothered him on some level he hadn't quite identified.
Something about the sound of falling gravel from the north bugged the nobleman. It was a sound familiar and easily discarded by anyone who had worked any length of time within a mine, but the fact that the shaft was seemingly unmanned, while the sound persisted, made Anazider's hand stray to his almost-forgotten sporting blaster.
"Well, lets be about this. I still have more reports to file."
The prince looked to Alishai's comm, then his own, awaiting a response.
---------------------------------------------
master_Tru
Alishai and Anazider patiently await a response from the hail, any response. Disapointed the only response is static, everyone shares worried glances to each other. The com comes to life again but in disappointment it is only Lieutenant Aries Soome "We have checked the schedule, there should be two colonists down there Melli Dizz and Vyn Orn. We will monitor your progress Soome out."
Melli Dizz is a Gungan, only about Kali`s age, in a different place they might have been good friends. Vyn Orn is the senior surveyor in charge of mineral exploration, Garic knows this man well, he helped teach Garic much of what he knows. Vyn was also in charge of the mission that discovered this vein of ore. Patiently waiting any further signs Alishai keeps her comm open a little while longer, but gets no further response
-------------------------------------------------
Rowen
"This is very wrong," Garik adds as the silence is almost as suffocating as the rebreathers they wear during mining.
"I hear mining, the call said a disturbance." He pointedly reminds. "If something were going on would YOU be mining." He turned and looked to each member, the question directed to them all.
Garik then turns to look down the tunnel where the shifting of gravel is plainly heard and searches for any tale-tale signs to lead the group in the correct direction.
"Please let Vyn be okay." You hear him whisper under his breath.
((OOC: Perception check to see if I notice more out of place and perhaps make a sounder judgement.))
------------------------------------------
Thandrim
Thandrim frowns at the lack of communication with the missing two. That is certainly a facial expression he rarely issues. Stepping out of the lift and looking around some while the others attempt to establish contact he spends the moment to consider.
"Would you take the time to shut the machines down if you'd been caught in a cave-in?" The youth says quietly while eyeing the southeast passage. Next to get his attention is the celing. "I hope the area is stable enough for us to dig them out, and that they found a solid section to hole up in until we do."
----------------------------------
Anazider
"We do not know if there was a cave-in, Thandrim. Likewise, the disturbance may not have been cause enough to stop some of the miners from working. Time is money, after all."
Anazider speaks with the shrewd calm of a business man. His words are more matter-of-fact rather than sharp as he looks down each shaft of the T-intersection.
"Let us find answers, not assumptions yes? Garic, you're with me; Kalaria and Thandrim with Alishai. If either group finds anything, signal through the comm and we'll all regroup and handle it together. We'll try the south and east tunnels first, and if nothing much is to be found there, we can regroup and head down the northern one. Agreed?"
The prince quirked his eyebrow at the others, speaking like one who is not used to being opposed. He gazed at each of the humans in turn, settling on Alishai for a tick longer than the others before he turns his attention to the southern tunnel. While Anazider liked Thandrim and Kali well enough, the thought of playing nursemaid to their adolescence chafed at his pride just a bit.
---------------------------------------------------
simplyscribed
Alishai nods her acceptance of Anazider's plan.
'Exactly what I had in mind.' She adds, glancing over at Thandrim and Kali. 'I would not entrust these two to any one but myself.'
Her lips twitch upward in a smile that may seem somewhat self-deprecating to the more observant, and her gaze travels back to the Falleen.
'We will take the East passage. Be careful, you two. And may the Force be with you.'
Turning away and walking towards the East passage, she glances back only once - to make sure her young charges are following.
----------------------------------------------------

Garik turns and heads for the South passage, stopping short to see Alishai gathering her troop together. "Be safe as well." He managed.
Then with a strained smile he motions for Anazider. "I'm anxious to find my old acquaintance, I've known Vyn for some time and he was not a careless man." with saying that he turns and with a purpose you've never seen in him before, swiftly heads for the South passage.
-----------------------------------------
Thandrim
With his glow rod aimed high more often than low, Thandrim continues to examine the celing for evidence that it might be unstable. As such the youth is beginning to edge a little closer to the northern passage when he replies, "Well a cave-in is the most likely ans--" The quiet reply, laced with an unavoidable touch of teenaged defensiveness is broken off by something else which causes the young human's left eye to raise a little.
"Entrust?" Thandrim does follow after Alishai however, leaving the northern tunnel alone. A new amusement plays in his eyes now along with a quirk to his smile. Just how he is able to avoid actually voicing a 'mom' joke is a mystery.

"The equipment was left idling, I bet. If something happened, would YOU have stopped to grab an ore cart?" rebuts Kalaria, not taking the time to glare at Thandrim for making a similar remark, but, also, not in typical adolecent fashion.
There are rare times when Kalaria actually sobers. Apparently, this is one such moment. An eyebrow raises as the young woman looks around, before looking back over at Alishai and Thandrim. Crossing her arms over her chest, she nods, first and foremost, before looking back at Anazider and Garic. Kali adds her own, "Be careful, you two," before she moves to follow Alishai, picking up another rock.
And this time, it's not to hit Thandrim with.
-----------------------------------------------
Anazider
Anazider watches Alishai depart, with Kali and Thandrim in tow before turning for the southern passage, motioning for Garic to follow along. He kept a hand on his sporting blaster as he listened intently to the rise and fall of the mining equipment, attempting to detect if anything was amiss. He hadn't used the hunting pistol in years, but had kept it polished and in working order even still.
"I wouldn't range too far ahead if I were you, mister Orn. The others would have my head if you lost yours, yes?"
The prince offered the other man a grin laced with dark humor, as he continued to stalk his way down the corridor.

The tunnels are fairly wide roughly ranging from 8-12m wide and at least 6m high. As you continue a slow but steady stream of ore cars traverses in both directions.
((this is where the similarities end, shortly after taking separate routes Alishai, Thandrim and Chibiamy comm becomes nothing but noise about the same time you each read the spoilers))
SPOILER for Garic and Anazider
[hide]You have walked about 200 m through mostly straight passage, up ahead a roughly 4 m section of the wall has collapsed. The section is spread across the tunnel, though it posses no threat to the stability of the tunnel nor does it hamper movement. Beyond this area the hum of a mining drill becomes louder.[/hide]
SPOILER for Alishai, Thandrim and Chibiamy
[hide]You continue down the passage about 100m before the tunnel turn due north. After another 50m the hum of the drilling equipment becomes deafening. The passage opens into an cavern about 20 wide by 40m long with two smaller tunnels at the end of the cavern one at the north side the other at the south side. At the end of the cavern a large mining drill mindlessly works its last programed task chewing away at the rock face, to your left about 10m away a Gamorean stands watching an obese Gamorean beat on a lone human sized figure who is in a fertile position on the ground. The thugs do not appear to have noticed your entry, and with all the sound you don`t they heard you.[/hide]
((I don`t mind if you read both spoilers as gamers I trust that you will play in character.))
-------------------------------------------
Thandrim
[hide]A long walk, and having gone relatively quietly with exception of the mining equipment ahead getting louder Thandrim grows a little more concerned as they move. No signs of a cave-in at all so far. Entering into the cavern area just a footstep ahead of Alishai and Kalaria his eyes are first drawn to the machinery, interupted in it's guided work and now purposelessly chewing rock.
It is the scene of abuse however that gets his attention most pointedly however. And for the moment, all the youth can do is stare at the scene, stunned and lacking any explaination or logic for what is happening, or why, or what a pair of Gamoreans are doing here at all.[/hide]
--------------------------------------------------------
simplyscribed
[hide]Alishai, it seems, has more presence of mind. Immediately she draws the blaster pistol at her waist - set by default to stun - and fires on the Gamorrean currently engaging in beating someone she can only assume to be one of the miners. Even if not, this fracas has to be broken up.
At the same time, she hails Anazider over comms to inform him of the situation.
'Gamorrean thugs, Anazider!'[/hide]
--------------------------------------
chibiamy
[hide]While Kalaria does not stop and gawk, she does not draw a blaster, either. Mind you, it could be because the young woman doesn't have it WITH her. Yes, she has one. But there's Garic and Thandrim and Anazider and Alashai around all the time. Why would she ever need one? Either that, or she woke up late after staying up far too long trying to find a way to hack into Darth Krayt's credit account....
The reason she doesn't have her blaster is unimportant. Once Alishai fires, Kali is rushing forward. The young woman leaps, completely intent on attatching herself to the back of one of the Gamoreans and beating it with her favored spanner, eyes wild and a sneer upon her lips as a deep growl rumbles from somewhere in her throat.[/hide]
----------------------------------------------------
Thandrim
[hide]Thandrim is lightly brushed by the charging form of Kalaria and left standing next to Ali while the woman draws her weapon. He's not sure if Anazider could hear her call through the comlink anyway, what with the machinery going full bore.
And then a realization strikes him. With widened eyes he turns back toward the confrontation and calls out, "Oh wait, Kali!!" He goes rushing after the young woman who is about to get herself beaten if she's not careful! With no hope of stopping her, he leans down as he runs and flicks his hand forward sending a small rock at the abusing Gamorrean. He picked it up..... right? Sure, sure he did....
((Use the Force, Move Light Object as an Aid Other Attack to Kali's current target.))[/hide]
------------------------------------------------------
Anazider
[hide]Anazider frowns darkly as he runs his gaze over the debris. Something catches his eye and causes him to rush over to the pile of rubble. The Prince comes up with a shoe; this spurs him to begin attempting to sift through the blockage for any sign of survivors or a trail to follow as to the cause.
Taking a moment to thumb his commlink on, he continued sifting with one hand while he spoke. "Anazider to Alishai, come in. Looks like the boy was right; there was a cave-in and we've found signs of possible casualties. You might want to come take a look at this…"[/hide]
——————————————–
Rowen
[hide]Garik watches Anazider rush forward and wonders whats gotten into the man. Then his eyes fall on the shoe in his hand.
Without a second thought he rushes forward and starts slinging rocks and large debris. The sounds of rubble skittering across the rock strewn floor echo's loudly around them.
His heart pounds sending the blood rushing his ears in a rhythmic, thrum, thrum, thrum. The sound was deafening and Garik was only partially aware that Anazider was attempting to comm the other group.[/hide]

Spoiler Garic and Anazider
[hide]With all haste Garic and Anazider dig out the rubble and stone using nothing but bare hands. Anazider`s frantic call to Alishai reveals nothing but inaudible noise. Shortly into the dig the limp body of a Gungan girl is uncovered. Melli Dizz lays half buried in rubble all of her limbs and neck rest at odd angles.[/hide]
Spoiler Alishai, Thandrim and Kali
[hide]-Thandrim tries in vein to yell out to Kali only to have his voice drowned out by the nearby drill. He reaches out as he calls to Kali, from out of no where a rock flys over hitting the first Gamorrean in the head forcing it to look up to the ceiling.
-Alishai squeezes of a shot that takes the obese Gamorrean in the back forcing him to howl out in vein, he is barely heard above the drill.
-Kali makes a bold dash towards the first Gamorrean, your all sure if you could hear hear she would be shouting some form of a battle cry. With some agility that's takes the Gamorrean and everyone by surprise Kali manages to jump onto the back of the first Gamorrean.
((End of the surprise round INT count as follows:

[hide]Here is where Kalaria should be her most fierce! She has managed to leap upon the Gamorean, and she raises the spanner over her head ready to strike at the warthog-face creature. But then, she suddenly stops. Violet eyes grow wide and the young woman pales, confusion and perhaps a little fear are reflected in her gaze which then turns glassy, staring beyond the thug beating on the human. She could be easily shaken off now, Kali seems to be somewhere else, mentally, than in the dangerous moment. Then she begins to shudder, shivvering, struck by some sort of internal cold.[/hide]

### **Thandrim** (2007-09-25 19:06:25)

[hide]Robbed of the ability to talk, yell, or even howl in ways that would be heard, Thandrim is left with eyes going wide as Kalaria clambers on top of the tougher looking Gamorrean. Swallowing hard once, he paces to move in a little closer, wary of getting too near the trouble given the fact that Alishai is shooting! All that fat must be providing some good protection to her target. But that is not his most immediate concern. Kali is about to get herself killed unless she backs off some. And so futilely without really thinking about it he calls out to her again. "KALI! Get away from him!" Waving one hand to get her attention and using the other to point back to Alishai.

*Of course he did.* She chastises herself. *Trust the evidence put in front of you.*
And now... this feeling...
She shakes off the worry, determined to resolve the feeling later - the immediate danger to her friends is more pressing.
'Surrender!' She calls without much hope for the command's success, taking aim at the same Gamorrean she previously hit.[/hide]

[hide]Anazider's eyes narrow to crystal blue slits as a feeling of unease sweeps over him. He analyzes Melli's broken body with a cold, reptilian detachment, although he does spare a moment to futilely check the Gungan's vital signs before pulling a scrap of her clothing over her face to cover her unseeing eyes.
Drawing his blaster fully, Anazider proceeded past the rock slide with the same calculating calm that had overtaken him upon seeing Melli's corpse. The foreboding feeling he got from the corridor ahead, combined with the unresponsiveness in his commlink made the nobleman step with a cautious urgency.[/hide]

[hide]Garik takes in a sharp breath when they uncover Melli's body. His mind whirls and his stomach lurches as though he is going be violently ill.
He still had presence enough to know something wasn't right. "I've got a very uneasy filling about his." He manage to blurt. His voice rang louder than expected and he winced as it reverberated in the tunnel.
Garik stepped over to Anazider and pointed back to the body. "Her utility belt is empty, as was her data pad holder. In fact did you see any gear on her body at all?" He looked Anazider. "Something tells me she did die under that rubble."
He looks down the corridor and adds. "I've got a feeling were headed for trouble."[/hide]

Spoiler Alishai, Thandrim and Kali
[hide]-Thandrim`s pleas go unheard through the noise of the near by drill, and though his frantic gestures are seen both Kali and Alishai are too occupied to do anything about it.
-The obese Gamorrean turns staring straight at Alishai, his hands drip blood and his one tusk moth obviously spouting challenges. Behind him the barely recognizable Vyn Orn lays bruised, bleeding and unable to stand. The obese Gamorrean his head down rushes directly for Alishai, an axe in an overhead two handed grip vibrates menacingly.
The obese Gamorrean`s swings wide, Alishai easily side steps, but the blow digs deep into the rock floor scattering debris across a 2 m square.
-In reply to the miss Alishai squeezes off another shot. This one barely grazing its shoulder.
-Kali seams to loose all focus, she hangs to the first Gamorrean`s back. While it begins to twist violently easily throwing the girl 2m towards Thadrim, Kali manages to land on her feet.
-The first Gamorrean pulls out a vibro axe of his own staring intently at kali, while the obese Gamorrean changes to a one handed grip and takes a step towards Alishai axe held high.[/hide]

[hide]Alishai moves swiftly away from the Gamorrean - though further into the cavern, so that she is further from her attacker and closer to her friends. While she fires at him again, her other hand unhooks the stun baton from her belt.
The brutal nature of the Gamorrean's attack was unnerving, but Alishai is no stranger to the realities of combat and moves with a ready grace and deadly purpose.

### **Thandrim** (2007-09-26 17:56:34)

[hide]Thandrim would breath a sigh of relief at seeing Alishai draw her stun baton to hopefully stop the rather resilient fat Gamorrean, rather than just shooting him to death. He would, but avoiding a flying Kalaria takes first priority. Following that comes the attempt to see if she is alright, which is made quick and easy by her landing with surprising dexterity. Lastly however, is the problem of the other Gamorrean looking rather upset and drawing a force axe which is showing all the signs of soon to be used upon a foolish seventeen year old girl.
Thandrim's mind races to find a solution, and in the rashness that so often accompanies youth he finds an answer. Not perhaps the wisest, safest, or best answer, but he does not have time to really think things over now does he? Extending one hand before him, Thandrim steps in front of Kalaria and shakes his head 'no' at the first Gamorrean...

[hide]Without weapon, Kalaria is useless, despite landing on her feet out of sheer intuition. The woman's eyes seem haunted, and that shivering still faintly runs through her as she looks around. "It's wrong. Something is wrong. Something is very wrong!" she continues to repeat to herself, seeming to miss Thandrim stepping in front of her for her own protection.

*Of all the times to become chatty, Garic, you've chosen a poor one. Who knew all it took was a dead Gungan?* Anazider thought to himself, as he shook his head wryly, finding a hollow amusement in the dark thought. He found himself missing the familiar low hum of the mining equipment, each reverberation of the new noise threatening to drive a spike of doubt through his implacable calm. The nobleman held fast to his stoic nature, hoping that the static coming from his commlink was merely a coincidence.[/hide]

He quietly unsnapped his blaster from the holster around his hip and held it at the ready. The new sound grated on his nerves and he was more interested in finding *it*, what ever *it* was.

The light from the glow rod plays shadows across the rough walls, about 20m down the tunnel an opening forms some 10m wide by 15m long (running south). Inside the small cavern the far end sits a large drilling machine (8m by 4m with a revolving drill 8m by 2m), a large Gamorrean stands smashing the drill over and over again.
The Gamorrean has already smashed the controls to the drill (most likely what stopped it), but for some reason has continued to beat on the drill with a large nasty looking vibro axe. When you enter the cavern his back is turned to you, he seems oblivious to your entrance. As he continues to hammer away at the drill he shouts out what could only be Gamorrean curses. "Clank ..... Clank ...... Clank."

[hide]-Thandrim moves in front of Kali, for reasons beyond anyoneelses understanding holds his hands out in front of himself towards the first Gamorrean.
-The obese Gamorrean swings over Ahishai`s head, Ahishai you are sure he took a few strands of hair on that swing. His breath is fowl as he snorts down on Ahishai.
-Ahishai steps back cautiously towards Thandrim and Kali, squeezing off another shot she aims high hitting the ceiling.
-The first Gamorrean moves axe overhead ready to swing at poor little Kali, shocking all but mostly the Gamorrean he quickly rises into the air hovering midair 1m from the ground flailing his arms wildly. Thandrim hands are held out towards the Gamorreans sweat forming on Thandrims brow. ((this move Thandrim to 11 in the INT count))
-Kali runs around the Gamorrean keeping a wide angle, stops at the Drills control panel. With a few quick key strikes turns the large drill off. The grunts of the Two Gamorreans echo off the tunnel walls.[/hide]

[hide]Thandrim's eyes widen a touch as the more fit Gamorrean lifts off the ground. Surprised that it happened? Sadly for him however, there is little doubt as to the true cause of the brute's newfound powers of levitation. With one arm outstretched (yes that's one, not two :P) directly toward the green skinned pig-like alien and beads of sweat forming upon Thandrim's brow, what question can there be?
As the engines of the mining equipment shut down, things get a lot quieter. If you considered the grunts and squeals of two angry aliens to be quiet. Still, one is immobilized and Alishai appears to have a chance to pacify the other shortly, if she would just hit it.
Yet for all that, the youth's brow furrows even through the effort he is putting forth. A little color can be seen to drain from his face before he speaks quietly. "I should not have done this. I have called attention to us." And at that, the Gamorrean moves again, back away from Thandrim, Kalaria, Alishai and the beaten form of Vyn. The movement ends with the alien back upon the ground, and softly placed no less! "Back down." The words are spoken with considerably more strength than either his frame or his previous comments have hinted at.

"I doubt you understand me much, but *this* should be very clear." Anazider motions with the blaster, emphasizing his point.
"I remember hearing that Blotus required his men explore and approve of any expansions to the mine, but never a reason as to why." The prince said more for Garic's benefit, never taking his attention from the Gammorrean.
"What I don't remember is hearing about Blotus's men destroying equipment and crushing poor Gungan women. So, either you are acting on your own, or with express orders. And you don't strike me as the sort to have enough intellect to act independently. Lead me to your boss, now!"
Anazider put an edge of command into his voice, implying that he would brook no nonsense in this matter. He motions with his blaster for the Gamorrean to turn around and move as commanded.

He couldn't get the image of the Gungan woman out of his head. His eyes narrowed and his blood burned in his veins. He wanted to kill this creature, it didn't deserve to live.

She doesn't use her stun baton to attack - it has primarily been used to help fend of the Gamorrean's vibro-axe, since she is more proficient in the use of the blaster pistol. It is this latter weapon then that she lines up with the Gamorrean's face as she continues to back off, calling upon the Force itself to help guide her shot.

"You're… you're one of THEM," she hisses under her breath. That's when Kalaria bolts, fleeing away from Thandrim the fear palpitable off of her. If he's a Sith like Krayt... she's not ready yet. She can't ... not yet.
Still, Alishai is there. And Alishai needs help. Swallowing her fear, Kalaria rushes over to the mining equiptment, fiddling with the controls and even kicking it a few times before she is able to turn it off. Trembling the young woman looks over at Thandrim, then at Alishai, before looking at the poor miner huddled on the ground. "Why is this happening? Why is this happening right now?" she gasps out, still shivering before she dashes towards the man. "Come on. We've got to go. Something's wrong, so very wrong right now. We've got to get out of here," she entreats towards the other two humans.

Still partly off balance from the unreasoning attack, the young human thrusts one hand forward revealing something that has not been seen by anyone else's eyes for seven years. The concealed holster up Thandrim's sleeve sends a Lightsaber into the teen's left hand, ignited instantly to display a bold blue. Curled dark hair whips about as the young human makes use of his position and spins to strike at the Gamorrean with a pained "Urrgh!"

Then the Gamorean is rushing towards her, even as she stands her ground, trying to protect the brutilized miner at her feat. But then... but then...
Thandrim pulls out a weapon. A blaster would have been great but, it... it's glowing! It's a lightsaber! He IS a SITH, isn't he?!

"Gamorreans make for poor assassins, wouldn't you say?" The attempt at a joke doesn't soften the steel in Anazider's eyes as he follows the Gamorrean, his finger resting delicately on the trigger of his blaster.[/hide]

[hide]'A Jedi...'
The wonder in Alishai's voice is cut short as she dodges back away from the Gamorrean's axe, questing again for purchase in her flesh. As she sidesteps, she catches sight of Kali standing in the other thug's path, rooted by fear.
'Snap out of it, Kali!' She shouts, but then her attention is once again arrested by her own predicament.
Gamorreans are notoriously hardy, as Alishai is finding out trying to stun the brute with no effect. Her instincts tell her to switch her pistol to lethal, but she suppresses them.
*It may be useful to have one alive, and the other won't be now it faces a lightsaber.*
If she cannot stun her opponent this time, she will be forced to kill him - and she would much rather have this work; accordingly she stops dead still for a second, firing calmly, doing nothing to distract her from her shot. Afterwards, whatever the result, she withdraws once more in Kali's direction, bound to help the girl if she can.
((OOC: This time, making the attack action first and the withdraw action second - though if the Gamorrean is stunned she'll take a full move action instead if she needs to cover more distance than the withdraw would take her))[/hide]

Spoiler Alishai, Thandrim and Kali
[hide]-The Obese Gamorrean rages out another mighty swing with its vibro axe, this time hitting with a reverse swing into Alishai`s back. ((18 damage, -1 down the condition track)) It replies into its comm "Grhg", to which the Rodian replies "Bizzipoz zipz."
-Alishai takes another cautious move several steps back, snapping off another shot her aim is wide just missing the Gamorrean`s ear.
-Thandrim ignites the brilliant blue light saber, and with a skilled downward swing strikes the Gamorrean at the shoulder the lightsaber exiting the opposite shoulder. For a brief moment the Gamorrean stares at Thandrim anger then surprise crossing its dull eyes before its upper torso sides off the lower torso already cauterized.((nat 20 rolled <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> ))

Spoiler to Anazider and Garic
[hide]-Garic pulls the trigger of his blaster, the smoke from the barrel mimics the smoking hole left by the shot in the Gamorrean`s head. Its crashes to the ground in a thump.

-Over the comm a Gamorrean can be heard "Grhg." Followed by the same angry Rodian "Bizzipoz zipz."[/hide]

[hide]Alishai cries out in pain as the vibro-axe runs across her back, cutting through the cloth of her shirt and furrowing into her flesh. Her steps back become more of a stagger, and the pain makes it too hard to aim - her hand shakes as she pulls the trigger, the blaster bolt going wide of the mark. It is all she can do to stay on her feet.
Gritting her teeth and fighting tears from her eyes, she lashes out with the stun baton in a wild feint, designed to distract the Gamorrean's attention from the pistol - hopefully a fatal mistake.
((OOC: Deception check vs. Gamorrean's Initiative check to feint, followed by an attack next turn depending on the results and the other character's actions.

"…We will talk about this later, and in great detail. But I would suggest you allow me to handle the *aggressive* negotiations from here on, yes?"
Anazider moves over to the still-warm Gamorrean corpse, rifling through its meager belongings with a frown of distaste. The creature's recent death did nothing for its unwashed smell.
"Seems we will have company soon. See if you can get into contact with Alishai again now that the comm is open; the mention of two witnesses leads me to believe there are other goons somewhere in the mine, and I want her to be forewarned."
After completing his search of the Gamorrean body, he rises to his feet and continues further into the mine.[/hide]

"I'll… I'll get Orn!" she stammers out, trying to shake the feeling of dread filling her, before moving to dash away from the Gamorean, and staying away from Thandrim, as best she can. Her intent is clear. She is rushing to Vyn Orn, the brutally beaten miner to aid him as best she can.
((OOC: Basically, full move trying to reach Orn and see if he's alive. Well, alive or not, Kali is going to hover protectively over him, and try to drag him to safety.

[hide]With his free hand now inadvertently clutching up the intact front of his shirt and holding it against the wide thin cut across the chest, Thandrim appears to have entered a wholly new mindset. Perhaps it was being struck, perhaps it was the killing, perhaps it is still pure instinct that guides his actions instead of rational thought.
Whatever the true motive, it appears the young human is no longer willing to let Alishai suffer at the hands of the fat Gamorrean anymore. Regardless of how nice it might be to have the creature alive for questioning later, an ally and friend's life is well and truly in danger now. As a result, Thandrim moves forward with hissed breaths still clutching his chest, around to flank the remaining threat, and moving into range, thrusts his blue sword of energy at the Gamorrean. There are no words of comfort or optimism now, nor are there calls of anger or rage. There is just a young human, his lightsaber, and a threat that *must* be removed.

He turns defensively to Anazider. "Yes we will." He starts to holster his blaster when he hears the second comm message. At almost the same instant he swears he can hear Kali pleading for help, he can hear the fear in her, almost feel it as if it were something palpable.
He yells into the mic. "Kali, Thandrim, Alishai! You have one inbound. Were on our way." He looks to Anazider. "There in trouble, we have to get there NOW!"

[hide]The foul smelling Gamorrean is still alive, but hurt and still dangerous. Mustering what he can of himself, Thandrim continues to adopt a more defensive style of battle. It is made somewhat easier by the fact that his training with the lightsaber focused upon single hand use. Which simply means he can continue to hold the cloth of is shirt against the still bleeding chest wound suffered seconds before. Unwilling to risk further danger from the Gamorrean, the young Jedi strikes again with a low sweep of blue energy that might well take off a leg or two if it hits home.

Then anger flares. Vyn Orn was a nice guy, a little on the old side, but he'd always been nice. How DARE they beat him, kill him this way. He deserved respect. Frantically Kali searches the man's body, whispering her apologies, hoping that he might have a blaster on him. One she could use to avenge Vyn Orn's death.

The young would-be Jedi's followup sweep of the legs reveals yet again the surprisingly agile nature of something that should not move so well. But for now, there is nothing for it.

Almost in slow motion, Kalaria turns around, levelling the blaster towards the Gamorean dancing between Thandrim and Alishai. Her eyes narrow and focus, her lips turned down in a deep frown that furrows her cheeks and a low snarl escapes the young woman. "Now, just die," she hisses before letting off a shot with the blaster which is most certainly NOT set to stun.

Sparks fly briefly as Thandrim pulls his light saber to meet the axe, straining against the Gamorreans obvious strength the two lock for a brief moment. Durning the lock the large Gamorrean smiles at Thandrim his breath most foul forcing Thanrdim to cringe further.
-Alishai taking advantage of the two combatants engaged lock swings high at the Thug, striking him across the head. Dazed the Gamorrean continues to advance on Thandrim, the young jedi begins to doubt his position.
-Kali closes her eyes as she quickly squeezes off a shot at the Gamorrean hitting it square in the back. For a moment it stands anger in its eyes at Thandrim. Then with a thump falls to the floor creating a small dust cloud.

The noble blue glow of Thandrim's lightsaber disappears the very instant the fat Gamorrean falls. Quick to ensure his composure, he spends a quick second to look the foul smelling alien over, noting the deepening cut into that vibro-axe. Seems the Gam was going to press the attack even if he lost half his cutting edge on that weapon.
The weapon of the Jedi is slipped back up Thandrim's sleeve, followed by a more distractionatory sweep of one hand through his hair. "I have a bad feeling about this." A really bad one, in fact. Noting that the individual they were to find has been found, and is sadly now dead, the teenaged human steps away from the Gamorrean corpses and closes his eyes. There he remains for a minute, just breathing in spite of everything around him including the pain at his chest.

She then hurries over Kali and Vyn Orn.
'Kali, are you okay?' She asks, voice full of concern for the younger woman. As she speaks her attention is on the injured miner, assessing his condition.
'Sithspit, do either of you have a medpac? I can't do anything for him without one.'

Kalaria's eyes are wide, her hand still trembling as she holds the blaster so very still, long after she fired off a shot that struck the fallen Gamorean in the back. Her expression is one of struggle, her eyes upon the Gamorean on the ground, and her body constantly shifting from trying to rise and staying where it is. "They killed him," whispers the younger of the two women. "They just beat him to death. They killed him because they could. Why… why would they do that? He… he was a nice man. He said something about a ship and darkness. Then he said we need to destroy it or they will something. But… I don't understand. Why would they kill him?"
Kali finally lowers the blaster, still staring at the Gamorean near Thandrim. "I wanted him to die," is breathed before she continues. Her eyes turning to look at Alishai as she is suddenly rocked by shivers, seemingly changing the subject. "I'm so cold."

With eyes still closed and breathing seemingly uninterupted, Thandrim replies. "He is beyond aid, but it merely means his suffering is over." The voice is certainly recognizable as Thandrim, and yet very much unlike what he has chosen to display before.
Dark eyes shift to look upon Kalaria, his face tilting slightly. "Murder does that to people. Killing for revenge.." His eyes shift to the prone form of Orn. "Or for pleasure. It is dark work."

'It's okay.' She says quietly. 'He is one with the Force now.'

Kali continues to tremble in Alishai's embrace, not fighting it. "I'm so very cold," she says again, still trembling, almost violently now.
Suddenly the young woman cries out wordlessly, grabbing Alishai and clinging to her, sobbing. "Tell me everything is going to be all right. Tell me I'm going to be fine. I don't want to become like my nightmares. Make it warm again! I want it to be warm! Tell me I'm safe… please!"

Despite her worry for Kali, Alishai almost smiles. Finding words to comfort the girl reminds her sharply of her own faith and comforts her in turn. She holds Kali tightly as she speaks, stroking the girl's hair, eyes roving to Thandrim.
*Everything is changed. I never knew them at all.*
'Everything will be all right.' She says loudly enough for Thandrim to hear. 'Everything *is* all right. The dead have moved on to the embrace of the Force; they will feel no more pain, no more concern. And for the living life goes on. The loss is acute, but with acceptance comes comfort. With comfort comes a return to balance, and with a return to balance comes an affirmation of the self and ones place in the Galaxy.'

Thandrim rolls his neck atop the shoulders once, then spends a moment eyeing the corpse of the Gamorrean he killed, sliced in half to be accurate. It was an unfortunate thing, but he'd warned the brute. He tried.
"Killing is not easy, and never should be." His eyes look to Alishai and Kali, his own seeking Ali's now as if to emphasize his next response. "No. No it is not alright." Apparently not quite buying Ali's argument that it is. And yet in that moment a change once more overcomes the young teenaged human. His face loses some of the stress of the fight, and while one arm still holds itself over his still painful wound the youth takes on a more pleasant visage. He.... somehow he IS the old Thandrim again. "But it *will* be. Our troubles over this event have only begun but I am certain we can solve the matter of why they were here. And why Vyn is dead. We must link up with Anazider. And I need a bandage, my shirt is getting quite soaked."
Good Lord, it IS the old Thandrim. And just like that?

Alishai's left brow quirks, and she shakes her head.
'Typical Jedi.' She comments. 'Never any ground for compromise. Yes the act of killing is a hard one, but to punish oneself after the event accomplishes nothing but to compound guilt and pain and push one further towards the Dark Side. Deliberation over whether to act is right or not should precede the event not follow it; once it is done it is done and no amount of wishing will change it.'
She stands, drawing Kali to her feet too provided the girl doesn't resist.
'You're right about our next course of action. Kali, we'll talk more later but for now you have to pull yourself together and be strong. Others may be at risk, we don't know the extent of this. Thandrim, take the Gamorrean's commlink. One of the others might understand Rodese.'

Durring the 'debate' between the two, Kali manages to stifle her sobs and wipe away her tears, but there is still fear in her and her eyes tell that story easily. The young woman continues her shivering for the moment, allowing ALishai to pull her to her feet.
Then she backs away from the woman, holding up a hand to Alishai, so the woman keeps her distance. Then she looks to Thandrim, and makes the same motion to the man. "Stay away," she manages to get out, backing into the cavern wall. "Just… just what are you, BOTH of you?"
A deep breath is taken and slowly the trembling slows to something nearly imperceptable. "What … what are you talking about?" comes the next question as Kali's eyes warily look over Thandrim, then over Alishai. Kalaria stands there for a moment, braced against the cavern wall, before she shakes her head. "Whatever you are talking about, I don't want to know about. But Thandrim, you should grab that … *thing's* comm since you are right there. And we need bandages for both of you. I'll… I'll go see if … if Anazider and Garic are coming. I … I need out of this room, **now**," lets out the young woman before she grabs a glow rod and is rapidly, almost blindly, rushing for the exit that will lead to the lifts OUT of this mine!

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-03 11:52:30)

Just what are you?
Thandrim's answer to that question comes in a typically Thandrim, and perhaps completely inappropriate way. "Realists." Spoken with a touch of humor in the eyes and upon the lips as he seeks to retrieve the comlink. His humor is broken a little as he bends however, that wound is not going to let him do much without reminding him of it's existance. He'd warned the Gamorrean, he warned him.
Turning his attention at last to the would-be fleeing Kalaria, Thandrim makes no efforts physically to stop her. "Please don't go without escort, Kalaria. Please. We don't know who else may be down here but…" Looking at the Gam's comlink again, an idea strikes him and his eyes slip to Ali. "Perhaps we can get a signal through on your com now?" After all, the aliens didn't seem to have a problem there. Perhaps it was a blanket jam that is now gone? Perhaps.

Eyes narrow at Thandri as Kali turns around, looking at him. "Realists, huh? Why don't I buy that?" she asks before shaking her head. Still slowly edging towards the exit to the cavern, Kalari frowns then waves her hand at Thandrim. "Why don't you just try now? Since the drill is off and we can hear ourselves think, you might hear the replies on the other end of the comlink now." is stated with more typical Kali gruff, before her scared eyes look back to the dark exit again.
To see Anazide and Garic! Blinking, Kali's fearful and worried face almost brightens as she rushes toward the two men. Immediately she tries to cling to Garic, before suddenly backing and looking away. "Sorry, I just… was going to look for you. They… killed Vyn Orn. We weren't in time. It… " Kali stops herself and frowns at the ground even more. "Alishai and Thandrim were both hurt. Do either of you have bandages? We need to go. I need to go. Please?"

"Kalaria, tell them what you said that Vyn Orn told you, before he died." Then looking down a little at himself and the injured Alishai he comments a touch further. "We'll be alright, but I think I could use a new shirt."

"Just… just what are you, BOTH of you?" 
Alishai recoils from Kalaria as though slapped and allows the girl to move away.
*Yes. What am I?*
The question comes from deep within, rooted in the secret thoughts she has kept hidden from everyone and, she realises now, even from herself. The realisation of her self-deception cuts deeper than any vibro-axe wound and she shudders, eyes closing.
She opens them again when Garic and Anazider arrive, but makes no move and says nothing. Her expression has become haunted, desperate even, but as Kali summarises the recent events it hardens to a look of grim resolve.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2007-10-03 16:47:24)

Anazider quirks an eyebrow at the trio of bodies on the cavern floor before turning that same look on Kalaria, Alishai, and Thandrim in kind. He cants his head at an angle, like a bird regarding a particularly peculiar bit of bread. The prince had much practice at judging mood and character, but it didn't take an empath to feel the palpable waves of tension rolling off of the small group.
"…Well, I didn't think the Gamorreans smelled THAT terribly. Regardless, it would seem our unknown assailant is under the impression we have a Jedi with us, and I'm in no mood to correct him as to otherwise.
I suggest we all beat a hasty retreat back to Lieutenant Soome and advise him of the situation, and let him handle the rest. Garic, cover our rear and I'll take up the lead. If our Rodian friend drops in for more pleasantries, lets cover the young ones until they can reach the lifts and go for help. Any questions?"
Anazider looks impassively from Kalaria's tear-stained face, to Thandrim's usually-cheerful countenance, before settling on Alishai with her look of grim determination. He reminds himself to ferret out just what occured between the three later, before making his way back towards the lifts.

No amount of treatment could bring back Vyn Orn, it was just too little too late. As your group decides what to do next Alishai`s and Anaziders comm`s spark to life. "This is Lt. Aries Soome please report in, we have reports of Blotus`s men taking control of the lifts. Some of his men on on route to your position now, what has been happening down there?" The Gamorrean still unconsious stirs a little, loud snores begin from its nostrils its no wonder it doesn`t wake itself up. With everyone together now your group can breath more confidently knowing that whatever you face you do so together.

Kalaria blinks then looks sheepishly at Anazider, after looking over her shoulder, and raising a hand. "Yeah, about that, sorry. I WARNED the Gam to look out for my invisible lightsaber…" she starts before being cut off by the comlink.
Kali takes a step towards the exit to the lifts then stops, eyes widening, and she turns around. "Oh… this is bad. This is very bad," whispers the young woman as she points to the west tunnel and to the tunnel that would lead to the lifts. "Even -I- can hear people that way and that way. And Blotus IS behind this. I hate Hutts" grumbles the young woman shivering faintly and throwing her arms around her before looking for that blaster she 'borrowed' off of Orn.
"I TOLD you we needed to go. NOW will you listen to me?! As for what Orn said, something about don't let ship old … then darkness. Then we need to destroy it or they will something. I didn't really have time to ask him any questions. Now let's <strong>GO!</strong>"

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-03 17:32:41)

Still holding bloodied shirt partly to his chest wound, Thandrim quirks an eyebrow at Anazider. "A Jedi? Well that might explain things some. Big bounty on the Jedi these days." Nodding once to himself more than anyone else, Thandrim takes a couple of steps closer to the newly arrived pair. Yet he keeps a little more distance between himself and Garic than Anazider. Or is that just because Kalaria is clinging to Garic? With the coms crackling to life, Thandrim is given to frown just a little on that usually cheery face.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-03 17:38:31)

As Kali talks, Alishai is busy readying her weapons. Apparently she too hears the footsteps. She also speaks into her commlink: 'Lieutenant Soome, this is Alishai. Gamorrean thugs killed the miners here. We are surrounded by assumed hostiles. Any assistance you can drum up... well, it will probably be too late but it'd be appreciated anyway.'
'Where *to*?' She asks Kali when her message is sent, in a tone of voice that suggests complete calm; icily, eerily so. 'The other tunnel is probably a dead end... We can risk it if you prefer taking a chance.'
'Whatever happens... Thandrim, Kali, if you see an opening you run to the lifts.' The woman looks sternly at the girl, then at the young jedi. Her gaze seems to linger on him longest.
'No arguments. The Galaxy has a better use for you than to have you die here.'

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Rowen** (2007-10-03 20:19:32)

Garic heaves a sigh of relief to know his friends were okay. He also hears the footsteps down the southern tunnel, and the western tunnel. He frowns and glances at Thandrim's standoffish posture, and made a mental note to speak to him at a more appropriate time.
Drawing his blaster up to a relaxed but ready position he moves away from the entrances. "It would be a wise choice to stay where we can move and fight." He looks to Alishai and Anazider. "If I clear a path, get those two out of hear." He thumbs toward Kali and Thandrim.
He seems to struggle with some deep emotion and you notice his eyes cut to the fallen body of his friend then close as if in silent morning.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-03 20:34:53)

"We are ALL getting out of here," blurts out Kali as she glances around the cavern. Then without a word, she rushes over to the drill and starts working on it and points towards the Northwest tunnel. "Rodian," she tries to whisper before turning her attention back to the drill, trying to get it to start again and programming it where to go.
Once assured that the drill is starting up and going to where she wants it, Kali lets her eyes fall over everyone else, biting at her lower lip as she looks at Vyn Orn's body. A deep breath, and the young woman rushes for the blaster pistol she dropped hurriedly before running towards the northeastern tunnel.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-03 22:16:27)

So much for communication when that drill gets going again. Thandrim looks to have been just ready to retort at Alishai for her 'orders' to escape when Kalaria takes the initiative once more. With a small sigh, he looks after her and comments, "Always on the move."

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-04 20:09:55)

Kali enters in a series of commands into the small data pad the drill slowly churns to life. It begins to slowly move towards the Northwest passage, as the drill rotates the noise level increases. Alishai`s and Anaziders comm`s open its LT Soome voice again "Surrounded what .... " the transmission is cut off by the sound of the drill. The drill starts to chew into the northwest passage grinding stone and dirt, it also blocks your view of that area. Shadows wielding axes play across the floor towards the southern end on the cavern, who ever you heard coming in for the south tunnel will be here soon.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Rowen** (2007-10-04 20:50:09)

Garic watches the drill move into position and silently thanks Kali for her ingenuity. He then tightens his grip on the blaster and faces the southern passage, ready to blast what ever decides to come threw that passage.
((OOC: Aiming at the first creature that comes threw that passage, only firing if fired upon.))

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-05 14:31:33)

Alishai turns with Garic to face the south tunnel as Kali - ingenious little wrench monkey that she is - turns a tool into a weapon and effectively blocks off the other entrance.
But then she notices Kali running towards the Eastern tunnel. Turning rapidly,she sets off at a run after the girl, intent on assuring she comes to no harm.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-05 14:39:12)

'Let there be a way out in this direction,' Kali offers up in a silent prayer to whatever higher forces are out there. But then she pales and stops THINKING about forces or THE FORCE. With blaster in hand, Kali is running, running and only occasionally looking over her shoulder.
The fact that Thandrim and Alishai are the only one's following causes her to frown and she comes to a skidding stop. Raising her hand, she shakes her head and motions back down the tunnel towards the others. Then she points to herself, to her eyes, then back down the tunnel she was running through. Then she tries to shoo Alishai and Thandrim both back waving her blaster as part of the conversation, before turning around and running off again.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2007-10-08 16:28:41)

Anazider exhales slowly in exasperation as the younger members of the group go running about.
"Yes, or we could run around like a pack of stimmed-out nerfs. That's a viable solution too." He hisses sarcastically while shaking his head. The prince watches as Kalaria goes through the process of reprogramming the drilling equipment, his eyes opening slightly in surprise when it actually works and heads for one of the tunnels.
"Smart…" Anazider comments quietly to himself. He folds his arms across his chest, his blaster still held in hand. Then, suddenly, Kalaria goes speeding down the opposite tunnel, toward the sound of even more menacing footsteps.
"…Not so smart."
Anazider sighs again before taking off after the rest, blaster held high and at the ready. He hoped that his brief association with this rag-tag band wouldn't spell his certain doom.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-08 16:56:07)

With the usual noise from the mining equipment, Thandrim is left with being able to give just a 'look' at Kalaria. Not that she is paying a great deal of attention to *him* anyway just now. For similar reasons he is not in a position to outright pull her back and try their luck with the lifts, that is appearing to be less and less an option.
As such, Thandrim is following while the passage narrows. His musings on just why anyone would suspect Jedi living locally going unheard by anyone, though his thoughtful look does not hide his thinking.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-08 17:08:27)

With a few key strokes Kali engages the drill, it slowly begins to churn as it advances towards to northwest passage.The noise from the drill begins to build it will take some time before it reaches decibel level that cut off your comms and voices. Not sure of what will happen Garic stands ready blaster held high at the south entrance. Anazider stands not quite sure what to make of Kali`s disregard for his orders. Not use to others taking the initiative Anazider plots the next best move for the group.
The drill starts to chew into the northwest tunnel, the sound of rock and dirt becoming deafen. Anazider`s and Alishais comm go off with LT. Soomes voice again "Surrounded what hold on I have to report this to the Captain" his voice is cut when the comm link ends.
Kali heads for the northeast tunnel, while Alishia begins to follow only to stop short when Kali waves her away. Two Gamorreans wielding vibro axes enter through the south tunnel, they see the two fallen Gamorreans one begins to charge. Garic at the ready fires off a shot at the brute hitting him square in the chest. Smoke rises from the patch work armor and Garic takes a step back as the pain of the shot does little to slow the beast.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Rowen** (2007-10-08 20:36:24)

Garic's eyes widen a bit as his blaster bolt hits home but does little to slow the charging beast. He back peddles, careful not to trip but needing to put a little distance between him and the steroid induced pig charging him. He sights in again, ready to blast the foul smelling beast.

Alishai turns, slender fingers already moving to reset her blaster pistol from "stun" to "lethal" as her body whips around to the side so she can keep some of her attention on the impetuous girl in front of her as well as the Gamorreans and her friends behind.
She fires a shot at the second Gamorrean, trusting - *hoping* for Garic to be handling his own target.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-08 20:43:46)

With the two Gamorreans coming from the open corridor, Thandrim's attention swings to where the drill is delaying the 'other' party coming for them. Frowning and going more than a little white, he looks more frantically to that southern passage. "We need to stop these guys fast, we *cannot* stay here!" Clearly more shaken than he's shown before, the youth grabs a hefty rock at his feet and hurls it at the unwounded Gamorrean with all his strength.
((Standard ranged attack action with improvised weapon))

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-08 21:09:27)

The fact that both Thandrim and Alishai turn around and stop following her makes Kalaria pleased. The fact that Alishai fires off her blaster, and Thandrim picks up a ROCK, does not make Kalaria pleased.
Looking at her own blaster, then looking back at the group, Kali sighs and tosses the blaster at Thandrim's back. If the young man is going to play that game, she might as well make him USEFUL. And yes, she even rolls her eyes.
Flicking back around, Kalarai inhales deeply, slowly, and now without weapon, starts walking carefully down the tunnel where there does not appear to be any Gamoreans or Rodians coming to assult the group. With her glow rod in hand, and a lick of her lips, Kali does a little scouting to make sure the group isn't going to be flanked. She can run fast if she needs to, after all! Fast right back to Garic, Anazider, Alishai and that blasted Jedi.

-Kali throws a sleek black sporting pistol Thandrims way and disappears into the tunnel.
-Thandrim with a smile pelts the charging Gamorrean with a thrown stone scoring a hit the brute barley notices.
-The first Gamorrean charges up to Garic planting its axe into the ground about a good half meter in front of Garics feet. The second Gamorrean advances with more caution, axe in front of itself to deflect anything incoming.
-Garic backs up from the enraged Gamorrean still not sure how to take the beast down, he fires off another shot. The Gamorrean takes another step forward then falls flat on its face with another smoldering carbon wound.
-Alishai flicks her blaster off stun and fire at the cautious Gamorrean it slumps to the ground in a heap.
-Anazider upon seeing the situation has been taken care of for now, vigilantly eyes the south entrance for any more would be assailants.

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-09 17:22:09)

Thandrim looks at the blaster pistol as though it were a poisonous snake that just poked out from a rock. Nonetheless as both Gamorreans fall he does bend down to pick the weapon up, holding it as though it *is* a dangerous snake. Then with a swallow he heads for the passage Kalaria disappeared behind, eager enough to withdraw from the area.

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-09 17:30:48)

Unable to hear over the noise of the drill, Kali does not know that the battle is an an end. So she turns her attention back to the passage, lifting her glow rod, only to shortly lift her eyebrow as well. For a moment, the young woman pauses, tilting her head to the side as she peers down the darkened passage. But then her feet begin moving again, slowly at first as she carefully begins to walk, but shortly quickening their speed as something seems to spark the young slicer's curiosity and draws her closer.

Alishai sighs and shakes her head. She feels regret over the life she has taken, yes, but nothing in the way of guilt. She has no doubt in her mind that a peaceable solution would have been no more likely here than with the previous two. A small, analytical part of her mind tells her that her first opponent would have gone down that quickly if she'd switched from stun earlier. *Yes*, she acknowledges. *I'm still glad I didn't*.
She glances over at Garic and Anazider.
'We'd better follow them. They need looking after, particularly if that tunnel's the dead end I suspect it to be. At least it's a small one, we may find a point where we can force pursuers through in single file.'

Anazider lowers his blaster as the pair of Gamorreans are soundly dealt with. He follows after the pair of teenagers, the slightest hitch to his stride betraying his annoyance.
"What they need are restraining collars. I've half a mind to shoot them both and save the slimy skinned miscreants the trouble." Frustration overshadows the nobleman's dark humor, although he keeps a steady watch for further signs of trouble. Once outside of the interference provided by the reactivated drill, Anazider tries his commlink once again.
"Anazider to Lieutenant Soome, come in. We've still an unknown number of hostiles advancing upon our situation, but we're in the clear for the moment. Still requesting reinforcements."

Garic's heart still beats fast from the encounter and he's mind whirls with the realization of what *could* have happened if the axe had found its mark. With shaking hands he lowers his blaster and peers toward the souther tunnel.
Satisfied no one else is moving in at the moment he checks the fallen beasts then quickly follows the others. Agreeing whole heartedly with Anazider's vocal rant.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-10 17:11:01)

Kali walks down the passage, at her feet a large square metal panel. Well worn the panel is about 1 meter square with fadded lines, orange now at one point the lines where red. There is no sign of what the panel belonged to though it is obviously not part of any equipment piece within the coloney. Further down the passage scattered shards of metal is scattered about the tunnel floor. Alishia`s and Anaziders voices both go unheard as the drill continues to grind away at at the northwest tunnel.
Thandrim, Alishai, Anazider followed shortly by Garic catch up to Kali. She is holding a large metal panel in her hands, further down the tunnel are scattered shards of metal reflecting light off the glow rods. They tunnel continues beyound the range of your glow rods, and the reflection off the shards follows the tunnel.
Anaziders comm opens "This is Marthg at control your Lt Soome will talk to you shorty, in the mean time the gracious Blotus the Hutt will accept your surrender now." In the back ground allot of inhuman laughter can be heard. The voice over the comm is not one you recognize nor is the name Marthg.

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-10 17:18:58)

Kalaria holds the panel and looks it over, before taking another step down the passageway, still holding the piece. She kneels and looks at another small pieces momentarily, before rising and moving to another, inspecting the pieces that might actually BE reckognizable as she can.
Oh? Others have arrived? Kalaria doesn't notice. There is a half-smile on her lips, a dreamy expression, something one might see of someone not completely awake.
Or someone completely lost to curiousity.
And Kalaria continues, ignorent to the others, whether intentional or not remains to be seen, making her way down the passage, dragging the first piece with her.

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-10 17:34:16)

Thandrim presses his way past the distracted Kalaria murmuring in an almost teasing way, "You're wasting tiiime." Seems that HE at least has no desire to lose any ground in getting away from their pursuers, metal fragments not withstanding. Further down the tunnel he goes.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-10 17:38:20)

'Yes, Kalaria.' Alishai says as they catch up with the girl. If anything about what she says catches the girl's attention, it might be the use of her full name - Alishai only ever uses that when things are serious. Usually by way of reprimand. 'We don't have time for whatever you're doing. We either need to hurry on, or head back to the lifts. Either way we need to move!'

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2007-10-10 20:33:45)

Anazider affixes an annoyed glare on Kalaria then turns it on Thandrim as he taps the muzzle of his blaster on his thigh. His normally dusky-olive complection has gained a rosier tone, betraying his agitation despite his best efforts.
"Do not run off again, either of you. You may have decided to become Gamorrean chew toys, or Hutt slaves, but I would prefer it if you did it on your own time, where it would have the least possibility of killing or maiming the rest of us." 
Anazider says in a hiss, regaining his composure a moment later. He moves over to a pile of the shrapnel, kneeling down and nudging bits of the metal with a slender finger before peering ahead into the unrelenting darkness.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-10 20:44:52)

This is all to strange. Kalaria, as a resonably intelligent (almost) adult, can understand what people are saying, understand and 'read' their expressions. It's part of having grown up in a social culture wher eone deals with others constantly. It teaches one to understand these things.
Well, all except for Thandrim's. That one is the most frightening and surreal of them all.
Blinking, Kali drops the large piece she was hauling with her with a thunk that is more 'felt' than heard, her jaw growing slack and dropping open. Then she slowly slides away as the man passes, before blinking again. Snapping her mouth shut she frowns after Thandrim and grabs one of the small not harmfully pointy sharts of metal and raises it to throw it at the young man's back.
Then Alishai is before her, and her full first name slips from the woman's lips, causing Kali to blink, and pale. She starts to frown, and then draw into herself when Anazider walks up now, glaring at her. Defensively, Kali tries to glare back, but it lasts only a moment, and it looks like the young woman is going to pout.
Then she frowns, no, she snarls and glares at all three in anger as she shoots up to standing suddenly. Growling loudly, Kalaria turns and in frustration throws the piece of metal as far as she can into the darkness, making certain to avoid Thandrim, before crossing her arms over her chest and waiting for Garic to move before her, like a shield between herself and the other three.

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-10 20:54:16)

Despite barely hearing Anazider's rather annoyed rant, Thandrim does not appear to be very willing to stop. Slow down some yes, but stop? No. Well maybe for a moment as he feels the impact of Kali's latest ranged assault.
Using a thumb to empasize the point by first pointing back the way they came and then onward into the dark and metal strewn tunnel he speaks loud enough to be heard now. "As it stands, we know bad people are back that way, and we don't know what is down this way but we also don't have any other options. Thandrim pauses there to actually take that smirk on again. "Besides, I think technically we ARE on our own time at this point yes? Unless you really think surrendering is a *good* idea."

Garic comes up last and glances at the panel's. He's face screws up in a moment of confusion. *What could THOSE be,* He wonders to himself.
His mind quickly reorients its self and he trains his blaster down the tunnel, guarding as everyone looks about. He notices out of the corner of his eye that they appear to be communicating. His peripheral vision isn't enough to catch Kali's obvious displeasure or the impatient postures of the rest of the group.
He keeps guard, ready to move at a moments notice.

'This is ridiculous.' Alishai asserts. 'It does not help our situation to argue in such a manner.'
'Nor, however, does it help our situation for any of us to act in a manner that isn't in the best interests of our survival. Kali, whatever you think you've found, it surely cannot be more important than your life. Thandrim, try to be serious for once and be a little more respectful. And Anazider, collect yourself. No harm has been done.'
She looks at Garic too, but has absolutely nothing to reprimand him for.
'From now on we are a team, understood? We plan together, and we act together. Let us move on to wherever this tunnel will lead us. Garic, I think it prudent for you to take point.'

"No harm?" Thandrim blinks once at Alishai looking to be taken aback by her words on that point alone. "We've killed what, four people now? No harm? I–" The youth sighs in a quick breath and shakes his head once sending hair tumbling. "No, I know what you mean. Let's just move on here hmm? Team or not, we've lost the ability to negotiate with these guys."

Further down the passage everyone travels, along the ground more and more shards of metal fragments continue to be discovered now in increasing numbers of a variety of sizes. The passage still roughly 4m wide by 3 to 4m high, about 10m down the passage a sheer flat surface can be seen closing the tunnel off. As you approach the end of the tunnel the sheer flat surface turns out to be a large metal wall which continues into the stone walls (up down and both sides). The metal has the same worn orange lines running though out its surface, 0.5m of the ground is a damaged airlock hatch. On seeing an airlock hatch you realize this is a ship and a big one at that.
The design (from what you can see) is nothing you are familiar with. The hatch looks as if it had been blown open, no light comes from within. The little amount that could be writing on the hatch is not recognized by anyone in the group.

Turning his attention back down the tunnel, Thandrim presses on before anyone else yells, snarls, or throws things at him. However it is not long before he is brought to a halt again. Seeing the side of what has to be, could only possibly be a ship, he just stands there staring at it now similarly to how Kali reacted to the metal fragments. A ship? *Inside* the asteroid? Boggled with the very idea, the young human is paralyzed for now.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-11 18:06:36)

Kali's first reaction at seeing such a thing, would normally be to rush forward and inspecting every inch of it. Instead the young woman takes a step forward then draws herself up short. Casting her eyes around, Kali purses her lips and pulls her arms in tighter as they cross over her chest all ready, and she waits.
She's not rushing forward. She's not giggling with glee. She's not even making an annoyed or angry or snide comment. She is simply standing where she is, periodically trying to get behind Garic, and the back of the group. Maybe once or twice she looks over her shoulder to make certain nothing is sneaking up on them.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-11 18:43:52)

Alishai advances on the metal wall, amazed at finding what can only be a starship within the very rock of the asteroid.
She feels something akin to the curiosity that Kali must have felt when she discovered the metal plates, but with great strength of mind turns away.
'Well, this thing is no use to us unless there's a way to fly it out of the asteroid.' She comments, looking past the others down the tunnel with an expression that can only be described as "worried". Clearly, as interesting as this is, it still appears to her to be the dead end she feared.

Garic stops short at the site before him. "A ship? Here!" He says stating the obvious. Inching closer to the hatch he holds his glow rod aloft to project the most amount of light.
Excitement coupled with the sinking feeling of being trapped succumbs him. He resists the urge to bolt, even panic, which could so easily be done in times like this. Instead he moves close enough to the hatch to see more. His trusty blaster is held at the ready.
((OOC: Perception check to see if I notice anything inside the hatch.))

Anazider is in the middle of a snappy rebuttal to both Alishai and Thandrim when his commlink blares, and a chorus of inhuman laughter comes flooding out, followed by an ominous greeting. Anazider mutes the comm while looking to the others.
"Well, I hope it is still space worthy, whatever it is, otherwise it may very well be the site of our last stand." He punctuates the bit of dark humor with a smirk. Holding the sporting blaster in his left hand, he places his right hand on the hatch, attempting to push it open.
"Although if I were a betting man, I would say we may have found that which the late master Orrn spoke of."

Closer inspection of the hatch has it hanging in a hinge, it could be pushed open. Looking at the edges of the ship that you can see it continues through the rock, no clue as to how far though. The ship from what you can see looks old much older then even Hope`s End and she served during the rebellion over one hundred years ago. Dispute its unknown age the ship seems well preserved, from you vantage point. The light from Garics glow rod reveals a corridor inside, the corridor is 2m wide by 2m high and continues past the light of the glow rod. Unfortunatly from Garics angle that's all that can be seen, as you inspect the ship the dull roar of the drill can be heard. You are far enough away that it will not disrupt your communication, though if you go back into the cave again it has reached full power.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Rowen** (2007-10-13 17:45:48)

Garic pushes the door out of the way and slowly begins to venture forward. "Nothing ventured, nothing gained." He quips. A slight waver could be heard in his voice despite his calm exterior.
He again moves his blaster to a readied position. Not sure just what to expect beyond the hatch. One more glance back toward his friends and he turns back around. His full attention on what lies beyond.
((OOC: Garic is watching very closely for any sign of danger, I'll take a perception check Alex!))

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-13 19:43:51)

"Not like we have much choice." Thandrim's comment is rather absent of humor or even pleasantries in this moment. Rather his voice is a hushed and awed tone, still quite unable to wrap his head around this whole idea of a ship *inside* an asteroid. Even so, with the light blaster pistol still held in one hand as clearly an afterthought, he starts to follow Garic into the hulk following one slow steadying breath.

### **Anazider** (2007-10-14 14:37:21)

Anazider holds his glow rod in one hand and his blaster in the other as he enters the ship through the hatch. He holds the light out front to illuminate the area, casting eerie green shadows about the surrounding area.
"From the looks of things this relic's been lodged in the rock since before the Last Hope arrived. Most intriguing." 
The nobleman's earlier anger seems to have evaporated in an instant, replaced with his usual calculating calm. He continues further into the ship, looking for a control panel of some sort.

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-15 10:25:19)

"Let's just find what we need to destroy and get out of here," grumbles Kali, now finally pushing her way towards the front, regardless of protests. "And if you'd rather loop back up to get word to the Last Hope, do so. I think I can take care of myself in a dead ship. I promise not to fly off with it," drawls the young woman with a note of sarcasm to her voice.
Kali doesn't even stop near Garic, she just tries to push past the Zabrak as she holds her own glowrod up to start looking around for a dataport or an access panel of some sort. If she can get the main computer to come up that would make things much easier.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-15 17:14:56)

Garic and Thandrim, followed by Anazider enter the ship first. Quick to enter behind them Kali pushes past Garic, Alishai pauses outside to make sure they are not followed. The ship groans in protest sending slight shivers of vibration up your spines. The floor is stable, and the ship does not move at all you guess its only the age of the ship itself. The 2m by 2m slightly hex shaped corridor is lines at the top and bottom with non-functional light panels many of which are smashed. Dust and an assortment of debris lay about the corridor, this was an airlock as about 6m ahead of you is a open hatch. The light from your glow rods reveals a four way intersection ahead. The dust on the floor has been recently disturbed, though there is too much recent traffic to make out numbers. At the side of the portal you just entered is a smashed control panel for the hatch itself.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-15 18:04:08)

Kali steps forward and looks at the smashed panel. Cosidering, she shakes her head and moveson, it would take too long to repair it. Instead she looks left then right, then heads to the right. "Eventually, I'll find a non-smashed panel or the cockpit. Going to get into this system here," she tells the others over her shoulder, not waiting for anyone to tach up or follow. She is, apparently, intent on her plan.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Rowen** (2007-10-15 18:13:51)

Garic blinks as Kali pushes past him and stops, watching her. Then shaking his head he moves off after her and the 4 way intersection. "No need to go and get your self killed Kali. We will all find the cockpit.........***together***." He punctuates the last word. "From the layer of dust and well worn track threw it I would say we have a pretty good chance to run into someone or something." He casually points to the floor with his glow rod as if showing everyone what he meant.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-15 18:49:43)

'Perhaps,' Alishai lowers her voice, 'it would be sensible for us to stop speaking, then?'
She doesn't move to follow Kali, instead turning back to face the open hatchway. She shifts stance, adjusting her feet to more comfortably hold her weight, obviously intending to stay in place for a while and guard the rear.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2007-10-16 19:30:06)

Anazider keeps his glow rod held high, illuminating as much of the corridor ahead as possible. He looks to the tracks in the dust, eyeing whichever seems to have been the most recently disturbed, then following them.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-16 20:35:28)

Thandrim follows along behind Anazider and the others. Although Alishai has clearly chosen to hold the passage. At least it should give her cover. Watching all that is illuminated by the glowrods, he performs his own search for anything that might aid the small band in holding off their recent enemies or at least convincing them to play nice.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-17 06:27:08)

As your group enters the four way intersection, the corridor opens to a comfortable 4m wide by 2.5m high still hex shaped. To the left the corridor continues beyond the 12m range of your glow rods. Straight ahead about 10m is a door on the left side of the hall, the corridor also continues past the 12m of light provided by the glow rods. Heading right you progress 20m before coming to a T intersection. If you continue right the light shows only 12m of the corridor, the corridor continues past that. Straight ahead 5m down the hall are doors on both sides of the hall, plus a second door on the right hand side of the hall.
As you walk through the ship the same disturbed foot prints run throughout the ship, someone found this ship before you and has already explored it. The floor of the corridors are littered with debris, when you stop at the T intersection a grey droid arm is found an the floor. Examining the the droid arm show it is very old, there are no markings on it, even what little amount of circuitry within seems frail and worn.
Off in the distance a slight clanging sound can be heard, it echoes throughout the halls softly. Periodically the ship groans in protest, some of the metal plating on the corridor floor also groans against your weight. It is obvious this ship has seen no maintenance in a long time.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-17 14:29:58)

Kali pretends to not even have heard Garic. She simply heads off at the intersection, ignoring the Zabrak as he tries to speak. Alishai is ignored as well, yes, Kali's beeing a teenager and in a bad mood. Why, she even just glances over the debris, not pausing to pick up the droid arm, instead she keeps moving to the right, as if navigating a maze, always searching for a panel somewhere to interface with.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-17 17:18:17)

"No. More likely we are seeing evidence of Orn and the girl's exploration." Thandrim voices the statement quietly, as though unsure of how the ship itself might react to loud noises. For while it is a vessel, it nonetheless gives him the feeling of a tomb. Perhaps it is just the dust and their current situation.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Rowen** (2007-10-17 20:21:11)

Garic bends to examine the droid arm a little closer, hoping to glean any information he can from the few clues before him.
((OOC: Perception check on the droid arm and area around for clues, take 10 ))
After his inspection Garic pads softly after Kali, hoping the girl doesn't end up getting herself in more trouble than she can handle. Which he is starting to think might just very well happen if she doesn't gather her wits about her.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-19 05:41:41)

Garic you examine the droid arm, its old the circuitry seems shot. There are no tools attached to the arm, the arm appears basic in design your best guess is that it was part of a labour droid as it three fingers appear to lock. Any and all markings on the arm, if any have long since worn away. The only thing you know for sure is that the droid is not of any design you recognize.
Continuing right through the corridors your group proceeds another 20m. The corridor ends and straight ahead is a closed door, to the left of the door is a small panel. Rubbing off the dust from the panel reveals a few simple buttons and an interface jack. The door has writing on it though none of you understand the language.
(( I need a marching order))

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2007-10-20 17:00:45)

Anazider frowns in disappointment as he looks the door over, nothing recognizable coming to mind. He taps the muzzle of his sporting blaster against his bottom lip as he contemplates.
"Well, if either of you brought a datapad," Anazider quirks an eyebrow at the pair in front of him, "Then you could use the data cable on it to interface with the door. Slicing isn't quite my forte, I'm sorry to say."

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Rowen** (2007-10-20 18:43:48)

Garic discards the droid arm and turns to listen to Anazider. "Perhaps we could find out a little more about this ship." He adds after Anazider finishes.
He turns to Kali. "This might tell you where to find what your looking for." He smiles softly and motions toward the panel.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-22 10:10:08)

The young woman just grumps faintly, already pulling out her datapad which she NEVER leaves her 'closet' without. (Unlike her blaster pistol) Searching for a place to attach and interface with the door and the ship's computer, hopefully, Kali lets the others be paranoid for the moment. Her attention is on the technology!
((OOC: Okay, gonna try to slice into the computer, at least getting this door open. Using a Force Point as neccissary!))

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-22 10:40:13)

Watching the efforts to gain some sort of informational access to the ship's systems, Thandrim is nonetheless distracted. Looking back down the passageway in the direction of where Alishai should be. Still holding the airlock entrance. At least she has not called for support yet.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-22 16:27:40)

Back at the airlock, Alishai still holds her position, unmoved from the stance she settled in as her companions left to explore the ship. Her attention is primarily focused back along the tunnel from which they came, though she is alert for any danger coming at her from within the ship, taking regular looks around her and always paying attention to her peripheral vision.
While she watches her mind races, trying to find the sense in what has happened today.
*Are they after Thandrim, or me? I haven't done anything to give myself away… It's probably Thandrim. Unless they found my armour. My armour… I need to get to it. Sithspit, how am I to do that* and *get everyone out of this alive? And Thandrim, I have to keep him safe.*

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-22 17:15:13)

Standing at the door Kali wipes the dust free from the panel. Despite the age of the ship and ship systems interface technology has changed little over the years Kali`s data pad connects easily. The data pad scans the panel:
connecting ........
connecting ........
connecting ........
Insufficient power ......
scanning ........
scanning ........
Ships power levels 0%
panel non-functional ......
During the process the door panel does not light up no sounds of confirmation come from the dead panel. The door itself is a two sided sliding door with a slight gap between the two sides of the door. It looks like it could be forced open with a bar, or similar tool.
In the background the clanging continues, the ship groans again this time knowing dust from the ceiling causing it to rain down. All your comms beep simultaneously, someone using another channel is trying to communicate with you.
Alishai: the airlock is quite except the odd groaning of the ship and the clanging in the distance. No one follows your group through the tunnel.
((Kali no force point needs to be used ))

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-22 17:27:51)

Glancing at the small gap made, Kali looks around, then looks to Garic. Hmmm, the droid arm, perhaps?" she suggests, motioning to the gap as well. "There's no power to this panel, I think to get any information, we'll need to repair the power core and see what we can do there. Unless someone has a spare power cell floating around I could try to jurry-rig to the panel… and I'd rather do that in the cockpit than out here, like this, honestly," admits the young woman, looking back the way the group came. "Do we HAVE to leave Alishai behind like that? It doesn't seem…. I dunno."

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-22 18:03:55)

Alishai sets her comm to the new channel, receiving the transmission. She maintains silence, waiting for whoever is on the other end to identify themselves. They will know she's listening, after all.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-22 18:07:50)

"She is where she wishes to be." Thandrim's words are quietly given, his face somewhat far away for a moment before the youth shifts on his feet. "I think you will find that she knows better than to make a final stand there. If she spies trouble, we will know quickly." Even as he finishes, Thandrim begins to slowly step back down the passageway some, looking around curiously. It is not uncommon for the young human to switch from good humor to thoughtfullness at the drop of a hat and for seemingly no reason, but in the present situation it may well be more creepy than just odd.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2007-10-22 19:03:23)

Anazider nods his agreement with Thandrim, albeit slowly.
"I would say she is well grown enough to decide such. It is also a smart move; helps to ward against ambush, atleast from outside the ship. Unlike rushing head first into the darkness, that is." 
The falleen nobleman smirks to himself, motioning the others to complete silence as the notification comes over his commlink. When the other three are quiet, he clicks the comm on, listening intently.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Rowen** (2007-10-22 20:15:11)

Garic nods at Kali and grabs the droid arm once again. Heading to the door he judges how to best position the arm for the greatest amount of leverage, then holsters his blaster and gets to work.
He hears the comms go off and tries to make the least amount of noise while prying the door open. Hoping some good news might come of the transmission.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-22 20:33:28)

Alishai your comm opens, but all you hear on the other end is breathing, a little after you get no response you turn off your comm. Anazider you also get the same breathing in the back ground of the comm. Looking at the channel coming through its not one used by the colony, or by anyone else you know of.
Garic`s efforts to force open the door cause alot of noise, metal on metal. The doors seem to be seized shut but with a fair amount of pushing the doors open up almost one meter, more then enough room to squeeze in. The light from your glow rods reveal some of the room within. Its dark and much larger then the light reveals. Dust covers the floor undisturbed for unknown years, the dust has accumulated fairly high. Some six meters in front of you stands a large square block, shaded at first. When you move the light to see it better you realize it is a large computer terminal, at the edges of the room are more the whole room from what you can see is filled with very large computer terminals.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-22 21:19:06)

Disturbed by the breathing, Alishai quickly reactivates her comm, hailing Anazider on a private channel.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2007-10-22 21:23:48)

Anazider frowns at the ragged breathing emanating from his commlink, sighing himself in exasperation.
"If you're one of the goons working for Blotus, I'll have you know I find this in poor taste." He says before clicking the commlink off forcefully. He moves into the room with the computer terminals, distaste twisting his lips as he traces a line in the lairs of dust with a fingertip.
The prince switches his commlink to Alishai's signal when her hail comes in.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-22 21:29:15)

'Did you get that "message"?' Alishai asks. She doesn't describe the breathing, figuring that if Anazider received the same contact he'll know exactly what she means.
'If you didn't, sounds like we have *more* trouble.'

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2007-10-22 21:34:00)

"I most certainly did, and was quick in voicing my displeasure. We've found a decrepit droid arm and a room full of very large, very archaic computer systems. As you may be able to tell, the amount of fun we're having here is indescribable."
Anazider smirks at the comm unit, going back to the business of looking over the room full of terminals.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Rowen** (2007-10-22 22:10:44)

Garic winces as the metal on metal makes more noise than he had anticipated. With the door now open enough to squeeze threw he decides to do just that.
Holding his glow rod in his leading hand and his blaster in the second he moves threw the door to get a better look at what is beyond. He keeps a sharp eye out for anything unexpected and allows a smirk when he hears Anazider's reply to Alishai.
*Never a dull moment with this group*, he thinks.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-23 10:54:29)

At first, Kali seemed perfectly willing to let Garic enter the room himself. (See she CAN be cautious at times!) Then something sets the young woman to paling and she begins to shiver, wrapping her arms around her even as she still holds the datapad. "Tell her to get back here now. Tell her it's cold, Anazider. Please… Alishai shouldn't be alone right now. None of us should…" she states, swallowing deeply as she looks around. Fearful eyes flick over to Thandrim, and the young woman seems to shrink back in on herself, before hurriedly trying to squeeze in after Garic. "Garic, please, wait…" she murmurs as another shiver strikes her.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-23 12:14:15)

For his part, Thandrim is found to be closing his eyes even while Anazider becomes more annoyed. His quiet voice is heard again, eyes still closed and spoken just after Kalaria. "She is right. Alishai is vulnerable alone now, Anazider. Exposed." Still paying no attention to the fact that he could use his own comlink to relay that information himself. Finally the boy's eyes open and a step closer to the door opened by Garic is taken. "Most unfortunate." He actually looks regretful. Now there is an expression that never crosses Thandrim's face.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-23 17:08:46)

Now further into the room this is a computer room, though as Anazider had pointed out the computers are all archaic. The creepy breathing from the comm continues (to any who still have that channel open) but does not respond. Looking at the computers they are all intact but none have power. From just inside the doorway you can see the computers line the walls and another set of computers runs down the middle of the room. The ship groans again this time the ship shakes under your feet, causing more dust to settle to the floor.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-23 17:23:49)

Now this is more of Kali's element. And frankly, a nice distraction to certain creepy things. Ignoring the shuddering, the shaking and the groaning of the ship, Kali starts to move around the archaic computer room and open panels as she can, getting down on the floor in the dust to push her glowrod into one space, before pulling back and moving to a spot across the room. "No joking now. I need a power cell from someone. If you've got a spare one, great. Otherwise, I have to take apart a blaster. Not the best of options. And yes, this will drain the cell completely," comments the young woman as she runs a hand over her face and through her hair, pushing dark dust everywhere as she does so. "The sooner we figure out what this thing is, the sooner we can destroy what we need to, and the sooner we can leave here. And once THAT is done, the sooner Blottus gets the hell off our rock and leaves us alone," she snaps. Moody, fearful, angry, constant change -- something is definitely bothering Kalaria.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-23 17:33:36)

The ship's own upset snaps Thandrim out of his near meditative state. With a rolling of the shoulders and a deep breath the youth shakes his head and looks around with a dark frown even as Kaliara repeats her need for a power cell. As though still waking from a dream, the youth looks down to his hand to recall the small pistol carried there. Lips still working on a frown, the young human takes a different hold on the weapon, by the thin barrel, before slipping into the next room and offering it to Kali. "A poor option is still better than no option." Thandrim spends only a moment watching the girl, wondering.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2007-10-24 18:56:03)

Anazider sighs dramatically to himself as he speaks into his commlink, having never turned it off after speaking to Alishai.
"As you may be able to tell, your children need you. Would you like an escort to our position or can you make it well enough on your own?" 
He smirks to himself as he stands with one hand on his hips, his blaster still drawn. The inoperable nature of the computer terminals, as well as the metallic groaning and shifting of the old ship, doesn't seem to impress him much.

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-24 20:37:39)

Kali after a few moments is able to jurry rig the power cell from the blaster to one on the archaic computers. Then Kali interfaces her data pad to the computer, which only takes a second or two. With allot of crackling and popping the computer comes to life, the screen lights up briefly. Smoke rises from the large console and sparks fly across its surface. Before the computer finally dies a single word, in the unknown language comes across the screen. Kali in a rush quickly punches in a series of commands on the data pad, with some expert skills Kali manages to save some information to her data pad before it became irretrievable. The data pad could not identify the language but did narrow it down to a few possible translations of what the word was ( warning, caution, danger or mayday). Kali was also able to retrieve one other bit of information the last date the computer was active, which after the data pad calculates the time difference displays it in your current calender as 10,556 BBY.

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-24 20:38:26)

'Can they give a more concrete reason to want me there than a bad feeling and a concern for my exposure?' Alishai asks, not entirely unkindly, having heard at least some of the previous conversation over the open comms. 'Else I would really feel more useful remaining here and watching out for pursuers.'

---

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-25 10:54:15)

Kali's eyes flick over to Anazider as she is desperately trying to read through things no her datapad, a faint hint of annoyance. "Because this ship is nearly as old as she is," comes the murmured question not really meant to be heard from the young woman. Then she returns her attention to the datapad for a while, nevermind the smoke and sparks, and everything else.
Settling herself into the dust of the computer room, Kalaria tries to shut herself off from everyone else as she works, looking over what she was able to find, and trying to puzzle the word out. Any of the possibilities given could mean hundreds or even thousands of different things, so narrowing it down to one would would be ideal.
But never fret, the moment people move to leave the room, Kalaria is right behind, not straying too far from others, even if she is not interracting with them.
((OOC: Gonna still plug away at trying to figure out the meaning of the word. It's something to do, to focus away from creepy feelings and that breathing. ))

Garic relaxes a little and moves back out into the hall, keeping watch down either tunnel and waiting for the others to make up there minds and decide where to go next.
He is becoming slightly annoyed with the misdirection of peoples frustrations and just decides to just absorb himself with survival. Something he knows and that feels familiar to him.
"We have got to do *something*," He says under his breath.

## Re: Star Wars Legacy: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-25 12:41:01)

"Something yes." Thandrim is slow to leave the computer room, forcing his breathing to remain slow and steady. The overall effect being that he in total moves and speaks slower as well. "Though at present, we have few options other than to explore more of this…. ship. We are otherwise quite well trapped here. And Alishai should be with us for that rather than exposed and on her own." The last is spoken with a touch of annoyance. Her *children* indeed!

---

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-26 10:58:41)

Kalaria does note that people are leaving the room. So as Garic and Thandrim filter out, so does she, looking over her datapad and directing it's searches periodically. There is a moment were Kali stops in her tracks, peering at the screen momentarily with pursed lips. Her eyes flick upwards to look around, the glow of the datapad making her seem more pale than before, then she looks back at her information again, scurrying to catch up.

"Well, there you have it. You can decide if you'll leave your post, otherwise it seems we are continuing onto the cargo hold of the ship. I'll be sure to keep you abreast of our situation regardless. Anazider out." Closing the comm channel, Anazider looks to where the other three are heading and trails in their wake.
"Caution, as well as prudence, seem to be the order of the day here. I would not have us all meet our end for the sake of doing something, desperation not withstanding. We shall proceed wisely, and see what there is to be seen." The prince seems to have regained his full composure as he travels along with the rest, eyes searching the dusty gloom of the outdated spaceship as the group progresses towards the cargo hold.

Just as your group starts for a cargo hold you have no idea where to find a loud grinding sound can be heard it echos down the corridors, they the sound of a door slamming. Not sure what to make of this you are all glad that at least the ship did not shake that time. Then a voice not human but speaking a rough basic "Hello .... HELLO where are you my prey? I am coming for you .... I know who you are. Alishai Venn I will take you out first, Garic Orn you will die slowly as to watch your friends die too, Thandrim Cauthon oh you are so dead, Anazider you are not worth my blaster so I will torture you slowly. I save the best for last Kalaria Sein Gender the young one, you will watch your friends die I will take pleasure in killing them in front of you before I kill you too. HAHAHAhehe." His laughter echos off the corridors making it hard to pin down his direction.

Alishai rapidly reevaluates the situation. If there's a known enemy inside the ship, unknown enemies outside get shifted down the priority scale. As soon as the mysterious voice begins its tirade she sets off at a run down the corridor to find her friends.

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-28 12:48:16)

Lord and Master of the Obvious, Thandrim whispers a moment after the voice falls silent. "That… was *not* one of Blotus's men." The youth's neck moves slowly, as though unwilling to even give his position away with motion, though the effort is surely instinctive rather than thought out. He has heard the line before, 'oh you are so dead.' Yet it was usually coming from Kalaria's lips, and was never nearly quite as. . earnest as this time. Stifling the teenaged urge to bug Anazider about 'i told you so' aspects on why Alishai needed to leave her position and rejoin the others, Thandrim instead focuses himself on calm. "It seeks fear in us, to use fear as a weapon. To weaken, to panic, to enrage. There is nothing to fear." Sounds more like a mantra, but it may be as effective in helping the others as it is in helping the young human regain himself. Breathing steadies, eyes close a moment and open, shoulders roll. The enemy that relies upon fear is vulnerable. We must join with Alishai, then proceed to that cargo bay." Remarkably mature for a boy of seventeen. Especially under the circumstances.

### **Anazider** (2007-10-28 17:56:21)

"Spoken like a pirated Jedi holovid. But the boy does have a point; fear is a greater enemy here than whoever, or whatever, may be out there. Everyone stick together, we will regroup with Alishai and then move onto the cargo bay. No theatrics," He gives a meaningful glance to Kalaria, brooking no response, "And no heroics, and we'll see our way through this. Garic, keep a good watch on our flank. Thandrim, since you've made yourself weaponless, stand with Kalaria between me and Garic. Lets move!" 
Anazider takes up the point position, giving a fleeting, calculating glance at Thandrim's back as he goes past, before beginning a cautious advance away from the computer room. He switches his commlink to Alishai's channel, bringing it up to his lips while maintaining his vigil.
"Undoubtedly you heard that, Alishai. Are you inbound? We are moving away from our present location."

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-28 22:07:43)

'On my way.' Alishai replies, then cuts off contact so she can focus on her pace, her breathing, and the sounds of the ship around her. She will not falter, she will not grow weary, and she will *not* be caught out by the mysterious individual who watches them.
Nor will she buy into his mind games. She runs not from fear for herself or her friends, but from the duty she has to protect all their lives.

Kali doesn't say anything at first. Instead she just contiues to pale durring the disturbing speech, eyes flicking over every shadow, abviously rattled as she swallows deeply. As Thandrim speaks, Kalaria turns and looks at him, "Easy for you to say," she snaps, wrapping her arms around her again. "I **AM** afraid, all right? I'm scared beyond anything I have ever been before! And honestly, I'd think this piece of rock was spinning faster than it usually does if I didn't know that wasn't possible. Everything just seems all upside down right now! So you keep your bad Jedi Mantra's to yourself, and let me be fearful in silence, all right?"
Swallowing deeply, Kali winces once the words are out, instandly regretting them before shaking her head softly. "I'm sorry, Thandrim. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. I'm not really angry, I … I'm sorry," she whispers before hanging back a little to look at Garic over her shoulder. Then the young woman is deciding to busy herself with her datapad on a useless hunt of information. That, at least, is not so frightening as some disembodied voice that is probably millenia old and already knows her name. Yes, yes it is.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-29 16:18:28)

Taking up a position closer to Kaliara as Anazider wanted, Thandrim does not appear to be too reactive to the teenage girl's outburst, or her apology after. Rather, the youth who is clearly working internally to maintain calm offers the girl a small smile. "I know, you are afraid, not angry. But don't let either one hold you Kali. That's what he wants. Let's not give whatever it is anything." As they move inside the ship, the youth's eyes remain focused, scanning all about them and in particular from angles one might not normally expect trouble. Yet even as he walks, he speaks quietly still, even risking a touch on Kaliara's shoulder. "So long as you stay with us and focused on getting out alive, you will."
A final look featuring a kidlike smirk is shot back to Anazider, as is the snarky comment that Thandrim is quite unable to avoid. "Just something we learned in school. Any bully wants something from you, whether it's your lunch, or your fear to make him feel better about himself. Find out what he wants, and don't give it to him."

Alishai easily rounds the corner out of the airlock and into the corridor to her friends. Anazider, Thandrin Kali and Garic exit the computer room up ahead they hear Alishai running, they see the light from her glow rod. Everyone sees the thin red line of a blasters range finder, Alishai you see the line over your shoulder as you race to meet the others.Alishai is about 20m for the rest of the group and closing, the thin red line from the range finder is behind Alishai of in the darkness. Time all but stops as the scene plays out before you, following the red line a blaster shot screams past Alishais shoulder her training giving her the foresight to duck at the last second. A flash of light off in the distance briefly outlines a silhouette, the blaster shot misses but hits the ceiling sending sparks all around Alishai. To all your horror an second red range finder line begins to seek its target after the second. The same rough voice as before replaces the blaster shot " Its mine .... you can`t have it ..... I will kill you all."
(( Surprise round over, obviously you failed your perception checks sorry it happens. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> So to recap everyone is in the corridor the corridor is 4m wide by 2.5m high. 20m down the corridor the way you came in is Alishia running towards you, 10m ahead of you is another corridor and 10m behind you is the computer room door.

Eyes widen as the danger becomes very real for them all, but in particular to.. "Ali!" Thandrim was just speaking about not giving a bully what he wants, and he is quite ready to put the lesson into practice by not giving him an easy target. The hand still upon Kaliara's shoulder slips down to her arm, trying to take hold there and start running with her back to the computer room doors. At the back of Thandrim's mind echos the voice's words... you can't have it. . . it's mine. . .

'No!' Alishai deftly avoids the blaster shot, using the changed momentum to turn with remarkable speed and run towards her attacker. Upon reaching him she dives in a tackle, intent on taking him to the ground and with any luck knocking the weapon from his hands.
((OOC: Basically, Move action plus Charge action, counting the tackle as an unarmed attack.

For once, Kali doesn't yanks herself away from Thandrim. Instead the young woman seems almost comforted by the hand resting on her shoulder as she allows it to linger there.
Then everything changes.
A blaster bolt whizzes by Alishai and Kalaria's head snaps up. Paling, Kali's first instinct is to rush towards the other woman, to make certain she is still all in one piece. Then the realization of WHO that like is dawns on Kali and she pales even further, frozen in place momentarily. Momentarily because Thandrim is quickly pulling Kali back with him. She doesn't truely struggle physically with the action, reaching out a free hand towards the commotion, some part of her brain realizing that she is weaponless. "**ALISHAI!**" she screams as she is pulled backwards, desperate and fearful!
"Thandrim! We have to go back for her! Please… we … have to do … SOMETHING!" comes the young woman's desperate, pleading voice as she turns wide, fearful eyes on him. "I don't want to be useless! I don't want to loose everyone again! Please… we've got to help her!"

-Kali pulled back to the computer room shouts out to her friend.
-The unknown assailant fires wildly at Alishia, the first shoot hitting the wall beside her the second the floor 10m in front of her. This seams to anger the gunner, screams out in anger.
-Alishai runs at the foe full tilt when she reaches her foe she sees a shocked Rodian. The Rodian looks angry his facial features twisted, his eyes blood shoot. Nearly missing the Rodian Alishai manages to grab hold and during a brief struggle that takes a few moments, tackles him to the ground. As Alishai and the Rodian hit the floor the glow rod scatters across the floor, though still providing light. (( that used a force point simply, the force was with Alishai on that one)) Still struggling against Alishai the Rodian spits in her face while trying to push her off.
- Anazider not sure of what happened as only the light can be made out with two figures struggling, pulls out his blaster and advances on Alishais and the shooters position. ((move the pull out a weapon and a move 6m towards Alishai ))

Alishai glares down at the Rodian, ignoring the spittle but finding it harder to ignore the powerful sense she picks up from him. It's something she hasn't felt for seven years, and to her credit it doesn't frighten her. It makes her angry, though, but she struggles to control it... to control herself. If she fails that, if she fails to incapacitate him, he'll win. She draws her arm back and punches at the Rodian's face, buying herself an opening in which to remove her pistol from its holster.

There is a moment, a heartbeat, a breath of a hesitation of almost calm as Kali looks out the door of the computer room to the shadowed figures fighting downthe hallway. Then Kali's eyes widen and the young woman is stumbling backwards as if struck, her glow rod dropping to the floor. The light of the glow rod does not hide the continued paleing of Kalari'as skin, even light that poor cannot hide the ashen coloration that overtakes her.
And then a breath, a heartbeat later, it is all changing. Kalaria looks up, her face contorted in sudden and uncontrolled anger as her eyes catch the light just right to nearly glow their heated and dark feelings like darts back towards the Rodian fighting and struggling with Alshai. "Leave us alone," she whispers. "Leave us alone! I will tear you to pieces! Leave us alone!"
Kali's hands suddenly reach up to press and squeeze against her head as she actually whimpers, closing her eyes, squeezing them shut and stumbling backwards again, leaning against the pillar of hardware in the middle of the room. Struggling with something internally, the anger in her voice subsidesfrom uncontrolled, unbridled rage, to desperation and stubbornness. "Leave us alone… leave us alone … **LEAVE US ALONE!**"

Having just gotten Kalaria into the computer room, Thandrim stumbles to keep his own feet as the teenage girl nearly falls herself. He does not withdraw from the young woman however, after an instant's worth of realization and hesitation he resolves not to leave Kalaria alone at all. "He'll leave us be Kali. He will." Having moved in close, the young human stands up close to Kali as though to shield her with himself somehow in the semi-dark of the computer room. Thandrim's voice is quiet, little more than a hissing whisper to cut through not with volume but intensity.
[hide]"Breathe now Kali, he cannot harm you. He will not harm you, or anyone. That rage and hate cannot bring his dreams of suffering forth. He is letting it control him, don't let it control YOU, stay with me. *Look* at me. *Look* at me." Hoping to bring Kalaria's face around in an effort to give her some of his own forced control over what surrounds them. There can be no denying it, she feels it just as much as he. Yet she has not training, no backing to hold her steady against the tidal wave.[/hide]

She repeats Kali's words quietly as she does so.

Kali trembles, so pale, so helpless right now after her screams, her eyes darting to Thandrim, wide as proverbial saucers as she looks at him. For a moment the young woman seems to start to relax, and she looks at Thandrim anew, and with relief.
And then that moment, too is gone. A sharp gasp is heard from Kalaria and her hands grab hold of Thandrim, clinging to him while her eyes seem to focus ... elsewhere. She is frozen, frozen where she is for a matter of heartbeats, clinging to Thandrim, trembling, radiating fear. "He … heard me. He's … he's found me. I need to go. I must go. If I can't watch you die he may not kill all of you," she stammers out in a panic. Now the young woman starts to try and push Thandrim away, to flee from him, to leave the computer room, to leave the ship, to find a way off of the asteroid, far away from the Last Hope, and her friends. If she isn't there to watch them die... maybe he wont' kill them!

'Whatever the frak you lot want to do on this ship, can I suggest you get it done *fast* so we can leave? The way this is turning out I'd rather be taking my chances getting to the lifts.'

However, there seems to be a calming presence about Thandrim and Kali does manage to calm her panic long enough to catch snippits over her shoulder, and to peer out the computer room door. Pale, and small, and very frightened, Kali looks up to Thandrim. "Gamoreans? More?" is asked with a loud swallow as Kali looks away and then over her shoulder. "You've got to help.

Between the moment of Kalaria's question and the both of them hearing the reports from their companions on the new yet old threat coming out, Thandrim is able to comment quietly. "You can be. You will need to be." Not exactly how he'd best phrase it, but there isn't time for anything else. "Come on, we should get to where you were heading before. With Garic and the others too. You are more help than you may realize." Spoken as he squeezes out of the doorway first, then rushes forward some where the others are taking up positions.
Responding first to Anazider's own annoyed tone, the boy has little to offer, "I'm afraid there is no time for any answers, or any of us. We've got to get further into the ship! And take that, *thing* with us if we can." Though by the distances offered, it does not seem likely even to him that it would be possible.

This has not been one of your best days and now with a Rodian unconscious on the ground and a couple of Gamorreans just around the corner you are all wanting this day to be done. Whats worse many of the encounters today have not given anyone the time for much of anything to sink in. Just when you start thinking things could not be more complicated all of your comms go off on an open channel (something that can only be done from the bridge).
"This is Captain Drefi .... calling to Anaziders and crew. We have been ordered by Blotus the Hutt .... to have you all arrested and turned over to his men. You are accused of crimes against personal property of Blotus the Hutt. I have .... done all that I could for you .... I wish there was more I cou. All exits have been blocked our own security forces have been ordered to assist the Hutts men, there is no way off the ship .... no way you could ever reach the upper hangers."
As Captain Drefi talks you can hear a Hutts laughter which is joined by what you would imagine as many thugs with him, you also hear blasters being loaded and Blotus barking orders to his men.
Captain Drefi continues "Do what is in your best interests ...... and surrender. May the force be with you Drefi out."

" While that goon was giving us his poor pitiful me speech I heard Blotus ordering his men to shoot to kill!" His emotions were getting the best of him and he takes a deep breath to calm down. "There is no getting off the damn ship alive tif THEY have anything to say about it!"

Anazider takes a brief moment to search the limp form of the Rodian, keeping his blaster trained in the direction of the Gamorrean oinkings. Amidst his inspection, the nobleman notices the indicator on his datapad flickering, causing him to grouse at the prospect of his investments possibly floundering at a moment like this. Perusing the datapad, Anazider smirks to himself, stowing the little computer away before rising fully to his feet.
"Perhaps we've an ally, or some measure of luck left. The personnel lifts have been frozen due to some 'unknown hazard', but the ore lifts are still functioning. Generally it is the reverse when the mine shuts down. Whether blessing or bait, the ore lifts are our means of escape. I would suggest we quickly conclude our business here, and make a hasty retreat."
Anazider wipes the hand he used to search the Rodian on his pants, a sour frown of disgust twisting his lips. He surveys the area almost unconcernedly, but a cold, calculating steel has replaced the unbridled emotion he had exhibited earlier.

A glance over at Alishai and the girl nods, moving to the Rodian and crouching in an attempt to retrieve the little green man's blaster. Her fingers curl around the handle a bit too tightly and Kali forces herself to close her eyes and inhale deeply, trembling as she does so.
"We need to go. We don't have time to fight here if possible. We're looking for something, my guess is in one of the cargo holds. And we need to destroy it. Or this particular ship itself. We need to do that, then leave. Come on, please. I.. I … " Kali shakes her head back and forth and scurries away from the rodian to look down the only corridor option to them. She glances at everyone, Anazider, Garic, Alishai, Thandrim, all with a pained, shaken expression, before hovering like she wanted to break off into a run down the corridor.

The two Gamorreans come into the corridor, both Garic and Alishai snap off shoots at the new threat. Garics shoot is wild hitting the ceiling briefly illuminating the two thugs, Alishai`s shot hits the first Gamorrean square in the chest. The Gamorrean takes a step forward a look of confusion on his face before falling to the floor. The second Gamorrean on seeing his companion fall so easily turns to run the way he came in.

Alishai glances at Anazider, then shivers. She then turns her attention to Kali, nodding her acceptance of the young girl's words. Lastly, she looks to Thandrim.
'How many are out there?' She asks, gesturing along the corridor to the exit.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-11-07 10:59:52)

A sudden shiver flows through Kali as she looks at Anazider's hand, of all things. Then the young woman is staggering back into the corridor with wide eye s and paling skin again, pointing the pistol at the nobleman. "Anazider! Put down that box! It is a bad black box! Put it down… NOW! NOW! Thandrim!! It was glowing red! It's bad! Very bad!" she cries out, before flicking her eyes up to meet Anazider's in fear and worry, before looking back to the box the noble holds.

'I would say that's a perfect reason not to leave it in the hand of one of Blotus' goons, Kali.' Alishai comments in a somewhat strained voice. 'We can discard it later, where no one will find it.'

### **Thandrim** (2007-11-07 12:03:43)

"There is no way to tell how many await us there, but that is not the most pressing concern. That box is. It is not a question of leaving it behind, Alishai. *That* is what the Rodian wanted to kill us over. Thandrim's eyes are locked upon the box presently, a dark frown upon his lips. "There is no investment value in that, Anazider. It MUST be destroyed.. now.." The young human begins to reach up one of the sleeves of his shirt for something. "It cannot be risked to even fall from our hands into others."

---

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2007-11-07 21:38:52)

Anazider tosses one of the Rodian's heavy blaster pistols to Kalaria and the other to Thandrim, also handing a spare power pack to each. He doesn't address the concerns of the two youths until he stows away the other items, eyeing the retreating Gammorrean's back. The nobleman runs the fingertips of his right hand over the box, the contact causing him to lurch slightly in nausea before discards the feeling with a shake of the head. Placing the box in the rodian's sack, he ties it to his belt.
"Whatever itch you have up that sleeve, Thandrim, I would think that blaster would serve better then scratching it. It is unknown if destroying this box will cause it to explode violently, killing us all, or make this decidedly decrepit vessel become less stable. Throw in the unknown number of Blotus's thugs, and their unwillingness to spare us the time to do away with the trinket, and I think that is enough unknowns to not act upon it until our safety is assured. *It* won't be in danger of falling into the Hutt's slimy hands because *I* have no intention of doing the same. Let us leave here."

Garic watches at the Gammorean hauls for the opposite direction and smirks. *We will meet again I'm sure.* He says to himself. Then he brings his attention around to the others, Of Kali's surprising horror over the box. Garic listens to each person in turn before speaking his own mind. "I say we bring the box, and get out of here." He speaks low, hoping it will force the other to calm down enough to hear his words. "Were waisting valuable time just standing here."

### **simplyscribed** (2007-11-08 22:12:09)

'Agreed.'
Alishai spares no more words on the discussion, instead moving along the corridor towards the ship's entrance. She stops at the corner, readies her blaster, then risks a look around the corner. If she sees a target she fires upon them before stepping back out of sight.
((OOC: Risking exposure to enemy attack to attain situation and maybe make an attack of my own. Half cover at the time. Then step back into full cover. This is all providing someone doesn't stop her with a better idea of course - a little while will pass before she reaches the entrance to do it.))

### **chibiamy** (2007-11-08 22:43:50)

With a swift look spared to Garic, Kali bites her lower lip as she murmurs, "I have a bad feeling about this." However, that is all she says. The young woman squeezes her eyes shut momentarily and swallows hard before opening them again and glancing over to Thandrim, before looking to Alishai and finally Anazider. Nothing is said at all from that point as she shifts towards Garic, then reaches up and scrubs at her scalp, hair flying about in a messy haze memntarily before she waits to follow the others.

### **master_Tru** (2007-11-09 17:40:28)

You can hear the clanging again, it echos off through the corridors. Still stunned but not dead the Rodian can be heard breathing, his slumber seams disturbed as though he where having nightmares.
Alishai hold position at the escape hatch corridor, pecking around the corner she sees no sign of the Gamorrean of anything else. Though she can barley hear the Gamorrean`s snorts as it is in conversation, with who you can not tell the second voice sounds like Hutt before the communication ended.
Again the ship shakes, the vibrations travel throughout your bodies and the ship itself creating another dust storm. Still not sure what to do where to go or what the force has in store for your group next you all ponder your next move.

Garic hangs back, guarding the rear so everyone can get out safely. His mind is having what could only be described as overload. So much has gone on, to much to sit and see the moral aspect of each decision. That simple fact gnaws at Garic's heart, instill some doubt to his actions. He stands with his weapon at the ready with an almost dazed look etched on his face.

### **simplyscribed** (2007-11-11 20:28:04)

'Noone, the Gamorrean has gone further down the corridor.' Alishai murmurs as the others join her at the entrance. 'We probably won't get a better chance to leave the ship.'
'Garic, you and I will go first. Thandrim and Kali, stay close. Anazider, watch our backs. Let's go.'
That said, she leaves the ship, watchful for the unspecified dangers that no doubt await them outside.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-11-12 12:33:28)

Kalaria licks her lips nervously a moment. Then she turns and looks over the group with a heavy sigh. "We need to destroy that," she murmurs to no one but herself. Then, with a deep inhale and a glance to Thandrim, as if hoping he would support her, the young woman turns and reaches out for Garic's arm. "We all go. Come on. No one stays behind. I'm not loosing any of you."

---

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2007-11-12 18:49:28)

Frowning a little at the blaster now in his hand, Thandrim echo's Kalaria's own words. "And we will destroy it." That is all the boy has for words however as he moves to join the others in vacating the ship, and fast. No telling what kind of catastrophy awaits them if they remain in the 'buried' ship any longer. Surely even an endless supply of Gamorreans charging at them would be better. And so, off he goes.

### **Anazider** (2007-11-12 20:51:26)

Anazider nods slowly in agreement with Alishai, allowing the others to pass before him as he takes up the rear guard. The nobleman holds his blaster high in his right hand, his left hand maintaining a grip on the leather sack tied to his belt.
"For the ore lifts then. I do so hope letting that little piglet escape will not be our undoing."

### **master_Tru** (2007-11-13 07:38:26)

As you leave the ancient ship it groans in protest causing more dust to settle, youâ€™re all sure the ship could have collapsed at any time. Continuing through the tunnels back the way your group entered the first thing you notice is the lack of noise from the drill. When you enter the cavern the drill is off, which happens during a mine shut down there are also several mine carts scattered within the cavern also off.
Heading for the ore lifts your group continues through the tunnel towards the mine entrance and the lifts. The 100 meter walk gives your team some much needed downtime to verbalize recent events, if only a little time.

As your group closes the distance to the lifts you can hear a banging followed by snorts and grunts. Just as you reach the T-intersection to the lifts two axe wielding Gamorreans enter the tunnel you are in. Wide eyed axes high they both bellow out grunts before charging your group. Past the Gamorreans you can see the light playing shadows others across the ground, when the two Gamorreans shout out their battle cry you can barley hear the static of a comm turning on.

*I really wish I had an autofire-capable weapon.* Alishai reflects. Not one to spend precious time bemoaning what could have been, she determines to make the best she can of a bad situation. And it is a *very* bad situation. She knows that even if the Force is with her the odds aren't in her favour and if she can improve them for her companions by expenditure of her own life it will be a price gladly paid.
'You take the right one, Garic!' She cries, firing on the Gamorrean to the left, hoping to slow his charge or better yet stop him dead.

### **Rowen** (2007-11-15 08:02:00)

Garic nods at Alishai and braces with a two hand hold on the weapon and a wide stance for balance. He knows this shot has to count and a accurate shot could give them all the precious time needed to get away.

### **Thandrim** (2007-11-15 15:38:23)

With a distasteful look on his face, Thandrim raises the blaster in hand to take a shot at the right Gamorrean. Even so, he does not stop moving, hoping that they have not been cut off just yet. More importantly, he is not willing to give their enemies any more chance of doing so than they already have. "Come on! No stopping, go go go!"

Kali licks her lips, closes her eyes, and momentarily tries to calm herself. Then she opens them and looks back over at Thandrim, before gnawing on her lower lip. "I'm fine. I'll be fine. Just … Gotta do something. No, wait, I don't. I need time to figure out what is going on. I'm so confused."
A glance is given the blaster in her hands, before she looks at Thandrim again, almost wincing. Her eyes seek out Garic, watching him, pained, confused, before she glances over at Alishai. Kalaria says nothing, she just looks away and gives a nod in Anazider's direction. A deep inhale, a furtive last glance at the pistol, and then Kalaria looks up, trying to focus herself, to calm herself, before the pistol is leveled and she begins firing at the approaching Gamoreans.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-11-16 17:08:46)

-Alishai takes a shot at one of the Gamooreans, with a smoking hole on its chest stares blankly at Alishai before falling face first to the ground.
-Thandrim seeing one threat down releases a shoot off at the other Gamorrean. Scoring a critical head shoot on the Gamorrean, the thug falls sliding another meter before it stops.
-Anazider pauses after seeing both of the current threats eliminated.
-Kali finds the blaster handed to her by Anazider earlier.
-Garic keeps aim on the tunnel entrance, for a moment nothing seems to happen.
You barley recognize one of the fallen Gamorreans as the one who ran from the ship. The light gets closer and from around the corner a massive Gamorrean comes barreling out at a full charge. This Gamorrean has red paint across his face, no a closer look reveals it to be blood. The vibro axe it wields looks huge easily as tall as a man.

'Why is it always Gamorreans?' Alishai complains slightly breathlessly. She continues her advancement along the corridor, firing on the new target and trusting in her companions and herself to take him down before she comes in slashing range of that massive axe.

-Anazider squeezes off a shoot but only manages to strike the ceiling.The data pad Anazider carries buzzes with activity though currently this only acts as an annoyance to the Nobel. The Gamorrean covers the distance to Alishai, and with a mighty swing grazes Alishai`s shoulder. Though the Gamorrean only nicks the shoulder the would cuts deep soiling Alishai`s upper torso in blood. (( 13 Damage to Alishai)) The Gamorrean lets out a growl that almost shakes the ground, at the very least your core then it sets its eyes on Anazider.

Alishai cries out as the axe slices across her shoulder, renewing the pain she has been suppressing from the wound already present on her back.
*I'm not going to be able to stand much more of this!*
She turns her upper body as the Gamorrean passes, continuing to fire on it even as she continues moving to tunnel corner. She stops there, presses her back against the wall - and ignoring the complaints her body makes when she does so - and takes a sideways glance around the corner, expectant of yet more foes between them and the lifts.

Swallowing hard, Thandrim is brought up short from attempting to continue to run toward what the group hopes will be a safe route away. That monster of a Gamorrean isn't stopping, and looks more than ready to kill them all if it has a chance. Somewhat like a certain other alien they left behind. Not to mention the other more controlled shooter back there. They so very much NEED to destroy that bloody box. Yet that still must wait a moment. That mad Gamorrean must be stopped first, and so while the boy continues to move toward safety, he nonetheless does something that likely will end whatever hopes he had of keeping the last two of his companions 'in the dark.' Extending one hand toward the angry alien, his face works with effort to do. . . something.

-Alishai fires off a shoot at the thuggish Gamorrean on the run, the shoot flies high over head. Reaching the T-intersection she looks around the corner and comes face to face with a short thin bugged eyed Rodian. The Rodian looks visibly shaken as he holds his blaster pistol even more so now that you are staring him down.
- Thandrim reaches out with his hand you can see the concentration on his face. The Gamorrean continues on his rampage towards Anazider.
- Anazider fires off a shoot at the Gamorrean as it barrels towards him. The shoot reflects harmlessly off the ground, the Gamorrean slams its axe aiming to end Anazider in one swing. The axe slams into the ground next to the noble spraying rock and dirt onto the nobles clothes. Shouting in anger at Anazider the Gamorrean yells out a battle cry which sprays the noble more then anything.
-The Rodian takes a step back and tries to point his blaster at Alishai, the shoot goes wild into the tunnel wall.
-Kali shouts out "Go away! We did nothing to you, leave us alone." Obviously scared Kali squeezes off a shoot at the Gamorrean scoring a hit on the Gamorreans back. It ignores the threat.

-Alishai fires on the scared Rodian, it is shaken and jumpy but Alishai scores a hit to its left shoulder. The shoot knocks the Rodian to a knee, though it manages to hold onto its blaster.
-Thandrim fires on the Gamorrean hitting it in the abdomen, at first it would appear as though the brute would shake off this wound as well until the bleeding started. Thandrim managed to gravely wound the beast, though sheer force of will or anger the Gamorrean continues to advance on Anazider.
-Anazider not sure what to do pauses, another mighty swing from the Gamorrean puts Anazider into a defensive roll. The Gamorrean`s swing so powerful almost turns he around to face Garic, almost. The swing goes only an inch from Anazider`s head, an assortment of life flashes through the Falleens mind.
-The Rodian still shaken and on one knee fires a shoot off at Alishai, had the Rodian not been injured the shoot might have hit Alishai. Cradling its wounded shoulder the Rodian takes aim at the human woman again.
-Seeing the Rodians resolve Kali lets off a shoot which hits the ground closer to Alishai then the Rodian. ((critical miss))

The Gamorreans have practically cornered this market for some time now…" Anazider keeps his head on a swivel as he talks to Alishai, holding his blaster high in his right hand while sparing a few glances to read the datapad in his left. He steers the group towards the ore lift, frowning at the symbols on his datapad.
"…But yes, Blotus seems to have quite the retinue. There are still too many missing pieces here."

Walking the tunnel towards the ore lift many thoughts run through your characters minds. Its only a short time since your mine shift ended and so much has happened, an whatâ€™s to come. Once you pass the personal lift, which is active and on its way down you head for the ore lift. Ore carts line up as if to load the lift, though all are inactive. The ore lift itself is rotating rapidly all the 2m by 1m buckets are empty, and to the side of the open entrance is a rudimentary control panel. At the current speeds the lift is rotating one would have to jump inside possibly becoming jammed between the bucket and the rough stone walls. While you examine the lift about 15m down the tunnel the personal lift begins to beep indicating that the lift will soon arrive.

Alishai turns and points her pistol along the corridor to the personnel lift.
'Somebody stop that thing so we can get on!'

### **Thandrim** (2007-12-07 13:28:46)

Arriving at the ore lifts Thandrim seems to have fully recovered his calm, no longer beckoning everyone forward quickly so much. A touch disappointing that Anazider did not give him the box, but it was an outside chance anyway. "It makes enough sense, if he *was* looking for Jedi." The youth turns his head to regard Kali, even managing a small patient smile to go along with focused eyes and a slight head-nod toward the ore lifts. "The lift, if you please Kalaria." Calm is required, for more than simply the group's sake too.
Thandrim then lets himself frown, just a hair, before looking down the tunnel toward the personnel lift. The look does not last however as the boy's eyes close and his body tenses, even letting the blaster pistol drop from his hand, it looks like he is concentrating on something very hard. Hard enough for his fists to clench as he otherwise stands stock still and tensed.

A glance is given Thandrim and Kali's eyes go wide as she suddenly gives the youth plenty of room, skirting around him as he seems to be concentrating on something. Kalaria then looks over at Alishai and nods, pulling out her datapad and sliding up to the Ore lift controls. I'm not going to slow it down alot," notes the young woman, glancing over her shoulder at Thandrim, before back at the datapad. "Enough for us to jump on, a delay for me to jump on, then I'll speed it up again. We're on our own for jumping off, I think. Time is off the essence, right?"
((OOC: Use Computers to interface with the lift controls, slow it down enoughto jump on, a delay for Kali to jump on. If I can use my datapad to slow it down to get off, cool. If not a program to slow it down for us to jump on right at the last moment to exit. Otherwise... no slowing it down at all once it's up to speed again. Make sense? And, of course, Force Point... actually, Destiny Point. I want this to work, and work well. We need to get out of here.))

"Too true. Well, let us be about it then, think I'm beginning to run out of power packs, and I don't know how many more offending tunnel walls we'll need to fire upon."
Anazider smirks sarcastically, keeping his blaster trained on the personnel lift. He lifts the datapad, constantly checking it for any sign of change or update, the sardonic grin slowly fading away as further danger approaches.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-12-12 12:10:41)

While Alishai and Anazider cover the group Kali makes her way to the control panel and Thandrim focuses on the ore carts. The control panel itself is fairly basic though the grey panel does look out of place crudely bolted to the amber tunnel wall. While Kali punches in a few commands, to which the system takes easily Thandrims concentration results in some of the ore carts lifting off the ground and floating towards the personal lift. Thandrim keeps his focus on the four sturdy carts and manages to make a neat 2 by 2 pile in front of the personal lift. Kali slows the ore lift down, and does so with ease its a good thing she has been working with these systems for years. The personal lift continues beeping the lift is almost here.

### **chibiamy** (2007-12-12 13:19:10)

As Kalaria glances over her shoulder, her eyes grow slightly wide seeing the nice little stack that Thandrim has made. She blinks twice then clears her throat, "Into the ore lift, Force-Boy," she grumbles, looking at the panel then to the others. "You, too" the young woman orders. " I'm the last in. Now, come on. Who knows how long Thandrim's diversion will last! And now that this one is slowing down, they'll notice it and send people to this shaft as well."

'Don't be hard on yourself.' Alishai comments quietly, stepping onto the lift behind the Falleen.
'I didn't notice either.'

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2007-12-17 12:36:31)

Looking somewhat drained, Thandrim exhales slowly to observe the work he's managed to accomplish. Those carts cannot hold forever, but they should at least keep his friends from being shot up as they make their way up. Climbing aboard a slowed ore cart to the ascent he passes a look at Kalaria before speaking in a subdued voice. "Don't call me 'force-boy' unless you want me to start calling you 'tech-girl."

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2007-12-17 12:51:20)

An eyebrow arches upwards as Thandrim as he passes. "And what would you do if I said I found that a compliment," is asked in subtle tease. Kali actually finds herself smiling at the 'Force-Boy's back before she blinks and scowls. Bending down, she picks up the nearest rock and throws it at him without a word before hopping into her own cart and riding the lift up.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-12-18 17:53:07)

Kali is the last to enter the dubious ore carts, just in time to hear the personal lift doors open followed by a series of grunts and stomping. The carts make the long climb slowly towards the loading floor, with the recent lock down you could only hope that standard procedure was followed which would leave the area empty. The ride up was rough enough with all the bumps and scraping, the trip ends when the carts cast you out one by one. You all fall into a pile at the bottom of what must be dirt, the room is pitch black. Light suddenly blinds your vision and a voice is heard "I can`t believe I found you." You hear the sound of a blasters safety being released "Drop your weapons hands where I can see them ... the bounty is mine."
When your eyes adjust a middle aged woman stands in front of you an old scare runs under her amber hair to her chin you recognize her as Tinian Lar a resident on Last Hope, though not a survivor of Aloon she was picked up a few years back when a small trade agreement was opened with a few local systems. Tinian stands holding a blaster on your group behind her is a large double door exit which leads to the ship corridors. The loading floor room is large 10m high 20m by 20m square, the are inactive ore carts two several piles of dirt/ore and three labour droids. The labour droids not part of the ships computer core continue their work of loading the inactive ore carts oblivious to your current situation. Tinian cracks her knuckles as she awaits your compliance.

### **chibiamy** (2007-12-18 18:51:49)

"Yeah, yeah, oooh, big bad bounty hunter found us and wants us to drop our weapons," comments Kali sarcastically. "Hate to tell you this, but I think I already dropped it in the tumble out of the cart, so, you'll forgive me for not following your orders." The young woman groans as she rolls over, and tries to glance towards the woman's directions, before looking back at the lift. "Okay, JUST because I'm tired of being shot at, I'm going to stand up now, and go shut down this ore lift, so whoever was chasing us down in the mine, doesn't decide to follow us up. Okay?" ask Kalaria slowly rising to her feet, leaving the blaster behind, for now. She watches Tinian Lar for a moment, then turns to move towards the panel, pulling out her datapad and looking over it. "Give me a few moments," she says over her shoulder, but more in Alishai's direction, than Tinian's.
((OOC: Okay, trying to bluff (or whatever that is called). Pretend to slow down the ore lift, heck, maybe I even will, but really, trying to hack into those droids with my datapad and get them to turn on Tinian, creating a surprise, and thus giving everyone else an opprotunity to rush past her, or neutralize the woman! Hey, look, Kali thinks sometimes!))

Garic picks him self up slowly. His muscles bruised and protesting at even the smallest movement. His eye widen slightly at the turn of events as he see's the bounty hunter before him. He silently applauds Kali's quick thinking. Hopeing Kali has the womans attention Garic attempts to get his feet under him in order to spring forward and tackle the woman to the ground. His eyes locked on to her weapon while he uses his peripheral vision to watch her body language.

'Tinian, you don't really want to do this.' Alishai states calmly. 'We're not criminals. We're not even strangers who you can hand over into the slimy hands of a Hutt without ever hearing from your conscience.' Here she looks meaningfully at Thandrim, hoping he gets the idea and aids her ploy.
'We're people you've lived with and worked with for years. Maybe you think you can live with that if catching us means you can bargain your way off this rock? Don't bet on the justice of a Hutt. If he lets you go it's only because he thinks he can use you later. Escape with us.'

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2007-12-19 13:13:25)

Anazider rises slowly from the dirt floor, dusting himself off as if there weren't someone pointing a blaster at him. He confronts Tinian with a disarming smile, the expression at odds with the tension of the situation. Holstering his sporting blaster, Anazider holds his hands out to the side and palms up to show that he is unarmed.
"You know that Alishai is correct, ms. Lar. There is little cause for you to do this. If it is escape you are after, we can provide that. If it is the bounty, you'll find that I have more than enough credits to provide compensation. There is no need for anything… unfortunate to occur here, so what do you say?" The prince says this with a sultry catch to his voice, allowing some of his natural essence to carry across the tunnel with his words.
((Persuasion on Tinian, make use of Pheromones if the roll is 5 or below.))

### **master_Tru** (2007-12-19 17:37:43)

At Kali`s movements Tinian`s blaster follows, before she can speak Alishai`s words give her pause as if she where considering other options. "I have responsibilities, I donâ€™t want ...â€ Hey little girl stop right there." Tinian holds aim at Kali.
Anaziders words seem to get more interest out of Tinian, she half lowers her pistol. â€œThis is not me I never wanted it to go down this way." again she cracks her knuckles â€œI have to get out of here, I have lost all cont .... What are we talking in the way of credits can you really get me off this station?" Tinian holds her blaster ready; her stance indicates some training possibly military she stands ready waiting for your groupâ€™s next move.

### **Thandrim** (2007-12-19 18:31:16)

Coughing a couple times into his fist due to the accumulated dust in the room, Thandrim slowly gets himself up. Rolling out of that cart wasn't quite as fun as he remembered it being four years ago when he snuck up there to avoid a certain mining foreman's attention. That *was* a good prank he pulled then though wasn't it? As it is however, the constant sting from his chest cut and irritation from the grime isn't helping the 'fun' of the situation at all. A dust-ridden hand brushed through dust-ridden hair before the boy looks to the new 'threat.' A small smile touches Thandrim's lips as his own words join in with the efforts of the others. "If it is not you, then do not do it. I suggest you come with us then, as I fear for the time being everyone else **is** going to be stuck here. Until we can return at any rate. Certainly no one from his place will be leaving in Blotus's good graces. Nobody." The youth looks ready to depart the room, though there is still a woman in the way.

Garic continues to wait patiently. His hand slowly scoops up any loose gravel he can get hold of. If things go sour at least he could blind the woman and jump her before anyone gets hurt.
*Wait a second….* He watches her closer. *She's lowering her guard…..* He pulls his foot in closer behind him to provide the spring he will need. *Wait…..its looks like she may listen to reason….*

### **chibiamy** (2007-12-19 21:58:31)

Kali barley hesitates. "Look, seriously, I'm going to slow maybe even stop this ore lift, okay?" comments Kalaria as she moves to the panel. "None of us want Blotus' men coming up here the same way we did. And they're still in the personal lift last we checked so could be back up here by now. You don't want them to get **YOUR** bounty after all, right? Let's do what Thandrim said, he's being reasonable. Let's just … go. Walk out that door, and talk things over when the urgancy of Blotus' men being just around the corner isn't weighing on us."
With that, Kali's attention is fully on the ore lift as she tries to disable it. If at all possible she'll lock it down with one of her own encryptions so it takes time to unlock it. Time is important right now. So says the racing of the young woman's heart. She can hear it in her ears and feel the organ trying to beat right out of her chest!

Alishai gets to her feet, seeing as Tinian seems on her way to be convinced. The security officer steps in between the bounty hunter and Kali though, just in case. She is the most likely right now to cause Tinian to act rashly, and Alishai will be damned if she lets something happen to the girl if she has the power to prevent it.

### **Anazider** (2007-12-23 22:06:55)

"I've… some measure of wealth," the prince winks at Tinian, still grinning in a disarming fashion, "So name your price. And your best chance for escaping this rock is in coming with us. I know Blotus's type: they expect someone else to do the dirty work, and aren't exactly keen on paying them afterwards. You will find me to be a much more honest, and lucrative, employer."
Anazider doesn't even so much as glance at the others, as he keeps his attention fully locked onto the woman holding the blaster. Internally he was boiling over the various ongoings, but not a hint of it showed across his smiling countenance.
((Will continue the persuasion))

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2007-12-24 08:50:07)

AT Thandrims argument Tinian does lower her blaster all the way, though it is still held at the ready. Tinian seams confused even shaken her head a few times, she cracks her knuckles again "I donâ€™t want it to go like this, I have duties of my own just like you I wish there was anoth ...."
Tinian eyes Garic with suspicion then looks to Kali "Go ahead shut down the ore lift, not that it will do you much good there are more on this level and even more in the upper hangers." Given this opportunity Kali easily shuts the ore lift down, and even manages to change the access codes to the ore lift itself.
As Alishai moves to cover Kali Tinian attention is now focused on her she changes her stance again, a more defensive stance. With Anaziders smooth words a few tears start before Tinian composes herself. "I have lost contact with my home world, I ..... need to get back you would do the same. Blotus has put a bounty of one thousand credits on you, though he has no offer to leave this place. I need to get home I have family friends and.... Something is wrong there I have to go. How will you get off this station?" Tinian pauses to think for a moment then lowers her head "I need to get to a space port and enough credits to get home promise me that and I will help. There are two Gamorreans patrolling the hallway outside this room." Tinian still holding her blaster awaits the response from your group.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2007-12-24 10:40:44)

"I offer you one thousand credits now, and another *two thousand* credits once we are all safely away. Once we gain a ship we can possibly take you to your location. If that doesn't suit, three thousand credits should be enough to buy you passage from one end of the galaxy to the other, and in veritable luxury as well."
While he is speaking, Anazider slowly moves a hand to draw several credit chips from a hidden lining in his robe: four five-hundred markers, and one one-thousand. He looks ahead past Tinian for any sign of pursuit or alert. The prince returns to holding his hands above his head, making sure the credits and their amounts are clearly displayed.
"But we must be about this quickly. The more time we spend dawdling, the more opportunity Blotus has to put an end to our plans of escape. Along the way, you can fill us in on what exactly has happened to the colony, and what Blotus wants."

'With all of the security focused on Blotus' presence and trying to catch us, the transport shuttles used to take the ore offworld should be relatively unguarded. That will change quickly though, Blotus is smart enough to realise they're our most likely target.' Alishai comments, vocalizing her thought processes on how best to escape.
'Or... We assume he's already prepared for that... And steal *his* ship.'

Garic stands slowly, being careful not to move to fast. His hand still holds the dirt in case things go sour. His hopes are high that she will grasp at the chance to leave this rock. Money is a great motivator at times, but her needs require more. He watches hoping that in her irrational state she still manages to make the right decision.

### **chibiamy** (2007-12-26 12:18:48)

"Um…. We could also ask Lacys," notes Kali as she steps away from the control panel and looks at the rest of the group. "She showed up with a new ship just before all this started, you know. We need a diversion to get there. I could probably manage that if you give me enough time at a computer terminal. Do we need to get anything else before making a break for it?"
Kalaria is desperately trying NOT to empathize with Tinian's words. She's got enough to think about, and remembering what happened seven years ago that left her, alone, on this rock, isn't exactly what Kalaria wants to be brooding about. But, one keen of eye, might note the subtle tightening of the woman's back, the stiffening of her movements, and the way she wiped her eyes before turning around.

### **master_Tru** (2007-12-27 07:52:02)

Tinian`s jaw drops at the mention of three thousand credits though she quickly composes herself. "I am afraid I donâ€™t have much Intel on the current situation I was working a double shift when the lock down was ordered. Though on my way to quarters I had overheard two Rodians talking about a bounty on two female humans one male, a male Zabrak and a male Falleen though I donâ€™t think they knew much beyond that. The Rodians said something about some of their men engaging the target, but I was hurried to quarters and did not hear much more then that. The local security has been ordered into the search for you, some have been forced to scout for Blotus`s men."
Tinian attention goes to Garic again she cracks her knuckles, holsters her blaster tapping it a few times as she gives a wink Garics way. At Alishai`s mention of stealing Blotus`s ship Tinian laughs " Wow you guys are brave storming a fully crewed destroyer, maybe one of the support ships in the lower hangers would be easier."

A slightly quirked eye is directed Anazider's way with his rather generous offer. Taking the moment to rest himself a touch and check to ensure his wound is not quite yet ready to open up again Thandrim listens and comments quietly. "It'll need to be a fast ship, if we are to avoid pursuit. If anyone were to have a fast vessel, it will be Miss Lacys." Simple enough, right? A curious look is then followed to Alishai regarding her own, mysterious box.

"Well, be that as it may, we'll get nowhere by standing around and chatting." Anazider says in reply to Thandrim and Kalaria. He strides past Tinian, tossing her the one-thousand credit marker as he peaks looking both ways down the corridor past Tinian. He draws his blaster, setting it to kill as he does so.

Garic relaxes as she places her blaster back in the holster. Feeling a little silly for having kept the dirt in his hand he lets it go and watches as it falls back to the ground blow. He looks around to the others and a small smile forms on his lips. "Perhaps we will make it off this rock." He whispers to himself. However as far as personal belongings go, he has none worth the risk. "I have nothing I want from this place." He mumbles. He glances to Alishai and the rest in turn and shrugs.

### **chibiamy** (2007-12-29 19:44:55)

Kali watches both Alishai and then Thandrim in turn, before she finally blinks and stares blankly at Anazider. Slipping away from the panel, the yougn woman finds the heavy blaster that was haanded to her down below, before she falls into step with Garic. In an aside she leans towards the Zabrak and whispers, "Do I even want to know what ELSE that man has? 'Sides, i've got my spanner and my datapad and this is a better blaster than the one in my room. You an' I'll keep watch out. Sound like a deal?"

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-02 11:08:39)

As your group heads for the door and looks around the corner Tinian pulls out her blaster again readying herself as well. "Lacy's ship is not that fast, none of are ships are but they might not be ready for a hyper space jump." Tinian lowers her voice slightly " I just hope we find a ship that can make a jump."
Tinian pockets the credits given by Anazider and nods at him with a smile. "The personal quarters will be locked down as well, not sure how will will get past that, if we are lucky a slice might not be detected by the bridge."
When your group checks the corridor it is empty, something unheard of in a station this size. It almost give a strange feeling to see the corridors empty like this you know things have changed now and will never be the same again, what was home for seven years now feels foreign. Both Garic and Alishai hear heavy foot steps and low grunting coming from the left side of the corridor, all of you know that the personal lift to the quarters are on the right.

Pulling out her datapad, Kali nods and moves to follow Garic and Alishai. "Give me time and no one will know we were there," she says smoothely, prepping her slice into the system and what she wants to do, specifically. Just for added measure, she starts prepping a slice into the alarm systems to trigger off on another part of the Last Hope compared to where the ships are laying in wait.

Thandrim appears now to be quite alright with following along. The boy quietly moving with an ear cocked for signs of trouble. The only disruption to that was in fact an attempt to have Anazider unconsciously pass off the dark box to himself. Yet though he positioned himself, it appears that the noble is not quite ready to part with the thing still. Fortunately it is likely difficult to tell if he was disappointed by that, or just frowning as a reaction to that cut upon Thandrim's chest.

### **Anazider** (2008-01-02 22:34:33)

Anazider takes up the rear guard with Tinian, his blaster drawn and his head on a swivel for any sign of further ambush. The disarming smile he had for Tinian slowly melts away to be replaced by an emotionless mask, one that hides the cold fury slowly building within him. For a man that prided himself on being able to know and control things, this situation had well spun out of his control. And the weight of the object at his belt, as slight as it may seem, did nothing to better his mood.
"Where would a Hutt amass enough credits to buy a star destroyer? I've met, and personally know, some of the more wealthy starship corporation owners in the galaxy, and even they would think *twice* about purchasing one. Ever more the curious."

Turning right down the corridor you continue 10m before entering a T-intersection, careful to peck around the corner the hall is empty. The hall ends 8m down at two lift doors. Your group rounds the corner just as the foot steps start getting louder .
((I would like a marching order))
Head down Kali almost bumps into Thandrim, more focused on her upcoming task then her surroundings.
As you continue to the lifts Tinian turns to Anazider "Not a star destroyer nothing so big, just a regular destroyer." The sound of her cracking knuckles can be heard again "no its only a destroyer though they can pack a punch and from what I have heard Blotus dislikes most droids so his ship would be crewed without droids."
At the lifts the absence of lights on the control panel gives your group doubts to its functionality. Kali quickly checks it and confirms that the power has been turned off, not a common procedure during a lock down of the mines.

'Kali, can you get this thing on from here?' Alishai asks, now at the rear of the group and leveling her blaster back in the direction of the approaching footsteps. 'I don't remember whether it has an emergency power supply or not.'
((OOC: Alishai led the way, but on approach to the lifts would have shifted to the back of the group, between them and the approaching Gamorreans. Basically, she is trying to keep herself between her comrades and the most likely approach of danger at all times. Readied action to fire on the first hostile she sees.))

Garic pulls his blaster out and readies himself for any attack. He watches the exchange between Alishai to Kali and hopes the girl can get the panel functional. After seeing her prowess in the mines with the drill he doesn't doubt her skill.
He can't help but feel a little on edge and keeps wondering what can be so important that they need to risk everyone for a few personal belongings.
"Lets be quick about this!" He snaps in a whisper.

Kalaria grumbles. "Oh, bother. Okay, do we have an extra power cell? If so, put it in this gun," comments the young woman as she pops out the power cell of the heavy blaster she's carrying and tosses it towards Anazider momentarily. Then she pulls out her hydrospanner and another tool from her waist and starts to remove the panel, hoping to give it power, briefly, through the power cell from the blaster.

Alishai uses her spare hand to retrieve one of the power packs she carries, and gently tosses it in Anazider's direction.

### **Anazider** (2008-01-03 13:21:17)

"Oh good, I've become an errand boy as well. Will wonders never cease?" Anazider grumbles sourly, catching the blaster in his right hand and holstering his own blaster to catch the power pack in his left. He quickly secures the power pack in the weapon, deftly spinning the blaster in his hand to hand it back to Kalaria, hilt first. The prince remains between Alishai and Kalaria, sparing a glance over his shoulder for the power-less door before focusing his attention to where the Gamorrean grunts originate.
"Just a regular destroyer, right. That's much better. I'll have to ask dear Blotus where he shops..."

Kali begins to access the lifts control panel, at the same time the foot steps are getting closer and louder the Gamoreans are in some kind of conversation (though you could only imagine what would hold their limited intellect, perhaps you would prefer not to think about it). After what seams like ages Kali curses under her breath unable to restore power to the lift, she does manage to get the lift door open a crack.
With the Gamorreans closing in your group prepares for the worst, Tinian cracks her knuckles again checks her blaster holsters it then takes a deep breath. In a whisper Tinian says " Meet me at the lower hanger bay, I will try to have a ship ready." With that she walks out of the hall way towards the Gamorreans. "They are not looking for me."
"Oh hey there you are, I I was so scared there where stories of murders running the station. I was lost looking for my quarters when the lock down was signaled. Oh please could you escort me to safety?"
There are several grunts it is hard to tell if they will do as Tinian asks, everyone stands ready for the worst.
"Oh thank you, it is said that Blotus hires nothing but the best and bravest." The heavy foot falls start up again but fade away in the distance.

### **chibiamy** (2008-01-06 16:35:42)

Kali peers into the darkness of the lift shaft, then looks back to where Tinian had gone. "Garic, Thandrim, open these up? Looks like we're climbing." There is a pause and Kali frowns as she looks back at the lift. "This BETTER be worth the trouble," she notes under her breath.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2008-01-06 18:04:12)

"Gutsy. And she can think on her feet. I like that."
Anazider smirks as the last of the Gamorrean footsteps fade away down the corridor. He turns back to the lift doors, lending a hand in shoving them open enough to allow passage, before looking in for hand-holds for climbing.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2008-01-07 10:55:15)

Working with others to open the lift more fully, Thandrim lets go a quiet breath as he comments. "Yes she can. Hopefully she can rejoin us in time too, and without a Gamorrean escort. We really cannot leave without her now." Not if they are to keep their word anyway. The youth's eyes peer up the shaft as well as done once there is enough room to look.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Rowen** (2008-01-07 13:30:24)

Garic moves to assist Anazider in opening the doors. All the while smirking at the way Tinian handled the situation. "Lets just move a fast and safely as possible." He glances back at the rest. "I'm sure she will find a way to meet up with us."

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-09 06:43:58)

The door to the lift opens fairly easily but you have to hold it open or it will close on its own. The shaft is dark what little there is comes from the hallway and it only illuminates a few meters in front of you. To the side you find the access ladder its reflective yellow tape easily marks it in the darkness. As your group enters and begins to climb the ladder the lift door slowly closes briefly leaving your group in total darkness, a few glow rods make the climb a lot easier.
The personal quarters are four decks up your group makes the climb in a few minutes, with only a few near slips. Alishai is the first to open the lift door to give your group access to this area of the station. The lift door opens without much effort revealing an empty corridor, your close to Alishais quarters only three doors down the left on the T-intersection.
Peering around the T-intersection the corridors of this section of the station are empty no patrols no laughter no children playing only silence.

Alishai hurries to her door. She pauses outside just long enough to ascertain whether there are any sounds within before reaching out to the control.

### **Anazider** (2008-01-09 10:23:54)

Anazider flanks the door, looking up the corridor in the direction opposite from where they came.
"I hope you've been holding out on an Iridorian death squad, otherwise I may have some choice words to impart upon you. Although, I wouldn't mind recovering some of the more *important* documents from my office. Hmm..."

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Rowen** (2008-01-09 20:32:22)

Garic moves in behind Alishai and kneels, drawing his blaster out and aiming for the door. His leg braces his firing arm providing for a steadier shot.
"Its to quiet here." He says under his breath. "I don't like it."

Just looks, one way, then the other. "That may be, you if you two want your things, you have to go anyway.' Kali pauses, considers then starts to step forward. "Unless you want me to be the distraction and then you can slip in while I'm getting shot," she offers.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-11 20:54:59)

Checking every corridor close by they are all empty, no colonists no guards no one. Alishai reaches out to the controls to her quarters only to find it locked. By the look on Alishai`s face you can tell that even her codes will not give her access. Nearby are the quarters of the rest of the group all locked as well. The doors all have power and after Kali runs a quick check she is sure she could hack in with some time.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Rowen** (2008-01-12 10:00:18)

Garic stands still holding his blaster. "hmmm, is the entire place on lock down? Or did they figure we would attempt to go back for our things?" He motions to the panel. "I could shoot it." He adds with the slightest smirk.

"Probably just lockdown. Blotus is taking over, completely. And has a destroyer with lots and lots of guns aimed at the Last Hope. No doubt, it's panic as well," says kali as she works at the panel. "Gah! Don't blast it!" says the young woman with a hiss and mock glare at Garic. "That will alert them we were here. I'm going to try to hack in so they never ever even notice. … … I hope."

"Likely the entire facility is under such guard. If they thought we might come back for our belongings, they'd likely have taken them and made us come into their clutches." The prince remains standing, keeping an intense vigil on the corridor.
"But yes, less angst, more slicing. I don't believe our wily infiltration will remain unnoticed for much longer. And we've still an appointment to keep with ms. Tinian, and I've never been one for tardiness."

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-15 11:02:55)

Kali spends a few moments fumbling with the control panel to Alishia`s door. The rest of the group stands on guard, the halls still quite none enter the section you are in. The door to Alishia`s quarters open the light on the panel even stays red indicating that the system reports the door as being closed. Using the same set of commands Kali is able to open the other doors as well.
((If anyone needs into there quarters to gather their belongings now is the time, all your quarters are in this section and close by. Let me know in a PM or in game what you are gathering from your quarters.))

'I'll be right back.' Alishai says, disappearing into her room. She opens up the closet and drags out a mid-size security box. Quickly she punches the access key into the box's simple but relatively secure electronic locking system, then opens the lid part-way to access its contents.
The security guard smiles as she gazes on the items within, artifacts from her past suddenly part of her present once more. With all the care and precision due an act of ceremony, she withdraws her lightsaber, sleek and silver, grasping it tightly in her hands. The moment passes, and she conceals it within her clothing.
*The armour will have to wait.* Alishai decides, snapping the container closed again. She picks it up in both hands and moves towards the door. Nearly there she halts and looks around at her dresser. Sitting there are her shades, worn on casual occasions - few and far between these days. She grins. Nobody could claim she's on duty now.
And so in a short time Alishai returns through the doorway of her quarters, carrying a security box and wearing what those assembled understand to be her only concession to vanity.

Anazider darts into his apartment and returns a short while later, his work clothes doffed in favor of of a flowing tunic and surcoat combination of exceedingly expensive cut and quality, made to accentuate the Falleen's figure and complexion. The prince spends a moment arranging his hair with one hand while settling several documents in his leather sack with the other
"My favorite traveling coat... Well, at least out of the ones I have here. I've everything I came for, how about yourself?" He eyes Alishai as she exits her room, giving her a cursory inspection to see if he can spy what she took from the dorm.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2008-01-15 17:40:49)

"You have too many clothes, Anazider," notes Kalaria as she waits for Alishai. As each person files out of the room, Kali works to lock down the doors again.
The young woman stands in front of her own door for a long moment, looking at it, then looking at the heavy blaster that has been picked up at her side. Turning away, without opening it, Kali initiates a command on her datapad to thoroughly wipe any programs she has running inside the closet she spends most of her time in.
"I'm done here. Let's leave this place behind us. For some of us, it's pretty much bitter memories," grumbles the young woman as she walks for the lift again, planning on slipping inside before anyone actually tries to talk to her.

Having stayed in the hallway along with Garic, Thandrim is silent and grey faced still. Hands now folded about his chest as he looks up and down the passageway. He is doing his level best to *not* look at Anazider presently.

With all your gear gathered your group is ready for the unknown. With none of Blotus`s patrols of Gamorreans or Rodians looking to gun you down your group relaxes a little easier. This is one of the few sections of the ship that looks original, many of the other sections being jury rigged and patched so many times over they are almost unrecognizable from the original state. The white well light walls and wide corridors with light blue carpet have always been keep in good condition.
Kali makes sure all the doors are closed, satisfied that the slice was not detected she signals an OK. Anaziders data pad begins to beep again, this time it shows a flashing green dot over the lower hanger bay.

### **Anazider** (2008-01-17 13:12:07)

"Appears we have the green light, ladies and gentlemen. Lets see what awaits us."
Anazider adjusts the fit of his surcoat one last time, nodding to himself in acceptance before briskly making his way away from the crew quarters, intent on the lower hangars. He keeps his blaster drawn, held up in a practiced ready position. His free hand strays to the ever-present sack at his waist, checking to make sure its secure.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2008-01-17 13:47:23)

Kali starts to get clear, then stops, looking over at Anazider. There is a moment where she watches the Faleen Prince, before she slides up next to him and says quietly, "Destroy that black box, or I won't let you on the ship when we find one. I believe Thandrim and Alishai will back me on up that, " she says, looking to Thandrim, then Alishai in turn, before looking back at Anazider. "I don't know what that thing is… but I do not want it anywhere near me. Ever. Again."
That said, Kali moves amoungst the group to fall in with Garic, or right behind him, whichever is easier to do.

'I think it could easily be left until later, but fine - do it now so long as it's done quickly.' Alishai says. As she does her shoulders lift in a shrug, the box she carries rising then dropping.
'I have a feeling we're running out of time.'
She continues to move in the direction of the hangars without waiting for resolution of the issue, the box held to her chest like a shield since with it in her hands she is incapable of wielding her pistol.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2008-01-17 21:51:22)

Anazider quirks an eyebrow at Kalaria before erupting in sardonic mirth, his stride never faltering for a moment as he follows after Alishai.
"Ah... From tossing things at me like I were a common servant to commanding me, and even issuing threats. You must not think very highly of me, miss Sein." The prince shakes his head sadly as he continues walking, scanning their approach for any sign of further ambush.
"Can you tell me why Blotus is after this box? Or what it is, or how it came to share the same asteroid as the rest of us, and lay hidden for so long without notice? Perhaps you could also then share how the Hutt knew there was a *Jedi* amongst us," He says the word sourly, as if acquiring its taste and finding it lacking, "when Thandrim has kept it *so* well hidden from everyone for so long? Because if you can't, I would wager that the answers could be found with this mystery box, and I'll not destroy it before gaining such knowledge."
Anazider checks his datapad for any change in the situation in the lower hangars, all the while speaking over his shoulder.
"Now, can we please save the unnecessary conflict for when our lives are no longer in jeopardy?"

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2008-01-18 11:47:08)

Kali looks at Anazider, looks around, then pulls out her blaster pistol and levels it at the Faleen with shaking hands. "No… you… you don't understand, Anazider. Get rid of it now. I mean it, " she says, her voice trembling faintly as well. Licking her lips, Kali watches Anazider. "It's changing you, like .. like it did that Rodian. I… get rid of it, Anazider. Get rid of it now! " is commanded again, even as Kalaria takes an unconscious step backwards.
Violet eyes dart to the pouch at the man's side, as if they could peer at the box resting inside as well. "Blotus didn't know until Thandrim pulled out his lightsaber to save Alishai and I. And it's not Blotus pulling the strings! There is something really WRONG here! You didn't hear him in your head! You didn't feel the cold… the sheer EVIL coming from that box! " pleads Kali, her grip shifting even more tightly on the blaster. "I don't want to hurt you, but you drop that box right now, or I'll try to shoot it from your hip, and I think I'll miss right now. Anazider… drop it, back away. Get rid of it! You're going to end up like that first Rodian, you've got to! You've got to get rid of it now. It's evil! Listen to me! For once in your life you self-important, arrogant, pompus gundark, listen to me!"

As Kali speaks, Alishai stops, and begins to shudder. She drops her box; it hits the metal flooring with a loud but thankfully dull clank.
'Listen to her Anazider.' She quietly insists, turning worried eyes on the Falleen. 'Even if you resist it, that box is still our doom. The forces that want to possess it will follow it to the ends of the Galaxy. We will have no respite, no matter how far or fast we run.'

### **Thandrim** (2008-01-18 14:22:45)

Well this, the young Jedi never really trained for. Twice he is interupted as first Kali and then Ali speak out in support of getting seperation from the dark box in Anazider's possession. Why exactly Alishai needed just that moment to drop her own box... With a glance at Garic to see if he too is going to add voice, Thandrim decides finally to speak. He needs to do something quickly if they are to avoid friendly fire it seems.
First he looks at Kali with a level gaze and a steady if quiet voice. "That is enough Kalaria. Put the weapon down." The young Jedi silent reminds himself not to allow his fellow teen to lead negotiations in the future. Next the youth turns to look the at noble Falleen directly, causing hair to drift around his eyes as so commonly occurs with the youth. Hair which is lightly brushed back and away as were the group just chatting in the hallway on a normal day, when nothing is wrong at all. "Your desire for answers and knowledge is admirable, Anazider. Some of those answers can be provided I think. That box, and the ship it was in remained hidden because we had not dug deep enough into this asteroid to find it. As for the rest, I can only offer you general information. Something in that container has slept, for a very very long time. But when Melli and Vyn found that ship, it started to wake up. I am certain Blotus came here originally just to collect his ore and leave as he always does. But something more is happening now. He, and we are caught up in it." With a slow sigh, the young human takes a step closer to Anazider. "The rest are mysteries, but you know well that sometimes a question is best left unanswered. The sooner the box and it's contents are destroyed, the safer we will be. Every moment you hold onto it endangers not only you, but all of us. And not merely because an entire ship full of miscreants want us dead. You must trust me, in the fullness of it all they are the least of our worries."

Anazider[2:49 PM]: "Trust you, huh? You've been endangering all of us for years without our knowing, and you want me to trust you. You don't understand -NONE of you understand- what we can do with this."
Anazider[2:01 PM]: ((*this box))
scribed[2:41 PM]: 'You think you do?' Alishai responds quietly. It isn't aggressive, nor accusatory. Simply a query.
Anazider glances at Alishai, keeping the blaster aimed directly at Thandrim's chest.
chibiamy trembles faintly, her eyes flicking to Anazider, to Alishai, to Thandrim, something wild in them. She does lower her blaster, for the moment, as she glances around. "I can see what it is doing to you... to all of you. Look at us," she hisses before suddenly lunging forward and diving in an attempt to snare the box away from Anazider, then keep on running.
Anazider[2:45 PM]: "I KNOW I do. Each of you is allowing your fears and desires drive you. The worth of this vessel could be immeasurable."

thandrim[2:13 PM]: "No Anazider, there is no profit to be ha--" Thandrim's words are cut off as Kali makes her diving strike. This is not going to go well. The youth tenses for the fight that is sure to erupt.
Anazider 's narrow to blue slits as the girl makes a leap at him. He sidesteps the clumsy attempt and levels his blaster on Kalaria's back. "Anyone else move, and I will shoot her. If you," he nods in Thandrim's direction, "try anything, visible or not, I will be sure you regret it. Now everyone stay still!"
Anazider[2:05 PM]: ((Intimidation on Thandrim +14))
scribed[2:41 PM]: 'Kali, do NOT move again.' Alishai insists, eyes on Anazider narrowing. 'I admit to not knowing you as well as I would like right now Anazider, but I don't think you have it in you to kill her over a mere object. Despite your fortune I believe you to understand the basic concept that life is worth more than wealth.'
chibiamy trembles, she continues to tremble, but her fear is not over the blaster to her back. Her free-hand reaches up to her head and Kalaria shakes it very slowly. "This is wrong. I must make you stop. Make you stop," she says, her voice thickening with raw emotion before her mind lashes out with, >
scribed[2:37 PM]: 'He is right Kali. You're letting the Dark Side control you. As is Anazider. You're both on the brink.'
Anazider takes the sack holding the box in his freehand, switching the selector on his pistol from stun to kill. The normal jade hue of his complexion begins to shift towards crimson as his anger rises unbidden.
Anazider[3:50 PM]: "I do not wish to harm her, but I will *not* be assaulted, nor will I be *forced* to do anything."
scribed[3:44 PM]: 'Who's forcing you?' Alishai retorts. 'LISTEN to yourself, Anazider. You're no longer in control of your actions!'
thandrim sighs quietly. "But you /are/ being forced Anazider. That box is controlling you as surely as Miss Kantriel controls her puppets for the children's amusement." The young human gives Kalaria a short look, one touched with sympathy? Then it is back to Anazider. "There is no profit there, no power for you. Be rid of it, be /free/ of it through it's destruction. I am /asking/ you to do this."
Anazider shakes his against the flood of painful memories seeking to overwhelm him. "This is more of the same. Even though I've worked and sweated and bled with you all for several years, there is still the doubt. The lies. The isolation. Just like home. No more!"
Anazider bites his lip near to bleeding, Kalaria's telepathic scream warring with the other voices and the continual flood of memories. The outrage of the intrusion joins the myriad of other emotions, drowning out rational thought and causing him to pull the trigger.
Tru[5:06 PM]: Kali falls to the floor in a slump, unconscious not dead.

thandrim[3:38 PM]: Even as the sound of the blaster resounds in the hallway, Thandrim dives not for Kalaria, but for Anazider himself. In an effort to grapple and wrestle the mad alien to the ground, if only to buy time.
Tru[5:08 PM]: The young jedi leaps at the noble only to get pushed aside into Kali
Tru[5:38 PM]: Anaziders shoot is high, distracted by Thandrims tackle the shoot goes high and knocks out a light in the hallway
Anazider releases a hiss of frustration as the youth causes his shot to go wide. He spins away from the tackle, looking at the group of humans as they band together, sneering in disgust. He takes off away from the group at a dead run.
thandrim[4:54 PM]: Shaking his head after the rather unsuccessful attempt to tackle and pin Anazider, Thandrim looks up only to see the Falleen attempting to flee. He cannot be allowed to escape of course, so the boy does the only thing he really can at this point. He concentrates.
thandrim[4:48 PM]: Even as he does concentrate, the youth's left hand seeks out Kalaria's shoulder and gives it a squeeze. First thing's first.
Tru[6:10 PM]: The nobel begins to takes flight then with Thandrims actions lifts off the floor to the ceiling spinning to face away from the group
scribed[4:41 PM]: Somewhat surprised that she didn't get hit, Alishai is startled as Anazider rushes off. She is already pulling her pistol from its holster when the Falleen floats off the floor. She nods to Thandrim and rushes to the noble, attempting to wrest the bag which contains the offending box away from him.
chibiamy[4:56 PM]: As her shoulder is squeezed, Kalaria moans, being roused to consciousness. Then the young woman's eyes burst open with frightful speed and she sits up near instantly, her hands going to her head and pulling away, leaving a surprised expression when Kalaria sees nothing standing her fingers. Frantically, the young woman looks around, confused, scared, worried, and at last... relieved as she takes a moment to count everyone and not that they are, indeed, still breathing. And then... Kalaria whimpers. She slowly lifts her hands as she backs away from Thandrim, over her head and begins to curl inwards on herself, sobbing openly.
Anazider begins to fire his blaster in impotent rage as he is taken from his feet by an invisible Force. His face contorts into a snarling rictus as he attempts to maintain a death grip on the sack, firing the blaster all the while.
thandrim looks to be straining somewhat, though with one hand partly held out, it is clear he is keeping Anazider from fleeing. That strain is echoed in his voice as he speaks. "Knock him out first. You.. must." Just yet he cannot give Kalaria quite the time she deserves, only able to manage a quiet, "It's okay."
Tru[6:23 PM]: Anazider begins to aim his blaster but Alishai jumps to grab the sack. With more strength then the noble would have though Alishai fights hard for the sack. With a quick thrust Alishai pulls the sack free of Anaziders grasp.
scribed[4:58 PM]: Alishai throws the bag back down the corridor to Thandrim and Kali. 'Destroy it!' She says, even as she places her blaster right up against the floating Falleen - somewhere he REALLY doesn't want to be shot. 'And you, drop your gun NOW.'
Anazider lets loose a guttural roar, which quickly fades into a gasping sob. He struggles to breath, while making sense of his current position. "Put me down! What is going on here! This is an outrage!"
chibiamy[4:15 PM]: Kalaria is ... gone. She is awake, but she is also sobbing, trying to curl up and hide. As the sack is tossed closer, it's as if Kali can feel it, and hse starts shivering more, trying to scoot away from it, frightened of it.
Tru[6:38 PM]: Garic who up until now had not known what to do or how to resolve the situation puts a hand up to both Alisha and Anazider. "Hold friends I don`t think this is right, none of this makes any sense."
thandrim[4:49 PM]: With a steady breath as the ominous sack thuds and slides towards him, Thandrim replies distractedly to Garic. "No, but it will soon." The youth's free hand then retrieves his lightsaber from it's hiding place, and a flick of the thumb ignites the weapon as he looks to the sack. All the while still keeping Anazider held in place. For now.
scribed[4:51 PM]: 'Garic! Kali! One of you get the box out of that bag!' Alishai insists. It seems that no matter how urgently she wants the box destroyed, she'd rather not destroy all of Anazider's possessions along with it.
scribed[4:21 PM]: Oh, and she switches her pistol to stun. Just in case she's forced to fire...
chibiamy[4:20 PM]: Kali starts to look up as Alishai says her name. And just as the young woman's gaze meets the older woman's, Kali groans and squeezes her eyes shut again, covering her head with her hands. "Make it stop! Make it be quiet! Make it stop!" she whimpers again before returning to her sobs.
Anazider scrubs away tears with the back of his hand, struggling with the effort as well as against whatever's holding him. "Will someone get me down and tell me what, in the name of bloody hell is going on!"
Tru[6:00 PM]: down the hall the lights of the two lights indicate that the lifts are powered again, and being used
scribed[4:22 PM]: 'For the love of!' Alishai hisses. 'Thandrim, put him down. Get that box destroyed. And let's get out of here!'
scribed[4:00 PM]: She stands ready to catch the Falleen and lower him to alleviate Thandrim some of the necessities of the task.
thandrim[4:20 PM]: The woman might well not have spoken at all. For as Alishai gets out the word 'For' the power that holds Anazider up is released. Thandrim takes a two handed grip upon his lightsaber with a face that shows a lot more determination that it should for a young man about to attack a helpless sack. And with one fluid motion he pushes the weapon forward to the box, intent on burning right through the thing. Fast.
Tru[6:07 PM]: the nobel falls. The jedi swings. Alishai softens Anaziders fall, as the light saber hits the sack the light leather melts away in a hiss. The light saber disengages completely when it hits the box.
scribed[4:01 PM]: Seeing it happen, Alishai yells 'Garic, shoot it!' as she lets go of Anazider and retrieves her own box from its place on the corridor floor.
scribed[4:01 PM]: Seeing it happen, Alishai yells 'Garic, shoot it!' as she lets go of Anazider and retrieves her own box from its place on the corridor floor.
Tru[6:47 PM]: Not sure what to do Garic takes a shaky aim at the box and fires his shoot merely puts a carbon score on the box.
Tru[6:13 PM]: As your group ponders the box the first lift door begins to open
thandrim frowns darkly as his weapon not only fails to penetrate in the stabbing motion, but is suddenly completely dead! Seeing the blaster shot also do little the Jedi frowns. "I doubt you will fare so well in the depths of a star.." Then as the doors behind begin to open, Thandrim slips his weapon back into hiding and moves to pick up the cursed box before heading down the hallway. "Time to go!"

Garic still a bit dumbfounded at the events he has just witnessed rushes over to Kali. He attempts to help her to her feet, letting her use him for total support and if needed he will carry her. His eye dart about like a child whose afraid of the dark, his every nerve tingling. "I might not be sure what THAT is." He hisses under his breath. "But Ill be damned if it hurts my friends."

"Carry her if you have to Garic, just don't leave her behind." Thandrim's voice rings with worry for the girl as he makes down the hallway holding the rather resistant box. Passing Anazider he comments quickly, "It was better than you getting your head blown off." Then he continues down the hallway and away from the opening lift doors. With any luck at all they can get around the corner before shots are fired their way.

Kalaria is unresponsive at first, it turns out Garic will need to carry her. Which is for the best, the state Kali is in right now, if she was walking it would slow down the group more than Garic carrying her. However, at Thandrim's words and Garic lifting her up, Kalaria just wraps her arms around the Zabrak and begins crying into his shoulder anew.
Whatever happened, it wasn't pleasant.

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-22 06:35:39)

Just as your group begins its retreat the lift doors open to one of the lifts. Two individuals in mid conversation stop when they see you looks of disbelief on there faces. Both are dressed in the light blue uniforms with a red strip down the left arm, representing ship crew and both are know to you all.
The first to step out of the lift is Lt Aries Soome a middle aged woman with short dark hair she is known for her ridged interpretation of the ships rules and guide lines. The other is Tryd Nye a volunteer to the stations security team, an attractive young man with messy blond hair it is rumored that Tryd only joined the security team to get out of the mine work.
Tryd steps out and looks to Lt Soome for direction.
Still surprised by your groups presents here one the personal level Lt Soome speaks out. "Alishai Anazider what are you doing up here the whole ship is looking for you, our own people are confined and under guard. Blotus wants you bad." She looks back to the other lift which is still active. "We are on patrol with some of his men you have to get out of here and fast."
Tryd snickers and looks back to the second lift. "If they ever figure out how to use the thing that is."
Lt Soome only response is a cold look down to the shorter Tryd who in response turns a shade of red for speaking out of turn.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2008-01-23 10:33:27)

Anazider looks from Lieutenant Soome to Tryd then back, completely discarding the shorter man as inconsequential. Assuming a less apprehensive posture, the prince still doesn't holster his sporting blaster.
"I dare say we are well aware just how desperately the Hutt seeks us, but I just could not leave without my favorite traveling coat." Anazider smooths out some of the wrinkles in the surcoat that are more than likely to have appeared after his recent *introduction* to the Force.
"But yes, we intend to leave with all due haste, miss Soome. I believe we have transport awaiting us in the lower hangar bay, but require a quick means of reaching there. What can you tell us?" The Falleen nobleman gazes upon the pair with piercing blue eyes, attempting to discern if they are under any sort of compulsion or anxiety.
((Perception on the two to see if they are being influenced, or their emotional state.))

### **simplyscribed** (2008-01-23 13:58:16)

Alishai gives a professional nod to Lieutenant Soome, incorporating a subtle eye roll in the direction of Tryd, who she has always believed to be lazy and somewhat incompetent. She allows Anazider to do the speaking, somewhat surprised that he has already recovered his cool demeanor in the face of his recent exposure to the Force.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Thandrim** (2008-01-27 18:52:01)

Thandrim, be it foolish or not breathes a sigh of relief when the uniformed pair step out of the lift alone. Far less likely that they would need to fight, or even kill these two now. The dark box feels heavy in the youth's hands, and it leaves him with a predicament. He wants to turn away enough to hide the clear evidence of the wound on his chest. He wants to turn enough to hide the box from Tryd and Lt. Somme's view. He wants to hide that same box from Kalaria's view too though. Managing it all and still looking relatively innocent is not exactly an easy task. Closer perhaps to impossible. At least the security woman does not know him too well thanks to relatively little personal contact with her. Not that the contact he'd had was great. The 'Dustbomb' and that 'Bucket' incident were somewhat disapproved of after all.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-29 08:48:55)

At Anaziders mention of a transport waiting Lieutenant Soome raises an eyebrow, "I was not made aware of any current departures I ...." Lieutenant Soome`s is cut off by the chime of the other lift which will be here in seconds.
Lieutenant Soome looks at Alishai "get your people out of here you are wanted dead or alive now run thatâ€™s an order!" Lieutenant Soome reaches into here pocket to produce a data pad which she throws at Anazider "this will get you past the security passes on the doors, at least for a short time. I will try to distracte them as long as I can."
Following orders your group races down the hall to an alternate exit in the back ground you hear the grunting Gamorreans enter the corridor followed by Lieutenant Soome`s yelling "Why you are so useless, Tryd this is the last time I! .... â€œthe commotion continues even after you enter the stairs.

"...I do hope that one day the Human species will collectively learn to *hand* things to people, instead of wantonly *tossing* them. Such rudeness."
Anazider remarks caustically as he slinks away from the lieutenant with the rest of the group. Tapping the barrel of his blaster against his chin, he reviews the new datapad with a furrowed brow.
"But still, Madame Soome has done very well. I'll be sure to reward her accordingly, should she survive this little episode."

### **Thandrim** (2008-01-31 15:02:09)

Moving again and with another fortunate slip by the goons sent to kill them, Thandrim still looks as serious as the situation certainly warrants. Holding that dark box as one might hold a spine-snake, he still attempts to keep himself between it and the others. As though blocking line of sight to the thing would help anything. "Would it were so easy to do." The youth comments upon the heels of Alishai's own words. A cautious look is given back to Garic and the cargo he carries, the still inconsolable Kalaria. A darker frown takes to his features for moment before he looks back forward. Nothing he can do there, yet.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2008-02-01 08:34:57)

True to her words most of the doors are security locked which must have been ordered from the bridge, a quick pass of the data pad over the control panels gets you through several doors within the personal quarters section of the station. Now within a few decks of the lower hanger Anazider checks his own data pad for any changes, it still flashes green over the destination hanger.
Still unresponsive Kali hangs over Garics shoulder, no time to worry about her in yet another corridor this one with several "upgrades". Tubbing criss-cross the walls mix matched circuitry has been assembled for use as rudimentary control panels the carpets have faded the lighting flickers sporadically this section betrays the overall shape of the station. When Anazider passes the data pad over the control panel as he had done several times before the panel itself is unresponsive the door fail to open. Down the corridor you hear several bulkheads sealing the exits behind you. Above you metal on metal cranking and scraping begins, the bulkhead above the door is about to close sealing you all.

### **chibiamy** (2008-02-01 18:42:26)

Kali isn't unconscious, per se. She is deeply traumatized and trying to hide from everything, however. But, with Garic's whispered words, the young woman looks up, looks around, and pulls out her datapad and starts thumbing over it. Maybe luck will be on their side.

### **Thandrim** (2008-02-01 21:28:21)

Though he really should, Thandrim does not appear to be surprised by the lowering bulkheads at all. His most pointed reaction being a sad sigh and drooping of the shoulders. However as Kalaria becomes a little more of herself and diving into her true calling, he looks her way with a still sad smile. "Give a little work to be done..." Spoken as though reciting some old advice from someone else who is surely long dead now. Then those eyes are back to the bulkheads, frowning again.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **Anazider** (2008-02-02 18:22:50)

Anazider eyes the sealing bulkheads, a bitter smirk creeping over his lips.
"...Clever. You've selected an excellent time to become coherent again, otherwise we are soon to be neatly gift wrapped." Frowning slightly at Kalaria, the prince looks to the ventilation ducts in the corridor and the bulkheads behind the group for any sign of nastier surprises.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-02-02 20:07:30)

'Nice choice of words Anazider.' Alishai complains, looking along the corridor at the closed blast door behind them then back at the one in front struggling slowly against some fault or blockage. 'I don't feel like becoming any kind of gift a Hutt appreciates. Remember what happened to Solo?'

---

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2008-02-04 07:34:28)

As if to answer the fears of your group a shower of sparks erupts down the corridor behind you. Someone is using a torch to cut their way into your section.
Kali shakes her head pulls out a few choice items from her pack and furiously begins to work her magic. Her work is followed by a series of beeps and chimes her pace is almost too rapid to follow.
The grinding of the bulkheads stops with a clunk to be replaced by a continuous metallic clicking sound. The doors protest as they are forced open by the set of commands given through Kali`s data pad, against the security lock down the door opens. Given the time frame available the task of opening the door before the bulkhead dropped was nothing short of a miracle or luck.

### **Thandrim** (2008-02-05 10:49:37)

With a quiet inward smile, Thandrim wastes no time getting through the newly opened doorway. With presumed enemies already trying to cut their way in, there can be little time to daudle.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **chibiamy** (2008-02-05 11:25:18)

Finally Kali lets her hand holding the datapad drop, leaning heavily against Garic. The young woman's eyes flick over to Alishai at the comment, not managing to muster much enthusiasm or gratitude alas. But then her eyes drift towards Anazider, and then narrow. Purposefully Kalaria directs her thoughts at the noble Faleen, intending to yell 'Shut Up!' in annoyance.
But that is not what manages to come from her mind. Instead, the sound of metal grating against metal, the sort of squeal that rattles one teeth sounds in the background, before an inaudible scream, that could or could not be a string of explicatives barely registers over the grating sound.
Wincing herself, Kali seems to draw even further inwards, closing her eyes firmly as she clings to Garic, since he is the one holding her right now. "Just slowed them... the bulkheads," she says softly, perhaps not even heard by others. "Can't stop 'em, just slowed 'em."
((OOC: Tru knows what I'm doing! Telepathy Bay-Bee! Sorry, Anazider... alas, Kali is frayed and annoyed at Anazider's noble mein. The problem being, she tried to get words out, and didn't manage, scarred as she is from her incident.))

### **Anazider** (2008-02-06 15:44:38)

Anazider quirks an eyebrow at Kalaria as the bulkhead's closure comes to a grinding halt. He grunts slightly to himself as Alishai ushers the group through the doorway. He ignores the slight nettling he feels between his eyes, this doing nothing to improve his mood
"I suppose its rather obvious that lieutenant Soome's datapad is now useless, but we've not much further to go. Quickly, now!"

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2008-02-07 12:07:45)

Your group breaths a sigh of relief having exited an obvious trap. The sound of the bulkheads crashing down breaking the short respite you had. Safe for now your group continues towards the hanger bay. It only takes a few moments to reach the hanger bay.
Inside spare parts scrap dura steel lay scattered about the floor. The Biddy Crate a Mon Calamari MC18 light freighter sits in the middle of the hanger bay. The ship still has a smooth stream lined surface despite the recent smoldering carbon marks about the hull. The landing gear itself looks as though it may buckle at anytime having taking a few too many hits on the ventral side of the ship.
The hanger bay itself is a dull grey with yellow hazard lining at the hanger exit which currently has the shields on open space. Asteroids pass by and a few maintenance vehicles can be seen. The right side of the hanger about half way down the 80m length is a door and large control room window. The engines of the Biddy Crate are on there is someone in the cockpit and a woman on the ground yelling up to the cockpit.

Thandrim allows the others to take a lead over him. "With any luck they will be more than happy with the idea of getting clear." And hopefully that /is/ Lacy there, it's her ship after all. Though he spends perhaps a touch too much time straining to get a look at the woman in front of the ship just for that reason. The rest of that time is spent keeping a little distance ahead of Garic and his cargo of Kalaria, glancing back often.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2008-02-12 17:58:17)

On Alishai`s approach Lacy turns and begins a verbal assault on your group. A human woman with auburn hair, trailing down from the back of her head in a long 'tail' wound up with cords of golden material. There are a few decorated streaks of blue through the locks, but they are dark, nothing that would glow in the right light. Tanned skin is pulled over muscled flesh on this woman, her bright violet eyes coming at a faint slant and giving an exotic look to this otherwise typical human female.
"Who are you to commandeer my ship?"
"Why canâ€™t I reach the bridge?"
"Who is sending orders to release my ship, My Ship to you?"
"Just what is going on here anyway?"
Lacy continues to barrage you without giving any kind of opportunity to respond she is obviously upset. From the Biddy Crate a woman waves you recognize as Tinian, she had made it to the hanger and has a ship ready to go.
Lacy still upset waving her hands in the air suddenly stops her eyes open wide looking past your group to the hanger entry way doors. "Oh snap, you gone a stired a Hutts nest today."
Behind your group four rodians carrying blaster rifles enter followed by several Gamorreans set ready to charge. They all stop just inside the doorway with more behind them. A heavily armed humanoid steps in clad head to toe, no claw in black armor. The individual carries many weapons various blasters blades grenades etc....
With the new arrival Lacy curses under her breath "Sith spit thatâ€™s Kursk you have gotten a bounty on your head." She lowers her voice "Run you fools take my ship get out now." Lacy runs to the control room off to the side.

"I would suggest you attempt to make your way back *to* the ship before take off. This... *Kursk*, as you call him, doesn't seem like the understanding sort."
With that, Anazider boards the Biddy Crate with all due haste. He negotiates his way through the various corridors and portals of the freighter until he arrives in the cockpit.
"Hello again miss Lar. I hope the time since are last parting didn't tax you too heavily, for I fear things are about to get a bit more... *strenuous*, yes?"
The prince offers the woman a roguish smile before hopping into the copilot seat, his fingers quickly gaining a familiarity with the controls of the Mon Calamarian vessel.

Alishai follows Anazider through the ship, but makes her way to a gun emplacement instead of to the cockpit. Stashing her box nearby where she can keep an eye on it, the soon to be ex-security guard straps herself in and familiarises herself with the controls.

Sitting down beside Tinian who merely nods at Anazider "I have run a systems check on the ship it does not look good." As if to emphasis her statement several shoots hit the side of the ship the Hutts thugs have begun to fire on the Biddy Crate.
The systems check shows:
-Computer core: checking ...... functional
-Communication: online
-Sensors: checking.... checking ... functional
-Life Support: checking..... Error ...... recheck ...... (Tinian kicks this control panel) functional

-Shields: checking.... currently 50% capacity
-Landing struts: checking.... error repulsor generator offline ... landing struts unresponsive.
-Hull: 40% damage to outer hull, 60% efficiency.
A quick check of the nav computer shows the last visited coordinates still logged in a place called Sarlacc Station. Several more shoots hit the side of the ship looking out the windows of the Biddy Crate Gammorreans circle the ship cutting off any possible exit. Lacyâ€™s voice comes over the comm you can see her wide hand movements inside the control room "Shoot back or something, thatâ€™s my ship donâ€™t let them!" she is cut off when Tinian flick off the comm.
Alishai waits patently while the top side cannon powers up, it takes a few moments longer then it should indicting a power fluctuation somewhere in the ship. From Alishais vantage point she can see several Rodians setting up a tripod cannon it will be operational within a few short moments.

Having raced up the boarding ramp and into the ship, Thandrim has busied himself with simply getting inside to a secure location behind the cockpit of the small freighter.

Kalaria is easily desposited inside, not a pilot nor a navigator, she isn't needed for this current critical step. The young woman still seems to curl in on herself, pulling out her datapad and turns her back to the 'universe' at large, instead deciding to hide in her own reality, perhaps. The shots to the ship are ignored, though Kalaria is curiously attempting to slice into the ships computers to assess the freighter.
The young woman's eyes scan the illuminated screen of the datapad, her expression almost blank. Without a word, Kalaria stands and walks as quietly through the ship as she can, not trying to draw any attention to herself. After all, she wants to be alone right now. And for Kalaria, alone means working on something. With datapad in one hand and hydrospanner in the other, the young woman searches the list of repairs needed for one that she can work on while the ship is in flight, intending to disappear for a while.

Anazider helps Tinian with the start up process, going over the systems read-out with a disapproving frown.
"Well, it would seem the only thing holding this *crate*," He contemptuously spits the word, the fitting irony of its use not lost on him, "together would be mesh tape and hope. *Cheap* mesh tape."
Shaking his head, Anazider attempts to help get the repulsors up and running as best he can from the cockpit.
"But seeing as how we've made it this far on even less than cheap mesh tape, perhaps we'll make it just a bit further."

The comm comes alive again but this time on your individual comms a frantic Lacy
Begins shouting "They are going to blow you up; Krusk has a bomb he is under the ship get out get out! I will open the atmospheric shield fly out of here now."
Thandrim begins to retune the crystals in his saber and with great precision is able to get it working again, a quick check the saber ignites and functions perfectly.
While Kali scans the damage report Anaziders plea to repair the repulsor lift can be heard, a quick check and Kali notices that several parts must be replaced and would take an hour at best.
Alishai turns the top mounted cannon on the Rodians setting up the cannon. The blast rocks the hanger bay forcing everyone in the ship to grab hold or fall flat. Alishai`s shoot leaves a smoking hole where the cannon was, the Rodians are unrecognizable amongst the sporadic rubble.
Tinian smiles at Anaziders remark she begins to power up the engines the Biddy Crate begins to slowly move sparks can be seen from the cockpit. Anaziders attempt to reactivate the repulsors fails with a flashing offline!

"...Right, dragging and scraping it is. At this rate, we might as well wait for this *Krusk* fellow to give us a boost out of here."
Anazider sourly grumbles as the Biddy Crate stutters and skips its way out of the hanger. He flips the ships internal comm system on while priming the engines, preparing to take them to full throttle once the atmospheric shield was down.
"I would suggest everyone strap themselves in. If we don't explode outright, I think we'll be in for a rather *turbulent* voyage."

A quick and small smile is given from Thandrim's lips as he gets his weapon working again. Not that he has great use for it just at that moment. The youth is left with attempting now to strap himself into a seat with that black box under foot.

Kalaria is in her own world. Whether or not she can get the landing gear working in time for takeoff from the Last Hope, she works anyway, it is her own little way of coping. And so long as she is working, she doesn't think about her anger, her fear, all those emotions which leave her frightened and cold and lashing out blindly.
Now, this may mean that Kalaria is about to get hurt, but she is oblivious to the danger.

The Biddy Crate protests its forced exit of the hanger bay with creaks, moans and a shower of sparks the blaster fire from the tugs does not help at all. Tinian and Anazider work hard to keep the ship heading toward the exit while Alishai fires another shoot at a group of Gamorreans. The shoot shakes the entire hanger bay again, through the smoke and debris itâ€™s hard to tell how many where hit.
The hanger doors close sealing everyone off from the rest of the ship. Lacy shouts over the comm. â€œI hope your all ready, here goes nothing ... take care of my ship I will be looking to get her back." Her voice seems broken as though she was losing a close friend.
The atmospheric shields drop suddenly forcing the emergency hanger bay doors to close, but the sudden drop in atmosphere takes it toll. Debris, containers, Gammoreans, Rodians alike all rush out to space. Tinian hits the throttle to full sub light speed with loud thump the landing gear hits the outer lip of the hanger bay and the Biddy Crate is out.
The sensors quickly scan the area both a blessing that they work and a curse that they have found another ship. "Scutta it Blotuses ship I am going to have to punch it to hyper drive." Tinian swears they looks over to Anazider "When I give you the word punch up the hyper drive no time to make calculations we will have to use the last set in the nav computer."
Blotuses ship comes into view of unknown manufacture, it has been rumored that he had the builder killed so that no one else would have the same ship. The ship is large and despite the grafted turbo lasers still beautiful. It resembles a series of full sweeping sails. Its tans hull is well kept polished and though it looks slow she moves through space with grace.
The Biddy Crate with Tinian at the helm takes a series of dives and rolls as green bolts of energy erupt form the capital ship Hutts Pride (Blotuses ship). "Hit it hit it now Anazider!" With the hyper drive engines hot Anazider punches in the last set of hyper drive coordinates used by the Biddy Crate a place known as Sarlacc Station.
The stars blur as green turbo blasts streak over the dorsel side of the ship.

As the *Biddy Crate* punches out into hyperspace, Alishai slumps in her gunner's seat, relieved. After a moment's allowance of relaxation, she unstraps herself from the chair and makes her way back to the cockpit.
'Good flying Tinian.' She commends, searching out her box of possessions. 'So now we have some time on our hands, what passes for quarters on this ship anyway?'

Anazider makes sure that the autopilot is properly engaged, before neatly stacks four five-hundred mark credit chits on the console, sliding them until they rest in front of Tinian. He dusts his hands, rising from the copilots seat with a languid stretch.
"As promised, another two thousand credits. Certainly well earned, I must say. If you find yourself in need of future employment, be sure to look me up."
The prince brushes past Alishai without comment or even a glance as he makes his way to the freighter's common living area. Once there, he looks around for the ship's general access computer, intent on pulling up information on Sarlacc Station.

Seeing all is fine Garic wonders to one of the cargo bays of the ship. Slumping down against the wall thoughts race through his mind, too many thoughts. What was all that? What just happened? What will .... can we do now? Looking down at his blaster recent events come crashing down on him. Garic drops the blaster and buries his head in his hands "What have we done?" Said aloud to no one but himself.

Alishai find all her belongings and two separate cabins. Though sparsely furnished and only a set of bunks to sleep on they will do fine. In the rear of the ship a pull out bunk is found in the engine room and the common room table serves as a back up bunk.
Tinian cracks her knuckles and takes two stacks of credit chips "I like that so few keep their word these days. I will give you a discount if you ensure I get back home after we repair."
Anazider begins to pull up what little information the ships computer has on Sarlacc Station:
Sarlacc Station (AKA the Pit)
Outer rim territories Kash system
Station Administrator: Grumbo
Station Head of Security: Miat Nassin (The Void Vipers)
Permanent local business:
-Credits worth gambling casino owned by Veen Hill
-The Crusty Mynock (Grumbos) local cantina owned and operated by Grumbo
-Star Scap Local cantina owned by Xoran
-Vash Industry`s owned by Serian Vash
-Sarlacc Station hosts a number of visiting merchants and vender's these numbers constantly vary. Weekly pit fights are also held within the station the current champion is Carrsserk.
Tinian looks at the read out Anazider accessed "I am surprised we had this much info on the Pit its an off the cart off the grid hole." She cracks her neck s she reads further "Oh thats interesting ..... I have bad news and worst news. The bad news is we have to make our visit short ... guess that's good news too. Vash industry`s should have all the parts we need. The worst news is that Grumbo aka Grumbo the Hutt is Blotus`s cousin if he is the station administrator its only because Blotus owns the station."
Thinking things could not get any worse the ship jolts and quickly recovers. "I was afraid of that, the back up hyper drive will get us there but it will take longer." With that Tinian puts her feet on the console and relaxes.
(everyone who has taken damage has enough time to get all hit points back through rest and treat injury)

Kalaria is hiding, honestly. Hiding away from the past few hours. Or has it just been one hour? It's so terribly hard to tell. The young woman, since boarding the Biddy Crate, has found a place within the bowels of the ship which need repair work.
Having moved aside a metal plating, Kalaria has climbed down into a pit near the landing gear. With hydrospanner in hand, the young woman sits on a shielded conduit and stares at the wires and electronics and hydraulics in front of her. The spanner itself is flipped end over end over end in her hand absently as her mind tries not to wander, and fails, to recent events.
Hide and seek was always a fun game for Thandrim as a small child, and in a measured way still is today. One of the last childish things one holds onto tightly lest giving it away make him 'old.' He had always been good at it, even before entering his training, and that training only got him better at the game.
Having stashed the black box away where he figures nobody will find it, and hoping that nobody will look for it yet, Thandrim has begun to play the game, seeking out Kalaria. Not as easy as it should have been perhaps, but he does find himself slipping into the inner-belly of the vessel's maintenance areas. Tight but giving enough room to work, barely. Unhindered by equipment hitting the conduits, plates or cowlings his approach toward where Kalaria is working is relatively silent. Something he is not completely unhappy about, wanting to take just a moment to watch her.
Kalaria is not in the mindset to be very observant right now. Honestly, Kali is not in the mindset for much of anything as she continues to stare at the various bits and pieces in front of her. Finally the young woman reaches up, and wipes at her face with a grease-stained hand, before she slips off her perch and kneels, leaning forward as she twists her head away from Thandrim to extend her reach in an attempt to adjust something that should probably be easy for a tall man with longer arms.
Instead, Kalaria struggles and stretches, growling at the strain and frustration until she reaches what she wants. Her arms twist, as does her body to provide the right leverage and with a sigh, Kali falls backwards. Now wiping at her brow with the back of her arm, a sigh is let out as the young woman lifts the spanner and peers at it a moment. Then she looks at her grease-stained empty hand as she lifts it up next to the one gripping the tool. One can almost hear the thought 'Just what are you now, Kali' as she observes the differences between empty and full hand.
"You need any help with that?" Thandrim exposes his presence with the softly spoken words even as he pulls himself forward into this somewhat roomier section of the hull. Better than the crawlspace he just left anyway. The boy does not enter very far, but enough to get beyond the little tunnel openin to allow him to crouch there looking at his fellow teenager. "As cramped as it is in here, it's amazing that anything could be out of reach." An attempt at humor, mild though it may be.
Startled, Kalaria is! Blinking, the young woman drops the spanner then bobbles and fumbles with it trying to catch the precious tool before it falls to the metal plating that works as a floor in this space. At least she didn't scream, in this crapped area such a noise could prove to be deafening. Then the young woman's eyes dart over to Thandrim and Kali is obviously a mix of relieved, confused, frightened and angry all at once, the emotions dancing and playing across her face.
So Kalaria falls back on an old standard. Gripping the spanner tightly in her hand, she glares at Thandrim a moment before suddenly looking away only to grumble over her shoulder. "Are you calling me short?"
Working hard to avoid a huge grin at seeing his companion surprised and the resulting acrobatics to catch her tool, Thandrim ends up giving us a smile instead. "Sorry" He comments though it is clear he isn't really sorry, still too amused. Then at last he stands up in the space, taking the moment to stretch out a little while he can here. "It's not a crime you know. . . . being short."
"Yeah, yeah. You say that like you almost mean it," drawls Kalaria glancing at the spanner, before suddenly rooting around for something to pretend to fix, "Oh ye of great height." Kalaria busies herself silently for several heartbeats, until she grows uncomfortable with the fact that Thandrim is standing, stretching over her. So she suddenly stands up and spins around, waggling the spanner at him as she regards him warily, "Whatcha want?"
In mid-stretch, Kali's sudden turn and questioning appears to catch Thandrim off guard. Freezing with his arms still up, his eyes widen a little as he looks down at the teenage girl and blinks a couple of times. Then the boy recovers himself and eyes return to a more serene look as arms lower to his sides. "Wrong question. I think the real question you are looking for you already stated back home. 'What are you?" The young Jedi gives a little shrug of his shoulders. "And by extension, what are /you/?" He looks more directly at the human girl with the last.
Oh, that most certainly makes Kali uncomfortable! How DARE he have such insight into her! Cheeks color with both embarrassment and anger as Kalaria shifts her jaw from one side to the other. "Don't you ever FEEL anything besides ... smug?" she asks with a grumble before turning around again. "And the question still stands. What do you want? Why are you down here? And ... yeah... what ARE you? And what ... am ... I..." murmurs the young woman, looking at the metal floor as her words trail off to end in a whisper.
Smiling a little more if somewhat softer, Thandrim shifts to lean himself back against the bulkhead and crossing his arms before him. "Smugness would require pride." A short sigh later he continues. "That is a lot of questions, fitting I guess that I'm answering them amidst a mess of wires, pumps, pipes and conduit. Because the questions have nothing to do with any of it." The youth shifts again, frowning with eyes darting down before he assumes a more level look and returns his gaze to Kali. "I want to talk to you, which is why I'm down here. I am Jedi. Well, padawan really. Just a student before... you know. And you . . . . feel the Force even as I do."
The young woman's gaze is sidelong as she looks through her shoulder at Thandrim, before grunting and fiddling uselessly with some wire right in front of her. "Jedi... great," she says before pausing, blinking, stiffening. The Jedi that protected everyone trying to get to the ship, was he...
No, Kalaria wasn't going to ask that. Annoyed, confused as she is, Kalaria isn't completely insensative. "So what? Aren't you like, wanted then? By Krayt? And if I feel the Force like you do, doesn't that mean I'm destined to be one of his Sith Puppets? What do you want from me, Thandrim?"
"Seems to happen to us every once in a while. We keep peace through the galaxy and protect people, and then at some point we are betrayed and almost destroyed before we fight again to establish order and peace once more." Thandrim speaks as his eyes drift away again, that frown touching his lips before he asks another question, still not looking at Kali. "Do /you/ think you are destined to be a puppet of the Sith? To be drowned in the hate and anger that is the Dark side of the Force until you are tossed aside by your Master to die?"
Kalaria's face distorts in anger and hatred, not that Thandrim can see that, but the waves of those emotions that flow off of her are evident. Then suddenly, she shakes her head. "I'll never serve that murderous bastard," whispers Kalaria hoarsely. "I'm just biding my time until I can wring his neck on my own. There, see, lost cause," she notes, though her last four words are more shaky than the young woman intended. Perhaps she is more afraid that she IS a lost cause than anything else.
"Revenge is always a lost cause Kalaria. Justice on the other hand, is not." Thandrim's eyes go back to the young woman now. A turn of the head tossing his hair about some. "You don't have to 'bide your time' anymore. You /cannot/ if anyone else learns that you are strong with the Force. But your anger for Krayt, for what he is and ... for what he has done, is only going to end in your death. Not his. You /can/ fight him, you can even defeat him in time, but not walking the path you would walk here and now."
"What do you know, Thandrim? What do you know of me? Honestly? I'm just some..." starts Kalaria waving her greasy hand around before spinning to face Thandrim. "Look at me! LOOK AT ME! I'm just a kid. I've made gathering information on Krayt my life. I've got skills that only help me get buy. I have dreamed, and breathed, and lived off of the desire to kill Krayt for these past seven years. Maybe, just maybe that's who I am now. Maybe that's ALL I am. All I know. 'Cause everything else that I had, that I was, that I knew... I left back on that station. Now, I'm just... " Kalaria shakes her head, and reaches up to wipe at her eyes with the back of her arm. No, no, she wasn't getting teary-eyed, she wasn't about to cry. Nope! Not Kali! Never Kali!
"You are /free/ Kalaria. You can do more than 'get by' and plan for a revenge that could never happen. You can /live/ now. All of what you were back there no longer matters unless you cling to it." Thandrim's words remain quiet and almost contemplative despite Kali's outbursts. Quietly, smiply, truthfuly spoken and no more.
"I am not free, Thandrim. You are not free! We are all slaves to some force, be it destiny, or history," snaps Kalaria, as she half twists away again. She stands there a moment, breathing with great shuddering inhales and exhales before she lowers her hands to her sides, the spanner just barely held in her grasp. "I don't know what to do anymore."
"You are wrong there Kalaria. Your choices and your life's path are your own to choose. The Force can guide you, but only if you let it, and what you give it determines where it will lead you." Thandrim does not falter in his line of reasoning, at least not yet. "I'm aware of no prophesy surounding you, or me or anyone else for that matter. And history is just the past, it's already happened. It does not control you, and can only influence the future a little." Finally he shifts again, standing instead of leaning. "You don't know what to do, I don't know what you should do. But I would give you an option, if you want it."
"And what option would that be, Thandrim? Be like you? Do you REALLY think the Jedi, wherever they are, want someone like me in their ranks?" asks Kalaria with a bit of a sigh before turning to look direcly back up at Thandrim. "Look around you! I'm a burden to most of this group, and you are the closest things I've had to friends that I can remember. And I don't remember ANYTHING that happened before that day. That's ... that's the worst part, I think. I ... I can't remember anything. It's like my life started on that day, and all I have is the memory of Aloon's destruction."
"The rest of your life is in there." Thandrim points a single finger at Kali's face. "I cannot tell you that I have the power to find it all, but we can try." Shifting again with his head tilting to one side, the boy takes on almost a chiding look. "None of us would have gotten off the asteroid without you. None of us. You are far from being a burden, and you can let go of the parts of you that you don't like."
Kalaria wrinkles her nose in disgust. "Do you ever ... I don't know, act someway besides cheerful and optimistic and calm and at peace? Because, between you and me and the conduits, that's really annoying for some reason," says the young woman as she reaches up to try and smear grease over Thandrim's face. Ah, a little mischievous spark of the old Kali hinting through.
Two blinks. It's all the more reaction Thandrim gives in response to Kali's grease attack. Yet then he gives her a 'look' and with a quick motion, the loose long end of one shirt sleeve is covered by the hand it normally protects and he reaches out to run the unblemished cloth across the human female's left cheek, removing some of the grime she'd aquired earlier! A little smirk takes to his lips then. "You make me dirty, I'll get you back and make you clean."
Stunned, that is what Kalaria is. And suddenly, her cheeks turn red and the young woman is taking a pair of staggering steps backwards. "I'm dirty? What? No, what are you... don't wipe..." Kalaria stammers and half turns away, scrubbing at both blushing cheeks before grumbling. "You're cruel," she says, not meaning it at all.
Thanks to Thandrim, the levity of the moment crashes and burns into some far flung Trinary Sun. Kalaria blinks and wraps her arms around herself, suddenly shivering as nods. "Yes... I know. I... I think I heard it talking to the Rodian, actually," she whispers with a frown. "It may not have been the box, but someone surely was. I heard him."
Kali shakes her head and frowns before turning to look at Thandrim with a long and steady gaze. "What... do I have to do? I'm so confused. I don't understand any of this. How did I ... what am I? How did I get to be this way? Have I always been like this?"
"Have a seat." Not that there is anything remotely like a chair here, but Thandrim does slide his back along the bulkhead crouching down. "There is nothing 'wrong' with you, if that is what you mean Kali. All of us, every being in the galaxy is born linked with the Force. We all create it, and it binds the galaxy together. Some beings are born with a greater affinity to it than others. Like the Skywalkers of old, good and bad. It's been a part of you your whole life just as it has been mine. And will be until we die and beyond really." A quick description, and maybe it will help her not feel like a monster, or like /he/ is a monster in some way. "As for what you have to do. Nothing, but I would not recommend that." A flash, for just an instant, that smile comes and is gone just as fast. "I would recommend that you learn about the Force, Kali. I'm no Jedi Master, and it's not like there are any temples left to take you to get /real/ training. But I can teach you what I know. Because once you know the ways of the Force and how to avoid the Dark side, then neither that box or even Krayt himself will be able to control you, use you, or dominate your destiny."
Kalaria sulks faintly, before just plopping down in front of Thandrim in a crossed-legged position. The spanner is settled in her lap, and absently fiddled with in spurts. With her nose wrinkling, and her lips sticking out in a faint pout, Kali just looks at the space between herself and Thandrim. "I ain't no Skywalker, thank the universe," she says with a deep exhale. You sure about that? Not even Krayt could... " she starts to ask before stopping herself and shaking her head.
"Okay. So I have to learn about the Force. And all I know right now is the vague mystical mumbo-jumbo you hear superstitious people talking about," is offers with a half-sigh. "So, you're saying it binds us... so like everything is connected? What else?"
"Well, without it life could not exist. Very importantly though, it can guide us. Not in the 'teacher guides a student' kind of way, but it can help us do what we need to do. Especially if we know how to use it. We can even, in a way, talk to each other through it." Thandrim tilts his head slightly and looks a touch sheepish now. "Like I said, I'm no Master. I've been stuck training alone with almost no guidance for years now. But I know some of how to use the force, and we have /both/ seen the terrible things that the Dark side can do if it is not countered. Back on Aloon, and even right in front of us, people unable to control themselves because they let the Dark side have sway."
With her shoulders slumping, Kalaria starts to curl in on herself at the last, the memory of what happened, what she saw, all of it weighing heavily upon her. "Yeah... not fun," she says softly, having no eloquent way of saying just how much the entire situation frightened and scarred her. She misses Thandrim's sheepish expression, something Kali will regret later, no doubt, so she makes no remarks on it. "You know more than I do, and that's a start, right?" she asks, apparently Thandrim's optimism is rubbing off.
"It's something, yeah. A start, if you want it to be. As I said, I won't force you, but I do want to help you. I don't want you to feel what you've felt, unable to protect yourself from it. And I don't want to see you turned into a pawn of the Dark side of the Force. There's no happiness or even contentment there, only pain." Thandrim is pointedly NOT looking at Kali just now, crouched down as he is. Those eyes might be studying the open conduit and wires within for all they move. "If you learn though, you can protect yourself."
"You'd think," notes Kali as she looks at her spanner as she tumbles it in her fingers, "A group like ours would have long ago gotten used to pain and bitter tears." Kalaria wrinkles her nose as the spanner drops from her fingers heavily on the metal plating of the floor. "The Dark Side... it either fuels your anger and hatred, or ... it wears you down to apathy, doesn't it?"
"You fuel your anger, the Dark side feeds upon it and drives you deeper into it. My Master taught me that the Sith use it, use their anger, fear and hate, to give them strength in battle. But it costs them their own free will, as they become slaves to those emotions, never able to break free and eventually yes so apathetic they no longer /want/ to be free." Thandrim answers back, recalling his lessons and trying not to recall that other image of his Master, the last one. "We've actually had a rather tolerable life, until now. Not pleasant or even preferable, but we had food, energy and even a little free time to leave buckets of slop propped up precariously on door ledges waiting for the next unfortunate person to open the door..." There's that smirk again.
Kali blinks and looks back to Thandrim. "That was you? Anazider blamed me for that, I'll have you know," she grumps, before the hints of a smile pull at the corners of her lips. "That was brilliant though," she says softly. The spanner is pushed around the floor with a finger as Kalaria watches it. She's trying not to shudder at Thrandrim's explination.
"What... what can I do?" she asks, softer now. "What can I do if I'm already growing apathetic, Thandrim?" Kalaria tries not to sound emotional before she frowns. "And... not being a slave to emotions means that you still feel them, right?"
The young man actually looks quite pleased with himself as Kali mentions that old prank. Though Thandrim's face goes more serious as she contemplates further. "You won't have to worry about not feeling emotions anymore, because when they does happen you will have died and become one with the Force. The difference between the Jedi and the Sith is that the Jedi... /we/ Jedi do not allow our emotions to control us. Fear, anger, contempt, ... love." There's an uncomfortable shift as Thandrim is still on his haunches crouched. "We feel them as firmly as anyone, but letting them dominate your actions never ends well. Besides, you are not apathetic yet. I can feel that much."
"I kinda want to be, though," says Kalaria with a sigh. "I guess... I'm just tired of being angry all the time, tired of be scared." Kalaria reaches up and rubs at her temples, fresh grease smearing across her skin from the movement.
Then Kali asks a strange question, "Do you ever have dreams, Thandrim? Nightmares or not that feel ... well... real?"
Thandrim does not respond immediately, eyes again dropping from Kalaria and to the hydrospanner between them. "Once, yeah." The voice is distant, but a blink or two later and he is looking at her again. "You have such dreams then? Often?"
Kali seems to shrink into herself again. "They're usually the same dreams," she notes softly, flicking at the spanner. "I think maybe I had dreams before we left Aloon, but they've been the same dreams since then." Pause. "Well, there was this one that was different."
"Describe it, if you are willing." Thandrim is all ears over this. Innate fore-seeing, while not unheard of, is very very rare he knows. And often more trouble than helpful.
The young woman offers a deep sigh and shoves at the spanner hard enough it lightly bumps into Thandrim's leg and she makes no move to retrieve it, instead plucking at her clothing. "Well, one dream is just reliving being shoved onto the ship by my parents and then it taking off. Another is I'm fighting alongside the Jedi even after the ship takes off. And ... one more is.. well..." Here Kalaria sighs and closes her eyes. "I have my hands around Krayt's neck, and I can feel the life draining out of him, and he's smiling."
Then Kali shudder and wraps her arms around her again, shaking her head. "The one, I ... don't really remember it. It was... cold, I remember that. Cold and I felt dark and lost and frightened. I woke up screaming, but... I don't want to remember it, okay."
Once more and for but a moment, a hint of a sad smile touches Thandrim's features. "Believe it or not, I have had those first two dreams too... many times." It was not a day to fail to leave an impression. "The third is troubling, but hopeful too. I know you want to kill Krayt, but even here your mind knows what darkness it would throw you into. Which is why he is smiling." The youth's head tilts again, to the right this time as he considers the last. "Some dreams /are/ best forgotten and allowed to be dreams. Or nightmares. I don't think anyone avoids having a dream that will leave you bolting upright in bed, drenched in sweat and afraid."
"I just wish it wasn't every single night," sighs Kalaria with a shake of her head. "It's ... I can smell the smoke, the ozone from the blasters, feel his fading pulse under my fingertips. It's just... they're all just ... to real and I wake up screaming into my pillow ever night."
Thandrim sighs to himself while a frown plays for control of his face. "I don't know of any way to stop you from dreaming. Except that I remember Lt. Stanzer talking about how you can 'control' your dreams once. I don't know his secret, or even if he was being truthful, but maybe it's something. Don't squeeze the life out of Krayt, smell something you like instead of ozone." The youth cannot resist a shrug. "It's not an answer, but it's the best I have for you right now."
The young woman is silent for a long moment, before she finally reaches out and snags the spanner, wrapping her fingers around it with white knuckles. "Yeah, you were right, Thandrim. You weren't really any help," Kali grumbles, her normal tetchy tone before she stands up quickly, ducking at just the last moment to avoid hitting her head on some conduit. "Anything else you want to help me with?"
The young Jedi gives a little shrug, still crouched and watching Kali get up carefully. "Depends on if you need someone with greater height or not." There's that bloody smirk again.
Kalaria rolls her eyes. "Like I'd let you touch anything down here if I could help it. You'd break it on accident. Like offering to open a jaw with that lightsaber of yours or something," grumbles the young woman. Her jaw tightens, in fact all of Kalaria tightens before she lets out a slow exhale, forcibly beating back her anger. She WILL gain control of her emotions, damnit!
Thandrim chuckles lightly as he shifts in preparation to leave. "Well then for the good of the ship, such as it is, I guess I will have to go huh?" Inwardly he wishes there was a switch he could just flip... he wishes he had the training to teach.. he wishes....

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-06 14:43:21)

Things had started out well for Kalaria. Okay, not really. She had been sitting in the space staring at the landing gear systems doing nothing. Then Thandrim showed up and started to calm her down, only to say just one thing which bubbled up anger and annoyance in her again. How that blasted ... JEDI ... managed to get on her nerves so is beyond Kalaria.
But, she did realize one thing, she hated being angry. The fact that Kali knows she is angry, only makes her MORE angry. So here she is, down in the crawlspace, hands and face covered with grease, fiddling and tweaking with the landing gear trying to figure out what was wrong and how to fix it.
Stretching the young woman uses a hydrospanner to make some fine adjustments, only to shift for a better reach, then bump her hand on a conduit. Doing so causes Kali to drop the spanner in a near impossible spot to reach. Growling in frustration and anger, the young technofiend slides onto her belly and twists to stretch as far as she can, her fingertips just out of reach of the handle of the spanner.
Alishai had been searching for Kali. Given the size of the ship, it didn't take her long to find the open hatch to the crawlspace. The clank of Kali's hydrospanner hitting the floor and the growl that followed provided a good second clue. 'Kali?'
At least Alishai is not sneaking up on her. Instead, Kalaria grunts as she tries to reach for the spanner again, before rolling over. "What do you want?" she calls up before sitting herself upright and looking around for something she can use to reach the spanner. "And yeah, I'm down here. Who did you think it was, Anazider?"
'I knew it was you. Just wanted to give you a warning. Is there room down there for the both of us?'
Kalaria sighs and stops her looking around, instead the young woman looks up at the opening just a little ways off. A lot of thoughts run though Kali's mind, and she more than minimally considers telling the woman to go away. Ten Kali lets out a resigned sigh. She's going to be trapped, one way or another no doubt eventually why not get it over with. "Yeah. I guess. Come down."
Alishai lowers herself down to join the younger woman. 'I guess you know why I'm here. You should know that I'm not going to force you to talk, Kali. But I will tell you you need to. You probably already know that.'
The young woman's eyes watch Alishai as she lowers herself down, then glance towards her spanner just out of her reach. Pursing her lips, Kalaria shifts uncomfortably before sighing again. "Yeah, well.. " she starts out saying, then shakes her head. "What am I gonna talk about, huh?"
Alishai settles down as best she can in the cramped space, then focuses her gaze on Kali. Her expression is concerned, but there is also something about it that suggests her sympathy will have its limits.Clearly, she intends this conversation to be a productive one.
'Let's start with your reaction to Thandrim being a Jedi and move on from there.' She suggests. 'You were terrified of him, Kali. Why is that?'
Sighing, Kalaria glances at Alishai before snapping her gaze away. "Not terrified of him... just ... " Kali shakes her head back and forth firmly. "Terrified of being LIKE him. I... oh it's hard to explain. You wouldn't understand, Alishai," she notes. "Thandrim just annoys me beyond reason. I'm scared of ... what comes with the mantle he wears."
One hand reaches up to run fingers through the spiky tails on her head. "I'm angry. REALLY angry, if you couldn't already tell. I know this. Makes me hard to get along with. I understand that, too. But... I have these dreams, Alishai. I replay the flight from Aloon almost nightly in one or two ways. And if it's not that, it's ... me killing someone and that leaves me chilled to the bone. And now you know why I try not to sleep or why I always wake up screaming. Okay? At this rate, I'm going to tell everyone about these damn things."
Alishai listens intently, then responds with a nod and a sigh of her own.
'I see. I'm going to tell you something now that you probably won't want to accept. You're in a dark place right now, and I can give you directions but you're going to have to find your own light. It's extremely important that you take what I'm about to say on board, Kali.'
'Thandrim is in control of his emotions. He may seem odd at times, maybe even a little inhuman. But he is defending himself from the Dark Side of the Force. If he were to give in to his emotions, he could let the Dark Side in, and if he did that it could eventually come to control him. Then he would hurt those around him, even the people he cares about.'
'You're sensitive to the Force too, Kali. You need to learn the same control. Your fear, your anger, they are both opening you up to the Force in ways you don't have the knowledge to prevent, immersing you in the Dark Side. The Dark Side feeds on those emotions, and causes you to draw on them more. I bet you've been getting angrier and angrier for some time now. Am I right?'
Blue eyes watch the wires and conduits as Alishai speaks, her jaw twisting back and forth as Kalaria actually tries to bite down her anger. She shifts uncomfortably before looking at her hydrospanner which is still just out of reach. This isn't fixing the ship. This is actually a fairly frightening conversation. Her hand reaches up and the woman wipes at her brow, spearing more grease across it.
"I don't remember -not- being angry," she finally grates out, trying to open up, to share, to not hold onto that anger and let it keep burning. "I don't remember anything before what I see nightly in my dreams." Turning around, Kalaria crosses her arms over her chest and narrows her eyes at the other woman. "So... what are you then? You and Thandrim speak similarly about the Force. And can you answer what -I- am as well? I'm scared, Alishai... that ... box, that THING... it's ... alive. I heard someone, and it might have been the box, talking. And then... when I passed out... it was... you were all dead. ALL OF YOU. I was on the ground, I saw boots, I tried to look up, then something hit me... everything was red, and it hurt so much... I was so scared, so cold, so ... angry and so cold. Then there was darkness."
The older woman laughs quietly.
'Well, I wasn't always a security guard. I've known a few Jedi in my time. I've been... quite close to a few.'
From the catch in her voice, it sounds like that admission cost her something.
'But as to what exactly I am, I'm afraid I'm going to be a little mysterious. Our enemy back there knew rather too much about us, and I've been thinking that any secrets we have remaining ought to be preserved in case they can be used to our advantage.'
'As to what you are... That's simple. You are Kalaria, a young girl with her whole life ahead of her, who can find happiness if she lets go of her anger and makes space for it inside.'
Alishai smiles slightly, kindly.
'You do have the strength to become a Jedi, I won't lie about that. But even if you choose not to, you have to learn something about the Force. Learn to control it. Otherwise you will never be free of your nightmares, or of that darkness.'
"That's just the thing, Alishai, I don't think we need MORE secrets, or, I guess the ones we didn't know about but now do," grumbles Kalaria shaking her head. "Anazider doesn't trust any of us as it is, we are beneath him. Does he need MORE reason to be suspicious of any of us after ... after... and Garic's all confused about what happened and... I don't know. " Shifting her jaw again, Kalaria shoves at a conduit, trying to reach the spanner with a growl of frustration. "I heard him... he was talking to me in my head! He was dark... he was evil... I know it. WHO IS HE? How did ... how did he find me?" says Kali before sighing and flopping flat on the ground.
"What if I don't wanna be a Jedi? What if I just want to be left alone, and to ... hide from everything. From ... HIM? What if I want to do that? How am I going to do that?" asks Kali with a sigh, her fingers just brushing the spanner, but not enough to pull it free.
"Freedom. It's all about freedom, yet ... oh, nevermind. I don't believe in freedom anymore either."
'Anazider,' Alishai comments quietly, and a little darkly, 'is another reason why I'd rather preserve my secrets. I think he'll be okay, but I know him least well of all of you. I wonder, now he has an ally in the bounty hunter Tinian, if he can ignore the temptation to sell Thandrim to the Sith.'
'As for who "he" is... I cannot tell you for sure, but I can make an educated guess. Darth Krayt, or one of his minions. Sith. And it may be difficult to hide now. I fear we have become entangled in Galactic events whether we like it or not. Events cannot conspire to force a choice from you, but they can conspire to restrict your options.'
'Kali, if you want to be free I'm not sure you can simply run until you find it. It might be something you have to win with your own strength... just remember, if that turns out to be the case, you do have friends who will lend you theirs if you need it.
Kali snaps her head up and looks at Alishai. "He wouldn't dare sell Thandrim to the Sith. No, that's a lie, he might if the price were right, and the deal was good for him." Kalaria frowns and looks down at the floor. "We can't let him do that. Well, -I- can't. If Anazider sell's Thandrim, he'd happily sell me, too. "
Sighing heavily again, Kalaria looks at Alishai's feet, then up at the woman a moment, mulling over her words. A wrinkle of her nose in distaste and Kalaria pauses with a blink as a thought occurs to her. "Okay, so we are embroiled in Galactic Affairs, I've heard Darth Krayt in my head, and we don't know if we can trust Anazider or not. Could be worse, I suppose. I could be a Skywalker."
Then Kalaria blinks again.
"I ... just made a joke," she says in surprise.
Alishai's lips twitch upward.
'And it was a good one.' She compliments.
Opening her mouth, Kalaria snaps it shut then shakes her head. "Just... keep an eye on Anazider for me. You think he's going to try and sell us out, let me know. I'll ... I don't know, smack up in the back of the head, hog tie him and get him somewhere else where Anazider can't find him." Then Kali blinks and frowns, laying flat against the ground again, and twisting just right to finally start pulling the spanner into her grip once more. "I just don't' want anyone sold off to Krayt. You know?"
'Of course. Don't worry, you and Thandrim will be fine. I'll see to it.' Alishai says, voice hard with resolve.
'At least until we part ways.'
Blue eyes narrow, and just as Kalaria is pleased to have her spanner back, her mood clouds once more at the last of Alishai's words. Reality, once more, returns rearing up it's ugly head. Gripping the thing, Kalaria just grunts and shifts to reach in to fiddle some more with the landing gear.
"Yeah, it always comes to that, doesn't it?" she asks in a dark tone. Then Kalaria shifts again before yanking on a wire. "I better get back to this," she grunts out and starts shutting down and putting up her angry walls like she does when she wants to be alone.
Alishai frowns.
'Yes, I'm afraid it does. I won't be leaving until you can look after yourself. But I left certain responsibilities behind seven years ago. Seven years of shirking my duty, just because I refused to risk my life making an escape. Seven years of questioning myself and my loyalties.'
'You are a friend Kali, and I would never just abandon you. But seven years ago I was forcibly parted from other friends, and they may be out there somewhere in need of my help. If I can find them, I will have to go to them.'
'Maybe, if by then you're ready and willing to stop running and take a side, you can come with me.'
"I didn't know I had to choose a side with you," says Kalaria flatly. At least she doesn't appear to be seething with anger. "There's a lot I don't know, and a lot you're not telling me and just hinting at, Alishai. That isn't helping me with this choosing sides thing."
Kali sighs, and leans forward, her forehead resting on some insulated conduit. "I'm sorry," she says after a moment. "You didn't deserve that."
'You don't have to choose a side, Kali. I'd not force you to. But I do think you won't get anywhere by running. And if you stop running, you'll probably have to pick a side... unless you want to go it alone.'
'...Okay. This sounds so childish, but... Can you keep a promise, Kali?'
Brows furrow and Kalaria casts a sidelong glance to Alishai for a moment. "Depends, I guess. If it's about selling Anazider off first, I'm not gonna do that. I may not be able to stand the man, but I'm not that cruel. I want to, mind you, but I know that's a bad path to run down. Other than that... yeah, I probably can."
'Then if I tell you what I am, you must promise to keep it from the others until I'm ready to tell them. And never tell anyone else - even if they try and pluck the information from your mind. To keep this promise, you will have to start your Force training.
"Start my Force Training? Thandrim was just here telling me that he's no master, and that he can't teach me much, but he'd try if I wanted. Alishai... what is it? What do you know?" asks Kalaria, turning fully around to the other woman. "I don't ... I don't want to go down the path of the Dark Side. I really don't. I just ... I am just USED to being angry all the time. People expect it, -I- expect it."
Alishai sighs. 'Make the promise, Kali, and I'll tell you everything I can. I just don't want Thandrim and Anazider to know. And it will be best to keep it from our enemies until the time is right.'
"This is very strange, Alishai. What's wrong with Thandrim? Anazider I understand but..." Kali reaches up and scrubs her head, loosing her hair and spreading grease as she does so. "Fine, fine. I promise. But ... you've got to explain WHY, okay?"
'Because he will not like the fact that I'm around. Particularly not if he thinks I have any influence over your training or decisions.'
Alishai reaches with her right hand up her left sleeve and withdraws a silver object - a lightsaber handle.
Kalaria blinks at Alishai, warily watching her as suddenly the hydrospanner is brought close to her and she tries to scoot away. "Why would he have an objection? What... what have I just promised to?" she asks softly, studying Alishai with wide eyes, afraid.
At the sight of the lightsaber, Kalaria's fear knits into confusion along as her brows knit closer together. She shakes her head, before eying Alishai and slipping further away. "I don't understand. Why ... why would Thandrim... why do you have to keep that a secret from him ... We need to trust each other right now. Am I the only one that realizes that? Why... why can't we trust each other now..."
Alishai bites her lip. It seems whatever is going to come is hard for her to say to Kali.
'Please, however you react, at least do it quietly... And I promise you I'm on your side...'
'He would object because he is a Jedi. And I am an Imperial Knight.'
Kalaria is silent for a long while, her gaze fixed and sturdy on Alishai, though she withdraws no further, she certainly isn't rushing to the woman either. The young woman's jaw shifts and she points to Alishai. "It's ... It's because of your Emperor that Krayt is in the position he is in the first place! Because you Knights and the Jedi couldn't get along. So what if you believe and train differently? Damnit, Alishai... damnit! Why ... Get out! Get out! I want to be alone now, before I start blaming you personally for everything! Okay?"
'Yes... Even the Emperor is just a man, who can be fooled like any other.' Alishai says sadly, pushing her 'saber back into hiding and getting to her feet. 'Remember that, Kali. Anyone can fall victim to the darkness. Anyone.'
'I know you are no friend of the Empire. I know why, too. But I hope you... never mind, you have to make your own decision.'
So saying, Alishai begins climbing from the crawlspace.

## Re: Chapter One "Awakening"

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-06 14:43:54)

scribed[3:15 PM]: For her part in the origins of this scene, which will no doubt become a debacle, Alishai sits in the recreation area, limited as it is, her eyes closed and apparently deep in thought.
chibiamy[2:43 PM]: Kalaria, not one to be quiet, alas, comes tromping in from the Engine room, grease mixed with sweat and smearing across the young woman's features. Looking at her hands, Kali wrinkles her nose in displeasure and hmmmpfs with a faint pout as she settles down into a seat.
scribed[3:36 PM]: 'I don't think Lacy will appreciate the stains.' Alishai comments, not opening her eyes.
chibiamy[2:27 PM]: "Funny that," notes Kalaria taking a deep and slow inhale, "I'd think she'd appriciate a working ship enough to overlook the stains."
scribed[3:10 PM]: 'I think she'll appreciate just getting the ship back.' Alishai allows.
Anazider[3:52 PM]: Anazider sits quietly, filtering through the information present in the Biddy Crate's archives, tacitly ignoring the two as they discuss the ship.
chibiamy[2:03 PM]: "Okay, that is a very valid point," notes Kalaria, pausing to lean and look back down the corridor from wence she came, before looking over at Anazider. "Gonna share what you're doing? Since ... well, we're trapped in even tighter quarters than normally and we're all pretty bored and need a distraction?" asks Kali, well, begs is more appropriate.
scribed[3:51 PM]: 'Speak for yourself. I'll take this over security detail in the mines any day. And I had one of the easier jobs.'
chibiamy[2:30 PM]: Eyes narrow at Alishai a moment. "You're not the one with the new excericise regemin," she drawls ever so slowly, before looking back to Anazider curiously.
Anazider[3:21 PM]: "I am gathering information. I'd like to know about this... Sarlacc Station, before we set down. Information is power, and we are sorely lacking."
scribed[3:39 PM]: The older woman smiles, leaning back. Her eyes would be focused on the ceiling were they open.
Anazider says this without turning to speak, or sparing the two a glance, his focus solely remaining on the screen.
chibiamy[2:06 PM]: "You are too smug," notes Kalaria to Alishai, before glancing back over to Anazider. "Huh. Good idea. I've been a bit ... busy," she notes, with a groan, one hand going to her stomach. "Want some help?" she asks, trying to be ... well ... nice.
scribed[3:55 PM]: I wouldn't dream of it. You know I still do those exercises myself...
Anazider[3:30 PM]: At Kalaria's offer of help, the nobleman does glance back, a silvered eyebrow upturned as he runs a critical gaze over her.
Anazider[3:13 PM]: "No, not particularly. You may be better served in making sure we do not fall a part while enroute."
Anazider[3:44 PM]: He then turns back to the computer station, and resumes his studies without a second glance.
scribed[3:53 PM]: 'She has been doing a good job of that already.' Alishai says in a reprimanding tone.
chibiamy[2:24 PM]: The urge to stick her tongue out at Alishai is too great and Kali succumbs. "I don't believe you," she notes before looking back over to Anazider. She blinks at the man, then her lips purse faintly. "What do you think I'd do after shifts? Slice into the Holonet and dig around and gather some information on targets i wanted to. Sheesh, I am actually, you know, useful with computers," says the young woman impetuously.
scribed[3:04 PM]: 'If you wish to spend less time on the ship I can help you Kali, I'm not mechanically inept.'
Anazider[3:37 PM]: "Oh, has she? The constant warning lights, and rattling bulkheads made me think otherwise." Anazider turns the station off and rises from his seat with a stretch. He folds his hands within his robes and makes for his bunk.
Anazider[3:24 PM]: "Do as you like. I will be taking a shower in the refresher."
Anazider[3:02 PM]: The prince departs the common room for the bunk he shares with (insert guy here), going over the spare clothes he managed to rescue from the Last Hope.
scribed[3:38 PM]: 'Arse.' Alishai comments mildly.
chibiamy[2:42 PM]: Kali considers a moment, looks at Alishai, and then pulls out her datapad which is constantly at hand. She taps a few things, then pauses. The young woman holds the datapad in a white-knuckled grip before looking up at the Falleen prince. "What did I ever do to you?" she snaps at the man's back, before crossing arms over her chest and falling back in the seat. "It's not like I don't know all of Krayt's secret bank accounts or anything..."
scribed[3:08 PM]: Alishai opens one eye. 'Do you?' She asks.
chibiamy[2:43 PM]: The young woman gives a pause, turning to look at Alishai for a moment. "I told you, I've been figuring out a way to ruin the man," she notes with a bit of a shrug. "Not all of 'em, probably. But a few. Can't slice 'em, they're pretty tough to get into. But I know where they're at."
scribed[3:09 PM]: 'Don't try it, Kali.'
scribed[3:36 PM]: 'Funding issues will not ruin a Sith Lord. And will only make him angrier.'
chibiamy[2:23 PM]: Kali purses her lips at Alishai. "I'm not completely dumb, sheesh. I haven't tried it." Then she grumps at Alishai. "Better than trying to wring his neck, honestly. And hey, if I can fun someone else that'll kill the bastard with his own money, why not?"
scribed[3:39 PM]: 'In fact, I suggest you stop looking. If you're caught...' Alishai opens both her eyes now, though they are narrowed. 'You don't want to be caught.
Anazider moves from the bunk to the refresher, securing the door before doffing his clothing and going about his shower, allowing the water to cascade over him and wash away whatever feelings of anger or disappointment he may be feeling.
chibiamy[2:44 PM]: Glancing towards the door, Kali frowns. "Wish I could take a shower for as long as I wanted whenever I wanted," she notes. "But apparently, I need to slave away in the engine room doing ... stuff..." she hmmmpfs before glancing at Alishai again. "Last time I tell you something," she says in a petulant manner.
scribed[3:24 PM]: 'Then it will be the last time you can benefit from my kindly meant advice.' Alishai retorts.
scribed[3:33 PM]: 'How is your training going?'
chibiamy[2:57 PM]: At that, Kalaria rolls her shoulders in a shrug. "Dunno," she says, eyeing the door again where Anazider is 'refreshing' as she speaks, "You'll have to ask Thandrim that. I have no idea how well it's coming or how poorly it is. Obviously the anger management isn't working becuse I'm pretty tee-d off right now."
scribed[3:51 PM]: 'I'll have a word with him. Or a blow.' Alishai says, following Kali's gaze.
scribed[4:04 PM]: 'You, in the meantime, mustn't let him goad you.'
chibiamy[3:26 PM]: "With which one. There are three 'him's aboard our little lifeboat," notes Kali with a sigh. She plays with the datapad trying to access the information that Anazider was looking over idly. "Isn't it... not worth the trouble or something? Goad me?! I mustn't!? I was being nice!" says Kalaria now flailing at Anazider's door.
scribed[4:05 PM]: 'I know that. He knows that. The fact that he behaved the way he did is symptomatic of a problem he has, not a problem of your own.' Alishai explains calmly, soothingly. 'You must rise above it.'
chibiamy[3:38 PM]: Kali narrows her eyes at Alishai. "And if I don't wanna?"
scribed[4:28 PM]: 'Then you are acting like a petulant child. Perhaps more importantly, you're doing what he wants you to do and that won't help. He will believe you even less worthy of respect and will condemn you. With his arrogant actions, Anazider is setting you up to continually self-fulfil his negative conceptions of you.'
Anazider[4:44 PM]: "I'll give the Mon Calamari this - they're one of the few that still use water-based refreshers in their designs... Recycled water, even though it may be." Anazider remarks to himself as he completes the shower sometime later. He looks about the sparse compartment for anything remotely resembling the luxury he's use to, and ends up with a sneer of disdain.
chibiamy[3:35 PM]: Kali purses her lips again and sticks her tongue out at Alishai. "What's wrong with acting like a petulant child? Never really had a chance to do so," she notes before sighing and setting down the datapad. "Oh, who cares what Anazider was looking up anyway."
thandrim[4:59 PM]: Emerging from the aft sections of the ship, Thandrim looks remarkably clean for a boy who sleeps in the main engine room. Hands linked together just before his body, he steps lightly enough in to add his own comments. "There is time to be a child, petulant or not, and time to be other things. Speaking of which, when is dinner?"
Anazider[4:11 PM]: Not finding much to dry himself with, he makes do with what he can find before retreating back to his bunk, clothed in not much else but a robe.
scribed[4:41 PM]: 'Whenever you want it.' Alishai snorts. 'We've only got self-prep ready meals anyway.'
chibiamy[3:40 PM]: Perhaps Kalaria was just surprised by Thandrim making his way out to the common area. Or perhaps it was his words. Whatever the case, the young woman's eyes open wide and she suddenly straightens stiffly, before turning to look at Thandrim. After just a second her eyes narrow, and Kali crosses her arms over her chest and with a 'Hmmmpf'. "You want dinner, make your own," she says.
scribed[4:22 PM]: Alishai looks between the two of them. Then:
scribed[4:24 PM]: 'Kali, just so you know I will be expecting you to recite the correct steps to clean a blaster tonight. Both pistols and rifles. While you're doing your exercises, of course. I may throw in vibroblades, as we wouldn't want you getting sloppy.'
thandrim[4:44 PM]: "I know, I know." Thandrim speaks with a dismissive wave of the hand continuing through the common room to the 'galley' side. Not that it could really be called a galley as such. "Does not hurt to wish though." Catching a glimpse of Anazider slipping from one room to the next, he affords no greater looks to the alien but rather sets about the simple self-prep meals that /are/ available.
Anazider[4:10 PM]: Upon arrival in the bunk, Anazider disrobes and uses his bunkmates bedding to dry himself, before quickly redressing in pants and tunic of a deep blue. The prince returns to the common room, leaving his silver hair hanging loose in an effort to allow it to dry.
chibiamy[3:14 PM]: The young woman, who had been watching Thandrim wander off to make his food, after all do they teach Jedi to cook? is caught and turns to peer back at Alishai. "Huh?" she asks at first in confusion then blinks. "WHAT?! Hey! Wait! You ... why would you do that?! What did I do to YOU, Alishai?!"
scribed[4:38 PM]: 'You became a lovely little Jedi potential under my watch.' Alishai says with a grin. 'I can't help you learn the ways of the Force, but I can help you prepare your body and your combat skills. And so I will.'
scribed[4:52 PM]: She deliberately makes her voice ominous: 'INTENSIVELY.'
thandrim[4:03 PM]: "Just don't keep her from ensuring this crate flies us somewhere relatively safe...." Thandrim's words are quietly given even as plastic crinkles and the internal heating process starts for the 'food.'
scribed[4:49 PM]: 'I've already told Kali that if she needs a break from repairs - or help - I'm qualified to assist. I have skills I never had to use in security...'
chibiamy[3:05 PM]: Kalaria whips back around to look at Thandrim with a narrowed gaze. "You're not helping," she drawls with a hint of a growl to her voice. Then she looks back at Alishai for a long moment, with nearly the same expression then just Hmmmpfs again. Closing her eyes, Kali sits back against the chair. "I aught to just sit here all night. Maybe Anazider you'd be so kind as to tutor me in proper behaviour, instead."
scribed[4:07 PM]: 'I think though, that she finds the job therapeutic so who am I to get in the way?'
scribed[4:07 PM]: 'I think though, that she finds the job therapeutic so who am I to get in the way?'
Anazider[4:23 PM]: Anazider quickly takes in the scene of the human members of the crew, gathered in one place, mentally storing away bits of the conversation for later dissection. He makes his way to the common couch, intent on keying up holo news.
scribed[4:25 PM]: 'Anazider wouldn't know proper behaviour if it poked him the eye.' Alishai says with a grin.
Anazider[4:30 PM]: "Proper behavior for what, pray tell?"
Anazider[4:19 PM]: His eyes narrow to crystal blue slits as he stares flatly at Alishai.
chibiamy[3:39 PM]: Kali opens her mouth and peers at Alishai. How come SHE gets to act like that and Kali can't. Then she turns to Anazider, and shrugs. "I dunno, honestly. You know my upbringing. Maybe a good merchant or business person or something. Someone that people don't ... oh, I don't know, want to shove out an airlock."
scribed[4:11 PM]: 'You disagree?' She defies him. Then her own expression, and her voice, go hard. 'Then apologise to Kali for the way you treated her. That was NOT proper behaviour, and you know it.'
thandrim[4:35 PM]: Watching food heat, Thandrim comments once again without looking. "Plenty of merchants and business people who have been thrown out of airlocks before."
Anazider[4:12 PM]: "I properly know that such jibes are beneath me. I also know that I never have, and won't begin to, apologize for anything I've ever done."
thandrim[4:47 PM]: "Including threatening to fire upon his friends." Still not a look.
Anazider[4:29 PM]: He turns his attention back to Kalaria, a slightly amused twirk playing across his lips as he pointedly ignores the other two in the room. "I could teach you the customs of the Imperial Court..."
scribed[4:55 PM]: 'And you will never grow as a person because of it.' Alishai says contemptuously, interrupting him.
Anazider[4:42 PM]: "Perhaps the fan language of the Nabooan royal house? What is it you wish to know." The prince waves a hand dismissively at Alishai, as if growing as a person was of little concern to him.
chibiamy[3:45 PM]: Kalaria, however, looks. Looks fly from Alishai, to Anazider, to Thandrim. "Hey, I did do that, in all fairness, myself," says the young woman sheepishly. Blue eyes look at Thandrim for a long moment, then down at her hands. "Heh. Me ... Imperial Court ... Now you're just making fun of me, Anazider. Its' cool. It's what friends are supposed to do, right, JOKE with one another?"
scribed[4:05 PM]: 'You'd fit right in, I'm sure.' Alishai comments, looking to the girl.
thandrim[4:52 PM]: "I'm not." Thandrim adds his words as his own meal is done. A spork used then to keep him from commenting further as he fills his mouth with food and heads to the table.
Anazider[4:58 PM]: Anazider snorts delicately, folding his hands within the billowing sleeves of his tunic. "It would take too much effort to make fun of you. You asked for lessons, and lessons, at least in this, is something I'm willing to give. Do you wish them or not; do not waste my time otherwise."
Anazider[4:48 PM]: He continues to watch the young woman, little emotion aside from amusement coloring his features. But his eyes continue to regard her in a cool, calculating fashion.
chibiamy[3:39 PM]: Kali starts looking around to the others, Alishai, Thandrim, Anazider, Thandrim, Alishai, and Anazider again, each getting a wary glance. "Yeah, I already know I need to cut back on the grease facials," she says to Anazider defensively. "No, Alishai, I don't think I would fit right in," she notes, before looking back at Anazider and straightens, lifting her chin a little. "But I wouldn't mind leanring how not to stand out so much."
scribed[4:28 PM]: 'Pfft.' Alishai expresses, turning her face from Thandrim and Anazider to shoot Kali a look meant to imply "ask me later about how much *I* used to fit in."'
Anazider[4:42 PM]: Anazider chuckles, the laugh having a musical quality. He reclines into the couch, as much as the slight cushioning will afford. "In any court, Imperial or otherwise, the key is not standing out, but knowing when and how to do so."
Anazider[4:06 PM]: "The first lesson, and most important is this: Presence."
Anazider[4:22 PM]: "You can be scruffiest farm hand from the dustiest portion of Tantooine, but if you can command the eyes of everyone in a room simply by entering it, then you have power."
chibiamy[3:58 PM]: Kali continues to eye Anazider dubiously, before nodding. "Okay, explain that one, because I'm sure I've got the wrong meaning in my mind," she offers with a hint of a shrug. Then an eyebrow arches upwards as she peers at Anazider. "Uh... not getting the picture there, but I think I get the meaning."
thandrim[4:21 PM]: Thandrim appears not to be willing to make further comments. In favor perhaps of shoving the recently chemically heated meal down his throat. He always did eat voratiously, now being no different. At least he's not losing half that food for flying about like a Gamorrean would.
Anazider[4:31 PM]: He looks from Alishai to Thandrim before returning his attention to Kalaria. "I'd be more than happy to go more in depth... Unless your other masters have something else in mind. More baiting, perhaps?"
scribed[4:40 PM]: 'You just described a Jedi. Well done.' Alishai says in amusement as she gets to her feet.
scribed[4:01 PM]: 'I have things to be getting on with. By all means continue.'
scribed[4:45 PM]: She steps around the table and fetches a meal from the food preparation area.
chibiamy[3:41 PM]: Kali peers at Alishai, frowning faintly to herself, and turns that frown back at Anazider. "I don't call anyone 'Master' by the way," she says with the hint of a disdainful sniff. Even if her eyes dart over to peer at Thandrim as the youth scarfs down his food curiously.
Anazider[4:24 PM]: "I was hoping the analogy was not lost on you." He comments off-handedly to Alishai. Anazider turns fully to Kalaria, focusing upon her.
scribed[4:37 PM]: Having the foil package in hand, Alishai throws a smile Kali's way and disappears into their shared cabin.
Anazider[4:44 PM]: "Your presence depends largely upon your bearing. How you carry yourself. In turn, this is dependent upon how you view yourself. Self image, and all that."
chibiamy[3:11 PM]: "Ahhh, yeah, self-image," says Kalaria nodding faintly. "Not the best right now, as I'm sure you could tell," says the young woman with a faint wince. Reaching up she runs a hand over her spikey hair, casting another sidelong glance at Thandrim as he eats, since Alishai's already off into the cabin where their bunks are. "I think it's the hazards of spending nearly half of one's life trapped on a mining ship. I could be wrong, though."
thandrim[4:20 PM]: Thandrim mutes a burp during a short pause in his eating. Then resumes.
scribed[4:24 PM]: In the bedroom, Alishai gets on with relaxing on her bed. She had lied, of course, but she cared little about the nuances of the court. Besides, she'd been there, done that.
chibiamy[3:43 PM]: Glancing over, Kalaria peers at Thandrim, then reaches out with her leg to kick him in the shin for the muted burp. "If you didn't eat so fast," she says softly, before giving Anazider a sidelong look, then looking back to Thandrim. "We get to the station, you're in charge of finding more food. The way you eat, we're gonna need it."
thandrim[5:38 PM]: For whatever else he might be Thandrim /is/ still no adult. A smirk touches his lips even as he swallows down the sustinance and eyes back. "Growing boy and all you know. Besides, the way these things taste, it's best to take them in fast and minimize the flavor you are subjected to hmm?" Then he smiles, and not quite slurps the last spork-fulls to clear the meal.
chibiamy[4:13 PM]: Kali blinks at Thandrim and digs into her pockets to find something that won't hurt TOO much to throw at Thandrim. "You're horrible," she notes to the young Jedi, before eyeing the packet. "And you've made me hungry for those awful things. Thanks," she drawls with a shake of her head as she stands and starts to move towards the galley herself.
Anazider[5:17 PM]: Anazider watches the interaction between Kali and Thandrim with the same lingering amusement. He hops to his feet from the couch, speaking over his shoulder to Kalaria as he makes his way towards the passenger quarters. "Remeber: how you carry yourself is more important than how you appear. You're a beautiful girl when you've a mind to be."
chibiamy[4:12 PM]: Kalaria blinks and stares outright at Anazider at the compliment, her mouth gaping open until she remembers to close it. A faint nod is given and Kali just watches the Faleen prince before peering at her food packet. "I'm... going to go back and work on the engines, I think..." she says to no one in particular before turning around and walking down the corridor.
thandrim[5:04 PM]: Thandrim rubs a cheek after he sets the tray that once held some form of food on the table and pushes it back some. Likely he /could/ eat more of it, but that will do for now. One hand then rubs at the back of his neck to watch Kalaria go and relax a moment there. Still much to be done there.
