# [Tapestry] Chapter 2: Way Down in the Jungle Deep

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**STAR WARS: Tapestry, The Tattered Edges
Episode II: WAY DOWN IN THE JUNGLE DEEP**</span>
The travel through hyperspace has been a mostly uneventful one, allowing for a few days respite after the frantic escape from the Wheel. The crew of the *"No Chance"*, comrades in strife (for the moment), has had the opportunity to get to know one another as much as time, proximity, and personality has allowed.
For their part, Kurr and Rehn have managed to keep the rusty bucket in the starlanes, with Nestil standing watch over them to make sure that they do it *right*. Although the old patrol boat is creaky in places, its structure is solid internally and it served admirably in the scrum over the space station. On a more thorough inspection, no other surprises awaited the pirate and his gang, not counting the shipment of *extremely* well aged Nerf Cheese found in one of the cargo storage compartments.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With the battle over and their ship zipping through the safety of hyperspace, Wes's hibernation sickness returned to him fully, the ancient Mandalorian near collapsing in his gunnery chair. He has spent a majority of the transit in the empty bunk affectionately referred to as the "Sick Bay", left to empty the contents of his stomach as he sees fit.
Al'verde stands watch over his brother-in-arms-and-armor, using a menacing wave of his massive powerhammer to ward away the historian's attempts to study Wes or Nestil's much more aggressive attempts to recruit him. Over time Wes's retching stops, and he recovers much of his strength, but could still do with a proper bed and a meal hardier than spacer rations.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Callia has found himself in a tinkerer's paradise, the *No Chance's* major systems amounting to a tangle of nonsensical functionality and shoddy backwater mechanic work. Many have been the times that the running lights have flickered or the artificial gravity has been deactivated during the scientist's mad workings, only to be unceremoniously turned back on, often times at the most inconvenient of moments.
He has found a like intellectual in Oraltor, but between the Ithorian's incredible bookishness and Callia's random bouts of disinterest, not much of a relationship forms there. The Jedi historian has occupied himself with pouring over the oubliette with a delicate care, an occasional "Oooh!", "Aaah!" and "How fascinating!" rumbling from his throats to interrupt the silence.
Thusly does their time pass, with Solsis VII and further unraveling of the mystery that is the Jebble Box on the horizon...
********************************************************************************
With a sudden shudder, the *No Chance* drops out of hyperspace although fortunately it is at the outer edge of the Solsis system. This isn't the usual, "What the hell is Callia doing now?!" shuddering as it becomes more violent by the moment, the lights flickering until they go completely dim and the emergency lights sputter into illumination. Unbeknown to the rest of the crew, the mad scientist stands staring at the relay that feeds the ship's refresher units, while behind him the primary hyperdrive coupling has caught a flame...
Those at the helm notice that they are running on auxiliary power, and there's no assurance that it will last them the rest of the distance to their destination. Solsis VII is in sight, and growing larger as the boat stutters forward on it trajectory. A large frigate soon comes into view, looming just in orbit around the jungle planet. Several pieces of what appear to be debris, and soon resolves themselves as starfighter drones, break off from the larger ship and embark upon an intercept course of the *No Chance*, although their weapons are not active as of yet.
**"Unidentified transport, this is the Ali'La. Transmit your transponder code and state your business in the Solsis system."**
The voice is raspy and decidedly humanoid, but spoken in Basic. Although the communique comes through clearly, the tail-end of the message is interrupted by a bark of haughty laughter.
**"Yes… Do state your business spacer, as you are a long way from *civilization*."** 
From around the planet, in an orbit opposite that of the Ali'La, an even larger frigate presents itself. From it issues a flight of larger starfighters, Predators from the looks of them, and the *Chance's* scanners soon identifies the ship as an Ardent-class Fast Frigate. The Dark Lord's Ship "Voracious". The unmanned fighters scatter as the Predators perform a flyby on the patrol boat, and a low grumbling can be heard over the comm channel from the Solsian frigate. The Sith ship remains silent, awaiting a response.
**((SPECIAL <!– s=> –>![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!– s=> –> Consider the No Chance at -4 on the Condition Track, until actions to repair the damage are taken, and no hyperdrive until the appropriate parts are replaced))**

Rehn swore under his breath. That frakking Ithorian took them from one hostile port to another. He hit the comm, hailing the Ali'La right back. **"This is the -"** He rubbed the buttons on his sleeve over the microphone to create the illusion of static. **"We're bringing in a shipment of aged Nerf Cheese for -"** More static. **"We had some trouble with a supergiant a few parsecs back and -"** Static again. **"As soon as our computer is back running -"** Static. **"- our transponder code."** He shut down the comm.
**"Hammerhead, get your nerfherding flank in here!"** he shouted back into the corridor. He glanced at Kurr. **"Do you think they'll have our original transponder code?"**
(Deception+9 + Force point.)

Callia stares at the refresher relay, trying to decide whether it is worth tinkering with. He had noted when using the refresher unit earlier that its pressure is inconsistent, and inconsistencies aggravate his mechanical mind.
*Yes, its worth spending some time on after all,* he concludes just seconds before the *No Chance* makes its violent re-entry into realspace and he is shaken from his feet.
As usual his droid companion Jasper bobs around nearby, its repulsor propulsion systems allowing it to ignore the tremors that wrack the ship.
'Master, are you unharmed?' Jasper queries, offering his creator a limb and helping him to his feet.
'I'm fine Jasper, just fine. Shall we get to work on the relay?'
Jasper turns Callia around while his second snake-like appendage points out the flaming hyperdrive coupling.
'I think we have a more pressing task, Master,' he suggests.
'Oooooh dear. You may be right, I suppose I *should* prioritise my jobs,' Callia says resignedly as he straightens his lab coat and puts on his best impression of a sensible, respectable person. It almost suits him, if you ignore everything about his eccentric appearance.
'Well then,' he continues, walking over to an access panel and popping it from the wall, 'put out that fire then come help me regulate the power.'
'Yes Master!'
((OOC: Callia [Mechanics +17] will be taking the Regulate Power action as many times as it takes to remove the condition penalties. JS-PR will attempt to aid him each time, automatically succeeding since his Mechanics skill beats the DC 10. That bumps Callia's modifier up to +19 which means he *also* automatically succeeds at regulate power's DC 20.))

Al'verde had just finished adjusting his cannon and hammer so they would fit back into their concealed slots before he adjusted his cape and looked around the ship. His H.U.D. was still switched on, due to habit, and locked onto the first thing that moved. He quickly switched it off before that cannon came back to life. He knew that last then they needed was a hole on the ship. As he walked around he noticed Callia and his droid working on the ship trying to help undo the damage from the fight they managed to escape. He though about offering to help but figured he would just get in they way. His mind still played back the last shot he pulled off. If he had only had those reflexes when he was with his team he might have been able to save them, rather than them having to save him. He made his was to the commons area and sat down. He slowly pulled his helmet off and sat it down on the table in front of him. He reached into one of his bandoliers and pulled out a flack. He quickly undid the top on took a swig of the liquid inside. With a deep breath he tried to not let the past get to him, after all he had a new crew to protect. He knew that one of the other things he needed to do was get his own fighter of some sort. He needed better weapons and he hated not being in control. He made a mental note to talk to the pilot if he was going to be stuck on this ship for a while.

The retching had finally stopped.
lying there in the make shift medical bed sans armor Wes looked up at the transports ceiling. ***What did I do to end up here. And can I go back to fix it?*** The Mandalorian warrior thought to himself. His body was still sore though not as bad as when he had awoke. Cramps and stiffness still plagued him but with a few more days and some better food he was sure he'd be up to fighting strength again. He put the thought out of his head. He never whined about life before and he wasn't going to start now. Yes the galaxy was different. Vastly different than the one he left over a hundred years ago. He would make do and once again bring honor and glory to the Del-Fin clan.
----
Looking to his side he noticed that Al had stepped away. Wes was thankful that a Vod had been there to watch him. He needed the rest and with the Imperial Knight and the Jedi historian asking questions it was hard to rest. Yet Al had kept them at bay.
Swinging his legs off the bed he sat up with a noticeable stiffness in his muscles. He looked at his armor that was close by. Sliding off the bed and grabbing what passed for under armor clothing he walked to the refresher to clean off. When finished he donned the garment and put his armor back on and grabbed his carbine. The environmental systems kicked on and the HUD came up stating all systems were functional. Smiling he removed the helmet and walked to the common area where Al was sitting. Placing a armored hand on the large armored shoulder of Al he spoke. **"Thank you Al. Its good to know that our ways are still around despite these sounding turbulent times."**
As the ship came out of hyperspace quickly Wes shifted his weight to keep balance. his hand on Al's shoulder also kept him from falling.
**"That didn't feel right did it?"**

Kurr stared out the viewport and gritted his teeth as Rehn sent over the message. "We're space dust," he muttered to himself. Looking to Rehn, he replied, **"Whatya mean our original transponder code?! Sonovabospor … yer th' gristin' computer whiz, can't ya make one up, Pinkie? Maybe we ken get th' kid an' that trash can up here t' help ya … gotta find sum use fer 'em before I space th' pair …"**
Snatching up the ship's intercom, Kurr announced to the ship, **"Oy! We've got sum problems up here Mates … if sumone'd be kind o'nough t' bring th' karkin' Hammerhead up here … maybe he could answer a few things. Otherwise, ye may want t' hold on t' yer preciousness an' get ready fer a mighty abrupt landin'!"** Looking back at Rehn, then back to the viewport, the Feeorin strapped on his buckle and starting plotting a course for the planet. **"I hope that bluff o' yer's worked Pinkie … cause if not, we're gunna have t' make a run fer it …"**
**[OOC: Prepping for a fast getaway if needed …]**

**"You don't have a backup transponder code?! I can't just make one up on the spot like that. I can't just type in a series of random numbers and hope it passes as a code! These things take time! This is your frakking ship, and you're telling me you don't have another frakking transponder code."** Rehn muttered more curses under his breath, waiting and hoping the Sith didn't need one. **"If I have to give them our real code and it's in their databanks, we're all gonna get spaced. You know that right?"**
(OOC: Out of curiosity, how long does forging a transponder code take?)

### **Anazider** (2010-02-17 23:59:51)

**"Wha? What is wrong, what- OW!"**
A great deal of scuffing and clanging is heard as the Ithorian hurries his way towards the cockpit like a drunken Bantha over a particularly shifty sand dune. When he arrives in the cockpit and takes in the scanner and the warship looming in Solsis VII's orbit, his eyes blink wide on top of their eyestalks and he begins to dry-wash his hands.
**"Oh no… No, no, no… There were never any Sith here, its suppose to be to remote a backwater! I hope the Hobben are all right… And what of Jakira? Or more importantly, my research?!"**
Oraltor squeaks to himself in worry and begins pacing behind those assembled around the captain's chair. The Jedi turns back to fret further, when a pair of communiques cuts him off.
**"I do not see any scheduled shipme- "
"You're cleared to land Spacer. And please try not to get eaten by anything."**
The comm trails off with more grumbling from the Solsis frigate, and a muttered conversation about "the Savages" and "The Governor's obsession with cheese." The element of Predators breaks off on a return flight back to the Voracious, as do the starfighter drones of the native frigate. Kurr is able to guide the No Chance through the Solsis VII atmosphere with no small amount of turbulence, but after the trip through hyperspace to the planet the rocking and jostling seems as gentle as a mother's embrace.
********************************************************************************
A torrential sheet of rain greets the patrol boat as it breaks through the atmospheric cloud cover and it is the patrol boat's ever-persistent guide through a tropical treeline that would make even an Ewok dizzy. The No Chance narrowly avoids collision a countless number of times before it belly flops onto an available landing pad, the retractable landing gear deploying at just the last minute. A loading droid cobbled together from the many varied (and often times incongruent) pieces of other loading droids roll-crawls over to help unload the Chance's cargo, but there's really no other port authority in sight.
Few of the indigenous Hobben patrol the space port, and those seldom few carry ancient blasters and armor obviously crafted from materials native to the world. What are more plentiful are the Imperial naval commandos, and the occasional stormtrooper squad, that prowl the corridors of the space port, their blaster rifles and armor of the highest Imperial issue. But as the crew of the No Chance progresses through the halls, the soldiers don't spare them a second glance, their attention focused on making sure that the Hobben stay in line.
While the docks are mostly uninteresting, the center of the spaceport is predominated by a massive atrium that showcases the most exquisite specimens of Solsis VIIs flora, and some of its more benign fauna, as well as a transparisteel dome that gives a heavenly few of the rainy tree canopy. Directly ahead of the crew, and across the atrium, is a spacer Cantina, its half-lit sign aptly naming it the "Power Surge". To their left is a massive, and rather bustling mongers bazaar, while on the right is a walkway that leads out into the capital of Inlu'la, and the rest of the jungle proper.
********************************************************************************
**"For the last time doctor Jakira, we have shared with you every resource that we can spare! It takes nearly all we have to maintain some measure of civilization here and around the garrison. I don't know how these sav-… lacious, salacious! Hobben have managed it all this time!"**
Shifting his eyes from one corner to the other, the governor licks index and middle fingers and uses them to smooth back the four strands of hair left on his sweaty pate. To call Radge Rothke bulbous would be kind to him and cruel to bulbs. A nose that resembles a well-mashed potato dominates the center of his face, and the set of eyes just above it are set so close together as to almost be monocular.
Yet no matter how mental or physically deficient the garrison Governor may appear there are two things he does appear to have in abundance: Greed and Avarice. A pair of black-armored stormtroopers flank him to either side, heavy blaster rifles held at perfect parade rest. Those few citizens strolling through the atrium ignore the exchange, although a few spare the Zeltron doctor sad-eyed smiles of sympathy.
**"Although… I suppose more supplies could be appropriated… If certain considerations are made, hmm?"**
The Governor's smile is enough to make a Zeltron turn blue, and it doesn't take Jakira's innate empathic abilities to glean Radge's intent.
********************************************************************************
**"Kurr, is that you? Why you ol' one-eyed Kath Hound, how the sith are ya?"**
A gruff, booming voice echoes around the quiet atrium, coming from the direction of the bazaar. Its owner soon comes swagger out of the market: a stumpy Besalisk wearing the overalls and tool bandoleer of a mechanic.
Before the pirate has a chance to belch in surprise, the Besalisk is charging across the atrium and sweeping Kurr up in a bone-crushing Wookie hug.

Perhaps strangely, it seems Callia is quite excited to see the planet on which they have landed. The discovery of a distinct lack of repair components on board, including the necessary coupling to get hyperdrive flight working again, cements his decision to leave the ship.
He walks with the group, apparently more aware of his surroundings than usual: as physically evidenced by the fact his goggles are pushed up his forehead rather than over his eyes, causing his already wild hair to spike up all the more. Those eyes dart about with unbridled curiosity as the ragtag bunch of "comrades" makes their way through the spaceport tunnels.
As ever, JS-PR follows Callia like a loyal puppy. For once he doesn't talk too much, apparently content just to see his master out and about.
Callia beams when he spots the bazaar. He may find the needed parts there, or at least get to see some cool gizmos.
'The ship's broken. I'll find stuff to fix it,' he briefly explains before peeling away from the party and crossing the atrium, ready to plunge himself into the colourful marketplace.
'Oh dear,' Jasper says with apparent resignation as he turns in the air to keep the Fyrthen in view of his sensors, 'not again. Wait for me, Master!'
'Come on Jasper, you're lagging!' Callia shouts over his shoulder, the sound of his voice echoing slightly around the large chamber.

Rehn sank back into his chair as the *No Chance* approached on their landing vector. They had done it--they'd gotten past the Sith with nothing but a pair of goggles and a particularly convincing lie. After the ship landed, Rehn supervised the removal of the stinky cheese, making sure the loading droids were not programmed to try anything funny.
As soon as that was finished, he followed the others off the ship. When they approached the atrium and Rehn spotted, the cantina, a wide grin split his face. He grabbed Oraltor with his mechanical hand and dragged him toward it. "Let's go Hammerhead, we have business to discuss. Then you can go off and find your research and that Jack person. Got it?" There was no question in his voice--he had risked everything to get that Ithorian off the station. He was getting paid. Now.
(I'm going to assume that Oraltor hasn't yet paid him. If so, well, I'll think of something else.)

Al'verde looked up as Wes and offered him a drink. As the ship docked he took the flask back and donned his helmet. With a quick hiss of air the vacuum seals closed and the H.U.D. flickered to life. With a quick flick of his left wrist the power hammer sprang out before retracting back into it's hidden slot. His cannon also sprang up and rested on his shoulder for a few seconds before retracting as well. After adjusting his cape he took a deep breath and lightly hit Wes on the shoulder "Ok vod'ika, lets get going. I think I'm going to try and find a cheep fighter if I'm going to stick with this bunch." he said, his helmet hiding his smile.
As he walked down the ramp he held his shoulders up and slightly back, presenting a commanding presence as he scanned the area. He noticed a Zeltron who seemed to be bargaining for something. He also noticed the two stormtroopers. He laughed as he noticed their blaster pistols. He double checked the his holdout pistol was still hidden as he took a few steps in their direction. He didn't want to start a fight...well not all of him. He was happy to be off the ship but his mind was still not settled from the fight. He figured if nothing else he could look around for an arena or someplace he could get rid of all his pent up anger and figured that if he helped one of the locals they would be willing to help him. He took a few more steps towards the Zeltron and made sure he kept his wits about him, he never did like dealing with government officials.

Jakira's smile never left her expression as the lecherous man hinted his intentions. If there was anyone salacious on the planet, she thought, it was this man. She forced herself to keep her usual demeanor and not to shudder as he continued with his overture. Instead she tried to approach the other aspects of his personality, greed. The Zeltron wished she had something to use to bribe the man, but her clinic had never been wealthy. It had been almost breaking even by the time the Sith appeared, now it was a struggle to get the simple necessities. The Hobben people were suffering under the Sith's rule and Jakira had resigned herself to doing what she could with what she had for them.
Leaning forward slightly toward him, she takes her voice lower. "**The Hobben are fortunate to have such a benevolent governor looking out for their interests. With these supplies I'm sure your superiors would be pleased to know that production would increase as more workers are able to come to your call.**" She continues on in the same tone, standing up straight once more. "**Production I understand has been decreasing as the amount of injuries from accidents increase. Without the supplies, I am unable to attend to their needs and without the Hobben, you lose your cheap source of labor. Which is more worthwhile? Bringing in supplies to take care of the workers you have, or importing workers who don't know the planet which are more likely to be killed by the planet?"**

The Feeorin pried himself from the Besalisk's grip, muttering out, **"Easy there, ya ole tibana hustler, I'll be needin' that spine fer later."** Kurr chuckled as he felt the blood begin to circulate through his system again. **"Bloody nass, Mate, where've ya been hidin' yarself? Last I heard, ya'd ran across a bad deal with some Iridorians a while back."**  Looking over the Besalisk, he added, **"What … ya're not workin' here, are ya Mate?"** Getting a sly smile across his lips, he continued in a slightly hushed tone. **"Don't suppose ya've got time fer a drink … an' maybe sum dealings with ole friends now … do ya?"**

Wes took the offered drink and took a good hit from it. The burning sensation that it made in his chest was a welcome feeling. Wes felt the ship dock and handed the flask back to Al. Together they put their helmets on. The armors systems kick in and sealed itself as the HUD came back on and showed all systems green. The suits cooling system kicked in and cool air began to move about the inside of the armor.
"Ok vod'ika, lets get going. I think I'm going to try and find a cheep fighter if I'm going to stick with this bunch." Al said as he lightly hit him on the shoulder.
**"Vod'ika huh?"** Wes said as he looked at the bigger Mando next to him. **"Have you forgotten that I'm around a hundred years older than you are?"** He said with a chuckle as he checked his carbine making sure it was ready to go.
Disembarking with Al Wes took in the surroundings. Old habits die hard as he spots the storm troopers that are posted and the moving patrol.
It didn't take long for them to reach a cantina. The *Power Surge* as it was called seemed aptly named was in a good position right between the bazaar and the capital and the jungle.
**"Seems like a nice place."** Sarcasm evident in his voice. **"Reminds me of one of the planets I was on during the Vong war. As I recall the poodoo hit the fan there. Was a real mess."**
He looked at the others as Callia announces that he's off to find parts for the ship. And then quickly veers off towards the bazaar. HIs little droid following along quickly expressing words of concern.
Wes snorted. **"I'll follow Callia and see if I can keep him out of trouble or from forgetting where he is and getting lost. I'll keep my comm open if you need to get a hold of me. Watch yourselves."**
Wes turned to follow Callia and Jasper into the bazaar. To be honest just getting out was nice. Now if he could find something good to eat that would make this stop even better.

**"You know it'd take more than a pack of blood-howlin' Iridorians to steal Thunner's thunder, eh boy!"** The Besalisk releases Kurr and then smacks the Feeorin along his upper arms with both sets of hands.
**"What is it, 9:00am galactic standard? Yeah, I can toss back a few, and then a few more! Then I can tell you about the sweet gig I've got here, and you can tell me about yer new friends!"**
Thunner claps an arm around Kurr's shoulders while the other three slide into pockets. They head towards the *Power Surge* in lock-step.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oraltor peaks around the corner of the exit ramp, but doesn't have much time to make sure that the coast is clear as Rehn grabs him and drags him along. The Ithorian tries to put the breaks on, but the Zeltron was being rather insistent.
**"We have to -Ow!- secure the Oubliette first -Ow!-, especially with the,"** The Jedi looks both ways before speaking to Rehn in a not-quite-a-whisper, **"Sith around! We have to get it to Jak- Oh, there she is!"**
Breaking stride, the Ithorian begins to galumph his way to where the Jakira stands talking to the imperial governor, dragging Rehn along for the ride. It soon becomes a tug of war between Oraltor's absent-minded bulk and the slicer's wiry thirst for credits.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As Wes and Callia enter the Bazaar, their senses are assailed by a host of sites, sounds, and scents that are both familiar yet wildly alien. Multiple food stalls dot the bazaar grounds, hawking things that are crunchy, slimy, and still wriggling (some doing all three at the same time) as the pair pass by. Others sell jewelry, clothing, and other fine goods made from Solsis VII's bountiful harvests. While the Hobben merchant's smile and speak loudly in often-times broken Basic, their eyes continually dart to the Imperial troopers standing guard at random intervals throughout the market, and there is a general sense of uneasy tension permeating the place.
Directly to their right upon entering, and taking up a majority of that side, is a huge electronics store with some of its more animated wares spilling out into the general market.
**"Thunner's Cloud: Mechanics Emporium and Repair!"**
The sign above the shop reads clearly and in several trade languages, while a pair of protocol droids stand out front handing out fliers with the day's deals printed on them. They sing a catchy little diddy in their monotone voices, and the bulk of their flier-distributing efforts can be seen jammed into garbage receptacles all over the bazaar.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Radge caresses a sausage-like finger down Jakira's jaw, tapping her chin as it reaches the point. The doctor catches a whiff of a rather odd cologne from the governor's pudgey digit: *extremely* well-aged Nerf Cheese, perspiration, and something else wholly unidentifiable and cringe-inducing. He chuckles, the rolls of fat insulating his throat bouncing at mind-boggling angles.
**"My dear sweet Jakira, I think you misunderstand their position in this whole affair: the Hobben work for the glory of the new Sith Empire. They toil out of love for Emperor Krayt, even unto their deaths. Now, I have offered you a means to ease their burden, righteous though it may be, but still you rebuke my attempts at… *negotiation*. Is it not you who is doing more harm then good here?"**
The Governor's creepifying is interrupted by the sound of heels clicking together; his two honor guard stormtroopers coming to attention as a tall armored figure approaches. Radge turns in an exasperated huff which then turns into a piggish squeal of fright when he sees that the figure is wearing Mandalorian armor. The pair of stormtroopers have yet to level their weapons, but they hold the heavy blasters in a readied posture and appear very well practiced in their use.

When the Ithorian sauntered off track, Rehn groaned. "Ooh, it's a Zeltron," he said sarcastically. "You want one of those? You got one right here!" he exclaimed waving his free hand in front of the Ithorian's face. "See me? Yeah? Good. Cantina first, pleasure later."
As he steered the Ithorian around, he glanced back at the Zeltron woman. It had been a long time since he'd seen one of his own species around, and she wasn't hard on the eyes, either. But first things first: credits. "Let's go, Hammerhead. You can come back as soon as I'm paid every credit you owe me."

### **Alicia** (2010-02-21 16:12:54)

The Zeltron doctor does her best to keep her expression the same and resists the urge to hurl as the governor caresses her jaw with his disgusting finger. At that moment she wishes she hadn't approached the man. She doesn't turn as she hears the clip of boots behind her, instead her attention is suddenly diverted to the sight she sees behind the governor. Her carefully held expression suddenly turns into a look of surprise as she sees the Ithorian Jedi Historian and then her eyes close in dismay, her expression turning neutral once more. With a silent prayer she opens them quickly, hoping to get this taken care of before Oraltor was recognized by the governor.
Seeing the governor's fear she finally looks behind her to see the tall, fully adorned Mandalorian who she had never seen before. With only a moments hesitation, she reaches out to embrace the man affectionately. "**Oh, darling! Sorry if I kept you, I hope your not too upset.**" Drawing away just a little, Jakira indicates the bulbous man in front of her with one hand while the other remains securely wrapped around the man's waist. "**I was just speaking to the governor about getting the needed supplies for the clinic.**" In a lower voice almost a whisper she adds to the Mandalorian. "**We seem to have reached a stalemate in our negotiations.**" She knows if the man follows along with the ruse she may have to pay him back for helping her, but he was hopefully a better prospect than the disgusting man who only wanted one thing from her.

Callia claps his hands together several times as he surveys the outer facade of Thunner's Emporium, then he begins whistling while sauntering past the protocol droids to see what there is to see within.
His whistling soon develops a distinct tune, to which he suddenly puts an impromptu song. Callia's singing voice is surprisingly good, and rather gentle, though his lyrical sense may be a little off.
*'Here power coupling,
Pretty power coupling,
Callia needs you to fix a ship.
I need one that fits,
And some other bits,
So we can all continue our trip.
Without you we'll 'splode,
and we'll frazzle our diodes,
And the hull will probably rip.'*

Kurr chuckled and said, **"Well good … after what I've been through, I could use a good drink er three."** Walking into the bar, he motioned Thunner towards a more private booth in a corner facing the door. Snagging a couple bottles of ebla beers, he slid into the booth and looked at the Besalisk. **"So, what the grist ar' ya doin' on this krinkin' hole o' a planet?"** Kurr grinned as he slid one of the beers to his friend. **"And what's this sweet deal yar talkin' 'bout, Mate?"** Popping his bottle open, he took a swig, waiting to hear of any news, and occasionally sneaking a look to the door ... just in case.

Al'verde has to keep himself from laughing when he saw the governor's reaction. It was one of the many perks to being a Mandalorian with his status. Not only did he have the Mandalorian armor but he had the heavy armor, with modifications that make lesser Mandalorians think twice about starting anything with him. Just as he was about to say something just to get a small reaction out of the man the woman wrapped her arms around him and held him as if he was her lover. This threw him off at first, as he did not remember ever finding a woman that could deal with him for more than fifteen minutes. He looked down at the woman as she spoke to him ***"Oh, darling! Sorry if I kept you, I hope your not too upset."***...*Darling!?!?…DARLING?!?!?! What in the hell has this woman been drinking?!?* he though. He brought one of his large arms up and placed it on her shoulder and was about to push her away when he heard her say something about a clinic. Despite the slight buzz he had from his drink that word clicked, he knew Wes needed some medical attention and if he did a favor for this woman she would owe him. His hand slowly slid down her back and around her waist. He took a breath and straightened up, proving that he was in fact six feet ten inches tall and was two hundred and eighty five pounds of muscle.
He looked at the governor and then back at the woman "Sorry I'm late. I just had to take care of some business that took a little longer than I planed. Anyways about the supplies." he said looking back at the governor "I'm sure we can come to some sort of...agreement" he said slowly, almost threating with the last part "and fairly quickly I hope. I have plans for us tonight." he added as he pulled her slightly closer to his side. "Now I'm sure an intelligent man such as yourself can come to an agreement with beautiful here." he said again in his slightly hostile yet firm tone.

Wes entered the bazaar right behind Callia and Jasper. If one was looking for anything here this was the place to find it. Food, clothing, jewelry. Although not overtly noticeable there was a certain sense of caution in the air. Wes began to pay attention to the merchants. He quickly picked up on the fact that they were keeping tabs on the local Imperial troopers.
Wes looked at Callia. **"Do you know what your looking for in this place?"** It seemed that his question fell on deaf ears though Jasper did rotate once in his direction as if surprised that the Mando actually talked to its master. Shaking his head he simply followed though not before making sure that his carbine was ready to go as it hung between his arm and side.
Almost ahead of them he spotted the sign. **'Thunner's Cloud: Mechanics Emporium and Repair!'**
**"Interesting. If we find anything her I will be surprised."** Almost instantly Callia broke out into song. Some little tune about a power coupling.
***I should have stayed with the others and let him be on his own. Then again he is the only ships mechanic we have right now.***
He continued to walk along right behind the odd little man as he walked the isles. If any vendor got to pushy Wes made sure to make it knows that he was with Callia. Someone had to watch out for him.

Every electronic odd and end assails the senses as Wes and Callia enter the emporium. Flashing diodes, blinking indicator lights, and sparks are found in plentiful supply, and everything has a blinking price tag of some sort or another.
As the mad doctor begins his song, oddly enough many of the droids and mechanical bits in the store begin to join in, providing a chorus that's almost in complete harmony with Callia's tune. When the song trails off there's a round of beeping-clanking-shuddering applause, then all of the collective devices return to their varied states of self-prostitution.
It is during this weird display that one of the protocol droids steps into Wes's path.
**"Excuse me sir, you seem like a well-armed man of discerning tastes! Could I interest you in the latest offerings from BlasTech? Perhaps a new beam emitter or power cycler? Can't have you running out of charge when dispatching your foes, can we?"**
From the few glimpses Wes manages to get around the metallic nuisance, Callia has completely disappeared, although the Mandalorian catches a faint plea of, **"Wait master, wait! Oh please master, wait for me!"**
*******************************************************************************
The *Power Surge's* interior looks like any number of spacer cantina's the Pirate has been to throughout his illustrious career. Dingy, dimly lit, and filled with an ever-present haze of smoke, the *Surge* is sparsely populated at this hour. A handful of Hobben mill about, seeming dazed at such an alien structure marring their jungle world, while a few stormtroopers and Imperial officers idle about. A pair of cloaked figures speak in hushed tones in a darkened corner, but none really lift their attention to the Feeorin and the Besalisk as they enter and tromp over to their own booth.
**"Y'see that tech shop on your way in? That's all me, I'm the only Kwazel Maw in this pond, and it's making me rich!"**
The Besalisk takes a drink in each of his upper hands, while he still uses his lower hands to gesture wildly. His every invective if flecked with beer foam which showers Kurr at regular intervals.
**"Got in when the Hobben were jus' lookin' to make their splash in the galaxy. Been supplyin'm with every scrap of blinky-bits I can get in here, and they pay me in fine goods and rubies the size o' a Rancor's nadgers! Even got maself a spacer junkyard floatin' around the planet's backside, with damn near every rig and wreck you ever seen in the last hunnerd years!"**
Jach slams a beer mug down on the table at his good fortune, 'causing some heads to turn his way. The old scoundrel barely seems to notice as he continues, although he does lean into Kurr and lower his voice in a conspirator fashion.
**"But Ol' Jach ain't selfish, always lookin' for a helpin' hand on the path to riches. I gots me a shipment of Solsian Deepwood I need delivered to a contact; stuff is becomin' the Nerf's knees in the high-fallutin' circles of the Galaxy. Problem is these new Sith-Imps are squeezin' every last drop out of these Hobbie-folk, includin' their commerce, and that means my pocket's takin' a mean pinch!"**
Taking a look around, Jach surreptitiously slides a datapad out of one of his many pockets, and pushes it across the table at Kurr. His voice lowers even further, sounding like a muted bee-buzzing to the Feeorin's ear.
**"If someone were to git ma' shipment off planet and into ma friends hands, that someone would find themselves well compensated fer the troubles. Might even find themselves an even more lucrative deal at the oth' end; got some more friends comin' in here what desperately want their hands on some 'heavy machinery' if ya catch where I'm dustin'. Might ya be bein' that someone?"**
*******************************************************************************
Governor Rothke shrinks away from the Mandalorian, taking a half step back away from the armored warrior. But as he does, he collides with his pair of elite troopers, and feeling them behind him he regains some of his composure.
**"Yes… Uhm, well… D-do carry on. We'll continue our discussion some other time Jakira, I hope you both have an enjoyable evening…"**
The look coming from the pudgy little gentleman is a mixture of extreme jealousy for Jakira, and a promise of a cruel death to Al'verde. He waddles off towards the administrative complex, sparing a few greedy glances back at the pair before he disappears further into the starport.
When the governor is fully out of sight, an Ithorian comes hustling up to Zeltron and the Mandalorian, flanked on one side by a woman (Nestil) that sniffs arrogantly about, and dragging another Zeltron (Rehn) on the other.
**"Oh Jakira, I am so very glad to see you! Was that the governor? I hope he doesn't cause any trouble, particularly any cheese related trouble! I see you've met one of my new friends, I have so very much to tell you!"**
The scatterbrained Ithorian is babbling all over the place in his exuberance, using the full breadth of all 4 of his throats as he doesn't pause to give Jakira a moment to respond. The other Zeltron appears to continually be attempting to interject, but doesn't seem to be able to get a word in edge-wise, while the woman stands with a look of long-suffering impatience.

The young Zeltron woman, still in the strange Mandalorian man's embrace, watches as the corpulent governor rounds the corner. "**What an abhorrent, loathsome, revolting…. sleemo…**" she says under her breath, each word coming out as a curse and a small pause as she works to describe the man's failings. Relief courses through her as she moves out of the man's embrace, she smiles at him and prepares herself for whatever favor the man is going to want for his assistance. Her words are however cut short as Oraltor cuts across the atrium to her.
As the words spill from his mouth in a large gush she takes him into a hug and starts talking over his own tirade, knowing full well she wouldn't get a word in otherwise. "**Oraltor! You're back. How I've missed you! Yes, that's the governor,**" she draws away from the Ithoriain and pauses only a moment to look at her Ithorian friend's other companions. "**Foul creature, doesn't even deserve to be called sentient. He's with you?**" she says under her breath, and with the last motions toward Al'verde with a nudge of her head. "**Anyways we should move out of such a public scene.**" she continues to listen to Oraltor but grabbing his arm, begins to steer him away to a more secluded and private venue. Giving the others a friendly smile as she leads the exuberant Ithorian away, she bobs with head that they should follow.

Kurr listened as he drank his beer, his eye whirring and clicking as he attempted to follow his associate's gestures. Once Thunner mentioned "compensated", a sly grin slide across the Feeorin's mouth. **"Could be possible,"** he replied, attempting to slide the datapad within his grasp without anyone noticing. **"'Course, th' question nae be *'If'*, but rather be *'how much creds'* … I believe yer on th' same page as me, eh, ya ole Kleeg?"** Chuckling as he finished his beer, his mind wandered to the rest of his 'crew' and the idea of sneaking this past them. Kurr wasn't sure how'd he do it, but the prospect of earning decent creds with his own ship was indeed enticing.

Wes followed Callia and Jasper through the emporium. Truth be told nothing really caught the Mando's eye. For the moment he had all he needed. As Callia began to sing Wes moaned. The boy was of his pod racer. What was worse was he fact that many of the other mechanical...devices joined in.
**"This is too much even for me."** His voice sounded out in the throng of people. As if on que a protocol droid steps into his path of following Callia.
"Excuse me sir, you seem like a well-armed man of discerning tastes! Could I interest you in the latest offerings from BlasTech? Perhaps a new beam emitter or power cycler? Can't have you running out of charge when dispatching your foes, can we?"
**"You're in my way."** Wes said matter-of-fact to the droid as he looked passed it's head.
"Surely sir you need something in case your power pack runs dry." He tried to catch sight of Callia but boy had disappeared from sight but not hearing as he heard the faint cries from Jasper. "Wait master, wait! Oh please master, wait for me!"
As Wes pushed passed the droid he spoke. **"If my power pack ran dry I'd just chase it down a pummel it into submission, like the last droid that stopped me."** He caught a glimpse of Jasper and he headed for the droid. About about fifty steps later Wes came to a larger open area filled with vendors and masses of people. Looking around he saw nothing of Callia and Jasper.
**"Karking hell."** Knowing it would prove fruitless to go looking for him by himself the Mandalorian warrior turned and walked back to where he left the others.
He arrived just as they were getting ready to leave. Al was there with the female Zeltron, Nestil, the Itrorian and Rehn. He walked up beside Al. **"That crazy boy ran off. I tried to follow him but by the time I thought I caught up he lost me in a large market. No idea where he went. Nor do I care at the moment. I need a drink and a place to rest. I'm still not fully recovered."** He said as he shifted his carbine and looked around.

Al'verde watched as Governor Rothke walked away and just kept looking back at him as the governor's eye filled with hate *He would flip if he knew what I was packing. Perhaps I'll show him if he comes back to give me any trouble…or if he sends his little friends.* The thought made him chuckle **Ke nu jurkad sha Mando'ade, burc'ya!** he added with a small wave. As the strange woman slipped out of his grip he watched how she greeted Oraltor. He figured that having that connection would help with getting his brother patched up for free. He started to follow her, but that's when noticed that someone else was there. He almost turned with his weapons ready but then noticed it was Wes. He smiled as he wrapped his large arm around Wes's shoulder and laughed at his comment about losing the boy **Su cuy'gar. Well vod that's why they invented mesh tape. Next time we see we can just tape him to my back.** he laughed.
As he followed the others, almost forcing Wes to follow, he pointed out Jakira **"You see that young woman there…she going to fix you up."** he said almost like an older brother setting his younger brother up for a first date **"After that I'll get us some drinks, you can get whatever you want."** he pulled Wes in a bit closer so he could whisper **You just may want to ask her first."**

**"Since I'm in such a givin' mood, I'll wet'cher whistle with five grand now and a full ten large upon successful delivery. That's damn near ten percent of my cut, I'm practically robbin' maself!"**
Thunner punctuates his whispered talk with a loud smack of his prodigious belly, erupting in good-humored chuckling. Kurr's no rookie at this game, he knows that Thunner's likely shorting him for a good deal less than that ten percent, but that's still quite a few creds.
...Too many for a simple blue milk run. The Besalisk extends one of his stubby hands toward the pirate.**"If'n yer not interested, I've'a couple other prospectives lined up that'd love the work. We have an accord?"**
*******************************************************************************
Oraltor allows himself to be dragged along by the good doctor, but just as rapidly as he speaks he halts in his advance and Jakira finds herself trying to pull on a stalled bantha for all the progress she makes.
**"Oooh, I agree we need to speak in private, but I would prefer back at the hospital if we may. There a few… *things* I want do discuss, and some… *stuff* I want to check on. Oh! And there's an… *item* I have to secure first, pardon me a moment!"**
The Ithorian's confiding eyestalk winks after each pause are exaggerated to the point of being comedic, even more so as the Jedi believes the facial expressions necessary to relay his subterfuge. If she doesn't let go of the Ithorian's coat, Jakira will find herself dragged along as Oraltor shuffles back towards the No Chance's docking bay and flags down one of the attendant droids.
After long wait and several boring moments of watching the Ithorian pace, a pair of landspeeder's about a century past their prime pull up before the group, and loaded into the back of one is a rather bulky crate that can't be anything else other than the oubliette. Oraltor comes hustling over from where he had hired the taxi service, and stands wheezing slightly from the effort of walking back and forth.
**"I think all is in order now. Are we ready to depart?"**

Either way, Kurr still had that wild look in his eye.

Promptly releasing the Ithorian when he begins to head back to the ship she sighs as he makes his exaggerated hints. She does follow him, however, curious as to what her scatterbrained friend had been up to. Finally unable to bear the abnormal silence any longer she asks, "**What *have* you been up to?**" Her curiosity only increases upon seeing the large crate. "**Oraltor, darling! You brought me a present! You shouldn't have.**" she says with an elated sarcasm, taking a good look around the crate. "**What is it?**"

"...you just may want to ask her first." Al had pulled him in close so he could whisper. Wes chuckled as he looked the Zeltron over. Beautiful she was with out a doubt.
**"Is she's a doctor I might just let her give me a complete physical."** He said back to the big Mando in the same whisper.
As he began to walk away from the *No Chance* Wes watched as the Ithorian stopped in his tracks. Began to spout about needing something as he heads back to the ship. He followed the eccentric Jedi and the Zeltron Woman who name he heard a moment ago. Moments later he emerged from the ship with a large crate. Wes simply sighed as the sight of the obuliette. ***That thing is gong to haunt me. That and this Jedi prophecy that entails me.***
When she inquired what it was the sarcasm was evident in her voice. ***Present indeed.*** He thought. ***More like a prison.***
He turned his head to look at her. Her pretty face reflected in his helmet. **"What is it you ask. It's what I was asleep in for the past hundred years."** Without saying another word he turned back around and began to walk. **"Yes Oraltor we're ready to go. Remember I still need to be checked over It's been a few years."**

If you need something fixed, piloted, shot, or just taken care of I'm the man for the job."** he said holding out his hand.
As he looked at the speeder he sighed *Are we really riding in the rust bucket? The floor my just fall out from under me with my weight* he thought as his helmet hid the discuss on his face. He looked around a bit looking for something. **"I'll be right back."** he said as he walked off looking around the Bazaar  *there has to be something better than that rust bucket around here.

Jakira's pretty face is alight with confusion as Wes makes his statement. "**You were in sleep in *what***?" she asks in confusion to his back as he walks away. Her thoughts are interrupted by Al'verde as he holds out his hand in introduction. Taking it, her slim hands are enveloped by the Mandalorian's gloved hands. "**Charmed. Doctor Jakira**." she says, her attention still focused on Wes's retreating form.
As Al'verde leaves she approaches Oraltor and pulls him to the side. With her hands on her hips in a no nonsense manner, she asks "**What *is* going on? I want an answer Oraltor! You disappear for months on end, with only a vague explanation and you bring home….. *this*.**" The last word she indicates in exaggerted movements the crew and passengers of the No Chance and the crate.

Thunner spends a long time squinting up at the Feeorin, mumbling a few choice obscenities under his breath. Suddenly he drains the dregs from each of his mugs, slams them on the tabletop, and and then grips Kurr's hand tightly.
**"Fine, fine you ol' treacherous Gundark! An even 20 it is, and you can't ever say Thunner ain't a generous soul!"**
The Besalisk squeezes his girth from out of the cramped little booth as he ambles to his feet, motioning for Kurr to follow him.
**"I've got some more of the particulars back at ma shop. Follow me, and afterwords I can get ya goods loaded."**
After straightening the fit of his overalls, Thunner turns and swaggers out of the cantina, hastily scrabbling through the atrium towards the bazaar.
*******************************************************************************
Al'verde is also almost overwhelmed as a deluge of sites, sounds, and the most *cloyingly* smells, assails his senses as he enters the Bazaar. Goods and services from around the galaxy are on display, and more prominently those indigenous offerings that only the natives of Solsis VII know how to cultivate.
The Mandalorian has no trouble finding Thunner's Bazaar, and is quickly confronted by the same pair of droids that blockaded his brother-in-arms a moment ago. The protocol droids are more than happy to show him the various electronic wares for sale, and with some prompting Al'verde finds himself lead out a back door of the mechanics shop and into a speeder lot/junkyard that stretches nearly one hundred meters. Only a scant few patches of the lot are covered like the rest of the spaceport, so thick sheets of torrential rain pour in through the the tree canopy overhead, making it difficult to fully assess the quality of the vehicle offerings on display.
But one speeder bike in particular catches the mercenary's eye: An old Ikas-Adno 22-B Nightfalcon, limited edition with black powder coat finish and red-striping. The bike was an antique, but rested under one of the few spaces protected from a majority of the rain. Although the weapon emplacement has been stripped and the steering linkage appears loose, the repulsorlift assembly appears in working order and the frame is still strong after all these years.
**"What do you think sir? And it is certainly a great deal at the sales price of 2,750 credits, Imperial Standard. We also offer a tremendous financing program at agreeable interest rates!"**
*******************************************************************************
**"I am sorry doctor, I did not bring any presents back for you on this trip, but I simply must tell you about everything we've been through!"**
Oraltor opens the door to one of the speeders and slides in. After the remaining party filters into the two vehicles, they speed away from the starport and you all (with the exception of maybe Jakira) are left wondering just what it takes precisely to receive one's speeder license on Solsis VII, because it becomes quickly apparent that passenger safety and appreciable avoidance of collisions are decidedly not on the list.
The further you get away from the port, the sooner you leave behind hastily fabricated roads and embark upon highways crafted from the natural weave and intermingling of Solsis VII's dizzying jungle canopy. Flowers of unfathomable variety dangling from dew-dripped vine stalks, putting the few specimens in the well-manicured atrium to shame with their wild and natural beauty. A savage harmony from all manner of beast provides an ambient chorus as the landspeeders continue to wind their way through the jungle maze, and far above multiple insects can be seen buzzing to and fro. The hex-patterned wings of the bugs are perhaps the most striking feature of the whole forest scene: pearlescent gold at first glimpse, as the sparse shafts of light from the Solsian suns filters through the rain-thickened canopy, the wings ignite in color and shift through a spectrum of color, coating the surrounding leaf color in a prism of light.
With the mesmerizing light show performed by the Solsian indigenous flora and fauna, those in the landspeeders barely notice when they arrive before a structure out in the wilderness, the drivers bringing the vehicles to a halt with an abrupt and unceremonious stop.
*******************************************************************************
Jakira's hospital has been setup in the remains of a rehabilitated Hobben temple. While the hospital retains much of its form as an ancient ziggurat, modern plasticrete replaces crumbling stone and mortar while transparisteel framing reinforces the aging Solsian Deepwood bones of the structure. Completing the fusion of the classic and the modern is a repelling barrier made up of ancient Hobben remedies and contemporary pest-shooing methods made to keep all but the most tenacious of vermin away from the hospital grounds.
Hanging garden's and well kept lawns dot the temple's flattened surfaces, while crowning the ziggurat's plateaued roof is a decidedly modernized manor. The Hobben can be seen all over the estate, attending to the grounds, walking the infirm on their road to recovery, and generally carrying out the day-to-day operation of a well-run hospital.
Amazing how much real estate big-city credits can get you on a backwater world.
As the landspeeders approach, Wes can see that those Hobben milling about the front of the property appear to become more tense and alert, but as the landspeeders pass and the Hobben taxi drivers flash the sentries an appropriate series of signals, the mood relaxes and the ashen guardsmen return to their work. When the speeders finally arrive at the Hospital entrance, a small procession of Hobben greets them, with most of the crowd comprised of local healers and patients looking to greet the good doctor.
*******************************************************************************
Standing out amidst the throng is a human male of average height, with a rich brown complexion, close-cut dark hair and dark brown eyes. Slung over one shoulder is a well-worn fringers jacket, while in his hands is a gardening apparatus of some sort. His expression is fairly unreadable, but judging by the sheen of perspiration coating his brow and the tool in his hand, he had been helping out with the hospital's busy work a moment before the group arrives.

After all, this wasn't Kurr's first business dealing, and he was itching to get back to his ship. As he walked through the bazaar, the feeorin's artificial eye clicked and whirred as he looked over the crowd.

In an attempt to keep a good humor with her Ithorian friend she refrains from bombarding the usually rather talkative Jedi with questions about his trip. Instead she to slides into the speeder with her friend and holds on with practiced ease as the Hobben driver takes them to their destination. She keeps up a steady stream of good humored babble, updating her friend on what's been happening since he had left.
"**You won't find the hospital much changed. A bit fuller, though, with how the Hobben have been treated by our Imperial "hosts" it's not too surprising. A large percentage seem to have taken up refuge there.**" She gives a delicate shrug and smiles at Oraltor. "**It's nice to see the place so lively. Of course all the patients and guests have put a strain on our resources, but we've been managing well enough. That blasted governor seems to take some pleasure in sending me only the minimal amount of supplies I request. I've had to resort to local remedies , some of them have actually proven quite effective.**" She babbles on talking of this and that and then stops for a bit as she almost gets tossed from the speeder when the Hobben driver takes a turn too quickly. Growing quiet for the tail end of the ride, she takes in the scenery away from the "civilized" portion of the Solsis jungle.
Leaving the transport behind, Jakira approaches the milling Hobben. Speaking words of encouragement and asking after her patients well being; she has a kind word to give each of them in their own tongue. Stopping to speak to one Hobben in particular, a young woman, she begins giving her a set of instructions. "**Please have guest rooms up in the manor made up, Litasha. Also make sure, friend Oraltor's room is aired. And be a dear and see what can be cooked up for a feast tonight.**" Glancing back at Wes, her lips purse obviously not having forgotten about him. "**I'll also need an exam room prepared.**"
Jakira had been making her way toward the human male as she spoke, the young Hobben woman taking down small notes on a datapad she carries. Reaching up she gives him a kiss on a check in greeting. "**Jareth! Back already and recruited to work. Hope your latest venture proved enlightening.**" Turning back to the young woman she dismisses her with a 'thank you' and looks back to Jareth for a response.

Al'verde looked at the bike and smiled. He didn't answer the droid as he walked over to the bike and ran his hand over the body. He circled the bike almost like a predator circling its pray. He knelt down and inspected the repulsorlift assembly and other mechanical working of the bike. As he stood brushed the dust off his armor he took a deep breath **"Well seeing as how the weapons system has been striped, the steering linkage appears to be loose I think 2,750 is a little high. I think you can take a little off the top there. How about I give you 2,000 right here and now to take it off your hands. It's my only offer, besides if you let me have it for 2,000 I'll be sure to let the rest of my team know where I got this bike. I'm sure a few, if not most of them, would be willing to take a look."** As he spoke he crossed hie arms and leaned back slightly watching the droid.

The young man barely had enough time to pause and wipe the sweat from his brow before the attractive Zeltron kissed him. With cheeks rapidly turning red, Jareth carefully placed the gardening tool on the ground before speaking. "**It went well, for what it's worth. Nothing really to note besides the occasional exotic bird flying overhead. I see you've brought back a few guests**" Slowly he glanced over the group but not before taking a sip of water from his canteen.
"**Jareth Henaru. Traveler, and explorer-for-hire. My journey has recently brought me to this beautiful planet, but I fear I shall just be passing through. Unless I have extra incentive to stay of course**" The scout rubbed his stomach, then looked back to Jakira before rubbing his stomach once more with a grin. "**How did your visit with the governor turn out**?"

Wes entered the cab and took a seat across from the female Zeltron. He was still exhausted. Despite being tired he found himself looking at the attractive female before him. He leaned into the side of the cab where he sat positioning himself so he didn't get rocked around by what passes for a driver of the vehicle. ***At least if we crash I'm wearing my armor. Would suck to be the others back here tough.*** He found a little humor from his thoughts but suppressed a laugh. As the others began to talk he sat there thankful for his helmet as his eyes began to close he found a restless slumber. Either a voice would be raised or the cab would jerk violently at rustle him back to consciousness.
When the speeder came to a abrupt stop Wes shifted and looked out. It wasn't much to look upon at first glance. Getting out of the vehicle he took notice of his surroundings. His Mando training came into play. People, places, defensible positions as well as places that could be trouble. Now that he had a chance to look around the grounds actually looked nice. It was such a stark contrast to what he had experienced during the Vong war. The Vong's terraforming technique was brutal to the previously existing ecosystem. A smile broke the otherwise stoic expression that he had been wearing since he basically woke up back on the wheel.
His audio receptors picked up Jakira talking. She was having things made ready for them. Rooms and food. ***That may mean a real meal and a bed.*** He thought to himself.
He saw Jakira glance to him her lips purse as if in thought. "I'll also need an exam room prepared."
The smile continued. **"Your the Doctor. Al said you would see to it that I got checked out. I guess I didn't realize you would be the one doing the checking."** He said as he watched her give a kiss to a one of the gardeners who introduced himself as Jareth Henaru.
The Mando nodded **"Wes Del-Fin"**
He turned from Jareth to Jakira as he wasn't particularly interested in making friends at that moment. He wanted to be checked out and feed his stomach with some real food that wasn't ships rations. **"Well Jakira where's that exam room. I've been in a suspended state for a hundred years give or take a few. Getting checked over might be a good idea followed with some of that food you mentioned."**
He let the carbine hang from its shoulder strap as he reached up and grabbed his helmet. With a twist he removed it and tucked it under his left arm. With it off those that didn't see him in his birthday suit before saw his face. A younger face with short light brown hair and a few days worth of stubble lined his face. Dark brown eyes, that were bright but weary, looked around and saw the faces of those that were near.
**"I feel terrible."**

Jakira turns her attention to Wes as he approaches and introduces himself. When he removes his helmet, she gets her first real look at him. Smiling kindly at Wes, she resisted the urge to say he looked as bad as he probably felt. "**Yes, of course.**" She glances around for Litasha, realizes the young woman most likely went to see about preparations so instead motions over one of the other healers. "**Would you please show Mr. Del-Fin to an exam room,**" she says to the Hobben healer and then turns back to Wes. "**I'll be there shortly.**"
As Wes is lead off she turns back to Jareth and the others. "**You know you're always welcome here Jareth. And if a good meal and a warm bed isn't enough to keep you hear, I'm sure I can think of something,**" she says with a wink and wry smile. To the others she adds, "**Please make yourselves comfortable. Rooms should be made ready shortly. Would you mind giving them a tour, Jareth dear?**" Not waiting for any response she reaches up again to give him a kiss on the cheek in thanks and heads off after Wes and the healer with a soft lighthearted giggle.

## Re: Chapter 2: Way Down in the Jungle Deep

### **Anazider** (2010-07-25 00:52:19)

Kurr accompanies Thunner back to the besalisk's shop unmolested, but the desperation in the air is almost palpable. Evidence of the Sith Empire's heavy hand is everywhere, and the Hobben that the pirate comes across look like a proud, wild people straining under an oppressive yoke.
When they arrive at the shop, Kurr is finally assailed, but this time by the sights and sounds of a garish advertising campaign run amuck as the droids leap into his path selling him things. They part to allow Thunner to pass untouched, but quickly regroup around the Feeorin until he is deep in the store and has sufficiently swatted them out of the way.
As the pirate follows Thunner to the store's back offices, out of the corner of his eye he catches site of someone through one of the store's side doors: a tall, armored figure that appears to be arguing with another sales droid. After a bit of focusing with his mechanical eye, Kurr can make the figure out as Al'verde, one of the comrades that had accompanied him in their escape from the Wheel.
Thunner holds the door open for Kurr and then locks it behind the pirate. The furnishings are fairly lavish, although its nearly impossible to tell under the mounds of clutter. Piles of flimsiplast, datapads, contracts and the like are scattered throughout the office, which the Besalisk constantly rearranges with his girth as he shuffles through the confined space. Making his way over to his desk, he rifles through a stack of datapads before he gets to the one he's lucking for and tosses it to Kurr.
**"Contact is on Rathalay in the Mid-Rim, goes by the name Silk. Drop off the payload, get yer creds, maybe get some mo' work, and we'll all be rich eh?"**
The Besalisk then hunkers down behind his desk, and what follows is a series of clicks, whistles, and beeps that would lead the Feeorin to believe that Thunner has more security on his personal safe than the First Galactic Bank on Coruscant. A credit chit comes flying over the desk towards the pirate, and a quick scan shows it is for the full five grand.
Thunner's as good as his word.
*******************************************************************************
**"I am sorry sentient, I am not allowed to haggle or barter the prices of our goods or services. Such is at the discretion of our establishment's owner, Thunner. Ah, and it appears you are in good fortune, for the master has returned."**
Following the line of the protocol droid's silvered arm, Al'verde can see a squat Besalisk being tailed by a tall Feeorin through the door leading back into the shop. The Besalisk is unfamiliar, although the Mandalorian remembers him *hugging* the pirate back in the starport. The Feeorin is, of course, Kurr, and the both of them soon disappear out of sight deeper into the store's recesses.
*******************************************************************************
**"Yes Doctor."**
The response from the Hobben woman is lilting and accented, although the Basic is fluid enough and very understandable. Litasha sweeps back into the hospital, gesturing to various attendants along the way and issuing Jakira's requests. Oraltor hops out of the taxi and appropriates a few of the labors in the area to help him secure the casket-in-a-crate, and carry into the hospital's depths.
The interior of the hospital is just as much a synthesis of Hobben styling and contemporary galactic structure as many of the hospital's design takes cues from the ancient ziggurat structure, but the latest in technology adorns every room. A cheerful, attractive young Hobben woman mans the greeting desk at the front and an examination room is quickly made ready for Wes.
Oraltor detours, and following him takes you to a large storage area full of medical supplies and other necessary reserves. The Ithorian begs for everyone to halt, and then disappears around a tall stack of portal med-beds. Shortly afterwards, a grating noise, like stone-on-stone can be heard, and a faint rumbling in the stone felt, and then Oraltor reappears and beckons for those accompanying him to follow. Rehn is almost attached to the Ithorian's hip, and Nestil looms behind him like a shadow as they follow the Jedi down into a recessed passageway that was not visible before.
*******************************************************************************
Jakira's house on top of the ziggurat is the quintessential luxurious country villa, with rich marble columns, gorgeous hanging gardens, and the latest in modern appliance. There are five fully furnished rooms, each with its own refresher unit, and a sixth master bedroom complete with its own multi-person jacuzzi tub. All of the bedrooms center around a cozy, and plushly-furnished hearth room, while off the back of the communal room is a large kitchen with gourmet appointments.
With the doctor returning, the cook fires are in full swing and a savory aroma wafts from the kitchen, spicy and decadent.

Kurr grins as he takes the credit chit and slides it smoothly into his pocket. **"Well, I'll say this, yer a rancor after me own heart, Thunner ol' friend. I'll tell ye what, next time I be in town, we'll have t' catch up more over sum drinks. Oh, by th' by … that boyo out there in th' armor, he's one o' me mates.

Jakira is as good as her word. Not keeping her patient waiting long, she knocks on the door to the room before entering. Her usual attire is covered by a clean white wrap around smock which comes down to her knees and is cinched at the waist. Now in "doctor mode" her expression is more serious, her lighthearted attitude transposed by her ethics for her profession and passion. Carried in her hand is her usual tool, the medisensor.
Shutting the door behind her, she gives him a small smile. "**Now then, you've mentioned you were in hibernation..**" she says, getting right down to business. Approaching him, she sweeps the device over Wes to collect a summary of his vital signs and gain an idea on his current condition. "**How long ago did you awaken and how long were you in hibernation?**" Giving him a moment to answer she glances at the readouts. She then asks, "**What sort of symptoms have you been experiencing? Any loss of vision? Hearing? Hypersensitivity?**"

The young man gives a loud sigh as Jakira departs. "**Right. Guess I will be your own personal designated tour guide…Where are you going**?" Jareth frowns as his tour group rapidly follows behind the fleeting Ithorian. Suspicion winning over his cautious nature, Jareth trails the group. He halts near the storage area as he feels a low rumble emitting from somewhere within the large room. The traveler enters the room with astonishment evident on his face. "**Well. This definitely wasn't here this morning**". With a hand near his rifle, Jareth walks into the gloomy darkness of the passageway ahead.

He resisted the urge try and simply break the door down as he took another deep breath and knocked on the door. This was one salesman he was not going the threaten into getting his way. He glanced over at the bike and thought about it for a moment before getting ready to knock on the door. Just as he turned to knock he noticed Kurr coming out and had to pull his fist back to keep from planting in Kurr's face. **"Oh Kurr think I could talk to your friend for a moment?"** he asked as he opened the door so he could look in.
As he looked at the Besalisk he allowed Kurr to step out before steeping **"There was a bike out there that I wanted to buy. Your droid seems dead set on selling it for 2,750.

"Yes Doctor." The girl said.
Wes followed the young attractive Hobben girl as she leads him away from the others. Despite being as tired as he is the attractiveness of the one he followed wasn't lost on him. He was tired not dead. He was going to try and talk with the girl but figured that in his current state even if he was successful he'd be asleep before the action got started.
He looked around at the surroundings. It appeared that the Zeltron, Jakira did pretty well for herself. The hospital had an ancient look to it. ***Kind of like me.*** He thought as he noticed what seemed to be technology in every room he passed. **"Seems that the hospital does well for itself."** He said to the young woman as they approached a front desk which was also attended by another attractive Hobben woman. **"I could start to like this place."** He said under his breath.
"This way Mr. Del-Fin. An exam room is being made up for you right now." He watched as the woman behind the desk was typing into a pad which he figured was letting someone know he was coming.
Moments later he was lead into a comfy yet sterile looking room. A few things adorn the walls but they are there merely for aesthetic. reasons.
Wes turned to look at the young woman again. "The Doctor will be in to see you soon." She begins to turn to leave but Wes stops her with a question.
**"Would it be possible to get some clothes, undergarments also. I'm not exactly dressed in here."** The girl paused and game him a cute smile as she looked him in the face.
**"I will see to it that you have some thing to wear."** She quickly stepped out the smile still on her face. Wes set his carbine down on the exam bed as he looked around. He was never far from it. It had saved his life more then once. Today was one of those times. Systematically he began to take his armor off. By the time the Hobben girl returned he had removed the upper portion of the armor.
She placed the clothes on the exam bed. **"Will you need anything else Mr. Del-Fin?"** He looked at her and did his best to smile. ***If only I felt better.*** He shook his head. **"Not at the moment. Thank you."** Nodding she glanced at Wes noticing that despite the armor his body still held numerous scars. The door closed and Wes went to work on the rest of the armor removing it piece by piece. Finally he grabbed the under garment and put it on. He was just finishing pulling it on as he heard a knock on the door as it opened. Jakira entered as he turned around. If she thought he looked bad before now his whole body looked weary not just his eyes.
She was dressed different now. No not different just a smock that covered up all the good things that he had seen from her earlier. In her hand was a mediscanner.
He sat on the exam bed as she smiled. "Now then, you've mentioned you were in hibernation.."
He nodded to the question as she sweeps the scanner over his body. "How long ago did you awaken and how long were you in hibernation?"
**"I awoke about 9 hours ago. As far as how long I was in hibernation?"** He shrugged. **"I'm not sure exactly. A hundred years give or take. The Vong war hadn't been over for long, four to five months maybe."**
"What sort of symptoms have you been experiencing? Any loss of vision? Hearing? Hypersensitivity?" He chuckled at the question that she hit on the head.
**"Yes, no, kind of. My vision seems to be back. My hearing is fine. I'm sore all over. It doesn't help that I got stabbed in the shoulder either. Ever have one of those days?** He looked at he before he continued. **"Some mad Jedi puts me into hibernation and then I wake up on this place called the wheel. By the time it's all said and done I've killed a half dozen people, give or take, by the time we got off that station. The whole time the Ithorian is so happy to see that I'm alive and that obuliette is in one piece."** He just shakes his head in confusion. The weariness shows in his actions. **"I'm out of place and out of time it seems."**

Jakria nods, not batting an eye during the entire examination that she had caught him only in his undergarments, "**A great deal has changed since the Vong wars…. I'll be sure to get you some historical material you can peruse during your recovery.**" Sliding the scanner easily into her pocket she moves toward Wes. "**It sounds like you had mild symptoms for as long as a sleep you had. Consider yourself fortunate. Now lets take a look at your shoulder.**" With skilled, deft hands she looks over the wound. Satisfied a piece of the blade didn't get stuck within the wound, she approaches a series of cabinets, opening one, she bends over as she gathers an array of materials from bandages to swabs.

### **Yogi** (2010-07-26 12:44:52)

Wes nodded as Jakira spoke about things changing since the Vong war. He found himself agreeing. ***Yeah, the Jedi Order is no longer, Imperial Jedi are now running around along with Sith. Oh yeah I've come to a better time all right.***
He looked at her as she slid the scanner in her pocket. "It sounds like you had mild symptoms for as long as a sleep you had. Consider yourself fortunate. Now lets take a look at your shoulder." Quickly and adeptly her hands works on his shoulder. She was well practiced in her profession he noted.
The knife wound wasn't bad the attacker wasn't with it at the time of the attack. **"The guy who did this to me had gone over the edge and lost his grip on things. His attack wasn't very good. Thought that may have something to do with me dropping his woman he was after."** He shrugged which brought a wince of pain and discomfort.
She had turned around and Wes had thought he might have said something wrong but only she her go to the cabinets. She opened one and bent over to retrieve a few things. The Mando smiled. Despite what she was wearing it did little to hide what was underneath. **"Nice setup you have here Jakira."** The smile was still there when she turned around.

Jakira looked up and over her shoulder at the Mandalorian, a wry smile crossing her face as she notices Wes appreciating her. Standing with a tray of materials she brings it over to rest on a cart. "**Liking what you see?**" she asks, the grin still there, but now more subdued. With a pair of gloves on she takes some gauze and some foul smelling chemical she begins the process of the wound. "**This place was a ruin when I came here. It's not much, simple in comparison to some of the hospitals you'd find in the inner rims, but it's mine… It's taken a lot of work to get it where it is now and up until the Sith Empire came here, things were beginning to break even. Now its all I can do to make sure the Hobben survive long enough to keep their planet.**" She gives a small shrug as she finishes cleaning the wound and picks up a jar. A blue colored substance resided within. With a small wooden tool she began to smear it over the wound and then pressed the edges close.

Wes noticed the wry smile that crosses her face when she caught him looking at her. Then again it wasn't like he was hiding it. "Liking what you see?" She said as she placed the tray on the cart bedside the exam bed.
He chuckled a bit. **"I have hibernation sickness, it's not like I'm dead."** He replied to her question. Her smile subdued, but stayed present, as she began working again on his knife wound. The foul small of one of things made his nose wrinkle as she worked it. She spoke of the place and how well it was beginning to turn out till the Sith came.
***Again with the Sith. Jedi. Sith. Where there's one there is the other. Blast them all to hell for all I care. Prophecy or not.*** At the mention of the Sith he grumbled something under his breath.
"...Now its all I can do to make sure the Hobben survive long enough to keep their planet." He nodded. What she was doing here was noble. More than what some others would be doing in a time like this. That he could understand. he winced a tad as she applied some sort of blue substance to his wound.
**"In the speeder over here I heard mention of this Governor who has been giving you problems. Al may have already offered but I'm sure that a pair of Mandalorians running interference for you might have a beneficial effect on whats happening here. Often times its the threat of violence that gets the pigheaded and greedy to listen."** He looked at Jakira. He had a new found respect for the woman. She wasn't just a pretty face. He looked at his shoulder and moved it. The work she had done combined with whatever medicine she used had taken much of the pain away.
**"Talented hands you have there Doctor."** He said with the same grin he had just a few moments ago. ***One can only wonder if they have other talents as well. At least she's turning your mood around.***
**"So whats the prognosis? Have any good remedies?"** Just a hint of his smile remained as he was mostly serious with his question. Mostly.

With the blue glue applied to the wound, Jakira started wrapping it carefully with the clean bandages before he could move it a lot. "**Don't move it too much or you'll dislodge the glue,** she rebukes him when he starts doing the opposite. "**You should be able to move it normally in a few hours once it sets. Keep it dry till the wound heals, the glue will be absorbed and aid in the healing.**"
At the mention of the governor, Jakira's nose wrinkled as if she smelled something rotten. "**He's just a perverted, man who thinks throwing his weight around will get him what he wants. I might have only made things worse, but Al has already helped me out, though he may not realize it yet.**" Securing the bandage she gave him a smile again "**The governor has a murderous streak so I hope Al can handle him. I wish I could say the governor is cowed by a couple Mandalorians, but with the might of his Empire behind him, I fear violence will only make things worse for the Hobben.**"
She tossed her used gloves into a reciptical and then handed him the rest of the clothes she indicates he should dress now. "**My prognosis is that you need a good nights sleep and some food, both of which I can provide ample of.**" With a sly grin she begins to undo the ties cinching her smock around her waist. "**Anything else is of course a bonus.**"

### **Yogi** (2010-07-26 19:28:42)

When Jakira told him about the blue glue and not to move it too much he simply nodded in understanding.
At his question about the Governor he watched as she wrinkled her nose like he did moments ago. She had nothing good to say about the man. A power hungry individual who would use what even means to achieve his the ends he wanted. It didn't help that he had considerable backing.
His smile faded as he looked at the seriousness in her features when she spoke. He realized that the years hadn't changed anything. Evil men were still evil. That was never going to change.
She tosses her gloves onto the garbage reciptical and then handed him his clothes which he tool with the uninjured side. He stared to dress. "My prognosis is that you need a good nights sleep and some food, both of which I can provide ample of." That grin of hers came back that could make even a Mandalorian pause as she started to remove the smock that was attacked at her waist. "Anything else is of course a bonus."
His grin returned at her anything but subtle play of words. **"Sometimes the bonus is all that matters."** He said right back to her as he pulled on some dark gray pants. He reached for the shirt which was a pull over. The size wasn't quite right but it went on without much trouble. While he wasn't as big and overly muscled as Al but his physique was in great form.
His grin dropped a bit some seriousness returned to his voice. **"I know what you did for me cost you. It could have been used on the Hobben instead of me. I don't have and creds for payment. What I can offer is my services. While I'm here in your care if anyone comes causing trouble I'll be here to see that they are sent away one way or another."** He paused quickly as the grin returned and gave her a wink. **"Anything else is of course a bonus."**
He looked at the door and then back to her **"Now about that food."**. He said as his stomach rumbled.

Jakira returns the grin as she finishes taking her smock off and throws it over her arm. "The Hobben generally pay me in trade or work so that wont be an issue." With him now dressed she heads toward the door out. " Shall we? I'm certain there will be food waiting for us in the manor."
When and if he goes to collect the armor she shoos him toward the door. "I'll send someone to collect it. Come on."

He nodded at the offer of food. Food and rest is what he needed. First the food then the rest. He turned to grab his armor but she stopped him and actually shooed him towards the door. "I'll send someone to collect it. Come on."
He looked from her to his armor. His armor was his life and it had save him more times than he could count. If the good doctor was watching him she could see him weighing the issues. Rarely was he without it yet in his current state he was really too tired to put it back on much less carry it piece-mail . He nodded but stepped back to the exam table and grabbed his carbine. He was never without his weapon. He slung it over the good shoulder and stepped towards the door.
Stepping out he could smell the food already. "I guess I'll follow my nose." The thought about food seemed to invigorate him as he walked with more strength to where the smell of food was leading him.

Thunner hastily secures his safe behind its very many protections as the Mandalorian barges in, grumbling under his breath the whole time.
**"I'm beset on all sides by brigands, blah! Hasn't this ol' son of a sarlacc taken enough from me already!"**
The old Besalisk scrabbles to his feet with a roar before dusting both sets of hands on his stained overalls and planting them firmly on top of his desk. Slowly, a devious smile creeps across his wide, rubbery lips as he eyes Kurr and Al'verde.
**"Tell yer what… Since I am *such* an agreeable sort, I'll let ya have that bike Click-Clack,"** He nods to Al'verde, **"Right this instant in fact, but the full price's'a comin' out of the end take for the job. Pleasure doing business with you gentlemen, have a good eve!"**
All the Feeorin and the Mandalorian manage to see is a wink from the wiley old Besalisk before Thunner presses something under his desk and the door to his office slams soundly shut and locks with a series of clicks more impressive than when he unlocked his safebox. As they return to the main shop area, the same sales droid that Al'verde had haggled with earlier is awaiting him with the speeder bike's ignition key, while a trio of rusty Gonk droids preps the speeder to some degree of showroom shine.
*******************************************************************************
The trip back to the No Chance is uneventful, as most of the atrium and the bazaar hawkers have cleared out. Although it is becoming late into the evening, the surroundings still seem somewhat sparse with denizens and the few Hobben starport patrols lurking around are bereft of their naval trooper accompaniments.
As Kurr enters the bay where the No Chance is being held, he comes upon a pair of heavy lifting droids loading his cargo. Several massive pallets loaded with rich, dark hardwood are lifted, rolled, and shuffled onto the patrol boat as the hodge-podge loader droids go about their work. Everything appears to be in order and there's still not a customs agent or member of port authority in sight.
*******************************************************************************
The recessed hallway resolves itself into a hidden set of stairs leading into the darkened bowels of the temple. As Oraltor and the Hobben carrying the oubliette tromp down the stairs, glowrods in hidden sconces activate, providing dim guiding light as they procession spirals down into the hidden depths. Before long, the stairs bottom out into an expansive basement that one half the Ithorian has converted into a lab, while the other half functions as living quarters.
A treasure trove of ancient texts, diagrams, and scrolls lines almost every visible surface of the lab, a testament to what the Ithorian had managed to save before the destruction of the Jedi Temple on Ossus. Artifacts of all sizes, mostly Hobben in origin, lean against walls, hang from the ceiling, or nestle in carefully crafted displays. Oraltor flits around the would-be musuem like a nurse-maid tending to an infant ward, moving with a great deal more dexterity than ever he has exhibited before.
While one half of the basement is preoccupied with Oraltor's lab and collection, the other half is cordoned off as a living area, but instead of space befitting an eclectic Jedi Historian the domicile is dominated by almost two dozen Hobben. About half of those gathered are in their middling to advanced years and mostly dressed in traditional garb, while the rest very in age from newly ambulatory toddlers to crones bowed so heavily by age to as nearly be bent double. At their center is a tall, well-built Hobben who appears to be just shading past their prime. Judging by the revered looks almost all of the Hobben give this man, he must be the Voice of the Ali'la.
The Voice and his people turn warily to the entrance as it is opened, and upon seeing the Jedi they all visibly slacken. Their looks become ones of curiosity as a pair of there bretheren follow behind the Ithorian with their heavy package, and as the handlers lay the crate on an examination table the Voice mutters a few hasty words in their native tongue before he and the gathered Elders move to huddle around the crated oubliette.
**"The Ali'la sings of you Jareth Henaru. We had word that strangers approached, and so we came down to the archive. Is there trouble? What wonder has the *Jebradai* brought with him now, hm?"**
Deep and sonorous, the Voice speaks as fluently as if Basic was his first language. As he addresses Jareth, the other council Elder's greet the scout with a mixture of warm smiles and barely-tolerated nods, while many of the children gathered babble and bubble about the tall human, some knowing him from his help in their rescue and security.
Oraltor, for his part, has all but forgotten his audience as he goes around removing the press-board crate with a hammer and chisel. As the crystal casket is revealed, a buzzing chatter begins amongst the Hobben with speculation as to what the oubliette is and what it may contain. The Ithorian extracts a handful of tools from a nearby workbench and greedily sets to work analyzing and inspecting the Jebble box, seeking to tease out the rest of its secrets. This whole time Nestil has stood in stoic silence while Rehn's quietude is anything but, as he impatiently taps his foot and shifts too and fro while the historian goes about his work.
*******************************************************************************
The smell of roasting meats and cooking fires permeates the halls of the Temple, beginning as a teasing hint near the examination rooms and growing in pungency the closer the hospital's occupants come to an exit. As the summit of the ziggurat is gained, Wes and Jakira see roasting pits, cooking cauldrons, and preparations tables lining the well manicured landscape of the doctor's front lawn.
Spicey and sweet, smokey and savory, a cornucopia of sights and smells greets the Mandalorian and the Zeltron as they wade ever deeper into the feasting area. It would appear that the Hobben are intent on creating enough food to satiate all that would attend the feast, and then some. As Jakira and Wes pass each station, tastings of each fair are sliced off, scooped up, or ladled out for the pair's approval, the Hobben not taking no for an answer until delicacy is sampled.
Judging by the increased activity at the vermin screens surrounding the compound, and the greater cacophony of noise in the nearby Jungle, hungry sentients aren't the only ones being drawn to the gathering.

Al'verde was slightly confused by what had just happened, but as he saw the bike he really didn't care. He walked up to the bike and ran his hand over the body, like a pilot getting to know his ship for the first time, before hopping on it and starting it up. It wasn't the greatest sound in the world, but it was a sound he knew all to well. Something pushed past its limits but refused to die. It reminded him of himself. He had lost count of the number of time he was sure he would die, yet he always found a way to dig deeper and find the strength to pull though. As the bike rose into the air he looked around and realized that no one had given him directions to where they were headed. With a heavy sight he thought about heading back to the ship, but also wanted to try out his bike.
He finely looked around again and clicked on his comlink and flips it to the No Chance **"Hey Kurr, It's Al'verde. I'm heading out to test my new bike *Bad Company* and see about getting a job or something. Let me know if you need any help or hear from the others."** As he slowly pulled out of the shop he looked around for a spot that he might be able to test out the bike, and get some paint so he can add the bikes new name to the body.

Kurr chuckled as he walked into the cargo bay. *Good ol' Thunner,* he thought, *Always quick on the gun.* Walking up to one of the droids, the pirate asked, **"'Ey, either o' you buckets got th' manifest fer this cargo, eh? I'd like t' get things checked in sooner than later."** He waited patiently for the info, and looked forward to getting it into the *No Chance's* system. *Sooner this happens, sooner I can get moving,* he considered.
Hearing ship's comm squawk with Al'verde's voice, Kurr punched up the conversation. **"Jus' keep in mind that yer little squat-runner there comes outta yer cut, Mate. We should gather up here soon an' start makin' dust, if ya gets me, eh?"** He didn't wait for Al to respond, heading back to check over the final bits of cargo. As soon as it was all in, the feeorin quickly closed the cargo plank, making sure the bay was locked down before starting to look over the course.
Kurr's just looking over the course and possibly plotting it if he has a few moments. Better to have the route plotted before take off and all.

Jakira pauses to take in the smells bombarding her senses as she leaves the confines of the hospital. Her hands clap together in joy at the sight of all the delicious food. Dragging Wes from station to station, she insists he tries a sample of everything. It’s not long till she’s gathered a platter herself of almost every food being offered. Platter in hand she leads Wes to a comfortable patch of grass to sit and enjoy the feast. The position offers a good view of the activity on the lawn.
She pauses a moment as she finally notices the cacophony from outside the hospitals barriers. “**I hope the fauna don’t become an issue tonight. Would be horrible if they ruined a good party.**” Looking around she tries to spot Litasha among the Hobben gathering on the lawn and failing to find her by those means pulls out her commlink to page her Hobben assistant. To Wes she adds, “**I hope someone’s had the good sense to take measures.**”

"**Voice**" The explorer gave a nod to the man as a greeting. Jareth scratched his head and surveyed his surroundings. He then greeted each one of the Hobben men and children in return before addressing the Voice of Ali'la. "**I was going to give the Ithorian and his friends a tour of the hospital, so I trailed them here.**" The young man smiled and rubbed the head of a nearby Hobben child.
"**Uh, where is *here* exactly? Don't think i've seen any of this before.**"

Kurr finds that Rathalay is situated at the center of the near-arm of the Mid-Rim. Close enough to the Corellian Run to discourage most pirate activity and remote enough to be considered "kitsch-y" by the wealthy trendsetters of the galaxy, from Solsis VII a trip to Rathalay would take the better part of two days.
Although hideous amalgamations of junk parts and electronics, the loader droids complete their task with a surprising efficiency, leaving the No Chance's cargo bay neatly stacked with it's new cargo.
*******************************************************************************
The starport is made for ship landing's and visitor reception, and as such doesn't provide avenues for Al'verde to race through. Likewise, the only place nearby that does *any* sort mechanical work is Thunner's shop, and with the erstwhile shop owner holed-up in his office, that would leave the Mandalorian's paint job in the hands of the twitchy GONK droids.
With the atrium mostly empty and many of the bazaar's patrons packing up mysteriously early, the Mandalorian has little to no luck of finding additional employment. Most of the Hobben scatter or cower in seeing the massive, armored warrior lumbering towards them, or buzzing around the mid-sized starport on his loud speederbike.
*******************************************************************************
Wes continually attempts to get a word in with the Doctor, but at each opportunity when he opens his mouth he finds some manner of foodstuff of drink shoved into it. Despite the countless battles and skirmishes the Mandalorian has lived through, nothing has been so dizzying to him as having been lead around by the arm by Jakira.
When at last the good doctor leads the both of them to an unoccupied strip of lawn, Wes finds himself all but stuffed to the gill's. Jakira, being a testament to the incredible Zeltron metabolism, still has a full plate and is picking at it as she delights in the company. Soon after paging her assistant, Litasha exits from the crowd and greets the pair with a slight bow.
**"How can I be helping doctor?"**
*******************************************************************************
**"*Here* is one of this temple's hidden archives, but we have converted it into a shelter for those of my people touched by the Ali'la and our greatest artifacts… Or at leas those we could rescue from the clutches of the Sihth'ebradai."**
The Voice frowns darkly and so do those Elders gathered around him, the injustices the Sith have inflicted upon these proud people weighing heavily upon them. Jareth knows that the Sith have been taking those force sensitive Hobben they find for "Re-education", and those remaining that refuse to grovel before their new overseers are forced to work in the Solsian mines and lumber yards. All for the glory of Dark Lord Krayt.
*******************************************************************************
Oraltor continues to flutter around the oubliette with many a muted "Ooo!", "Aaah!", and "Fascinating!" until he comes across a particular impression on the size of the crystal casket. There are a multitude of impressions and symbols forming a border along the side of the casket, many are recognizable as insignias and characters of agencies long past, like the Old Republic and Vader's Empire, while some are barely recognizable and most others remain unknown.
The Ithorian's eyes grow wider by the moment as he fishes in a pocket of his robe for something. Fumbling, Oraltor produces a crystalline object similar in consistency to the casket, although the base is formed into some symbol that no one else in archive recognizes. He begins to gesture to the others to take some steps away from his work table.
**"I don't know how the oubliette will respond when I introduce the *Akaan'e* holocron. I would advise you all to take cover."**
Many of the Hobben, familiar with the Jedi's experiments, immediately begin to take cover wherever they can find it, although the Voice and the Council of Elders stand firm. Nestil grunts to herself as she places her hands on her hips and leans forward in a leering posture, while Rehn wear's a squeamish grin as he edges slightly behind the Imperial Knight.
Oraltor slides the crystal into the impression, which is now obviously an enclosure meant to house the crystal, until it seats itself with a slight click. A sharp hiss issues from the casket, causing even the Elders and the Imperial Knight to falter in their confidence if only briefly, and then snaking tendrils of compressed air escapes the casket as it begins to transform. The lid of the casket fractures into several interlocking pieces, each portion sliding into the bed of the casket, while multiple panels within the oubliette's lining retract to reveal several light emitters hidden behind them.
Suddenly, shafts of light lance out from each of the emitters, meeting at a single focal point at a height some two meters above the casket. Moving in concert with one another, the beams of light begin to print the outline of a man, etching him in the minutest detail. In the span of a held breath being exhaled, the lasers fully develop the holographic image of a Mandalorian, although the armor and vestments the Mandalorian wears appear to be even more ancient than Wes's. More curious than the armor is what appears to be an ignited lightsaber held in one of his armored hands, while the other holds an archaic warsword.
The Mandalorian turns to survey those gathered around him, his gaze focusing on Jareth, Oraltor, and Nestil before finally settling on the Voice as their leader.
***"Gar ner Mando'ade… A'gar ner Jetiise ner. Val'gar dar'manda?"***
A stunned silence permeates the area, only punctuated by the hum of the expectant hologram hovering above the remains of the casket. The Voice looks to Oraltor and Jareth to interpret the strange language, but all the Hobben receives by way of answer is a squeal of childish delight from the Ithorian.

Kurr let out a knowledgeable **"Hmph"** as he looked over the information on Rathalay. Thinking on it for a moment, he switched over to diagnostics and checked over the status of the ship. Grumbling a bit to himself, the Feeorin walked down the gangplank and into the docking area, pulling his comlink to his lips. **"Oi,"** he said over the comm as he connected to Al'verde. **"Meet me at th' ship, Mate. I'll be needin' sum help … and I think it'll be yer kinda sport, eh?"** Once the message was sent, he clicked the comm over to the Port Authority, saying. **"Oi! Anyone there?

Wes followed as Jakira took him by the arm and lead him from the exam room. **"You know I could get used to this."** He said with a hint of humor as she lead him outside the hospital where the sent of cooking foods caught his attention. It was then that his stomach responded rather violently with it rumblings that even Jakira had heard them. He watched her delight as she took in the scene of the many food stuffs that were being prepared.
Lead to the food they each began to fill up the plates that they each had taken. As he tried to talk with her he found that each time he opened his mouth to talk she was shoving food into it with a, "Oh try this." Or, "This is a delicious local drink." It didn't take long before his stomach that was complaining of being empty just a few short moments ago was now starting to complain of being full and he still had a full plate. Despite his previous experiences this was one of the more whirlwind yet satisfying ones of note.
With plates full they found a nice patch of grass to pull up and claim as their own. Looking around Wes nodded as it afforded a good view of the surrounding area. **"Good spot. It affords a wide range of view."** He saw her nod as she looked out and maybe explained because of his comment. “I hope the fauna don’t become an issue tonight. Would be horrible if they ruined a good party.”
He raised an eyebrow as he followed her gaze to the outer edge of the barriers. “I hope someone’s had the good sense to take measures.”
He managed to take another bite of something Jakira had given him a name for as it had tasted quite good. **"What do you mean?"** He didn't get a answer as she had spotted her assistant and motioned for her to come over. Litasha seemed to find them easily where they sat. She offered them a slight bow. "How can I be helping doctor?"
It was then that Wes began to zone out. The hand on his good arm went out to support him as he experienced an odd sensation. He was swept up in a furious battle like one never seen before. The feeling begins to ebb as quickly as it began. Still some of the feelings seem to hold on. Power calls out from below, beneath the temple.. Other sensations are felt seemingly from beneath his position that he and Jakira occupy. One other sensation is noticeable. He looks at Jakira eyebrow raised, oddly enough one of the sensations is coming from Jakira.
He raised the hand he used for support to touch his would that she had just treated. **"Not sure what you used in your medicine Jakira but has it been known to cause hallucinogenic sensations?"** He looked under neath him and back to the beautiful Doctor. The look on his face had said enough, he wasn't sure what was going on or what he had felt.

Jakira relaxes in the grass, laying on one side with an arm propping her head up. Pausing in her meal she too glances around the perimeter. "**Oh, everything should be fine…**" Interrupted by Litasha she's glad to see her assistant arrive. The last thing Jakira wants is for her patient to end up in a fight in his current state, toughened warrior or not.
"**Litasha dear, have you made sure to increase the perimeter guard and the barriers?**" she asks casually, trying not to alarm Wes any further than she has. "**I…**" Her words slur as she feels a sudden burst of light headiness and loss of all sensation. The dizzying moment leaves her speechless as she tries to comprehend what had just happened, never having been prone to fits of fainting. Not wanting to make more of a scene as she already has, she attempts the resist the urge to brush her skin to ward off the tingling sensation as if an army of ants were crawling up her skin.
Finally she looks up into the face of her assistant and gives her a dismissal, warding off any concern the young woman may express. Slolwly she says to her, in attempt to keep her voice calm. "**Thank you, Litasha. Please see to the precautions.**" Jakira's food sits forgotten beside her as she brings her knees up to her chest and wraps her arms around them. Her stance allowing her to hide the fact she's shaking. Beneath her feet she can feel the pulsing of the power beneath her, coming from the depths of the temple. *What is going on? Something happen to Jareth?* It took her only a moment to realize that was probably not the case. It felt different from the last and first time Jareth had reached out to her. She knew her empathy was stronger than most of her kind, but this wasn't emotions she was feeling.
Next to her, she notices Wes is looking at her strangely. Having been so self absorbed in what was happening to her she hadn't even noticed he had laid down. Confusion was written over his features. "Not sure what you used in your medicine Jakira but has it been known to cause hallucinogenic sensations?" Wes asks her.
With a shake of her head she dismisses the idea of the hallucinogenic medicine; she doesn't trust her voice to reply. *Had he felt it too then?* Looking out over the other Hobben she wonders who else had felt it. Still enjoying the impromptu party, none of the other Hobben on the lawn seemed to be affected by whatever it was.
As the pulsing continues to grow only stronger, she pulls herself to her feet, her curiosity overcoming her initial fear and confusion. Her food completly forgotten now, she leaves it behind on the grass. With a forced smile to Wes, an attempt to make him think all is well. "**Come on, let's find the others.**" Offering her hand to help him up its not long till she's leading him into the bowels of the temple. Her steps as sure as she leads him toward the hidden passage which would take them to the archive.

He takes a deep breath as an uneasy feeling explodes through his entire body. The hair stands on the back of his neck as he shields his eyes as the bright shafts of light form into the silhouette of an ancient-looking man. Jareth then slides a hand to his blaster as the hologram speaks. "**Gar ner Mando'ade… A'gar ner Jetiise ner. Val'gar dar'manda**?"
The Voice looks at Jareth for a translation, but he shrugs in response. In his best common, the young man steps forward.
"**We on Solsis VII planet. Big jungle. Him Hobben. Him Ithorian. Me Human. Temple for pray-pray-heal. You from where-where?**" The young man makes the appropriate big gestures for each word stated, and gives Oraltor a confused look before staring at the holograph for a response.

At his question about her medicine she simply shook her head. He watched her as he sat back up. Her expression had changed as had her body language which was indicated by her legs as they were drawn up to her chest. He reached out and grabbed his carbine. Something wasn't right. Problem was he wasn't sure what was going on.
He still felt the draw of the power he felt from beneath him. Strange yet inviting he began to wonder if this had anything to do with the Jetiise. His mood began to sour again
Next to him he saw Jakira stand. It almost seemed forced in it's efforts. The plate of food that she was so interested in only minutes ago is all but now forgotten. Looking up at her he not only noticed her beautiful face but the strained smile that she wore. "Come on, let's find the others." He took her offered hand. Quickly she began to lead him away with a sense of urgency.
His voice was even as he spoke. It wasn't hard to notice some of the hardness had returned to it. **"You feel it too didn't you? The power from beneath us. It's where you're taking us."** It wasn't a question really as he still felt the ebb of power beneath him and the same sense of emotion from Jakira as before. The hand on his carbine tightened as a thought came to mind. **"I have a feeling this has something to do with that Ithorian Jetii and the one that put me in that karking coffin all those years ago."** He followed her to the hidden passage that he never would have known was there. **"Jetiise and their prophecy."** He almost swore again but stopped. ***I could be in worse places and with worse company.*** He thought as he watched the lithe form of Jakira lead him.

Jakira stops short of heading down the stairs, realizing that though she had come here looking for Oraltor, notorious for his strange experiments, and the Voice, whose wisdom she had come to greatly respect, the pulse of power she had felt earlier emanated from the archive itself. "**I… didn't intend to… Oraltor has a lot of explaining to do.**" She didn't doubt now that he had something to do with what she was feeling from the room below. It was probably a good thing the Voice and the Elders were there to manage what ever nuisance Oraltor was making of himself.
The joviality has left her features, now she just seems, well, afraid. A fact she attempts to hide by not letting Wes see her face. Her emoutions always close the surface she didn't want Wes to see it. Balancing herself using the wall she turns to make her way down the stairs. "**Oraltor made the rooms down here his laboratory. It's become an archive sorts and the Hobben council and their families have taken refuge down here.**" she explains in an attempt to take her mind off of the ever increasing pulse she feels from the room beyond.
The dimmed glow rod lamps return to life as the draw near, passing them as they spiral down. It had been awhile since she had ventured here, coming only when the Voice needed to speak to her. She never liked in these subterranean rooms her Ithorian friend enjoyed. With a glance behind her she asks a simple question to Wes, "**What is jettise?**"

Al'verde slowed down as he heard his comm chirp to life **"My kind of sport?

Slowly his HUD blinked to life and ran through it's systems check. After running through everything he smiled *Time to have some fun perhaps I could scare them by showing off my cannon before shooting them.* thought as he rode his need bike back to the ship grinning.

She stopped short at his question just short of the stairs they were about to descend. ***Closer to the mark that I thought.*** He thought to himself.
"I... didn't intend to... Oraltor has a lot of explaining to do." She said out loud still looking away from him. He felt something shift in his perception of her. What he didn't know.
Wes snorted. **"I've been wanting a good explanation from him since I woke up but have yet to receive one. It seems to be a common occurrence with him."** She didn't turn as she spoke. She simply looked in the direction that they were going. She began moving again this time down the stairs. "Oraltor made the rooms down here his laboratory. It's become an archive sorts and the Hobben council and their families have taken refuge down here."
Wes nodded even though she could not see it. ***Makes sense keep the valuables down deep where they would be safer than on the surface.*** The fact that she mentioned the Hobben council was also down here didn't get past him.
He followed The Zeltron as she lead him down the passageway. Glow rods lit and extinguished as they approached and descended moving farther away from them. He began to wonder what was gong on. Was it the Force that he was sensing. Nestil had said that he was Force Sensitive. He didn't believe it then but now he was beginning to question it.
He looked up from the stairs when he noticed that Jakira had looked back at him. Now he knew why she hadn't been looking at him before. He saw the emotions as they kind of went along with what he was feeling. He figured it wasn't something that she generally felt. "What is Jettise?" She asked.
He came to a stop looked her in the eyes. **"Jetiise. It's the Mando translation for Jedi. Jetii being the singular form. A century ago an old Jetii put me in that hibernation chamber saying that the future would be when I would be needed most. That I would then live up to my potential."** He wasn't sure why he was telling her this but he figured that if she also felt what was below them then maybe she can help him understand what was going on.
**"I don't understand what is gong on down there. I fought along many a Jetii during the Vong War but never did one of them ever tell me I had the potential to be like one of them. I guess that's why I'm having a hard time understanding it now."** His expression was honest. The Jedi he could understand. Himself having the potential to be like them was a different story altogether.

**"Sumthin' like that,"** the pirate replied to Al before disembarking the *No Chance*. Locking the ship down, he waited for Al to arrive on his bike, making himself busy by cuing up his comlink again, this time in an attempt to get in touch with Rehn. **"'Ey, Pinkie,"** Kurr joked. **"What be yer location …an' that o' yer Mate, the hammerhead, eh? There's a question I gots fer him."**
Once Al arrived, the feeorin greeted him with a crooked smile and made sure his comm wasn't on 'broadcast'. **"Ah, there ye be, Mate. Ya likin' that bike thar, eh?

Jakira stops as Wes does, turning slightly to face him fully, her hand still resting on the wall lest she fall down the spiraling stairs. Giving her first genuine smile she can't help but giving a small laugh, "Oraltor can be slow on explantations, He's on his own timetable."
Growing serious again she takes his hand with her free hand she felt more than saw the same emotions coursing through him. Not only had they shared the sensation, but also the resulting confusion and fear. "**I'm sorry… I don't know what's happening. But I'm fairly certain the Voice or Oraltor will know.**" Under her breath as she turns to start back down she adds with an audible sigh, "**If not the cause…**"

Weanwarched as Jakira smiled and gave forth a little laugh. Her explanation of the Ithorian seem to be right on.
**"Well let's hope his time table picks up some. I'd like to be still living when he gets around to telling us what's going on."**
He saw a seriousness fall back over her features. Taking his hand she turned and continued on down the stairs. As she led she apologized for not knowing what was happening. He sighed. While he wanted to still be angry with the situation her touch had seemed to diffuse some of it again.
**"Well one thing is for sure I intend to find out what is going on. One way or another."** . He said as they descended the spirialing stairs.
Ancew steps farther he had another question. **"How many other Jetii are there here in this compound? Are any of these elders Jetii or some other tradition that uses be Force?"** He asked trying to find out as much as possible.

Al'verde landed the speeder and got off looking impressed with it **"So what do you think?"** he asks before walking over closer **"Oh a collection job. It's been a long time. I may have to brush up on my…*negotiation* skills."** he added holding his left arm. Suddenly the armor opens up as a power hammer revels itself attached to his left arm **"I'm sure this could help change his mind." **The hammer slowly retracts as Al'verde lowers his arm **"So where are we headed, or do I get to go by myself?"**

**"Whothekriffwhat? Oh, it's you. Yeah, we're at this hospital… Temple… House… Library-thing. Look, I'll turn on my comm tracer and you can just follow it."**
The comm channel cuts out abruptly as the Zeltron closes communication with the pirate. It's easy for Kurr to hail a speeder cab and he and Al'verde are soon zipping around jungle paths at break-neck speeds, the taxi driver taking them along a path least likely to end with them being eaten by something large and filled with acid.
As the Feeorin is enroute to the hospital, his commlink blips several times before the voice of a fairly disgruntled sentient answers his previous communique.
**"Whowhatthekriff? Somebody uses this channel? What's the nature of your complaint spacer?"**
It is easy for Kurr to tell that the man isn't overly sincere about that last question, and it has likely been quite some time since he has taken his job on this backwater very seriously.
*******************************************************************************
**"…Perhaps you are a Jedi then, for only they have enough compassion to care for the so-obviously mental deficient."**
The holograph nods to Jareth while continuing to address the Voice, and although its voice is monotonous all gathered can sense a hint of wry-amusement coming from the projection. It speaks in perfect basic now, forgoing the language it had used earlier.
Oraltor has recovered enough of himself to straggle forward and clear all four of his throats in an attempt to gain the Mandalorian's attention. When the projection turns to regard the Ithorian, Oraltor bows respectfully before speaking.
**"Greeting's Holocron Gatekeeper, I am Oraltor Sorendee, Historian of the…"** The Ithorian flounders a moment before he forges ahead, **"Of the Jedi Order, although it is currently in a state of… *flux*, as we'll call it. May I ask who safeguards this holocron's secrets?"**
The greeting seems perfunctory and well rehearsed enough, and the projection nods slightly, acknowledging the Jedi.
**"I am Arvendus Del-Fin, he who would later be known as Warmaster of the Mando'ade Knights, and then Mand'alor the Arbiter. You do not appear as any Jedi *I* have ever encountered, what is the year?"
"Ehrmm… Let's see, judging by the design of your armor I'd place you as having lived during the New Sith Wars. If that is so, then it has been some 3,000 years since your time, Warmaster."**
Arvendus shakes his head in silence, the lightsaber in his hand extinguishing as he clips it to his side, the blade in his other hand sliding into a scabbard at his waist.
**"Then much time has been lost. And what of the Mando'ade of this age?"
"They yet thrive Warmaster, although not much has been heard of them since their new Mandalore has come to power- ah, here is someone you may be very interested in meeting."**
Oraltor gestures a hand towards Wes as he and Jakira appear from around a bend and enter into the archive. The Mandalorian hovering above the casket turns to peer at Wes, and those gathered around the oubliette can feel a warmer sensation coming from the hologram, one of welcome and invitation.
**"*Su cuy'gar ad'ike aliit tal'din.* Greeting's son of my blood. You look like you've been dragged through hell, and freshly wrung out."**
*******************************************************************************
The stairs leading down into the archive are steep, but blessedly dry and negotiable, and so the Zeltron and the Mandalorian make it to the bottom with little fanfaire, although a slight stitch has begun to form in Wes's side.
As the pair come around a recessed corner, they see nearly two dozen Hobben gathered around a holographic image along with Oraltor, Jareth, Nestil, and Rehn. All eyes turn to Wes and Jakira as the holograph, a tall Mandalorian dressed in archaic armor, addresses Wes, and directly afterwards there's an empty silence as they all await Wes's response.
A beeping sound interrupts the awkward pause, and Rehn shakes himself free of the weird scene to respond in a put-upon whisper before he brusquely ends the communique and turns back to the others with a sheepish grin.
*******************************************************************************
After a harrowing ride through the Solsian jungle, Kurr and Al'verde arrive just outside of the temple. The temple is a tall ziggurat crafted out of massive stone blocks, a relatively-modern villa crowning it's plateaued top. Out front a pair of Hobben guards stand watch, warily eyeing the Feeorin and the giant Mandalorian as they approach.
Cookfire smoke can be seen wafting from the top of the ziggurat, and the smells of all manner of savory foodstuffs floats down from the manor to tickle Kurr and Al'verde's noses.

Sitting in the cab, the feeorin paid attention to the twists and turns the vehicle took. Part of him knew that he'd need to have a good escape route just in case. **"Oi!,"** Kurr barked into the commlink, **"Ain't you people got sumthin' better t' do than sleep on yer comms? I gotta boat that needs sum workin' on if yer interested. Bay 19 … jus' need sum kinda quote frum ya befer ya start, eh? Jus' treat 'er with sum luvin', Mate."**
As the speeder comes to a stop outside the temple, Kurr steps out, paying the cabby to 'hang out' for a few. Looking around, he mumbles, **"Yup, gotta keep th' motor runnin'."** Walking up to the guard, the feeorin smiled lopsidedly, his eye whirring and clicking as it focused on the him. **"Evenin' Guv … I be lookin' fer a tiny, pink man named 'Rehn' and his hammerheaded friend. Mebee ya ken point me in th' right direction, eh? He's part o' me crew, an' we wuz told t' meet him here."**

Wes continued down the stairs following Jakira her hand still holding his. Taking what small comfort it granted he gave it a squeeze as she guided him father down. **"At least with the stairs dry we won't fall and break our necks."** He gave a seldom heard chuckle.
After what seemed many steps he began to develop a pain in his side. Despite the medical treatment and food from Jakira he was still was tired and not up to full strength. As a result he found himself relying on her a bit more for support. **"I'm sorry I didn't realize we were going down so far. I guess I really do need some rest."** He said kind of sheepishly as they left the stairway and entered the room.
Upon entering he looked around. He saw the others that he arrived with on the *No Chance* and the one named Jareth. In the center stood a holographic image of a Mandalorian. Looking closer he noticed red, black and grey colors adorned the armor. Colors that were the same as his. He also noticed the lightsaber that hung from his armor along with another sword at his waist.
Before he could blink twice the hologram spoke. "Su cuy'gar ad'ike aliit tal'din. Greeting's son of my blood. You look like you've been dragged through hell, and freshly wrung out." This was what they felt only moments ago. The hologram was the power that had been a beacon to them drawing them both like moths to a flame.
If the young Mando's eyes could have gotten any wider they would have as he stood there next to Jakira still holding her hand for support from the long trek down the stairway.
**"Su cuy'gar Mand'alor."** Wes managed to get out despite being surprised. Not only were the clan markings the same her wore the mask of the Mandalore. He stood a little taller despite the pain in his side and shoulder. **"Yes I've been through a lot in the last twelve hours but the *Mir'osik* learned something valuable. *Ke nu jurkad ti Mando'ade, burc'ya!*"** He said with a chuckle that sent a pain to his already sore side. **"I am called Wes Del-Fin."** He spoke his clan name with pride to the hologram not knowing exactly what it was.

As the old bike slowly set down Al'verde powered in down and glanced over at Kurr. His HUD lit up and showed two targets. He let out a small sigh as he punched a few things into his bracer computer. Now his HUD read only one target and one friendly. Al'verde was looking forward to this, it had been a long time since he got to do things his way. Seems like everyone wanted to tell him how to do things or just wanted to use him lately and he was tired of it.
As he slowly got off the bike he moved his cape so that is covered his right arm. As he approached the tip of his heavy assault rifle could be seen on his back, indicating that is was slung behind. He walked up behind Kurr and frowned when he heard him asking to pointed in the right direction *So much for doing things my way. I would told this guard he was going take me to him or his lower regions would be turned to pudding*. He looked at the guard and smiled **"Shaadlar ra ni kadala gar."** he said in a friendly tone as he crossed his arms.

Jakira leads Wes down the stairs, moving as quickly as she dares, but slows when she sees how much trouble Wes is having. *What was I thinking bringing him down here like this.* She looks behind her and gives him a smile as he chuckles over their good fortune on the stairs being dry. At least, she figured, he was able to find something to be happy about. *He's likely not going to be able to get back up until he's had a good rest. At least he'll be in good company down here.* She thought wryly.
Finally they made the landing which would take them into the archive proper. The tingling on her skin was stronger now, almost uncomfortable in its intensity. She fought hard to ignore the urge to scratch at her skin as she knew full well there was nothing there. Her hand was small in his as she squeezed it and than gave him a self assuring smile. They both knew whatever power they had been feeling was coming from the room beyond. She started to move toward the doorway into the room with Wes, walking side-by-side, hand in hand toward some unknown they would now have to face. From within she could hear Oraltor talking to someone in a rather formal tone.
The first thing she sees is the hovering hologram, in position over the casket where Wes had been in stasis. Frozen in place she moves only has Wes, their hands still intertwined, takes steps forward urging her forward toward the hologram. In her pocket, she hears the faint clicking of her commlink. In her shock she almost misses it, but using the distraction to clear her mind of the fear and give it some purpose, she carefully withdraws her hand from Wes's grasp and pulls it out. It had been the signal that strangers were approaching, but thankfully not the Imperial Sith. While it probably wouldn't require her immediate attention, as they did infrequently get some of the spacers from the capital and the spaceport which lays between, if anyone was injured her assistance may be needed.
Taking steps away from the hologram toward the door she had come through, she finally notices the others in the room. She gives a respectful nod to the Voice and the Elders closest to him and then she's around the corner. Leaning against the wall, she inhales and releases a heavy breath. The Zeltron doctor can't help but to feel a sense of relief from leaving the room. Though there's a part of her which longs to return to discover the mysteries that Oraltor has discovered.
Activating her comm she attempts to find out the purpose of the new arrivals and whether or not the Hobben will be requiring her assistance in dealing with them. "**Jakria here, have the strangers identified themselves?**" she asks in a near whisper in the Hobben tongue so as not to interrupt the conversation withing the archive.
The response is a gruff Hobben voice, one obviously filled with tension as he speaks in his native Hobben tongue. "**Two more visitors. A leering giant wearing more armor than a SunBug, and the other with red eyes and talking like he has a mouth full of hot mush.**" After a short pause he then asks, "**Want us to chase them away?**"
Not liking the sound of anyone coming to her hospital in a full suite of armor she asks slowly, "**They say what they want?**"
"**Mush mouth says he wants a tiny pink man when he hits his friend in the head with a hammer, he talks too fast. The other one speaks even more gibberish, but I can understand a shiny threat when I hear one.**"
Jakira pauses in confusion, not sure what to make of what the Hobben guard is telling her. "**They aren't Imperial?**" she asks them through the comm, even though they would have indicated just as much in the initial warning.
The Hobben guard squints at the pair in front of him, frowning in deep concentration. He then shakes his head as he responds, "**No, they aren't like any Sihth'ebradai I have seen. Just the normal kind of ugly and confusing.**"
"**Well… then you can let them in, but keep them under guard till I can get up there.**"
The guard clicks his comm-link in affirmation, before waving for Al'verde and Kurr to follow him. "**Ee… Kay…. You come. Make no attack, I show head hammer and tiny pink man,**" He says in a broken basic. Being familiar with all manner of deliriums the jungle's environs can cause, the Hobben guard leads the two in as if he were admitting in-patients.
With the comms now off and the crises averted for the moment, Jakira turns back to face the doorway into the archive. The exchange had brought back her self confidence and now what was in the archive didn't seem to frighten her as much now. With a new confidence she steps back into the archive.

**"Great, boyo, ya lead th' way, eh?"** Kurr smirked and said to Al, **"See, Mate … alls ya gotta du is know how t' talk t' people. Still, keep yer eyes abut ya, eh? Never know whatcha see here."** As they walked along, the feeorin payed close attention to his surroundings, making mental notes of the exits, the weapons that people used and anything that seemed remotely explosive. Deep down Kurr hoped it didn't come down to it ... but he could use a cut of those creds, especially since it was their 'daring' escape that damaged his ship ...

**"You gotta *who* in the *where*? Grrhh… For kriffsakes…"**
There's the sound of shuffling and faint cursing as the port master sounds like he is search for sometihng. After more muffled rustling, the dock authority returns and there's the sound of blowing as if he were clearing a great deal of dust from an object and then the sound of key presses as he thumbs through a datapad.
**"Eh… Looking at yer bucket from the security cams, you've got a fair amount of blast damage but no hull breaches. I'd estimate that'd be a 1200 cred job. Anything internal will run you 200 creds an hour for labor, plus whatever it takes for parts… This all before the Emperor's taxes are applied, of course."**
Years of piratical living have left Kurr with an acute sense of when the firaxan sharks are circling, and the dockmaster's tone sounds like he smells blood in the water.
*******************************************************************************
The Hobben guard leads Al'verde and Kurr through beautifully-cultivated landscapes and through the hospital's stone and plasteel entrance. An attractive Hobben administrative assistant sits behind the desk of the waiting room, while scattered around are a number of Hobben in varied states of duress: swooning disease, broken bones, swelling of all kinds, afflictions one would find commonplace in a tropical wilderness.
**"You wait, Doctor come. You wait first."**
Gesturing to a pair of available seats away from a majority of the Hobben, the guard then takes up a chair next to the front desk and in clear view of where he directs Kurr and Al'verde to sit. The attendant comes from behind the desk and slinks up to the pirate and the Mandalorian, offering a datapad to each.
**"Doctor Jakira will be the returning soon… Please fill information while you wait, better to be serving you…"**
Racing across the datapads in a barely decipherable scroll are countless legal agreements, liability waivers, galactic HIPAA qualifiers and enough legal jargon to make Kurr's cybernetic eyes cross. None of the other patients appear to be filling out any forms, and judging by the arrangement of basic and other trade languages these forms are specifically meant for the occasional Imperial and odd spacer "lucky" enough to find their way into the Hospital's inviting confines.
*******************************************************************************
**"It is good to see that the *Verd'runi* still runs deep in the clan."**
Arvendus steps forward over the casket, appearing to hover in air for a moment before the projectors auto adjust to place him firmly on the ground. As he moves, his size shifts to become something more approximate to where he would have stood in life, but he still cuts an impressive figure, easily of a height and build similar to Al'verde's. The Warmaster comes to stand before Wes, his hands resting on his belt as he sizes up the younger Mandalorian.
**"I sense a great many questions in you Wes, least of which is how I may sense anything in you at all. I am the last Warmaster of the Mando'ade Knights, and the final guardian of our traditions and lore."**
The Hobben and those others gathered around the casket shift to allow the former Mandalore room as the projection begins to stalk a slow circle around Wes.
**"You have within you the ability to embark upon our path- to master the conflict inherent in all life. But know that to master our way is to become the very eye of battle; falter from the path and you *will* find yourself crushed in the maelstrom. There will be no return."**
Arvendus comes to stand before Wes again, and the young Mandalorian can feel something more than the Warmaster's gaze falling upon him, something questioning, searching for some truth inside of the wayward warrior.
**"As is our way, if you accept my lessons I will make you earn every scrap of knowledge. You will be sundered, smelted, and forged anew. Accept, and you will face trials greater then any you have ever known, but earn a heritage not seen in this galaxy in over three millenia. Decline and face the galaxy as you will, and I will await a warrior that is truly worthy. The choice is yours."**
The room has a sepulcher's silence, and all eyes are upon Wes, although just behind and seen through the translucent holocron projection Oraltor is giving the young Mandalorian all manner of high sign and gesture as to his preference for Wes's choice.

Jakira reenters the room, shifting around the outside of the circle which has formed around Wes and the holographic Mandalorian as he moves around sizing up his descendant. Stopping to stand next to the Voice, she watches the exchange curious of what has exactly transpired while she was in the hallway. Prepared to question the Voice on what has happened she is hushed by the silence of the room as they all wait to hear Wes's response. Waiting to hear what he would choose.
"**Lessons**," she whispers directing her question to the Voice, finding her voice yet still not wanting to interrupt the silence. "**What lessons? Mahchen, what is going on?**"

Al'verde looked down at the papers and sighed. His first thought was to tape the datapad to the end of his cannon then open fire, but his figured that might cause too much of a scene. Then again it might liven things up a bit and god knows he was getting bored with this job. He looked over at Kurr and elbowed him had in the side **"Ni ganar nayc ca'nara par ibic. Ibic go'naasir be ca'nara!"** he said aggregated as he set the datapad down. His fingers were twitching as he glared at Kurr. Al'verde no longer cared if it was Kurr's fault, he was blaming him. He leaned in close and said something in a quiet, yet ferm, tone **"Mhi yaimpar ni kadala gar."**
As he continued to wait he leaned back and crossed his arms behind his head as he crossed his ankles **"Ibic bora sooranir."** Al'verde knew that on one in this room really knew what he was saying but he no longer cared about this. He would rather be back on the ship cleaning his armor and weapons that sitting in a waiting room. As he waited he began to plot his evil dead that he would do back on the ship.

Wes stood his ground against the hologram of the Mandalorian. There was something odd and yet strangely familiar about what appeared before him. He had never seen this one before but something told him to be mindful. It wasn't his instinct it was the Force yet he didn't realize it yet. The sensation he felt above ground with Jakira seemed all the more potent in the chamber.
He nodded when it was mentioned that the "Warriors soul" still ran deep in the clan. For it did otherwise he would have been dead in the war with the Vongese. The projection moves closer to stand before him. If it was accurate the figure was imposing though the size of an enemy meant nothing to a warrior. He watched at it finally stood in front of him. Hands resting on his belt. It seemed as if the eyes of the projected image was peering into his inner being.
"I sense a great many questions in you Wes, least of which is how I may sense anything in you at all. I am the last Warmaster of the Mando'ade Knights, and the final guardian of our traditions and lore." Before he could speak the Mandalore moved, circling him. Despite being just a projection Wes noticed that the others that had gathered here moved out of its way. ***Odd that a projection can have such a presence. I can feel it a plainly as I felt Jakira's hand in mine only moment ago. What is this?*** He thought as he watched the Mandalorian.
"You have within you the ability to embark upon our path- to master the conflict inherent in all life. But know that to master our way is to become the very eye of battle; falter from the path and you will find yourself crushed in the maelstrom. There will be no return." His eyes narrow at the mention of his 'ability'. It sounded a lot like the ramblings of the old Jetii and the Oraltor. ***Again there is more talk of my ability. And now I have some projection telling me the same thing.***
Coming full circle Arvendus comes to a stop in front of the young Mandalorian. Wes can feel the presence of the image boring into his essence. As it it was seeking something within him. ***What are you looking for? I have nothing to hide.*** As if in response to his internal question Arvendus again speaks.
"As is our way, if you accept my lessons I will make you earn every scrap of knowledge. You will be sundered, smelted, and forged anew. Accept, and you will face trials greater then any you have ever known, but earn a heritage not seen in this galaxy in over three millenia. Decline and face the galaxy as you will, and I will await a warrior that is truly worthy. The choice is yours."
There was no hiding his surprise as his eyebrows shot up. A silence fell across the room. One so profound they could have heard a nerf hair hit the floor. To his side he heard Jakira's voice though he didn't look her direction. His facial features come back under control. ***Questions you say. Yes. I now have many of them.*** He thought as he caught sight of Oraltor and interpreted the Ithorians in that the Jetii wanted him to say yes. ***It is my decision Jetii and mine alone. It is not one that will be made lightly.***
Surprisingly to the ones that were also gathered his voice was strong when he spoke.
**"Yes I have questions. I would be foolish not to."** He paused for a moment as Arvendus stood before him unwavering despite the dust in the air that made the image ripple as it settled.
**"You wear the mask of the Mand'alor and wear the colors of the Del-Fin clan upon your beskar'gam. Yet I do not recognize you from my teaching as an ad'ika. You speak of being the last Warmaster of the Mando'ade Knights. Again I was never taught this. And you greeted me as, ad'ike aliit tal'din. 'The son of my blood.' You carry a Jetii'kad, the weapon of a Jetii. I can feel the power resonating in this room and my only explanation is that it is coming from you. It's similar to when I fought alongside the Jetii in the Vongese War."**
He stopped for a moment before he asked his last question as he wasn't sure what the answer would be or if he was ready for it.
**"Meg cuyir gar?"**

Hearing the squawk of his comlink, Kurr listened in, gritting his teeth the whole time. **"Now wait a gristin' minute, ya cord-chompin' Mynock,"** he barked into the comm, **"200 creds per hour?

With the arrival of the ancient mandalorian and Zeltron, and ongoing conversation between the two ancient warriors, Jareth quietly makes his way to the back of the room. He scratches his head before a thought comes to his mind: *There is a plethora of interesting things I haven't seen ever in this basement* "**This is a good collection of stuff you have here.

The Voice of the Ali'la looks from Jareth and back to the holographic apparition, in awe at how nonchalant the scout was in the face of the incredible Force presence coming from the Holocron, and happenings that have developed in recent moments. Mahchen nods slightly to the human before he turns an astonished gaze on Jakira.
**"I… Do not know doctor. The Ali'la sings strongly of this *Man-dee-lore*,"** Mahchen expresses the syllables slowly to pronounce them well, **"although the song is as an echo of former greatness. Your young friend also sings, but his song is wild and untamed. It would seem the spirit is offering your friend a gift that carries with it a heavy cost."**
Behind the Voice, the Hobben Elders nod in sage acknowledgment of Mahchen's assessment. With the silence broken, the younger Hobben gathered behind the elders begin to chatter excitedly in their native tongue about the **"Warrior Spirit and his Gifts"**, much of the talk comparing Arvendus, and a lesser extent Wes, to heroes from Hobben folklore.
*******************************************************************************
**"You watch your bantha-kissing tongue talking about Emperor Krayt you filth, or I'll impound that heap quicker than your hutt-for-a-father slimed your nerf-for-a-mother!"**
It's easy to tell that the dockmaster is foaming at the mouth from his love of his Emperor, the number of lum ales he's ingested today, having been so rudely awaken from his nap, or any combination of the three. There's an awkward pause in the conversation as the man on the other end of Kurr's comm clears his throat and continues to address the pirate in a faux-neutral tone.
**"200 creds is by bureau standards for the lot we employ around here, and might I add it's a damn good price. Certainly the only one you're going to get with that attitude. 1200 creds for the hull work, 200 creds an hour for whatever we gotta do inside, plus parts and taxes. Take it or leave it *mate*, no skin off my reek either way, that's for kriffin' sure."**
*******************************************************************************
**"An excellent question ad'ika. To know who I am is to know the history of our order, and to know some of that which has been lost."**
Arvendus holds a hand out to his side and one of the projectors in the oubliette adjusts to display a scene hovering just above it. Hundreds of starfighters and capital ships of archaic manufacture engage one another in furious battle above some unknown world. The scene shifts to show Mandalorian warriors charging into war with an ever-changing array of enemies; primitive cultures riding massive creatures, more contemporary armies wielding blaster and vibroblade, and lastly an army of lightsaber-wielders led by a proud, fiery-headed man.
**"For centuries the Mandalorian people prowled this galaxy, searching for glory and conquest, never meeting their equal in combat. It was not until Mandalore the Indomitable's defeat at the hands of Ulic Qel-Droma that our expansion slowed, and in the subsequent alliance that was formed the Mandalorian people made their first true encounter with those that would master the power known as the Force."**
The scene unfolds to show the same fiery-headed man squaring off against four Mandalorians wielding vibroblades, although this time the Mandalorians have doffed their helmets. The man defeats each one, but rather than dispatching the armored warriors, he helps them to their feet and assumes an instructive posture.
**"The Taung race that would become the ancestors of the Mandalorian people never had much attunement to the Force, while those amongst our people that had some measure of aptitude were wilders, and made use of the power through instinct alone. Ulic Qel-Droma gathered from amongst our ranks any that showed a sensitivity to the Force, and began to train them in secret as a weapon to use against his master, Exar Kun."**
Targets whiz about the projection, to be shot down by blaster bolts from Mandalorian's, some utilizing the Force to levitate the targets and others using it to guide their aim while blind. All the while, Ulic Qel-Droma resides over the training with a watchful eye. Over time, an armored woman with long-flowing auburn hair comes to stand where Ulic Qel-Droma once stood.
**"Slowly their numbers grew, bolstered with each force-sensitive sentient adopted into our families until at last they numbered nearly a full clan themselves. They had a notion to form their own sect, to pass down their teachings and preserve their knowledge, and so they named themselves the Del-Fin after Xereen Del-Fin, who was the greatest amongst them."**
Xereen is riding a massive basilisk war droid into battle as the window changes, a battalion of warriors behind her. Some carry lightsabers, others blasters and vibroblades, but they are all in so cohesive and well-disciplined a unit as to be a many-faceted extension of one whole.
**"The Del-Fin clan spearheaded every charge into the most impossible of battles, and through their prowess and skill with the Force, managed to emerge victorious each time. The legends grew from their exploits, and their foes learned to fear and awe the red, black, and grey of their armor wherever they appeared."**
The scene then shifts to a broken war standard, the red, black, and grey banner shredded and the broken haft clutched in the death-grip of an auburn-haired woman.
**"But when Qel-Droma and the alliance was beaten, so began our fall from grace. The Mandalorians had grown to despise and mistrust those gifted with talent in the Force, and so our clan became ostracized. By the time of the- "**
Arvendus halts in his speech as several of the lights in the archive begin to flash from their soft yellow light to a bright red of warning. Jakira's comm-link begins to page frantically, and the indicator on the unit signals a disturbance in the Hospital's receiving room.
*******************************************************************************
The receptionist's smile is frozen as she tensely watches Al'verde become more agitated by the moment. When the giant, armored Mandalorian begins to rant in Mando'a, the Hobben woman surreptitiously triggers a panic button beneath the desk. The Hobben guard sitting next to her grips his old blaster rifle tightly as he eyes the giant. When Kurr swaggers over to the desk and makes his overtures to the pretty attendant, things become even more tense.
**"Please be the waiting and the sitting. The doctor will be here soon, and will help with the little pink man crabs and the head hammers…"**
A rivulet of sweat begins to trickle down the side of the receptionist's face, but her smile never fails and her eyes never leave Kurr and Al'verde.

Hearing his comm squawk again, Kurr turned from the desk and Al and answered it, hearing the dockmaster's rant. The grinding of the pirate's teeth was almost audible by any around him as his eye stopped whirring and locked in place. **"Oi! Ya've got nae reason t' b' impoundin' my ship, Bub! Kin I get yer badge number an' yer name?! I'd like t' speak t' the dock manager 'bout how 'is people kin't talk t' his clients, eh?"** He growled into the comlink, trying not to make too much of a scene. **"Fact, I'll be lookin' at headin' there in person an' speakin' t' him meself, Bub, eh?!"**
After hearing what he needed, he cut the conversation and turned back to the desk. **"Surry 'bout that. I dun't think yer understandin' … I'm lookin' fer sumone tha' came here .. name's Rehn, eh? Th' other's name is sumthin' like Erlater er sumthin' … came in with sum big dohickey an' a guy like this one."** The pirate made a motion to Al. **"D'ya get me?"**

"An excellent question ad'ika. To know who I am is to know the history of our order, and to know some of that which has been lost."
Wes listened to his ancestor tell the story behind the Del-Fin clan. a story that he had never heard of before. Their fearlessness in combat was always talked about and passed down in tales from generation to generation but never was it mentioned that it was founded by Force users. That fact simply surprised him.
For thousands of years Mandalorians as a culture had always been leery of the Jetii and Force users in general. He never would have thought that it might have something to do with his clan. ***Maybe that's why they buried that part of the history? Even this Xereen Del-Fin was never mentioned in my history studies. The effort to wipe that out must have been extensive.*** The young Mando thought as the projection talked. He wasn't sure if it was the Force or not but Wes could almost feel the emotions associated with the other projection of his current history lesson. ***Is this why I'm here? To fulfill my cland destiny and become a Mando'ade Knight? Makes sense now that I have this to go with what that old Jetii and the Oraltor have said.***
The image of the broken banned of the Def-Fin clan in the grip of a fallen auburn-haired woman caught his attention as the Warmaster spoke. "But when Qel-Droma and the alliance was beaten, so began our fall from grace. The Mandalorians had grown to despise and mistrust those gifted with talent in the Force, and so our clan became ostracized. By the time of the- "
The image stopped speaking when the lights began to flash bright red as if in warning. Wes looked to where Jakira stood. He heard he comm-link go off like something wasn't right. ***I have a feeling that the rest of the story is going to have to wait.*** He thought.
**"What is wrong Jakira?"** He said to the Zeltron doctor who was becoming a friend.

### **Alicia** (2010-08-04 17:07:53)

Jakira listens as Mahchen, the Voice, attempts to explain what was happening. She too felt the strength in the presence of the holographic Mandalorian. A fact which greatly disturbed her since a hologram shouldn’t have a presence at all, it should just be there. Seen and not felt one could say. Since the Hobben elder couldn’t explain what was happening she turns to listen to what the hologram was saying, catching the bits of forgotten Mandalorian lore.
That is until the lights flash from their usual comfortable glow to the warning indicator of scarlet. With some alarm, Jakira pulls the commlink from her pocket. "**A couple spacers arrived not too long ago. I think they've alarmed my staff.**" She tries to hide her alarm with a smile. Rarely was her staff ever put on such an alert. Being a proud and capable people they could more often than not handle the slew of spacers which came through the hospitals doors. The alarm was generally reserved for when the Imperials made an appearance or when some of the fuana decided they wanted to visit. "**Jareth, dear… I'm going to need your help.**"
Clicking open the channel she responds in the Hobben tongue "**I'll be there shortly.**" With another click she muted the channel but left it open to hear the guards chatter so she remained informed as she made her way up the spiralling stair case. "**I need to go,**" she says to all present. "**Sorry for the interruption,**" she adds, sheepishly as she makes her way quickly toward the stairs up. For once she was glad she had spent the time she had getting into shape, the stairs once might have left her exhausted.
As she passes Wes where he stands with his overbearing forefather, she decidedly ignores the hologram's existence. She gives Wes a small smile as she reaches where he stands. A part of her wonders if he's going to attempt to follow her up the stairs. He had, after all, offered his services for what they're worth in his current state. And not knowing what exactly the situation was, she might need all the help she could get. Not to mention he was good company. From the sounds of the chatter from her Hobben guards the crises in the waiting room wasn't immediate, but it was probably only a matter of time before that turned around. The two spacers were holing up in the waiting room, apparently talking nonsense as far as her staff within could discern.

## Re: Chapter 2: Way Down in the Jungle Deep

### **Yogi** (2010-08-04 23:19:50)

Wes heard Jakira give the explanation of what was happening as she pulled her comm-link. The flashing red lights still went about their business as the situation rolled on. He looked at her and the others that were around her trying to get a feel for how serious the situation was.
She turned and asked the one called Jareth for help. Wes stood there as she began to move apologizing for having to leave. He saw her come around the projection of Arvendus as she seemingly ignored the ancient image of the long dead Mandalorian. ***Something is going on up above.*** He thought as he saw the two of them in the same field of vision. He was torn at that moment. Here before him was an ancestor of clan Del-Fin. Holder of ancient knowledge and arts that could be of use to him. Next to the image Jakira walked hurriedly towards the chamber exit. He had promised to pay his debt to her. Her services that were already rendered and his that may or may not have to be called upon.
It wasn't till she gave him a small smile that he made up his mind. He took a quick step towards her and the exit. **"Jakira what's exactly happening up stairs? If you expect that trouble has arrived here at the hospital, I will go with you. I still owe you the debt for the medical attention you gave me."** He spoke with a determination that wasn't lost on any who heard him speak.
Standing tall he turned to the Warmaster. **"I owe this woman a debt of services as she has given me medical attention. In return for that I have offered my services as a defender of this place till the debt is paid."** He held out a hand to encompass the area. **"I will return as there is more to hear and questions to ask before I make my decision. Rest assured that it will be one that will not be taken lightly."**
He shifted his carbine and made to follow Jakira to the stairs. He wasn't looking forward to the long hike up them but he would do his best not to slow her down too much.

Jakira pauses at the door as Wes makes his speech to those in the room. *Brave words,*  she thinks. *He'll be half dead from exhaustion by the time he makes it up there.* Her lips purse in concern as the thought crosses her mind. Concern for his well being coming to the forefront, so much so, she is about to refuse his help. The decision, she quickly realizes, is out of her hands as he makes his way toward her. Turing to walk beside him, she sets a steady but slow pace, keeping an eye on how he's doing. Offering her arm with a small smile, she gives him whatever support he needs to get back up the stairs.
Before the long journey up the stairs she stops as they hit the first step, turning so she's on the step above him as he stands on the landing. Leaning forward she graces him with a slow teasing taste of a kiss. "**Thank you for coming with me…**" She starts, and then continues with a sly smile as she pulls away. "**Hopefully, this arduous journey will be worth it.**"

## Re: Chapter 2: Way Down in the Jungle Deep

### **Yogi** (2010-08-05 01:58:55)

When the Warmaster nodded in approval Wes turned and headed for Jakira who had stopped at the door. She was looking at him. He could see it in her eyes. She knew he wasn't at full strength an wondered if he'd be worth anything after the climb. ***"I'd be thinking the same thing Doc. But stopping a Mandalorian after he's made up his mind is more difficult that one may think.***
Coming up along side her she turned to walk beside him. He frowned a bit as the pace she set was slow but steady. **"I can manage a little faster. I'll be alright."** He saw her doubting look yet she keept an eye on him to make sure. The pain in his shoulder was pretty much gone. The medicine she used earlier had worked like she had said. The pain in his side from coming down the stairs had also subsided as he stood tall walking next to her. Yet he knew that going up was going to be a lot more taxing on his already weakened state.
He felt the offered arm she gave him. He didn't take it right away. It wasn't till they were out of sight beyond the door that he took her arm. Not so much for support but to just simply take it. She wanted to help and who was he to decline it. **"Thanks."** He said softly to her. There was sincerity in his voice with the thanks for the help. He was proud and maybe a bit stubborn to take help most of the time. But even he knew that a century's worth of hibernation didn't leave you well rested. Holding her arm lightly he crosses the few steps to the stairs.
As he went to take the first of what would be many steps up Jakira stopped, took a step up and turned to face him. She now stood just a little taller than him now as she looked him in the eyes. **"What are you…"** He started to say but stopped as she leaned in and gifted him with a tease of a kiss. As she pulled away, the taste of her lips were still upon his . "Thank you for coming with me..." She said with that same sly smile he saw only a bit ago in the exam room when they bantered back and forth. "Hopefully, this arduous journey will be worth it."
A quick half smile appeared on his face as he right side of his mouth turned up as he looked her in the eyes. **"I'll let you know later."** He teased back with that same grin on his face. ***First I have to make it up the stairs.*** He stepped to her side as she turned around. He seemed to have a bit more energy in his step as they began the hike up the stairs. He made good steady progress along side her. Racing they weren't but they were going faster than expected. Before they reached the half way mark he began to show signs of slowing as his breath came quicker. Looking up the spiraling staircase the warrior had a good sheen of sweat adorning his face. The stitch of pain from the effort given was coming back again as he placed a hand against his side.
It made him think of the time when he was a boy and he was made to run for a distance. How the pain would knot up in his side and it always seemed to help to place a hand there. He stretched his side causing him to lean towards her in an attempt to lessen the pain a bit. In doing so he felt her arm offered to him. With a nod he accepted it. **"This really isn't like me. Normally I'd be able to do this easily even in my beskar'gam"** He said with a quick breath as he took another step.

Jakira smiles encouragingly as they reach the mid way point and Wes pauses a moment to stretch the stitch out of his side. With obvious appreciation of his form she unabashedly watches. "**A couple years ago you could forget about it for me. I was a city girl through and through.**" Helping to support him as they steadily went up the stairs she continued to explain, hoping her talking would help to distract him from his discomfort. "**I grew up on Coruscant, my parents owned a cybernetics clinic. They were quite thrilled when I showed an interest in medicine and used it as a deterrent to keep me out of trouble,**" she says the last with a wry grin at him, obviously they didn't succeed completely. Pushing him forward she doesn't ease the pace at all.
"**I graduated top of my glass, an achievement in and of itself considering the racism growing under Darth Krayt's reign. I took a position at one of Coruscant's top hospitals. A few years later I followed my parents back to Zeltros and took over their clinic there**." She wrinkled her nose slightly. "**You should have seen some of the patients I admitted… some of them were worse than the pudgy governor Radge Rothke. And none of them wanting to take a young female Zeltron seriously.**" With a shrug she moves on to the next portion of her story.
"**Wasn't long that I decided to uproot myself again which is when I got the offer from the Hobben. They had to essentially bribe me to come here at first.. but I don't regret a moment of it.**" With the last of her words they finally reached the top, the wall hiding the stair case visible in the dim stairwell lighting. Jakira was slightly out of breath at this point, talking all the way from the middle of the trek up. Even she now had a twinge in her side. Moving toward the hidden door, she pulls a small lever beside the door and the wall opens revealing the hospital proper.
Turning to look at Wes she says with a grin, "**At least from here we can take the lifts.**"

Al'verde glared at Kurr *mumblin?!?! You bring me on a job where I am clearly not needed, force me to sit and wait, and now you dishonor my native tongue.* At this point Al'verde was ready to shoot someone he was just trying to pick who would be first. As he glanced at the guard a wicked smile, that would make other Mandalorian question the length of their life, came across his face. The guard might not be much of a fight but it would be fun to screw with his mind a bit. He sat up and leaned forward just slightly so the guard knew that Al'verde was talking to him **"Gar copaanir akaanir? Kebbur ni."** he said slowly as he tightened up his fist.
He no longer cared why he was here or what he was supposed to be doing. All he wanted now was a fight and everyone else, besides the guard, looked like nothing more than a waste of his time. He finely, and slowly, stood up. As he stood all his muscles tensed up the whole time not breaking his eye contact with the guard. He knew his helmet hid his face, but he also knew that helped add to his inhuman appearance. Part of him wished that he had his old armor paint job, with the skull on his helmet, but the gunmetal look also had its perks. Some said it made him look like a droid while others said it made him look like a ghost or something not of this world. Part of his wanted to know what the guard was thinking as he stood up and simply looked at him.

### **Yogi** (2010-08-05 13:34:34)

He listened to Jakira as she spoke. He used her voice as a focus point. Concentrating on keeping one foot climbing after the other in an effort to not slow to much. As it was he didn't have much say in the matter as she would sometimes put a hand at the small of his back and push gently as a reminder to keep the pace. Due to his concentration he failed to notice that she had been watching him with some appreciation.
When she mentioned that she was a city girl he nodded. It fit her to a tee. Maybe not so much now as he had already seen her here in her element but if he hadn't he would have guess she was a city girl. "...They were quite thrilled when I showed an interest in medicine and used it as a deterrent to keep me out of trouble," This time he looked at her and caught the grin she flashed.
**"I bet it did."** He said with a slightly pained grin as he stopped for a few seconds. It didn't last long as she again gently pushed him forward. She continued talking about school and training. They were so very different in how they grew up. She learned how to heal people while he learned how to wage war and kill the enemy. Well who ever the enemy was at that point in time. "...And none of them wanting to take a young female Zeltron seriously."
He nodded again slowing down but again putting one foot forward. ***Funny how things don't change. Views of Zeltrons were the same a hundred years ago. I would have also if I hadn't been made aware of this one here beside me. Just goes to show, Verd ori'shya beskar'gam. A warrior is more than their armor. Or in her case more then her looks.***
As they crested the last step Wes was now breathing pretty hard. He noticed that Jakira also slightly out of breath as she nursed a stitch in her side. He smiled. **"No regrets. It's the only way to look at things. To do so keeps you in the past and not the present. Buir used to try and teach me that."** When he saw the questioning look he realized he used the Mandoa word for Father. **"Buir is father in my language. Sorry It's easy to intertwine the two. It's something that I struggle to do even now here one hundred years in the future."**
She lead him to a wall to where he saw her pull a hidden lever that produced a door to the hospital. She turned to look at him a grin. "At least from here we can take the lifts." Smiling back he replied stepping into the lift. **"I shall have no regrets on taking it."**
As it began to move he let his body lean back against the wall and closed his eyes thankful that there were no more stairs. He sighed taking in a deep breath. **"Our childhoods were similar and yet vastly different. Like you I took interest in what my parents did though it was the complete opposite of medicine and healing."** He didn't have to go into details. While it was known that Mandalorians had trades they were all exceptionally trained warriors. Even the women. **"Our clan was well known by the time the Vongese came to cause their strife upon the galaxy. I was too young initially but I was able to take part in the last several years of the war. The New Republic hires us to fight with them alongside their troopers. Like the Warmaster said down there. Whenever the Del-Fin clan fought or defended a piece of rock we were always successful. Even in the last battle where I fought alongside my parents for the last time."** He paused quickly as his words settled and he remembered them.
**"Nu kyr'adyc, shi taab'echaaj'la. Not gone, merely marching far away.** He translated for her. **"Yes we won that day but our losses, my loss was great."**
He opened his eyes and looked at her. **"Now one hundred years later I find myself here. In good company I might add."** His grin faded as the lift dinged indication they had reached their destination. Wes shrugged his shoulders as he shifted his carbine. **"Now lets go see who is causing all the trouble."** His tone had shifted as there was now work to be done. He exited the lift, the stitch in his side was almost gone. Despite the small twinge he still stood tall as he walked down the short corridor to a set of double doors that would allow one of the hospital beds through with ease.
Pushing the one door open he stepped out carbine in hand. It was held in a non threatening way but Mandalorian was trained to make it ready in a split second if the poodoo should happen to hit the turbofan. Looking to the two he recognized the trouble makers as Al'verde and Kurr. His Mandalorian brother and the pilot of the *No chance.*
He smiled. **"Su cuy'gar Vod! I see you finally found your way here. I was beginning to wonder."** Wes let the carbine move to a resting position as he moved towards the two grinning. Not in his armor they may not have recognized him but his carbine and voice should both be easily noticeable. He breathed a small sigh of relief. He really wasn't in any condition for a fight. He looked behind and to the side where Jakira stood. **"These are two others that I came in with."**

Jareth blinked, as he inspected a particular artifact that used to be on display in the Jedi Academy on Ossus. As he touched the artifact, a flood of memories overtook him. Explosions, pain, grief, and fear. A thousand voices calling after him in a desperate plea for help, his only reassurance to them was a quick death and sweet oblivion as a prayer. Hopelessness as wide and as dark as the sea engulfs him, with no way out...
"**Jareth, dear… I'm going to need your help**." The Zeltron's voice beckons him away from his darkest thoughts like a fisherman's line. He nods as he quickly returns to reality. "**Right. Don't tell me one of the hobben got lost in the woods again. It took us a lifetime and a half to find the last one**" He then grabs for his sporting rifle with the ease of practiced soldier, and follows behind the trailing group. *So long as I got old faithful right here, i'ma be alright* He pats the weapon lovingly, as he finally catches up to Jakira and Wes before they reach the lifts.

Jakira smiles at Jareth as he joins them at the lift. Holding the door for him she waits till he's in before she punches the button for the level the waiting room is on. "**Decided to join us? We might as well make the trip up together.**" During the ride up she watches Wes as he tells his own life story, looking for any signs that his condition may further deteriorate.
His eyes close as he tells her the story and she can sense the grief which the time in hibernation had not softened. If anything, it had prevented him from mourning with his remaining family. Now not only had he his parents to mourn, but everyone else he had known for none of them would surely have survived into this era. Gently she rests a reassuring hand on his arm, it was the only support she could offer him. That and a small smile she's able to give him when his eyes finally open to look at her.
When he stands up straight, she quickly realizes he is getting into the mind set he uses when he's about to face a conflict. Pulling away slightly, she moves to stand closer to Jareth, the sudden transition from a kind man to hardened warrior almost alarming. All she can do is nod as he opens the doors ready to face the spacers threatening the peace of her hospital.
With a side long glance at Jareth she follows behind Wes, allowing him to take the lead. Along the way she pauses briefly to speak to the Hobben guards who had arrived outside the room, ready to come to the defense of those within. Motioning them to the side, the three of them pass by into the waiting area.
Standing behind Wes when they enter, she doesn't see who he's talking to at first, until she moves around for a closer look. Her eyes widen in surprise at seeing the huge Mandalorian again and then her attention turns to the Feeorin who she had not. "**Yes… I've met Al'verde already. But who are you?**" She adds the last to the Feeorin.
Once over the surprise there's a hard look of displeasure in her eye as her attention comes to her alarmed receptionist. Moving around the counter she sets a reassuring hand on the woman's shoulder and speaks to her reassuringly in her own tongue for a long while. The Hobben receptionist nods empathetically and in a twitter of more Hobben gathers the waiting patients and takes them deeper into the hospital away from the crazy spacers.
"**I'm Doctor Jakira, and this is my hospital that you've admirably put into disarray**," she says with some sarcasm, her displeasure still evident. Her naturally red skin now a dark crimson.

Kurr's eye clicked and whirred as he took in Wes, Jakira and Jareth. **"I b' Cap'n Kurr, ma'am,"** he said with a slight tilt of the head. **"An' I apol'gize fer any problems me er my mate here may have caused."** He made a motion towards Al, who he'd lost track of beyond a cursory manner. **"But, p'haps ya kin help me find sumone, eh? I'm lookin' fer a hammerhead 'bout yea-tall, along with a lil' pink guy that calls himself 'Rehn', eh? Looked as ef he'd b' a relatively o' yers … mebbe o' distant relations? Seems that I have sum business with th' two o' 'em an' was told they'd be here."** Again, he tried his best to pantomime the height and appearance of the beings he sought. **"They came in with th' gent there,"** he said, motioning to Wes, **"But he'd left m' ship in such a hurry, I hadn't had time t' inquiry 'bout a few things. So, if ya'd be kind an' point us in th' right direction, that'd b' mighty kind o' ya, eh?"**

Al'verde looked down at the guard and was about try something when he heard a voice. He turned and saw a man standing with a carbine hanging at his side. More importantly the man spoke Mando'a. Most of his anger slowly bleed out of him as he took a deep breath **"Vod'ika finely out of your second skin I see. So the doc get you all patched up?"** he asked walking over to the man "As for me I went out and got myself a little pet project, but when it's done." he paused as he watched the doctor walk in **"Well it might just be able to compete with the good doctor here in a beauty pageant."** he grinned.
As he listened to Jakira Al'verde stood up straight **"Hey now I didn't cause anything. Just because these people don't know my tongue and freak out cause I want to knock out Kurr here dose not mean that I caused anything. They jumped the gun on that one."** As he spoke he moved a bit closer to Jakira **"So is my brother good to go for the most part?"** Before she even answered he turned back to Wes **"So like I was saying I found this old Ikas-Adno 22-B Nightfalcon with the limited edition black powder coat finish and red-striping. It's got a few things wrong with it but nothing that's going to be too hard for me to fix."** he said wrapping his arm around Wes's shoulder **"Trust me when this thing is done it will turn almost as many heads as she turns."** he nodded to Jakira

Wes listened as Kurr spoke. He was looking for Rehn and the Ithorian. ***He must be wanting his payment for hauling them off the Wheel. CAnt say I blame him. His ship took some damage on the way out.***
He turned half way and looked at Jakira. Most of the demeanor that he had taken on just a few minutes ago had already fallen away. **"There was a deal made between the Ithorian, Rehn and Captain Kurr here on our way out of the wheel. I'm assuming that is what he is here for."**
He turned back just in time to see Al'verde walking over to him in greeting. **"Yes Patched up but I'm still not a hundred percent yet. That will take a little time. As far as competing with her in a beauty pageant I'd put my money on her as I haven't see your project yet"** He chuckled a bit which caused the stitch in his side to remind the warrior that he was still recovering. He placed his hand there to help the slight pain to subside.
He stepped back out of the way as Al began to talk to Jakira. He seemed to be all over the place in his thoughts and speach going back and forth from him to the doctor. Al was back to him quickly.
"So like I was saying I found this old Ikas-Adno 22-B Nightfalcon with the limited edition black powder coat finish and red-striping. It's got a few things wrong with it but nothing that's going to be too hard for me to fix." The big Mando said wrapping his arm around Wes's shoulder. "Trust me when this thing is done it will turn almost as many heads as she turns." He added with a nod to Jakira
He raised an eyebrow to Al as he looked up at him. **"An Ikas-Adno 22-B Nightfalcon. It's probably as old as I am. And at the moment probably runs better too.** He laughed again much to his displeasure at being reminded that he had just walked up a lot of stairs. **"Maybe when I'm rested I can help you work on it. Buir had one what I was a ad'ika. We used to work on it all the time."**

**"Mind yer manners, boyo,"** Kurr growled in Al's general direction, while still trying to maintain some pleasantries. **"This ain't th' place, er th' time, t' b' flappin' on 'bout yer dreams an' wishes."** It was pretty obvious that the feeorin didn't take Al'verde too seriously about the 'knock out Kurr' comment. Listening to Wes, the pirate grinned his lopsided grin and said, **"Ah, sumone who understands the finer rules o' space travel. That b' why we're here …er at least why I am,"** Kurr said, taking a slight jibe at Al. **"Now, if ya'd kindlee point in th' direction, I'd b' mightee grateful, eh?"**

### **Alicia** (2010-08-06 15:01:03)

Jakria continues her pout as Wes and Al'verde speak to each each other. She is still rather cross over the fact the two of them had disrupted the peace. "**Oraltor is currently busy and won't appreciate being interrupted. I'm sure what ever business you two have can wait.**" The finality in her tone leaves nothing to question as far as she's concerned.
Taking a deep, calming breath, her coloring returns to the normal hue of red and she forces herself to smile. She had been trying to ignore the fact that Wes and Al'verde had been talking about her as if she wasn't there and as if she was some mindless ornament. "**If you can behave yourselves, please enjoy the festivities on the grounds.**" With a glance at Al she asks slowly. "**It would be appreciated if you would tone down your… armament… If you would like a change of clothes something can be arranged.**" She hoped the hint wasn't too blunt to be offensive, but she'd rather he got the suggestion than have him start scaring her patients and staff again.
Pulling out her comm she speaks to Litasha on their private channel. "**We will be having two more guests tonight, please arrange something for them.**" Her hostly duties completed in her mind, she turns back to Wes. The exhaustion was starting to creep back on him, and she could see it in the set of his shoulders that he probably wasn't going to make it much longer. Moving to his side she gently starts to pull him away from Al and the others. "**If you'd excuse us, I'm going to see Wes gets the rest he needs to be his one hundred percent.**"

**"Err … hold up fer one minute, Jakeera?"** Kurr said in a confirming tone. **"I ain't one t' turn down a gud partee … but I'll still b' needin' t' talk to Erlatur 'bout his fee. Nice that he's busy an' all … but ain't we all, lass?

### **Yogi** (2010-08-06 17:06:56)

Wes turned his head when he heard Jakira speak. Despite having only known her for just a short time he had no trouble in recognizing that she was upset. The tone in her voice coupled with the even deeper color of her skin made it east to spot. It even looked like she was pouting. He closed his eyes as he remembered what he had said. It wasn't just from his comments with Al either. These two had disrupted the relatively peaceful hospital and from hearing her talk about it just moments ago he knew how much the places meant to her.
She seemed to get control of her self and emotions as she explained things and asked Al to basically set aside the armor for the time being. Wes winced a bit at that as he wasn't sure how it would go over with the big Mandalorian. Some of the brethren he had known before he ended up here had worn their armor all the time. They took it off for only a few reasons. One being the need to work on it. The other, a women. He looked back to Al and gave a shrug.
As she pulled out her comm-link he looked at Kurr wondering if the Captain would settle for what Jakira had laid down. To be honest he didn't really care at the moment. To say that the days events had been stressful and exhausting would have been an understatement. He didn't realize but his shoulders had begun to slump a bit. At her soft touch he looked to see her standing there. One hand on his arm arm the other on his shoulder as she began to lead him away from the gathering. "If you'd excuse us, I'm going to see Wes gets the rest he needs to be his one hundred percent."
He nodded not really wanting to fight. He wanted to go back and see the Warmaster but he figured that the projection can wait. It had waited for three millennia already what was another night.
They had gotten three steps when he heard Kurr's voice. He was about to apologize for his comments earlier about her but he didn't have the chance. Before they had taken three steps Kurr's voice sounded out behind them. Apparently Kurr was not of the same mind set of letting it wait till later. He stopped walking when Jakira did and waited for the good Doctor to continue her verbal wrangling with the Feeorin.

Jakira stops for a moment to look at the Feeorin who had yet to give his name. "I'm sorry Mr... " she starts but then continues not caring at the moment "that it's such an inconvenience for you. My suggestion is to take advantage of my hospitality, as lowly as it is, or find your way back to where you came from and hope that Oraltor will be free tomorrow when you return."
She turns and starts walking away arm in arm with Wes.

**"Oi! Listen here,"** Kurr barked. **"Nae t' trample on yar 'hospitality', Lady, but if ya're nae goin' t' help m' find yar friend, then I'll jus' start lookin' meself, eh? I've nae time fer yar games er yar rules …"** The pirate seemed done with being polite and started heading off into the building in a random direction, searching for Rehn, Oraltor and the credits he was planning on using to fix his ship. *Jus' got th' gristin' ship an' everyone an' their muther wants t' stop m' from fixin' it,* he thought to himself as he grumbled on about 'the inhospitably of hospitable hosts'.

Wes listened as Jakira responded. It solidified what he thought was there. That there was a rancor underneath the beautiful doctor disguise. Especially when it came to her hospital and the Hobben that work and live here. He noted that fact and filed it away for future reference.
She continued to walk again but they didn't get far for Kurr again spat off at the mouth. He turned as he saw Kur move to his right for a hallway that led from the area they occupied. His eyes narrowed as his grip on the carbine tightened. Jakira could hear the leather on its grip creak from the pressure. He looked back at her knowing full well that a Feeorin stomping around a hospital was bad for business. He searched her eyes trying to guess just how far she'd go concerning this.
**"You basically have three choices."** He lowered his voice as he spoke quickly. **"One you can let him tromp around your hospital disrupting anything and everyone he comes across. Two, you can shoot him dead for trespassing. Or three you can have him stunned into submission and then subdued by the security that you have already called in to help when you thought there was going to be trouble here."**
There was an slight click between them as Wes flicked the switch from the power setting from kill to stun. ***Its been a long time since I've had to even set the stun setting.*** He thought to himself as he shifted his eyes to the Kurr. **"He's is a good man though. He could have just left us all there on the Wheel to die."** The focus had come again. Back straightened most of the way as the shoulders came back as far as they were able to.

He scratched his head and frowned. *This might get uglier than a bantha's backside* The young man followed behind the Feeorin, his right hand not for from his rifle.
"**After all the alarms you raised getting here, I don't think there good doctor wants you parading about in her place of buisness. If you got some holes in your ship, I think those holes could wait a few more hours eh? In the meantime, why don't you grab a bite to eat? I think the Hobben are cooking up a feast tonight"**
Before entering the temple after Kurr, Jareth noticed the massive, armored-invader and releases a small exasperated sigh.
*Mphm. Three Mandos in only a few hours. If this keeps up, i'm going to end my days of exploring and become a nerfheader. A safe, non-mutilated, unshot nerfheader.*

## Re: Chapter 2: Way Down in the Jungle Deep

Jakira takes a deep breath and lets it out as a sigh of exasperation as the Feeorin captain prowls past them heading toward the hospital proper, and toward the series of guards she had told to wait. *I tried to be nice… now things have to get hard and probably messy.* Motioning toward Jareth so he can hear what she has to say, she starts in a low tone audible only to them.
"**Take the guards with you, see if a show of force won't change his mind. If he cooperates we'll take him up to the manor for the night.**" she glance toward the chrono. "**This close to night, not a cab driver on Solsis is going to want to drive through the jungle, unless it was a dire emergency.**" With a glance at Wes she continues, wondering if he was going to be up to what needed to be done. "**If he doesn't cooperate, use what force you need to to keep him from disrupting my hospital… We can put him up comfortably enough in one of the padded rooms for the night**."
Slowly she removed her support from his arm. "**I'm sorry it had to come to this, Wes. He may be a good man, but I doubt he's going to stop till he gets what he wants, and at this rate I'm not inclined to acquiesce**." To the both of them she says sternly, "**Above all he can't know where Oraltor is… right at this moment.**" All she could do was to hope they got the hint. The secret archive was the most important place in her hospital. It held the Hobben's past and part of their future, their leaders and knowledge. Who knew what extortion this Feeorin pirate would get from knowing about such a place.

## Re: Chapter 2: Way Down in the Jungle Deep

Looking back from Kurr He saw that Jakira was motioning to Jareth. "Take the guards with you, see if a show of force won't change his mind. If he cooperates we'll take him up to the manor for the night." Standing there he couldn't believe it was coming to this. Something must have gotten the Captain riled up. Granted he didn't know Kurr well at all. This didn't seem to be like him.
She looked back at him. He could see it in her eyes. She was wondering if he could do as he pledged earlier. "If he doesn't cooperate, use what force you need to to keep him from disrupting my hospital... We can put him up comfortably enough in one of the padded rooms for the night." He gave her a curt nod.
He felt her remove her arm from his and he heard her softly spoken words. He had to admit the more he heard the voice he liked it even more. "I'm sorry it had to come to this, Wes. He may be a good man, but I doubt he's going to stop till he gets what he wants, and at this rate I'm not inclined to acquiesce." It was then a sterner tone came into play. "Above all he can't know where Oraltor is... right at this moment." With another quick nod. **"Understood."**
He looked to his left as Jareth hadn't wasted any time and had taken off after the Feeorin with some of the security people.
Wes started to move off after the young man but looked back at Jakira. **"Coordinate with your security staff. Cut him off and trap him so we can close in, preventing him the chance to run freely."** He noticed the worried look on her face and gave her a quick smile. **"Everything will be alright."**
He looked at Al'verde as he passed. **"Vod, seeing the Oraltor right now isn't possible. Tomorrow."**
With out a further word he quickened his pace to catch up with Jareth and the guards. The pain and stiffness were forgotten for the moment as adrenaline was now providing him with what he needed for the possible conflict that may happen.
It was now time to trap the Feeorin. Question was would they be required to actually take him down or would he listen to a show of force.
OOC: Not sure when you're going to step in Zider. So I figured I'd leave it there.

Kurr stopped for a moment and slipped his comlink out from his pocket. Clicking it to life, the feeorin spoke into it. **"Oi! 'Pinkie', ya there?"** he said, adjusting the frequency to Rehn's com-signal. **"Ya wanna tell yar girlfriend t' ease up, eh? Where ya at, Mate? I'm in th' temple an' lookin' t' talk t' ya an' yer hammerheaded friend. Think ya kin come up here so's we kin 'discuss' things? Gotta a feelin' things might get … messy … if ya dun't, eh? I'm in th' lobby waitin' fer ya."** The pirate stayed where he was for the moment as he waited for his 'associates' to reply. While he tried to stay diplomatic to the best of his abilities, Kurr wasn't one to back down either ... and if it's a fight they wanted, he'd oblige them.

## Re: Chapter 2: Way Down in the Jungle Deep

### **Anazider** (2010-08-09 01:26:01)

With the tension threatening to bubble over, several Hobben guards stealthily advance into positions around the waiting room, and as Kurr stalks off they begin to trail him quietly, with Jareth in tow.
As the pirate ventures halfway down a hall and then stops to speak into his communicator, his shadow accompaniment halts and awaits his next move. The voice that responds to Kurr's communique is irritable and trending towards being high-pitched.
**"What the kriff do you want now, huh? Business with a Hammerwho? Waitaminute… That's right! Hey you taun-taun licker, where the kriff is my money!"** There's a slight amount of scuffling that can be heard, but to Kurr's trained ear it all sounds rather sissy-fied and ineffective.
**"I don't give two bantha poods about ancient armored idiots or your spikey-headed goons, gimme my money!"**
*******************************************************************************
Eventually, Oraltor, Rehn and Nestil emerge from deeper within the confines of the Hospital, curtailing the pirates advance. After a bit of explanation in three different languages, the guardsmen resume their posts and the tension all but leaks out of the room, the Hobben receptionist at the front counter becoming a great deal more genuine with her smile.
The Ithorian then goes on to details that after the destruction of the Jedi Temple, he carried on his masters work of collecting and archiving what Force-related Artifacts he could find. Often times this required a great deal of money, and so when a negotiation required a fair enough sum, Oraltor would go out to a reputable gambling establishment to test his luck. The old masters of the Temple always said he had a rather "unique" association with the force that would cause his luck to swing to extremes; one moment he would tumble into a spice negotiation between crime lords while tying his shoes, and the next he would hit the Idiot's Array in Sabacc seven straight times. Always when things would get too hot, he would make a lucky break for it and then bolt back to Jakira's temple to hide out, evaluate his latest findings, and plan for the next hunt.
And so Oraltor explains that he would have to gather the funds from several hidden sources, but it would take until the morning for the transactions to verify and complete without a tracer. After flashing the balances of a handful of his accounts to Rehn, Kurr, Al'verde and Wes, they find that sufficient proof that the Jedi will make good on his half-million credit debt.
With that finally settled, the dust-up from earlier is finally diffused and everyone moves on to enjoy the festivities at the manor atop the Hospital. When all manner of merriment is had and the night creeps towards dusk, each of the comrades retreats to their respective corners to continue their own party's in private, or to catch up on well deserved sleep, and the night passes in blissful repose.
...Or they would, if someone rather violently opposed to blissful repose didn't come a calling in the witching hours of the night.
*******************************************************************************
A presence disturbs Wes from his glowing slumber, rousing him while the pink-haired beauty dozing on his arm remains in contented slumber. The presence makes the hairs on the back of the Mandalorian's neck stand on end, and fill him with a deep foreboding, as if something, or someone, with sinister-intent approaches.
Checking the chronometer, it's barely an hour past midnight and there weren't many sounds for Wes to hear, aside from the slumbering doctor next to him and the constant white-noise provided by the jungle outside. But that is when the young man notices something rather odd; for the amount of dreariness provided by the constant rains and the hanging jungle canopy, there appears to be a great deal of ambient light flooding through the villa's windows...
*******************************************************************************
Jareth partook sparingly of the previous night's offerings, preferring quiet solitude to the raucous good times going about the Temple. When the time comes, he retires to the room in the manor provided to him by Jakira, catching up on his contemplative meditation and a fair bit of sleep.
Suddenly, a dark presence floods his thoughts, shaking him violently from sleep. It isn't the same as the terrible nightmares he suffers, no this is a living presence and one that is attempting to creep forward without being noticed. Through the scout's previous training as a Jedi, he knows the essence of a Sith when he feels one, and it is coming from somewhere just above the Manor. Jareth can see an odd light filtering through his window, and can hear a faint humming, but the source of both would require further investigation...
*******************************************************************************
***"Oh, you wanna speak to the boss huh? Hold on, let me go find my other cap here…"**
Kurr hear's the sounds of the Dockmaster walking away from his comm, and then some scrabbling and shuffling of items in the background before someone returns. The voice sounds exactly the same as the one that left just a moment ago.
**"The Boss here! And guess what?! I hope your farking ship *explodes* with you in it, fix it your kriffin' self!"**
There's a bit more expletive-laden grumbling before the commlink rather violently cuts out on the pirate, and he's left with an awkward silence.*
~~~~~~~~
With the worry of how to fix his ship still fresh in his mind, but the promise of a great deal of credits to come in the morning, Kurr takes full advantage of the Solsian offerings, favoring an alcoholic beverage that manages to simultaneously freeze the tongue and burn the throat on it's way down. With a jug of that brew, and a pair of nubile and eager young Hobben women, the old Pirate whiles the night away.
It is just beyond the ass-crack of night when Kurr's commlink begins a furious chirping. Fuzzy-brained and bloodshot of eye (or as bloodshot a glowing red cybernetic eye can get), the Feeorin casts about for his commlink, the chronometer on it showing just past 1am, local standard time. The commlink continues its furious buzzing, and the signal indicates that the communique is coming from the *No Chance*.
The *No Chance*, where Kurr had left Al'verde to guard and work on his speeder bike for the night. The commlink continues it's urgent beeping, to the pirate's ears drowning out the sounds of the two sweethearts dozing behind him and the ever-present jungle chorus.

Laying on his back upon the big bed Wes slept soundly. The events of the day before and especially the evening had made the impending sleep welcome. Yet something wasn't right. He awoke startled, almost fully awake. He looked aound but saw no on in the room or heard anything either. But he felt something and this was a new experience for him. A presence was near and it left him with a feeling that something bad was going to happen. Someone was near than their presence here was wrong within the peaceful area of the villa.
He look to his left and saw Jakira lying there on his arm. Her light pink hair was tousled and stood out in contrast to her crimson skin. Their bodies, still undressed, were half covered by the sheets. He smiled as he recalled the events from just several hours earlier.
Despite the memory of their lovemaking, and wanting to stay by her warm body, he quickly and gently he excised his arm from under her head and shoulders. Moving to the side of the bed he stood and reached for his carbine that was leaning against the nightstand. The Chrono said it was only an hour past midnight. Too early to really get up but the feeling he felt compelled him into action.
Looking to the large picture window that had the drapes mostly drawn he saw a bright light shining in from the opening. Moving quickly to the window he looked out only to see light filtering down through the jungle canopy. **"That's too much light for just the moon to be showing through. Someone is here."**
He turned and called out to Jakira as he walked to the bed. **"Jakira, wake up!"** He unceremoniously kicked the foot of the bed to help roust her. **"Jakira get up! Something is really wrong. I think feel a presence and it's not a good thing."**
He looked around the room. With the increased light coming in from outside he spotted something familiar. His armor, he didn't even know it was here. He smiled as he looked at her finally waking up. ***Hmm, makes me wonder if she was planning this all along. I have to admit I like a woman who knows what she wants.***
**"Jakira now please. I think someone is here close by."** He said a bit louder as he quickly searched for the undergarment he was given earlier amongst the pile of clothes that had made. Finding and putting it on quickly he made way over to his armor and started putting it on. It was like an old habit donning the armor, a second skin so to speak. It was only a few minutes till he stood carbine in one hand and his helmet in the other.
Turning around he looked at Jakira. The warm friendly demeanor she has come to know in the last few hours was mostly gone. His posture was relaxed, ready to explode at a moments notice. The set of his chin and facial features were taunt. The only thing that was the same as earlier was the light in his eyes. That would never change.

When Wes leaves the bed, Jakira, still unawares at first of what is happening, rolls over taking the emptied space Wes had once occupied. Murmuring something unintelligible in her sleep, she continues to sleep for a moment. It doesn't take her long to realize that Wes had left the bed and she watches him for a moment as he looks out the window. She lets out a soft sigh of contentment as she watches the warrior partake of the view. Half dozing, she's jolted back to wakefulness when Wes unceremoniously kicks the bed and calls her name. The words sounding like nonsense in her half awake state didn't rouse her his tone, serious and desperate for her to awaken definitely caught her attention.
Sitting up in the bed, unabashed by the amount of skin she's showing she rubs the remaining sleep out of the bed. She watches as Wes proceeds to rummage through the pile of clothes at the foot of the bed, separating their clothes in his search for his under garments. "**Who? What?**" she asks confused. *What was he talking about? Who was close by?* "**How do you know?**" She looks over to her pile of clothes where the commlink still resides in her pocket. If something was happening she would have been paged. With a glance at the chrono she lets out another sigh when she discovers the lateness of the hour.
When he goes for his armor, she decides it would be best to follow suit. Climbing out of bed she goes for the pile of discarded clothes and begins the process of dressing. Finally, she turns around to face him and her expression turns into one of stunned surprise. She should have expected it, but in his armor his demeanor was ever more menacing, deadly. Here in front of her was all the proof she needed that this man was a battle hardened warrior.
"**Jareth's in a guest room on the other side of the hearth room… If there's trouble he'll be able to help,**" she says, stuttering at first from the shock. "**What should I tell my people?**"

"Who? What?" She asked confused still half asleep. "How do you know?" She added as he found the article of clothing he was looking or and quickly put it on.
He spoke as he pit it on covering up his nakedness not that it mattered. **"I'm not sure. It's like before when we felt the power coming from the chamber."** He had moved to his armor and started with that as he continued to explain. **"Only this time its different. It feels wrong, dark. Like evil was coming to visit."**
Turning around he saw that she had dressed quickly and was ready to go. ***Good less time I'll have to wait.*** He thought as he saw the surprised look on her face. Now she was seeing the other side of him. He wondered if it would change how she viewed him as other women had always figured him to be a cold heartless warrior. That assumption was far from the mark.
She stuttered a bit as she spoke regaining her composure. Jareth was in one of here in the villa in one of the guest rooms. "What should I tell my people?"
He looked at her as he donned his helmet. The HUD came up quickly as all systems reported condition green. The armors environmental systems kicked in and began to regulate the temperature inside the armor. His voice was now slightly altered as it came from the helmet's augmented speaker. **"Tell them something bad is coming. Perhaps even death itself."** He wasn't embellishing either as that was how it felt to him. And while he would never let her see it, the feeling unnerved him slightly. **"Grab a weapon if you have one."** With the suggestion his thumb clicked the power setting back to kill on his carbine. What ever was coming didn't need to be stunned.
He turned and walked to the door he had closed only hours ago to afford them their privacy from those that may also be in the villa. Entering the hearth room his optics package activated and adjusted for the low light conditions of the area as he made his way to the room Jakira had indicated.
Not bothering to knock he opened the door. **"Time to move Jareth. Company is coming. I don't believe it's the friendly kind either."** he left the doorway wide open as he moved back towards Jakira. **"You know the area better then I do. Where to, back to the hospital proper?"**

Grumbling from his slumber, the feeorin pirate stumbled to his feet and clicked on the commlink. **"Oi,"** he growled in his half-slumbered mind, **"Whattya want, eh?"** Looking back to the women he left snoozing in the bed, Kurr reached down and grabbed his clothes and gear, dressing himself as he attempted to make a dash to the door. From the sounds of it, a dead man was aboard his ship and Kurr intended on finding out who. Making his way into the Hearth room, he noticed Wes dashing back and ran over to him. **"What th' gristin' hell is goin' on, Mate?"** Kurr growled.

Jakira stands at the foot of the bed, stunned at the suddenness. *Come on Jakira. You didn't freeze up like this when the Sith came.. Sith… The archive!* What other reason would someone have to come at the dead of night to do harm other than to attempt to catch her hiding Hobben guests. Hiding possibly unawares to the likely danger.
Moving with purpose now she walks toward her bureau. Opening one drawer then another she finally locates her prize when Wes reemerges from the hearth room. She turns, the drawers beside her in severe disaray. The small hold-out blaster resting awkwardly in her hand. The only weapon she had ever thought to buy seems like a joke next to the deadly Mandalorian before her.
"**Wes… The archive. The Elders. If it's the Sith that's where they will go.**" Course there was very little doubt in her mind that's who it was. The dread on her expression, she hopes, explains it all. She had protected them once with Jareth's help. Moving them to the hospital and Oraltor's relatively abandoned archive. More had joined the Elders as even mere children weren't safe from being collected by their Sith oppressors. She and Jareth had done their best to offer them protection. *Have they discovered this is where they've been hiding? After all this time how did they find out?*

He saw the small hold out that she held. They awkward way it was held told Wes it wasn't an often used item. When he looked up from her hands he was surprised at what he saw. Fear and dread were written across her beautiful face. "Wes... The archive. The Elders. If it's the Sith that's where they will go."
He blink but of course she couldn't see that now. ***The Sith of course. It makes sense now. Is it them that I am feeling? Is that possible?***
**"The Warmaster!"** He said hurriedly. **"If we felt him, untrained as we are, then they surely can as well. I can't let that knowledge fall into the Sith's hands."** He held out his hand motioning for her to come along. **"We need to move now if we want to make sure the Elders are safe and recover the Warmaster."** He pointed to her hold-out. **"It would be best if you hid that. If it's Sith it won't be much use out in the open. Your best tactic will be surprise. Lets go."**
He ran for the villa door that would take them to the path that lead to the hospital. He looked for Jareth as he moved through the hearth room. They were going to need all the help they could get.

Wes was right of course, the thought they might have felt the Warmaster hadn’t crossed her mind. Of course, Wes also didn’t seem to comprehend there was more than just the Warmaster at stake. Jakira takes his hand when he offers it and as they move she tries to figure out a place to hide it as she speaks in spurts, trying to catch her breath as the hurry. “**The others, Wes. The Voice, the Elders, and the others hiding in the archive… They’re Force Sensitive… They’ve been hiding because the Sith have been … rounding them up for horrible things…**” Her tight pants didn’t leave much room to effectively hide the small pistol, so she figured that was out of the question. And her top was also too revealing to be effective either. And her belt was probably too obvious a hiding place. Finally as they stop at the door to glance for Jareth she tucks it into top of her boot. That would just have to do.
From her pocket she pulls out her commlink and provides the signal for the most perilous of danger. Clicking her commlink twice she hopes the guards are not caught unawares. In quick, short spurts she begins giving orders. Evacuation of patients, alerting those in the archive of the danger. It was a fortress down there, but she knew if it came down to a battle there they would be trapped.
Now outside she could see what it was that had drawn Wes into action. Coming in through the canopy above was a bright light. Something was definitely coming.

As the night wore on, Jareth tossed in his bed as a familiar but unknown demonic aura filled his entire being. He rose from his bed in a cold sweat, staring out the window as trepidation crept upon him. He slowly garbed himself, taking meticulous care with every piece of equipment he placed on his body. The final piece in which he had to don took him the longest, as it was not just another tool or weapon, but an extension of one's self: A manifestation of ideals.
"**Time to move Jareth. Company is coming. I don't believe it's the friendly kind either**."
With the devilish image embedded in his mind like a stone, he finally reached for his lightsaber and tucked it away into a concealed holster; its touch cold, and unfriendly. Taking a deep breath, he quickly moved out of the room and in search of his companions. After a few seconds, he bumped into the gathering and followed them through the hearth room.
"**Yeah, I feel it too. It's coming from somewhere above the manor. I don't think we have much time. I know i'm probably beatin' a dead taun-taun when I say this, but I hope everyone is ready for a confrontation**."
Nodding to himself for reassurance, he slung his sporting rifle into his hands and ventured out with the armored Mandolorian to thwart an unwanted visitor. Jareth then reached out through to the life that is in and around him; the steady *patter* of rain and sounds of the jungle becoming somewhat of a soothing effect for an otherwise chaotic mind and racing heart.

They were met in the hearth room by Jareth who sported the same rifle he did before. At the young
mans question if they were ready for a confrontation was actually chuckled which was heard by both.
He looked quickly at Jareth. **"Are you kidding?"** Wes didn't wait for an answer as he keyed his comm and brought up Kurr's frequency. **"Kurr it's Wes. There's trouble inbound. I'm not sure where you are but we may need a hand. We're either going to need a way out or help to stand and fight."**

The sounds of close quarters combat and the dull clacking of heavy steel on plastoid polymer greet Kurr as he opens his commlink. A great deal of static accompanies the feed, but at long last the gruff voice of Al'verde comes on the line, although it is garbled by the static interference at best.
**"Imps try-ing to steal-*sscccrreeecchhh* your ship. Wo-on't let'm. Ho-ow the kri-*scccrreeeccchh* long do- it take to an-er a com anyway-*ssscccrreeeccchhhh*?"**
Kurr's commlink cuts out, and any further attempts to raise either the No Chance or Al'verde directly are met with a piercing static. It is becoming readily apparent that communications going into or out of the vicinity of the Temple are being jammed.
*******************************************************************************
Jakira's efforts are met with a similar resistance, although solitary communication comes through on her commlink, the message blood-chilling in its singular clarity.
**"Surrender in the name of Emperor Krayt, or be destroyed!"**
What follows is a shout of defiance in the Hobben language before blaster fire erupts, and the comm channel is filled with the anguished screams of the injured and dying. Just as suddenly as the clarity is gained, the commlink ceases its transmission and those gathered in the hearth room are met with a dreadful silence.
*******************************************************************************
Nestil and Rehn join the rest in the hearth room, along with those household staff members that had been in the manor overnight. The light outside the mansion gains in intensity until nearly every detail glimpsed through the curtained windows is embossed in stark relief. Inside of the hearth room, all is cast in coruscating shadows, and the distant humming noise draws closer and closer until it resolves itself into the roaring blast of repulsorlift engines.
**"Where are you, you whore of a false Emperor?! I can smell your stink from here!!"**
The vile challenge emanates from a loud speaker as it echoes loudly all around the manor. Although the memory is somewhat foggy to Wes, he can remember the screeching voice as belonging to the blond beauty that had attempted to capture him during his initial awakening onboard the Wheel.
**"I would have preferred to do this the *fun* way Jakira,"** the porcine chuckle that accompanies the statement marks the speaker as none other than Governor Radge Rothke.
**"But your little *betrayal* has left me no choice. You're harboring stolen Imperial goods, and Agent Nassio tracked your fugitive friends half across the Rim to here to recover them. Call off your primitive beast-men and surrender yourself to my mercy, and none else have to die here… More than necessary, of course."**
A snap-hissing sound startles Rehn and the Hobben laborers as Nestil ignites her silvered lightsaber. As Wes moves forward for a quick reconnoiter through the door, the Imperial Knight takes up a flanking position to one-side of the door frame, nodding to Wes that she would cover him. Just when the Mandalorian pokes his head through the portal, a blaster shot rings out, targetted at Wes's armored knee. It is only through Nestil's Force-honed reflexes that the sniper shot is deflected, but the maneuver buys Wes enough time to gain a tactical lay of the land.
...And what he sees pisses a bantha's load of piddle on an otherwise incredible night.
**"How about this: if the Imperial Knight bitch comes out here to die at my hand, I'll only take the crusty Mandalorian, the coffin, and the idiot Jedi and the rest of you may go free! Isn't that a wonderful compromise? Am I not merciful?"**
Agent Nassio's sadistic laughter booms from the loudspeaker, causing the Hobben in the hearth room to cover their ears in fright.
**((Special <!– s=> –>![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!– s=> –> We're not in combat rounds just yet, there's a decision to be made here! Respond accordingly, and we'll see what the night brings. ;-)))**

Coming back from the open door to more practical cover Wes is glad for his helmet. The situation outside was not good, not good at all. they were trapped inside the villa surrounded and heavily out numbered. ***Karking hell this isn't good. My day started out bad, gotten real good and has now gotten worse that it was when it started.***  He looked at Jakira. The people she cared for were being hunted down and slaughtered. He knew this wasn't easy for her.
He looked at the assembled group. **"We're not going out that way."** The tone of his voice left no doubt in what he saw. **"There's at least a half dozen troopers outside along with a heavily armed transport. They also have prisoners. Some alive, some I couldn't tell. If there were Hobben guards out there they have all been captured or killed. There's also that blond chakaar that was trying to grab me on the Wheel. She's with someone who could give a Hutt a run for size."** 
They were in a tight spot. He looked at Jakira. **"Is there another way out? A way to get to the chamber so we can recover… "** As he spoke he noticed that something wasn't right. She seemed unsteady on her feet. He watched as he color drained from her crimson skin. When her eyes begin to roll he moved quickly to her side catching her around the waist with his free arm. He held her easily as he called her name. **"Jakira what's wrong? Jakira!"** There was an ottoman near by. It was the one he had pushed out of the way when She had begun to give him the tour of the villa. Letting his carbine swing from his shoulder he gently moved her to it allowing her to sit upon it. He knelt down keeping a hand on her in order to keep her from falling over.

## Re: Chapter 2: Way Down in the Jungle Deep

### **Alicia** (2010-08-10 00:53:44)

Jakira sways on her feet as a deluge of emotions overwhelm her senses. All the fear and vicious satisfaction threaten to take hold of her sanity. Wes's words wash over her, made into a reality by the emotions she was feeling from outside. She could feel the Hobben prisoners' terror as well as the Hobbens being hunted from within the temple and the pain of the guards who were left to die a painful death.
Her pallor grows pale, a light red in comparison to her usual crimson, and her eyes roll back into her head as she loses all control. Just for the moment. From somewhere, she doesn't know how, comes relief, a resolve, the strength to fight on. "**Mahchen**," she murmurs, her voice growing stronger as he grants her some of his own strength. His words overwrite the mocking ultimatum the beings outside provide. *The Ali'la is with us, and we will fight. What will you have us do?*
"**Mahchen…. what's happening?**," she says again. Someone was calling her name and her eyes flutter open to see Wes kneeling next to her as she sat on an ottoman. *How did I get here* she asks herself in a delirious moment. This was the second time in a span of a day she had almost fainted and the fact seemed to annoy her for a moment. But they were for some reason overwritten by the caring touch of the Mandalorian as he held her upright.
Leaning forward slightly she allowed her forehead to rest on Wes's, the cool touch of his helmet turning into a blessed relief. She could still feel the tumultuous emotions coming from the temple, but now thanks to Mahchen she had found some balance, some peace. "**I'm fine**," she says at last. "**I think.**" Still confused over the matter she wasn't about to push the subject any further. "**Mahchen, the Voice, and the others are in the Archive. They haven't been found yet,**" she pauses a moment as her strength finally returns. "**Wes, they could escape into the jungle with the Warmaster…**" she says giving him an option. There is, however, one thing she is keeping from him as she utters those words. If Mahchen had really been speaking to her through the Force -*yes… that seems right* - then they were also willing to fight back. As a pit begins to grow in her stomach, she fears if they fight, they wouldn't survive.
There was probably only one thing she could do to protect the Hobben in the hospital now. The Sith after all weren't after the Hobben she had here, not directly anyways. Right now they were just bystanders. The Sith wanted her, Wes, Oraltor and the Warmaster. Looking at Wes, she knew there was no way he would be surrendering himself over to them, and they would only get Oraltor if they caught him. It wasn't necessary for them to surrender to save the Hobben if the governor kept to his word. And that was the hitch. The only question keeping her from walking out that door.

Kneeling next to her with one armored hand on her back he felt her recover somewhat from whatever had afflicted her. He didn't know what had happened to her but he felt her right herself so he removed one hand from her to take up his weapon again. He breathed a sigh of relief no no one could hear it, an added benefit of being able to turn off the mic inside the helmet.
At her mention of the Malchen and the others that were in the archive he nodded. ***Good they will probably be alright for a few minutes but mot much more than that.*** He knew that even with the Ithorian Jedi down there they would be wiped out if it came to conflict.
"Wes, they could escape into the jungle with the Warmaster..." She was about to say more but she stopped and no more words came. He cocked his head a bit as he looked at her.
***Running into the jungle might work. It might get a lot of them killed but it's better than staying here and dying without doing anything.*** He watched as she was thinking quickly. ***She's hiding something and this isn't the time for that. It'll cost more lives.*** If his face was visible she would see the furrowed arch to his eyebrows.
He stayed on one knee as he spoke to her. **"What are you not telling us? The longer we take the less chance we have of getting out of this. If the elders and the Oraltor can get out and escape into the jungle than that's better odds than staying here. Here they will be captured or killed. Out there they may still die but they will at least have a chance.**
He stood up and took a step back and looked around. As he gaze came across the patio door he remembered that over the patio wall lead to the jungle. At least that's what it looked liked. He didn't really have much of a chance to dawdle at the door as his hostess had other plans. ***We're going to have to run. Karking hell I hate running. But to die here or to be captured would be pointless. Best to try and escape and be a thorn in their side for another day.***
His gaze returned to her from the patio door. **"Over the patio wall will take us to the jungle correct? That looks to be out only option."** As he spoke the powerful light from the transport moved from left to right across the exterior of the manor. He made a motion with his carbine to what was outside. **"That transport has enough firepower to level this manor in the blink of an eye. We can't stay here, if we do we might as well make our peace now. I have no fear of dying in battle but I'd rather it not be today."** The tone in his voice didn't waver as he finished speaking. It was true for the Mandalorian did not fear death from battle.

"What are you not telling us?" Wes asks her and the Zeltron woman blinks at him. Of course he would see that she wasn't telling him everything. "**Wes… I won't abandon the others,**" she says, unsure if he hears her as he stands and moves to look at the patio door.
Having already realized she would probably never be coming back to this manor, her home, she stands. At first unsteady on her feet she is soon quickly walking into her room. Purposefully she begins gathering the rest of her gear. Her medical supplies she had placed in a frame to be carried on her back, the surgery and minitaturized medical kit stacked ontop of each other, but still manageable. The personal items she can't abandon she quickly puts into a bag.
She looks around her bedroom for a moment before rejoining the others in the hearth room. "**It's the Sith, Kurr,**" she says, having finally learned his name. Turning back to Wes, she addresses his question. "**There's two options to get out of the manor.. The lift which will take you into the hospital or over the balcony which will take you onto the hospital's lawn where you can then slip out into the jungle.**" Her mind is made up now, she couldn't live with herself if she didn't try. Even though she knows she will be giving up her own life on the hope the governor would hold to his word.

With the sounds of battle, and maniacal laughter ringing in his ears, Jareth immediately sprints toward a nearby window next to the villa door and ducks for cover. "**Bantha podoo. We're in a tight spot.**" With his back against the small part of the wall for cover, he holds his gun in his lap and turns his head towards Wes. "**One of the sith out there has some blasted device that is probably making him or her stronger in the force and is gonna give us some trouble. If we slip out into the jungle, I can be of some help, since i've survived it a time or two.**" He shoots Jakira a grim smile and slips his right hand towards his rifle.
"**Whatever we do, we should hurry. That blonde's patience is probably running out.**" He then moves part of the curtain to one side and sneaks a quick peak out the window.

Wes heard Kurr talking behind him as he watched Jakira sit there on the ottoman Still a little shaken from the events. Turning slightly he could see that Kurr was frustrated. It was plain as day in his voice. He wanted Rehn and Oraltor. Probably to make sure he got his creds. He couldn't blame him. Wes had no credits for this new time he was in. He could use them too.
**"I know Kurr. You know as much about this place as I do. She knows the layout."** When Kurr hefted the pair of grenades he nodded. **"Good we'll need those."**
Her voice brought him back around. "Wes... I won't abandon the others," She said quietly maybe even to no one in particular even though she used his name. She stood, at first a bit unsteady, but became more surefooted as she moved. He watched her walk away. The hips that moved seductively just hours ago no longer did so. They were replaced now with quick strides as she entered her room. He stood there watching her go as his mind raced. ***She's going to do it. She's going to give herself to the Governor.*** He thought as he watched her enter the room where they had only just left moments before. ***They won't keep their word Jakira It will be all for naught.***
**"Stang!"** He said to no one in particular as he looked around at the others that were gathered. Jareth had moved off to a window to take a peak. **"They have two sharp shooters out there Jareth. No more exposure then you have to."** He said curtly. **"Alright what do we have for offensive power other than the grenades Kurr was thoughtful enough to bring?"** He looked around the Hobben staff that were here would not be helpful. Even now they were scared. He couldn't blame them though. From what he had heard from Nestil and Al'verde the Sith were cruel and just plain pure evil. Nothing they said could be believed. They would tell you what you wanted to hear only to pull the blade when you weren't looking and stab you in the back with it. ***Much like the Vongese were in the war. Best get your mind into that line of thinking again Wes when it comes to these Sith. That is if you want your shebs out of this in one piece.***
Oh his HUD he spotted Jakira emerge from her room. Gear and supplies were in hand while look on her face said it all as she advanced and walked passed him to stand between him and the door. Explaining to Kurr as she walked past. She turned back and looked at him answering his question about how to get out. "...The lift which will take you into the hospital or over the balcony which will take you onto the hospital's lawn where you can then slip out into the jungle." He noticed it when she had said it. You. Not we can get out. He wondered if the others caught it as well.
She stepped closer to her. **"Jakira they won't keep their word even if you go out there to them. That Hutt slime of a man out there even said it himself. '…surrender yourself to my mercy, and none else have to die here… More than necessary, of course.' Any Hobben that isn't already dead most likely soon will be soon, even if you go out there. The ones that have run off already have the best chance of surviving."** He stopped for a moment to look at her to make sure he had her attention. Despite the helmet his voice softened for a moment. **"Sacrificing yourself today wont change what's happening here. If the jungle is as bad as I hear we're going to need your help when we go."** He watched her face as he spoke to see if he was reaching her. He was fearful that she had already made her decision and nothing he or anyone said would make a difference.

**"Durn right, Mate!"** Kurr said, agreeing with Wes' assessment on his grenades. Listening in on what Jakira was saying, the pirate grinned. **"Right, so we lookin' t' toss a distraction down th' stairs an' head fer th' trees? Sounds as gud a plan as any…"** he stated, pulling his rifle around and powering up. **"But we best make ar way t' the Nae Chance as quickly as possible.

"**They have two sharp shooters out there Jareth. No more exposure then you have to.**"
Jareth took heed of the Mandolorian's thoughtful words and carefully moved away from the window.
"**Right. Since the front door option is a no-go, the jungle is looking really good about now. Jakira, I wouldn't trust the sith or the governor as far as I could throw 'em. Don't needlessly throw away your life on the chance that scum-bucket Rothke will keep his word. Your sacrifice won't bring back the lives of the hobben that have died for us and this place of sanctuary. What was destroyed can be rebuilt. Our friends deaths won't be in vain, trust me.**"
As an added measure, Jareth charged his sporting rifle so that the weapon was primed and ready in his hands. With some hesitation, the young man grabbed for something concealed near his right leg but at the last second he withdrew his hand back toward his rifle in a battle of willpower to which he lost. Then with grim determination, Jareth left in the direction of the balcony to catch up with Kurr.

Jakira looks between the two men. A part of her knew they were right, she was only praying there was still a chance she could save what she could. The fear and pain from those around her were driving her to this action for she couldn't stand to feel their suffering any longer. Her head ducking into a grief as she realized they were right. There was nothing assured in her planned action except making things worse for her and for the others gathered in the room.
Well, if she couldn't save those outside, she'd be damned if she didn't make sure they would survive into the coming days. She may not be a fighter but she knew these people and though she didn't know the jungle as intimately as Jareth, she knew enough about what they would need to survive it. Moving away from Wes, she approaches the huddled Hobben. A proud people, these specimens seemed to be reduced to cowering under the might of the Sith outside.
With a stern voice she begins coaxing them into action in there own language, forcing them up when the refused to be coaxed. "**You**," she said urging her two Hobben attendants into movement. "**Start scouring the kitchens for anything we will need in the jungle.**" As the two Hobben girls Kurr had been celebrating appear, she urges them into the kitchen as well. "**Go help them gather supplies,**" she says. With the Hobbens finally on task she heads for her linen closet, pulling out sheets and anything else which could be used as makeshift carryalls. She too then heads for the kitchen to help with the sorting of any supplies the ladies have pulled.
Turning to look back before she enters the kitchen she says to others, "**I hope you have a plan**." Not waiting for any confirmation she gets back to work, disappearing behind the kitchen door.

Jakira stood there between him and the door. Wes wasn't sure if he and Jareth had gotten through to her or not and he didn't like his options if she decided to make a run for it. When it came to people needlessly throwing their lives away he didn't understand it. But everyone was different. He found that out during the war.
It looked as if she was battling with some inner demon when finally he saw her make a decision. When her head fell he was about to make a grab in an attempt to stop he from going outside but she surprised him by moving away from him and the door back to the interior of the manor.
With a voice that seemed charged she began speaking to the Hobben in their language getting them moving as she followed them into the kitchen ***One crisis averted.***
Before getting there she turned. "I hope you have a plan." She didn't wait for an answer as she entered the kitchen.
With the four Hobben now hurrying around Wes looked at the others. They needed to get out and the quickest way seemed to be the elevator to the hospital. He motioned for the others to come closer. **"Alright the quickest way to get out of here unseen and unexposed looks to be the elevator."**  He looked to kitchen and back. There were ten of them that had to get out of the manor. He hopped that it would hold them all with whatever supplies they were taking. **"Jakira said the elders have a way out of the temple that's beneath the hospital proper. From there we an grab whoever and whatever else we need and make a break for the jungle."**
He turned to Rehn. The Zeltron could now see his reflection on the Mandalorians helmet. **"Go check the elevator. Make sure we can lock it down as soon as the door closes. Last thing we need is for them to be crawling up our shebs as we make our break."**  As the Zelton moved away he looked at the other three that were there with him.
He looked at Nestil her lightsaber still lit. Its silvery glow casting shadows over all of them. **"I wish we had another like you with us at the moment. We could use another batting away any shots that will be directed at us. When we get off the elevator be ready. When we move out bring up the rear. Kurr,"** Wes looked at the Pirate. **"Stick with her and cover her as best you can. Jareth,"**  He looked at the young man who held a rifle. **"Up front with me. We can keep Jakira and the Hobben between the us as we make our way to the stairs that lead to the temple below ground. Rehn can help out wherever needed. Questions?"**
He looked at all of them and nodded. **"Ib'tuur jatne tuur ash'ad kyr'amur. Today is a good day for someone else to die."** He translated for them as he walked a few paces towards the kitchen. Placing a black armored hand on the door he gave it a push causing it to swing inward to the room. **"How much longer?"** He said with a tone that didn't leave much room for interpretation. They needed to move now.

For a brief moment, the feeorin contemplated who'd died and made Wes the man in charge ... but then he realized that the mandalorian had more combat experience than he'd had, especially considering that his was limited to raiding ships and not anything that anyone would consider "fair". **"Roight!"** Kurr nodded to Wes and turned to Nestil, **"Guess yer with me, Sweetcheeks, eh?"** With a KA-CHUK followed by a whir of power, the pirate cocked his sporting rifle and prepared for the worse. **"Make sure we get th' Hammerhead out,"** he stated back to Wes, **"There's far too much cred to be leavin' him behind, eh?"** With that said, Kurr smiled wildly and prepared for the worse ...

In the kitchen, Jakira continues to cajole and mediate between the women as they rush around grabbing food and other useful items. While her attendents scoure the kitchen for the items leaving cabinets and drawers open in their search, Jakira and the two girls who had been with Kurr begin preparing the slings which would serve as the carryalls for the supplies. Sprawled out in some semblance of order are the six sheets she had pulled from the closet, folded and knotted a good foot in as they go about arranging things to be tied shut. Jakira figures there's enough food to last all ten of them the next few days at the very least.
She frowns as she notices a pot or two make it into the assortment of supplies as well as knives and other kitchen utensils. Grabbing the first aid kit she packs it too in one of the make shift satchels. Behind her she heard the creak of the door as it swung open. "How much longer?" Wes asks and without stopping in her work comes up with a short reply. "**Not long. I think we've gotten all we can.**" Standing she begins helping to put the satchels on the ladies, leaving two needing to be carried by the others. "**Is there a plan? Is it the elevator or the patio?**" she hoped it wasn't the patio, she never did like climbing. With the five of them working together, they satchels were quickly tied on and two of the women grabbed the remaining satchels and took them out into the main room to find the volunteers to carry them.
Adjusting her own pack of medical supplies on her back, Jakira moves to join Wes at the door. Things were as ready as she could hope to make them on her part.

As the door swung open, and his question asked, he was greeted to a kitchen in chaos. The five women were doing their best to grab what was deemed necessary for their flight into the jungle. Jakira head down was quickly putting items into a make shift satchels as she directed the Hobben women to grab specific things.
Without a hitch she answered as she shoved something he could not see into her satchel. He nodded as she stood helping the Hobben women get ready to go. "Is there a plan? Is it the elevator or the patio?"
He quickly ran through the plan as the five women were quick and were ready to go. He watched the four Hobben women filed out with two extra satchels for others to carry. He was sure that they would find others to help carry them in the temple. Looking back Jakira had moved to his side. Her pack settled on her back as she looked ready to go. He noticed a drop of sweat as it trickled down her long crimson neck. **"Lets go then."** He turned as began to walk to the elevator as he motioned for the others to follow. **"I have Rehn checking the elevator now to see if he can lock out the controls so they cant follow us. You and the four Hobben will be in the middle as much as possible so we can cover you. Make sure they know that if they break rank…"** He paused just for a second pondering his next words so that they didn't sound quite so harsh. **"Just make sure they know that their safety is with us."**
The finality of his tone was surprising almost to him as he found himself shifting more into the role that his armor personified. Their situation was dire. They could not afford to be chasing down others that strayed. If they tried to they would all be caught and killed, or worse.
**"I seriously hope the elevator is big enough for all of us and what were taking. Other wise we'll be split up."** He said as he looked behind him to the manor's main door. He looked at her. The plan was in motion, the question that nagged him was, what were the Sith going to do to ruin it?

Jakira didn't doubt it would hold all of them, they were designed, after all, to hold a medical bed. It may be a tight fit, not impossible. Making her way toward the lift she pulls out her code cylinder, showing it to Wes as she explains. "**I can lock it down, sort of… Hospital lifts have a Code Blue setting. I can call the lift here and they'll have a hard time stopping it. We can take it anywhere we want, non stop and it will be locked till the command is lifted**."
Looking over Rehn's shoulder she takes a look to see how far the Zeltron scoundrel got in taking apart the control panel which calls the lift.

**"I'm not hearing the response I'm looking for Jakira! Take the children and the able-bodied to the mines! Any *choice* female specimens shall be taken to my estate for… *civic* duty. Haha!"**
Through the open windows and the front door, the sounds of dull thuds and fleshy-smacks as the impish Governor takes Jakira's lack of a response out on the Hobben. Each whimper and cry of pain is followed by a sadistic laugh from Rothke and Agent Nassio both. Suddenly, one of the vile cackles turns into a screech of outrage.
**"I can sense you moving, vermin! Fine! If you'll not accept my generosity, then we do things the hard way! Clear that house commander, I'll take whatever's left to my mistress!"**
The Sith Assassin's words are followed by an affirmation, and then a sharp hiss and keening wail. Wes knows the report of a mortar launch when he hears one, and just as he throws himself in front of Jakira, shielding her from the worst, all of the windows in the hearth room are blown out by a massive concussive blast that rocks the manor to its foundations. Kurr, Rehn, and the Hobben avoid the worst of the explosion with a few minor scrapes, while Jareth and Nestil are thrown from their feet violently, although the Jedi manages to roll with a survivors toughness. **(6 pts of damage to Wes, 3 pts of damage to Jareth b/c of Evasion)**
The atmosphere then comes alive with discharged plasma, as a torrent of blaster fire sprays through the manor's walls, thicker than Solsian rain. Much of the blaster fire is dispersed by the villa's thick walls, but that meager protection is waning quickly. The salvation of the elevator does not lay far off, but the going will be treacherous and all together lethal.

**"Get t' th' lift!"** Kurr barked, un-pinning a frag grenade from his bandolier and hefting it towards the entryway opposite the lift. **"Fire in th' hole,"** he growled. **"See ya in hell, ya Sith-Suckin' bospoors …"** While Kurr had no love for the Imperials, he had even less for the Sith. Not waiting for an explosion, the feeorin turned and moved towards the lift, ensuring that everyone else got on board first. *Try an' b' a nice guy and see where it lands ya, ya kiffin' slug-spawn.

As the Governor and the Sith woman taunted them from the outside he saw Jakira turn around. He watched as her emotions took over. Fists balled, skin tone changed. She takes a step as if to go outside again to give herself up. It was then that Wes heard the acknowledgment of the order an order given and the sound that followed. Moving quickly he took two side steps and positioned himself between Jakira and direction of the incoming mortar.
The Manor was rocked on its foundation by the blast. His armor reacted automatically as it cut down the decibels to a manageable level but the others took the brunt. The following concussive wave washed over them as he put an arm around Jakira to steady her. He groaned a bit as he felt hot shards of glass and building debris get by the softer sections of his armor which was mostly at the joints. He felt a trickle of blood trail its way down the same shoulder that Jakira had just patched up. This time though it was the back and not the front. ***Another scar to the collection.***
He looked around in an attempt to take stock in their situation and ask the others if they needed help but he never got the chance as the troopers outside opened up with blaster fire that was mostly stopped by the manor walls. Despite their thickness they weakened quickly.
With the one arm around her middle, her body was pressed against his armor. She seemed to be in shock from the assault. He had to get her moving. To do that he figured he had to play to her desire to protect the Hobben. Thankfully there were four in the room. **"Jakira we have to help them get to the lift. What they are carrying is burdening them too much. They need help."** Turning her around to the nearest Hobben woman he pointed. **"She needs your help!"** Unceremoniously he pushed her towards the woman.
From the side he heard and saw Kurr's voice his displeasure as he tossed one of his grenades at the door way. ***Good the rush will be coming next that may slow them down just enough.*** Staying close to Jakira as he helped the one of the other Hobben women. With an armored fist he grabbed part of the satchel she was carrying to help her along. Doing what he could to protect them. **"Hurry up, they'll begin the rush next!"** He yelled to whomever could still hear him in the manor.

Next to Wes, Jakira begins to shake upon hearing the cries of the Hobben outside, the lewd remarks of the governor, and the raucous laughter of the Sith agent. Whether in barely controlled anger, grief, or a shared terror, maybe even a combination of all three, her skin once again turns a darker shade of crimson and her fists ball at her sides. Taking a step towards the door, she's unaware if she's doing this in some vain hope to reach out to them. She's stopped as Wes grabs her and puts her behind him as the stormtroppers outside begin blasting through the walls of the villa. Letting out a small shriek she covers her ears at the cacophony of noise from the mortars and the following blaster barrages.
Pressed against Wes, she felt safe, but still she knew that the danger was only beginning. They were going to sweep in and kill anyone who got in their way. Wes was turning her, saying something about the Hobben needing her, and then with a shove he was moving her towards one of her attendants. She knew, then, what it was she had to do. They had to get out and the lift was the only way.
Pulling the woman into cover, she takes the satchel from her attendant. "**We'll make a run for it,**" she says, making her attendant focus on her again. Looking over at Wes, she gives him a small nod and then pulling the woman with her begins to make a dash for the safety of the lift.

"**Yeah, th-**" He is immediately cut off and promptly thrown by a devestating explosion that nearly destroys the manor. Jareth slowly lifts his head as vision becomes very blurry. He can barely hear the sounds of his companions as he violently coughs from the debris left from the blast. As he finally comes to his senses, everyone near the young man can hear the hiss of a weapon come quickly to life. A yellow radiance fills the room as Jareth comes to the aid of one of the hobben women.
"**Well, the party is officially over. Haul it to th' lift! I'll cover you as best I can.**" Without further delay, the scout shields the closest hobben woman as he brings his weapon to bear in an inverted grip. Everything around him becomes but a distant thought, as he attunes himself to the power of the force. He keeps a free hand on the hobben lady as she makes his way to the elevator, letting his feelings guide him through the destruction and chaos surrounding the manor instead of relying on his base senses.
OOC: Going for option C here: Shielding her while moving at her pace, helping her to make difficult terrain checks and providing maximum cover for the both of us.

The atmosphere is ablaze with laser fire and the smells of scorched plaster and burning ozone as the valiant heroes desperately try to make their way into the relative safety of the elevator.
*******************************************************************************
Wes and Jakira shield their two Hobben women with their bodies as they hustle them towards the lift's opening, the hellacious rain of plasma and the explosion of rockets just outside the manor threatens to take each of them from their feet at every turn, but the Zeltron and the Mandalorian doggedly continue their advance. Jareth takes the much slower, but a great deal safer, path and barbwire-shimmies across the floor with his ward, while Kurr lobs a grenade through the entrance to cover their escape.
Half-way to the elevator, the woman that Wes is protecting cries out and slips, twisting her ankle painfully on a rug thrown haphazardly about. This causes the Mandalorian to falter as well, and just as he does a blaster bolt catches him solidly in the thigh nearly bringing him down on top of her. But he-who-would-be a Knight is made of sterner stuff then that, and summoning some reserve of strength from somewhere, makes it into the relative cover of the elevator, along with the hobbling form of his Hobben woman. **(20 pts of damage to Wes)**
*******************************************************************************
Jakira, more dexterous than her armored hunk of man, cuts a much smaller profile as she weaves through what once was her living room in an effort to save herself and the woman beneath her. As another explosion rocks the villa, she and her charge are thrown from their feet over a nearby hassock, launching them into the air over the furniture. Just before hitting the ground, Jakira improbably manages to roll and shield the Hobben woman with her body, using the moment to then roll both to their feet and scurry on. One of the women that had stayed the night with Kurr cries out and is suddenly silenced, a hail of blaster fire ending her song forever.
The Hobben woman enters the Elevator ahead of Jakira, gibbering praises of all kinds to the doctor, but just as Jakira responds with a weary smile, a stray blaster bolt stabs her through the back, coming out her should a scant few inches away from her heart. The heat from the bolt cauterizes the wound, but Jakira slumps, hurt badly by the shot but still alive and kicking. A shrieking and blubbering mess, the Hobben woman pulls Jakira out of view of the elevator opening, cradling the doctor in her arms. **(20 pts of damage to Jakira, -1 on the condition track)**
*******************************************************************************
Kurr goes for broke, cursing the Sith-led Imperials to all manner of hell before chucking a grenade through the front entrance. All is silent and still for the blink of an eye, before shouts of "Grenade!" are heard and an ear-splitting explosion rips through the front of the manor, nearly tossing the Feeorin from the front door all the way to the elevator. A shuttering and grating is heard, like slabs of stone shearing and grinding against one another, and the front of Jakira's house begins to collapse, along with the stone of the Temple ceiling beneath it.
Picking himself up with a smile, the Pirate makes a show of dusting himself off and then swaggering into the Elevator. Nestil and Rehn follow after him, the former using her Lightsaber to shield the entrance as best she can, the latter cursing violently somewhere out of the way. **(Kurr causes 35 pts of damage, as well as likely making Jakira more pissed at him)**
*******************************************************************************
Jareth grinds his way across the floor, his armored knees carving deep gouges in the once-expensive wood floor. He shields the Hobben woman with his body as he goes, using his free hand to deflect as many blaster bolts and bits of debris as he can with his lightsaber. The Jedi manages to keep himself and the woman mostly free of harm, aside from the unavoidable bruise and scratch.
Suddenly, after Kurr's grenade, a chandelier hanging over head swings lose, plummeting end over end towards the woman that Jareth tries to protect. The Hobben screams and raises her hands to shield herself, but Jareth calls upon the Force in his time of need, throwing the Chandelier aside. They continue to struggle across the floor, making a slow, but steady advance.
*******************************************************************************
**((BEGIN COMBAT ROUNDS))**
Way Down in the Jungle Deep, &quot;The Ambush&quot; Round <strong>#1</strong>
-Jareth 24
-Kurr 19
-Wes 19

**((SPECIAL <!– s=> –>![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!– s=> –> Because of Kurr's grenade, the blaster fire has lessened considerably, but is still present.

With blaster fire erupting all around them Wes and his charge manage to make it half way to the elevator. Just when he believes that they will make it there unscathed the Hobben woman stumbles. Attempting to keep her from falling he grabs her by the clothing on her back and manages to keep her on her feet. In doing doing so he stumbles when he stepped on a piece of debris caused by the mortar only seconds before.
What happened next almost took him the his knee as a blaster bolt caught him solidly on the thigh. His step hitched has he practically willed his leg to keep moving and not crumple from the pain or damage. With a loud grunt of pain he righted himself. He knew that if it hadn't been for his armor the shot may have taken his leg clean off.
Passing the threshold of the elevator door Wes half guided/pushed the Hobben woman to the back right corner that provided some cover from the onslaught that was outside.
Turning around he used the elevator doors as cover as he brought up his carbine. Jakira and another Hobben who's leading her were crossing into the elevator. ***Good their safe.*** He thought as Jakira was just about in. All of a sudden she lurches looking to his side he sees the wound that is now visible. Unable to get to her he sees the Hobben grab her as she slump while being pulled from the elevator opening. **"Is she ok?"** He yelled over the sound of the battle. ***That was a bad hit*** Concern rose in him as he saw her being held by the other woman. Not having time to think about it he decided to answer back in kind lest the rest have the same thing happen. As Jareth was still out there.
Lifting his carbine to return fire he surveyed the mess outside as, Kurr and the rest, minus Jareth, file into the elevator. The grenade that Kurr let fly seemed to have forestalled some of the blaster fire they were taking but it wouldn't last long. Remembering that Kurr was carrying two grenades Wes yelled. **"Kurr, grenade on the left."** As he took aim on the right to put the two Imperial troopers that were standing up. With a flick of his thumb he selects the burst fire mode. If either was the one that shot Jakira all the better.
OOC:
Standard action to attack - autofire (-5 to hit)
Ranged: Blaster carbine +3 (3d8+7)

Taking several deep breaths, Jakira attempts to detach herself from the pain. Unable to get a good look at the wound inflicted on her, the awkward bending of her shoulder sending stabs of pain through her body causes her to hiss. She's pleased, however, to note that the wound had been cauterized, though, the vain part of her realizes she's likely to have a nasty looking scar marring her visage.
Continuing to take deep steady breaths, she takes stock of those around her. Only two of the Hobben women had made it to safety so far. Her attendant and the one she had rescued blubbering over Jakira as she rested in the woman's lap. Wes caught her attention next. He was hurt, she could see it in how he attempted to take all the weight off his leg. His armor prevented her from perceiving the extend of the injury, but from the large scorch mark she supposes he's lucky to still have the limb.
"**I'm fine,**" she lies to the Hobben woman and then adds sternly. "**Stop your blubbering.**" Pulling the cylinder from her pocket she holds it up with her uninjured arm, though she still grimaces with some pain as the muscles stretch in her chest. "**Rehn! Here…**" She prayed that the cylinder would do its job and get them to the level they wanted in safety. She wasn't sure how much more of this they could take.
(( Swift for 2nd wind - 10hp , swift for 1/3 recovery, if handing the cylinder off to Rehn doesn't cost an action I'll take a 2nd recovery action ))

Getting into the elevator, Kurr narrowed his eyes at the oncoming troops. Hearing Wes, Kurr just nodded in response, pulling another frag grenade from his bandolier. **"Fire in th' hole,"** he growled as the pirate hoisted the grenade toward the troops on the left. **"C'mon, Mate!"** The feeorin yelled to Jareth, **"Get a move on er you'll be playin' host t' this lot, eh?"** Looking to Rehn, Kurr added, **"Creds better b' there Pinkie … er else we're gunna have erselves a conversation, eh?"**

With blaster fire, yells, and choas all around, Jareth falls deeper within himself. He slowly puts one foot in front of the other, concentrating solely on the safety of the hobben woman and the elevator; which is a planet-length away. In mid-crawl, the hobben woman barks a sharp command and points towards the sky as a large chandelier hurdles towards them. He stops briefly and holds out a hand towards the obstacle. The thing shudders, then crashes harmlessly to the right of him and the hobben woman.
**"Don't worry, we're gonna get to that blasted elevator"** He resumes his slow march, placing one elbow in front of the other. Something catches his eye as he glances off to the right. He then stops his foward motion as his concentration is shattered. **"It can't be. Liana!?"** Mental images assult the jedi as he stares at the prone body of a dead Hobben woman laying among the debris. He finally manages to shake off his delirium and doggedly continues along the path. As the hobben woman near the scout tries to speak, he quickly cuts her off with a wave. Looking at the his face was evidence enough that the time for talking has long passed.

The stormtroopers roll to their feet with a soldier's toughness, training their blaster rifles on the occupants of the turbolift and letting fly. A hail of red-hot death coats the interior of elevator, some stray bolts echoing around the cars mirror-finished interior, but luckily not striking a single soul.
Kurr, subscribing to the **"There's no such thing as too many grenades"** school of though, pulls another frag grenade from his bandoleer and tosses it through the now ever-expanding hole in the front of Jakira's manor, aiming for another pair of stormtroopers. Another sharp explosion rocks the remnants of the house, and pits of plastoid-shelled humanoid go scattering in multiple directions. **(11 damage to stormtroopers, two stormtroopers down)**
*******************************************************************************
Peaking from behind the cover of the elevator's opening, Wes braces the blaster carbine against his shoulder and unleashes a torrent of hellfire on the two remaining stormtroopers to his right. The stormtroopers, well-trained soldiers of the Empire that they are, duck behind whatever positional cover they can find as the blaster fire eats through what remains of the villa's front wall.
Wes manages to singe a few scorch marks on the armor of the stormtroopers, but veteran troopers remain mostly unscathed and singling in on a new target.
*******************************************************************************
Targeting reticules and threat indicators bob and constantly update with information on the heads-up display of the two black-armored stormtroopers, as they brace themselves on the deck of the hovering troop transport. A flash gleams off the barrels of the two sniper rifles as the spotlight shifts to illuminate the villa's crumbling interior, and when the targeting reticules line up on Kurr and Wes, the blasters howl a scorching report.
Wes spies the flashing muzzles and ducks back inside the elevator at just the last moment, a blaster bolt stabbing through the space he had just occupied. Kurr, perhaps swaggering a little too long over his handy work, is thrown back into the elevator car, the sniper shot scorching a piece out of the Feeorin's ear and taking the tips of a few of his tendrils along with it. **(15 damage to Kurr)** 
*******************************************************************************
The Hobben woman stifles her tears as Jakira rebukes her, a hand scrubbing at her eyes to dry them. A steel returns to the Hobben women huddled in the elevator as they see their doctor soldiering on through the pain to keep fighting. These women are from a proud and enduring people, and they show it as they one begins to encourage Jareth and his charge while the other helps tend to Jakira's wound. **((Jakira gains 1 extra swift action for the purposes of recovery next round))**
*******************************************************************************
Not knowing what just happened to Jareth, the woman under his arm does understand that he is doing his all to save her life and so she continues to scrabble and claw across the floor of the crumbling villa towards the salvation of the elevator's opening.
Both Jareth and the Hobben watch as a fist-sized sphere launches from the elevator on a parabolic trajectory towards the stormtroopers assaulting the manor. The scout, knowing screaming piece of Impending Doom when he sees it, covers the woman as much as he can without crushing her, awaiting the explosion. The explosion doesn't disappoint as timbers snap and stone fractures just behind them, causing the villa to pitch forward as the heavy stone supporting it sustains further damage.
Determined, the scout starts forward again, but suddenly another aftershock shakes the ground and the world begins to tilt as the floor beneath Jareth begins an agonizingly slow slide into the floor Temple floor beneath. Both Jareth and the Hobben fall back into the beginning arc of a freefall, the woman screaming as they threaten to plummet nearly two stories down and with the threat of being crushed to death by rubble.
His mind spinning rabidly, all the world seems to slow to a glacial pace as the Force rushes into Jareth, focusing his mind and sharpening his senses. At the last moment, he lances out to latch on to a shred of rug hooked onto a broken crossbeam with one hand, the other grasping the hand of the Hobben woman in a crushing grip. The world resumes its normal pace, and the sounds of battle and chaos roar into the human's ears, as a terrible aching begins in Jareth's shoulders from the combined strain.
Jareth's strength failing, he manages to swing and then throw the Hobben woman up to the intact portion of the floor, the woman rolling and crawling until she reaches the front of the Elevator. That leaves Jareth clinging to the quickly-shredding scrap of rug, his willpower and determination remaining stalwart in the face of his predicament, but his grip slowly fading...
*******************************************************************************
**"See you down below! Start circling this dump Rothke, shoot any *thing* that tries to escape!"**
The blond assassin gives the dangling Jedi a perfectly devilish wink and a cackle of maniacal laughter, before she jumps down into the sinkhole in front of her, leaping from jutting debris to falling rubble with an incredible agility until she has disappeared below.
Radge Rothke gives those in the elevator a wave with his pudgy hand before he scrabble-climbs back into the troop transport and it begins to gain altitude.

Doing their best, the pair contuined on their way toward the lift. As they were just about to reach the elevator, Kurr's grenade flies through the air and lands near their vicinity. **"Watch it**!" Trusting in the force once more, the jedi covered the hobben woman as best as he can as the grenade rocked the very foundation of the manor. Jareth then gritted his teeth as debris and wood launched into his unprotected side. He snorted, then grabbed the woman by the hand and continued forward by force of will. As the duo began making more progress, the floor beneth them suddenly collapsed with an audible groan, plummenting the both of them toward certain death. He flailed wildly and lashed out towards anything that will stop the fall. With a smuggler's own luck, his hand find purchase on a wool rug. Holding on with all the strength he can muster, he swung toward the elevator. With enough momentum, Jareth released the hand of the hobben woman just in time for the woman to climb up unto the floor in relative safety. The woman paused before resuming her march toward the elevator to look in the eyes of jedi who just saved her life.
"**Don't stop ya karkin' idiot! keep going to the lifts, i'll be along shortly**" With his strength ebbing, Jareth started to panic as he gazed down into the gloomy darkness below. On the cusp of life and death, the young man closed his eyes and recalled the words of his master Nirran when he was faced with a similar predicament.
"**'So you're just gonna give up and die then, huh? Let me tell you something right now that you should carry on with ya the rest of ya life. I've met a lot of strong jedi and you're pretty good for ya age. But the strongest is never strong enough to be always the master unless he transforms that strength into honor; his emotion into duty. These principles are like fuel to them, motivation. Dying is the easy path and never an option for the strongest. The path to calling yourself a Jedi is never easy.'** "
*Why can't anything ever be frickin' easy? Haven't I done enough? I just want to live!* The young man nearly growled at his last thought, and started to slowly put hand over hand in an attempt to climb his way back up to safety; his eyes smoldering with renewed vigor, and his panic forgotten.
OOC: Going to climb up the rug here. Using a force point on the endurance check.

Wes swore to himself as his barrage on the two troopers failed to have any effect other than causing them to seek cover. The transport was now lifting off taking the two snipers with them. That was the good part. The bad simply overwhelmed the good. As Jareth seemed to be holding on to a rug that was looking as if it was about to give way. Add to that the blond Sith was coming for them. Yes the bad far outweighed the good at the moment.
His mind raced on what to do. To leave the elevator was certain death. To leave him there was certain death for Jareth either from the falling rubble or the Imperial Sith. Looking at Kurr he saw the Feeroin looking for something to use. What they needed was rope to toss to him. Wes began smiling beneath his helmet. With his left hand he reached down to his utility belt. There, clipped on, was the cable dispenser. Removing it quickly he tossed it to Kurr yelling for his attention. Not waiting to see if he caught it he looked back out as the transport was lifting past the angle where the two Snipers would have line of sight to their position. That left the two troopers still in side.
Wit both hands now back on his carbine he angled out to take a shots on the troopers. Figuring that it may be best have the troopers keep their heads down he switched to suppression fire.

Jakira could feel the rumbling of the manor as the floor begins to buckle. She heard the scream of fright from the last of the Hobben women still in the firing zone of the manor. From her angle on the floor she has a hard time seeing what exactly is happening to her. Taking a few more moments and with the aid of her Hobben attendant the pain in her chest eases slightly, enough that she's able to stand with the woman's help. The weight of the pack of medical supplies causing her injured shoulder to twinge, but she fights past it. Soon enough when this was all over she could take care of it properly.
"See you down below! Start circling this dump Rothke, shoot any thing that tries to escape!" she hears the woman shout and then subsequently the sound of the repolsurcraft powering up. *Oh no… They could find the others,* she thinks in a crazed moment. Wes she knew was hoping to make it there in time, but she wasn't sure. There were still more troopers in the building, what if they couldn't reach them in time for all of them to make an escape? There were just far too many ifs.
Closing her eyes, leaning against the safety of the lift wall, she fights to push aside all the fear and distraction of the battle raging just outside. If Mahchen had been able to reach her, could she do the same? Would he hear her? Taking deep breaths she tries to envision Mahchen as he had presented himself in what seemed like ages ago, quietly meditating in the bowels of the temple in the archive. Unable to focus enough to send him a thought like Mahchen had sent to her, she's only able to imprint an image of the Warmaster standing beside him. Her fear and worry over their potential capture interrupts any verbal message she might have sent. Instead she holds it in her mind, urging Mahchen to get it, and understand.

*Ah hell,* Kurr thought. Catching the dispenser that Wes tossed him, the feeorin thought for a moment before taking a lead and tying it firmly around a good weighted piece of small rubble. **"Oi!"** he shouted to the Mandalorian as he tossed him the tethered rubble to Jareth, keeping the feed open. **"Cover me, eh?"** Kurr shouted to Wes and tossed the line to Jareth. **"Grab th' line, Mate!"** he yelled, while bracing himself against the elevator wall.

Jareth, with his strength ebbing and the muscles in his shoulders beginning to ache, finds the strength of will to hang on, his grip on the carpet becoming vice-like. Slowly, he begins a determined climb up the rug, hand-over-hand, but as he makes it half-way up, the fabric shreds even further and he's sent dangling right back to where he started. **(1 FP used)**
*******************************************************************************
The pair of stormtroopers pop-up from behind their cover, taking aim and unleashing a torrent of blaster fire on Wes and Kurr's entrenched position, the passing blaster bolts leaving a trail of burnt ozone and scorched metal.
The Mandalorian stares down the muzzle of one of the stormtroopers, knowing the enemy's aim to be true, and as he prepares to inhale what may be his last breath, a lance of red plasma bearing down on him like a true-shot arrow, a silver lightsaber blade springs up and deflects the bolt, scarring Wes's helmet right along where his cheek would be. **(Saved *exactly* by Nestil's deflection bonus to AC)**
**"That is twice now Mandalorian. You owe me."**
Nestil smirks up at Wes, the tatters of her cloak flapping in the breeze as an flow of air drifts in from the now-incredibly drafty front of the manor. Raising his carbine, the Mandalorian rains down a hail of suppression fire like lightning bolts hurled by an angry god, and wherever they encounter rubble the stormtroopers are using for cover, it is disintegrated.
One of the stormtroopers cries out in pain, and then bends double over his obscuring-bit of brick and mortar, his awkward pose showing that he lived no more. Adjacent to him, blaster bolt-after-blaster bolt pierce through the stone, and a bloody-red mist sprays into the air, but nothing can be seen of the stormtrooper hiding behind it. **(26 pts of damage to stormtroopers)**
A crackle of thunder and a flash of lightning splits the sky, joining the ambient light afforded by the trooper carrier's spotlight. It begins to rain in furious sheets, the rainwater blowing deep into the manor and beginning to drench everything and everyone inside.
*******************************************************************************
Kurr weights the end of the liquid cable, twirling it over head to get a good gain momentum before casting it down to Jareth. The weighted end of the lifeline clonks Jareth solidly in his helmeted-head, nearly knocking the Jedi from his precarious perch, but leaving it easily in reach.
With the Feeorin anchoring the line, and Wes able to lend a hand now that there were no more visible threats, they are both able to haul in the giant, clanking catch that is the scout. As Jareth is pulled over the lip of the sinkhole, the rug he had been clinging to rips free and flutters into the darkness below, a great deal of the surrounding debris going along with it. When the Jedi crawls forward into the elevator, the Hobben woman he had saved rushes out to him, hugging him tightly around the neck and then using the grip to help drag him into the lift.
*******************************************************************************
The pain in Jakira's shoulder subsides to a dull throbbing as she stands, gaining a better vantage of the scene. Her beautiful home lays in object ruin, massive holes and fissures pocking the front wall and the floor, while all her windows are now nothing more than empty frames and spider-webbed glass. She sees Jareth scramble towards the entrance of the turbolift, and the Hobben woman he had been protecting run out to aid him, while Kurr and Wes stand in various battle-worn states. The crimson-armored Imperial Knight kneels, her silver-bladed lightsaber held in a defensive guard, while toward the back of the lift Rehn crouches, preparing to get the lift moving at a moment's notice.
As Jakira reaches out with her feelings, a warm, familiar presence meets her, pulling her in and more firmly establishing their connection. Mahchen's thoughts surround and calm her, and as she relays the the emotions and mental images, she feels one simple, pure emotion coming from the Voice:
Resolve.
***We will take the Ancestral Warrior and escape into the jungle. Do not despair Jakira, we will endure through this all. Survive.***
The doctor catches mental images of Oraltor buzzing around the archive, gathering as much of his collection as he can carry while the two dozen or so Force-Sensitive Hobben do the same. When all is prepared, they run to the Archives far wall, and manipulating a series of stones, they reveal another hidden entrance. Before they all enter and are away, Jakira catches a flash of Mahchen's eyes, now covered in a sheen of furious storm clouds, then the images and the presence is gone.
*******************************************************************************
**"OK, everyone here now? Good, 'cause if you ain't I don't care anymore!"**
Rehn pipes up from where he cowers as Jareth is firmly within the threshold along with the others. They had only lost one of their original number, the Hobben woman blazed down in the initial assault as everyone made their escape. The lift doors close, their golden sheen pock-marked with blaster burns and puncture holes from debris, but the machinery is still functional, and with a shuddering start the turbolift shuttles its way down into the Temple's depths.
...Where both freedom and darkness await.

## Re: Chapter 2: Way Down in the Jungle Deep

### **Yogi** (2010-08-19 11:17:11)

Blaster fire began ripping its way into the elevator from the pair of Stormtroopers outside. Bringing up his carbine to answer back he saw the trooper that had a bead on him. Experience told him that his enemy had him dead to rights. Not flinching he began to take aim. If he was going to die here so was the enemy.
As the trooper fired things slowed time seemed to slow. He watched as he was beaten to the trigger. A red lance of death spead for him. He was gong to die here. He hoped that the others and Jakira especially, got out of the temple safely.
A bright silvery flash came streaking by in front of his hemlet. Nestil had managed to deflect the blaster bolt. thought not fully as the bolt was merely altered in is hunt for death. New blast scoring now decorated his helmet right where his left sheet would be.
"That is twice now Mandalorian. You owe me." He heard Nestil prod him. He saw the smirk and figured it to be in jest. Grunting back he thanked her. **"I'm glad you can keep count."**
Bringing his carbine fully to his shoulder he answered back. Still on auto the rapport of his weapon was constant as death rained down upon the two who were scrambling for cover that was soon obliterated. With the smell of ozone heavy in the confines of the elevator the Mandalorian looks out only to be greeted by a flash of lightning and a crack of thunder.
With the immediate threat of blaster fire gone Wes sets about helping Kurr. Securing the liquid cable dispenser back to his belt. acting as another anchor in the attempt to get Jareth from his perilous situation. with a heave Kurr managed to pull the Jedi free. Stepping out and offering a free hand to the young man Wes helps him into the elevator.
With everyone in and Rehn making a case for going which the warrior agreed with. The doors began closing. and with a unsure start began its decent.
Exhaling he leaned against the gold colored wall. He shifted a bit to take the weight off his injured leg. The hit wasn't to bad but he was going to have a scorch mark there for sure. He reached down and adjusted teh armor plate that was there so it didn't rub the wound the wrong way.
**"Everyone in one piece?"** He was asking as his gaze took in everyone. Jakira and Kurr both took bad hits with the doctors being far worse. He checked his weapon. With the charge still good he took an easy step with his leg. It wasn't too bad. He'd still be able to run if needed. And if he was right they were going to be running for their lives before the night was over.
He looked at Jakira as the elevator continued its decent the new blast scoring on his helmet was very evident. There was a slight hint of mirth in his voice **"An elevator, from the hospital to the manor interesting."** He paused for a second figuring she get his drift but continued quickly with his tone shifting as he was back to the business at hand. **"Where does the elevator open in relation to the stairs that take us to the temple?"**

There's a small smile of relief gracing Jakira's features as Wes turns to look at her. Still leaning against the wall of the lift, for a moment she looks completely at peace, but then she seems to be lifted from the spell and is fully aware of her surroundings once more. Blinking, her eyes open and she takes in the others. Everyone but the one Hobben had survived, and she was saddened for a moment that she didn't know the girl's name. Then, steeling herself with resolve she turns to the living. Kurr was injured and there was still her wound and Wes's which needed some attention.
"**I need help with my pack,**" she says. It was probably going to hurt to get it off, but she had to get to her gear. She nods a thanks to the one who helps her ease it off and then pulling out the first aid kit she had retrieved from the kitchen gets to work staunching the bleeding from Kurr's tendrils and ear. Glancing at Wes she asks, "**How's the leg?**" Tossing the used gauze aside she applies the same sticky substance she had used on Wes to the wounds, sealing them as she answers Wes's question in return.
"**The lift will let us out at the back of the temple in the central hallway. We'll need to get to the storage bay near the front of the temple to get to the archive.**" Unsure whether she should reveal the others had already left she allows the information to mull around for a moment as she concentrates on sealing Kurr's wound. "**The others won't be there when we arrive.**"

**"Ah … easy there, eh?"** Kurr growled as Jakira looked him over. **"I ain't as sterdee as th' Mandie there."** The pirate winced again, his mind flashing back to the slap-jack of a doctor that installed his eye after his accident. *Least this one ain't hard t' look at, eh?* He grinned, which flexed the skin wrong and caused a dull pain to strike a nerve. Wincing one again, he asked Jakira, **"Oi! Ya usin' tape er staples there? Maybe next ya'll b' usin' one o' th' sabers t' cauterize it, eh?"**

## Re: Chapter 2: Way Down in the Jungle Deep

### **Yogi** (2010-08-21 01:04:00)

Jakira didn't answer his question right away as he watches her prepare for one of the things she does best. He saw the grimace of pain as her pack came off with help from one of the Hobben women. Quickly opening her pack retrieving her kit she set to work on Kurr whom he saw take a good hit. Watching her move with quickness and purpose he realized they were lucky to have her with them. She glanced up at him as she worked. "How's the leg?"
He looked down at the other new blast scoring that decorated his leg armor as he gingerly shifted his weight to the injured leg. A slight grunt was heard by those in the lift. "I've had worse. If you have time to look at it, fine. If not it can wait till were out of here." Giving him a quick nod as she began applying the same substance that he has on his shoulder. As she worked she answered his question.
He didn't like the answer. It meant that they could be exposed as they moved from the back to the front of the temple. ***And now with that Sith chakaar on the ground. We may run across her.*** He thought to himself. He was about to ask her how far and what was in their way from end to end when she added something. "The others won't be there when we arrive."
Giving a slight nod his helmet followed suit. **"Grabbing the important stuff and heading to the jungle? Good. Smaller groups will be harder for them to spot. As long as we have a way of meeting up it shouldn't be a problem."**
As the elevator was continuing its decent he looked at all of the others. Some were worse for wear but their were no major injuries yet. Though that could change as there was still a lot of ground to cover till they were out of here. **"Alright when that door opens same positions as I said as before. Jareth,"** Wes said to the young man **"I'm assuming that you know your way to the stairs from the lift here. Since you're up front with me you get to lead the way or at least point it out as we go. We're going to need to move quickly. The Imperials have boots on the ground and we're not sure exactly where their at. We move quickly and the chance of getting boxed in lessens."**

Jakira gives Wes a nod to answer his question as she proceeds to apply the glue despite his protests. "**Hold still Kurr, or you'll find your tendrils glued to your head for a week,**" she threatens honestly. Finishing with Kurr she tells him what she did Wes as she closes the lid on the blue glue, "**Don't mess with it till it dries, which shouldn't take long. It will dissolve on its own and help with the healing process. Try and keep it dry too.**" Satisfied her work with Kurr was done she moves onto Wes.
"**I need you to take the plate off so I can look at it**," she says as she moves to kneel next to him her kit in hand, wincing slightly as she bends. If his wound was the same as her's it had been cauterized already. At least that's what she hoped, otherwise it was possible he had been steadily bleeding since he had received it. Looking at the area around the plate, however, she didn't notice any signs this was the case.

Wes watched as Jakira was administering care to Kurr quickly and effectively. Weather she knew it or not she made a good field medic. Wrapping up with Kurr she Was then turning to him. "I need you to take the plate off so I can look at it,"
She held her kit in hand as she knelt down. There was a noticanle wince of pain but she worked through it. Knowing time was short he was about to tell her to not bother. Seeing the look on her face he remembered something she had said only hours before. *"One way or another I tend to get what I want"* Seeing the look upon her face he knew this was one of those times.
Nodding he let his carbine swing free on it's strap while reaching down with both hands to loosen and finally remove the armor plate. **"It's not to bad. I think the plate took most of the hit."** He said as the plate came away revealing a nasty blaster burn but no blood. **"See it's not too bad"** He said as he put weight on it but quickly took it off.

Turning his nose at the smell of the glue, the feeorin had an urge to pick at the glue. **"So how long this gunna take, eh? An' how sticky is it? If we head inta th' jungle, poodo gunna stick t' me?"** Kurr said, questioning the doctor's means. **"Ya ever thought 'bout servin' on a ship, lass? I'm sure we culd use sumone with yer skills 'board th' *No Chance*, eh?"** He smirked a bit, causing him to also wince as the glue was just setting and caused the skin to pull some. Gritting his teeth, he tried not to show the pain and instead asked, **"So what's th' gristin' deal with ya, Wes? Everyone takes ya as th' second comin' o' Talon Frakkin' Kard, eh?"**

Even though she couldn't see Wes's face of pain as he shifted his weight on it, the fact he couldn't keep it on meant that it was going to hinder him down the line. That was all they needed, was for his leg to give out under him while they were trying to make their retreat. Getting to work she applied a numbing antiseptic and putting a bacta infused gauze pad over it wrapped it with a bandage. At least this way too he'd be able to put the plate back over it without inflicting more damage. Finally pulling out a needle and checking the contents, she quickly gave him the painkiller before he could object about it.
As she works she gives Kurr a quick glance over her shoulder. "**Even if I was interested, you could never afford to pay my fees. More so if this is the norm of work you'd expect.**" She says casually. Not that she'd ever consider leaving on a normal day, but considering recent events, she was now possibly going to be wanted woman. It was possible she may never be able to come back here to rebuild what had become her life's work.

The pirate chuckled. **"Ya sure 'bout that, Doc?

Nae t' mention it'd also give ya sum protection. Mebbe ya didnna notice, but between yer boyfriend there an' I, we jus' saved yar tail, eh?"** Some how, he had a feeling this could backfire on him and waited for the inevitable fact that, while he did help save her, he also was one of the main reasons her house might be in shambles now. The pirate stifled a chuckle as he tried to look intent on his end of the arguement ...

As Jakira began working on his leg now that the armor plate was now off He looked at Kurr as the pirate began asking questions to both Jakria and himself. Those in the elevator heard him give a half chuckle. **"It's turning out to be a long story Kurr. One I don't even have the whole story on yet."** He paused for a minute. **"Talon Karrde huh? Even here in the future he's still a legend huh?"**
Under his helmet he making a slight face as Jakria began applying the numbing agent before the bacta patch. Even thought it hurt he didn't move his leg the slightest amount. At her quick comment to Kurr about working on the *No chance* He smiled behind his helmet. From what he had been able to learn about her earlier she wasn't your typical woman. Looking down when he felt a jabbing pain in his leg where he had been shot he sees her removing a needle from his thigh. **"Thanks Jakira but I didn't need the pain killer. If it's hurting I still know it's there and working. If it's numb I'm more likely to favor it as I can't feel it."** It was too late though as it was already done. Still he gave her a nod of thanks. **"I guess now I owe you double."** Although she couldn't see his smile it was conveyed in his voice.
Reaching down with both hands he began reattaching the plate over the newly acquired bacta patch. He shifted his weight to his injured leg to see how it felt. He began rocking back and forth as Kurr started in Jakira again about working on the ship and having some protection. He even went as far as to call him her boyfriend. His eyebrows raised quickly. Thanks to his helmet no one could see where he was looking at that precise moment. He leaned back against the wall and waited for it to happen. ***This might be bad.*** He thought as his eyes shifted between the two of them. His helmet never moved.

The Zeltron doctor's hands stop in their task of putting her tools away, her skin turning a darker shade of red as her ire began to build up. "**Saved my tail?!**" she says incredulously. Standing, the pain only seems to drive her on as she takes one step and then another toward the Feeorin, her finger jabbing at him as she speaks. "**My *tail* wouldn't need saving if someone hadn't led that psycho bitch here. How do you think she knew to come here? Huh? Because she followed *your blasted ship***!" Her tone crescendos with each word, and by the time she's done she's crossed to where Kurr stands and her finger left jabbing into his chest to accentuate the last few words.
Her anger leaves her heaving for air, the dull ache in her shoulder forgotten during the outburst, but now returns. Her color begins to return to normal with her emotions vented. But she doesn't turn around from Kurr, waiting to see what else this smart mouthed nerfherder had as a retort.

**"*My Ship?*"** Kurr growled back at Jakira, his mechanical clicking to a halt on her. **"Look here, Toots, if it wurn't fer yer Hammerheaded buddy, nun o' us wuld b' in this mess!"** The feeorin's mechanical eye whirred to a stop, focusing on the doctor with a fiery red intensity. **"I think yar misunderstandin' a few things here, Toots, I came here 'cause I wuz promised creds … an' wuld've been happily on m' way if it weren't fer yer horny friends an' you gettin' in my gristin' way frum collectin' said creds, eh? An', in all honesty, if ya were so bloody worried 'bout sumone like that 'psycho bitch', why th' GRISTIN' HELL DID YA SURROUND YARSELF WITH A BUNCHA DEFENSELESS TARGETS?! THIS AIN'T MY BAGGAGE …*TOOTS* … IT'S YAR'S!"**
Looking to Wes, the pirate barked from closed teeth, **"Ya'd better get yar girlfriend t' realize th' reality she's found herself in, eh? I may b' scum, Mate, but I at least make sure I surround m'self with folks I kin count on an' know th' stakes … nae th' blood o' innocents."**

As the shouting stared Wes came off the wall. ***Scratch the might be bad Wes. It's blown past that by several steps.*** He was thinking as he saw Jakira planting her finger into Kurr's chest with just about every word. Noticing that her anger seemed to be short lived as he noticed her color returning to normal a well as he breathing.
He looked at Kurr again his helmet didn't move. ***Let it be Kurr, let it be. You have no idea what she has lost here today.*** His thought was cut short as the pirate began in anew. He stepped forward almost between them as this had gone on long enough. Their lives were in dire straights and they decided to have a pissing contest in the middle of it.
**"Enough!"** His voice boomed out from his helmet as he dialed up the speaker. The anger in his voice was evident even if they couldn't see his face. Looking between them his helmet didn't angle towards one more than the other. **"You both know what's at stake here but it's for your own reasoning to determine the worth."** He looked at Kurr **"Creds for you…"**  Then turning his helmet to Jakira. **"..and what you have worked very hard to build up on your own."**
He let a breath escape. He was standing equally on both legs. The dull pain that was his leg was now forgotten because of these two. his voice wasn't as loud as before but the tension was still there. **"If you two want to continue this pissing match after we get out of here, have at it. If you want to do it now you might as well stay here and have that Sith bitch referee for you. I think she would enjoy that. When this door opens I'm moving with the others you two can decide what you want to do.** He let a calming breath escape. **"I'm just trying to get you all out of here alive."**
He turned to Kurr as he took up his carbine. **"And for the record…** his pause was ever so short. **"She is not my girlfriend. I think even you can understand two people taking comfort in each others arms for a night."** He stepped back to the door that would soon open. He would be ready to go with the others. If Kurr and Jakira weren't that was their problem.
**"Jareth, be ready to point out the way."** The cool, calm, collected voice that was always behind the helmet had again returned.

As Kurr's rant build, Jakira's color begins to darken once more, but her own retort is cut off as Wes steps in, breaking up their squabble. She takes a step back as Wes gets between them, turning away and crossing her arms so she didn't have to look at the Feeorin who had gotten her so worked up. Wes was right of course, this wasn't the time nor the place. Any moment the door to the lift would open and they'd be making their retreat to safety. A part of her wondered if there was going to be such a thing as safety as long as she was around them, after all, they were the reason that that woman had come and destroyed her home and killed or taken so many of the innocent Hobben who had found their way here.
She didn't say anything, not trusting herself not to lash out in anger at the two men, as she turns completely away and goes back to packing up her tools so she would be ready when it was time. Taking care of her own wound would just have to wait at this point. With a grunt and a grimace of discomfort she puts her pack of medical supplies back on her back and goes to stand at the back of the lift, opposite and away from Kurr.

Seething not unlike a chastised teen, Kurr shot a glance to Jakira. **"Yar *boyfriend* has a point, eh?"** He grumbled towards the doctor. **"If we're t' survive, we'll need t' b' workin' together … hell, fer all we gristin' know, that Sith-Spawn is th' one pullin' our strings, eh? How 'bout we settle this aboard th' *No Chance*, eh?"** He offered his hand to the doctor, saying, **"Whattya say? D'we have an accord?"**

Standing there Wes faced the door. As Jakira retreats to gather up her stuff he wanted to turn around to make sure she was alright. He had learned a few things about her during their brief time together. If anyone was loosing anything here this night it was her and she was loosing it in spades. He didn't though he just looked forward.
Closing his eyes he tried relaxed a bit. Gathering his wits about him putting the emotions of the two out of his mind. The fight that was to come once the door opened wouldn't care about what had just happened.
He listened to those in the elevator with him. The breathing and quiet talking from the three Hobben women could be heard. He didn't understand their language but he was sure that the outburst from Kurr and Jakira has made them wonder if they would be surviving the next few moments.
Nestil and Rehn were keeping quiet. It was uncommon for the Imperial Knight but at the moment he welcomed it. Looking next to him Jareth was ready. He gave the man a nod.
Kurr he just shut out. He didn't want to hear anymore the Pirate had to say at the moment. Yes he wanted his creds but maybe he failed to realize that his own life was worth more.
Jakira. He could hear her packing away her medical gear. Hear the anger she still held as to which she performed the task. There was something more as he focused and his relaxation was becoming easier to manage. He felt something. It was odd like a new sensation. He felt the anger she held for Kurr...and himself. His concentration broke and he opened his eyes.
He grimaced behind his helmet. ***I'm sorry Jakira. They don't understand what you are loosing. Even I don't fully understand the scope of it.*** He thought to himself.
He heard Kurr taking to Jakira behind him. Again he shut it out.
Shaking his head he kept looking forward. **"I wish this door would hurry up and open."** He said to no one in particular as Kurr finished talking.

As Jakira packs up her gear, a fimiliar tingling sensation tickles her skin, much like she'd get when she was around Mahchen. Confused her hand pauses in its work, nearly dropping the wad of bandages she had pulled out. The Voice however was not around, and she couldn't sense his presence like she had when she had been concentrating on their bond. Her gaze goes to Wes for a moment, as she senses the hint of pity and sadness among his determination. Resolute, Jakira goes back to her task, taking her place far away from Kurr at the back wall, attempting to ingore him. Or at least until he comes right up to her holding out his hand in a truce.
The lithe Zeltron at first just stares at the hand the Feeorin captain offers her. "**I can agree that this is neither the time nor place for an argument and our survival requires us to work together. Frankly I don't like you,**" she says pausing to let it sink in before adding, "**And your ship is the last place I wish to go.**" Turning away to face the front of the lift, she ignores his proffered hand. "**Call me 'toots' again and you'll see just by how much. And as Wes said, I'm *not* his girlfriend**"
"I wish this door would hurry up and open." Wes said to no one in particular and Jakira nodded her agreement. While she knew all hell would probably break loose once it did, she was eager to leave. To find Mahchen and the others and find some relative safety, eager for this wonderous turned hell night to be over.

As if hearing the Mandalorian's wish, the elevator car completes its journey, landing with a soft bump that causes a few twinges of pain and winces as the wounded are jostled. The burnished-gold doors slide open with a soft ding, and those inside are treated to a view of the Hospital's main hallway, although it has been radically changed from when they first encountered it on the previous day.
[attachment=0]<!-- ia0 -->hospital-level1.PNG<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment]
The once pristine hallway is clouded in a haze of dust, and blaster marks and furious gouges mar the once pristine brickwork. Broken bits of plaster and rubble lay all around, obstructing some of the view, and the faint sounds of an occassional wail of pain or the report of a blaster rifle sounds from down far away halls. The dust is now beginning to settle, but it is disturbed again with the fresh explosion of a grenade outside the temple's walls, or the shifting of stone and mortar up above them.
Bodies line the dark hallway at odd intervals, some still desperately clinging to life, but most in some form of distressed unlife. A handful of stormtroopers lay among them, most killed by blaster fire but a few have spear hafts and arrow shafts broken off in them, but a grand majority of the dead and dying are tallied amongst the unfortunate Hobben.
Relatively silent, there don't appear to be any stormtroopers or Hobben in sight, leading one to think that a bulk of the fighting has either been resolved or moved to other portions of the ancient Temple. Battle-worn and their comraderie frayed near to the breaking point, our valiant heroes need only make the desperate trek to the end of the hall and into the storage bay, where the freedom and salvation of the jungle awaits...

As if on queue to his words the elevator came to a slight jostle and stopped. His leg twinged a bit but with the pain meds Jakira had given him the sensation was fleeting.
A soft ding sounded signaling the opening of the doors. Cringing inside his armor he rolled his eyes at the unfortunate timing of the sound. Already having his carbine at the ready he brought it up to his shoulder and sighted down its length as he crossed the threshold of the elevator into the recently occupied battle zone. Dialing up his audio receptors he began hearing the not so distant sounds of battle. Luckily they weren't there waiting for them. Moving further out his armored feet made slight crunching sounds upon scattered debris as he walked. Looking to the end of the hall he saw their destination. Now all they had to do was reach the hidden door.
Watching to his left a he moved to the right side of the hall. Coming to a stop where the first corner was he looked down the left hallway. Not having full line-of-sight he waited on that hall. Turning to his right he prepared himself to sweep the hallway. Peering out he looked for signs of Imperial activity as his carbine swept back and forth.

Taking a step out after Wes, Kurr slung his rifle to his hand and with a pitched whine, powered it up. Seeing the dead never bothered the feeorin ... he'd seen his share of blaster burns and blood in his time. But the thought that there still might be some stragglers is what caught his thoughts. Looking at the bodies, he made a move to one of the troopers, looting the body for anything useful: utility belt, clips, explosives, weapons ... anything that could give them an edge. Taking a few moments, the pirate also looked over the armor, with particular interest in the helmet and its communicator.

Following last, Jakira pulls with her the three women, concentrating on keeping them together and moving as the men, more experienced in these affairs, led on. She too had seen her share of death but those had been in the course of her profession. Her pace falters for a moment as she takes in the macabre sight, unprepared to see the results of the raid on her hospital. No one at the first glance to have been left alive.
*Will we meet the same fate if they overpower us?* she wonders, and the thought seems to only serve to dishearten her, the proof of what could await them evident in front of her. The sounds of the battle further on down the hallways leave her shaken. Taking a deep breath she lets it calm her in an attempt to clear her mind of the distractions of the battle, returning some of her resolve. As she passes quietly behind the others, she seeks the Hobben for any signs of life, willing to believe some may yet survive this ordeal.

### **Anazider** (2010-08-27 15:54:06)

Only the hum of Jareth and Nestil's lightsabers punctuates the gloomy silence as the party creeps forward, the sounds of battle all but having curtailed. The going is slow and dangerous, as the ground shifts beneath their feet and the terrible noise above them sounds as if the building is sundering all around them.
*******************************************************************************
Kurr comes up with 4 stormtrooper rifles still in operating condition, as well as three spare blaster packs, 2 combat knives (vibroblades that can be attached as bayonets), a grenade, and a utility belt. Many of the other weapons and implements have likely either been taken by the Hobben, other stormtroopers, or destroyed in the conflict. The Feeorin can remove the helmet easily enough, the stormtrooper's head thunking back to the stone floor with a dull, lifeless smack.
The Pirate can surmise that the helmet, and by extension it's commlink, will not function seperate from it's armor, although Kurr could likely tap into the commlink or extract it from the helmet with some time, jury-rigging, and finagling.
*******************************************************************************
Lining the first intersection of hallways are more bodies, a tendril of smoke winding its way from a doorway that Jakira can point out leads to her Surgical ward. At the next intersection it is more of the same, and the desperate group of comrades find themselves almost in sight...
**"On order of Governor Rothke and by the authority of Emperor Krayt, you are hereby arrested and sentenced to indefinite servitude in the Emperor's labor camps for crimes of rebellion and defying his majesty's will. Trooper, shackle these primitives and shoot any that dare to put up a fight."**
The decree echoes through the hall, coming from what once was the hospital's waiting room. Muffled oaths sounding in a language only Jakira and the Hobben trailing behind her know, follow on the heels of the decree, only to be silenced with sharp smacks of metal against flesh, and cries of pain. The trio of Hobben women stifle their own cries, as the sharp sounds of their fathers, son, and brothers being beaten a scant few meters away hurts them almost as if they were suffering the blows themselves.
It would take the lead members of the party only a few steps more to gather a glimpse of the situation, but that would risk attention, and with their goal so very, very close...

Wes carefully moved down the battle scarred corridor. With debris scattered about it makes even simple careful walking a bit treacherous. Despite the uncomfortable silence the sounds of battle can still be heard overhead.
As Kurr and Jakira check out troopers and Hobben alike he continued to move forward with Jareth and Nestil. Both still have their weapons lit as the color from their sabers cast an intermingled color around them.
Calm and focused he moved past the surgical ward further down the hall to the next intersection. His own battle hardened senses told him that there wasn't anyone there. Still he rounded the corner and swept the hall with his carbine. The optics in his helmet amplified the ambient light in the area. No troopers greeted him, only the bodies if dead Hobben and Imperial troopers. Though the first far outnumbered the second.
Taking two more steps towards their destination he heard a voice boom out causing him to stop. "On order of Governor Rothke and by the authority of Emperor Krayt, you are hereby arrested and sentenced to indefinite servitude in the Emperor's labor camps for crimes of rebellion and defying his majesty's will. Trooper, shackle these primitives and shoot any that dare to put up a fight." Looking in the direction of the voice Wes remembered it was the waiting room he had passed twice before. Instead of the sound of patients waiting to be seen it was the dull crack of metal hitting soft flesh. Cries of pain accompanied the sickening sound.
He looked back at Jakira. He could see the look of shock on her face from the sounds within the room. Somehow he knew in his gut that she wouldn't leave with out them. How he wasn't sure. Maybe it was just the look of determination upon her face that said it all. Without a word he nodded his head and motioned for the Hobben women to stay put.
Moving as quietly as possible he made his way to the door hoping that the sounds from inside the room would over take any he made outside.. Inside the voiceswere clearer now as his focus was inside through the doorway. He had a feeling there may have been a dozen people or more in the room. Not knowing who was who and where exactly they were Wes knew that he needed to look in. Looking back at the others to make sure they were ready. Giving a single nod he began peaking around the corner into the room.

Paying only enough attention to his surroundings to know if he had to shoot something, Kurr worked feverishly on the helmet's comlink. It was his hope that he could wire the device so that they could hear the communiques between the troopers and their commanders. Back when he was storming vessels with the others, it was a trick they used to ambush the security forces on ships and take them down before they became too much of a problem. The feeorin knew he didn't have much time ... Wes and Nestil had that look on their faces, and Jakira was getting ready to do something stupid, which in turn knew that the others would as well. *Fine time t' b' a hero, ya soddin' piece o' monkey-rat,* Kurr scolded himself, *Finally get a gristin' ship an' what happens? Ya get mixed in with a bunch o' gristin' fools lookin' t' be heroes.* Bemoaning over the thought, he twisted the last wires and hoped the com would work ...

Almost absently, Jakira follows along behind Wes, Jareth and Nestil, she knows almost without looking that the bodies she sees of the Hobben in the hall are beyond her help. Something else though has drawn her attention, her feet moving automatically to keep up with the others as the myriad of feelings course through her, her other senses attuning to something much farther away.
She stops when Wes does, moving beside him as her focus turns to what awaits them in the waiting room. The words of the officer within barely comprehensible as he declares his captives slaves. The Hobben's determination becomes her own, they weren't going to allow themselves to be taken and neither was she. As Wes turns his head to look at her, she meets his gaze. She didn't have to say anything to him, he knew already what her course would be. But she had a responsibility to the three Hobben women they had already rescued.
Pulling them to the side, she tells them with quiet words to stay put and to be ready to run to the hidden door when it was time. Not knowing exactly how effective she'd be in a fight, it doesn't stop her from training behind then others, keeping near the back. If nothing else she could start ushering out the Hobben captives, taking them to safety while the others dealt with the Imperials within.
With battle imminent, she attempts to tap into her newly acquired senses in the hopes of keeping them from being caught unawares.
(( Use the Force: Sense Surroundings +5, Perception +10. Jakira will stay behind the others, ready to move in to pull out the Hobben once the fighting starts. She's also attempting to keep sharp so that they don't get ambushed from behind. ))

The young man treads slowly through the dimly-lit hallway with his lightsaber at the ready. While moving forward, he stops briefly beside Wes as the mufflied cries of the fallen echo throughout the temple. Jareth then glances around the area before speaking to the Mandolorian in a whisper. **"What's the old saying? Out of the pan…"** Not taking any chances, the scout bends over for cover while blending in with the shadows. He then takes a deep breath to calm himself before reaching out with his feelings. He turns slightly to face the hobben woman he saved earlier and speaks in a hushed but comforting tone. **"Make sure to stay with the doctor.

Jakira, Jareth, and Wes all reach out with their feelings, extending their extra sensory perceptions to gain a better of idea of the situation within the waiting room.
For Jakira, the sensation is a tingling electricity that runs along her body, the energy connecting with those within the waiting room to reveal the numbers and locations within. She can now more acutely feel Litasha's pain, and judging by the sensations that the doctor feels, Jakira can tell that the Hobben has a fractured arm and perhaps a few broken ribs.
Wes's mental image in the Force is a great deal more tactical; a grid overlay of the room with its inhabitants placed like pieces on a battle map. He can feel the resolve in the Hobben in the room, and the overarching confidence of their Imperial overseers. Of the five enemies that he can sense, the Mandalorian can ascertain that their leader, the one he had heard issuing the decree moments before, is the most dangerous.
In the Jedi's mind, Jareth sees a grid, but it is more a mapping of the interconnectedness of the life energies of all the beings in the room beyond. His years of training in the Force allow him to sift through the emotions and sensations threatening to choke the room, to gain an accurate depiction of the number of occupants in the room and their positioning.
*******************************************************************************
Kurr fiddles with the helmet-mounted commlink, managing to remove it from its enclosure. But when he goes to hotwire the unit, without any manner of tool, the commlink fizzles and short circuits, several of the capacitors on the circuit board melting down and making the comm unit inoperable. **(Rolled a 1 on the mechanics check to rig the commlink)**
*******************************************************************************
Sweat drips from the Mandalorian's brow as he creeps forward, the heavy beskar'gam armor not made for such stealthy movements. He manages to plant himself to one side of the waiting room's entrance, and after listening intently for a few breathes, Wes can determine that it doesn't appear as if anyone within the waiting room is alerted to his presence.
Jareth manages to skulk to the other side of the doorway with much greater facility, his lighter armor not impeding him nearly as much as the Mandalorian's. Suddenly, as the scout moves into position, both he and Wes hear movement within the the waiting room:
**"All right you filthy nerf scrumper, up you go- "
"Wait, Sarge, you hear something?"
"There's always something to hear on this kriffin' backwater Noob! You gettin' twitchy on me?"
"Nah, nah Sarge, I swear I heard something, honest! Like some kinda humming, or something."
"Kriff me… Might be some stragglers. Jag, go with the Noob and do another sweep of the hallway."
"Blast it all, why me Sarge? Grrr…. C'mon Noob, and Emperor Krayt help you if there's nothing out there…"**
There is more rustling in the room and the sound of boots clicking on stone, and as Wes and Jareth crouch in waiting, two stormtroopers come swaggering through the doorway. As the file out of the waiting room, it is apparent that they have not yet realized that the Mandalorian and the Scout linger in the shadows to the side of the door, but it is only a matter of time.

Advancing on the door Wes comes to understand what is in the room just like he has done more times than he can count. But this time instead of thinking it was just his gut telling him what was beyond the threshold of the door he now knew that it was the Force. It was an odd feeling to finally realize how he seemed to know these things. What he always used to explain as his gut telling him who, what and where was now something that he never figured to be possible.
With the Hobben huddled in the middle of the room the Imperials stood around them in tactical positions. Getting in wasn't going to be easy or done quietly. He saw Jareth move up along side and take the opposite side of the doorway. Opening up his comm he brought up Jareth's freq. **"We better do this quick so the others cant react. It feels like 4 troopers and an officer. If possible he should be one of the first to go down."** He was about to say more when he heard movement in the room followed by voices.
Listening closely he curses as it was probably Jareth's light saber that gave them away. ***Dam. Good weapon and all but noisy.*** He thought as two troopers were advancing on them. Holding out a cautioning hand to the others that were behind him he hoped that they would get the idea.
**"Take yours, I'll take mine."** He didn't tell the Jedi that they were coming out as he could hear them just as well as he did. Raising up his carbine just a little more he waited for the two to cross the threshold. They wouldn't even know what hit them. His hope was to drop his target and then move into the room in an attempt to take out the Officer. It was then he remembered something his father once told him. ***Ad'ika, the best battle plan never survives first contact. You generally have to make it up as you go.***
As the trooper came into view his finger eased back on the trigger.

Jakira felt exposed waiting in the central hallway. Who knew where that blasted Sith woman was and here they were just sitting in the open. As Wes and Jareth approached the door to the waiting room, she motions to the three Hobben women and then taps Rehn on the arm indicating for them to follow her as she quietly and slowly heads for the door to the storage room. Once a fight started there was no telling what would happen and the women had no means to protect themselves.
Peeking into the room first she makes first its all clear before she urges them in and to the hidden door. "**Go on without me, I'm going to stay to lead everyone else down.**" She places a reassuring hand on the closest of her attendants. "**Take the tunnels out, we won't be long**," she says before turning a sharp gaze to Rehn. She was depending on him to make sure they stayed safe and the meaning was clear enough.

**"I've got a bad feeling about this …"** Kurr muttered, sliding his rifle back into his hand. A quiet whir clicked into place as his mechanical eye shifted a bit from green to red as the rifle softly hummed to life. Thinking for a moment to his stun grenades, the feeorin knew that idea was shot as Jareth and Wes made their move. Kurr tossed Jakira a grim look as he gritted his teeth and moved to a more secure location, motioning the doctor to follow him.
Once there, he squatted down and prepared for the oncoming onslaught that was sure to follow. Bracing himself against the door for cover, the pirate was ready to blast any hostile making their way out. Twisting his neck a bit, a popping-crack sound emitted from him as he narrowed his eyes and took aim.

After a moment's pause, Jareth reversed the grip he had on his lightsaber.

C'mon Noob, and Emperor Krayt help you if there's nothing out there…"** With a snort, the young man jumped out from his hiding place and landed right in front of the two unsuspecting troopers. **"If only you knew the irony.

First day on the job is always the hardest"** With a shake of his head, Jareth took a step forward and thrust his saber at the new stromtrooper with the speed and ease of a practiced soldier. He then brought the weapon up towards his body in a defensive position, ready for any opposition that came through the doorway.

As the Jedi and the Mandalorian make their surprise attacks, time seems to freeze to the second for the combatants, the Stormtroopers leaping back in agonizingly-slow detail that Wes can trace the lines of blast and weapon scarring on the armor of the trooper he assaults, while Jareth hear the sharp intake of breath from his trooper's vocalizer as that Imperial inhales what may be his last.
Wes's shot glances off of the trooper's armor, but misses doing any lasting damage, and it is all his Jedi comrade can do to raise his lightsaber and deflect the wayward blaster bolt, lest Jareth end up with a third nostril in a rather inconvenient area of his face.
**"Sonuvamotherkriffer! Sir, we've got Jedi and Mandalorians all over the place, we need backup!"**
Both stormtroopers raise their ARC-9965 blasters, training them on their attackers and preparing to unleash point-blank hell.
*******************************************************************************
Wes recovers from his misfire, raises his blaster carbine and opens a smoking, circular window in the middle of the stormtroopers helmet, the unfortunate soldier crumpling to the temple's stone floor in a boneless heap.
Just beyond the dead trooper, within the waiting room, Wes can see that some of the Hobben have begun to stir although they are quickly beat down by the lieutenant and the remaining stormtroopers. The Imperial Officer rapidly begins issuing orders the moment he spies one of his troopers flop lifelessly to the ground. **(19 to attack, 24 damage)**
**"Use the savages as shields, and blast anyone or anything that comes through that doorway! Hear that whoever you are?! I have no compunction against ending these primitive idiots and you along with them! Surrender now, and you may find mercy in Emperor Krayt's judgment!"**
Dutifully following orders, the two stormtroopers in the waiting room each snatch up a Hobben body-shield, with the Lieutenant taking Litasha for himself. The Hobben attempt to protest, but between their chains and several wicked cuffs and rifle-butts, they soon sullenly acquiesce. Litasha's groans of pain are stifled through gritted teeth, but she does not appear to be fairing well under the Imperial's rough treatment.
*******************************************************************************
Finding himself back on his heels from having to defend against the potential friendly fire, Jareth leaps forward, yellow lightsaber-blade crackling and sizzling wherever it encounters trails of dust in the air.
As the Jedi lunges, the Stormtrooper he's assailing lowers his blaster rifle just at the last moment, allow the offending laser sword to glance off his bayonet and sheering it off at the muzzle. The Stormtrooper then takes aim at Jareth, unleashing a torrent of blaster fire that the scout deftly evades and parries with his lightsaber, leaving both at a stand-off.
*******************************************************************************
Kurr gets to the doorway across from the Storage facility with little trouble, securing the access point and bracing himself for any incoming attack. From his vantage, he can cover both the waiting room entrance as well as the avenue into the Storage Bay, and aside from several massive crates, the pirate has a clear vantage straight to the back of the room.
*******************************************************************************
The Hobben attendant nods rapidly as Jakira dispenses her orders, taking her friends by the hands and leading them through the doorway into the Storage room. Rehn eyes Jakira, but proceeds as instructed anyway, although he does turn just within the doorway, a finger raised and his mouth opened in some smart-ass reply.
...A smart-ass reply that the Doctor will never hear, as a darkened form drops from above the doorway behind Rehn, and suddenly the slicer finds the point of a wickedly-serrated sword blossoming from the front of his chest. The Zeltron manages only a look of abject surprise, and an amused grunt before his eyes roll back in his head and his body goes limp on the blade impaled through his heart.
A blond head peaks from over the dead slicer's shoulder, and screams explode from the Hobben in the storage room, now cutoff from Jakira and the rest. The grin Alixana wears is borderline-demonic, and she takes a sardonic pleasure in extracting the Sith-crafted sword and throwing Rehn's corpse aside, a scarlet mist following the arc of the body.
**"I could sense the presence of the savages below, but could not, for the love of the Emperor, find the way below… But you will show me, won't you pretty little doctor?"**
The Sith assassin trails a finger through the fresh blood coating her warsword, the crimson-coated finger trailing up to her lips to be tasted in a morbid seduction. Jakira can sense a malevolent hunger coming from the Sith Agent's sword, a hunger that only grew more violent with Rehn's death. The presence of the warblade combined with the overwhelming feelings of rage and power coming from the assassin are enough to make the Zeltron grind her teeth.
**"Governor Rothke wonders how you sound when you moan… I wonder how you sound when you *scream*… Please resist, pretty little doctor, I want to satisfy a curiosity!"**
Alixana stalks towards Jakira, her hips swaying hypnotically like a coiled viper preparing to strike. Just beyond them, the Hobben women have ceased their screaming and judging by the looks on their faces, they are preparing a somewhat ill-advised decision to come to the doctor's rescue. Nestil shouts an oath in the name of the True Emperor before she charges across the intervening space, her silver-lightsaber blade hissing and her tattered cape streaming behind her.

Wes watched as his blaster bolt left the carbine. Time seemed to slow as it began to travel the short distance to the trooper who somehow managed to move a fraction of an inch. That slight movement meant a glancing blow instead of the kill shot he was hoping for. Unfortunately his shot only grazed the trooper and kept on forcing Jareth to abandon his ambush and defend himself.
Cursing inside his helmet as the trooper began calling for backup and raising their weapons Wes knew that shared blaster fire at this range was going to be bad for both parties. Adjusting his aim ever so slightly he pulled the trigger again. There was no saving the trooper this time as he found his mark. The trooper crumpled to the floor a smoking mess no longer able to terrify the innocents of the galaxy.
Chaos had then erupted around him. Next to him the trooper Jareth attacked was still up ready for a fight. Behind him screams of the Hobben women found their way to him as something terrible was causing them to break their silence. It was only his training that kept him form turning his head to see what was going on with the others.
At almost the same time he heard the voice of the Imperial Lieutenant issue his orders and the voice of the woman Sith from behind him. Now they faced a two front battle and the situation went from bad to dire in a blink of an eye. Hearing the Sith's voice and her comments to Jakira gave him pause as he didn't want to see any harm come to the beautiful doctor he had only just met. Yet he and Jareth were in no position to help because of their current action freeing the hostages. Besides Jakira wasn't the only one in danger. **"Karking hell!"** He swore over his comm. **"We need to end this quick."** He said breaking his training and risking a glance behind him only to see Nestil charging, her lightsaber held high in the air. ***Good hopefully the four of them can hold her off till Jareth and I are done here.***
Tearing his gaze from Jakira he sought focus. It unsettled him as he was finding that it wasn't coming to him as easily as before. It was only when he shut out his feelings that it finally came to him.
He peered around the corner to see the trooper (number 3) already had a Hobben and and was using her as a shield. ***These Imperials have no honor. They will deserve what their about to get.*** He thought as his own anger for their actions crept up.
Raising his weapon back up the few inches to his shoulder he stepped out slightly from the cover. Doing so he was hoping that Jareth was able to take down the other trooper beside him as he was leaving himself partially open to him. Aiming down his barrel at the trooper holding the hostage he needed to be steady as the slightest movement could cost the Hobben her life. Before firing he yelled into the room. **"Perhaps you should be hoping for my mercy Imperial. For if I find any of the Hobben in this room dead. You will quickly follow their fate."** He said with a certain air of finality as he held his breath he pulled the trigger.
OOC:
Two swift to aim on Trooper #3 eliminating his cover
Standard to attack. Ranged: Blaster carbine +9 (3d8+7) PB Shot and Aim added in
Will spend a FP if needed to ensure a hit on the trooper or at least miss the Hobben (if that can be done)

Jakira rears back as the assassin moves toward her, abject horror at what had just happened playing across her face as she tries to flee from the woman toward Nestil's protection. *She killed him… just like that.* It had all happened so quickly, much to quickly. *How long had she been waiting for us?* she wonders quickly dismissing the thought as the hunger from the sword begins to distract her thoughts. The doctor's gaze transfers from the dangerous woman to the sword she wields and then back again.
Her gaze momentarily goes to the Hobben women in the storage room, they were so close to getting out. If she could distract the Sith long enough, draw her away, they may make it out yet. Not if they got themselves killed first as was likely if they continued on their present, foolish course to interfere. "**Stay back**," she starts to the Hobben. "**Even if I tell you, you'd just kill me anyways. There's nothing in it for me,**" Jakira says, continuing to move backwards in an attempt to keep out of the assassins reach, as useless as that was going to be. Still she tries to stay light on her feet, the better to dodge out of the way of the sword or any attempt to grab her.

Just as the scout is about to strike, a string of friendly fire suddenly launches towards his body. He jumps back and lands in an awkward position on his heels. Drops of sweat cover Jareth's forehead as he gives Wes a sideways glance. **"Not me, hit the other guy!"**
Jareth then thrust his lightsaber towards the stormtrooper next to him, but not before he manages to bring his bayonet up at the last moment to thrawt the Jedi's strike. Suddenly the trooper grins as he unleashes a hail of fire death on Jareth. Trusting in his senses, Jareth quickly shifts his weight on his back leg and barely manages to parry the trooper's flurry.
**"Alright then, guess you didn't like being called 'new troop' eh?"**
Jareth then redirects his efforts as he brings his lightsaber up above his head. The jedi then arcs his weapon down upon the head of the stormtrooper in a vicious strike; putting all his weight behind his blow. **"I hear ya, Wes. I wanna put an end to that blonde hutt's laughter. Sounds like a two ewoks crooning on a bad karaoke night."**

Kurr was on good terms with death. As a pirate, he'd dealt out enough of it and, during his accident, there was plenty of blood flowing. But this ... what'd happened to Rehn ... was different for him. Sure, the little guy got on the feeorin's nerves, but in his own strange sense of honor, he'd been part of the pirate's crew. And no one ... no one ... messed with a member of Captain Kurr's crew. Gritting his teeth together as his mechanical eye whirred and clicked into place on the Sith Assassin, he hefted his axe into his hands and, casting his very soul into fate's hands, swung the axe high as he leapt into the air and bore down on the assassin with the weapons deadly blade.

As Wes rounds the corner, time once again slows for him, and his senses heighten to a state he has never experienced before. The Mandalorian can almost see every mote of dust as it falls from the ceiling above, and the feelings of fear and desperate hope from the Hobben, and the haughty, arrogant rage from the Imperials swirls around him in a tidal pool with Wes as its eye.
A brief flash of light gleams off of the glossy eye-covering of one of the Stormtroopers in the room as the Imperial struggles with his Hobben captive, and in that fleeting moment Wes raises his carbine, draws a bead and fires, leaving a smoking void where a black plastoid lens had been just moments before. **(22 to attack, 20 damage)**
**"I want that Mandalorian dead, you hear me?! Dead!!"**
The Lieutenant screeches at the top of his lungs as he turns his officer's sidearm on Wes, unleashing a torrent of blaster fire that fills the doorway, but only finds purchase on the opposing wall. A deep sense of foreboding grips the Mandalorian and as he turns to catch a glimpse of the other stormtrooper in the room, Wes stares down a bolt of red-hot death as blaster shot speeds its way directly towards his heart.
With the inner warning, Wes improbably manages to throw himself backwards, the blaster bolt punching a neat little hole through his armor under his armpit. The Mandalorian can feel the intense heat from the crimson lance as it scorches the beginnings of a nice blister along his side, but as he lands back behind the cover of the wall, he finds himself sore but with no lasting injury. **(1 Destiny Point consumed)**
*******************************************************************************
Jareth weaves his lightsaber blade in front of the stormtrooper, who without preamble or attempt at style, clicks the selector on his blaster rifle to a fully-automatic mode and prepares to let loose a barrage of fire on the Jedi. But just as he does, Wes runs past him into the room, and as the stormtrooper's attention is divided, Jareth leaps into action.
Bringing his saber blade down, the stormtrooper returns his attention to Jareth just long enough to bring his blaster rifle up in defense. This does not deter the lightsaber, as the scout slices the rifle in half, arcing blue sparks running up the two-halves into the arms of the ill-fated stormtrooper. Jareth then brings the yellow blade across in a furious swipe at the stormtroopers midsection, the smell of burned blood and melted plastic assailing the air.
The stormtrooper stands in an awkward pose for a long second, holding the two halves of his sundered blaster rifle, before his torso topples forward and his legs fall backwards into the waiting room. **(17 to attack, 20 damage)**
*******************************************************************************
**"Aww… Why so glum Feeorin, did I just murder your boyfriend? Worry not, you will be joining him very, very soon…"**
Alixana strides towards the Pirate, the assassin all sadistic smiles and alluring slink in opposition to Kurr's thunderous charge. As the Feeorin raises his Vibro-axe high, the Sith moves with an incredible speed, meeting Kurr's axe with her own blade and forcing it aside in a shower of sparks. With Kurr overbalanced and the head of his axe embedding in the stone floor, the assassin encircles the Feeorin's wrists in the crook of her sword-arm, tightens, and lifts, causing Kurr's elbows and shoulders to lock almost to the point of dislocating.
This has the side benefit of making the Pirate's hands go temporarily numb, and as a result he relinquishes his grip on his axe. As he does, the assassin places her freehand on his chest, almost tenderly, until an invisible force lifts Kurr and hurls him into the roaring Imperial Knight, who is not quite dexterous enough to dodge out of the way. **(16 pts of damage to Kurr, disarmed, and he is prone… on top of Nestil)**
The assassin watches as the Imperial Knight and the Pirate skid to an entangled halt, her empty hand straying to a shapely hip while the other flourishes her jagged blood, flinging blood everywhere. Alixana exhales a breath, blowing a blood-coated strand of blond hair out of her eyes as she watches Jakira retreat. As the Zeltron glances out of the corner of her eye, she finds the sanctuary afforded by the lightsaber-wielding Imperial suddenly obliterated in a collision with the hated Pirate.
**"Don't scurry too far pretty little doctor, you and I have a great deal more playing to do!"**
Alixana's chilling laughter echoes loudly in Jakira's ears, dogging her every step.

Jakira's hopes had risen when Kurr and Nestil charged her assailant, the murderer of Rehn, but they were quickly smashed as they were sent colliding into each other. She chokes back a call of help, who would she call for? Wes and Jareth had their own problems to contend with. Besides the woman wanted Wes too, not just what was moving to safety. The longer the young Zeltron doctor could hold out, the more time they would have to get away. Continuing her retreat backwards, she finds her options are limited. Run deeper into the hospital, hoping to lose the woman long enough to double back to the safety of her friends. Or make her way toward the waiting room, adding Alixana to the list of troubles that Wes and Jareth had to contend with until Nestil and Kurr could join the fray once more.
Her gaze goes to the Imperial Knight and the pirate; one was disarmed and the other distracted by the collision. If she ran, then it would only delay the inevitable conflict and take her away from those who could help her. Her decision made, she turned and ran. Ran into the waiting room.

Watching his shot all the way to completion Wes grinned at the trooper fell to the floor. Its helmet forever ruined as well as what was underneath it. Thankfully the Hobben that was being held by the now suddenly deceased Imperial was unhurt.
At the uncontrolled screaming of the officer Wes was shifting his angle to him. He sensed the officer was going to fire. His instinct was spot on as blaster bolts found the opposite side of the door he was at. A smile began to form as he began to raise make his move on the officer but movement from the other trooper caught his attention as a single lance of red energy sped for him. With a tingle of warning and dire urgency he quickly backpedaled as the bolt passed to close for comfort leaving what would be another new scar beneath his arm.
With only two left in the room the odds were better now for those outside wanting in as well as the hostages wanting out. He yelled into the room almost willing for the hostages to rise up and fight. **"Now is the time to fightback against the Imperials. You have them outnumbered and they'll fall before you."** He didn't even know if any of the Hobben would even understand him but it was worth a shot.
At the sound of the lightsaber beside him. He looked to his side and saw the work that Jareth made of the trooper has he fell to the floor in pieces.
**"Nice. Two left inside. I can hit the last trooper but not the officer, can you do anything to him?"** He said over his comm to Jareth. From the others position he figured that Jareth might have line-of-sight on the officer.
He readied himself again. The remaining trooper came to close to getting a solid hit on him despite the cover that the door provided. Repeating what he did last time he took a breath and found the calmness that often came to him during battle. Stepping out to take aim on the last trooper in the room he pulled the trigger and watched to see if his aim was true. As he did so a feeling of fear washed over him. What was surprising was that it wasn't coming from the overconfident Imperials in the room or the already scared Hobben that they held prisoner. It was coming from Jakira and she was getting closer, quickly. Something was wrong. It seemed to be the theme of the night

Letting out a half-cough/half-laugh, the feeorin grinned at the Sith Assassin. **"Ah, a girl after m' own heart. Finally, sumone who knows how t' get this ole pirate's attention,"** Kurr said, quickly sliding his rifle around and unloading on her. **"Dun go anywhere yet, sweets, Ole Kurr ain't dun with ya yet, eh?"** Using his current position, he braced himself in an attempt to shield Nestil. Deep down, he knew his only chance was to get the Imperial Knight up on her feet and possible distract this Sith kiffer long enough for him to do some real damage. **"C'mon, sweetcheeks, this ain't na time t' b' sleepin' on th' job, eh?

As the trooper in front of him holds his blaster up in defense, Jareth pivots and launches a brutal side swipe at the man. The trooper gasps, as his body goes rigid in a frozen position before toppling towards the ground. Jareth then pauses and takes a deep breath as an invisible backlash of his aggresive actions assault the Jedi's concious; The saber in his right hand being too much of a burden to bear. He quickly comes to his senses though, as the shouting of the Lieutenant and laughter of the Sith Assassin echo throughout the hallway. Wes suddenly chimes in, his comm link going off with a lot of noise and shouting.
**"Nice. Two left inside. I can hit the last trooper but not the officer, can you do anything to him?"** 
Jareth then inverts his lightsaber to a defensive stance and taps into the surrounding life around him while concentrating on the two lifeforms that is the Lieutenant and Litasha, the secretary of the hobben hospital. **"I'm workin' on it."**
When the jedi feels that he is at an equilibrium with his self and his surroundings, he reaches out with his feelings towards the unsuspecting officer's neck and tries to crush his windpipe with an oppresive, unseen force.

Wes rounds the corner, and raises his blaster carbine to put due to the last stormtrooper in the room, but just as the Mandalorian makes himself visible, the stormtrooper raises his hostage to ward off being sniped.
The Hobben, being one of the few that can apparently understand Basic, heeds Wes's orders, and as he his dragged to his feet, the Hobben gardener throws all his body weight to the floor and kicks out, catching the stormtrooper painfully in the instep of his boot. As the stormtrooper reels from the unexpected assault, a brief flame blossoms on his chest, surrounding a small blaster hole neatly planted in the center of his chest by the Mandalorian. The unfortunate Imperial trooper has only a few, listless moments to stare down at the hall in his chest before he is stumbling backwards into the wall, where he slides lifelessly to the hospital's stone floor. **(25 to hit, 25 damage)**
*******************************************************************************
The Lieutenant watches as his last trooper is laid low, and with his face a snarling rictus of anger he pulls his commlink and switches it's frequency to all channels.
**"This is Lieutenant Anders to all Imperial personnel, my squad is down and I am under attack by Agent Nassio's targets! Requesting immediate back-up, I repeat, requesting immediate back-up!"**
As the commlink clicks out, the Lieutenant tosses the device over his shoulder in a grim gesture, not expecting to live past the next few moments. Suddenly, he kicks his Hobben shield in the back, Litasha's sharp cry of pain reverberating off of the waiting room's walls and echoing down the halls. Instead of raising his sidearm towards the entrance, he points it at the assistant's back, an insidious smirk tugging at his lips.
**"You want these animals that bad, eh? Well allow me to cull the gimpy one from the herd!"**
A blaster pistol's report rings out, and a tendril of smoke curls up from the Hobben's back as time once again freezes almost to the second, each painful moment passing in slow motion as Litasha's body flounders to the ground, her life's essence draining away in a flash.
Jakira rounds the corner just in time to see all of this unfold, and as she does the Lieutenant raises his blaster pistol with the same sadistic smile, intent on putting a hole through the doctor, but just as he goes to pull the trigger on the sidearm his face turns a deep shade of scarlet and multiple droplets of sweat suddenly bead on his forehead.
The Imperial drops to his knees, clawing at his collar for some unseen garrote but finding nothing. Jakira knows the tell-tale signs of asphyxiation, and as she looks to her left, she can see Jareth concentrating with his hand, an aura of creeping rage and shame warring with steely resolve coming off of the Jedi.
With concerted cries of outrage and righteous fury, the shackled Hobben move almost as one, many swarming around the Imperial and bludgeoning him with bound fists and booted heel, while the others surround Litasha to form a protective perimeter. The few that spy Jakira cry out in their native tongue, the desperation in their pleas plainly evident.
**"Doctor, please help her! She's dying!"**
*******************************************************************************
As Kurr swings his blaster rifle around and unleashes a barrage of fire on the assassin, Alixana nimbly picks her way between the bolts, her deft footsteps barely registering in the dust on the Hospital floor as she charges. With the Pirate's shooting all for naught, the Sith inverts her vile blade and stabs it down with all her force, intent on impaling Kurr and Nestil both.
With a roar of frustration and only a few seconds to spare, Nestil gathers both her feet under Kurr, one in his chest and the other in his crotch, and then heaves with all her strength, kicking the pirate off of her and away a few feet to save him from being spitted on the wicked Sith sword. The Imperial Knight then brings her lightsaber up, almost too late, to lock blades with the Assassin. Alixana bears all her weight down on the dead lock, rivulets of sweat pouring down Nestil's face as she struggles to keep the warblade and her own lightsaber away from her throat.
**"You on your back, struggling under some idiot; sound familiar, Fel's whore?! I'm going to *enjoy* dismembering you!"**
Alixana laughs maniacally in the Imperial Knight's face, flecks of spittle and grime spraying Nestil's face. Some dark, unseen force lends the assassin some unnatural strength, and it is becoming readily apparent that Nestil will not last much longer...

Gritting his teeth, Kurr spins on the ground, letting another barrage of blaster bolts spew forth from his rifle and into the Sith Assassin. Not a coherent word can be heard coming from the pirate's mouth, instead a steady stream of curses and swears bark out with such words as "Gristin'", "Meetra-Frakkin'" and "Hao o' Makka Waluun!" As the bolts erupted from the gun, the feeorin's eyes didn't move, locked on the Sith with fatal intent. Kurr had been pushed too far it seemed. He no longer cared who came near him or who didn't ... he wanted her down for good.

Wes smiles as he spies the Hobben hostage strike out at the the trooper he was targeting. Thought the strike did no damage it caused the trooper to lose his focus. The moment was short lived as again his aim was dead on. The trooper fell back against the far wall where he slumped down to the floor. Never again would the trooper have to worry about loosing his focus.
He listened as the Officer called for backup. Silently he swore. That being the last thing they needed at the moment. This small squad was easy pickings but the call would bring maybe two to three times the number they were facing now.
It was what he then heard from the Imperial that made even his stomach turn. He could feel the fear spike in the hostage that the officer held. Her scream reverberating off the walls that was all to quickly followed by the pistols report. With his senses heightened by the Force he felt the death wound on the Hobben woman.
As the horror happens inside the room Jakira arrives at the doorway only to see the events played out. The look on her face telling him what he had already felt, the woman was dying.
As he felt her life force draining away quickly he felt other stirrings within the Force. To his left he sensed Jareth who was using the Force to attack the lone Imperial. Within the young Jedi the Mandalorian easily felt the struggle the man was fighting internally. Either the Jedi would remain strong or succumb to the raging blood lust like the one he felt coming from behind him. The Sith woman Alixana was already in a rage that almost knew no equal. It reminded him of battles past where a fellow Mandalorian would enter a blood lust and kill indiscriminately till there was no one left to butcher.
What bothered him was Jakira. He felt the same struggle coming from the small doctor. He knew she wasn't ready for something like this. She wasn't a combatant and he feared the emotions that got involved during combat might be too much for her to handle. He could feel her enter the dangerous dance that Jareth was already waging.
He turned to face the Sith and he didn't like his options. He he saw Kurr and Nestil both in compromised positions. If they didn't gain their feet or have the pressure that Alixana was forcing on them taken away, they were going to be in more trouble.
Preparing to take the fight to her he pause for only a second. Like before on the battlefield, though then he didn't realize he was doing it, he reached out to the Jedi and Jakira though the Force touching both of them. His confidence and calmness flowed from him to each. He hoped it would be enough to help them fight the temptations each felt. **"Fight it. Don't succumb to it."**
As the words left his mouth he was already beginning to run. His heavy armor would have slowed him down but from the years of wearing it it had become like a second skin. Quickly picking up speed as bore down on the Sith. Dropping his shoulder just before he reached her his battle cry resounded through the halls. Now committed to a melee he was now going to have to rely on his armor along with his martial training to deal with the dangerously armed Sith and her wicked blade.

Move action to move half way to Alixana (2 diag squares)
Standard action for charging attack. Melee: Unarmed +8 (1d6+4) +2 for the charge added in. -2 to reflex defense. Spending a FP if needed. Really need a hit here.

The Zeltron woman leans against the door jam of the waiting room, her knees threatening to buckle as the torrent of emotions course through her almost to the point of overwhelming her. Near her, she could sense the inner turmoil in the man she had come to trust as a friend, but her focus was quickly drawn to the Hobben woman, her assistant and friend. Her life was ebbing away with each beat of her heart, which was becoming few as the woman's pulse slowed. Jakira knew she was running out of time and there was a slim chance she could save her with the knowledge she possessed. Wes's words as he moves away to engage the Sith agent barely register in her thoughts as she steps into the room.
Taking one step and then another, she moves into the waiting room no longer aware of the danger around her. The cold, seductive whispers echo through her, the promise of saving her friend and protecting them becoming an irresitable prospect. She didn't know the specifics in how it would save Litashi, only that it could and would only if the Zeltron gave herself over to its cold embrace. The whispers seem to grow louder as she stepped closer to the dying Hobben, drawn forward by the pleas of the Hobben around her, begging the Zeltron to save Litasha.
Urged on by the whispers like a fly to honey, she knelt beside the young woman taking her into her arms. Suddenly she felt trapped by the tremoltous emotions and the cold promises, and finally the words Wes had uttered before he had left come to the forefront. *Fight it.* His words echo in her mind as she clutches at the injured woman. *Easier said then done.* But there was a ray of light within the cold promises, something familiar in its warmth and carried its own slim promise. Ducking her head into the Hobben woman's shoulder, she fights to hold onto the hope, slowling being filled by the warmth it offers her and forces it out to encompass the woman in her arms.

Jareth stood still as stone while the doctor rushed to the side of her assistant. A cold fury tried to fight through his inner calm, but his training finally won out in the end. Hearing the the pirate's muffled curses and the Sith's laughter, the jedi prepared himself for the confrontation at hand. Suddenly, a large form shot out beside him. He barely had time to warn the Mandolorian before Wes rushed the Sith assassin.
**"Careful! That ain't any old weapon she has. It's feeding off her hate and making her stronger in the force!"** While muttering to himself, Jareth shifted his weight and brought his weapon out in front of him in an offensive stance. Concentrating on the Sith assasain, he tried to manipulate her by taping into the life force surrounding everyone. Once he felt the connection, Jareth violently motioned away from Alixana as if to thrust the Sith away from his companions.

Alixana turns her head away from her desperate struggle against Nestil, as the heavy thudding of a charging, armor-clad warrior draws her attention. The assassin manages to lift her chin just in time for a metal-bound fist to collide with it, knocking her back a step and buying the Imperial Knight the respite she needs. **(1 Force Point used, 8 pts to Alixana)**
A hand strays to the assassin's face, where a fist-sized bruise and a bleeding, split lip mars her beautiful face. Slowly, Alixana turns back to smile wickedly at the Mandalorian, her mouth a mass of blood which and the irises of her eyes alight with a fell, crimson light. She then launches herself at the warrior, her serrated blade slashing, chopping, and stabbing at barely perceivable speeds, and it is all Wes can do to deflect the offending Sith-weapon with the armor on his forearms, sending a shower of sparks into the air at each parry.
Wes begins to time and gauge the assassin's erratic movements, and at a critical moment in their melee the Mandalorian reaches out with both hands, seeking to wrap Alixana in violent embrace. But just as Wes's hands almost reach the Sith, she plants her free hand on his outstretched wrist and uses it to vault herself over the ancient warrior as if he were a piece of low-grav gymnastics equipment, landing deftly behind the Mandalorian.
The vile sword lashes out in a criss-crossing pattern, finding weak points in Wes's armor and biting into the flesh beneath. The serrated blade tears purposefully, leaving ragged wounds in its wake, but of greater concern to the Mandalorian is the unnatural cold that tinges the wounds, like frigid water being poured through the cuts. **(25 damage to Wes)**
As Wes spins to defend himself, a furious rage builds in him, simultaneously soothing his injuries while inflaming them. The Mandalorian knows that this anger is not of himself, but that does little to appease the feelings warring inside of him, and Wes finds that he can barely keep himself from attempting to rip the Assassin's throat out with his bare hands. **(Under the effects of Sith Poison)**
*******************************************************************************
Jareth taps into the Force, drawing from the ambient life force surrounding him. As he does, he feels the dark rage in Wes fighting to break free, but the tumult of the battle doesn't hamper the Jedi's trained efforts in the slightest. Suddenly, Alixana's head snaps to Jareth to stare him down with her crimson-eyed gaze, but it is too late as the Sith goes catapulting through the air to land like an enraged Nexu near the elevator. **(13 pts of damage to Alixana)**
Nestil leaps to her feet and charges after Alixana again, although this times the tables are turned as the Imperial Knight forces the blade-lock, forcing all of her weight down on the kneeling assassin in an attempt to end the blond's life.
*******************************************************************************
The fight between Alixana and Nestil provides Kurr with the perfect opportunity to line up his shot. From his prone position, the pirate captures the assassin in the targeting reticule of his sport rifle, and when Nestil's footwork shifts to draw her away from Alixana, Kurr squeezes the trigger.
Time slows once more as the blaster bolt sails across the open space towards its intended target, Kurr's expert shooting sending the plasma lance just through Nestil's already-tattered cloak to scorch a sizzling furrow along the assassin's hip. This causes Alixana to buckle, and as the Imperial Knight's silver-bladed lightsaber descends, the Assassin turns her faltering backslide into a roll, throwing Nestil over her while also leaping to her feet. **(1 Destiny Point Used, 20 pts of damage to Alixana)**
Alixana lets loose a scream of rage and pain that is almost palpable, the Dark Side coming off of her in waves so strong the stone walls of the hallway begin to vibrate from the power.
**"I WILL NOT BE DENIED! I WILL NOT BE DEFEATED! I. AM. SITH!"**
*******************************************************************************
The world comes to life in a way that Jakira has never experienced before, the Zeltron coming into tune with the life essence of every being in the Hospital and its surrounding area. Each spirit appears as a vibrant point of light in the doctor's view, and she can see the interplay of their emotions and struggles, and how it all entwines with the living Force.
As she gazes down on Litasha, Jakira can now visibly see the Hobben's life force flowing out with every beat of her assistant's heart, and when the doctor clutches the other woman it as if like Jakira dips her hands into a warm stream. Using the deftness of her hands, and a care born from years of wielding a scalpel under extreme pressures, Jakira *diverts* the flow of the stream, pooling it back in on the Hobben to heal her, rather than allowing it to continue to contribute to the vast ocean that is the Living Force around them.
Suddenly, there is a sudden intake of air as Litasha gasps in deep gulps of breath, as if she were breathing for the very first time. The Hobben's vision returns slowly, although it still threatens to fail at the edges, but as she looks down she finds Jakira half-collapsed over her, the doctor also struggling to regain her senses, while the rest of the Hobben crowd around the pair protectively.
**"It is a miracle!!"
"Did you see that?! She pulled her back from the gates of the dead, just like a *Ghul'sharess*!!"
"By the Ali'la, thank you doctor!! Thank you!!"**

The warmth floods through and around them as she diverts the current back into her Hobben friend, encompassing them in a sense of wellbeing. As Litasha takes the gasp of the air of new life, Jakira begins to sense the events around her. She could almost feel the sting of the blade as it slices past Wes's armor into his skin, leaving it's poison in his system and then the resulting rage as it takes hold.
Brought back to herself by the Hobben she hears them speak around her, praising her. *Angel of Mercy*. The translation pops into her head from one of the stories Mahchen had taught her when she was first learning the Hobben's customs. They thought of her as some angel, but as she knelt there, slumped over her Hobben assistant, she felt wretchedly tired. She could see the world now as she never thought possible. Yet, she feels as if she'd had a sense of it before, but until now had never been able to understand it. As she looks up and around at the gathered Hobben, things appear differently to her now. Something inside of her had awoken.
Jakira looks down at the revived woman, Litasha's head resting in her lap as they both try to regain their senses. "**Everythings going to be fine now,**" the doctor says bravely. "**We're going to get out of here.**" Her vision was clearing slowly, almost too slowly, but the yells of the assasin in the hallway causes her heart to pound faster. They weren't out of this yet. A part of her begins to shake as the waves of cold coming from the Sith beyond reverberate through her, but she wasn't about to let it stop her.
Reaching up, she asks the other Hobben for help, but nearly doubles over again as a dull aching pain strikes her starting at the wound in her shoulder to her very marrow. Not even the deep breaths she takes seems to help, but finally, after what seems like forver, she pushes past it. "**Be ready**," she starts, nearly breathless. "**When our chance comes, head to the passage. Don't wait for me**."
(( Move to stand, move to head to the door. Not going any farther than the door into the hallway till I know whether or not it's clear for the others to proceed safely. ))

The Mandalorian's eyes go wide as he feels the twin touch of the Sith blade across his back as it found a way past his armor. Getting hurt in combat was nothing new to him. Neither was the anger that resulted in it. This though was not normal. Seemingly uncontrolled rage began simmering inside Wes as he quickly turned to face Alixana. The cuts began running hot and cold simultaneously is if his body didn't know how to react to the poison blade left behind. That in and of itself only fueled the anger on even more and once again he is reminded of Mandalorian brothers that fell into the battle rage that sometimes consumed them. The armored hand that was still holding his carbine began to tighten as if he was trying to crush the grip of the weapon.
As his breathing increased his Force senses did also despite this fact he could only feel the similar rage in the Sith as he watches Jareth Kurr and Nestil each take their turn against the Sith Assassin with varying degrees of success. If it weren't for his helmet the the almost feral grin he wore matched the anger that continued to swell in the man threatening to consume him here in the hallway. A pressure cooker that almost ready to explode and may the Force have mercy on whoever he had his sights on.
Watching her stand he almost sensed the pain she felt her rage seemed to climb to new heights as the wall seemed to shake from her power. His own fists opened and closed as he could envision his armored hands finding purchase around her slim frail neck. All he would have to do was squeeze till she stopped moving and his growing rage would give him the strength to do it easily. His own anger rolled out from him in waves through the Force to match her own. The once calm warrior was on the verge of his own blood lust
Beyond her, as Alixana began to roar her cry of raw uncontrolled rage, he saw the body of a Hobben guard that was slumped over an Imperial trooper. He could dense that they had died not long ago and thought of what the Hobben had lost here on this fantastic night that turned into a nightmare all to quickly. He thought of his encounter with Jakira only hours ago. She was like him in some ways yet completely different in others. He couldn't sense her in the other room as his own anger was preventing it. It bothered him not knowing if the rage that was building inside the compassionate doctor had won out or if his words and effort to help her had any effect. It almost seemed unlikely but she meant something to him. He was no stranger to women but he had never shared a bed with a woman quite like her.
At he thought of her his almost uncontrollable rage that was about to spill over leveled out. Now instead of his anger running free he began taking control of it shaping it to his purpose. His eyes were narrowing as they fell upon Alixana. His voice holding a deadly edge to it as he let his anger creep into his words. **"You may be Sith but you will die tonight."**
With a quick and practiced movement he was raising his carbine to his shoulder. His anger still fueled him but now it was somewhat under control. He just hoped that the infernal, cursed weapon never touched him again. Despite control he was showing he wasn't sure he'd be able to take another hit from the weapon and not go completely mad with rage. A rage that would even make Alixana pause.
OOC:
I'm guessing that Jareth knocked her away from them again.

**"I WILL NOT BE DENIED! I WILL NOT BE DEFEATED! I. AM. SITH!"**
Chaos erupted around him as the walls of the temple shook. Jareth could feel the waves of dark energy palpatating from the sith woman in such a frenzied manner that he actually felt sick. In one fluid motion, the scout brought his yellow lightsaber out in front of him in a defensive manner. While Grumbling, Jareth tapped his comm link as the battle waged on around him. **"Get a grip, Wes! You look madder than a starved hutt with no food."**
He then reached out to the force in an effort to manipulate the sith assassin once more. Suddenly his grasp of the force almost escaped the young Jedi due to the big, titanic surge of power coming from both the sith assassin and Jakira. *Sweet babies! What in the world is going on!?* Having no time to marvel at the doctor's display of the miraculous, Jareth stared at the assassin before he established a firm link with his innate abilities. Just as the Imperial jedi crossed blades with Alixana, he gestured at the sith assassin once more. Instead of flinging the sith assassin away this time, Jareth balled his outstretched hand into a fist. Beads of sweat pour off the scout as he began his battle for himself once more; The line between peace and chaos becoming blurred within his mind. *One of these days, i'm going to take the easy path, master.*

The pirate took the opportunity to stand, keeping his gun trained on the Sith. He pondered tossing a grenade into the mix, but figured it'd do more harm than good. Part of him wished he had his axe handy, as he'd like to take a piece or two off her himself. Knowing otherwise though, Kurr gritted his teeth as another barrage of blaster bolts emitted from his rifle. **"Yer gunna be a pile o' blaster-ridden bantha cheese, ya Sith-spittin' witch!"** He knew of the potential danger of firing into the crowd, but also knew that the Sith had to fall before reinforcements came.

**((Wes takes 3 points of damage the beginning of this round, from the serrated Sith Weapon))**
Wes raises his carbine, but just as he does, Jareth feels a surge in the dark aura surrounding the assassin. Blaster fire spews forth from the barrel of the Mandalorian's weapon, but Alixana moves like a blond-haired blurr as she charges down the hallway at inhuman speeds. The Mandalorian attempts to track the Sith's movements, his blaster carbine spitting death only to find purchase in shadowy after-images as Alixana somersaults, leaps, and, for a brief moment, runs along the side of a wall, to escape Wes's best efforts.
Just as Jareth summons his command over the force and raises his hand to unleash the power on the Assassin, he finds her landing just in front of his face, leering in for a seductive kiss on the lips. The kiss is filled with the coppery taste of blood, and is then promptly followed by a sharp kick to the interior of the Jedi's knee, Alixana's darkness-fueled strength causing Jareth's leg to buckle and send him into a forced kneeling position. Alixana then steps just past the scout, and inverting her blade in both hands, lashes back to stab sharply through the Jedi's armor.
The armor proves more than it's worth this day, likely saving Jareth's life, as it deflects a great deal of the offending lunge, but not all. Piercing through flesh and muscle, the Sith warsword causes a pain so tremendous it pushes the Jedi to the edge of oblivion, Jareth managing to hang onto his consciousness by the slimmest margins. A howling rage seeks to overtake the Jedi's mind, summoning the memories of his lost family and feeding from the terrible pain he has just suffered, but somehow through it all Jareth manages to stave off the darkness, maintaining control of himself. **(Natural 20 rolled, 35 damage to Jareth, -1 on the Condition Track, Sith Poison Resisted)**
*******************************************************************************
Alixana smiles her sinister, bloody smile at Wes as she begins to stalk towards the Mandalorian. The assassin lifts her blade to lick droplets of fresh blood from its cruel edge, before flicking the remainder away to splatter on Wes's ancient armor. When she stands just before Wes, Alixana raises he malefic weapon overhead and prepares to bring it down with that same bloody smile, but suddenly she freezes in place, a mixture of confusion and fury coming over her beautiful face.
The assassin goes tearing back down the hallway towards the elevator, and more specifically towards Nestil, whose face is contorted in a rictus of intense concentration and effort. Wes, Jareth, and Jakira can feel an overwhelming amount of the Force pouring through Nestil like massive conduit, and from his training Jareth knows that the Imperial Knight has all but given herself over to the flow, merging her life's essence with Living Force to grant herself tremendous power at the expense of her own being.
Now screaming in rage, Alixana turns in mid-air so that her sword is pointed at Nestil, turning the assassin into a giant, screeching missile. The Imperial Knight raises her silver-bladed lightsaber, and as the Sith comes into range, Nestil deflects the out-thrusting sword and uses her command of the Force to send Alixana sailing past to collide with the elevator's closed doors.
***Run!***
The single word is shouted into Jakira, Jareth, Kurr, and Wes's minds, and through the brief telepathic contact, the three Force Sensitives can feel the myriad of emotions running rampant through Nestil's mind, but what stands out above all the others is one singular, dauntless feeling: Duty.
Nestil raises her hands towards the sky, and as she does a powerful rumbling strikes the Hospital, threatening to rock everyone from their feet. A fissure opens in the floor behind the Imperial Knight, and choking cloud of dust coats the area from above as the stone tiles above are ripped from what little bracing that remains. Tons of debris falls into the fissure, the sudden backlash of air blowing the dust cloud full-force back at the four survivors, and it is mere seconds before Nestil and Alixana are effectively walled off from the rest of the Hospital.
The last anyone sees of the Imperial Knight before their vision is fully obscured, is her charging at the Sith Assassin with her lightsaber held high and her last battle cry on her lips.
**"FOR THE EMPEROR!"**
*******************************************************************************
Kurr is left without a target, and whatever is now transpiring on the other side of the debris wall can no longer be seen or heard. A hush has descended over the hallway, interrupted only by the slow collapse of the Hospital above, and the patter of a torrential downpour outside. The front doors of the Hospital have been blasted wide open, but the darkness of night and the rain obscures much of the few, except for more scattered Hobben and Imperial bodies.
Even still, the group knows that it is only a matter of moments before reinforcements arrive, and in their battered state, another pitched battle might be their downfall. The salvation offered by the hidden escape route awaits, and with it, the possibility of safety in the Jungle's lethal confines.
No matter what awaits, the rain continues to fall, each splattering droplet falling like a grain of sand through Fate's hourglass...

Wes was firing and correcting as each lance of red energy left his carbine. Each shot connected with the wall causing explosions of stone to erupt from where the shots impacted. Despite his anger it was amazing to him that the woman could move so fast. No matter how much he corrected his aim she either seemed to move faster or jinked out of the way just in time.
Watching helplessly as she moves past towards Jareth he can see that Alixana will get there before the Jedi can act. It all happened so fast that in the blink of an eye Jareth was down to a knee and suffering from a wicked stab from the accursed Sith sword. Turning from the Jedi Alixana began he walk towards the Mandalorian.
His eyes narrowed as his finger caressed the trigger of his weapon. With a flick of her sword droplets of intermingled blood from three people spattered against his armor. One significantly larger droplet hit him square in the helmet. It seemed to hang then for a second before it began trailing its way down his faceplate.
Standing face to face the two warriors faced off. As Alixana raised her Sith sword he readied himself to kick out at her midsection. Watching her, never taking his eyes from her face and weapon he believed he felt a strong presence in the Force. Judging form the mixed look of confusion and rage on Alixana's face she did as well. He had to admit, despite that they were trying to kill each other, the Sith was beautiful.
Without warning she was turning and off running again like before too fast to track with his weapon. Looking past Alixana to her new target he now knew who the strong presence belong to. Nestil was standing there and Wes could feel the power just emanating off the Imperial Knight. Though he didn't understand what Nestil was doing he understood that she was now the most important threat to Alixana.
The clash from the two could be felt from where she stood as well as the summoned force power that Nestil used to send Alixana crashing into the far elevator door.
*Run!* He heard in his head. The urgency as well as Nestil's sense of duty was profound in her emotions.
Wes was quick to move. Training took over as he moved in the opposite direction of the elevator towards Jakira and the Hobben that still occupied the waiting room. Behind him he felt the tremendous power that Nestil was wielding as the hospital began shaking. With a quick look behind him he saw the ceiling crumble and fall from its already weakened supports. He saw her silver lightsaber raised as she rallied with a cry for her emperor as she disappeared from the dust and debris that fell from the ceiling. If it was not for the seals on his armor he'd now be coughing from the ceilings collapse. **"Suv QaQ jetti."**
Turning back around he saw Jakira with a hand against the doorway for support. Waving his hand quickly he urged her from the waiting room. **"We need to move. The officer called for reinforcements before he went down and they will be here quickly. It would be a dishonor to let Nestil's sacrifice be in vain only to be caught."** Looking at the Hobben that were just freed he began waving them out with his free hand. **"Move! The passage way and the area is clear."** Looking at Jakira his face softened, not that she would notice due to his helmet. Though his presence in the force reflected the change in his face. Much of the anger and rage that he experienced before was now leaving him. Though the pain from the Sith poison still proved to be painful along the twin slash marks that now adorned his back.
**"Are you alright?"** He said placing his armored hand on her shoulder as he gently urged her from the doorway. He saw her friend Lying on her back in the room. By the rise and fall of her chest he could see that she was till alive. **"Your friend is alright!?"** The sound of surprise in his voice was hard to hide considering he had seen her get shot in the back only moments before.
Waiting for an answer he began waving to the straggling waiting room occupants who hadn't moved yet towards the secret entrance. All the while he kept an eye out and followed behind the last to leave.

Picking up his axe, the feeoring slung it onto his back where it'd been before hand. Taking a quick scan around, he let his rifle sling back and scooped up one of the blaster rifles from the troopers before heading towards the hatch. Still angry, Kurr looked to Wes and said, **"I'd better take point, Mate. Ye've seen bettah days … ya take th' middle with yer doc an' her friends, eh? Th' Jedi kin take th' rear fer any problems … sure th' lad kin cut them down, eh?"** Powering up the rifle, his mechanical eye whirred and clicked on the path ahead. **"Better b' safe … last thing ole Kurr needs is t' be ambushed by anuther sword-hoistin' Sith-Spawn. T' bad abut Pinkie … I'll b' sure t' spend his share o' th' loot accordinlee."**
Not giving anyone a chance to argue he stepped into the under-cavern, raising his gun at eye level and scouring the tunnel for anyone ... or anything ... that might get in their way. He hoped to see the *No Chance* again soon, because once he saw his ship, he knew they were that much closer to getting out ...

Jakira stands in the doorway watching the last moments of the Imperial Knight's life unfold as she draws on the energy she herself had just seemed to use to save her friend. Leaning heavily against the door frame there was nothing she could do to help as the woman gave herself to the flow to save them. Watching in stun silences she couldn't help but to feel relief as the wall was made between them. Now on the other side of the debris wall, they were safe. Her attention turns to Wes, her mind seemed to be slow to focus. "We need to move. The officer called for reinforcements before he went down and they will be here quickly. It would be a dishonor to let Nestil's sacrifice be in vain only to be caught." Slowly she nods, and waves behind her to signal to the others to move from the waiting room toward the passage.
The last to move from the waiting room, she's urged by Wes's gentle and concerned touch, but her legs are slow to respond. She finds herself having to lean on Wes at first, her strength having not completely returned. "**Things could be better,**" she says tiredly, her gaze turning to Litasha being carried as carefully as possible by one of the Hobben; there just wasn't time to retrieve a stretcher. "**She's in a coma, but for now she's stable.**" For now she would leave it unspoken whether Litasha would survive their trek through the jungle. Maybe they could make a stretcher once they reached its safety.
Moving slowly, almost too slowly, she looks up at Wes. He had taken a major wound from the agent's attack, she had felt his rage from the resulting poison, but there seemed to be no external sign of either, his warrior training kicking in to keep him moving. "**Are you going to be ok?**" she asks him, almost the same question he had posed to her. "**We might be safe enough once we reach the archive that I can treat your wound.**" Her feet crossed the threshold to the storage room and she tried not to stare at the corpse of the Zeltron man who had lost his life. The entrance was just ahead and she would focus on it. Already, it seemed Kurr and the other Hobben had begun making their way down.

The Mandalorian let Jakira take his arm as she slowly and weakly left the doorway as the last of the Hobben left the waiting room. He nodded at her response as he silently agreed. ***Yeah things could be better.*** He thought as she continued speaking. "She's in a coma, but for now she's stable."
He wanted to ask her how the woman was still alive. He watched as the Imperial shot her square in the back. She should have been dead almost instantly. the fact that she was still alive spoke to Jakira's medical expertize.
Keeping a painfully slow pace with Jakira he kept alert for any trouble. The fact that she was moving so slow made him think that maybe she had been hurt somehow. He was about to inquire what was wrong but she beat him to the punch. "Are you going to be ok?"
Giving her a nod he looked at her. "We might be safe enough once we reach the archive that I can treat your wound." He could see the concern in her eyes but it may have been the same concern that was there for any patient who was hurt.
**"Thanks, that would be welcomed. The poison from Alixana's weapon still burns on my back. Though maybe it should wait till we're out and into the jungle. While the secret passage may offer us some respite from their immediate search. It wont be long till they find the archive."** He looked ahead to her friend that was still being carried. **"Besides there are others that are hurt far worse than I. Jareth for one, he took a terrible hit from her."** He looked around for the hallway for the Jedi. **"I'm glad your here Jakira. We're going to need you."** He said as he helped her cross the threshold into the storage room.
His gaze followed hers to Rehn. The Zeltron lay upon the floor in a bloody mess. A feeling of sadness and frustration fell over him that was radiated out through the Force. Rehn was dead. He was feeling that what happened here this night was because of him. If the Sith and Imperials hadn't wanted him they never would have been led here. His grip on his weapon tightened as the feelings of sadness and frustration turned into resolve as he helped Jakira walk past Rehn to the secret entrance.
**"Lets hope there are no more surprises."**
OOC: Now that we're out of combat I'll have Wes take second wind(I think that is what it is) to gain some hp back.

"I'm glad your here, Jakira. We're going to need you," Wes says, and the Zeltron doctor can't help but give him a small, tired smile. She didn't know exactly what she had the strength for at this point. So much had happened so quickly that all she wanted to do was find some place reasonably comfortable and sleep, though the stinging pain in her shoulder and chest probably wouldn't abate till it was taken care of properly. Looking at the wounded Hobben and her companions she realized rest probably wouldn't be coming as quickly as she would wish. Pausing in the doorway for a moment she too turns to look back at her human friend following behind in the hallway. Now that she was taking a good look at him she could see the nasty wound the Sith assassin's serrated blade had given him. "**There should at least be time enough to stop any bleeding.**"
Jakira's words are cut short as she visibly winces and her grip tightens on the Mandalorian's arm to steady herself at the severity of Wes's frustration, sadness and following guilt. Her own senses are still open from her contact with the Force and it isn't like he was shielding them. The influx leaves her feeling a bit less steady as she is forced to deal with them as well. With Rehn the focus of his attention, her gaze inevitably returns to his compatriot. "**I'm sorry, Wes.**" The statement seeming inadequate to assuage the Mandalorian.
Her gaze finally leaves the body of Wes's fallen comrade to the crates in the storage room, realizing there was a great deal of supplies which they might find useful during their flight. Before the last batch of Hobben can make their way into the tunnel she calls to them in the native tongue to get their attention. "**Spread out and grab anything useful you can carry**," she adds, and steps away from Wes to help, her steps faltering momentarily. Waving off Wes's concern she makes it determinably to the crates, looking at labels or pulling off lids. She knows they didn't have long, maybe just a minute or two to look, but just a few supplies could make all the difference to their survival in the jungle.
"Lets hope there are no more surprises," Wes says from behind her and she turns to look at him sharply. "**You realize you just jinxed us, right?**" the question came out sternly but with some attempt at humor to lighten their dreary mood.

Ahead of everyone else, Kurr stopped and looked back at the others, his mechanical eye glowing a deep red. **"This ain't happy chatter time, eh?"** He said in a low, gruff voice. **"Yer makin' it damn hard fer th' buncha us t' be sneaky with all o' yer chatterin'. If yer expectin' us t' survive this lil' jungle trip, as well as navigatin' around a Sith-filled buildin', then we need t' gristin' focus, eh?"** The feeorin knew everyone grieved in their own way, and that supporting one another was probably a natural reaction for regular folks. But, when you've seen death like he had in the past, when you stared it in the eyes and gnawed on it's skull, you knew there was a time and place for such feelings. And being three steps away from a Sith encampment coming down on you wasn't it.
Instead, his thoughts were on his ship and getting off this rock. *Knew it was a bad idea,* he thought as he kept a watchful eye out for any danger. *Better b' sum creds in it er I swear th' ship's load will b' a lot lighter. We woulda been better off goin' t' sum dive o' a planet and jus' havin' the Hammerhead wire for th' gristin' creds.*

He felt her grip on his arm tighten as his emotions got the better of him for a moment. He noticed her gaze following his to Rehn. A short second later he heard he soft voice. "I'm sorry, Wes." He looked at her with his head half cocked to the side as he was putting two and two together. ***Did she just pick up on what I was feeling?*** He thought as he attempted to pull his emotions in somewhat. Not knowing exactly what he was doing the attempt was only partially successful. Normally he relied on his armor hiding what emotions that may appear on his face.
Wrapped up in his thoughts he only half heard her talk in the Hobben dialect as he felt Jakira take leave of his arm. With his attention back he noticed her faltering steps. He began to reach out but stopped when she recovered and waved him off. He gave a quick look to what was here. At his quip about no more surprises he spots the young doctor turn and level a look at him. "You realize you just jinxed us, right?" Her tone was stern but there was a slight smile behind the words.
His response was a soft half chuckle accompanied with a slight nod back at her before he looked back out the door for Jareth. Behind at at the passage way door he heard Kurr. From the tone of the pirates voice and the words that followed he wasn't happy with the talking. He kept the irritation from his voice as he responded in a low tone. **You're right and your own addition to the conversation isn't helping. As soon as we're into the passage we'll have some breathing room. Perhaps as we make our way to your ship you should focus on how the Sith tracked your ship here. They found us way to quickly and easily."** Kurr was right they need to be moving and the sooner the better.
He moved away from the door, towards Jakira who was searching the crates, his steps sure footed and with purpose as came up beside Jakira. His voice was low. **"I know you want to grab what you can but we need to be moving when Jareth gets here. We shouldn't wait any longer. To do so risks another fight that we're not ready for and discovery of the passage."** The urgency in his voice was there as he did his best to keep the emotion under control and held close.

Up heaving the lid to one crate and then another, Jakira quickly advances through a couple crates filled with large, unnecessary equipment for their excursion into the jungle. She does, however, manage to locate a couple medpacs and pulls them out. It's when her hands come across the collapsible frame of a stretcher that she lets out a small sound of glee at her discovery. Yanking it out she motions over one of the Hobben, "**Take Nitasha into the archive and put her on this.**"
Eager to see what else she can find she gets back to looking through the crates with the others until the last moment when Wes and Jareth force her to move on. "**It's not that I want to save what I can, but anything we can take with us may be of some use to our survival,**" she says, whispering to him in return, wasting a precious moment to look up into his faceplate. She could hear the concern and urgency in his tone as well as sense it from him even though he now tried to keep his emotions in check. "**I know we're running out of time,**" she adds, getting back to work on upturning the lids of various crates as quietly as she could manage.

"It's not that I want to save what I can, but anything we can take with us may be of some use to our survival." She whispered to him. With a quick turn of her head she looked up at him as his tall frame towered over her. He could see in her eyes that she understood. "I know we're running out of time." Despite her acknowledgment she quickly continued working on the crate she had her hands on. It opened up with a creak that made him wince inside his armor.
He looked up to Kurr only to see that the Pirate was still there with the same look on his face as before his brief triad about talking.
He gave the Feeroin a nod as he placed a hand on her shoulder as she opened another crate. He wanted to tell her to continue looking. Take all that she could salvage from here but it wasn't prudent. He knew this might be the last time she laid eyes on this hospital. One that she funded and worked hard to have it built as she saw fit. Seeing something for a last time wasn't a feeling that he was unfamiliar with. His tone lowered and softened. **"Jakira, time has run out. We need to be as far away from this room and into the passage as possible when the reinforcements storm this place. Otherwise everything we have fought for and already lost tonight will be for naught."**
He wanted to tell her that he already felt that what happened here tonight was his fault even though he knew there was no way he could have prevented it. Alixana was here looking for him and traced the *No Chance.* here. But this wasn't the time to be spilling his feelings out only to loose sight of the current objective, getting out of the hospital to the jungle. With a sigh he tried to pull his feelings in again. **"Too many have already died or sacrificed themselves tonight. I don't want to add to that number."**

Wes's gauntleted hand felt heavy on her shoulder as he urges her to stop her search and step away. With a sigh she does as he bids and steps away from the crate to follow him to the entrance to the secret passage. She looks around again, wondering if there was anything she had missed she could easily take with them, her gaze falling on Rhen.
Seeming to share the same thoughts, she can sense Wes's guilt once more as he tries carefully not to let it affect him. He had one goal, to get them out into the jungle alive. Too many had indeed died this day. Too many people she had known, or had begun to. "**Things will turn out alright,** Wes." she says, trying to put on a brave smile through her utter weariness. Pulling herself away she sets her foot to the stairs heading down into the temple's depths.

The Hobben swiftly move at Jakira's command, securing Litasha to the stretcher with a swiftness and ease born from the Zeltron's excellent training. When the foraging in the storage room is complete, and the provisions secured, Jareth motions for the others to hangback a slight distance as the scout takes point, his ignited lightsaber blade held at the fore.
Each step down the ancient staircase is accompanied by a tumble of dust and the sounds of shifting stone above. Once everyone enters the archive, they find the place in ruins. What Oraltor, the Voice, and the other force-sensitive Hobben had not managed to take with them now lays smashed by bits of collapsed pillars and fractured stone, but there does not appear to be any further surprises laying in wait for the bedraggled survivors.
Countless times the Hobben and their harried protectors are nearly thrown to their feet from a blast above, or threatened by some falling piece of plaster and debris, but they all manage to cross the archive and into the secret passage. Just as they cross the threshold of the tunnel, Jakira, Wes, and Jareth all feel a sudden surge in the force, and in their mind's eye they each see a silver brilliance coming from just above them, although it is surrounded on all sides by a roiling darkness. Jareth's greater training allows him to know that Nestil is drawing on the force more deeply than her physical being can contain, and only after a few fleeting moments the brilliance becomes almost too much to behold just before it then explodes outwards into darkness, fracturing the mental image like light gleaming on broken glass.
Force sensitives and non-force sensitives alike halt in their progress through the tunnel as the feeling of Nestil's dying in the force echoes through everyone. Although Jareth, Jakira, and Wes still feel Alixana's palpable evil up above them, the sensation is now sputtering, and greatly diminished. It appears that pursuit from the Sith Assassin will be delayed, if only for the amount of time it takes her to recover.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The going is slow through the tunnel in the darkness, but soon the survivors emerge from the tunnel into the fragrant ambience of the Solsisian jungle. Although it is the dead of night, mottled light filters through the forest screen; the blinding search light of the Imperial troop carrier being the source. From their vantage near the tree line, Jareth, Jakira, Wes, Kurr, and their Hobben charges bear witness to a heart-wrenching sight: Those Hobben that could not escape the hospital being kicked, pushed, and dragged from its confines. Most are in chains, and those that are not are in the process of being subuded for bondage. A platoon of stormtroopers stand watch over them all, blaster rifles held at the ready, while the worn-down, fearful faces of the captured Hobben reflect darkly in in the black plasteel lenses of the stormtrooper helmets.
**"Darth Krayt appreciates your 'volunteering' for our new Solsis VII work program!"** 
The porcine chuckle that reverberates throughout the clearing can be no one other than Governor Rothke. His sinister message projects from loudspeakers attached to the troop carrier, and as he speaks the repulsorcraft turns to mercilessly shine its light in the eyes of the chained Hobben.
**"And know that when you die in the mines, you and your children, and your children's children, will have sacrificed your lives for the glory of the everlasting Sith Empire! Get this filth loaded and taken to the labor camps for processing, and before I forget- "** 
Another squeeling chuckle echoes around the chamber, causing the speakers to feedback with an ear-piercing whine.
**"Destroy the hospital! Matter of fact, I hereby issue a decree that all such structures on this world are to be flattened, as a favor to you Hobben. You won't have any further need for temples; the Sith are your new gods! And we're better than you lot deserve!"**
Rothke's laughter trails into the sky as the repulsorcraft gains altitude. A stormtrooper emerges from the Hospital's entrance, supporting the blond assassin on his shoulder. Although she appears frail and ghastly with the amount of blood and sweat soaking her clothes, she still has enough strength to savagely kick a chained Hobben in passing as the trooper dutifully carries her clear of the impending blast radius.
When the transport has gained a sufficient height, it unleashes the full fury of it's payload. Rockets rip through the stone foundation, blasting rubble in all direction, while cannon fire punches through the manor topping the ziggurat, sending the roof of the villa bursting into flame. What little internal support remained to the temple collapses completely, and the ancient structure begins to implode in on itself. As it does, the troop carrier continues to pound the temple mercilessly until nothing remains but shattered ruins and a slow-burning forest fire.
The chained Hobben are forced to watch the destruction of the temple before they are marched off to their future of servitude. Silent tears stream down the cheeks of some, and any that attempt to resist are brutally beaten until they comply. The tears of the enslaved Hobben are shared by their comrades hiding in the trees with the remaining offworlders, and when the last of their trapped fellows disappear, the Hobben turn silently to the jungle and begin their trek toward salvation.
**((And… That's the end of this portion of Chapter 2 folks. I would like one or two more posts as a reaction to this one, then I'll create a new thread for the continued adventures on Solsis VII. Thank you for your continued patience with me and, as always, good luck!))**

Kurr narrowed his eyes and grit his teeth. He'd been on both sides of this scene in the past and knew that the best thing for them would be to get off the planet. But first they had to get past the troopers and to the No Chance. Looking to the others with a stone-cold face, he said in almost a whisper, **"There ain't no time fer th' bleedin' hearts … we need t' get t' th' ship an' not look back, eh?"** Taking a look around, the Feeorin continued on. **"Even one o' those Sith-spawn catch wind o' us, we're poozin' th' narglatch. An' I dunno 'bout th' rest o' ya, but I ain't interested in workin' on one o' Darth Crepes' chain gangs, eh?"** Keeping his gun close to him, the pirate continued on into the jungle ...

Jakira had never liked the catacombs, and as the structure above her began to crumble and collapse around them she was reminded why. Being trapped by the overbearing rock was certainly not her list of favorite activities. As she sees the decimated archive, she attempts to not focus on the fact that the Hobben's collected historical artifacts was most likely now lost, but instead tried to focus on the fact that the Elders and the others taking refuge in this place had managed to escape. Her trek is paused as she witnesses the Imperial Knight's selfless sacrifice, the luminous presence as she gives herself fully to a power the Zeltron doctor didn't fully understand. A part of the doctor was deeply saddened that she had never had the opportunity to get to know the woman who had just given everything of herself for their sakes. She hoped there was someone out in the universe who would have known the Imperial Knight Nestil.
Taking a deep breath as they emerge from the dark tunnels, the reassuring smell of the jungle is defiled by the atrocities occurring on the temple grounds. Standing on the edge of the forest, Jakira is paralyzed in place, forced by her own shock into watching the scene unfold before her. Outraged there was nothing she could do to prevent what was occurring, she was only left with her silent curses as even her mouth refused to work for her. The hardest blow came when the governor's transport began to systematically bombard what was left of the temple, the hospital she had spent the last three years of her life dedicating herself to and, potentially, the rest of her life.
The part of her mind which would have registered anything else occurring around her fails to notice the impact or snide comments her companions have over the scene. It doesn't even register on her that some have already begin the process of moving into the safety of the jungle, rooted to her spot by the shock of what she had just witnessed.

Wes brought up the rear of the precession. Keeping an persistent eye out behind them for any signs of Imperial pursuit. When they were half way down he was satisfied they weren't going to be followed immediately. He picked up his pace to rejoin Jakira and the others they had managed to save on this wonderful turned hellish night.
Upon reaching the archive Wes took a liberty to look around. It was left in a shambles as everything that was of value had been spirited away. Remembering where the oubliette was he looked for it only to see that it to was missing. He breathed a sigh of relief as that meant that the Warmaster was also safely out into the jungle.
The thought of the Warmaster was set aside when he felt Nestil's presence from up above. The sudden surge he felt was like a shining star that was ready to explode. At least that was what he equated it to as Nesitl attempted to push back the darkness that was the Sith Alixana. Almost as quickly as he felt Nestil in the Force he felt the power shatter and die. The Imperial Knight had given her life so that they might have a chance to scape. He looked at Jakira and Jareth wondering if they also felt the disturbance from up above. **"Ni su'cuyi, gar kyr'adyc, ni partayli, gar darasuum, Nestil. You will be remembered."**
Upon exiting the tunnels Wes is finally able to see the devastation the Sith have wrought in the short time they've been here. Dozens of Hobben are being systematically rounded up and or beaten into submission. A feeling of powerlessness falls like a shroud over him as he watches one Hobben resist only to see him viciously assaulted with the butt of a blaster rifle. All the while the squealing voice of Governor Rothke overhead can be heard from the loud speakers as the transport begins to systematically level any and all buildings on the grounds.
Looking to Jakira he sees her rooted in place as the ghastly vision before them had captured her attention. Taking the few steps to her side he as Kurr starts in again as he did up in the hospital had Wes looking hard at the Feeroin from beneath his helmet. **"Norac be'chaaj utreekov."** Strictly from the tone in his voice Kurr could tell that Wes had had enough of his comments.
Wes moved to stand in front of Jakira attempting to break the hold that the scene had on her. Locking her in place. She wasn't like him. He had seen and been a part of war, desensitized to the horrors and images that came with it. She was getting a crash course in the subject matter.
**"Jakira."** He said to her as he looked at her. The look on her face said it all as he didn't need the Force to know what she was feeling. All she could see of him was her reflection that was cast off his helmet yet his voice was the same as she had heard the evening before. Though this time his emotions were now pulled in close. **"Jakira I'm sorry but we have to move away from the tree line. We're too exposed here. The others with Nitasha are already moving off. We need to keep up so we're not separated."** When she didn't move he tried another angle as a loud explosion boomed behind him. Turning around quickly he saw the fireball that now took its residence in a section that was once part of he hospital. **"We can't help them but we can help those we already saved. Nitasha still needs your help we all do. We've all been injured in some way or another."**
An armored hand, that beguiled gentleness was placed on her right shoulder, tried to turn her in the direction of the retreating Hobben. They knew where they were going and needed to be followed. ***Come on Jakira we need to go.*** He thought as he almost tried to will her to move.

Hearing Wes' tone, the Feeorin had had enough. Turning to the Mandalorian, Kurr's eye burned a deep red as he spoke in a quiet, but sharp manner. **"Sorry, I didn't quite hear ya, Mate. Mebbe ya'd like t' say that in a lingo that sumone understands, eh? Ya got a problem with Ole Kurr? That's fine … but tell me I'm wrong, eh? Tell me we've got time fer this.

Soon as I get t' th' ship, I'm pullin' gear an' gettin' off this rock .. with er without ya."** Having said his peace, the pirate turned back to the jungle running the systems and maneuvers he knew through his head just in case they met some opposition when they left atmo. But even with his mind elsewhere, he kept a firm eye on where he was going ... and what was going on around him.

Even with Wes standing in front of her, the empty expression shock had laid on Jakira was there as the sounds from the grounds decimation resounded behind him. As the Mandalorian's hand comes to rest of her shoulder she jolts, some recognition of what was happening around her finally coming to the forefront. She let's him turn her away from the macabre scene, and then to pull her away to follow the Hobben, shaking uncontrollably in her rage and grief; emotions the jovial Zeltron had never quite experienced in full till this day. Her steps are taken blindly, distracted by the war of emotion and thoughts raging through her. She doesn't notice where she's going but at the moment it doesn't seem to bother her.

Walking along side Jakira Wes kept a hand on her back guiding and sometimes urging her forward a bit quicker so they could keep up with the others. She simply plodded along avoiding obsticals that he pointed out to her so that she didn't slow up.
He almost snorted to himself. ***A hundred years ago the galaxy spanning war had finally finished. One would think that those kind of happenings would take a break for a while. I've gone from Vong to Sith, one bad thing to something that will probably be far worse.***
He pointed out a large root for Jakira to avoid as he looked behind him in the direction they had come. The lowlight sensors from his helmet made seeing much easier here in the thick of the jungle.
Turning back around he looked at his friend just from the way she carried herself he could see that she was still in shock. **"I'm sorry Jakira. Somehow things will turn and they will get what's coming to them. Rothke especially. I only hope I'm there to see it happen or be the cause of it.** 
He continued on in silence next to Jakira with one hand on her back gently guiding her as his other tightly gripped his carbine.
