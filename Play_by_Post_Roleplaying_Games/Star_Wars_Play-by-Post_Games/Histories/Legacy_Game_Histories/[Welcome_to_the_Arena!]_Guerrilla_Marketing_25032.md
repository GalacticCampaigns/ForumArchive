# [Welcome to the Arena!] Guerrilla Marketing

### **Magical2099** (2011-05-17 02:03:17)

Deep inside the palace of Goodo the Hutt on Killee-Kor...
---------------------
***"You think this will work cousin? It seems risky, I hate to waste an investment,"*** Hoodo says as he and Goodo watch a holo of Lee fighting Hoodo's thugs. Lee soon disarms one, and the room goes from controlled violence to total chaos as the blaster starts burning strategic holes in key limbs and organs.
***"With what you owe me, Hoodo, you should be thrilled at the opportunity to indulge me this experiment,"*** Goodo replies, the acidic anger plain in his bass rumble. Hoodo holds up both short, sausage like arms, ***"Of course cousin, of course! It is your right, and I am happy, nay, honored to provide,"*** Hoodo's sniveling tone would sicken any but a Hutt, and Goodo turns back to the holo. There, Lee has half a dozen thugs crippled and makes a break for the door, only to find his face the recipient of the flat of a vibro-axe, knocking him out cold. The various goons quickly swarm him, and begin bludgeoning and kicking him as he lies defenseless.
***"You have had his wounds treated?"*** Goodo rumbles, to which Hoodo nods vigorously, ***"Then bring him before us."***
Lee finds himself woken roughly, his arms sore and numb from being bound behind him at the wrist and elbow for the past several days. A Gammorean unceremoniously hoists him over a shoulder when he moves too slowly, and he soon is thrown to the floor before two massive Hutts. Hoodo he recognizes as his new 'owner' and the second, larger and deeper green Hutt is unknown. The larger and obviously more dominant Hutt begins to speak, like all arrogant Hutts, in his own language. Thankfully Lee already knows it, and won't have to lower himself to asking for a translator.
***"I am Goodo. You owe my cousin a large sum of credits, and he owes me. You have proven a touch too dangerous for him to control, so he has brought you to me. In my benevolence I have decided to grant you an unique opportunity. Listen, and listen well,"*** the massive Hutt thunders as he turns to wave at the screen mounted on the circular wall behind him. It displays a map of a large city, several advertisements for a variety of businesses owned by Goodo, a still photo of Lee's mother drinking tea with Hoodo, and a spread sheet of ever changing figures and odds.
***"This,"*** he says, pointing to the map, ***"Is Killee-Kor, a city that has become incredibly profitable. Here, you will advertise my businesses. You will compete in the famous Arenas of Killee-Kor, and you will do so using my products exclusively, in my name. You may keep your winnings to live on and to pay off your debt to my cousin. Should you try to leave the planet you will be hunted down, and you and your mother killed. Should you shop elsewhere your mother will be harmed. Your clothing will be provided, and you will be given a sum of five thousand credits to bankroll your beginnings in the Arena,"*** at this a Gammorean approaches and lays a suit of clothes beside Lee, the chest and back emblazoned with Goodo's advertisements, and a credit chip.
***"Perform well and you will buy your way out of slavery quickly, and possibly make a tidy profit. Or I may have you, and your mother, sent to a spice mine or flesh house, where you will both die long before your debt is paid off. What say you?"***

Standing completely erect, like a soldier, Lee listens carefully to Goodo's introduction. He tries to take in as much as he can through his peripheral vision, while looking at the Goodo.
*It's ironic that my mother pushed me to learn all the trade languages,* he ponders as he watches Goodo, *and now she is the threat held over me.*
He waits patiently for the Hutt to finish, paying attention to his words as best he can. He fidgets occasionally as his bindings cut into his arms and wrists.
Looking straight at the picture of his mother, seeing the fear in her eyes, Lee clears his dry throat and replies in Huttese.
**"I understand…sir. I understand that I am to fight in this arena, and until I pay you back for this debt. I would normally argue, but you are very persuasive. Is this 5000 credits the sum total of what I owe, or is it to be added to the amount? If so, how much is this amount that I owe?"**
He looks down to the clothing thrown at his feet. He looks to be blinking back tears, and speaks through a clenched jaw.
**"Please release my arms and hands, you hold my cooperation by a tighter bond than these."**

Goodo turns to tap out a sequence on a datapad, ***"Your current balance is twenty thousand, including the bankroll. You will be charged daily for your mother's upkeep, and I am only charging you a one time fee of five hundred for the clothing. Interest will begin accruing on your first day in the Arena, at a 17.8% rate. Any delinquencies will net you a five hundred credit fee and a beating, three delinquencies a death sentence. Your monthly minimum payment will be calculated based on performance and sales, and will not be lower than one thousand credits or the balance, which ever is lower. Your payment will be allocated towards interest first, then the principal. Cut him loose,"*** Goodo's bass rumble hashes out the legalese with frightening speed, and the nearest Gammorean steps forward and cuts Lee's bonds. The fresh blood-flow is amazingly painful.
***"Take him to the nearest Goodo's Munitions and Supply, then turn him loose. I expect great revenue from you, Lee Fole. Do not disappoint,"*** Goodo thunders.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

There are 6 Gammoreans and two Hutts. The only weapons you can see are on the guards and consist of a variety of vibro weapons. There are two Hutt size exits, one before and one behind. The room seems to be the Hutt equivalent of an office.
As for the debt, I wouldn't worry about it now, you can always try to negotiate a better deal (or pay someone to) later. When your ready, I'll fast forward till after you've picked your gear up and are set loose in the city.

His mind reeling at the numbers flying at him, Lee grimaces as the circulation returns to his arms and hands. He sighs in resignation.
*"Make a profit from all parties involved…"* Lee ponders as he gathers up the clothes on the floor, *"that's the Hutt way. No use in arguing with him now. I will have to wait until I have more information on what happened."*
He stands up, dizzy for a moment from his healing injuries, and speaks again in Huttese:
**"As you wish."**
Lee looks to the Gammorean's as the close in, head held high. He nods when they grunt, and follows their lead out of the chamber.

The guards lead him from the palace and to a speeder, stopping briefly to allow Lee time to change. Lee notices the clothing will, at random, give a high volume sales pitch in one of many languages and is prone to projecting holo-advertisements from his chest and back. The lettering on the shirt and pants also lights up in a repeating pattern.
As they reach the speeder the guards withdraw and a Rodian climbs in behind the controls. He introduces himself a Peebles, and takes Lee to the closest Goodo's Munitions and Supply, where Lee spends a large chunk of his bankroll, assuming the attitude of 'Go big or go home' or in his case, 'Go big and maybe not die.' As he returns to the speeder Peebles is waiting for him, asking in Bocce **"Where to chief? Hotel, Arena, what? If its an Arena, we'll head out to Tier Six, it's where all the noobs start."** Peebles seems well used to driving people around, and can fill empty silence with meaningless but good natured chatter without being annoying about it. He also seems to know the city and its traffic well, expertly maneuvering through even the heavy parts this close to the city center.

Alright, where do ya wanna go? the Palace isn't far from the Crimson Axe, so you can pick which Tier Six Arena you want to begin in.

## Re: Guerrilla Marketing

### **Berwick** (2011-05-22 01:13:36)

Replying in Bocce:
**"Well, Peebles,"** Lee says as he repacks some of his purchases to make things easier to carry, **"no sense in spending any more money until I can prove I can make some. To the arena."**
He looks about as he talks, noticing the general state of affairs about him, seeing the desperate faces of so many people.
**"I am a …what was that…noob, as you say. Which arena's are there in Tier Six? You know what…take me to the one closest to Goodo's Hospital. That way, I won't have far to drag myself after a fight."**
As he speaks, his chest explodes in an advertisement, **"Welcome one and all! Come on down to Goodo's Arms and Supply! Come get a great deal on powerpacks! First time customers, buy four, get one free! When you want supplies, come to Goodo!"** The add finishes with a holo-display of fireworks and a neon blinking sign reading: "GOODO!!"
Shocked by the random and unexpected display, Lee shakes his head slowly and sighs.
**"Mark my words, Peebles…this suit is going to be the death of me."**

Peebles eyes bulge at the shirt, **"Heh!"** he barks as he fires up the speeder. **"I wouldn't blame you if you broke that thing, if they ask tell 'em it happened in a match. Probably cheap components anyway."** They pull up and away from Goodo's Arms and Supply he says, **"There's a Goodo's Hospital and Supply near almost all the Arenas m'man, that's the best location. Hmmm…"** he thinks for a moment, scanning the news-feed on the dash.
**"Welp, there's a gang war of some kind near Six-One, and Droid Quarter's no good, Goodo's got no hold there. Wearing that get-up you may get shot before you risk the Arena. Six-Three is right outside the Quarter, as is Six-Five. Six-Four is dead in the Quarter, no hospitals but lots of repair shops, heh! So that leaves Six-Six and Six-Two. Six-Two is a better neighborhood, and the local GH&S has some stiff competition from some Ithorian goody-goodies. Wanna go bolster that GH&S with some advertising?"**

## Re: Guerrilla Marketing

### **Berwick** (2011-05-28 23:49:30)

Nodding as Peebles lays out the various arenas, Lee squints his eyes at the sky for a moment in thought.
"Better get to this Six-Two arena then? If that is where I can advertise best, then that would be good as any I suppose."
He rests easy in his seat as Peebles sets off in the landspeeder towards the destination.
Lee watches the people as they go by. He notices a gradual change from poorer neighborhoods, to better off ones. He sees less desperation and more hope, but still bloodlust.
*"Don't forget, Lee,"* he ponders as he watches the better dressed folks cheering at vidscreens of the matches, *"these folks want their bloodsport just as much…can I be like them? Can I kill? … For money?"*
He looks off into the distance as Peebles closes in on his current destiny. He remembers those lessons in basic training for the Imperial Army. He smirks at how naive he was, and just shakes his head.
**"One last question. After I finish the match, assuming I live, and deal with the hospital…where is one of Goodo's hotels in relation to the Hospital?"**

**"Oh it ain't far, I'll be around to give ya a lift if need be,"** Peebles responds before breaking into a long-winded rant about the music scene in Killee-Kor. A short flight later he sets the speeder down in front of Tier 6's Arena 2, and Lee finds his way inside the massive hexagonal stone building. Inside, he finds two droids on either side of the main lobby, one taking bets and the other making match arrangements.

## Re: Guerrilla Marketing

### **Berwick** (2011-06-03 00:47:48)

Looking up to take in the arena, Lee scratches his head and sucks in his breath.
That cold clammy feeling climbs up his spine, causing him to shiver for a moment.
*I will kill…I will…*
He looks to both droids, gathering their function from watching others interact with them.
*I have no choice now…I must…for mom.*
With another breath, Lee walks up to the droid taking bets. He waits for the droid to be finished with the rather scuzzy couple in front of him, and then clears his throat to get its attention.
**"How much to place a bet?"**
He hesitates for a moment...
**"How much to place a bet on myself? I want to place a 100 credit bet that I will survive."**
*No sense in not betting I suppose. If I win, that is less time here…If I lose…*
He ponders the response for a moment.
[ooc]Giving myself some leeway here, and looking to get in to that arena![/ooc]
His business concluded, he walks over to the other droid.
**"Hello there."** He adjusts his head to align with what he thinks is its eyes, then laughs at himself.
**"I am ready to fight. What do you need from me to let me in."**

The first droid takes the hundred cred chip from Lee and hands him a voucher, an electronic chip displaying the value of his bet and his odds/payouts, currently listed as one to one. As he moves to the second droid and makes his query the droid responds, **"All that is needed is a suitable wager and a choice of opponent."** It turns and gestures to the board behind it, and several entries scroll into view.
Togorian: Power Hammer and Utility belt, 1500 credit Purse
Cerean: Commando Special Rifle with Double Trigger, 1500 credit Purse

Lee grimaces.
*Stupid. Of course you get crappy odds. You are an unknown, you haven't fought yet, and you don't know who you opponent is going to be. That and they may not like gladiators betting on themselves.*
Shaking his head as he moves over toward the other droid, he makes up his mind.
*No more betting 'till you have better odds. You aren't gonna free Momma in a day, and you need to focus on survival. Just one foot in front of the other.*
He looks at the droid as it responds.
He holds out his rifle in response, allowing the droid to scan it.
He says, loudly so that others around him may hear him, **"Recent purchase from GOODO's Equipment and Supply."**
After the droid accepts his wager, Lee looks to the list of possible opponents.
His face is a slack mask as he ponders, *Heard scary things about Cerean's…and Twi'leks are fast and agile…Togorians. Haven't heard anything about them, soo…might as well.*
**"I'll take the Togorian please."**

Several eyebrows (or appropriate equivalent) are raised at the declaration of vendor, and the droid approves the wager. Many more are raised/twitched at the choice of opponent, and the chip voucher in Lee's hand chirps. Looking down, he sees the odds have changed 5:1 in the Togorian's favor.
The droid says, **"You will be fighting in… pit two,"** and again the chip voucher beeps, the odds having changed to 2:1 in the Togorian's favor. The droid gives directions to the pit, and Lee sets off.

Walking through the hallways, Lee hears the distant echo of crowds cheering and shouting.
*Bloodsport…these people…they want blood…*
He shook his head, and checked his rifle again, trying to get comfortable with it.
*That droid reacted awfully strange when I made my choice of opponents…and those people sure did raise an eyebrow or three…*
Suddenly searching his memory for any information, Lee furrowed his eyebrows.
*Togorians…hmm…*
Lee continues to think, walking along the corridor, and towards a test of his mettle.

### **Magical2099** (2011-06-14 05:53:27)

Lee remembers hearing one of his drill instructors tales of Togorians: **"Bigger than Wookies with none of the honor. Feline predators, brutes. A lot like Gammoreans but more dangerous cause they're cunning. My advice? Burn them quick, single them out before they get the chance to think you're a challenge. Don't get close, and for the love of the Force if you have to leave 'em alive don't make 'em hate you, if you do you'll never see 'em coming later. And they WILL come back later."**
With these words echoing in his head Lee finds pit two, and a old and beaten battle droid with NON-COMBATANT painted across its chest. The droid plays a recording, **"Welcome and good luck. When the gate opens down your opponent, then you will be introduced to the crowd and given your wager and purse. Any questions?"** Through the door behind the droid Lee can see a cage, and down a long hallway he can barely make out another cage with battle droid and a towering being probably receiving the same recording. Lee steps forward and sees his opponent do the same, and the lights in the pit lower.
A booming voice rings out from loudspeakers around the Arena: **"COME ONE, COME ALL TO THE KILLEE-KOR ARENA!!! THIS AFTERNOON FOR YOUR VIEWING PLEASURE WE HAVE YOUNG TOGORIAN BUCK AND YOUNG HUMAN WHO SEEMS TO ALREADY HAVE A SPONSOR!!! LET'S HOPE HE'S WORTH IT, EH? HAHAHA! BEGIN!!!"**
As the cages open the Togorian comes out of his like a landslide, crashing and moving far to fast for something so large. He crosses half the pit before Lee realizes the time has come...
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Just list your modifier, then roll the dice, I'll total them up. He won the initiative and acted, so its on you. The blue things are shields, the center area (where the Togorian is right now) is rough terrain, and the brown things are barricades (if you are adjacent, they provide low cover). Good luck, and welcome to the Arena!

Lee shakes his head answering the NON-COMBATANT droid in the negative.
He steps through, eyeballing his opponent, remembering his D.I.'s advice about Togorians. The memory haunts him as the announcer finishes, and he shakes off the vestiges of the memory as the Togorian rushes forward.
Shaking himself awake, Lee gulps, and sets his jaw. He immediately brings up his carbine, and squeeze's off a shot. A deep red bolt flies away, and Lee leans forward to start moving....soon.

The blast catches the Togorian in the abdomen, and staggers it briefly. Unfortunately, judging by the roar that escapes its throat, the pause is only temporary. Soon the furred mountain is moving again, charging forward at breakneck pace, quickly closing the distance. The crowd quickly reaches its feet as the first shot lands doesn't seem to hamper its victim, the fast pace of the match has them cheering frantically.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Short range for rifles is 30 squares, so you took no penalty. Since he's using a run action he's also taking a reflex penalty, so you hit like a champ. Your devastating attack is canceled by his large size, and you did not break his damage threshold. On to round two.

Realizing that the onrushing wave of fur and teeth was about to crash upon him, Lee pulls a grenade off his belt, and hucks it at the Togorian with a quick underhand throw. As the pin bounces off the ground, he turns his body for a moment, to shield his face from shrapnel. After the blast, he quickly opens his eyes, and sets himself to receive the charge.

The Togorian sees the grenade and leaps, to late to avoid the majority of the shrapnel. He lands with a pained hiss and rolls, coming up moving faster if anything, swinging a hammer the size of a small child straight at Lee's midsection...
Where it connects dramatically, slamming the human to the wall. The resonating thrum-BOOM of the power hammer echoes through the pit and the crowd, which seemed fit to burst, is now silent, wondering if the human could have survived such a blow...

Slamming back against the wall, Lee yells an incoherent scream as the air is blasted out of his lungs. For a moment, the hammer connecting with his midsection, pinching against the wall, is the only thing keeping him on his feet.
As the Togorian recovers from his swing, bringing the hammer back around, Lee screams in his face, his eyes a deep window to his rage...and all Lee sees is that picture of his mother on that Hutt's wall.
Lee bounds forward, following the upswing of the hammer, trying to get behind the Togorian to regain control of the situation. He executes a tight button-hook to his left to follow the return swing of the hammer, turning to make sure the Togorian is not behind him.
*Sweet Maker!* Lee ponders as he moves around the Togorian, *Another hit like that, and I will be dead!*
He examines the battlefield quickly, and makes a snap decision, realizing that the pit of rubble in the middle may be his only hope.

The Torgorian swings the hammer again, this time lower, trying to take the legs out from under the fleeing human. Lee scrambles and hops, avoiding the flailing hammer, and circles round behind the feline. The Togorian never looses his opponent's position though, allowing the hammer's weight to bring him round full circle. He takes a step to catch up to Lee before bringing the hammer up over-head, and crashing downwards like an avalanche. Lee throws his body to the side and the thrum-BOOM of the hammer striking the floor drowns out the roaring crowd again. The battered human can't help but wonder if his hearing will be damaged by hammer's infernal noise.

Lee hops over the low swinging hammer, to just as quickly throw his body to the side as the gravity hammer crashes into the stone floor, causing a visible shock wave of sand to blow outward. He shakes his head quickly to clear the sand from his vision, and to refocus, eardrums quaking from the sound.
Lee's movement continue fluidly, as he steps back staying light on his feet again, shifting his body weight back and forth quickly to find his center.

Lee retreats again, and he can see the frustration in the Togorians eyes and movements as the feline gives chase. The creature steps to the side and comes at Lee again, massive hammer swinging underhanded, threatening to knock Lee flying should it connect... Which thankfully it does not.

Technically, it would be withdraw on square east, then one south, but the end result is the same.

Lee sucks in his stomach, as the hammer moves by, mere centimeters for knocking him flying. He uses his momentum to retreat 4 more meters away. As the large Togorian roars in his face, Lee gulps, hoping his strategy will hold long enough for him to break away. He had settled into a rhythm with this fight, ducking and weaving around the enraged cat-man, calming his breath and starting to get his head back in the game from his earlier injury.

The Togorian takes the bait once again, following closely and trying to connect with his slippery opponent. His frantic chasing appears to have worn out even his powerful frame as the blow seems halfhearted at best. Lee sees an animal cunning shining in the beast's eyes though, giving the lie to the supposed fatigue...

Lee's nostrils flare and his eyes go wide at the sudden notice of deception...
*"Gotta move, gotta move…this thing is going to use me for a scratchin' post! THIS COULD HURT!"*
Finally catching his breath and stride, Lee shuffles back in a dangerous move. He momentarily presents a target, turning his back to sprint a few meters away, sliding to a stop on the rocks and grit of the arena floor. He turns back about quickly as his feet arrest his forward momentum, facing furry death once again.

[*]Move action: move 4 squares south. I need him to move that far, so I don't know if I can qualify for a "withdraw" or not, if this incurs AoO, that is fine. I also realize this opens me up to a charge possibly, but I wanted to get into position to squash this kitty…if Lee survives…WATCH OUT!

Lee breaks again, going further this time. The gleam in the Togorian's eye disappears and is replaced by a hunger as he realizes he has room to build up momentum for another killing strike. The brute rushes forward, his weapon cutting an arc through the air as it comes in from Lee's left... and misses by a good bit. The feline hisses in frustration again. The crowd cheers half heartedly, growing slightly tired of the cat and mouse.

You can withdraw that far, its one square and then half your movement. You are back to full on the CT, and this does open you up for a charge.

Suddenly grinning at his stroke of luck, Lee pivots on his foot, pushing all his weight forward to sprint away from the Togorian, running all out for the rubble.
*It's go time! Now or never…*
He moves quickly, trying not to twist an ankle in the rubble, and stops. He pivots back suddenly and snaps his carbine up up, pointed directly at the cat-man.

Lee turns to escape again, this time not being as careful since his goal is in sight. The Togorian's mighty hammer follows the fleeing human, trying to crush his skull. The only thing harmed, however, is the well battered floor and the Togorian's pride as he misses. Lee could feel the air off the passing hammer-head. Lee hurries into the rubble, knowing the feline cannot abuse his size and weight there. The Togorian quickly gives chase, and keeps up with the human.

Sweat rolling down his brow, Lee shakes his head quickly to get it out of his eyes.
Realizing, perhaps too late, that the terrain around him would limit his tactical options, Lee sets his jaw.
*It's now or never….*
He brings his rifle up, sights in quickily, and pops off a shot, moving as quickly as he can to lead the cat-man along, crouching to maintain his defensive advantage...

Lee's quick-scope skills pay off as the Togorian roars in pain, his left shoulder a smoldering bloody wound. The crowd livens up a bit, cheering faintly. The wound doesn't slow the beast down though, and its hammer seeks Lee's retreating form. While the wound may not slow him down it does affect his aim as he misses Lee yet again, and once more for good measure as he closes with the human. The Togorian takes a deep breath and shakes off the pain of his wound, determined to see this through to the end in spite of his failures so far.

You're fighting defensively, so you take a -5 to your attack, scoring 18, which still hits. Since you attacked your ref is 17.

Shifting slightly, Lee moves with the Togorian, shuffling backwards through the rubble, pausing to suck in his belly as that massive hammer passes by.
He drops into a stance quickly, fires off a round, and shifts to stay light on his feet. He sets his jaw in grim determination, as he realizes that the time for thinking is over...just action.
*Now the dance is over…time for the kill.*

Lee fires, his bolt passing over the Togorian's head closely. As Lee retreats again the Togorian tries to capitalize on his opponent's continued lowering of his defenses. He misses yet again, drawing hisses and boos from the crowd. The shame and frustration is clear on his face, and he moves forward determinedly, striking his foe a terrible blow.

Grimacing as his bolt flies off target, Lee snorts and dodges the inevitable hammer swing.
He grunts, and pivots, moving quickly toward the south side of the arena, stopping short to pivot back around and fire quickly.
He sets himself, ready for the onrushing kitty.

Lee manages to dodge the Wookie-cub sized hammer, and with one last squeeze of the trigger his foe drops. The crowd cheers and jeers, both a result of agonizingly long bout. The announcer's voice crackles over the intercom, **"WE HAVE A WINNER!!! THIS HUMAN HAS PROVEN THAT SIZE MATTERS NOT, EH? HAHAHA!!! LET'S HEAR HIS NAME!"**
A worn battle droid with Non-combatant in bright yellow across its chest approaches and hands Lee a comlink which crackles and stutters across the Arena intercom. It then strips the weapon and utility belt off the corpse, waiting to hand them over as well.

Assuming you spent the Destiny point. Update your character sheet and congratulations, you've survived your first match. Add a standard utility belt and Power Hammer to your sheet, along with 500 XP, 1500 credits, and your Fame Rating is now 1.

As the droid approaches with the comlink, Lee walks calmly over to the corpse of the Togorian. His breath comes in ragged gasps as he puts a foot on the body.
Looking up into the crowd, he pauses, and fires one last bolt through the head of the corpse.
He looks up as the comlink chatters and squelches...
"Lee...shop at Goodo's."
He hands the droid the comlink, gathers his prize and walks back to open door at his end of the pit.
_ | / _
Looking around as he walks from the arena, Lee stops on the breezeway before the arena entrance.
The landspeeders zoom by, their exhaust and noise mixing as his pulse races.
*"Perform well…or…mother…sent to a…flesh house…."*
The words of the Hutt rang through his mind, combining with the sickening exhaust and smells of sweat and blood. The smell of charred Togorian fur bold in his nose.
"*What say you?*"
He drops to his knees, fighting for breath, as his mind's eye sees the Togorian laid out...dead.
"*What say you?*"
Retching violently, he gasps as the cold dead eyes of the Togorian morph into his mother's.

Sometime later, after having found Peebles and the airspeeder, Lee moves to sit down in the seat, grimacing in pain.
"How 'bout that hospital we talked about earlier, eh Peebles?"
He dumps his loot in the back of the vehicle.
"I would thank you for all this, but I am pretty sure this is being added to my tab. Even so...thanks."

**"LEE OF GOODO'S!!! HOW'S THAT FOR ADVERTISING?! EVERYONE GIVE HIM A HAND!!!"** the announcer thunders as the crowd cheers Lee on his way out.
Before Lee makes it out of the Arena a droid stops him, **"Sir, you'll be needing this,"** handing him a Yellow Arena Badge. **"It gives a measure of safety in the streets. Also, do you have your wager chip? Your match is done, you may collect your winnings,"** it takes the chip and swipes it in it's built in reader before handing Lee another 400 credits. **"There you are sir, your wager of 100 credits and the payout of your victory at 3:1 odds. Would you like to purchase an Arena-Pad? It allows wireless access to the Arena-Net from anywhere in Killee-Kor."**
As he hits the speeder and gives its driver directions Peebles replies, **"Eh? Congratulations my man! And don't worry, I'm salaried. We'll be at GH&S in no time. What did you fight?"** he asks, along with a dozen other questions about the fight. By the time he finishes asking the speeder has arrived at Goodo's Hospital and Supply and he quips, **"Well hell. I'll drive slower next time. See you in a bit. Ask for Kaleena, she'll set you up right,"** he says as he flips the switch to open Lee's door.
((OOC Add another 400 credits and an arena badge to inventory, if you want the Arena-Pad they're 500 credits. OOC))
