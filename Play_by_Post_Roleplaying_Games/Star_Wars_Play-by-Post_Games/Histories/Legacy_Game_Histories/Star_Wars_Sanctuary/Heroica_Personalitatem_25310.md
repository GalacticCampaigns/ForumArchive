Appearance: Ed is a young thing though only a year younger than Will at the tender age of fifteen. Their eyes are different, always had been strangely, she taking a very strange shade of pale blue. Their mother had said it was from an ancestor, but it was so strange that she inherited it. Her hair is short, very much like the boys that ran around their town and always in a state of mess, sticking up at odd angles and seemingly untameable. Her hair is technically brown, but is forever being dyed; currently in a lavender shade. She dresses in her brothers old clothes and takes to hiding as much of her being a girl as possible...mostly out of habit, though as she gets older it's getting harder to hide without hats. She still using it to her advantage, looking like a pretty boy is better than a girl, which is just fine to her, then more she doesn't look like a forger or a threat the better.

Background:
Ed's story isn't all that exciting, not like Will's certainly though they aren't far off from each other. They lived with their mother when Ed was very small, well small for her in the eyes of must people but than a nine year old is generally small, though not much is remembered. Only that Will was Ed's whole world and loved the things he could do when he really focused, which was good really since Ed was usually getting into trouble, and thus getting him into trouble. But he was a good brother. And then one day some people came to their home, dressed in robes, when Will was ten. Mother wouldn't let Ed stay in the room, said to play in their room instead, she was afraid but Ed didn't know why; so naturally Ed snuck out and caught the end of the conversation. Her brother had passed some sort of test and was going to be trained, to be a Jedi! A Jedi! How exciting! Ed had grinned and ran off to pack their bags, because why would he go without Ed? They did everything together.
When Ed ran into the room with two bags and grinning, their mother paled, and Will hugged Ed but the people said only Will could go. Why? Who would get him into trouble? Ed had to go! The people had smiled, that smile mother gave when she was humoring Ed and told him to say good bye. Ed had run after them until mother had caught up, Ed cried for three days and refused to leave their room. How could they separate them? Ed didn't understand. How could they? They couldn't. Simply as that, Ed'd find out where they went and follow them. On day four Ed left their room in Will's old clothes and ran out into town to get what information was available...which...wasn't a lot. They were no help. So Ed started on computers, sloppily hacking that got better and better but still nothing, Ed didn't know what to really look for. Finally, Mother caved and gave the coordinates that they had gone to. A location. Ed made plans, used the new found computer skills to make fake credentials for travelers and people trying to hide, all under a new name; L. It was still a shock when Mother passed in the night, she had been sick but hid it. They hadn't been rich, not poor either but mother had been sick often and bills were hard to pay. Ed never knew what had caused mother to leave so suddenly but with the credits earned and what was left from selling everything to Ed's name, Ed was able to pay off the bills. And using the new skills in forging credentials, Ed put herself on Ship manifests and made the long trek to the Jedi Academy. Determined, a little stronger in mind than before, Ed searched for Will, latched on, and refused to let go. Stating to the older Jedi that if they tried to send Ed away, Ed would just come back.
Now, at the older age of fifteen Ed loved to watch Will train, and continue to get them both in trouble on occasion of course while earning credits for themselves on the side...not that Ed would tell him just how those credits were coming in...he didn't need to know that. He'd only worry.

<details><summary>Background</summary>

As all Miraluka have a natural connection to the Force, no one usually looks twice when a child with such a gift is born, unless the child shows to be either uncommonly weak or strong with the Force. With Valen, it was the latter. As described by his mother, the child had been literally radiating with the power of th Force from the moment she gave birth to him, and she knew from that moment that it would be his destiny to be away from her, to serve the Galaxy as one of its fabled Jedi guardians. But she would not let him go, not yet, and he would remain with his family until such a time she felt that he as ready to leave.
And so, for the first eight years of his life, he would be raised by his parents, who would teach him how to use the Force, and how to separate the darkness from the light. In particular his father, who had studied the ancient Miraluka tradition of Luka Sene, emphasized that he learn this distinction to heart. It would not be until later in his life that he would learn the reason for this though. And come his eight birthday, his parents told him that it was time to leave. A little surprised and confused, he did follow his parents as they brought him to Ossus.
As he was reluctant at first to join the Jedi Order and leave his family, his parents would finally reveal to him the visions they had had when he was born. It was his destijny to become a Jedi Knight, they said, just as it had been the destiny of his ancestors. When he first opened his eyes, his father had seen a fleeting image of a tall human with brown hair towering over the child and his mother as a ghost. Dressed in Jedi robes and with a lightsaber hanging at his side, the male had locked eyes with Valens father, and in a vision he had been taken back to a distant time and was allowed to witness a duel between the man and a younger human. As lightsabes clashed, the elder male seemed to gain the advantage, and eventually his opponent fell to his knees, and was struck down. The last segments of the vision showed him how the brown-haired human cried out in pain, and then it was gone, along with the ghost.
Doing some research into the mysterious pictures of the vision, Valens father had deduced that what he had been shown had been nothing less than a vision from the Battle of Ossus which had iccured nearly four millenia ago, and that the Jedi spirit who had shown him the scenes had been none other than the ghost of Ulic Qel-Droma himself, the fallen Jedi who had been the apprentice of the Sith Lord Exar Kun, but had redeemed himself by betraying Kun to the Republic. Determined to understand the connection between this ancient character and his family, he searched for any clues he could find about Qel-Droma, and eventually he was stunned to learn that there was a very real possibility that the two families were connected by blood. While it had been mixed and thinned over the centuries, even by the rare mix of Human and Miraluka, and while he could not pinpoint exactly whether it was through him or his wife, he grew more and more certain that his son was indeed a blood heir to Ulic Qel-Droma. And, it seemed, the elder Jedi had returned from the netherworld of the Force with a purpose for his son.
Certain that he should not – and could not – stand in the way of destiny, he took the tale of Ulic Qel-Dromas rise and fall to heart, and was determined to raise his boy to be better prepared to face the dangers of the Dark Side, beleiving this to be the reason why the ghost had appeared to him. And now, finally, had come the tale for Valen to take his first steps towards fulfiling that destiny. Reluctantly accepting his parents wishes, Valen agreed to stay at the Jedi Academy. Before leaving, his father told him that there was a place on Ossus that he should visit when he was ready. When asked what place it was, Valen was only told that the Force would guide him there in time.
Valen soon grew over his reluctance to join the Jedi, and found himself enjoying the training and the company of the other younglings. Inspired by the last words his parents had told him, he worked hard to excel at any task set before him, aspiring to become a great Jedi. Growing a bit beyond his years, he indulged himself in all aspects of the Jedi ways, even applying interest to study other traiditons of the Force, particularly the Miraluka tradition of Luka Sene.
Four years after he joined the Academy, on the day he turned twelve, he woke up in the middle of the night with a strange sensation that something was calling him. Sneaking out of his chambers, set of into the Ossus night, moving quickly through the terrain. He travelled for at least a few hours, gudied only by a strange feeling, and evenually came upon what appeared to be ancient near the foot of one of the many mountains in the area. As he entered the ruins, he felt the strange sesation growing stronger, and suddenly he watched a thin, luminous being materialise in front of him.
While he already felt certain of its identity, the spirit introduced itself as Ulic Qel-Droma, and told Valen that it had been waiting to bring him to this place. When he asked, Ulic told him that they were standing in the ruins of an old spaceport, and that it had been the place where Ulic had faced and slain his brother Cay, his mind corrupted by darkness. He said that he had brough Valen there to make him realize the danger that awaited down the dark path, but also to teach him an important lesson. While Ulic realized that his mind had been influenced and corrupted by ancient Sith spirits and Exar Kun, it had always remained his own. And thus, the decision to kill his brother had also been his own. The importance of this lesson, he said, was that one can never blame ones actions on anything or anyone.
Acknowledging the wisdom behind the words, Valen was still curious as to why the spirit had called him. Ulic told him that the time had come to end his life as a youngling, and that he had reached the proper age to become a padawan. The future had a purpsoe for the young Miraluka, possibly of greater importance than they could imagine, and Ulic intended to make sure he was ready for it. While he understod that it would be informal, and that technically he would still be a learner, Valen accepted this offer, and from that day on, he vowed to double his already considerable efforts to become worthy of his legacy.
Four long years have now passed since that fateful encounter, and it has surprised many that Valen has not been taken as a padawan yet, given his apparent skills. Valen himself, however, isn´t overly concerned, and in fact enjoys training with the other younglings in the temple. On occasion, he has helped as an assistant instructor in classes for the youngest, and he realizes the training such tasks give him. He does, however, long a bit for the time when he will be allowed to leave Ossus and travel the Galaxy to maintain the order.

</details>

<details><summary>Appearance</summary>

Valen has the build of a well-trained human male, rather tall despite his age of 16 years. Like all Miraluka, he lacks natural eyes and covers his eye sockets with a piece of red cloth, tied up in the neck. Along with his short, dark hair, this gives his appearance a certain contrast against the colors of typical Jedi robes. This, as well as his personal preference and taste causes him to dress in simple and practical clothes - a pair of plain and sturdy gray pants, military-style boots, a red sleeveless vest, and a rugged heavy cloak for when the weather is harsh

</details>

<details><summary>Personality</summary>

Valen is an outgoing and cheerful person, and even though he can appear older than his age, he usually gets along well with people and easily makes friends. Despite his natural talent with the Force, he aim to conquer arrogance and constantly seeks to improve himself rather than getting comfortable, a trait that has led to him exploring a vast amount of various areas of skill.

</details>

<details><summary>Legacy</summary>

At this point, Valen has fully embraced his legacy as the heir of Ulic Qel-Droma, and is determined to be ready when whatever destiny awaits him is finally revealed. Since their encounter on Ossus, Qel-Dromas spirit has not manifested itself to him again, but rather guides and instructs him through impressions and visions. Wanting to know more about his ancestor, Valen has studied whatever records of the peroid of the Great Sith War that he can find, and he occasionally returns to the spaceport ruins to meditate and train in solitude.
He does not know if his legacy is known among the masters and other jedi at the temple, and he doesn´t imagine it would have mattered much if it was, nor does he mind. He don´t brag about it, and he doesn´t think himself special because of it, he just accepts it as fact.

Odette was born to a high ranking Pelagian Lord, Linus Balis, and was his youngest daughter born to him by his wife, Juliet Faris-Balis. With her older sister Tessa (8 years older) and younger brother Joshua (4 years younger), Odette lived in a world of privilege without a want for anything. Like many Tapani nobility of the House, Odette was able to escape the notice of the Jedi as being Force Sensitive. Being Force Sensitive herself, her mother Juliet was able to sense her daughter’s talents and sought to use her daughter's developing abilities to their family's advantage. As Odette got older, however, it quickly became apparent Juliet didn't have the necessary skill to teach her headstrong and talented child. Finding suitable tutors became a challenge until an ex-Jedi crossed her mother's path. Believing in a foundation of discipline, her new Jedi trained tutor, Kal Sran, not only focused on Force training but on self defense as well. While he taught her a great deal about Jedi philosophy, he encouraged her to find her own answers. Over their tenure together, Odette learned she had a knack for manipulating other's perceptions particularly when it came to disguises.
On the cusp of her 18th birthday, Odette is surprised to learn her parents are preparing for her wedding. Betrothed to young Lord Davian Paddox from a prominent family in House Pelagia, Odette finds herself outraged. Secretly for over year she had been seeing, Jonah Batolio, son of a Knight in her father' household. Unable to escape from the betrothal, the two plan to runaway and elope. Over the course of the engagement, she begins to scheme with Kal on how to get away. The day the two illicit lovers plan to elope and leave their life in the Tapani sector behind, their meeting never happens. Arriving at their rendezvous, Odette waits for as long as she can before realizing something must have happened. Making a hard decision, she trusts that he will meet her at their agreed upon destination. Using her natural abilities she makes it appear she's vanished, leaving behind nearly everything but a small horde of credits she had been secretly skimming from her parents meant for the wedding. Odette removes herself from her parents'; and, subsequently, her betrothed's reach and hopes that Jonah will be able to contact her.
Adopting the alias Cera Pell, she goes to Coruscant where she intends to start her new life as a Jedi initiate.

</details>

Odette is slender and just slightly taller than average height. Long strands of curled blond hair threaten to escape the series of braids trapping them as they fall to her mid back. Her top covers only enough of her eighteen year old frame to be modest while her flowing pants are more reminiscent of a skirt. Made of fine materials, her clothing hints to the wealth behind the young woman who wears them even though they are mostly unadorned.
Strong minded and sometimes described as bullheaded, she holds to her ideals even if they are in the wrong. Perhaps surprisingly she is fiercely loyal to those she calls friends and will go out on a limb to protect her friends and family.

**Verin Hyoki**
**Selkath**
**Jedi 1**
</div>

**Appearance**: He stands at 1.5 m and weighs 56.6 kg. He has dark green skin with light green mixed in, to complete his underwater camouflage, and black eyes.
**Personality**: He always seems cool and level headed and he seems to be somewhat of a recluse, that is until he gets to know them and opens up some.
**Background**: At the age of 5 the floating city that he lived in on Manaan was attacked by a band of pirates. During the attack his parents were killed and he was captured and taken away from his home world. He spent 8 years as a captive on board an interceptor-class frigate named Sykosis. During his time as a captive they used him as a cleaner and worker, depending on the slave masters mood. He thought that his entire life would be spent as a slave and he would die without ever actually seeing anything the galaxy had to offer. While he was captive he learned how to speak, read and write basic, though he preferred speaking to the other Selkath captives in his native tongue, Selkath. One day the Sykosis was flying in the Hapes Cluster and attempted to lose a patrol in the Transitory mists. Unfortunately for the Sykosis there bold, yet stupid, move landed them in front of another patrol near the planet Terephon. It was a short fight but the Sykosis was captured by the Hapan Royal Navy. Verin hid while fighting took place on the ship and when the battle was over he was taken into custody. Once it was determined that he was a slave, and not a pirate, they were going to let him go. He decided to stay on Terephon and got a job as a shop keeper. Over time he realized that he could sense things that were not there and sometimes he could influence a patron to make a purchase that they might have been teetering on. A few days after he turned 17 a Jedi, named James Crowburn, came into his shop searching for some supplies. Verin attempted to "persuade" James to buy a few extra items, but failed. After James felt that he was able to use the force he asked him how he would like to learn to hone his skills and become more attuned with the force. Verin took his offer and followed him to Shedu Maad where he began his training as a Jedi. He has only been training for a short time, but he can do far more than he had previously imagined while sitting behind the counter of his old shop. He still carries around a training aid, that had helped him with clearing his mind, that James had given him when he first arrived at the academy. Even though his time on Terephon and at the Academy have been great in comparison to his years on the Sykosis he still prefers to get to know people before he opens up to them.
