One hundred and thirty years after the battle of Yavin, after the fall of the old empire a new war rages. The Jedi`s famed Ossus project failed miserably and set the catalyst for war between the Galactic Alliance and the Fel Empire. The war has spread both the Alliance and the jedi thin in a vain attempt to thwart the the murderous rampage of the new sith order The One.
Corusant itself remains much as it has through the centuries, a city planet very much the center of the galaxy. Streams of traffic hurry about like insects on various multilevel of unseen highway. The jedi Temple a beacon of hope throughout the galaxy remains the exception, little traffic clouds the skies above its pristine walls. Within one of the temples many courtyards five unknowing heroes await.
Towering over the courtyard several giant bronzium statues stand an eternal guard over the jedi below. Throughout the courtyard jedi bustle with activity. Groups of younglings practice lightsaber defense against training droids, while other younglings focus on meditation. Jedi Masters of every description direct their pupils in the ways of the force.
Standing seperate from the others various groups is a line of four young would be padawans, not to far to the side of this short line kneels a young human woman tinkering with a broken training droid. Inspecting the four would be jedi is Master Pash, a small furry floppy eared Bimm. Master Pash paces the length of your small groups line, his yellow robes too long for his diminutive body leave trails in the dirt as he passes.
Master Pash finally comes to a halt looks each of you in the eye in turn, though he has to look up to do so. "Of you each recite the code." Master Pash smiles revealing a row of tiny canine teeth "Pash also say you tell each of code mean to you." Though his galactic standard is very broken Master Pash is widely respected and known for his astute wisdom.

Life at the temple wasn't so bad really. Honestly, it was safe, clean, warm or cold as needed, free food...it was a rather perfect life for Will.
And if Ed had to struggle with broken droids as a means to earning her own keep well that was okay too.
"Stupid piece of.."
Even if she'd rather be out causing trouble and making real credits.
"ow, damn you stop fighting me!"
yes she was talking to a broken droid. No it wasn't talking back. Yes it was making her feel better and after the last time when she threw that one droid against the floor...really she thought she was getting better at the frustration. And in her defense, that had been a bad day; really they should know better than to ask things of her of a moderately violent nature on the anniversary of their mom's death (it use to be passing but then she grew up and started to call things as she sees them, someone said it was a phase. She stole their lightsaber.)
As it happened the more time she spent in the temple it was helping, though it helped more when she was able to keep eyes on Will rather than have to sneak in.
So really....
What was she talking about again?
Oh, Pash was talking. Ah the code again, why couldn't they just talk about binary, honestly that made more sense than the jedi code. At least to her, but hey she wasn't a jedi. Still. She smirked faintly as she spoke up, cue smart ass mode:
"Emotion, yet peace...unless working on a troublesome droid." she kicked the droid in front of her in emphasis and grinned as it shook something loose. Ha, so that was the problem.
"Ignorance, yet Knowledge...the former will get you killed or caught while the latter provides insight into a mark and secrets." She glanced up and eyed the Jedi Masters saber with a chuckle.
"Passion, keeps you loving what you do but Serenity lets you do it well. Unless you need the fire to kick your ass into action." There was a humming coming from the droid and she grinned more, almost there.
"Chaos is fun and provides a distraction while harmony..." she glances towards Will briefly "is a luxury and a freedom, a relaxing point when you're safe."
"Death.." she starts and the droid comes back to life, letting her lean back on her hands and look over to the Master "Is an adventure, is only the beginning, and is for those that give in, and the force is that which he has and I don't." she pointed to Will and grinned widely, brushing streaks of grease through her lilac hair and over her nose. Of all the codes she'd looked through when Will was busy, that was the one she liked best...probably because she could adapt it to herself.
Ah she loved the temple. Getting into trouble, getting under peoples skin, fixing things, and being a general smart ass. Yea, life was good now. Mom would have been proud, well of him...she'd have smacked Ed a long time ago.

A Selkath stands in front of Master Pash wearing gray robes. He has dark green skin with light green mixed in, to complete his underwater camouflage, and black eyes.
Coruscant was a lot different than anywhere else he had been, though he felt at home, and at peace, while he was at the academy. He looked down and watched Master Pash as he and the other younglings were inspected. Master Pash was very wise and he had hoped to learn what he could from him. Pash stopped in front of him and waited for him to recite the code and tell him what he felt it meant.
*What does the code mean to me?*
"**Jedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.
Jedi use their powers to defend and to protect.
Jedi respect all life, in any form.
Jedi serve others rather than ruling over them, for the good of the galaxy.
Jedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training.
I feel that the Jedi Code is a means to help guide us in following the ways of the force in all forms that it can take and it teaches us that there will always be those in the galaxy that will need our help and that we should be there for them and be able to protect them instead of putting ourselves above them. As Jedi we need not seek out power and wealth, but instead through our studies and training shall we become better Jedi and with that we will be able to better help those that need it.**

Will stood in the line with the others as he looked at Master Pash. From the corner of his eye he was able to spot Ed sitting with a defunct droid in her hands. He smiled inwardly at the sight. He envied her as she envied him. She had an ability with mechanical things that just seemed to be binary to him. What came easy to her was hard for him. It used to really bother him to the point that the frustration would take over. It was then odd things would happen that were unexplainable. Coming forward about 7 years into the future he know knew what was happening. It was the Force that he was unknowingly using during his bouts of frustration. Thankfully the training he had received in those years have helped with that frustration.
The voice next to him brought him back to his thoughts. The Padawan to his right was reciting the code and giving Master Pash his interpretation of the words.
It meant something different to everyone. Not one Jedi he had met had ever said the same thing.
His turn came around as he took a steadying breath.
**"Jedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.
Jedi use their powers to defend and to protect.
Jedi respect all life, in any form.
Jedi serve others rather than ruling over them, for the good of the galaxy.
Jedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training."**
His face softened slightly as he spoke. There used to be a different Jedi Code that was used many years ago. He could remember seeing a holo of his great-great grandfather as he recited the older Jedi code before it had been changed by Master Skywalker. He wished he could have asked the man what it meant to him. Then again all those years ago the galaxy was in a state of turmoil like it was now. Somehow the galaxy always seemed to get itself into a fix.
His eyes fell on Master Pash when he realized his mind was wandering and not focused on what he should have been.
With a nod he started again. **"The galaxy will always be in some sort of fix. Sometimes it sorts itself out while other times it takes others to help it along its path. Maybe only a slight nudge is needed to correct its course but we also must be ready to shove back if needed. When the situation is resolved to the best that it can be, because nothing is ever perfect, we fade back into the background letting the galaxy forge ahead along its path once again. In so doing one can hope that they might have learned something about themselves."**
He raised en eyebrow as he went over his words. There was no wrong answer as they were told to tell what it meant to them.

Cera looks down the line for a moment as the Bimm master inspects his small class of prospects. The scrutiny reminds her of the days as a child when her tutors would line her up with her siblings to be drilled by their parents. The thought causes the young woman to fidget with the fabric of her flowing pants for a moment before she finds stillness once more. *That was another life,* she reminds herself. Furtively, she glances down at Master Pash, wondering if he had caught her unease. Kal had always seemed to know her thoughts, but she had always assumed it was because he knew her so well. However, she wasn’t about to put it past a Jedi Master to catch such things.
As the Bimm master reaches her, she’s ready to reiterate the mantra she learned long before coming to the temple proper. While she had never put much thought into it before, there had always been one important lesson Kal had insisted she learn.
Following her companions, she recites the common version of the mantra, and continues on to the next part of Master Pash’s assignment:
“**I think the code is all about patience,**” she starts slowly, pushing away the memories of her tutor’s lectures on the subject.. “**Peace can’t be forced, it has to start from within, and requires patience to ensure that it’s being cultivated. Our actions shouldn’t be hasty since they tend to affect far more than we may realize. It’s only through patient study can we hope to understand ourselves and others, and how we can best serve the galaxy.**”
While the young woman believes in what she’s just uttered, a part of her also scoffs at it. *What part of understanding comes from hiding who you are?* It’s a thought Cera quickly shuts away.

Valen turned his head and followed the Jedi master with his eyes as he passed each of the other assembled students and they recited the code before him. Figuratively, of course, as there was nothing below the piece of red cloth across his face other than two empty sockets. He was able to see just fine though, with the help of the Force, and he could feel it radiate from those around him. When the Bimm passed in front of him, he lowered his head towards master Pash, because even though he couldn´t establish eye contact with him, he wanted to show respect. He waited a moment before opening his mouth, thinking of the Jedi Code and what it meant. It had been set forth by the legendary Luke Skywalker as a reminder of what the Jedi were and what they stood for. But he knew that long before master Skywalker had even been born, the Jedi had recited a different mantra. To him, that Code was even more important, as it not only defined the role of the Jedi, but what it meant to be Jedi.
**Emotion, yet peace…for the Jedi remains calm even when his feelings affect him
Ignorance, yet knowledge…for the Jedi does not know all, but seeks guidance from the Force and others to illuminate and teach him
Passion, yet serenity…for the Jedi lets his passions motivate and strengthen him, but never control him
Chaos, yet harmony…for the Jedi know he cannot forsee everything, but is ready to adapt to the flow of the Force**
He paused a moment before reciting the final line, reflecting over his own experience with those that had passed on into the netherworld of the Force. While the spirit of his ancestor had not visually manifested itself since that fateful day four years ago, he could always feel its presence.
**Death, yet the Force…for the Jedi knows that this life is merely the beginning…**

### **master_Tru** (2013-02-27 09:16:55)

Master Pash watches each of you as you answer in question. The question itself recite the jedi code has been asked and even drilled into your training for as long as any of you can remember, with the exception of Ed of course. Though this was the first time you had been asked what the code meant to you, something feels different about today, not the run of the mill day of training and droid repair any of you had been routinely expecting.
Master Pash proceeds to pace again with his hands now folded behind his back as he does. As before Master Pash stops just before each of you as he walks the length of your small line.
"Verin, spoken from the jedi text directly you have. Learn you must to see what is not text not said." Pash smiles up to you as he continues. "Think both above and below the waves you must." Pash continues down the line.
Master Pash stops before Cera eyeing her conspicuously before continuing. "Spoken thoughtfully have you .... distracted you are, always on the topic not at hand are you are. Focus on the here and now must you do." Pash pauses giving Cera a sideways look before moving on.
Master Pash almost skips by Valen stopping just before he reaches the next student. "Into the historical logs have you been Valen. Older code that is, yet spoken from the text have you. as with Verin beyond the text see you must. Words the text is nothing more, meaning important is more that it is, learn this you must .... learn this will you all." Pashes last statement is set in a low thoughtful tone as if his mind was briefly light years away.
Stopping just before Will Master Pash looks up with a disappointing scowl "Unfocused are you, learn you must to collect yourself aid you it can .... even save you it can." Master Pash continues his walk now heading in the direction of the nearby gardens."With me you walk to meditate on this discussion should we do."
Master Pash pauses to motion to Ed, "Come you will as well, speak to you must I." Master Pash smiles as Ed moves to catch up to the small group of young jedi speaking to the students but speaking loud enough for Ed to hear as well "Interesting so it is, honest answer from one who`s connection to the force least realized it is."
The gardens expand to encircle the courtyard itself comprised of various exotic and in many cases almost extinct plant life. Small birds are varying colors flutter and sway about with the slight changes in the wind. Smaller statues dot this area of the temple, depicting jedi in different states. Meditating, combat, lecturing all hero`s long gone standing as a reminder of past deeds. In the center of a rock garden sits a rather large Ithorian sitting cross legged wearing the brown robes so commonly associated with the jedi. The Jedi has his eyes closed and his hands folded before him, you recognize him as Master Nalto.
It was Master Nalto`s expertise that helped create the surrounding garden, as well as maintain it. "Master Nalto believe you have known already." Master Pash moves into the garden sitting down to meditate. "Come meditate you must, think on the lessons for today. Questions you must have, ask them you must."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-02-27 10:24:26)

If he had not been made almost immune to such impulses by years and years of Jedi training, Valen might have been upset or even taken offense at the words of master Pash. He had recited the code of the old Jedi, that was true, and he had spoken it word by word, yes...isn´t that what reciting means? But he had also given his own interpretation of the code, as asked. The old code demanded it, he thought, since in itself it was just five statements that on their own gave very little. Perhaps, he thought as the group began to walk, that was why master Skywalker had rephrased the code when he sought to bring the Jedi into the Galaxy once again. Perhaps the new Jedi - who did not always became Jedi from the moments they were born, like the knights of old - had been more in need of guidance on how to best serve the Galaxy rather than something that demanded more contemplation of what it really meant to be Jedi.
Not letting his thoughts dwell too much on it, he followed quietly as the Jedi master led them into the gardens. As they walked among the various specimens of plants and birdlife, he could feel the power of the Force surrounding them. This place was full of life, and as such was strong with the Force. Lacking natural sight and perceiving the world entirely through the Force, he was probably more sensitive to this than the others, but he imagined that they would feel it as well. Finding himself a good spot, he sat down and crossed his legs and placed his hands in his lap, forming them into a bowl.
**Master Pash, you asked what the code means to me, and I gave you my answer. So now I would ask the same question of you, what does the Code and each of its tenets mean to you?**

### **zerah** (2013-02-27 14:54:05)

Ed watched the small group head off, taking the rag from a pocket to wipe her hands; she figured she'd take a few minutes rest and watch the droid, make sure it was doing what it was supposed to in case she needed to rewrite some of it's coding. She hoped not. She did actually want to get to some of the other work she had stashed away, really those things didn't make themselves and people were paying good money for them.
Which naturally made her surprised to have Pash talking to her. And wanting to talk to her with the group. She blinked at him before standing and scrambling after him and the group, his words of...of least realized connection to the force. "Wait what?" she called after him, moving to stand beside her brother "Did you hear that? what'd he mean by that?" she asked him quickly before turning to the small Jedi Master "What'd you mean by that?"
Belatedly she realized she was still standing, the others were sitting, right, sit. Ed sat heavily, then frowned and shifted to lay on her stomach, legs bent and faintly kicking in the air while she pouted. It was just to get her to follow, that had to be it, sneaky bastard. Probably had a droid hiding somewhere that needed fixing. She sighed and propped her head up on her palm, idly leaning against Will's leg and toying with a strand of hair.

### **Alicia** (2013-02-27 14:55:20)

The critique leaves Cera sighing internally. He was right of course. Try as she might the young woman found it hard to leave behind the past she wanted desperately to forget. The more she tried to escape it the more she found herself drawing on it; reminding herself of things which only serve as distractions from the tasks set before her.
Falling into step with the others Cera follows the master’s cue to find a place to sit. Taking the relaxed, meditative position she lets her eyes close as she takes in the surroundings in preparation of their meditation. The garden had to be one of her favorite places. There was very little here to distract her from the internal peace she sought. There were times, however, as the wind blew and picked up the copious scents of the flora that she would be reminded of times spent in the garden of her past.
Opening her eyes against the wave of memories, Cera focuses on Valen as he asks Master Pash to answer the question he had put towards them, curious as to whether the Jedi Master would answer.

### **Yogi** (2013-02-28 10:06:58)

Will cringed inside at the response from Master Pash. The thing was is that Master Pash was right. His focus was lost there. He had come a long way in his time here though there were still times that he went headfirst into things without contemplating it first.
His gaze followed Pash as he walked towards Ed. He could see that she was still tinkering with a droid and listened as he spoke with her asking for her to follow also. Without realizing it his head cocked to the side. Normally Ed was left out of the meditation times. This time though his words struck at something that he wasn't sure about. Master Pash said her connection to the Force was the least realized. With an effort to put it to the back of his mind he walked with the others. It didn't work though as Ed was talking to him about what Pash had said.
**"I don't know Ed. He's always speaking on riddles to keep us thinking."**
He took a spot next to Cera and sat in a relaxed position while Ed sat and then flopped onto her stomach beside him. He saw her expression and knew that she wanted an explanation. Question was would Pash give it to her?
Once again he was brought out of his thoughts as Valen asked the same question to Pash. He sat there with his focus on the wizened master waiting on his response.

### **Duggs** (2013-02-28 16:48:15)

He follows Master Pash to the gardens, where he finds himself in front of the wise Master Nalto. Over his time in Coruscant he had grown to enjoy the garden area. He has faint memories of his home planet, but the gardens remind him of the beauty of the underwater chasms that he had swam in as a child. He meditated in the gardens often because it helped him feel at peace, and he found a spot to sit down in front of Master Nalto.
*I must learn from the code what is not in text.*
He closes his eyes and lets the force guide his senses as he hears Valen ask Master Pash the very same question that he had posed on the group.
*Master Pash can tell us what the code means to him, but that won't help me figure out what it means to me.*
He works on clearing his mind so that he can meditate and think about Master Pash's question. He still listens to those that are around him though, to make sure he doesn't miss an instruction or anything.

### **master_Tru** (2013-03-02 09:49:30)

Master Pash eyes closed sitting crosslegged shows no signs of emotion at Valen's question. Already havng reached a state of meditation it takes the jedi master Bimm a few moments to reply, and he does so barely above a whisper. " Much same was answer mine when first asked that question was I. Few could differently answer at so young. A conversation hope to have ..... " Pash stops as if something had just disturbed his meditaion. "Ah master Zessek, welcome."
As if on que to the short introduction from master Pash, master Zessek steps into the clearing. One of the few Besalisk jedi in the order master Zessek is an imposing figure standing just over two meters tall, large muscles shape his stocky frame. Though he wears the brown robes commonly associated with the jedi order master Zessek hold twin double lightsabers on his belt, a rare combination few jedi in the galaxy could master.
Master Zessek looks over your group then down at Valen. In a gruff voice the Besalisk jedi master finishes answering for master Pash. " When you have lived the code you will know the answer." Not waiting for any form of reply Zessek turns to address master Pash. " The shuttle is ready, are your students?"
Master Pash slowly stands an act that seems to put the Besalisk on edge while adding a smile to the Bimm master. " Told them I have not, time for meditation it was ...... "
Once again inturupting master Pash, master Zessek blurts in " They can meditate on route, we need these raw recruits on the front lines." Turning to your group to answer your obvious yet unasked question Zessek continues " You are to accompany myself to the jedi temple on Ossus where if you are lucky you will be chosen as a padawan to a jedi master!"
Master Pash motions to Ed " Walk with me a moment you must." Leading Ed to the side of the clearing just out of ear shot of the rest on the group master Pash smiles up to Ed. For sometime this diminiative jedi has watched over you, providing you with tasks such as the training droid master Pash has made your stay at the temple easily more comfortable. The small jedi master takes your hand into his small furry paw, you understand that he is trying to comfort you for what he has to say. " Arranged have I for you to join your brother on the shuttle to the temple on Ossus. For you a life with the jedi you have, but for your brother a different path before him is. At Ossus the path of a jedi must follow your brother, seperate from your path."
Zessek continues addressing the four of you barely noticing Ed and Pash to the side. " The shuttle departs in two hours, you have until then to collect your belongings and say your goodbyes." Raising his voice as if to address a group of military recruits Zessek states " Any questions?!"

### **zerah** (2013-03-02 20:33:44)

Ed felt that pit in her stomach open and drop, dread...that was the feeling of dread. This didn't sound good, what front lines? she couldn't remember news of wars that would require younglings to join...
Looking up at the request she glanced over to her brother before rolling to her feet and moving to follow the small Jedi Master, pausing when he did though she felt no comfort from his taking her hand. It just made her fears that something was going to go so very wrong scream in her head and down her nerves.
He told her she'd be going too, she wanted to relax she did, if she was going too than everything would be ok! but...
but…
"wh..what?" she asked, eyes wide, they couldn't separate them! Will was all she had left! she traveled the damn galaxy to get back to him!
No…no…calm down Ed…calm down…different path doesn't mean that…that they'd separate us completely…
She breathed deeply, nodding slowly, she understood....she did...he was meant to be a Jedi. she wasn't, she knew that already that wasn't new. Everything would be fine.
I found him once I can do it again if it comes down to it.
"I understand Master Pash." she said, reigning in her emotions, nodding slowly "At least I can go with, thank you."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-03-02 21:52:41)

Valen gave a barely noticeable smile at master Pashs answer to his question. Thinking to himself that perhaps they would have time to discuss the matter more. That would have to wait, it would seem, as they were interrupted by the arrival of master Zessek. He listened attentively to what the Besalisk had to tell them, and he was excited when he learned that they would be going to Ossus. While it sounded like it would be quite different from the last time he was there, he nevertheless had longed to revisit the planet. Master Zessek had mentioned to them that they might be taken as padawans there, and that would be something. Still, he thought, he had already been taken as a padawan there, many years ago. Informally, of course, but still.
Upon hearing that the shuttle would not leave for another couple of hours, Valen decided to heed the words of master Pash and take the opportunity to meditate on the matters at hand. Perhaps it was destiny that called him back to Ossus. The planet where his ancestor had fought in a great battle, and now he too was heading there to fight. He could feel the presence in the back of his head stirring at these thoughts, and remembered that the events that had passed for Ulic there had been all but pleasant. Hopefully destiny would not put Valen in a similar position.
As he pondered these thoughts, he felt his mind becoming more and more clouded, and no definitive answers presented themselves. Taking a deep breath, he began to force these matters out of his head, and opening himself to the Force, letting it wash his troubles and concerns away. The future was always uncertain, but the answers would come to him in time. Still, as he seeks the peace that he can normally find during these meditations, he cannot shake the excitement and expectations from his mind.
((
Since it says that we have 2 hours before the shuttle launches, I´ll take this opportunity to perform my Quiet the Mind regimen.
**Use the Force**

***12*** <- [4] 1d20 + 8

Oh, for the love of...I rolled the very minimum to totally fail the regimen...
))

### **Duggs** (2013-03-03 00:46:51)

He looks up as he hears Master Pash greet Master Zessek. He listens intently on the small conversation that the two Masters had.
*Front lines? I was hoping to spend more time learning from Master Pash, though it will be nice to finally become a padawan.*
He stands as Master Pash takes Ed away. He looks around at the others and composes himself before he speaks to Master Zessek. "**You seem to be in a hurry Master Zessek.**" He says as he takes a few steps towards the Master.
*I have never been to Ossus before. As much as I like seeing new places I am not sure the circumstances for this one will be that ideal.*

### **Yogi** (2013-03-06 13:26:47)

Will was settling into a meditative state. He had finally being able to push the speculative words Master Pash had said about Ed to the back of his mind for the moment. It didn't take long for another voice fall upon his ears. With his eyes still closed the exchange between the two doesn't seem to be the best from what he could determine. Hearing the words "front lines" he opened his eyes to take in the two Masters before him.
From there things moved quickly as Zessek addressed those gathered as Pash took Ed off to the side. Surprisingly, Will was able to keep his focus on the large Jedi Master who asked if there were any questions. Many went through his mind but one was asked first. Waiting for the answer thought ran through his head from finally getting off this planet to having a Master take him on as a padawan. Quickly and easily he reigned in his emotions to a dull roar as he waited for an answer.
OOC:
Will will use the time to gather up all his stuff.

### **master_Tru** (2013-03-08 07:52:58)

Master Pash pats your hand with his paw, his small solid brown eyes lost in thought staring at you before he departs. " Goodbye young Ed, may the force be with you always." With that he leaves you to your thoughts in the garden.
Master Zessek stands in front of Verin for a moment looking down at the youngling. After an awkward pause the jedi master snorts out "Move along youngling we have work to do!" Turning on his heel master Zessek starts to march away, without looking back he orders out "Dismissed!"
Valen still sitting in the rock garden attempts to look inward while reaching out to the force for aid. Trying to calm the chaos of life around him Valen is slightly disheartened when he senses only the confusion around him, younglings panting as they maneuver their lightsabers is defense practice, the buzzing of the training droids small repulsor engines as they work to sway back and forth, the slight breeze as the leaves of the variety of plant life surrounding you. Both chaotic yet harmonious at the same time. Unfortunately clarity escapes you this day.
Gathering your individual belongings for the most part turns out to be an easy task. Like most jedi your group possess little in the way of physical possessions. As you make your way to the temples shuttle hanger word of your departure to Ossus must have spread, few things stay quite for long in this temple. Other younglings pass you on your way to the shuttle hanger with comments like:
"Oh your so lucky."
"Your going to be a jedi."
"May the force be with you."
Even in the nods representing a greeting as you pass both jedi knights and jedi masters. You can see the memory in their eyes as they reminisce thoughtfully on their similar journeys they had taken years or even decades before. Though merely a walk to the temples shuttle hanger today it feels more like a right of passage for most of you. One step closer to further enlightenment on your path to become a jedi. To one of you each step brings you closer to a farewell of which you have no idea to its entirety.
Within the hanger activity can be seen in every corner. From maintenance droids completing final touches on repairs or refueling, to an incoming shuttle with a fresh class of twelve new younglings. Another shuttle preps for departure beside your designated J-1 shuttle. A Gungan jedi master boards with her small blonde human padawan in tow.
Motioning to your group the rather large and unmistakeable master Zessek waves you over from the boarding ramp of a J-1 shuttle. One other youngling waits at the ramp to board with your group. Possible not from the Coruscant temple as you do not recognize the tall gangly human with ruffled brown hair. He bows and introduces himself " Hello I am padawan hopeful Tal Angavel." His voice is soft spoken and as he addresses you his gaze hits the floor.
In stark contrast to Tal Angavels introduction master Zessek in almost a shout states "About time you all got here." He eyes Ed for an awkward moment then continues. "Well get on board we don`t have all day!"
At the top of the boarding ramp a reflective silver protocal droid meets you. "Greetings." The droid bows slightly "I am human cyborg relations D0-DA and I am at your service." It`s courteous voice is suddenly silenced by master Zessek.
"Just fly us to Ossus dooda."
Ever within its protocal programing D0-DA replies "Indeed master Zessek, we can depart on your signal that all are aboard." D0-DA then moves into the ship most likely towards the cockpit as ordered.
Master Zessek also turns to board the J-1 shuttle stating as he goes. "General quarters are on the upper deck, stow your gear and get settled in. We have at least two days before we reach Ossus and a stop along the way." Master Zessek then disappears into the shuttle leaving your group plus one standing before the boarding ramp.

Ed didn't have much, but what she had was more than her brother was allowed, a small mercy she thought. Extra set of clothes (she stole from him when he outgrew them), a handful of datacards, a datapad, a credit chip with the remainder of what she'd earned for them, and her precious kit of tools...her miracle kit. She stuffed it all in a bag she saved from her first trip.
Walking with the others to the shuttle was....weird. They were getting well wishs, and she was...what? following after to fix more droids, really it was strange for her to be there period and she knew that. She knew the looks, she knew the feel of them that..question 'what are you doing here?'
whatever. It didn't matter any more, she had planning to do. She stood with them, keeping beside her own family and watched the *look* go through the Jedi Masters eyes. the hell did he have to feel awkward about? Still...it made her smirk to see it, heh...masters of emotion her ass.
She waited for that dismissal again before she was moving, she didn't really care much about some new Jedi potential more important things on her mind and all, idly tugging Will's sleeve as an old way of meaning 'leaving this way' He use to do it to her hair when he was leaving the room and she wasn't focused on him, a means to get her attention so she didn't freak out, she'd always follow him after. She'd do it to him too, when he wasn't focused on her, or on the room, or if something was going on and he started to...do things with the force. It was like their own language 'Follow me' 'Pay attention to me' 'Look at me' flicks to the skin were the same way 'Stop it' 'Calm down' 'Behave' 'being watched' everything evolved until he left.
Now they had those, and more things, she could tap numbers, tap a *tone* and he'd understand, their own language...and they wanted to separate them again.
Not happening. Not again. They took him once but not again, not without her.

Master Zessek dismisses his question, so he turns to go and gather what little he has. He packs his stuff into his utility belt and then puts it on, then he packs a bag with an extra pair of robes and clothes. As he does this he thinks about how Master Zessek dismissed him.
*I just wanted to know why we are in such a hurry, and what he meant by "front lines". I guess I will find out soon enough.*
He walks next to the others on their way to the shuttle bay, and as he is going he nods to those that congratulate them. It is weird to think that he might be a padawan soon enough. The hanger seemed busy enough, but he sees Master Zessek wave them over to their shuttle. After Tal introduces himself he returns the bow. "**I am Verin Hyoki.**" He then heads into the ship to find his quarters and stow his gear.
After he gets his stuff put away he finds a quiet, or at least moderately quiet, spot to sit and meditate for a while. He still wanted to think about what Master Pash had been telling them earlier. As he meditates he pulls out the training aid that James had given him and he uses the force to manipulate it as he meditates.
*I wonder where we are stopping.*

Cera listens with interest as the two masters discuss their future. She can’t help the sudden thrill upon hearing her group was being transferred to Ossus. *At last* The thought flutters through her consciousness before she closes her eyes and clears it. Her thoughts are distracted as Master Zessek dismisses them and Master Pash takes Will’s sister aside. Watching them for a moment, she notices the girl’s distress. She frowns as she reminds herself it wasn't any of her business.
Closing her eyes she spends the next hour or so in meditation, contemplating Pash’s words to stay in the now. An act made difficult by the quickly passing time of her meditation. Gathering up the small satchel she scrambles to pack the few belongings she has, mostly clothes, as the satchel already is packed with the few precious mementos she brought with her to Coruscant. Rushing to the hanger bay, each step fills her with excitement at the prospect of what would await her on Ossus. Surely they wouldn’t go through the trouble of transporting them to Ossus just to send them away? She gives those she comes across in the hallway a polite nod, not letting them distract her from where she's going.
Finding the others have already started to gather at the ramp of their shuttle, she takes a final look around. Her focus comes to land on the other hopeful and she returns his bow, if a bit more formally from habit. “**Cera Pell**,” with a cock of her head she adds. “**I haven’t seen you around here before.**” She leaves the question unasked, leaving it up to the other hopeful to provide details. Adjusting the pack over her shoulder she begins to board the shuttle in step with Tal.

### **Yogi** (2013-03-12 10:09:11)

Will stood with the others at the transport. He took in one last glance of the place he called home for almost seven years. It really had become his home since he and Ed were orphaned. It was made even better when Ed found her way here to be with him. Only the Force could know how he managed to do it. She didn't really like to tell him how she came across her credits but he was smart enough to know that not everything she did was strictly legal.
Feeling a slight tugging at his sleeve brought a slight smile to his face. He didn't have to look to know that it was Ed who was doing the tugging. **"I'm coming Ed, I'm coming. Just taking a last look around before leaving. Who knows when we'll be back."** He looked her over noticing that she had all her belongings. With a calming breath he smiled at her. **"Ready to go?"**
Before walking up the ramp another padawan, who had been waiting, introduced himself to their group. Will gives the Tal a nod as he extends his hand. **"Will Davion"** He didn't get the chance to say much more before Master Zessek started barking orders to get aboard. He looked back to Ed. **"Lets get going and stow our gear."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-12 13:49:52)

Ed nodded her head, pausing a moment as she eyed the new padawan, get a room first, then think about being some form of social. "Ready." she said, glancing back at the temple before turning towards their new 'home' for the next few whenever. Heading up the ramp she moved off to find a room that would suit them both, she knew Will liked the silence so he could meditate but she liked noise but...well...she could deal with silence for the time they were stuck on board. She glanced into the third room she came across that was empty "Will!" she called "this one." She moved inside to take a room around.

### **master_Tru** (2013-03-14 21:39:25)

Tal continues up the shuttle ramp with your group smiling as he responds to Cera`s question. " I was discovered by master Doven and his padawan two years ago. The war delayed us from reaching the temple until only recently, so much of my training was done in the field." Tal directs your group on a small tour, as he had arrived before your group. "The refresher is down that corridor. The common area is here, and to your right bunk rooms. The bunk room at the end is for master Zessek." Tal lets that statement drop as an obvious warning.
The interior is of modest decor with brown metal paneling on the walls and floor. The common room is little more then a small table to eat at and some comfortable seating arranged in a semi circle in the middle of the room. The four bunk rooms each with four bunks are also sparsely decorated.
As your group settles in master Zessek nods in your general direction and heads for his bunk stating, " We have a rough day ahead of us in the morn. Rest up before you are broken in." With that his door closes and you are left alone with your team in the common room. With the protocal droid D0-DA piloting the shuttles course that leaves little for your group to do.
Later that night everyone except for Ed awakes with a sudden startle. A deep cold feeling creeps into your bodies and mind, a feeling that no matter how hard you try you cannot shake.
From inside the J-1 shuttles cockpit you can see the planet Zorule surrounded by multiple imperial star destroyers. So many in fact that you loose count on the facing hemisphere of Zorule alone. Swarms of Predator class starfighters buzz about in a dizzying array of patrol patterns. Master Zessek enters the cockpit shortly after your group.
"You feel it don`t you .... its the dark side of the force and it is strong here." Master Zessek`s voice as gruff as always. "Be mindful of that dark, that cold. Know when to strike and when to evade but do either with conviction. Now quite your minds, your focus. When you are clouded you broadcast it, use it to hunt you they will it is the nature of the weak that is the dark side."
Breaking the unexpected lesson from master Zessek B0-BA politely interrupts. "Excuse me if you would but we are being hailed by the siege fleets flag ship. Would you like me to put it through master?"
"Oh I am sure I know what they have to say!" master Zessek blurts out. "Hey where is that girl ..... Ed?" Pointing at Ed master Zessek continues " I have a job for you. Hack the mainframe and disengage the hyper drive safety protocols."
B0-BA still unsure of master Zessek`s direction repeats its inquiry. "The incoming hail master shall I put it through? They are being very insistent."
Annoyed master Zessek replies "Go ahead, maybe it will buy us some time."
A monotone male voice comes over the ships internal communications as B0-BA opens the channel. "This is the imperial ship Oppressor of the imperial navy, flag ship of sector 251st fleet. You are here by ordered to power down and prepare to be boarded." The hail ends abruptly leaving no chance for rebuttal.
"Well so much for buying us some time!" Master Zessek states before addressing your team. " Tal you pilot the ship, the rest of you ready yourselves in case my little gambet does not pay off." A weird smile strikes master Zessek`s features.
Tal takes the controls looking a little shaken master Zessek pats him on the back, an act that almost launches the young padawan from his seat. "You will do fine, word is that you are a fair pilot."

### **zerah** (2013-03-15 14:00:50)

Ed hadn't woken with the others, but she had started awake at the sound of Will leaving the room. Not that she got up right away, after all for all she knew he needed some water or...maybe couldn't sleep again. She'd walked passed Masters in the temple that didn't seem to ever sleep, just meditate. It was when he didn't come back that she finally decided to get up and see where he got lost to.
Finding everyone in the cockpit and imperial crusiers in their view was not the best thing to see when one was half asleep, and growing more awake by the minute, so she was a bit startled when the Jedi Master rounded on her and told her to hack their mainframe. She blinked at him slowly, brain catching up to the moment, he wanted her...to bypass the hyperdrive protocols...
"…Kay." she finally said for too long of silence of attempting to process the request, she was more awake now on the plus side as she headed for the mainframe in the ship; she couldn't help wondering though, was it a known thing that she could hack? did he just presume that since she could work on droids and the like that computers would be easy too? hell, did they know about her side jobs??
Calm down…work first, panic later.

### **Duggs** (2013-03-21 20:55:43)

He wakes up with a cold dread running through his body.
*What the hell is this?*
He gets up and makes his way to the cockpit. He sees all of the star destroyers that are surrounding the planet. He spends a few seconds looking around before Master Zessek gives them a lesson and explains that the feeling he has is the dark side of the force.
*It is very strong here.*
He works at clearing his mind so he can focus on the tasks at hand, though he can still feel the cold at the back of his mind.
*Clear your mind… Focus… Do not let the dark side distract you… Use it to tell where they are, but don't let them sense you…*
He moves back to his room and gathers his things so he is ready for what could be coming next. After he is ready he moves back to the common room to wait for what happens next.

### **Yogi** (2013-03-29 12:06:45)

Will stood in the cockpit with the others looking out to see an Imperial fleet. The number of capital ships present was so great it would be impossible to do a visual count. Add in the number of fighters and the scene was staggering. The whole time the cold dark feeling was rotting in his stomach. The presence here was strong. He had never felt that strong of a Dark Side presence before. It made him realize that he had so much more to learn.
As if on queue. Master Zessek walked in and confirmed his suspicion. He ran through the calming technique he had been taught to calm his mind and body in an attempt to follow the Masters instruction. He looked back to the planet and the fleet as Ed began to hack the ships computer as the Imperial flagship hailed them. There was no wondering on what was going to happen though it seemed that Master Zessek had a plan.
Still looking out at the fleet he spoke up. **"Master whats the plan?"** He said with a calmness that surprised even himself.

### **master_Tru** (2013-04-04 07:06:03)

Two squads of Predator class star-fighters change direction and head towards your J-1 shuttle. Stating the obvious B0-BA states with some concern in his audio vocabulators "Master, we have incoming Predator class star-fighters closing on our position fast! .... we are surely doomed this time master." Master Zessek merely curls his upper lip in response.
Ed pulls her head out from under a console having completed her assigned task and fairly sure she was successful. Nodding her head to master Zessek and Tal indicating she is done with the bypass. Tal immediately begins to punch up the hyper-drive nav-computer at that acknowledgement.
At Will`s inquiry master Zessek motions to Tal for a response. Tal still working the controls answers in a low tone deep in reflection. "I was discovered here. This was ... is my home-world, and its about to be overrun by the empire." Tal pauses a moment while the nav-computer begins to register calculations and producing a series of beeps that could only be error warnings. "It was master Doven`s idea to try a micro hyper jump to bypass the imperial siege fleet .... though they had less ships .... and he did most of the piloting ... and we where going in the other direction ...." Tal looks up and smiles. "This will work, I`m sure of it ... it has to." The later part was said under his breath but still heard by all.
The Predator class star-fighters close in some taking a wide arc to encircle your shuttle. A female voice breaks the silence over the ships communications. "this is Bravo leader, here to escort you to the Oppressor. Please stand down and enjoy the ride." Her friendly tone under the circumstances comes out as very sarcastic.
Tal shouts out in the excitement "She is ready master Zessek!"
"Then punch it, and may the force be with us." Replies master Zessek.
As if anticipating your excedus plan, or simply reading the power build up in your ships hyper drive the squad of Predator class star-fighters open fire. In a brilliant stream of laser fire and star`s everything blurs across the view port for just a split second, then in a blink of an eye Zorule looms ahead of you filling the entire view port. Various warning alarms blast away drowning the cockpit with their annoying sound. Sweat beads off Tal`s brow as he works furiously to keep the shuttle under control.
In his usual gruff voice master Zessek barks "See told you we would make it. Now team report to the cargo hold we have supplies to drop off!"

---

### **Duggs** (2013-04-07 00:00:35)

He sits in the common room gathering his thoughts.
*What is Master Zessek's plan? We can not fight off that many ships.*
He feels the ship lunge as it hits warp speed for a split second. He starts to move for the bridge to see what is going on.
*That didn't feel right.*
He enters the bridge and takes a quick look around as all of the alarms are going off, and all he can see is the planet Zorule.
"**Well, this is not what I expected at all.**"
Master Zessek tells them all to report to the cargo hold so he turns back around and heads to the cargo hold. As he heads that way and looks around at the others.
"**Did we go to warp speed that close to all of those ships and towards a planet?**"

---

### **zerah** (2013-04-08 09:40:50)

Ed shifted to the side and away from the controls and Tal, computers were her forte, piloting? not so much and she did not want to touch something that would screw up any of her quick fixes underneath. She watched though, nervous on if it would hold, if she hadn't mixed up a wire - don't be stupid Ed you know you didn't - if Tal could even fly the damn thing.
It was with a lurch and stream of stars and blaster fire that they left one spot and appeared in the next closer to the planet, only then did she release the breath she didn't know she had held and smirked at her brother, nudging him lightly as she headed for the cargo hold. Why had she even doubted herself, honestly, she knew better than that.
"Yup." she answered Hyoki, grinning like a loon, it was exciting! what a way to start a new life! "exciting isn't it?"

---

### **Duggs** (2013-04-08 15:02:29)

He took a second to think about Ed's reply.
"**It is exciting, but I am amazed Tal could get us warp us like that. Of course, I know you had a hand in it too.**"
He finishes his sentence looking at Ed.
Once he gets to the cargo hold he stands with the others waiting for what they are to do next. He does some small meditation thinking on what has happened so far, and what Master Zessek had told them earlier.

---

### **zerah** (2013-04-14 10:13:53)

Ed just smirks and crosses her arms, waiting for the next orders "Naturally, you think he could get us to jump like that without a bit of help?" so she was smug, so sue her, she had just hacked their systems and allowed them to jump past Imperial ships. She was entitled to a bit smugness...besides, it's not like anyone else on the damn ship knew how to do it, hacking and droids and computers were all she had to make her special here.

### **Alicia** (2013-04-14 21:54:05)

Cera had woken from what she thought was a nightmare, only to have found the feelings she thought resonated from the dream were from her waking reality. Shivering in the ominous waves, she makes her way to the cockpit to see what was happening. The young woman knows very well that she has little to offer any spacefaring effort, her skills with machines being negligible and her skill with illusions were hardly adequate for the scale necessary in space.
With this in mind, she found a place out of the way, but her curiosity in the events kept her from leaving the cramped space. Gripping the nearest bulkhead, she closes her eyes as the disorientation from the microjump clouds her senses for the brief moment. The planet filling the viewscreen greets her as she opens her eyes, and she backs out into the corridor with Master Zessek’s order.
With little in the way to collect, Cera makes her way to the cargo hold with the others.
“**You’re very skilled with machines, Ed.**” Cera compliments the younger girl.

---

### **Yogi** (2013-04-18 12:23:48)

Will smiled as the ship performed the microjump to the planet effectively jumping past the blockading fleet virtually unharmed. The slight unbalance from the microjump only lasted for a moment but long enough to place a hand on a bulkhead in the cockpit. "Nice work you two." He gave Ed a wink as he followed orders and headed to the cargo bay.
Hearing the surprised question about the jump and answer from Ed he nodded in agreement. A question entered his mind though. "Yeah exciting. Lets just hope that Master Zessek has another plan for us to get off the planet. Otherwise we'll be spending a lot of time here." Finished talking Will increased his pace to the cargo hold to prepare the cargo for delivery. He had a gut feeling that this might be a rather quick delivery.

---

### **Duggs** (2013-04-18 18:00:32)

He looks at Will after he speaks the question on his mind. "**Trust in Master Zessek and the Force. They will guide us safely to our destination.**" As he speaks he has his puzzle floating in front of him as he moves the pieces around and solves it and puts it back together in its many ways. He has had it long enough that solving it has become very easy for him, but in times of meditation he finds that it still helps him clear his mind.

### **master_Tru** (2013-05-05 08:39:23)

your J-1 shuttle begins to break through the planets atmosphere with a slight jolt. Tal works the controls frantically trying to maintain distance from the pursuing Predator fighters, while also trying not to burn up on atmospheric entry.
It`s night side on Zorule, across the sky flashes splay a light show of green and red beautiful yet horrific in origin. Throughout the planet various large scale and small scale battles wage for control. "This might get a little bumpy guys, better brace yourselves!" Despite Tal`s claim the decent goes very smoothly, having the ship land near a large rocky outcropping just outside a sprawling city.
You notice that much of the smaller fire fights are contained to the city limits while the large orbital bombardments are targeting remote regions, sparsely populated. It would seem that the empire is looking to subjugate this planet with minimal damage to its resources.
Forming a semi circle around your ship are several Galactic Alliance soldiers drawing fire from approaching imperial troopers. Scattered around the landing zone are various ships haphazardly parked, all loading passengers for evacuation. Each ship is similarly protected by Galactic Alliance soldiers. The Galactic Alliance soldiers are fighting hard to keep the imperial troopers at bay, even a few light sabers are spotted within the chaos.
But the lines of imperial troops seem endless, two replace every single fallen trooper. As if matters where not already dire heavy imperial walkers can be seen in the distance. It will only be a matter of time before the brave men and women defending the landing zone are completely overrun.
Like rain on a roof top the sound of blaster fire can be heard against the shuttles hull. though the would do little damage to the armored plating master Zessek bellows out orders. "Alright kids time to move and be quick about it! Keep the area clear long enough for the labor droids to unload the cargo."
Then with a burst of speed uncharacteristic of master Zessek`s sheer size the jedi master charges the closest group of imperial soldiers. With no less the four light saber blades master Zessek wreaks havoc within the enemy lines. Tal steps off the boarding ramp first takes a questionable look around the follows after master Zessek igniting his blue light saber as he goes.
Labor droids float into the ships hold and begin to unload the relief supplies. To the right sid eof the shuttle four Galactic Alliance soldiers fight behind make shift barricades spaced two meters apart. One of the four falls to blaster fire while a group of six imperial troopers charge the defenses.

### **zerah** (2013-05-05 09:32:32)

Ed watched the large Jedi Master take off like a shot, his apprentice following after and leaving them to...do what exactly? guard the droids? this was a plan!? How was this a plan?? They had sabers at least and had been training with them! she had...what a screwdriver?? How was this a plan!? she didn't have a blaster and none of them were exactly ready to take on Imperials!
An alliance fighter fell, imperials advanced, and Ed wondered if that was some sort of sight or something. Well...crap, she couldn't complain much now could she.
She broke from the others, making a running dash to the fallen member of galactic peace, she just needed to grab the blaster and than shoot. And not shoot herself or someone on her side.
When this was over she was going to need to have a chat with the adults, this..this was not in any way a plan. fun and dangerous, not a plan.

---

### **Duggs** (2013-05-05 12:00:06)

He watches as Master Zessek and Tal run of into a group of imperials and start fighting to help protect the galactic alliance troops.
*Keep the area clear… The force will guide you…*
He watches as a galactic soldier falls, and he sees imperial troops charging the barricade where he soldier fell. Ed makes a run for the barricade and he runs right behind her. As Ed picks up the soldiers rifle he places his hands on the dropped soldier and lets the force flow through him and into the soldier.
*You can heal him… You must heal him…*
After he attempts to heal the soldier he gets ready to defend himself and the barricade, but he never pulls his lightsaber.
