OK game on:

A short intro to start things off, at this point you should all add a description of your character with your responses to master Pash, this includes you Z (though you do not have to recite the jedi code). Add details as you feel necessary to aid in the telling of this story, remember though I am the GM we are all telling this story we are all a part of this adventure.

I just got my full sheet up. Fairly sure the math is right. I'll double check it tonight once I'm home from work and at my computer.
Can't wait to be getting started!

Just as a technical question Tru, I went to visit the [Wookie](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jedi_Code "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jedi_Code")since I had forgotten the order of the lines in the Jedi Code, and I realized that the Code seems to have been modified by Luke from the original Code I had learned from the KOTOR games. So just not to make a fool of myself, which Code are we supposed to recite? <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

The code that the current jedi order would preach would be the revised Luke version. As to which code you are to recite .... that is up to you and the limits of your character.

### **Yogi** (2013-02-22 21:43:54)

Ok so what Jedi creed was supposed to be used?
It seems that there are two floating around. I looked for the one DA used couldn't find it.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2013-02-22 21:47:33)

I figured it was like you said Tru, but I was a bit surprised to learn that there were more than one Code, so I figured perhaps I was not the only one aware of that, and that you would have a "what the..."-moment if I used something completely new. Still, I used the old one, as it makes more sense for my character.
Yogi, the one you used is the one set down by master Skywalker, so it would logically be the one used by the New Jedi Order. The one I used is the original version of the Old Republic code.

Don´t think you made any spelling mistakes...not that my spellchecker could find anyway. Though you did seem to confuse Verin and Valen, and that I will put on you <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

So ... did anyone wasnt to do anything in the 2 hrs Zessek provided? Before I make my post.

---

### **Yogi** (2013-03-06 08:03:13)

I do. I've been getting killed at work along with being busy at home. I will put fingers to keyboard today when I have a chance here at work. I'm hoping during lunch.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-03-06 08:45:55)

Wasn't planning anything important so if I don't get to it today I can try to put it in my next post.

### **Yogi** (2013-03-19 12:20:34)

Yikes I've been busy. I'm trying to get a post going here at work. It's my 2nd daughters b-day today (shes 11. So for those keeping tally that makes 4 girls ages 12, 11, 9 , 7 <!-- s8/ -->![8/](https://i.ibb.co/kVxpy8vX/icon-eek.gif)<!-- s8/ --> ) Tonight will be filled with pizza and cake and a party at home for our family. If the post is not up before 5pm it might have to wait till later. As I'll be on a cake and ice cream high. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

Perhaps we should move on without DA and Alicia. I know even I took forever to post. This last week has been a week from hell. Last Sunday we discovered all 4 girls had head lice. <!-- s:/ -->![:/](https://i.ibb.co/1fht9Fjq/icon-mad.gif)<!-- s:/ --> Where they picked it up from who knows but what a crappy week. Cleaning and washing out the ying yang. And I've combed enough hair to last a lifetime. Thankfully I think we're past the worst of it as all hair has been clear for 3 days now.

### **master_Tru** (2013-04-01 06:28:05)

I was waiting for the Easter weekend before posting. I am off to work soon I will have my post up when I get home later tonight.

---

### **master_Tru** (2013-04-18 08:10:03)

I am curious as to the .... rate of posting or in fact the lack there of. Some of you are posting once a week and well I might add while others not so much. I do understand that life does get in the way, and if that is the case please let us know. From a GM stand point the lack of posting is a motivational downer to post myself. You may state that I as a GM may not have left my posts with ample roll playing opportunities, and I would completely agree with you on that point. In fact I have been very malicious on that intent. I have however left everyone with ample role playing opportunities, it is the role playing that makes that character and the story.
Anyway that is my rant for today, I look forward to your replies.
Cheers.

### **Yogi** (2013-04-18 12:27:29)

I have been busy Tru. Though with that said its not a very good excuse. I should have come in and said that was the case. I will make an effort to keep up better and post when you get a post up.

---

### **Duggs** (2013-04-18 17:55:30)

I have posted as often as I can, or I have waited for others to post. I have forgotten a time or two to come back after I see a new post, but I will try to get better at it.

---

### **master_Tru** (2013-04-20 21:31:36)

Work has been throwing overtime at me .... hoping to get my post up Mondayish

---

### **Alicia** (2013-04-23 16:32:27)

Work is going to be pretty hectic for me this week. More so than normal since one of our sales reps is out of town.
First weekend of May I'll be out of town but since I'll have Internet should be able to get some posts up.

The overtime must be killer. Hope all is well Tru.

### **Alicia** (2013-04-30 10:09:02)

I was actually thinking the same thing this morning.

My apologies for the tardiness of my post, I blame my greed <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->
Over the last few weeks I was offered a lot of overtime, needless to say 14 hour days 6 days a week leaves only room for sleep. Anyway GAME ON! <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

---

### **Yogi** (2013-05-06 18:38:27)

I hear ya Tru. When its offered up here I tend to jump at it also. I was away this past weekend at my dads. No internet there. Home now though. Yay I have internets back.

---

### **master_Tru** (2013-06-22 08:35:32)

I should have made this post a while ago, but I did not want it to come to this. I had been holding off hoping that this game would come through. Unfortunately due to several delays which seem to have plagued this game from the start I am thinking this game was over a while ago. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->
It sucks too as some of you had been doing a great job. Trust me when I say this is hard for me to do, but even if we give this another chance I fear it had more the enough chances already.
Sorry about the bad news, I do hope to see you guys in any future games I might get to play in or run.
Cheers

### **Alicia** (2013-06-22 16:36:01)

Sorry it came to this as well, Tru. I'll be seeing you around!

It sucks that it has come to this, but it is understandable.
