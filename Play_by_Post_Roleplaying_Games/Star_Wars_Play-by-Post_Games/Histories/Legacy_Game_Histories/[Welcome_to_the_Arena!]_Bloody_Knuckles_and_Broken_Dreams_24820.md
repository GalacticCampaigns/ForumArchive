# [Welcome to the Arena!] Bloody Knuckles and Broken Dreams

### **Magical2099** (2010-10-13 15:45:31)

Ozan Kaathuul finds himself in Arena number Three on Tier Six, standing before a protocol droid perusing the available matches.
Wookie Bowcaster 1500 credit purse
Whipid Medkit 1500 credit purse
Zeltron Blaster Pistol 1500 credit purse
As he stands pondering his soon to be opponent the droid asks, **"Sir, what will be your wager?"** its voice prim and cultured and out of place in the rough neighborhood he finds himself in. The crowds seem sparse this evening, or maybe they are currently packing the stands watching bouts. The suns went down roughly an hour ago, and the temperature is approaching bearable.
((OOC pick your opponent and roll your initiative, we use the board dice most of the time, its just below the italics button. Good luck and see the map thread for your location and please note it somewhere on your character sheet. Also, you may have done so already, but you may wanna look over the rules and regs thread. OOC))

A look of disappoint crosses Ozan's face. Looking at the list of opponents, Ozan didn't get a feeling of satisfaction when he imagned defeating them, beating them to a bloody pulp. He had wanted something more, but wasn't sure exactly what that was. Maybe he was hoping to see a Rancor listed or a Wampa. Maybe someth...then realization hit him. "I want a Cerean! A pointy headed, self-righteous...no." A large smile replaces the grimace on Private Kaathuul's face, images of Captain's rank and long periods of boredom flash through his head. Now speaking out loud, his voice is calm and even. "I want to kill Captain Eraan." His large smile replaced by a contented expression, he turns to the droid at the registration kiosk. " Ay droid. I wanna fight the Whipid and the Wookie. No guns, just what we have on our hands. An if they're scared, I'll drop my armor too." Waiting for a reply, Ozan realizes he is starting to get very excited. This will be his first real fight in over a month. No holds barred. No whinny, spineless, pricks to ruin his fun!

The droid looks at the listings and info on his terminal, the turns back Ozan, **"Sir, on this Tier you fight how you choose. If you choose no weapons you carry no weapons. Your opponent on the other hand, may well choose to carry whatever he likes. If it is any consolation, I believe the Whipid who is wagering a medkit uses only melee weapons. What would you like to wager against his medkit?"** the droid asks as he continues picking away at the keyboard of his terminal.

Ozan shrugs, a look of resignation on his face. Taking his rifle off his back and placing it on the table in front of the droid, he holds his hands out, displaying the Shockboxing gloves. "Well, which ever one of these you want. Oh, the Whipid will be fine." While waiting for the droid to decide on what was needed for the wager, Ozan thought about how he was going to take down his opponent. Thoughts of the physical nature of the beast and how he use them to his advantage, truned his thoughts to house hold pets. His thoughts made him smile slightly. "I wonder if I can get a large ball of string or a big laser pointer, maybe a baby Farghul?"

The droid scans the rifle and replies, **"This Arkanian rifle meets the minimum requirements. Please proceed to pit 7, last door on the right after entering the gladiator's area. Good luck."**
Easily finding the appropriate door Ozan enters to find a large Togorian wearing a shirt proclaiming NON-COMBATANT in yellow letters waiting for him. The massive feline mewls out a oft rehearsed speech: **"Through the door behind me you'll find a cage and a pit, when the cage opens, kill your opponent. Afterward, you'll be given a cash purse of 1500 credits and your opponents wagered Item,"** the practiced part done the Togorian's accent becomes more pronounced as he continues, **"Small being being careful, yes? Whipid large. Whipid fast. Whipid very strong,"** it says as it actually looks at Ozan for the first time. **"Sad, Whipid not stupid. Whipid will eat small being, no?"** it says with an odd grin as it opens the door and slaps the newcomer on the back.
Once in the cage speakers crackle around the Arena and the sparse crowd of late evening betters quiets as the announcer begins the match: **"COME ONE, COME ALL TO THE KILLEE-KOR ARENA!!! THIS HOUR FOR YOUR VIEWING PLEASURE WE HAVE A VICIOUS WHIPID HUNTER VERSUS AN ARMED, ARMORED, AND DANGEROUS ZYGERRIAN SOLDIER!!! MAY THE DEADLIEST WIN!!! BEGIN!!!"**
At the announcer's word the cages open and Ozan can see the massive hairy beast clutching several spears in one clawed hand as it rushes forward towards the lit fire in the middle of the pit.

Ozan's first instinct is to close with the Whipid as quick as possible, but discipline through military training prevents him from doing this. Instead, he moves along the wall, holding his rifle up at a ready position. Conflict between his aggressive nature and the training he has had starts a mild aching in the back of his head. Images of bloody fists and spears protruding through his chest clash into each other as he waits for the Whipid to make his next move.

As Ozan creeps forward, a spear sails through the flames to impact his armored chest like a powerhammer swung by a Wookie. His hand squeezes the triggering mechanism on his rifle reflexively just before the spear hits, and he is rewarded by an angry grunting, wuffing noise as he recovers from his injury. Ozan can see the shadow of his opponent as he moves to the other side of the fire. The crowd begins to waken and cheering can be heard as the massive beast bursts into flames.
((OOC
The whipid has cover from you, you don't have cover from him. I went ahead and had you shoot since he wasn't moving out of cover. As for FPing the fire attack roll, I don't think you can spend more than one in a round, and the fire hit anyway.

The sight of the burning Whipid did nothing to abate the anger Ozan felt over having a spear hit him. "That Bastard hit me with a CRINKIN' SPEAR!" YOU PRIMTIVE..AHHHGGGG! His roar of rage is barely controlled by the voice of his Combat Instructor echoing in his mind. "Unfocused rage will lead you to ruin Private Kaathul! Focus it and use it to DESTROY YOUR ENEMY!" Looking around quickly, Ozan develops a plan and puts it to action, his blood boiling from the anger within.

Ozan's shot flies wide through the flames of both the fire and the Whipid. The still burning Whipid moves, lumbering on the knuckles of one clawed hand and his short legs, until he has a clear run at his opponent. The beast roars and reverses its grip on its spear, holding it high over its head as it barrels towards Ozan with amazing speed for a creature so large. If the thrown spear felt like a power hammer this spear, with the weight of the beast behind it, feels like being hit with a starship at full thrust.

A burning ball of anger and teeth slam into Ozan with monstrous force. Surprised by the strength of the Whipid's attack, Ozan drops his rifle as he reels back slightly, every muscle fiber in him straining to keep him upright. For a split second, shock threatens to overcome him, but his own rage takes charge of his mind and body. Using muscle memory from years of monotenous training, he places his limbs and torso in a perfect position to focus all his recoiling energy on the face of the burning Whipid. Ozan's own face a contorted mask of pain and rage.

The crowd begins cheering whole heartedly as the burning Whipid charges, but they go completely insane after the beast falls, neck viciously broken by a bare-handed strike from his opponent. The noise is amazing, especially considering the not quite full stands.
**"WE HAVE A WINNER!!! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT FOLKS?!?!?!? THIS MAN JUST BROKE A WHIPID'S NECK!!! WITH ONE BLOW!!! GIVE HIM A HAND!!! LET'S FIND OUT WHO OUR NEWEST ADDITION IS!!!"** the announcer's voice booms out over the loudspeakers, managing to overpower the screaming crowd, but only barely.
Shortly, the Torgorian that let Ozan into the pit approaches with a credstick valued at 1500 credits and a backpack, which on closer inspection is label 'Ash-Corp Elite Medical Equipment.' The backpack is a medkit, with a surgical kit and 4 medpacs packed away in its storage pouches. After handing these over the massive furry creature slaps Ozan on the back, and pins a badge on his shoulder, denoting him as an Arena Gladiator. **"Small being did good! Small being not eaten! Congratulations! Here is winnings, here is badge. Badge grants access to Arena-Net. Neat stuff. State name, please,"** it shouts into his ear to be heard as it holds a small audio transmitter up to Ozan.

Ozan stumbles forward slightly, the Whipid's head gave easier than he thought it would. For a short moment the arena around him spins and the only sound he can hear is the roar of the crowd, which he mistakes for his own heart beat. A single voice thunders through his fogged mind, ... **"GIVE HIM A HAND!!! LET'S FIND OUT WHO OUR NEWEST ADDITION IS!!!"**
Straightening himself, the Zygerrian looks at the burning lump that used to be a Whipid, his vision clearing as he turns his attention to the approaching Torgorian. The smell of burning hair and flesh finally register with his brain and causes his stomach to churn, forcing a small portion of his breakfast to his mouth, this causes his stomach to churn harder, so he spits what's in his mouth on the burning pile of hair.
The Torgorian finally reaches Ozan and slaps a device of some kind on the spitting man's shoulder. **"Small being did good! Small being not eaten! Congratulations! Here is winnings, here is badge. Badge grants access to Arena-Net. Neat stuff. State name, please."** Taking the bag labeled 'Ash-Corp Elite Medical Equipment', he begins to offer the crowd his name, then the voice of his squad mate Hoxler enters from the back of his skull, ***"At least try NOT to look like you just fell off a military recruiting poster. Changing your name might help a bit too."*** Smiling widely he gives a name he will regret using, it's just not cool enough for an arena fighter. At this moment though the name seems hilarious. **"Hox!"** screaming more at the Torgorian than at the small audio transmitter. **"HOX THE REBUKER!"**

**"THERE YOU HAVE IT, GOOD PEOPLE OF KILLEE-KOR!!! HOX THE REBUKER!!! CONGRATULATIONS HOX, AND GOOD LUCK IN THE FUTURE!!!"** the announcer booms before the speakers die. The roaring of the crowd hasn't diminished as Ozan exits the Arena with his prize, finding himself shortly back before the same droid that granted him access to the Arena.
**"Congratulations sir. Would you be interested in an Arena-Pad? The device allows remote access to the Arena-Net, a very useful resource,"** the droid asks. The crowds out in the lobby area are scarce, and Ozan can hear an amazing amount of roaring coming from deep inside the Arena.

A stray thought enters Ozan's swirling head as he hears the crowd roar and looks back at the door he just came out of. *"Must be a big name in there. Wonder if I'll get to fight 'im?"* His eyes focus again on the droid in front of him. "Whu..Arena-Pad, wha's that, wha's the Arena-Net?" His mind clears for a moment as pain from the wound inflicted by the deceased Whipid screams at him for attention. Ignoring the droid again as it attempts to answer his question, the wounded Zygerrian looks at the hole in his armor and begins to probe deeply inside the newly bleeding wound. A threatening taste of vomit brings Ozan's attention back to the droid and the words that are flowing out of it's vocabulator. "Ne'ermin, jus tell me where ta fix this hole. I'll worry about the neat stuff an useful r'sorce later." His voice is firmly directed at the droid as he stares at the large splinter he just pulled out of his last wound. "I need a Doc." His mind swirls again as he tries to focus on the droid.

**"As you wish,"** the droid replies as it accesses the information on its terminal. **"Goodo's Hospital and Supply has an office one block over,"** the droid says as it points the way.
It takes Ozan less than five minutes to make it to Goodo's Hospital and Supply, and along the way he notices that the crowds don't seem to pay much mind to his wounded state, injured gladiators being a common sight. Goodo's Hospital and Supply is a gaudy shop advertising healing and all manner of other goods under one roof. Inside he is greeted by what appears to be a massive pawn shop/triage center, and a haggard looking Twi'lek walks up in a uniform displaying "Goodo's Hospital and Supply" in large letters and an illegible name tag.
**"What you shopping for? Meds? Drugs? Weapons? Or you looking to sell?"** she asks.

Ozan takes a brief second to look at the female's personal assets before he looks around for a place to sit and tells her what he needs. "Hmm, wellU'm lookin' for somun who ca'fix the holes i'my ches' basally. An if there's anthin worh buyin' af'er I'm patched up, we cu'talk." Absently poking at the wounds with his finger, he eyes the haggard Twilek again while taking a deep breath and shaking his head slightly. "Maybe we can work a deal." Working up his best smile, he leans back against whatever he happens to be sitting on.

**"Riiiight. Maybe after you're done bleeding all over my floor you can try again, eh?"** she says with a roll of her eyes. **"Come this way."** She leads Ozan towards the triage area and seats him, and after a five minute wait a Gand approaches in the same uniform but with more blood and passes several scanners and imaging devices over him, then leaves without a word. Another five minutes pass and the Twi'lek returns with a datapad, stating, **"Full combat readiness will cost you three hundred and fifty credits and a night's sleep. Sign here, here, here, initial here, and sign again here."**

### **Anonymous** (2010-11-17 02:16:27)

Taking the data pad and signing where told to, Ozan relaxes on the table. Sitting down seemed to help considerably, his thoughts were coming to him clearer and his mouth was working with his brain again.**"Rest? Okay. Where can I get a room?"** He thought about trying another smile and a witty comment, but thought better of it and decided resolving where he was going to stay tonight was probably a good idea . **"I have enough money to rent a room from you if you have one. I also have this surgical kit I'd be willing to trade for a place to stay."**

**"We don't have rooms here, but just round the block is our affiliate, Goodo's Hotel and Supply. Rates are decent. As for the kit…"** she drifts off as she looks through it, **"I can offer you fifteen hundred credits and the cost of your treatment for it. That's a value of 1850 credits, you won't get a better deal."** Finished with her offer she punches a few commands into the pad and a droid approaches pushing a medical bed. Once it arrives it gestures to the bed and lifts a familiar looking syringe. Ozan recognizes it from his drills in the military as a field anesthetic, an incredibly strong pain killer. The Twi'lek female helps him stand while waiting for his response.

"Sounds good Doc, It's a deal." Indicating the needle infront of him, he asks one last question before settling back on the Med bed. "Can I get a few of those for the road? Might come in handy for my celebration party later." Smiling to her as he lays down, he gives his charm another chance to work for him. "Your welcome to join me of course."

As the Twi'lek female waves the droid forward it injects the cocktail into Ozan, and she says, **"Ya know, even for a fella who's bleeding all over my floor you're persistent. Dedicated too, or really stupid. For my ego though I'm going with dedicated,"** she says with a wide grin as Ozan's vision quickly blurs to nothing.
Not quite an hour later he wakes on the same table alone in the corner of the temporary walled section that offers the little privacy to be had here at Goodo's Hospital and Supply. As he stands the Gand who had diagnosed him comes into his alcove, hands him a credchip with 1500 credits on the readout and a receipt for services rendered in the value of 350, all of which in exchange for the now missing deluxe Medkit. Feeling just shy of wonderful, he stands as the Gand leaves.

Dreams of combat and sweaty Twi'lek females flash through Ozan's mind, all of it arousing. A deep contented sigh leaves the Zygerrian's mouth as his eyes open and he takes in his surroundings, looking for his gear. He sits up then moves off the bed to gather up his equipment, trying to remember where the Twi'lek said he could get a room and some additional equipment, just then the Gand from earlier enters the room. "Hey bud, which way's that other Goodo's place your boss was talkin about? And a good place to eat too." With nothing to carry his gear in, the now refreshed Gladiator pulls on his armor and remaining equipment while waiting for the Gand to answer, mentally checking his inventory to make sure he wasn't robbed.

### **Magical2099** (2010-11-27 08:56:05)

Ozan finds everything as he left it, even the armor's still fresh scarring. In response to his question the Gand twitters at him in what he assumes is Gand, then scribbles on the back of the receipt flimsy the words 'left out that door' as he points towards an exit on the opposite side from the one that Ozan entered. As he crosses the building towards the door Ozan spots the sale tables between him and the door. All manner of goods adorn the tables, requiring only some time and tolerance for the slimy looking Devaronian male in the *Goodo's* uniform who lingers there. This area is no where near as busy as the triage area, and the Devaronian looks both bored and anxious all at once.

Thanking the Gand with a slight nod and a partial smile, Ozan moves through the hospital, towards the indicated exit. Slowing his walking pace slightly as he passes the Devaronian, Ozan glances over the items which seem to be for sale. He also takes note of any signs which might be advertising discounts as he'll probably come back later for a more thorough look. His main goal at this moment was to find a place to stay and somewhere to eat. The last thing he remembers eating is the breakfast ration he had when he landed this morning. The vague directions given by the Gand were enough to get Ozan to the front of Godo's Hotel and Supply, literally out the door and to the left, just a few blocks. As he entered the building, Ozan wondered to himself if he should call his shipmates and see if they were still on the planet, maybe he could get them to buy him a drink to celebrate his win.

The only thing on the tables that truly jumps out as rare or unique is a suit of heavy armor with equally heavy damage. Its price is low, but its condition makes it unwearable. The only sign he sees is a notice of swiftly changing inventory, so customers should 'Buy now! Buy now, before its gone forever!!!'
As he enters Goodo's Hotel and Supply he finds the front desk staffed by a Trandoshan female, who welcomes him with barely accented Basic, a very light lisp, **"Welcome to Goodo's Hotel and Supply. A night's rental is 130 credits, which includes two meals and access to the Supply Hall on the left where you can shop our inventory, and our Pleasure Hall on the right, where you can enjoy your hard earned winnings. You can rent a sleep station for a standard week (5 days) for five hundred, which comes with two meals per day and access to our Halls. Our rooms are more expensive, naturally, at 175 a night or 700 per standard week. Which would you like?"** as she speaks she gestures to the right and left, where Ozan sees a hall full of stalls packed with all manner of gear; on the opposite side he catches glimpses of scantily clad females and males through the curtains that serve as a door.
