# [Star Wars Legacy] Chapter Two

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-22 06:51:50)

After a long week of hyper space your crew jumps into the Kash system. Bored restless and in need of a little more space you a both excited and disappointed by the view of Sarlacc Station.
Sarlacc Station sitting at the edge of a one star one planet system one would wonder whats out her for a space station. The station itself more a jumble of derelict ships and cargo pods.This lose assembly of star ships broken hulls and durasteel surprisingly bolsters a fair amount of traffic. The station sits in disrepair electrical discharges, mynocks and dura rot plague its surface. Rogue comets pass the very outer edge of the system.
As your ship limps closer an airlock opens on the station, a lone body is released. The poor soul turns end over end and you notice the lack of any kind of space suit on the body.
The traffic around Sarlacc Station accommodates ships of all sizes makes and models. Most in various degrees of disrepair complimenting the station itself. Tinian try`s to raise the docking officials but only gets an automatic response in return "Landing bay or Port dock?" Tinian thinking the ship might not take off again if landed chooses the Port docking.
The Biddy Crate is eased into port docking the clamps close down finishing the hard lock and a tubular bridge extends to the ship. All clear the escape hatch doors open the corridor is empty further down a set of doors gives access to the station itself.
Cracking her knuckles again "OK we need a few parts for the landing assembly and the main hyper drive I will stay behind watch the ship and see what repairs I can continue. Oh and watch your selves out there if there was ever a place filled with scum and villainy this is it."

Turning a level gaze on Tinian, Kalaria arches an eyebrow at the woman. "My! Whatever gave you a clue about that?" she drawls with much sarcasm dripping from her voice. "Was it the poof sap that was shoved out the airlock? Or maybe it is the fact that this place is in worse repair than if we'd let the Last Hope go for a good seven years?"
Straightening, Kali sighs, and grabs her datapad. "And gee, I didn't know we needed parts for the Biddy Crate. Lacys better be grateful," she grumbles, though the comment lacks a certain amount of flare and anger. Certainly Kali's been keeping herself rather busy the last week, for the most part keeping to herself. But everyone once in a while, someone might well notice that the young woman has actively been trying to douse her anger.
A glance is given to Alishai, and Kalaria just shakes her head with her lips turned down in a frown since looking away from Tinian, before slipping her gaze to Thandrim. "Come on. You better come with me before you go and say something cheerful and get us all in trouble," she notes with a shrug before turning to head for the exit. "Maybe if I did repair work in exchange for parts, we could get out of here with a few things we still own."

'And here I thought Mos Eisley was the datafile definition.' Alishai comments, rising from her seat.
'Well, I'm probably the next most mechanically minded after Kali so I expect I should come along and make myself useful.' She says, heading toward the hatch. Pausing, she calls over her shoulder:
'Anazider, you're supposed to be a talker. Get your rear in gear.'
If she notices Kali's glance, she fails to express or comment to that effect.

### **Thandrim** (2008-03-05 12:09:07)

Having been in the cockpit with the others watching the approach to the station, Thandrim has observed in general silence. Until the docking is complete and the combination of Tinian and Kalaria's voices bring him forward a little in the social sense.
"That individual had probably already died. I would doubt these people have facilities for a proper space-born burial. It does not of course, remove the possibility that his death was... premature." There the young Jedi attempts to put some measure of ease into the equation without just making light of things. Folding arms before him, the boy moves to follow Kalaria while commenting in the same tones, "I will be necessary to leave here as soon as we can though. This being a Hutt controled station combined with the fact that we are being tracked gives us little time..."

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-05 12:14:13)

Garic who had been unusably quite the whole trip absentmindedly plays with an access panel before realizing the group is about ready. "I will stay behind it might be better to have two watching the ship in this place."

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **Anazider** (2008-03-05 13:00:21)

Anazider emerges from his bunk several moments after Alishai's call, cinching together the belt of his surcoat. His skin has a rosy hue, even as he wills it to its normal dusky olive complexion. The prince appears even more attractive than usual as he appears to glide towards the airlock.
"I see that our harrowing escape and time in hyperspace has done little to improve your manners."
A smirk slowly spreads across his lips, the expression somehow seeming both enticing and derisive. He turns briefly to Tinian.
"A question before we disembark: Where is it you intend to go next? I'd like to have an idea of our next destination before we go traipsing through this... cesspool."
Anazider looks to Tinian with a quirked eyebrow, awaiting the response.
((Meditated for an hour, Tru. Max Pheromonage!))

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-05 14:35:31)

As Garic makes it known that he's going to stay, Kalaria pauses, then turns and smiles at the Zabrak. Leaning forward, Kali gives the man a hug, tightly, quietly murmuring to him > before she gives the man sisterly and chaste kiss on the cheek.
"You be careful. Who knows what sort of taxes they'll try to forcibly collect from you while we're here. I plan on trying to make this as short as possible," she notes before casting a glance at Thandrim curiously, almost aprehensively, before striding out just in time to make room for Anazider.
((OOC: Not sure... but will use Deception if I can to hide what I said to Garic....))

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-06 14:38:01)

Returning Kali`s embrace "You take care in there, I want you all to come back!" Garic gives Kali a wink. "Now get going those parts wont come to us."
Tinian Lar looks to Anazider "My home world is Yomber, I am part of the voluntary defense force ..... and my family lives there." Tinian looks down before turning away for the ships corridor. "Its not too far from here should be a quick stop for your group."
Down the extended bridge is a set of doors with a simple open close clear not clear panel. The bridge itself has the upper half transparent giving you a view of space the station some local shipping traffic and a few station windows. Flashes of light can be seen from some of the windows but stop only after three flashes. Tinain disappears into the Biddy Crate probably to continue repairs, while Garic stands at the hatch to see you all off he gives a wave to your group.

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-08 14:10:42)

Heading for the station access hatch you find it unlocked. Inside is another inner hatch after a short two meter corridor. This hatch is unlocked as well, giving you access to the station.
The station interior is sparse in this first room more a loading zone for this access point. An older model labor droid stacks crates off to the right blank panels line the left wall and double doors lead out of this area. After a few minutes the double doors open and two individuals enter.
One a Human dressed in baggy brown pants and a yellow vest his bald scalp reflects some of the station lights, he is missing his right ear. The other a short Sulustan in red body armor his ears have piercing running up the lengths of his ears and he is continuously sucking on his lower lip. Both are armed with blaster pistols.
They stop just inside the doors to whisper to each other then walk towards your group with a deliberate pace. â€œAh welcome to Station Sarlacc." announces the human while the Sulustan snickers from behind the human.
"I am sure you are here to pay the docking tolls, a mere fee of one hundred credits will secure your porting privileges." The human stops just within arms reach of your group, the human stand with an outstretched hand.

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-08 17:10:29)

Kalaria ... will let Anazider pay the bills. She's not even certain she can access her meager credits on this station anyway. Instead she looks at the pair, and does her best to look very much like the greasy mechanic. She pulls out her datapad and punchings in a few things, politely saying hello to the labor droid, in binary, if she can manage it. Hey, it never hurts to be nice to the droids! They hear things that people don't.
Then Kali will try to access the Station's computer, if it's pretty secure, she'll try to slice it another time, not in front of this pair. Just trying to get a map, see what sort of information traffic there is, that sort of thing. Nothing fancy. She's just making sure they're in and out as quickly as possible without any problems, the Force willing.

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **Anazider** (2008-03-08 18:33:50)

Anazider strides down the loading ramp with his hands folded within the billowing sleeves of his overcoat. He affixes an imperious stare on the pair of toughs, as would an owl looking upon a pair of talking worms.
"...There's a decided lack of welcoming baskets and warm face towels. A shame, that." The prince clucks his tongue as he slightly shakes his head, the quip holding little mirth.
"Gentlemen, extortion is so beneath you. It would sully the good name of the owner of this establishment, and I *know* that he is not a man to have his name tarnished. Such activity tends to lead to... *unpleasant* consequences. Wouldn't you agree?"
Anazider says with shaded venom. Making note of the tightness of his grip on his blaster, and the way his eyes dart back and forth, the falleen nobleman stands with an implacable calm and a menacing glare, seeking to unnerve the men and force them to back down.
((Intimidation check on the leader, trying to get him to back down and/or flee.))

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-03-09 11:41:55)

Alishai stands behind Anazider with an air of calm - one might go as far as to describe her stance as quietly arrogant. Her blaster is displayed prominently on her hip, and the shades she wears no doubt strike a chord in the two thugs - after all, the pair of them both clearly understand the connection between appearance and role.
Whenever one of them glances in her direction, she offers them a measured smile.
((OOC: Aid another on Anazider's intimidate attempt))

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **Thandrim** (2008-03-10 18:22:16)

Quietly confident he has hidden the black box well aboard the ship, Thandrim steps after the others willing to let Alishai as well as Anazider be nice walls obscuring him from view. No need to give obvious details away unless he needs to, and with any luck Anazider's own unique talents will not only deal with these thugs in a good way, but provide a touch of cover and freedom for them to get what they need and withdraw again. Lacys is sure to be pleased when she sees her ship in far better repair.

---

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-11 07:53:16)

As Kali tries her hand at accessing the local computer system the first thing she notices is that there is no remote access, the second the local area network inside the loading zones is off.
The humans jaw drops at Anaziders words his eyes dart quickly over to Alishai " A ....a a a well I will have to .... Check that yea thatâ€™s it check that with the local port authorities." He elbows his Sulustan friend who only smirks at the situation. "Wwait right here um we will be right back with word on that." Both make a hasty exit from the loading bay, as they turn the corner you can her the Sulustan laughing at his friend "How was I suppose to ..." their conversation is cut off by the stations background.
At the loading bay exit the promenade opens up various merchants have temporary shops setup in the center of the large multi leveled area. Lifts give access to all three floors. Various races crowd the market floor some buying some selling many browsing. The nearby lights and sounds of a casino catch you eye as well a Toydarian floating around a series of droids most of which are programmed to repeat "Buy Me!, Buy Me!" over and over.
Across the circular promenade is a cantina like most others except for the sign above the door which reads "The crusty Mynock" the sign barley covers another sign which reads "Grumbo`s." Inside serving droids wheel about with food and drink. What draws your attention to this cantina is the serpent like Hutt cleaning tables and conversing with customers. Until now you had only heard stories of Hutts of lower stature, until now you had never believed the stories.
-----------------------------------------
Inside the Biddy Crate Tinian approaches Garic "I have good news that is really bad news." She drops a tool kit and a space suit at his feet. "I also have more bad news if you can believe that." She cracks her knuckles "The bomb Lacy told us about was not a bomb, thatâ€™s the good news. The bad news is itâ€™s a tracking device, Kursk will be hunting us." She pauses a moment "I would do it myself but space makes me disorientated, you have to go outside and remove the device. Oh and bring you blaster incase you can not remove it."

### **Anazider** (2008-03-12 02:15:49)

Anazider sneers at the back of the retreating human, his crystal blue eyes ablaze with a tightly reined fury.
"Vermin, preying on the unfortunate. Blaster probably was not even loaded. Let us finish this business before some other manner of idiocy stumbles upon us."
Drawing his surcoat more tightly about himself, Anazider wades more deeply into the bustling throng of the promenade, finding a sort of tranquility amidst the cacophony of the merchant quarter. He keeps a sharp eye out for Vash's shop, while making sure to keep enough awareness to not be further accosted during the trip.

---

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-12 10:01:57)

"Oh, it was probably loaded. Likely the only way he felt secure enough to try what he did," notes Kalaria with a frown. "What do you know, they're system is locked down," she says, before nodding good-bye to the droid and following the others.
As the group walks along, an eyebrow rises as Kali spots the hutt, but she says nothing, nor does she point it out. Instead she keeps going. "Vash's is supposed to be right over here," she says softly to the group nodding now to her datapad. "Thandrim, might I suggest not being quite so optimistic around here? That's gonna get us in trouble."

---

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **Rowen** (2008-03-13 00:10:53)

Garic eyes the suit and tool kit, then his gaze drifts up to Tinian. "There are more things than just space that can make you disoriented." He picks up the suit. Starts turning it over in his hands inspecting it before placing his blaster beside him. Then once fully satisfied steps into it and proceeds to pull it over his clothes. He looks up at Tinian. "Thankfully Zabraks are a little more well built than humans. We can withstand the vacuum of space longer." He starts to slip his arms through the sleeves. "I don't want to live through any more *accidents* however." The hint at distrust is clear in his words and he flashes her a roguish grin and reaches for his blaster to secure it.

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **Thandrim** (2008-03-13 12:09:58)

Meanwhile aboard the station, "A person in turmoil will continue to be in turmoil until something or someone happens to brighten their day." Thandrim's answer to Kalaria's suggestion comes as the youth stands a little more off from Anazider than before, hands clasped behind his back. "It does pay to avoid too much attention though, you are right. The more anonymous we are, the better off we will be." Not that he expects their band to honestly look anonymous what with their unique group makeup.

---

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-13 12:16:33)

Kalaria's gaze slides to Thandrim and the young woman shifts a bit do that she can easily throw her elbow at the young man's ribs. "You want to be anonymous here, look grumpy. You don't HAVE to BE grumpy, just look it." Glancing around, Kali makes her way past a maintenance droid and grins.
Reaching out, Kali swipes her hand along the droid and it comes back filthy. "Also," she notes to Thandrim in a reasonably calm voice before spinning on him, "You need to be dirty," and with that, she tries to wipe her hand down the man's face before turning away to head to Vash's shop, wiping the rest of the grime and dirt on her pants.

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-13 13:17:45)

Continuing through the middle level of the promenade Alishai Anazider Kali and Thandrim notice several things that set this market apart from many others, it also give reason to finish their business here quickly. On top of some old crates a few women of varying races dance while individuals in large coats sell narcotics. Many of the temporary merchants sell weapons of all kinds most used, some still have blood on them. As you pass the Toydarian selling droids Harasses your group:
"Come now buy a droid best on the station!" as he makes his claim one of the little labor droids he has makes a pop sound before slumping to the ground.
"Oh hehe that one never worked well .... I will even through him in at half price. No one has better prices then Telt ask anyone, ask Telt. That's me!"
The Toydarian continues to barter his wares to your group until the next individual comes close to his shop.
Within the casino "Credits Worth" a tall Munn watches over the machines like a hawk stopping only to look into a data pad. A series of battle droids serve as the casinos guards, and several patrons try their luck inside.
Inside the Crusty Mynock (Grumbos) patrons are sparse only a few Ithorians at one table a Bothan at another and a large Trandoshan with a pyramid of empty drinks at his table. You notice that Grumbo between talking to his customers spends a fair amount of time cleaning, with the exception of the Trandoshans table the cantina is very clean.
The two thugs can be seen buying drinks in an upper cantina Star Scape, where several other thugs in grey armor loiter. Passing a group of jawas who do not understand the meaning of personal boundaries you finally come across a station map. Half the display has been smashed but the half that is functional shows you the location of Vash Inc (in association with Xin`za Transports).
As Kali touches the maintenance droid and comments on it the droids stares at her for a moment then walks away continuing its duty's. It can be heard beeping away much more then before ("Nuff herding flesh bag").
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tinian gives a laugh at Garics remark its obvious she has something pressing on her mind. She seems very distracted but she assists Garic with the suit blushing a little when she zips the suit closed. Tinian closes the inner hatch and depressurizes before opening the outer hatch.
Garic finds himself alone is a sea of stars and shipping traffic. random debre floats about and though the suit slows your movement the built in magnetic boots keep you on the ship.
With some static the com opens in Garics suit its Tinian "I know it must be a sight out there but you have a job to do! I will monitor you from here help you when and where I can."

"Just point me in the direction of this thing I'm suppose to dislodge from the hull and leave the rest to me." He snaps. One **could** quickly get disoriented out here. *The trick is to look at the hull, five or so feet ahead of you,* He thinks to himself. *To stare out at the vastness of space was usually a beginners first mistake.* Even though he allowed himself the awe inspiring view of the heavens. How many times had he lost a friend to such beautiful depths. "Perhaps this is to be the day I join them." He mumbles.

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-13 20:32:26)

"Hey, guys, not to be alarmist or anything, but... isn't that ... guy that wanted to uh... find us here... a Trandoshan?" asks Kali as she looks over into Grumbo's cantina. Then she looks up as the two 'Good Will Welcome Commisioners' head into a higher end cantina up on another level. Kali narrows her eyes at that and considers.
With a quick movement, that may be unexpected by some, Kali grabs for Thandrim's wrist and giggles. Yes, she giggles! Then she starts trying to drag Thandrim at a light-hearted jog towards Vash's trying to act like ... well ... a teenager.
((OOC: Deception: I am not actually running because I have a bad feeling things are going to go bad rather quickly! Nope, I'm not! I'm just a teenaged girl having some fun! Yup! Honest!))

### **Anazider** (2008-03-13 22:27:11)

Anazider frowns darkly at the directory, giving the defunct map more attention than its worth. He makes as if to respond to Kalaria's comment about the Trandoshan, but his mouth clicks shut abruptly when the pair of teenagers go running off.
"We should find the parts we need elsewhere. If we continue onward to Vash's, things may become unnecessarily... *complicated.*"
The prince turns his attention on Alishai, staring intently down upon her.

---

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **Thandrim** (2008-03-14 01:27:48)

There is enough time to blink once before his face is smudged, and again just time for a blink looking down at his suddenly clasped wrist before Thandrim is all but yanked off his feet by Kalaria's sudden 'change' in attitude and the pair are headed off at an oddly cheerful gait. So much for all that about acting grumpy, he supposes as he attempts to keep pace. A little smirk works on his lips as they go.

---

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-03-14 05:27:56)

'Sorry Anazider,' Alishai responds, 'but I've got to keep an eye on those two. Browse around if you like though.'
The warrior follows along behind Kali and Thandrim at some distance and a relaxed pace - far enough away and with a such a lack of effort to catch up, in fact, that she appears for all the Galaxy not to be associated with the two teenagers.

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-14 07:41:02)

"Garic there are some feign readings off the rear thruster assembly. Also its hard to tell but something is hitting the hull I keep getting a reading on the scanners then it disappears almost as fast." Tinian says in a calm vice over Garics com. Garic makes slow progress to the thruster assembly, turning once to avoid a corpse floating by.
The ship has taken some damage from the hanger bay mostly carbon scoring and with the blasters used not much if any hull damage was due to that fight. Most of the hull damage was from another ship or ships cannon scoring can be found in a number of spots it looks like Lacy had a little adventure of her own before making it back to Hopes End.
Garics com coms back to life again forcing him away from thoughts of Lacy`s possible adventure "There ....there it is again if/when you find the tracking device you should check that out it could be damaging the ship."
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Trandoshan is not wearing armor like Kursk did so itâ€™s hard to tell if its the same Trandoshan or not. This Trandoshan has many scars and despite its current drunken state looks very capable of holding its own. Your suspicions are dismissed as a serving droid sets another tray of drinks at its table "Another round Carrsserk."
Two teens dancing through the promenade looking if on a shopping spree within a black market fringe station only draws more stares. Though it does give Alishai the look as the parental role, following after her children.
Another look at the promenade map read out shows the Vash Inc happens to be the only business on the whole station capable of repairing a star ship. Obviously this Serian Vash has made a very good deal for himself on the station.

### **Anazider** (2008-03-14 10:37:38)

Anazider watches the trio wind their way towards the parts shop, appearing uncharacteristically indecisive. After a long moment, the prince follows Alishai to the shop, shaking his head to himself.
"As you wish... Although I at least tried."

### **Rowen** (2008-03-15 21:10:48)

"Roger, I'm on my way to the tracking device now." He looks around while speaking, every nerve on end. "It's probably just some Mynock." He adds in a calm tone. The racing of his heart and the sweat on his forehead reveals what his controlled response does not. "I'll be back on board sooner than you want me to." With that said he quickens his pace.

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-17 17:03:45)

Rounding a corner, Kali releases Thandrim's hand to suddenly reach up and pull out her spikey tails when she thinks she's is obscured enough from sight. A glance at the young Jedi and Kali arches an eyebrow upwards curiously. Then she turns on her heel and keeps up the quick pace towards Vash's shop.
The young woman strides confidently into the 'store', her eyes already beginning to study the parts and pieces in view for anything useful, curious, or needed.

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-03-17 17:37:19)

Alishai continues to trail behind the youngsters at her relaxed pace. When they arrive at Vash's store and go inside, she looks around the immediate vicinity for something to occupy her time while they're within.

### **Thandrim** (2008-03-17 17:41:51)

Thandrim now lacks any sign of that smirk from before as Kalaria makes her 'entry' into Vash's shoppe. The young Jedi-in-hidding walk in behind the teenage girl with curiosity on his features, taking time to ponder this item and that as the group works their way further into the store. Head tilts are quite common for the youth just now.

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-17 18:11:34)

Most of the lower section of the station is dominated by Vash Inc. Though many wire housing sits exposed none of the light flicker the doors all work people in this section seam a little more at ease.
Inside the main entry way of Vash Inc is a bustling business signs hang the walls noting that its the only mechanics shop on station which are mocked by signs noting number one in service. Many droids take orders for repair schedules silver protocol droids all programed with female personalities.
In the rear of the room large windows over look a massive hanger bay. Various ships up to colossal in size sit undergoing repairs. Hovering repair droids and Vash Inc staff work away at the never ending line of ships, sparks fly from high and low on the ships as repairs progress. As you await some kind of service you notice several customers leave groaning about the wait time for repairs.
"I am human cyborg relations unit C6T9 at your service. As a representative of Vash Inc in association with Xin`za Transports here to meet all your star ship servicing needs." The silver droids gives a preprogrammed pause "How may I direct your order and what kind of maintenance may I schedule on your parties behalf?"
Beyond customers you see only droids taking order for Vash Inc no other representatives. The clientele also varies many are tough spacer types others roguish pirate types.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Garic makes good progress to the thruster assembly but finds no tracking device. Tinain is only able to say " You must be close the signal is barley registering but it has to be it, keep looking."
After a few passes Garics inborn senses pay off, or was it luck. Nearly tripping over it the circular device blends in well with the ships hull even mimicking some of the blaster score marks. Where ever Kursk gets his supplies he has spared no expense this is high end tech.
Not sure what to do from here Garic finds out that the tracker is magnetically sealed to the ships hull and will not budge by hand.

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **Rowen** (2008-03-17 20:14:35)

Swearing under his breath as he tries to remove the device Garic reaches for his blaster. "Looks like its magnetically sealed." He pauses and crouches lower to the device. "I'm going to attempt a glancing blow on a seam......or something." Its times like this that he curses the design of space helmets, so constricting to ones view. "Perhaps I can disarm the lock if I damage it enough."
He pauses again and reholsters the blaster. "Might not be a good idea." He mumbles to himself and reaches for his tool kit. "It might be difficult in this suit but maybe, just maybe, a bit of Kali's finesse rubbed off on me." He smiles at the thought of the energetic young woman. "Here goes nothing."

### **Anazider** (2008-03-17 21:49:56)

Anazider strides in just after the teenage couple, his crystal blue eyes surveying the crowded parts shop while his lips twist sourly. Frowning at the shops poor upkeep, the prince stands just behind Kalaria and Thandrim, looming above the both of them.
"I have need of a landing claw actuator for a Mon Calamarian light freighter, and a replacement hyperdrive motivator for the same make. What is the current turn around time for repair?"
The Falleen nobleman makes sure to keep a wary eye for any that might recognize him, or any other sign of danger, while awaiting the droid's response.

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-18 13:43:50)

"Just get the parts," murmurs Kalaria as she passes by the Faleen in a murmur, pausing to look at something, twisting it over in her hands a moment. "We don't have time to wait for the backlog here. Alishai says she can help, between the two of us, we'll manage something."
Then Kali moves deeper in the shop, looking into the docking bay where the repairs are happening for a moment, before turning and looking over bits and pieces that she can find with interest. Is she looking for anything in particular, no, not really. Anazider has said what they need. She's just trying to look keenly interested and busy.

Anazider looks down upon Kalaria as one would a child interrupting adult conversation, before returning his attention to the droid. He awaits the droids response, his reasoning for asking about the repair time running deeper than a desire to fix the Biddy Crate.

Thandrim merely continues to stroll through the shop, eyeing bits and bobs, things and stuff. A small cylinder is examined more closely a moment before it is left behind in favor of what appears to be a holo-vid display.

Since Vash's is rather bigger than Alishai was expecting she changes her plans and goes inside. Still, she keeps her distance from Anazider and the others, seeing no reason to interfere in his negotiations. It's enough that she's present, just in case.

Garic fumbles with his tool kit the space suit making the task much more difficult. After a slip with a hydro spanner Garic receives a jolt of a blue electrical discharge from the tracking device.
Tinians voice comes over the comm "Garic I don't know what you did up there but its broadcasting on all channels now ..... snap and its got range too. What ever your doing up there down there .... ah space always throws me off, you had better deal with it soon. I don`t think the local traffic would like us broadcasting this position to half the galaxy and I don`t want to be here when someone comes to answer the beacon."
The tracking device is round blends into the hull of the ship, and now it is flashing a little red light in its center. Obviously trapped the tracking device has set to broadcast into space.
(5 hit points damage from the electrical discharge to Garic)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The silver droid pauses at Anaziders request then continues after checking inventory on its data pad. "Ah the Biddy Crate docked at the lower green deck. We have a large assortment of parts and accessories including the parts requested. Much of our merchandise is refurbished though we do have several suppliers of new stock. Brand new a landing claw actuator will cost 2000 credits though a refurbished unit is only 500credits. I am afraid a hyper drive motivator will cost a little more, new we are selling units at 5500 credits though we have recently come across several refurbished units as well costing only 1700 credits."
The droid gives a programed pause to allow its customers time to consider its response. "Of course all our new units come with a thirty day guarantee provided on of our technicians installs it. We also have a ten day warranty on all refurbished units providing a representative of Vash Inc installs the unit."
Once again the droid gives its programed pause before continuing "Who may I make this order out too and what will be the method of payment?"
Thandrims browsing has not gone unnoticed a burly Yuzzem stops to face the young human "^&%* *^&@^% &*$#!" His native language unknown to your entire group.
On seeing the confused looks on your faces a well dressed Twiâ€™lek male steps between the young human and the rather large Yuzzem motioning his hands to the door the Twiâ€™lek says "Leave your troubles at the door this is not the place for that ..... do I need to involve Miat?" At the mention of Miat the Yuzzem puts its head down and leaves.
Turning to the group the Twiâ€™lek smiles and shakes your hands "Please accept my apologies for that little mishap, I am ...." His voice trails off when he see`s Kali and Alishai. He gives a bow to the two " I am Serian Vash welcome to my humble establishment. What you I owe the pleasure of meeting the two of you?"

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-19 14:50:27)

Oh, look, a Twi'lek! Goodie. Kalaria pretty much keeps on browsing, finding some little widget that intrigues her momentarily. It takes several moments for the young woman to even begin to realize the Twi'lek was actually looking in her direction. Eyes blink and the young woman looks around a moment, from Alishai, to Thandrim, and quickly to Anazider. Then she looks back to the Twi'lek a moment, and reaches up to run a hand through her hair nervously.
Uh... a little help here?

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-03-19 16:51:36)

Alishai, having deliberately distanced herself from her companions and apparently in the process of studying the ships undergoing repair through the transparisteel windows at the rear, doesn't even hear the Twi'lek's greetings. Apparently she doesn't even notice the reflection in the window of him bowing in her direction, so intent is she on the work going on below.

### **Anazider** (2008-03-20 14:14:01)

Anazider maintains a calm countenance, although internally he is fuming over the Twi'lek's disrespect. He leans forward, interposing himself between Kalaria and the man.
"Perhaps you would be better served in addressing *me*, Vash, as *I* will be the one paying you. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to discuss the price of the parts I've requested. A much more profitable endeavor than oggling my female companions, wouldn't you agree?"
The prince stands would a silvered-eyebrow quirked, expecting a conforming answer to his question.

Garic inhales sharply as the blue discharge from the device travels up his arm. Swearing in his native language he gathers himself again. "Damn thing doesn't like what I'm doing apparently. I'll try again." He readies his tools. "If this doesn't work Ill try blasting it."
((OOC: If he fails to remove it with his tools he will blast the device at an angle that would do little to no damage to the ship itself.))

Blinks and a rather blank stare is what greets the rather large alien who directly questions Thandrim, the youth starting to slightly tilt his head before the Twi'lek takes care of whatever might have come next. The curious human does not move from his current location, but does bring attention to the alien who is apparently 'Vash' himself. That tiny smirk appearing again as the alien makes his specifically pleasant greeting to both Alishai and Kalaria. Interesting. Unconsciously an arm is brought upward to wipe at some of the muck Kalaria previously smattered over his face.

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-21 14:43:32)

Garic makes another attempt to remove the tracking device only to be repaid again with another jolt of electricity. Tinain`s voice comes over the com again "You ok Garic cause if you are stop playing around and shoot it, or something. Some other ships are powering up and heading our way this doesn`t look good. If they are hiding out here they well blow us up to stop the broadcast. Garic just shoot it!"
Off in the distance two transports are indeed heading this way. Both are well armed by the looks of things even from Garic veiw he can see gun emplacements.
((six more HP from the electrical shock Garic ))

With Alishia`s attention else where Serian pays more attention to Kali now. "Ah new to these parts I see I could show you all the sights of the station. I would consider it a personal honor."
Anaziders comment breaks into Serian`s conversation with Kali. But the Twi`lek smiles and turns to Anazider "Where are my manners?" Politely he bows to the noble then looks back to Kali " But one could not blame me of course."
Serian motions for C6T9 who responds "Yes master how may I be of service?"
"Clear your schedule make sure my guests here are treated properly." Turning back to your group he asks "Have you living arrangements yet and how long will you be on station?"

### **chibiamy** (2008-03-21 14:54:09)

Kali is very much thrown off guard by the fact the Twi'lek man keeps talking to her! The young woman reaches up to run a hand through her unbound hair, before looking at Anazider, then looking back to Serian. She stares for a long moment, but this is because she is considering what to say.
"We've bunks on the ship," notes Kalaria, carefully. "And really, the hyperdrive went out mid-flight. Your fine establishment was the closest and most trustworthy on our path." Kali darts blue eyes towards Anazider, before looking back at the Twi'lek once more. "He's the one to negotiate with, really. We're here at his whim, honestly. He's the boss and all that," she says shoving a hand towards the Faleen prince. "'Fraid my time is his time, 'cause it's my fault for not catching the problem with the drive in the first place." She leans forward a little and quietly whispers, "So anything you can do to make my life easier'd be appreciated. He gets rite snippy when he's upset. And it's a SMALL ship."
((Deception! I'm just the hired help! Yup! Not that Anazider would mind that...))

### **Anazider** (2008-03-21 16:06:18)

Anazider quirks an eyebrow at Kalaria, although he keeps his amusement well hidden.
"I very well *can* blame you, and will." Returning his attention back to the Twi'lek, the prince folds one arm across his chest, the hand of the other arm cradling his chin delicately.
"But regardless, we will not be staying. I need only the parts - my mechanic," Anazider gives Kalaria a very poignant look at this, "will see to the installation and repair. Its what I pay her for, after all."
Drumming his fingers on his chim, the falleen nobleman walks a few steps away from the Twi'lek, feigning interest in one of the items on display as he speaks over his shoulder without looking.
"1000 for the actuator, and 2750 for the motivator. You'll notice I am being generous, considering the egregious treatment I've experienced thus far."
((Using persuasion to Haggle the price down by 50%, Tru. I'll also use my Pheromones here as well. I meditated for an hour before we got off the ship, so I'll keep the better of the two rolls.))

Garic curse's again as he is jolted from the electrical discharge. His temper past reasoning he aims at the device and squeezes off a shot. Aiming for that little red light should do the trick.

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-25 08:15:27)

Having his attention taking away from Anazider again by Kali. Serian turns back to Kali "Hired help oh your better then that! How much is he paying you perhaps I could make you a much better deal? You could work on some of the more exotic ship in the galaxy we are always looking for competent hands."
As Anazider projects his dislike of his current treatment C6T9 approaches the noble "I am more then able to assist in all your needs. We could arrange a deal for the parts alone that would be easily done. As for the prices we have an overstock of actuators at the moment and could go to 1000 credits, the hyper drive motivator is firm at as low as 5000 unless of course you are interested in a used model."
The hanger floor continues its daily routine several work crews methodically repair one ship then the next. To increase productivity each crew is assigned one duty, one crew repairs hull damage another hyper drive engines while another works on weapons. You also notice repair crews in red who seem to specialize in ship upgrades.
----------------------------------------------------
Meanwhile on the outer hull of the Biddy Crate Garic reaches for his blaster pistol. Once his hand hits the handle of his blaster the tracking device extends four small legs out the sides of its circular body. The legs dig into the ships hull a light blue semi transparent shield envelopes the little droid.
-With his blaster in hand Garic readies himself to take the shoot.
-The little droid lowers a small plasma torch from its underside. Sparks erupted from the hull as it begins to cut into the ship. (10 damage to the ships hull)
-Garic takes his shoot, but it goes wild and reflecting off the ships hull.

Eyes dart from the Twi'lek to Anazider, and back again. "Uh, hey, just a word of advice, pay attention to the Falleen or he'll take his business elsewhere and then make sure you don't have a business to come to. All politically, not thug-like like a Hutt, either. All with pretty words and lots of sweetness."
Reaching up, Kali runs a hand over her hair a bit nervously, before blinking at Vash. "So, we'll talk about your offer when you're done making your deal? If I've got the time. I mean, working on exotic ships does sound good and appealing," she notes. "And... what are the shifts like here? The pay, and ... um, how's the efficiency?"

Garic holsters his blaster with some difficulties and makes a mental note about not going out in zero gravity again. At least not for a long time at any rate. He backs off from the device, hoping to give himself enough room for a good well placed kick. Taking in account the awkwardness of the space suit and the inherit difficulties of performing a maneuver like this. He crouches down, ready to spring forward. "Tinain If this doesn't work I'll have to resort plan B."

### **Anazider** (2008-03-26 19:44:00)

Anazider holds up a hand to forestall any further rambling from Kalaria, the prince having reached the limit of nonsense he is willing to take. He stares Vash directly in the eyes, seeking to cow the man the through sheer force of presence.
"How is that loan to Lord Anzeri coming, Vash? Must have been... seven or eight years ago since you started it, yes? Judging by the volume of work you have here, and the prices you are charging, I would say you should have paid off the debt some time ago."
Placing both hands on the counter top, he leans forward speaking in low tones to the Twi'lek.
"But then again, the books have always been light, haven't they Vash? My father has always been a little too... *lenient* when it has come to collecting debts. I am sure he will likely be less so when I inform him of my treatment here, wouldn't you agree?"

Garic takes a running start, which in his bulky space suit and magnetic boots looks more like a slow motion jog. reaching the little droid Garic is assaulted by a shower of sparks the plasma torch continues to cut into the ships hull.
-Garic takes a running kick at the droid and misses
-The driods plasma torch continues to cut into the ship. Garic is lucky enough to not hit the burning torch.
Tinian`s voice comes over the com again "Hey guys we have company, and not the good kind."
((8 more damage to the Biddy Crate))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Serian lifts an eyebrow at Kali`s statement then continues "Well I only own the joint, much of the profits go to Blotus the Hutt. As for going to another supplier I am afraid you will not find any, I have the market on the station." At Anaziders statement Serian stares at the noble for a moment then begins to reply "Ah .... no .... it can`t be. Do you ....."
Serian receives a audible notification on his data pad. Looking at the data pad he begins to walk away "My apologies I have been called away. C6T9 see to their parts give them an extra one thousand credits off and stay with them until they have their ship repaired. Once again It was very nice to meet you all." Smiling Serian bows and gives a kiss to Kali`s hand before he briskly exits the lobby.
Left in the crowd C6T9 continues its previous statement "Who may I make this order out too and what will be the method of payment?"
As Alishia watches the hanger floor she notices several ships are being removed from the hanger bay. Many of the mechanics already working on various other projects all converge on the large empty space opening up on the hanger floor.
Tinian`s voice comes over the com again "Hey guys we have company, and not the good kind."
Just as Tinian makes her statement a large an familiar ship enters the hanger. The Hutts Pride drifts in with some noticeable damage across its hull and obvious engine damage.

Alishai watches the ship enter the hangar, disbelieving. It takes a moment for rational thought to take control once more.
*What's with the damage? Surely they didn't attack the station? Oh, I hope everyone's okay.*
Even as she thinks it, she knows the hope is a foolish one.
She turns abruptly, heading over to the others.

Kali blinks as Vash leaves, and lifts up a hand to wriggle her fingers. "Uh... bye?" she asks curiously of the Twi'lek and his sudden departure. Then she runs a hand over her hair and looks to Anazider with a shrug. The message over the comlink causes the young woman to wrinkle her nose and move next to Alishai as she watches the hanger below.
A low whistle escapes her lips. "She must have had more weapons operational than I realized last I check," she offers, before frowning. Clearing her throat she turns and even gives Anazider a bit of a curtsey. "Uh, Sir, Master, Boss? Just get the parts, have'em delivered and put in place, then let's get going. No need to stick around like a rabid jawa, I'm thinking..."
((And if Kali EVER gets a ship, I am SOOO calling it the Rabid Jawa!))

Anazider points a finger at Kalaria as if indicating, *No more of that nonsense*. The prince plugs his credit chip into the available port on the droid's desk.
"Prince Anazider, Lord of House Xinidan. Direct transfer from the secondary account linked to the credit chip, in the amount of 5000 galactic. That's for both the hyperdrive motivator and the actuator." He waits until the funds transfer is complete before taking his credit chip back and walking over to the view port, watching the preparations for the Hutt's Pride through narrowed eyes.
"Tinian, keep the engines primed. We might have to make the repairs ourselves while under sublight." Anazider speaks into his wrist commlink as he stands gazing down upon the colossal hutt ship. He broods over the next course of action, and the current turn of events, his chin resting in his hand.

As the Hutts Pride docks the waiting mechanic crews begin to repair the ship. Most of the other work within the hanger all but halts. The lobby droids begin to turn away the waiting customers, moans of complaints are heard as they exit.
Serian does not even look back as he leaves the lobby. Kali`s attempt to view Serian`s data pad is meetg with disappointment as the light creates a reflection off the display covering any information.
C6T9 accepts the credit transfer the mention of 5000 credits turns only a few heads, and the mention of a Prince turns none. The droid motions for the players to follow "This way Prince Anazider of the House Xinidan you and your party can oversee the transfer of the parts if you wish. Please note we are running a special on fuel this week, prices are at cost. Can I mark your ship down for a refill?"
Anaziders com to Tinian goes unanswered.
((Sorry Amy natural 1))

On the hull of the Biddy Crate the battle between Garic and the little tracking droid continues.
-The droid continues to cut into the ships hull (4 points of damage to the hull)
-Garics shoot hits home on the droids forward section. The blast bursts through the shields hitting the droids armor leaving a small hole. (22 damage)

Finally strolling back to close proximity with the others, Thandrim watches the Hutt destroyer with a tilted head. His face bears the mark of a young man seeing an 'impressive' ship for the first time, though the quiet words to his companions have nothing of awe in them. "Home, or an enemy of the Hutts. Regardless it is interesting that she took so long to arrive here. Perhaps her own hyper-drive has been damaged? In which case, we'd best hope 'our' purchase goes unnoticed and unneeded." Then the young man returns to looking about curiously once more.

"Yes, yes, add on a refueling as well."
Anazider waves dismissively to the droid as he follows after it. He spares a glance backwards for Alishai and her commlink, wondering if she will receive a response where he did not. The prince continues on, mostly lost in his thoughts.
"Try contacting Garic directly. Hopefully it is just an issue with the ship's internal comm systems."

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-01 07:58:06)

Alishai waits after sending her message to Tinian goes unanswered for a few moments before a slight dual click comes back over the com. Strange that she would reply in this manner, though with the quality of equipment acquired from Hopes End it could be a com malfunction.
C6T9 stands with its head tilted slightly to the right for a moment staring at Anazider before stating "We will have your ship refueled before the parts arrive. " C6T9 punches in some commands on his data pad.
The droid motions for your group to follow by stepping aside and reaching out with its arm towards the exit. "This way please it is only a short trip to the supply office. There we will gave access to repulsor lifts, it will make it much easier to bring the parts to your ship. I of course am at your service until the transaction is complete." With its last statement the droid bows to your group.
As your group begins to follow C6T9 to the supply office the droid replies to Thandrims statement. "Although the station is administered by Grumbo the Hutt the station has been owned by Blotus the Hutt. Much of the stations profits fill the wealthy lords coffers. Many would doubt the profitability of a station in a region of space such as this, the fact is that many travel to Sarlacc Station the flow of legal and illegal merchandise has keep this stations profitability a shinning gem for Lord Blotus."
The walk to the supply office is short, much of the interior of the station mirrors the exterior. Coolant leaks down some of the walls, various business transaction can be heard from the many side rooms that you pass on your way down to the lower levels.
At the supply office a very bored looking Gossam stares blankly at C6T9 as the droid approaches the desk. The supply office itself is a window cut into the wall with a counter serving as a desk. Inside the room two security droids scan intently at all local traffic. To the side of the office a double door with no handles an no control pad, obviously opened from the inside.
C6T9 begins "I am C6T9 here with a party of purchasers ..... "
The Gossam cuts the droid off "I know which droid you are, just give me the order and be on your way."
"Ok then." C6T9 passes the Gossam a data pad."Here you are Min, you will find its ll in order and that Prince Anazider, Lord of House Xinidan and his party are already paid."
Min scans the data pad then keys in on his computer "Well la de da! I told you before C6T9 I don`t care who the buyers are."
Behind the Gossam a door opens and a small repulsor sled is pushed out by a short Ugnaught. Min and the Ugnaught exchange a few words none of your group understands. Min stares past the droid at your group not at anyone in particular just at your group. "The attendant will deliver the parts to your ship, then return here." In a sarcastic voice Min continues "Oh I hope you enjoy the quality of Vash Inc products and shop again. Next!"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Garic also gets no answer from Tinian when he try`s to communicate with her. Scanning the hull of the ship Garic sees no sign of anymore tracking droids. Off in the distance Garic does spot another individual in a space suit. After a few blaster flashes its obvious this individual has taken the grand task of cleaning the mynocks off the Stations hull. As the individual fires a few shoots a small flock of mynocks scatters for another hiding place.
(( Of course Garic is free to answer any hails, if any of you have decided to contact Garic the com opens normally.))

Anazider speaks into his own wrist commlink, a slight trace of annoyance creeping into his voice.

### **simplyscribed** (2008-04-01 17:03:32)

Alishai returns Anazider's look, biting her lower lip while Garic speaks. The nervous gesture is so unusual on her it could be considered strangely endearing.
'Calm, Garic.' Alishai urges. 'If you're done, make your way back inside the ship. We're just coming back with the parts now. Once we're refuelled, we think we'll be leaving. Uh, his Lordship Xinidan is eager that these unexpected repairs don't delay his rendezvous so we'll be doing as much as we can en-route.'
She lowers her voice and turns slightly away from Anazider, not actually caring if he or anybody with her hears or not, but wanting to make it look like she does.
'You know how he gets if his little dalliances and trysts get ruined. Wouldn't want to get him rankled if we can help it. Over and out, Garic.'

The urge strikes Kalaria and the young woman smiles as she walks up to the Faleen Prince and tries to rub the top of his head. "That's okay, Anazider, if you're just a few years younger than I am. You're doing a great job of acting as mature as you can." Kalaria gives a wink, but the smile on her face is far from her eyes.
"So, I was thinking, that I want to oversee the loading of our purchase. You two okay with me dragging Thandrim with me back to the ship while you're waiting here?" asks the young woman, before just waving and strolling off, reaching out to grab Thandrim's elbow to make certain he has no choice BUT to come with her. Only once does Kali pause, just long enough to look over an astromech, and pat the top of it's rounded head, before wandering out and back to the Biddy Crate.

Anazider steps away from Kalaria, looking at her with disgust as she attempts muss his hair, although its a desperate effort with he standing nearly two meters tall.
"Younger? I am *47* galactic standard years old. I am considered young for my people, but we are certainly no where near in years. Although I can see how you would make that mistake, considering the decrepit way in which humans age."
He clucks his tongue at the girl, the act of ducking having disturbed the delicate of arrangement of his robing. He waves a hand at Kalaria, as if dismissing her from his presence while he goes about the business of setting himself.

Arm taken, the young Jedi-in-hidding seems to have had his next course chosen for him. Not that he appears to be struggling against it. A smirk is touched upon with Anazider's reaction to Kali's own attempted mussings of hair. "Humor, good 'prince.' Humor. And patience." The last is almost added as an afterthought. Almost. "It /was/ a good try, Alishai." Thandrim nods once to the woman before he is taken by Kalaria out and presumably back to the ship.

Garic reaches the hatch and crawls in. All systems check the inner hatch pressurizes and the light goes green indicating an all clear to enter the ship.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
As your group converses the Gossam repeats his last statement "Next!" then motions for your group to move along.
Kali and Thandrim head for the lift the short Ugnaught falls in behind them. Realizing the attendant is already heading for your ship the rest of you also wait for the lift.
C6T9 walks over to the lift seeing that one of you has already hit the control panel summoning a lift says "It should only be a short wait while the lift reaches our level." Noticing that your group is less interested in hearing him and more interested in conversing with each other the droid falls silent.
As your group waits you notice soft music in the back ground. Most likely coming from the lift itself.
-----------------------------------------
As Garic enters the ship the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. The ship is dark and quiet. It was well light when he exited the ship. Garic gets the odd feeling he is not alone.
Cautiously enters the ship lowering himself into the corridor floor. The hatch is a top access hatch which means Garic would have to jump down, only a short jump.
As Garics foot hangs down thought the hatch portal a strong hand grabs it and pulls hard. Garic comes crashing down to the corridor floor landing hard. Standing over him is a heavily armed Trandosan standing clad head to toe in black armor.
Garics eyes open wide as the realization that this Trandosan is none other then Kursk!

Kalaria is actually skipping the lift. Instead she's dragging Thandrim back through the shop in a brisk pace. Besides... muzak. *shudder* Kalaria frowns to herself as the she drags Thandrim along, looking at him. "Bring a weapon?" she asks him curiously as she moves. After all, the fatalist in Kalaria says that if Tinian can't answer, there's someone watching her to prevent it. So, logically, Kalaria has a bad feeling about this.

Garic attempts to kick out from under Kursk, aiming for his knee caps. If nothing else he can get to his feet and make a break for it.

Still being more dragged along than following, Thandrim speaks in a lowered voice to Kalaria as they take a slightly different route back to the Biddy Crate. "Conflict may be required, but do not make that your only option until all other options are removed." That however, appears to be all the more he's willing to say just now.

The lift takes a while before opening several individuals step off the lift and begin to form an increasing line at the supply office.
"Next!" can be heard in the background as the grumpy Gossam continues his increasing work load.
The lift empty the short Ugnaught pushes the large sled through the double doors followed by C6T9. The protocol droid waits for your party to enter before closing the doors and pressing the control panel to activate the lift.
Turning to Anazider "The trip will be short. Is there any questions you or your company wish to ask? I am also programed with a variety of topics which include but are not limited to human cyborg relations, racial linguist and local business." The droid tilts its head slightly and stares at Anazider waiting for a response.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The youngest of the group retrace their steps through the shop itself. Progress is slowed somewhat as business picks up and customers complaining about the service converge.
"What I have a schedule to keep, get my ship back in there!"
"Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am! ..... That's not what I asked you."
"Hey I will double the price no triple, some of us are in a hurry to get there ships fixed."
The Protocol droids do their best to calm the crowd but it is a loosing battle.

((Initative count Garic 10, Kursk 22))
-The large Trandoshan seems to stand there for a moment before speaking "Open your comm, call out to your friends." His voice cold, business like.

Garic fought to hold on. His eyes glassed over and his body shook. He was not afraid to die and strangely enough he felt no pain. *Am I dying?* He thought. *Could this be why I donâ€™t hurt?*  It was an effort to move, something so simple was now one of the hardest things he had ever done.
His arm moved and activated the com, then fell limply at his side as he fought back the darkness that was threatened to overcome him. He inhaled deeply. â€œKurskâ€¦â€¦â€¦.on the shipâ€¦â€¦..Iâ€™m sorryâ€ He managed to gasp. His body and mind realizing his final mission was complete let him succumb to the darkness. His body lay motionless before Kurskâ€™s feet, his com open.

### **chibiamy** (2008-04-09 13:20:27)

Kalaria felt the cold sinking in, only to be replaced by a burning fire from the words over the comm - the comm she had been, until now pretending to ignore. While her intention had been to be stealthy and what have you, now was not the time. With a snarl Kalaria stepped forward shoving a protocol droid aside, then others until she had enough room to actually break out in a run. Thandrim's warning about violence forgotten, all Kalaria could do was think about violence, how she would hurt Kursk for hurting one of her friends. The young woman paid little attention to anything else, letting her rage build up and blind her.
'We're coming, Garic,' came the fleeting through across Kalaria's mind, still not wanting to use the comm. (After all, it had been stolen from a Gamorean who KNOWS where it had been!) And despite the genuine worry about her friend, and a deep hidden desire to be comforting, even in her mind Kalaria's voice had a savage edge to it.
((OOC: Telepathy to Garic. And while Kali wanted to be comforting, I doubt it will come across that way. : ))

Anazider taps a fingertip on his lips as he eyes the droid. He prepares to ask a question when Garic's desperate message comes through over the commlink. The prince quickly looks past C6T9 to share a glance with Alishai. A hand comes to rest on the sporting blaster at his hip as Anazider splits his attention between the droid and the lift door.
"Yes... Very interesting... When was the last time Lord Anzeri visited the shop, hm?"
He continues to keep his eye on the lift door, anticipating its opening.

*Will this ever end?*

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-12 07:58:02)

Kali and Thandrim make good time getting to the loading bay. Outside you can see that fuel lines have already been hooked up to the Biddy Crate. The loading bay itself is still powered down except for one terminal monitoring the exchange of fuel. Kali attempts to focus on Garic but to no avail, things are just to confusing in the girls unfocused mind.
Through the hatches which lead to the extended bridge the pair find no opposition when they gain entry into the ship. Kali and Thandrim enter the ship intent on finding their friend.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The trip for Anazider and Alishai takes a little longer. The lift stops to pick up other passengers several times. The lift also stops several more times to let them off. The other passengers pay little attention to your group despite Anaziders hold on his blaster pistol.
When Anazider reaches for his blaster pistol C6T9 states "Oh my" and moves into a corner of the lift. At Anaziders question the droid responds "To my knowledge Lord Anzeri has never visited Sarlacc Station. That is to say he has never visited personally. Advertising campaigns in his name have been driving on the station many times, all funded by Vash Inc."
When Anazider and Alishai reach the loading bay slightly ahead of the droid and Ugnaught. The two find th loading bay empty with one terminal powered monitoring the flow of fuel into the Biddy Crate. Outside fuel lines can be seen attached to the ship.
The hatches to the extended bridge sit open. C6T9 and the Ugnaught enter the loading bay "We have completed the transaction. The bill for the fuel will be here momentarily I will stay to complete that end of the Transaction as well." The Droid stands in the doorway waiting for the transfer of fuel to end. The Ugnaught leaves the sled and exits the loading bay.
Inside the Ship Anazider and Alishai find Thandrim and Kali searching the ship. By the looks on their faces its obvious they have not found what they where looking for. In fact having searched the entire ship Kali nor Thandrim have found anyone on the ship, not Garic or even Tinian.
Interrupting your short reunion C6T9 enters the ship "The fuel Transfer is complete, the total comes to two thousand four hundred and fifty credits. How will we arrange payment for this transaction?" The droid stands in the entrance to the ship awaiting a reply oblivious to the emotions your group is having to a lost friend.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout the station many of the local businesses have shut down. A temporary measure during the visit of the stations owner. Back at Vash Inc many have gathered in the hallway that leads to The Hutts Pride. Races of all kinds have assembled to greet the Hutts visit. Standing along the walls the shop owners wait for the hatch to open. Serian Vash stands among them at the front of the line he will be one of the first to greet Blotus, beside the station security Miat Nassin who looks more like a cyborg pirate then local security. Her thugs line the corridor as well, they too have the look of a rough bunch.
The corridor has been decorated for the occasion. A red carpet replaces the old grey one, the lights have been changed to a light blue and dancing girls stand waiting with trays of food for the Hutt.
As the hatch opens a great cheer erupts from the corridor some of the Hutts thugs step out first several Gamorrens followed by Blotus who himself is flanked by serving girls. Behind the Hutt a few Rodians armed with blasters and Captain Marthg.
The serving girls approach the Hutt offering a varity of foods to which the Hutt samples much of. Miat Nassin bows to the Hutt then motions for her crew to do the same, many others bows as well.
The Hutt looks to Vash and speaks, his captain Marthg translates for him. "His highness wishes that the repairs to his ship be made a top priority for you Serian. He also wants to extend a welcome for you to join him in an upcoming match he has specially arranged for his return. You will have the honor of sitting beside The Grand Blotus."
The corridor comes to a hush as the offer is extended, it is rare that an offer like that would be made. The silence is broken when Blotus motions with his hand for his party to move along. Captain Marthg gives Serian a slight bow then follows behind the Hutt. As the greeting party disperses Miat whispers to Serian "Don`t disappoint Blotus you would not want him to send me looking for you." The woman then walks away her crew following behind.

### **Thandrim** (2008-04-16 10:11:02)

"They have been removed from the ship." Thandrim's words are quietly spoken despite the clear gravity of the situation and Kalaria's desperation to find Garic if not Tinian too. It is clear he was expecting trouble however, as only now does his light saber disappear again into his clothes. "Fortunately they are probably not dead. Unfortunately they are likely going to be used to lure the rest of us into a trap laid by this bounty hunter." Certainly leaving them behind is not an option he is entertaining.

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **chibiamy** (2008-04-16 10:18:02)

Kalaria is clearly devastated. Even while Thandrim states the truth, she starts looking through all the access hatches, everywhere she can think of for any sign of Tinian and Garic. Her anger wars with her despair, something that probably saves her from going into a complete rage. When it, at last, Kali has no where left to look on the ship, she silently walks past the group, and lays her hand heavily on the control panel which opens the door to Garic and Thandrim's room. "I don't know what to do," she offers up softly, her head not turned away before she walks in and heads to Garic's bunk. She flops on the floor in front of it and just stares. "I'm sorry. I don't know what to do," she tells the empty space there.

Serian watches the procession as they pass. *If only our agreement were not so lucrative.* He thinks to him self, and casually presses his com.

He thumbs the com again and strides off after Blotus, checking his blaster is secure and easily accessible as he goes.

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **Anazider** (2008-04-16 21:48:56)

"Make a second withdrawal from the same account." The prince gives the same authorization he had used previously, waving the droid off dismissively. He waits until the droid has departed the transport, and is out of sight completely, before beginning in earnest.
"Well, it does not take much to guess where they were taken." Anazider settles into the pilot's chair, looking out the viewport at the Biddy Crate's refueling crew.
"And there've been no ransom demands, or ultimatums issued, so one of two assumptions can be made: either they have disposed of Garic and mistress Lar, or they are keeping them alive for interrogation. My bet is on the latter." His voice is cold and detached as he seems to stare through the others, becoming somewhat lost in this thoughts.
"We will need to spring this trap, but on our terms. And for that, I suspect we will need more information."

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-04-17 11:22:40)

'I think that's a foolish conclusion, Anazider.' Alishai says quietly, looking out the viewpoint just as he does. 'Blotus doesn't benefit from waiting for us to make a move when he could easily come and take us by force right now. Therefore, it stands to reason that he still doesn't know we're here. Kursk has either taken our comrades somewhere else, or is still on his way to meet the Hutt.'
'Our options,' she says, crossing her arms tightly and closing her eyes, 'stand as follows. We hope Kursk hasn't gotten somewhere too safe and secure yet and rush out to find him, though I think it's likely he's already aboard the *Hutt's Pride*. Alternatively, we stay quiet and out of the way until the refuelling is done and get out of here while we still have a window of opportunity.'
Her voice breaks slightly at the end of her second suggestion, but she continues:
'I don't think we're in a position to mount a rescue attempt. We're lucky to still be alive after the last time we tangled with Blotus. If anything, he's more powerful here. It would be us against the station and everyone on it, with us *inside* the station. At least back in the mines we had friends and Blotus underestimated us - he won't again. We can't benefit ourselves by expending our lives on a well-meant but foolish heroic gesture. Garic and Tinian can't benefit from it either.'
'So,' she says, a tear escaping from under one of her closed lids and flowing slowly down her cheek, 'there it is. My vote is to leave. Garic would want that.'

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **master_Tru** (2008-04-17 14:48:27)

C6T9 tilts its head slightly then responds after a pause " I have been called away my apologises we will have to conclude this part of the transaction at a later time." The droid exits the ship with the hatch closing behind it.
Leaving the rest of your group alone to consider your options. Outside the ship three station personal work away at locking down the refuel lines a process slowed by the weightlessness of space. The old ship creaks slightly, you know its a result of its age and upkeep but it serves as a reminder to how empty the ship feels now.
From the outer hatch which leads to the loading bay the light flashes green indicating that some one is trying to gain access to the ship.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Yes sir we will have the Hutts Pride on priority schedule." replies one of the crew supervisors. Probably Jurfel or Zix Serian could never tell the two Verpine apart.
Catching up the Blotus is an easy feat the slug was never known to be swift. A few Rodians flank Serian as he approaches given a guarded escort as a personal guest of the Hutt.
Again Captain Marthg translates for Blotus "His worshiper is pleased by your efforts to repair his personal property and wishes to remind you of the luxuries of doing business with one such as Blotus the Hutt." Slowly the assembly proceeds to the lift which has just enough room for all.
The lift stops at the pit and the assembly proceeds to Blotus`s personal box. The Pit itself is a massive cone within the center of the station, with seating circling a series of holo emitters at the base of the cone. In the middle of the cone at the top an announcers podium floats over the crowd with a tall slender green skinned Twi`lek standing in the center. The Twi`lek is surrounded by a crew with monitors in front of them watching every possible angle of every match. Circling the holo stage are rows and rows of seating much of which are filled, most of the station must be here as well as a fair amount of the stations visitors.
Currently various holo commercials play with periodic announcements for the upcoming bouts. Servants cater to all the needs of the Hutts, with one servant assigned to Serian.
Bending down slightly the scarcely clad Togruta asks "Is there anything I could get for you? A drink or meal?"
As the festivities begin the first match starts, a large barrel chested Gamorrean wielding an wickedly barbed axe appears on the over sized projected holo stage. The Gamorrean is is a room with a piles of junk lining the walls. As the count from three to one finishes much of the junk rises, droids all in disrepair stagger towards the Gamorrean. Screens give a play by play of the fight in various languages as the announcer begins to excite the crowd.
And the betting begins.

"Alishai is right, of course. Whether you believe in luck, the Force, or something else entirely, we have all but expended more than our rightful share, and I would like to believe storming a Hutt destroyer would be beyond even our ken. Escape is our best option."

A bare moment is spared for a sympathetic glance at Kalaria before those eyes look elsewhere and narrow closely. "One moment, I must check something." The youth disappears around the corridor corner back where the cargo hold and engine are to be found at a quick jogging pace.

'Nor is it a bottomless well that will always provide.' Alishai responds to Thandrim, though the words aren't really meant for him since he has already left at a jog. 'It is more a sea or an ocean: always present, and always powerful, but you stand on the edge of a beach and the amount around you depends on the tides. We will always be touched by the Force, but whether it can be said to be "with" us depends on how shallow or encompassing the contact is at any moment.'

"Whichever the case may be, I still believe a hasty departure to be our best option, especially while that Hutt monstrosity is still in berth. I doubt we could take more than a glancing shot from a turbolaser."

Abruptly, Kali stands up, facing away from the pair. "I better make certain that we could take two glancing shots from a turbolaser, given our luck of late," says the young woman with a bit of a dull tone. "I hate this. I HATE IT!" she snaps before sighing and shaking her head and trying to push her way back to the engine room and make certain everything is installed correctly so the Biddy Crate can leave.
"One thing, Anazider," calls out Kalaria over her shoulder, "Tinian saved your ass getting us off the Last Hope. And she tried to warn us there was someone here when they boarded. That counts as twice she's saved you. Maybe you aught to think about repaying debts, rather than gathering them in your favor."

As Serian watches the first bout much of the stations populace cheers loudly as the Gamorrean smashes a droid. Inside the personal box of Blotus a Rodian works the odds on the current match on another screen Serian notices a pending match labeled main event, no details are present on the screen as opposed to the other screens that have detailed information on the matches.
-------------------------------------------
As your group discusses the current situation the outer hatch flashes again. No one enters but the indicator shows someone is trying to gain entry.
Kali heads for the engine room, the engines are in standby mode the low hum fills the area. Running an initial check before beginning the repairs on the hyper drive reveals an error in the engine system. The engine itself will not power down or up, stuck in standby mode. It will be impossible to repair the hyper drive or take off with the engine in this mode.

Returning down a different corridor, Thandrim oddly enough looks to be both puzzled *and* relieved. The youth's eyes swivel about noting Kalaria's absence but before he comments there is evidence of someone attempting to gain entry. A frown marks his face and the young man actually starts striding toward the hatch. "Deeper and deeper." Thandrim speaks quietly as he nears the hatch.

Anazider looks at the indicator then to Alishai, his right hand straying to the handle of his blaster as he makes sure the selector on the pistol is set to kill. He rises from the pilots chair and strides towards the access hatch, sliding his sporting blaster from its holster along the way.
The prince comes to stand just to the side of the hatch as he looks to the bodyguard and the Jedi, gaging their reactions.

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-05-10 20:06:19)

Alishai too sets her weapon to kill. The time for subtlety has long since started slipping away and an intruder is unlikely to be breaking in to distribute gifts.
She stands a short distance back from the hatch in case whoever is outside attempts a less-subtle and more-explosive method of entry. The blaster pistol in her hand is pointed toward the hatch at torso height for a human, her spare hand used to help hold it steady.
'You think we might be better opening the hatch ourselves before they damage it and make our escape chances slimmer?' She murmurs to the two men nearby.

Serian sighs and shifts his weight in the chair. He always hated playing nurse maid to the Hutt.

Of the three beings at the hatchway, Thandrim appears to be the only one that does not expect to have to kill or maim anyone in the immediate future. A strange thing considering the realities of their situation. "A thief, a messenger, a very clumsy stealth attack force, even perhaps an ally. Do try and not kill it before we know which hmm?" And then the young Jedi accesses the hatch door, standing slightly aside as it opens affording Anazider and Alishai clear lines of fire if the worst does come to be.

The Gamorrean finishes off the fight with the droids the holo vid changes to another commercial. Around Serian the hutts lackeys busy themselves with orders to televise the matches come in form all over the galaxy. Serian manages to see destinations like Bepsin, Coruscant, and Tatooine to name a few.
The holo vid begins its next match several Jawas can be seen running from a Rancor. The bidding begins again though the Rancor is the obvious favorite.
On of the Rodians turns from his station and reports to Blotus "My lord wwwe have and issue. One of the Nexu have escaped it may have to be put down if they can not contain it again."
Blotus yells in frustration and slams his fist against a nearby white protocol droid. The droid flails on the ground trying to get back up, one of the guards puts a blaster bolt in its back then congratulates Blotus on such a mighty swing.
Blotus ignores the Rodian guard and checks a data pad, the only piece of equipment in the Hutts visible possession.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The hatch continues to periodically flash until Thandrim opens it which ceases the indicator. Outside the loading bay is empty and quite the stations are once again powered down and the fuel crew has long since packed up.
In the middle of the loading bay is a heavy blaster pistol.
Kali continues to work within the engine room,but unfortunately has made very little progress with the system repair.

Oblivious to the curiousity of the hatch, Kali is pounding away on the engines. Litererally. She picks up a spare hydrospanner, not the one she brought with her, and bangs it on the engine in hopes of locking down the problem, beating it into submission and thus getting it to work.
This does, of course, fail. But it helps work out the building frustrations in Kali. Taking a slow, deep breath, the young woman closes her eyes and tries to center herself - a very difficult task, mind you. Swallowing deeply, she then opens her eyes and stares at the engine for a moment. "Okay," she says, stroking the piece of technology, "Tell me what you need, what I need to do. Come on," she murmurs softly. "Tell me what you need."
((OOC: I'll spend a Force Point here to make some progress... ANY progress!))

The young Jedi tilts his head a little to look out the hatch some and see the lack of anyone there. No direct signs of anyone right /now/ but surely there's something. Unless...
"Someone should go and get Kalaria." Thandrim speaks with a curious tone. A steady inhale is taken as he looks out.

'There's no mistaking the point of this little piece of theatrics,' Alishai murmurs.
'I'll go tell Kali, but we really shouldn't take her away from repairing the engines whatever happens. Whatever we decide to do. It's either her or myself that needs to get that done, and I'm the better hand with a blaster.'
The soldier moves swiftly to the rear of the ship, calling out 'Kali?' even before she arrives to make sure the girl expects her.

Serian tilts his head at the big hutts reaction. It always amused him how such a powerful figure in this galaxy acts much like a two year old human child. Never the less Serian tries to catch a peek at what the hutt just might be punching in that data pad, not to mention keeping a watchful eye on those screens.
((Trying to gather information, will use a force point if it will net me anything useful, lol))

Kali continues her work on the engines noticing several key parts need to be realigned. Realizing this will take time on her own Kali sets to the large task of repairing the ship. Creating a mess Kali sits in the engine room with all the access panels open and her tools scattered about.
Alishai walks into the engine room to find Kali curled in a ball on the floor staring off into space. Beads of sweat drip from her brow, though she feels cold to the touch.
Anazider watches as Thandrim kind of spaces out staring off into space. As Anazider waits for his friends a small little mouse driod scurries into the loading bay. By itself a common part of any station or large ship, but this little mouse droid has been modified with an arm attachment.
The droid zips into the loading bay stops in front of the blaster then zips out of the loading bay with the blaster in tow.
----------------------------------------------------------------
The match with the Jawas does not last long, the holo image fills with the gore of the last Jawa as the Rancor finishes its feeding. The response from the viewers is nothing less then deafening. Cheers erupt from the stadium, cheers and crys for more.
Serian continues to watch both the matches and the work stations. Blotus keep his data pad to close and always puts it away after every use. Most likely the Hutt is calculating profits.
Serian does notice a single station is dedicated to whats labeled as the main event. The screen shows multiple images overlapping. Caged Nexu, an empty arena with shoddy jungle back drops, Kursk and a few of the Void Viper mercenaries waiting in an empty room, and the last image is of the station interior just outside the loading bays.
Not sure of what all this means Serians thoughts are cut short as a cold feeling crawls down his spin. On or the Rodians approaches Blotus in a subservient bow. "My Lord you ..."
Blotus bombards the Rodian with insults before the Rodian manages "I know my lord but its the call." The Rodian holds a small holo-emitter a dark image appears on the screen robed and clouded in darkness. The image gives Serian a bad feeling.
"Ah lord Vermain I have been expecting you, I take it you are pleased with the show thus far." Taken in shock this is the first time Serian has ever heard this Hutt any Hutt speak in basic.
The figure responds as he talks fear runs though Serian. Hate can be felt within his words. "You promised me a show like no other."
"It has only just begun we have much more planned Lord Vermain. You have my word." The image nods then fads away at the Hutts words. When the channel is cut Blotus returns to his native tongue shouting out orders which doubles the efforts all inside the box.

It is several moments before Kali's eyes focus on Alishai's feet. Even then, the young woman draws in a hissing breath and looks as if she is preparing to scream, her skin so very pale as she trembles into consciousness. With spanner still in hand, Kali covers her mouth, biting down on the heel of a hand to keep the scream in check, squeezing her eyes shut in an effort to rid herself of whatever terrible vision overtook her.
It isn't difficult to see that the young woman has tears streaming from her eyes as she closes them so tightly and shivers due to the chill that has come over her. Kali is trying, trying so hard to fight the fear and anger both, before she finally pulls her hand away gasping for breath, laying silently where she is, curled in a ball on the floor of the engine room.

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-05-19 14:25:34)

Alishai drops to her knees and lifts Kali from the floor, pulling her into a position where she can lean against Alishai and Alishai in turn can hold her.
She attempts once to stop the girl biting her hand, but aborts it when she sees she'll do more harm than good trying to prise it away from Kali's teeth. Instead she wipes away Kali's tears and for a short while lets the silence linger.
She would like to let Kali take her time. But time is a luxury it is clear they don't have, and she can handle the younger girl thinking her cruel if it is to come to that.
'Somebody tried to get into the ship, then left their pistol in the hangar,' she explains. 'An attempt to coax us out, I think.'
'And you,' she pauses to let out a long sigh, 'you've had another Force vision, haven't you? Was it Garic?'

---

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **chibiamy** (2008-05-19 16:52:52)

Kali continues to squeeze her eyes closed, indulging in the comfort of someone else's arms around her. oh, she'll be angry at herself later, but right now, she is simply to cold physically and mentally to fight it. As Alishai speaks, kalaria slowly starts to open her eyes, leaning more heavily into the woman. "I... I don't know. It ... it was more like a memory," she offers hoarsely before swallowing loudly. "I ... I heard a scream, but just brushed it off. Then I heard it again, and it felt so cold. Then I was on Aloon again, running, running from the shadows, or something in the shadows, I don't recall. And people were screaming and dying everywhere. And in the background, above all the pain and suffering and death, joyful cries as someone or something or things took joy in their gruesome task. It... I don't know what it was, Alishai."
Just a moment more, and then Kali is trying to push away from the woman, still trembling and not really ready to be released, but that stubbornness is back and Kali tries to be self-reliant once more. "I ... don't know if it was Garic. I never saw the face of who was screaming. But it was cold. So very cold. I don't THINK it was Garic. I think ... it was the shadows, or whatever was in the shadows on Aloon. I think it's the same thing." A hand reaches up to run over Kali's hair and the young woman wrinkles her nose with a sigh. "I wish I could be more helpful. But... the repairs aren't difficult, they'll just take ALOT of time. I should get back to them."

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-05-19 20:43:19)

Alishai listens to the details of Kali's memories - were they memories? Dreams? Visions? Some form of mental attack? - and continues to hug her close, stroking her hair in a vague but ultimately comforting way as she takes in the poor girl's latest woe.
The older woman doesn't interject, and offers no thoughts on what it could mean. Instead she focuses on Kali's final comment.
'Yes,' she agrees, 'they need to be done. And you need time...'
'Kali,' Alishai adds slowly, releasing the girl from her hold, 'please listen to what I am about to say and don't interrupt me or it will make it hard.'
She exhales then continues:
'I don't want to burden you with more dark thoughts, believe me, but I have to face the reality that I might not leave this station. You need more time than you have and I'm the best qualified to buy it.'
She reaches up her sleeve and withdraws the silver lightstaber concealed there. Turns it slowly, first left and right, as though memorising every last detail of what it is. Maybe, more than that, she is thinking about what it *represents*.
'I have been a failure at everything I've set my mind to. This time, it has been my promise to myself that I will protect you and Thandrim and I will gladly pay any price for it to be so. Therefore, if something happens to me you mustn't grieve. It would be an insult to my mission and my memory to make me into that kind of burden.'
Alishai looks up and smiles.
'I want you to look after this lightsaber,' the knight says, taking Kali's hand and placing it gently in her palm. 'My armour too. Keep them safe, and keep them hidden. If I cannot return to claim them they are yours to do with as you see fit.'
'My advice, should you wish to take it, is to seek out the Imperial Remnant. There you may find protection and receive training so that you may learn to protect yourself. You may even learn to let go of your anger, or,' she acknowledges the difficulty of the task with a slight incline of her head,' at least learn to tame it and turn it into the cold fury of the just. You must manage that, at least, or you will be consumed.'

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **chibiamy** (2008-05-20 00:35:10)

For once, Kalaria is too shaken to interrupt Alishai. And as the woman continues to speak, the younger woman's eyes grow larger and larger. Finally, Kali is shaking her head, and gritting her teeth. "Nothing is going to happen to you, Alishai. Why do you need to talk like that?" she hisses, biting back her own fear. Her eyes trail over the lightsaber, and Kali looks away, uncertain about taking it, her hand trying to recoil from it.
"I... don't know if I want anything to do with the Remnant, or with the Alliance and the Jedi, Alishai. I ... why are you asking me to do this?" comes the choked words as blue eyes turn back to the older woman. Reaching up, fingers scrub through Kali's hair as she growls in frustration, frustrated at being so frightened and angry all the time. "Ali, you've done more right than you're willing to admit, damnit all! Stop talking like that. Just..."
Finally, Kali stops her brief fight of Alishai, wrapping her fingers around the hilt of the lightsaber, giving a stern glare at the woman across from her. "Look, I'll hold onto this, and I'll keep your armor safe. But damnit, we are ALL getting out of this alive." There is a faint pause and Kali lets out softly with a shuddering breath, "What is left of us..."

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-05-20 10:15:24)

Alishai smiles sadly, then turns slightly so that she can only see Kali from the corner of her eye. It makes the discussion a little easier not to see her expression directly.
'I am doing it because you *must* receive training and learn control. I would not force you down the path of the jedi unwilling, but simple expediency makes it so. You are travelling with two. Whether you ultimately choose to join the Jedi or the Imperial Knights, or neither, is not my concern. Whatever the case it will make your journey easier if you have the necessary tools. Thandrim will find the task of teaching you simpler if you have a lightsaber of your own, and it will hardly matter if my true past is revealed to him by that point. He may even forgive me for it.'
A momentary pause, barely a second, as Alishai runs her fingers through her hair.
'As for suggesting you pick a side... well, we've had that discussion. I know how you feel, and you have every right to be wary. Particularly of the Empire. But Kali, some one out there, maybe even Darth Krayt himself, knows about you. You need protection from him, at least until you have become skilled enough to protect yourself and go into hiding. Who better to go to than other Force-users who have already proven adept at evading the Sith? I suggest the Imperial Knights over the Alliance and Jedi only partly out of personal bias. We undergo training as stormtroopers as well as with the Force. Unlike a Jedi, who are less martially minded, we are skilled soldiers as well as skilled with the Force. I suspect you will need both if you are ever to claim your life back.'
'Now,' she gets to her feet, 'I should not distract you longer from your repairs. May the Force be with you.'
She brightens, wearing an almost cheerful expression. Just in case, as she thinks likely, this is to be her farewell.

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **chibiamy** (2008-05-20 12:17:15)

Kalaria swallows deeply, turning the lightsaber hilt over and over in her hands as she listens to the rest of Alishai's words. And she does actually listen. Even stubborn Kalaria knows now is not the time to huff and dig in like a stubborn gundark. Biting back tears as she grits her teeth, Kalaria's fingers grip the hilt tightly, before she stuffs it into the tool belt she wears.
There is a long pause at the last of Alishai's words and Kali has to look away to wipe at the tears she doesn't want to show, before she clears her throat and leans over her work again. "You know," she says, softly, "It'd help if you could just stay a few minutes, maybe, and help out here. Just... just a little longer. I won't grump, I promise."

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-05-20 14:38:40)

Alishai pauses.
'Okay, a few minutes,' she allows after a moment's thought, 'show me what needs doing.'
In truth she is grateful for the time to think: for she has no actual plan in mind yet, just the firm idea that she needs to do *something*.

Serian takes a deep breath and readies himself for what just might be a ill timed moment. He turns in his sit to face the hutt and props his elbow on his knee, his chin resting lightly in his palm. "Lord Blotus," He scratches the side of his cheek with his other hand. "I wish to thank you again for your wonderful hospitality and for inviting me to partake in this painstakingly well planned event." He pauses for effect hoping the flattery will stave off any hostile repercussions. "However, my curiosity has got the best of me and I can hardly contain my excitement for the last...." He smiles. "and greatest fight. Would I be able to at least get a hint of what to expect?"

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **master_Tru** (2008-05-31 07:04:57)

Blotus looks down on Serian measuring him for a moment before bellowing out in laughter. As he speaks a near by Rodian translates "Lord Blotus has prepared a great battle one that will impress all the viewers. This fight will have combatants never seen before on the holo-vid, they have talents many wish to acquire."
Another Rodian turns and speaks to Blotus "The Nexu have been captured and are now being transported to stage 5, the last of the elements are about to be in place soon and the fighters are almost ready." Turning back to his screen the Rodian continues his work.
Blotus continues as the other Rodian translates "Ah Lord Blotus says the match will soon begin make yourself comfortable you are a guest after all."
Servants bring out another round of food and drink, just as Serians com goes off "Serian what kind of orders are these? Whats this about impounding ships is this order right? Are we suppose to impound the ship docked at the outer loading bay?" Its Jurfel or Zix again though still not sure which, which ever it is there is a sense of urgency in his voice one would not expect from a Verpine.

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **Rowen** (2008-05-31 08:16:07)

Serian smiles at the hutt in feigned excitement. "I can hardly wait!" and turns around in his seat. Pressing the ear piece tighter into his ear he leans forward as if watching the show an whispers. "What ship? and who said impound anything?" He looks over his shoulder making sure he's not being watched. "Your suppose to be fixing Bloutus ship!"

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **Thandrim** (2008-06-04 10:52:05)

Taking a slow breath and frowning, Thandrim reaches over to the control panel and closes the entry hatch. "I do hope this ship does not have any 'secret' entrances. For I am certain there is still someone trying to get into the ship." The words are given as he looks back at Anazider. Neither of them are to be much good when it comes to repairing the ship's systems, so they are somewhat left to hold the fort as it were. The youth does not move away from the hatch, catching a glance at the controls a moment before putting a hand to his chin in thought.

It's been several minutes of relative silence between the two women. Of course there have been a few words, asking for this, that, or the other, and Kalaria pointing and describing what needs to be done, and how if Alishai needs it. The younger woman wipes the back of her hand across her face, smudging some oil across her forhead, but she doesn't even notice. Instead, she looks at Alishai in a sidelong manner, the declarations earlier making her just as nervous as the horrible memory which struck her so hard.
Inhaling deeply, Kalaria finally stands. "Come on, let's get some food and something to drink before I fall over again, this time from lack of nourishment," she notes. Stretching her back and her arms above her head, Kalaria sighs and looks down the hallway. "Huh. The boys have not bothered us. Thank the Force for small mercies, eh?" she asks before nodding towards the common are. "Come on. Let's go."

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

Alishai sets down her tools and turns away from the panel she had been working on.
'Good idea,' she replies, moving past Kali and along the corridor, 'and then you can help me by hacking the station's systems and finding out where this hangar's controls are located. I have a feeling our ship won't be allowed to leave unless we force the issue.'

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

It's with a sudden lurch that Kali comes to a stop, pale-faced once more. "I... just heard Garic. I swear... I swear it was him, Alishai. What... what do I do?" asks the younger woman as she pivots and swings her gaze towards the Knight.

Serians caller comes back "Most of the crew is working over time to fix Blotus`s ship, some even triple shifts. The order to impound came from one of the Huts`s goons, Boss this is not what I signed up for. Since when do we take direct orders from his goons anyway?" Frustration is clearly heard in the voice, in the back ground other voices can be heard.
"The scanners show life signs."
"We are not mercenaries, what are we suppose to do?"
"I want a raise if I have to get my hands dirty!"
The caller comes back "Boss me and the boys we are not exactly happy about this! What do we do? ... I donâ€™t want to upset a Hutt."
------------------------------------------------------------------
Just as Thandrim is about to close the ships hatch voices can be heard getting closer. The voices are coming from the loading bay, as nothing was there before it looks as though they just got there. One voice is too hard to make out a few others are clear:
"The scanners show life signs."
"We are not mercenaries, what are we suppose to do?"
"I want a raise if I have to get my hands dirty!"

"Answers perhaps from unanticipated angles..." Thandrim says quietly almost more to himself than to Anazider behind him. The young Jedi now apparently has chosen not to close the hatch, instead retreating quietly into the ship and around the near corner to hide. Who knows, they may surrender if confronted strongly enough. With his lightsaber now out but still unlit, Thandrim hopes Anazider is up to the task of being fearsome. Someone has to be after all!

## Re: Chapter Two "Cross Roads"

### **Rowen** (2008-06-17 17:35:24)

Serian looks nervously around. This wasn't part of his deal with the blasted hutt. He turns forward again and whispers in the comm. "Do not impound the that craft!" His anger wells up inside him and he almost looses control. "I'll be there shortly, just let me come up with something."
With that Serian pushes two finger in his mouth and forces himself to gag, hoping it fool the others in the booth into believing he was getting sick. With much coughing and sputtering he half turns and bows to Blotus. "My lord, if I may take my leave......" another bout of coughing and gaging over take him. "I need to walk this out and perhaps take my medicine.......thought I had shaken this nasty virus."

Alishai grips Kalaria's arm, lightly enough to be considered a comforting squeeze but tight enough to restrain the younger woman if she decides to act in a rash way.
'Nothing yet,' The Imperial Knight answers as her intense gaze focuses unwaveringly on Kali's eyes, 'it might have been real or it might not. Either way it might not be something we can act upon. What did you hear?'

### **chibiamy** (2008-07-05 23:26:40)

It's not intentional, but Kalaria leans into that grip on her arm a little, her eyes closing. Slowly Kali tries to calm her breathing, and calm her own nerves. "It was weak and faint, but I heard his voice say 'Help me'," says Kalaria with a brief shake of her head.
"How can someone put Garic's voice in my head? It WAS Garic's voice. It wasn't someone else's. I swear, but... but.. what do we do?" she asks, shaking her head, trying to calm herself down again - still.

'How could Garic put his *own* voice in your head?' Alishai replies sharply.
'He isn't Force-sensitive, he doesn't have the ability. No, either it's somehow false or you yourself unwittingly sought him out.'
She continues toward Thandrim and Anazider, pulling Kali with her gently yet inexorably.
'Whatever the case is,' she adds as they walk, 'you cannot afford to be distracted right now. Close your mind, Kali. Go through the exercises you've been practicing.'

### **Anazider** (2008-07-06 12:44:55)

Anazider makes certain that the selector on his hunting blaster is shifted to lethal, having had quite enough of all the tomfoolery the station has had to offer. He glances at Thandrim to assess his readiness before looking to Alishai, with a seemingly hesitant Kalaria in tow.
"Looks as if someone's come for an easy pay day... Or so they think. This ship has now become a sitting target, I'm afraid, and I suspect the longer we tarry here the more miscreants we'll have filing in to collect on us."
Taking a quick peek around the corner through the hatch, the Prince hopes to assess just how many are in the hangar and how they are arrayed, without giving away his position.

The voices close in on the ship shadows play across the entry way. A rustling of something metallic can be heard with the foot steps and a weird flapping sound which is creating a slight breeze. Three individuals enter the ship, all quite surprised to see Anazider and Thandrim.
A Verpine with polished tools lining his tool belt immediately raises its arm an activates a communicator. "Boss this ship is not empty, this just got more complicated. We need orders now!"
The second a Toldarian hovers slightly behind the Verpine. Greasy in appearance the Toldarians tools have been neglected sitting haphazardly along its tool belt. It raises a hydro spanner when it seeâ€™s Anaziders blaster and shouts "What are you doing on this ship? No one is supposed to be here!"
The third a balding human with many scares across his face and a cybernetic left arm stand behind the first two staring off at a bulk head. Seemingly uninterested in the whole event.
----------------------------------------------------------
As Kali and Alishai converse, shouting can be heard from the entry way direction. The voices are unfamiliar to you one can barley be made out but the other sounds angry.
"What are you doing on this ship? No one is supposed to be here!"
------------------------------------------------------------
Blouts looks down on Serian and stares a moment. Laughing the Hutts Rodian lackey translates. "Blotus gives you permission to take your leave." The little Rodian chuckles at Serian "Try not to be too long or you will miss all the fun."
Leaving the Hutts personal viewing box the corridors are empty most if not all of the station are inside the arena. Itâ€™s not long before Serian realizes he is being followed.
Serians foot steps echo throughout the corridors and in an attempt to mirror then so does another set of foot steps.
Before Serian begins to decide what to do about this new issue the com link opens again, Jik`s voice calmly comes in "Boss this ship is not empty, this just got more complicated. We need orders now!"

Fighting back a shaking that threatens to overtake her, Kalaria simply nods to Alishai. The young woman swallows deeply, then closes her eyes momentarily, allowing Alishai to truly lead her as she works through several calming exercises she has been taught by both Alisha and Thandrim, no doubt.
When the surprised shout comes from the 'repossessors' Kalaria's eyes snap open, much calmer than they had been before. "What?" she hisses under her breath, fighting back the anger that struggles to well up in her. "No one is supposed to be here? I'll show them no one," she offers with a frown turning down her lips. Glancing at Alishai, Kalaria nods, pulling forth the heavy blaster from it's holster, before looking at the lightsaber that is set in place like a hydro-spanner. "Grab it if you want it," she notes, "And I'll try to follow your lead. Promise."

Anazider manages to smirk while speaking with little emotion, his crystal blue eyes boring holes in the Toydarian. His blaster rises in a snap, the muzzle becoming level with the creature's snout, his other hand rising to signal Alishai and Kalaria to not come closer to the hatch.

While Anazider takes a more direct approach, Thandrim contents himself with leaning against the near wall to tap a finger against his chin. Musing more to himself than apparently anyone else, the young human speaks in a passive tone. "I wonder if it's customary here for people to try and 'repossess' whatever ships land. Just in case they can get away with it." With a shrug, he appears to be willing to let Anazider handle the details.

The Verpines communicator comes to life as he continues his conversation. The voice on the other end sounds rushed.
"You want orders? How bout this....do nothing, if Blotuses goons give you trouble....."
"eliminate them, knock them out.....I don't CARE!"
"If you can't fight back at least stall them until I get there, got it?"
The Verpine takes his attention away from his communicator long enough to look up at Anazider the to his Toldarian compainion. "Snibitt put that away we are not mercenaries." The Verpine then goes back to his communicator "Rodger that boss, I will do what I can Jik`s out."
The Toldarian Snibitt grumbles under his breath lowering the hydro spanner. As he does so he slowly floats back behind Zix.
----------------------------------------------------------
Serian continues his pace towards the loading bay. Reaching the promenade the sounds of others running can be heard as well voices.
"Ha! Now will we get that docking fee!"
"You will probably wet yourself."
"Shut up! I..... "
"Both of you shut up before I blast you both right here. Keep running."
The last voice being the female voice of Mait head of the Void Stalkers, what passes for security on this station. The other two unknown, though most likely Stalker wannabes.

Thandrim raises his right eyebrow slightly. That's it, just the eyebrow.

"Gentlemen, it is obvious you've made a poor career choice somewhere along the way here. And your employer doesn't quite seem to have your best interests in mind, either. As such, I've a counter offer: You can leave this hangar by the count of... oh, lets say three, and I won't have to make orphans of your likely-very-many illegitimate children. How does that sound?"
The prince quickly looks to make sure he is not on the loading ramp himself, without taking his attention from the Verpine and his gang.
"One."
Anazider gestures to Thandrim with his free hand, first indicating the Jedi and then the controls for the loading ramp.
"Three."
((If they don't back down, then Aim + Fire at the Verpine, Tru.))

Serian walks out from the corridor, placing his hands on his hips. "Whats going on here! I demand to know why you are disrupting the repairs on Bloatus's ship!" he doesn't have to fake an angry expression, the continued brutality and dictator ship of the Hutts was starting to wear old and he found his emotions getting the best of him. "I do not think Lord Bloatus would appreciate any delays!" He waited for an explanation.

As the Falleen noble makes his demand to the group of mechanics and begins his count down they all look at each other. "There crazy, all of them." They turn and bolt out the hatch. "Damn he hit three he is going to shoot, run faster."
"I donâ€™t have to run just fly faster then you guys."
Their blaring retreat can be heard as they continue through the corridors. Leaving the young jedi and noble alone in the entry way.
------------------------------------------
Serian rounds the corner only to stand face to barrel with a small strike force. Miat Nassin and several of her void viper thugs are gearing up weapons and armor in the middle of a corridor. Several of them raise weapons at Serians bursting introduction leveling them at the Twilek.
Miat holds a closed fist to her team and they instantly lower their weapons and continue checking the gear. "We are her under orders from Blotus. Not that its any of your business." With Miats remark towards Serian a few of her thugs enjoy a short chuckle. "Now move along this is not your concern ..... I would not want a stray blaster bolt to accidentally hit an innocent bystander."
-----------------------------------
Both Kali and Alishai clearly hear the commotion between Anazider and the ships "guests." Anazinders shouting, followed by the screams of the retreating visitors.

He levels his gaze at Mait, clear distaste marring his features. "I should have known it was you. However, you should keep in mind that my crews are working in and around this area, if even one of them comes under any harm it will slow our work on your lords ship." He pauses to allow the information to sink in. "As for it being my concern I would say yes, it is. My hangar, my business, now be a good girl and fill me in on whats going on so I can help. Or are you going to keep your underage school children here amused with your antics?"
He takes a confidant stride forward. "I know every inch of this place backward and forward." He grins, known she can't doubt the logic in that statement.

Anazider quickly holsters his blaster as the trio of would-be thieves make their hasty retreat. He retracts the boarding ramp before making for the cockpit.
"Alishai, secure the rest of our hatches; I doubt we require further unwanted guests. Thandrim, keep any eye on the main boarding ramp, in case our friends decide to try and plasma torch their way in. I am going to keep a watch from the cockpit."
The Prince doesn't stop to see if his orders are being followed as he stalks his way toward the cockpit.

Alishai moves to act upon the Falleen's instruction, glancing over to Kali as she does so.
'Break's over, I'm afraid. This bird needs to fly and you're the one to mend its wings.'
She proceeds to secure the ship as best she can against unwanted entry.

Kalaria frowns deeply, looking at Alishai, then back at the others. As silently as she can, the young grease-monkey runs back to the engine room and frowns. "Now come on, you blasted bucket of bolts, I need you to be nice and let me unlock you quickly, got that?" There's a faint pause and Kali glances around. "And I promise not to pound you with a hydro-spanner if you do."
((Edit - OOC: Uh, yeah, computers skill! And um... Force Point if I have any left! Gotta get this thing FLYING! Quickly? I mean, I AM supposed to be a slicer, right? I can do this! Really! ))
