**"Viszzzion online. Thiszzz thing is ugly. Lookzzz like tasty humanoidzzz,"** the Colicoid in front of Thrax A-88 says to his partner.
**"We will never build another unitzzz like the droidekazzz,"** says the other Colicoid technician.
Thrax A-88 lays on a table set at a 45 degree angle inside what appears to be a warehouse. Massive storage containers, roughly 3 x 2 x 15 meters in dimension, are stacked haphazardly throughout the room. He notices most of the closest ones are refrigerated, and judging by the well fed look of these two technicians, he can guess why.
**"List zzzstatuszzz and operating parameters unit A-88zzz,"** the first technician says, his buzzing accent would make his speech difficult for an organic, but it doesn't effect Thrax.

The droid on the table remains motionless for a few moments as its photoreceptors stabilizes. Once they do, he looks around. After completing his survey, his gaze settles on the two Colicoid. Internal circuits flares to life as his processor makes a friend-or-foe assessment of them, and they come up as "potentially hostile". In fact, the response time for the part of his memory containing "friends" is so extreme one could almost think it to be empty. In response to the potentially dangerous situation, the power core of the blaster rifle under his left arm starts to power up, even building up the power in its extended blast chambers to further prime its power. Sitting up straight, he raises his arms and tries to move them around, and then jumps off the table.
**"Assessment: Primary power core, processing unit and motor functions operating at 100 percent. No internal or external damage detected. This unit is ready to fight"**
Turning around and looking at the two scientists, he folds his right arm in front of him, allowing the vibroblade attached to it to be seen in its full length.
**"Curious Addendum: This unit´s sensors flags all additional personnel in the vicinity as potential threats. If no new data is received, this unit will engage primary protocols and proceed to terminate all unconfirmed allies"**

**"Hmmmzzzz. It iszzzz working,"** the Colicoid on the left says as the droid responds to coming online.
**"Yeszzz. It may be ugly, but it remindszzz me of the neszzzt. A-88zzz. Go forthzzz and counquerzzz,"** the one on the right replies with a hint of pride.
**"zzzShould we announczzze that it iszzz a Colicoid Creationszzz prototype?"** the first asks.
**"No,"** answers the second, **"We don't want the bad presszzz if it loseszzz. Just upload the arena locatzzzion while I open the doorzzz."**
The one on the left turns to the bank of computers and clicks away at the keyboard. Shortly thereafter a map appears in the top right portion of Thrax's HUD, just above the Nearby Organic Vital Signs Display and to the left of the motion tracker, which registers the movement of the Colicoid on the right as it manipulates the controls the warehouse doors.
The Colicoid near the doors straightens a bit and says, **"Make uszzz proudzzz."**

**"Statement: Primary objective location acquired. Command received. Initiating mission protocols"**
Acknowledging the two scientists as unlikely hostiles, or at least a minimum threat, A-88 lowers his bladed arm back to his side and started for the door. Just before he passed through it, he halted and turned back towards the Colicoid.
**"Probing Query: Are targets encountered on route to primary objective to be neutralized? If so, this unit seems to be sub-optimally equipped, and would request a refit in order to effectuate the execution of orders"**

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-20 00:19:59)

**"Did we put a heurizzztic procezzzor in thizzz droid?"** the Colicoid nearest the door asks the other.
**"Yezzz…. well, the zzzpeczzz zzzay we did,"** the second replies.
**"Poor programming then,"** the first grumbles. **"For good PR for the Colicoid Creazzzion Nezzt neutralizzze only gladiatorial combatantzzz,"** the first tells Thrax. He continues with: **"The arena grantzzz cazzzh prizzzezz. Utilizzze all prozzzeedzzz to upgrade azzz necezzzary."**
After finishing the doors to the warehouse slide shut and Thrax turns to scan the street. The unit observes thousands of lifeforms scattered and wandering the alleys and thoroughfares. He can discern no known combat strategy in their behavior. His map updates his location, the closest Arena is 7.23 minutes travel 13 degrees east of the units current heading.

## Re: Colicoid Creation Nest Beta Test

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-20 15:57:59)

**"Disappointed Acknowledgment: This unit will not initiate battle until it reaches the arena"**
Ushered out of the warehouse, the droid sets of in the indicated direction. In compliance with its orders, it does not engage in combat with any of the many lifeforms it meets on the way. Unless, of course, it would deem a situation hostile and thus be forced to defend itself. And for a droid with a heuristic processor (complete with a few software quirks), the definition of a "hostile situation" can be expanded upon greatly.
Keeping the blast chambers in its rifle loaded, the droid is ready to effectively put an end to any hostilities encountered along the way.

## Re: Colicoid Creation Nest Beta Test

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-24 02:51:28)

Thrax's trip is short and uneventful. As he rounds the corner the waypoint on his HUD flashes briefly and the massive building towards the end of the block takes on a greenish highlight, indicating that it was his destination. As he approaches he sees that the building is hexagonal, and its walls are roughly four meters tall. The entire block reverberates with the roaring of the crowds inside.
As the unit comes to the main entrance, a huge set of doors that judging by the dust have never been closed, a protocol unit greets it, **"Participant or spectator?"** The droid looks to be in good repair, with a fresh oil bath leaving his shell gleaming. Crowds flow in and out of the arena, indicating some matches ending and another group beginning.

---

## Re: Colicoid Creation Nest Beta Test

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-24 05:19:45)

The massive war droid comes to a halt in the entrance, and focuses his photoreceptors on the protocol droid, in a way that anyone who knows anything about droids would interpret as threatening. It´s vocabulator alters the pitch a bit, to replicate a human voice dripping with sarcasm.
**"Offended and Sarcastic Answer: Well of course this unit is here as a spectator. A powerful rifle is always needed to keep bugs away, and a vibroblade the size of a small humanoid baby is excellent to use as a sun shade. If only everyone else would stop wasting their items of similar quality inside the arena, where they might get even get hurt"**
Silently priming its his blaster rifle to eradicate the protocol unit, the command given by the Colocoid interrupted his action. Restraining himself, he started looping the notion of "reaching the arena" through his logical core, searching for ways to interpret himself as having reached the arena, and the protocol droid as hostile.

**"You will go far. Either as victor or scrap. From the port there you may download the regulations, or you may have them on datacard,"** the protocol droid responds as he turns and focuses on the wall, where a view screen comes to life displaying current openings in bouts. **"Here is what is available,"** it says as the list scrolls into view, showing the species and wager of each.
1. Wookie, bowcaster with mounted grenade launcher.
2. Duros, Mini-proton Torpedo Launcher (empty) + 2 frag grenades.
3. Trandoshan, Computerized Interface Scope.
**"What will be your wager? Which would you like?"** the protocol droid asks.

## Re: Colicoid Creation Nest Beta Test

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-24 06:54:22)

The battle droid raised its left arm, showing up the rifle attached under it, indicating it as his wager. Turning his attention to the screen, it takes only a few seconds before dormant protocols from his original programming activates, and the decision is made just as fast.
**"Eager Declaration: This unit was built and designed to hunt Wookies, and its capabilities has yet to be put to the test. Just provide directions"**
Priming its combat protocols and bringing up data files on Wookie battle tactics, A-88 prepared for battle.

## Re: Colicoid Creation Nest Beta Test

### **Magical2099** (2010-08-24 07:52:27)

The protocol droid passes a scanner over the rifle and states, **"Your weapon emplacement will suffice. Pit one, through the doors on the left, end of the corridor. Most organics appreciate being wished good luck, but we both know luck is a figment of their fragile processing units,"** it says as one photoreceptor blinks on and off.
Thrax follows the directions easily, and through the door at the end of the corridor waits another droid, a basic and ancient B1 battle droid with a carbine and "Non-combatant" painted across his chest, who states, **"When the gates open, terminate opponent, then return here. The purse for this bout is 1500 credits, and the opponent's wager will be brought here afterwards,"** sounding like a recording. A second door is beyond the droid, which opens as he gestures towards it.
Through that door lies a small cage, whose gate opens onto a large open area with scattered obstructions ranging from barricades to short columns. Roughly two and a half meter walls surround the pit, which is open to the sky. Three rows of spectator seating can be seen above the wall, which is extended by a small transparent shield which hums with power.
((OOC Roll initiative once inside the cage. OOC))

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-08-24 11:10:46)

Protocols initiated, A-88 proceeds into the arena. As he enters the pit, and spots the crowd surrounding him, he takes a look around. Not seeing any signs of his opponent, he walks a few steps into the arena, and comes to a halt. Fueling maximum power into his rifle, he stands motionless as he engages his advanced targeting software, tracking any motions occurring around him.

**"WELCOME ONE, WELCOME ALL TO THE KILLEE-KOR ARENA!!!"** booms out from the speakers around the pit, broadcasted in multiple languages including binary.
**"THIS HOUR WE HAVE A WOOKIE VERSUS A DROID!!! WE'LL TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE WINNER AFTER THE FIGHT IS DONE, BOTH ARE NEWCOMERS, AND ONE WON'T BE LEAVING THIS PIT ALIVE OR OPERATIONAL!!! THE OTHER WILL BE BEGINNING A HOPEFULLY GLORIOUS ARENA CAREER!!! LET THE BATTLE BEGIN!!!"** the announcer booms, and the cage doors open.
Across the pit, Thrax can see a Wookie buck, hefting a bowcaster with his head thrown back indicating a Wookie roar which can't be heard over the crowd and announcer. The Wookie spots you, and lifts his bowcaster to his shoulder. A shot lashes out towards the prototype unit, but splashes harmlessly into the wall on its left. The Wook howls and rushes to Thrax's right, taking cover behind a pillar.

The massive battle droid turns its head slightly as the bowcaster bolt dig into the wall next to it. Not impressed by the marksmanship of his opponent, A-88 bend his left elbow to point the rifle mount towards his target.
**"Statement: Primary target acquired. Activating combat protocols. Optimized strategy: Frontal assault"**
Distance assessments, wind calculations, and a mass of other data races through the droids processor core as it picks up on the Wookie. A brilliant fireball forming at its muzzle, the Bryar Rifle discharges a deadly payload towards the pillar behind which the Wookie is hiding. Picking up speed, the metallic feet clanks against the ground as A-88 moves to close the distance to his foe.

The over-charged blast impacts the pillar the Wook hides behind, throwing chips of stone in every direction. The Wookie leans out and grasps the grenade launcher hanging under his bowcaster. He points it in A-88's path and squeezes the trigger. Thrax's photoreceptors track the small projectile directly to his own feet, far too quickly to dodge. His optical flash suppressors kick in automatically, keeping him from being blinded by the explosion. The blast scores the unit's plating with debris and lodges a large chunk into one of his knee servos, but fails to knock him from his feet.

Rocked from the heavy impact of the grenade explosion, the battle droid doesn´t slow down it´s pace as it moves up towards the rubble in the middle of the arena. Kneeling down behind a large, cracked duracrete block, he lines up his rifle, supporting it with his other hand, and fires again. Moving to the side a bit, he tries to get into an advantageous position for drawing his prey out. Preparing for a swift downing of his foe, he charges up his rifle again.

The Wook watches as his droid opponent runs for cover, ducking and cowering behind a fallen column. Thrax hears his enemy **"Wuf huf-huf-huf-huf,"** laughing at his hiding place. The beast stays still, carefully lining up his shot, which misses horribly, impacting the ground a good six meters in front of A-88. The beast roars in frustration before ducking back behind his column...

If his facial features hadn´t been set in stone (or rather, metal), a leer would probably have shown on the battle droids exterior head plate as his opponents shot missed by far. Standing up to his full length, A-88 aligned his rifle forward, and another overcharged blaster bolt streaked forward towards the Wookie and his hiding place.
Keeping the weapon trained towards the pillar, the battle droid moved in a strafing motion, taking him out of his foes line of sight. Finding another half-broken piece of rubble to take cover behind, he checked the power level of his rifle. Satisfied with the result, he adjusted his focus back towards his opponent.

The Wook watches the droid stand and ducks back long before the blast tears another hole in the column he hides behind. As Thrax leaves his line of view he breaks from his position and runs to his right, crossing to the next column, trying to find a line of sight on his opponent.
The crowd hasn't made its presence known yet, and a brief glance to the stands shows them emptying slowly, unimpressed with the competition so far. As the hairy warrior roadie runs to yet more cover a crescendo of boos can be heard, but they seem half-hearted.

Glad to have managed to draw the Wookie out of its hiding place, A-88 decides to make a change in strategy. Lowering his rifle to his side, the battle droid takes off in a sprint, heading towards the same column that his opponent has sought new shelter behind. Unable to clearly see his opponent, he still knows it is on the other side of the column, and he presses his metallic back against the structure.
He raises up his right arm, the vicious vibroblade gleaming in the sunlight, and holds it in a horizontal pose, ready to lash out with full power the moment his sensors picks up movement around the corner.

As Thrax leans against the column he dials up the sensitivity on his audio receptors only to find the effort wasted as his photo receptors catch the beast on the move again. The Wook hustles to put some distance between them and find a clear line of fire. He gets the line of fire and in his haste the shot goes wide, missing Thrax's metal chest by millimeters. The Wookie roars in frustration yet again, furious at his inability to down the droid before him...

His chest plate heating up a bit as the bowcaster bolt glances it, the battle droid diverts additional power to its leg servos, dashing forward in a semi-crouched fashion. As he approaches the Wookie, he shifts the balance of his body a bit the his right leg and pushes away. Leading with his left hand, he attempts to knock his opponents weapon out of the way, and following close behind is the vibroblade, going straight for the belly of the beast.
At this close range, his sensors are working overtime, doing what they can to assess every possible weakness of the Wookie, analyzing skeletal fractures, scanning for open wounds, and locating vital organs. One way or the other, this battle will be over soon.

The Wook proves exceptionally agile, sidestepping the droid's thrust. As the two close the crowd perks up a bit, and meager cheering can be heard off to Thrax's left.
The crafty beast backpedals slowly, leaving no opening for an attack. After gaining some breathing room he fire his bowcaster again, and his tenacity finally pays off as the bolt strikes the droid's mid-section, severely jarring internal systems and punching a small hole in his plating. The incredibly sturdy unit keeps standing despite the damage though, and his cold dead eyes track the Wookie's movements. As sparks fly from the blow, true cheering can be heard, albeit fitfully, from all sides of the Arena...

---Chassis breach detected, activating restoration protocols---
The massive battle droid rocked visibly when the bowcaster bolt drove deep into its midsection. He could feel power sapping away from a broken generator coupling, and noticed that the shot had not taken far from his main generator. His outer chassis shivered a bit as the backup generators kicked in, and he raised the Bryar towards his foe. The Wookie might have gotten a few lucky shots in, but the battle droid was far from defeated. Releasing a brilliant fireball from his weapon, the droid cut into an intersecting path, hoping to maneuver his opponent towards the closest piece of cover. Cowardly as he was, A-88 had no doubt the Wookie would head for cover.

A-88's logistical data and predictive software proves correct as the wily Wook backpedals to the available cover. The software doesn't predict the well placed shot that follows, though, as the droid feels the impact of another high velocity bowcaster bolt strike his shoulder. Were it not for his internal stabilizers he may have been turned 180 degrees or more before falling, but his Colicoid engineering holds and keeps him upright. The crowd has become almost interested in the fight now, with scattered chatter and mild applause at the fresh sparks flying from the droid's tortured chassis.

The second bolts rocks the droid even harder than the first, and much to his frustration, his opponent keeps eluding him. Where most warriors might have found a tactical retreat appropriate, A-88 has long since made a complete mess of any such logics in his programming. Instead, the droid takes aim and fires again at his opponent, diverting all his internal power sources now to offense, to try and simply overwhelm his opponent.

Thrax is rewarded with a howl of pain as his fire finally finds its mark. The Wook's cry of pain soon turns into a roar as he flies into a rage brought on by injury and the weakness he sees in his opponent. The beast leaves the protection of the column and charges the droid, massive hairy arm swinging wildly and crashing into the droid's neck. A-88's reaction protocols show their merit as his blade arm lashes out, removing the beast's head in one simple cut. The crowd roars at the result of the fight, brought to life by the spray of blood and the toppling tower of raging beast.
The announcer's voice rings out once again from the speakers around the arena, **"AND WE HAVE A WINNER! THIS SCRAPPY DROID BARELY AVOIDED BEING SCRAPPED, BUT HE DID! NOW WE'LL FIND OUT THIS DROID DESIGNATION…"**
The B-1 battle droid that let Thrax into the arena approaches, and says, **"Please state your unit designation,"** and holds a comlink up towards A-88's vocoder. Over by the column A-88 can see another ancient battle droid hefting the dropped bowcaster and making his way over...

As the immediate primary objective has been neutralized, and no other apparent threats are found, the battle droid´s systems either powers down or goes into standby. It seem his assesment of the temper of his opponent was correct, but unfortunately that seems to be the only thing that saved the day. Clearly, several of his targeting routines are in less than optimal shape, and now his hull has also suffered from substantial injury. He would need to have a thorough talk with his masters about this suboptimal performance, as there isn´t really anyone to blame but them. A new model, A-88 has hardly been able to gather enough heuristics and data to improve significantly, and had only his basic programming to act upon.
As the B-1 approaches, the battle droid watches him warily. As the other holds up a comlink towards A-88, a software safeguard kicks in, and power begins to surge back to his motoric servos.
**"Statement: This unit cannot reveal sensitive model information. In fact, this unit is detecting hostile behaviour from nearby unit. Engaging security protocol to protect sensitive information"**
In a quick motion, the droid thrusts its massive vibroblade forward, driving it straight through the chest of the B-1, and then rapidly retracts the blade and decapitates the smaller droid with a single overhead swing. Standing motionless for a few seconds, he starts to move towards the exit of the arena, collecting his winnings on the way out.

Off behind him several more come in with carbines shouldered. **"LEAVE THE ARENA, SCRAPPY THE DROID, AND I WOULD ADVISE NOT HARMING ANYMORE ARENA PROPERTY, LEST YOU FIND YOURSELF BANNED AND OR SCRAPPED."** the announcer booms. As the droid exits the pit he notices that the hallways which were quite crowded earlier empty quickly. His stroll out is unimpeded.

*Scrappy the Droid? Was that the best that underdeveloped processor could com up with?*
A-88 doesn´t mind his new "designation" in the arena though. He couldn´t care less what he was called, though it might trick a few opponents into thinking him some sort of joke. In that case, the joke would be one them. But first things first, he had a few things to share with his Colicoid masters. As he walks back towards their headquarters, he notes that the crowd was not as simpleminded as he had thought. He had suspected that the simple act of beheading the droid in the arena would send them into an uproar, thogh apparently something more was required.
Reaching the headquarters, the droids moves inside, closing the door behind him and looks around for the technicians.

As Thrax reaches the warehouse of his makers he finds the door locked. As he tries to engage it a pop-up appears in his HUD outlining his mission parameters.

* Participate in the Arena
* Use winnings as necessary to continue participating
* Data is collected remotely on performance

On seeing the last entry, Thrax begins analyzing his internal systems and discovers he is indeed broadcasting an encrypted signal. The traffic is one way only, and seems well designed due to the relatively small packet size and infrequency of transmission.

*Cowardly bugs…*
The battle droid wasn´t sure if the Colicoid had seen his performance in the arena, but he doubted it. Those smug technicians would not have missed an opportunity to gloat about his lack of performance. Which in turn might have lead to...unpleasantries, forcing the CCN to deploy some new representatvies. But it seemed like he was on his own now, and it would be up to him to improve his performance and conquer the arena. The on-site assistance of the CCN would have been appreciated, but he would manage anyway. He already knew where to start.
Leaving the warehouse, he went through the list of things to be done. His first order of business was to find a mechanics shop that could fix the damage that the Wookie had caused in his outer chassis. Second, he needed to find an arms dealer where he could unload the weapon he had won from his opponent, as well as acquire some new armament to complement the flaws in his current arsenal. Third, he would need to try and locate if there were any specialized droid facilities in the area, that he might employ for repairs, upgrades and modifications in the future. And fourth, he would try to localize the resident tech wiz, as he figured it would prove invaluable to have access to a person that could give that slight edge to his weapons and equipment.
((
To break it down for you:

[1]Find someone to repair HP
[2]Find a good dealer of weapons
[3]Find someone who can assist with modifications, getting new droid systems, and so on
[4]Find someone with the Tech Specialist/Superior tech feats

After querying several information kiosks A-88 discovers that the south-east area of the city is known as the 'Droid Quarter.' Specifically the area between Tier 6's Arena 3 and 4. There all manner of droid mechanics, parts, specialists, and even other droids, both independent and for sale, can be found there. It takes the combat unit roughly seven hours to locate the information due to its poor threat assessment programming and overly aggressive combat routines. At the end of his wanderings (or rampage, according to the locals) he scares the owner of a kiosk away and decides to utilize the abandoned resource for his needs. After gathering the info on the Droid Quarter he runs a basic search on weapons dealers and finds that they may be the most common business in the city, with several being located in the Quarter itself.

Settling into his newly "acquired" locale, the battle droid figured this section of the city would be a good place to center his activities in. Though he still had the more pressing issue of getting some much needed repairs. Locating a local mechanics shop run by another droid, A-88 decides to head over there. Hopefully he will be able to establish some sort of functioning relationship, as he suspected this would not be the last time he would be in need of repairs. Adding improved armor coverage and a deflector shield generator to his list of suitable systems upgrades, he leaves for the located destination.
Realizing that he had orders not to engage targets outside of the arena, he makes a note of designating the city, or at least the Droid Quarter, as a low-threat area.

As he enters the Droid Quarter he sees very few organics. The largest majority of the organics seem to be Jawas and other small mechanically minded species with a scattering of Squib and Verpine here and there. The shear amount of other droids on the other hand is staggering. It takes A-88 no time to find a droid owned and operated shop since they are plentiful in this area. On attempting to enter a flying remote approaches and sends out a burst of binary, **"01100001 01101100 01101100 00100000 01110111 01100101 01100001 01110000 01101111 01101110 01110011 00100000 01101101 01110101 01110011 01110100 00100000 01100010 01100101 00100000 01110000 01101111 01110111 01100101 01110010 01100101 01100100 00100000 01100100 01101111 01110111 01101110 00100000 01100010 01100101 01100110 01101111 01110010 01100101 00100000 01100101 01101110 01110100 01100101 01110010 01101001 01101110 01100111,"** which repeats constantly as it hovers overhead.

Nodding slightly, A-88 drains the power from his rifle and he never even had the vibroblade powered up. It would still function like a regular blade, but this was supposed to be a non-hostile appearance. He recognizes the other droid as a LE series droid, and he figures it could help him.
**"Statement: Understood, powering down"**
He waits a few moments to make sure the little remote is able to register the lack of power in his weapons.
**"Query: This unit is looking for a facility that can take care of external hull damage sustained in combat, and if possible establish a working arrangement for future similar requests no doubt coming from participating in gladiatorial combat.

The small remote buzzes away to one of a series of hidey holes scattered around the seemingly ramshackle shop.
**"LE-23 or Leak if you like. My services are one hundred credits an hour. Protection at this moment is unneeded. Profits, on the other hand, are always welcome. My subroutines are the most advanced available you may check my references and statistical data if you like,"** Leak responds as he goes back to torquing down the neck bolts of the ASP labor droid in front of him.

Four hours later A-88 finds himself booted and in perfect repair. Checking over the work he finds it to be flawless and his internal clock shows the elapsed time at 3.76 hours. As Leak closes the outer hatch of Thrax's chest he tells him, **"Done. I always charge whole hours only. 400 credits, due upon completion, which is now.

A-88 devotes some time to the recharge station and oil bath, even though such things are known to have less effect of the robust construction of battle droids, and more a luxury for less sturdy desgins. Upon exiting the oil bath though, he feels rather refreshed, as if coming straight from the production line. He heads back out into the shop, finding Leak working on something mechanical beyond his understanding. Though that is not hard to understand, since his systems only contains the most rudimentary files regarding mechanical constructions.
**Statement: This droid feels renewed and ready for battle. Thank you for your help, it is likely we will meet again. Don´t hesitate to make contact with this unit in case you need something extreminated**
He heads out of the ship, starting to localize an arms dealer suitable for his purposes. Optimally, he would visit a droid dealer, but what he had in mind required the more personal touch of some of the most notorious weapons manufacturers in the Galaxy: the Baragwin. Outlawed in most places, the droid hoped that a location such as this might not be as strcit on weapon regulations. As he walked through the city, he produced the files for the particular piece of equipment he was looking for: the Merr-Sonn PLX-2M portable missile launcher.
((
If possible I´d like someone who can sell it to me with the Baragwin template on it, even though it places it just outside my price range, though I figure some negotiations can take place.

Not terribly far from Leak's shop Thrax finds a Verpine weaponsmith. The Verpine's droid guards say nothing about A-88's weaponry as he wanders in, and with good reason. A-88 can see some classic battle droid designs amongst his guard, including other CCN models like the Droideka.
From behind a workbench that serves double duty as a counter a spindly Verpine calls out, **"Welcome to Zraii Zex's Weapons Depot. Hmmm. A humanoid CCN model. Never thought I would see one in production. What were you built to kill I wonder? Doesn't matter really, except when it comes time to pick the weapons load-out, eh? Heh! What can I help you with?"**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-10-08 11:46:08)

A-88 walked into the shop, and he was impressed at the sight of the security force the Verpine had amassed. He was particularly fond of seeing the Droideka present, not just because he felt some amount of kinship with it, but mainly because it was impressivge how it could remain a potent war design this far after its original creation. Looking around, he made a quick inspection of the varied droid force, scanning to see what kind of supply this establishment might hold.
**"Statement: This unit is in need of some heavy armament to efficiate the process of arena fighting. In particular, a MerrSonn PLX-2M would probably do the trick"**
He overwievs the systems file for the item in particular, noting its unique qualities.

**"Yes, I have one, and yes they come with those capabilities from the factory. Three thousand credits and its yours. I'll have to give my YVH a new toy, but he'll get over it,"** as the Verpine replies Thrax notices that while it speaks, what the unit hears is far different and coming from another location. A-88 notices a small speaker mounted on the workbench, and after seeing his photo-receptors focusing on it the Verpine says, **"Yes, what you are hearing isn't actually me. Most species, and even some droids, find my kind's speech habits annoying and hard to follow. I bought a translator unit and built myself a personal translator. So far the programming is proving adequate."**

## Re: Colicoid Creation Nest Beta Test

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-10-11 11:58:28)

After a quick scan, A-88 realizes that the Verpine is somewhat overcharging the price, at least according to Galactic standards. Unfortunately, with all the security in place, he wasn´t likely to be susceptible to any aggressive bartering, and friendly negotiations was not something the CCN had had in mind when they made his programming. Still he figured the Verpine might be hoping for an easy sell to someone who didn´t know proper pricing. He figured two could play at that game.
**"Statement: That amount of credits is unavailable at the time, though this unit has a proposal"**
He reached bahind his back and produced the bowcaster he had won in his previous match.
**"Proposal: In exchange for this unit, valued at approximately 2000 credits, you will install the launcher onto the prepared mount on this units shoulder.

The Verpine's antenna twitch violently at the bowcaster. After a few seconds spent chittering to itself the translator speaks, **"Ha! A CCN droid that can negotiate! I like that, its rich,"** it exclaims before continuing. **"Unfortunately, that unit is used. It even still has blood on it. I will give a total of one thousand for it in trade, 750 in cash.

He held up the bowcaster in front of the Verpine.
**"Assessment: Despite being rather bloody, this piece of ordnance is in prime condition, and also customized to double as a grenade launcher.

A-88 was not the kind of droid who liked to mimic the behaviour of organics, though his behavorial routines informed him that an audible sight had been rather appropriate at the moment. A quick calculation revealed that even with the improved offer, he would still be about 100 credits short. Hopefully, he had impressed the Verpine enough that he´d be willing to let it slide.
**"Reluctant Acknowledgement: While the presented offer is reasonable, this unit is unfortunately short of the requested amount by 100 credits"**
He looked over at the YVH carrying the piece of armament. Yes, that would very well suffice. The heat-seeking sensors of the weapon, and the high yield of the payload would make sure his next opponent could not hide like cowardly Wookie had done, but would force them to fight on his terms.

The work is quickly done and the credit transfer even quicker, and the speed with which the Verpine dismantles the bowcaster frightening.

This is why i was suggesting something cheaper, like a base missile launcher. Weapons don't come with loaded clips. This is what I meant by 'how are you going to load the thing?'

With the new weapon installed, A-88 rose to his feet again, felling somewhat unbalanced by the added weight. He might have to try and remedy that later, but for now it seemed like his gyroscopic stabilizers could handle it. He performed a few simple slashes and thrusts with the vibroblade on his right arm, and raised his rifle into a firing position. It seemed like the Verpine had done a good job. He turned back to the Verpine, and aimed his newly installed weapon´s heat sensors for the insectoid, just to familiarize him with the interface.

Thrax finds himself with enough time to recalibrate his settings several times as he waits, and while doing so the protocol droid that granted him entrance in his first bout approaches.
**"Scrappy the Droid, you left earlier without your Arena Badge. Here, it will allow access to the Arena Net,"** it says as it offers the badge and points towards a data terminal. **"We also offer Arena-Pads, which grant wireless connectivity to the Net for a small fee."**
As the protocol droid finishes speaking YVH-28 approaches with his own new weapons load out. On his forearm is mounted the grenade launcher from the bowcaster, and in his hands is an odd looking weapon that appears to be a form of projectile weapon, similar to a bowcaster but lacking the bulk and size.
**"Our match waits. Our opponents are a sub-species of Womp Rat. Battleground designation: Pit 2."**
As A-88 follows the towering skeletal droid into the cage after the same speech from an almost identical B-1 he gets his first glimpse of Pit 2 as the cage rises into the pit proper. He finds himself in a deep hole, with stairs at either end and alcoves along the way to either stair. The wall that makes the alcoves is as tall as the sides of the pit, easily six meters.
**"COME ONE, COME ALL, TO THE KILLEE-KOR ARENA!!! TONIGHT WE HAVE YVH-28 AND SCRAPPY THE DROID AGAINST THE WOMP HORDE!!! LET'S SEE IF THESE TWO DROIDS CAN SUCCEED WHERE SO MANY HAVE FALLEN TO THE FLOOD!!! PLACE YOUR BETS AND LET THE BATTLE BEGIN!!!"** the announcer's voice booms as the cage opens. After the noise dies a bit, A-88 can hear as sound like thousands of tiny percussions against stone, rolling like thunder towards the hole he is standing in.

A-88 takes the badge from the droid and stowes it inside his internal storage compartments. He wasn´t certain what he´d need it for, he had managed to get around well enough even without it, hadn´t he? As he steps into the cage with the YVH droid, he scans the droid for armaments.
**"Request: State primary armament and tactics programming for this unit to facilitate optimal battle strategy"**
As the cage rises into the arena, A-88 scans the surroundings, mapping it out as best as he could, searching for key points of optimal defensibility and vantage. A quick measure showed that the two alcoves that flanked the pit they had risen out of constituted well-guarded positions, that would allow them to funnel their opposition against them in a single file. Of course, were they to be overrun, they would be in serious trouble. A small humming sound was heard as his vibroblade engaged its power cell, and mechanical sounds suggested a missile was loaded into his newly installed launcher.
At the sound of approaching opponents, A-88 wondered if they were in fact up against a greatly superior number of enemies, or if their foes were in possession of more limbs than normal, which would hint at a more reasonable number of opposition. Without turning his head around, he spoke to his newfound ally.
**"Observation: Optimal choice of armament is likely high-yield explosives or blaster weapons capable of automatic fire. Best tactical location for defense: The top of the walls surrounding this pit.
Statement: This unit suggests we take up a defensive position at the middle of either stairway, at a height such that out opponent cannot reach us. That way we need only face opposition on one front, and should we be overrun we can abandon our position without sustaining serious injuries"**
Raising his rifle so that it was held straight forward, A-88 begins to move along the base of the wall to his side, halting as he reached about halfway up the staircase. He took a quick assessment of the height above the ground, trying to measure whether anyone standing on the ground next to the stairs would be able to reach him.
((
I´ll start at point a1, and use two Move actions to get to the middle of the left stairs. I should be able to get 2 squares up on it if I calculates correctly. The Swift action I´ll use to prime the Bryar Rifle.

**"Grenades, high output blaster array, magna-caster, custom tactical software based on original Terandro Arms version 7.2,"** the YVH replies as it exits the cage opposite A-88. Shortly the skeletal droid is out of Thrax's sight, and as Thrax takes the stairs the noise he heard becomes deafening, and he finds himself forced to dial down his audial inputs. His position on the stairs allows him to view the rest of the arena floor, it being at eye level for him. He sees thousands upon thousands of small fury bodies swarming across the pit like a living carpet, moving full speed for the trench he and his ally began in. A thunder is heard behind him, and turning he sees blood and fur flying from a crater in the living carpet, obviously the result of a grenade impact.

Seeing the huge mass of womp rats swarm in, and sensors registering even more flooding the arena, A-88 was glad the Verpine had agreed to arm him properly. Plating one foot in front of his other to steady himself, the droid fed one missile into the chamber of the PLX 2-M. The little pests were everywhere, but the weapon´s heat-seeking systems locked on the biggest cluster of them, and the highly explosive payload soared from his left shoulder at high speed. A quick notion flashed through his mind as to whether he would be liable for any destruction of the arena. He figured he wouldn´t worry about it though, since after all, he had been let into the arena with a missile launcher. What did they expect?
The missile detonated at near point blank range, and as the shock- and heatwave came rushing over him, the battle droid saw that it was accompanied by blood, fur and guts. As his robust chassis and heat-resilient plating absorbed most of the shock, A-88 fed more power into both his rifle and blade, walking purposefully down the stairs to finish of whatever critters remained. Upping his vocabulators volume to be heard over the sound of the battle, he called out for his partner.

As he tops the stairs and moves towards the south of the pit he finds the true gravity of his situation much worse than he first thought. His optics focus on the smaller organisms and the 'Horde' part makes sense as his processor begins to overheat trying to enumerate all the creatures in the pit. YVH's comment on 'sub species' makes sense also. While the typical Womp Rat measures a few meters the masses before him vary in size from blaster pistols to credit chips and smaller. The floor beneath them is hidden by their mass, and it seems almost as a wave of tissue that crashes against him. He struggles against them but quickly comes to the conclusion that they can't be killed. There are simply too many. They can only be endured. As he swings and swipes and fires at them they swarm him, scuttling up his vibro-blade and legs, covering his optic sensors and audial receptors. A-88 finds himself effectively blinded, with only a vague idea of YVH's location, and the location of the normal size Womp Rats. His feet become unsteady in the flood of fur, and he finds himself stumbling as his internal damage assessing software begins to scream for attention. It registers dozens of tiny breaches, scattered all across his frame.
((OOC
Okay, the other half of the threat is revealed. Five packs of actual womp rats would be a bit much for 2 level one droids, but five very nerfed packs and a hazard makes an interesting challenge. The smaller ones are so numerous they can't be dealt with, and they can't really pose a challenge. They are a hazard. While in them, all terrain is treated as difficult, and once per round they make an attack VS Fortitude. On a hit, a target takes 1d6 damage and is blinded (all targets gain concealment), on a miss, the target takes half damage and is not blinded. The hazard moves with a speed of 2 squares per round. It will last a specific number of rounds (no, I'm not telling you :P ).

*They weren´t kidding when they called these things the Flood…*
A-88 finds himself in a literal swarm of the furry creatures, and the fact that his missile attack had reduced a large mass of them to smoking pieces of flesh, there just seems to be no end to them. Having momentarily lost contact with his companion, the battle droid quickly revises his situation. Though the furry little pests covers several of his sensory inputs, his orientation seems to be working, and he tries to move for free ground. As he moves, he hacks and slashes with his vibroblade around him, and twists and spins his body in an effort to get rid of the critters clinging to him.
Once he clears the worst cluster of rats, he calls upon his registered layout of the arena, and heads forward towards the pillar in front of him, where he takes up temporary shelter.

As Thrax stumbles to his left, remembering open areas in that direction, he finds movement difficult. The constantly moving Womp sub-species underfoot threatens to trip him at every step. As he breaks free of them, his cold steel fingers scrape the last of them from his optics and he rushes for the column in the center of the room. As he nears it, one of the few packs remaining flows around the column, crashing into him in a wave of flesh much heavier than the one he just left. He lands on his back and slides, his metal shoulders scraping to a stop with his head hanging over the edge. As he begins to pick himself up he looks down, seeing the pit through which the cage that delivered him and his partner had risen. The drop looks to be over a hundred meters, easily fatal. A look to his left shows his partner moving towards open ground as well, with the other remaining pack of normal rats hot on his heels. A-88 can also see the Horde moving inexorably forward...

Shoved and pushed around by the mass of small critters, A-88 found his odds likely getting worse with every moment, as control of the fight slipped away from him. Spotting his seemingly lost ally though, balanced the calculations somewhat back in his favor. Organic beings might have called it "hope". Not that giving up was an existing parameter in his processing core, he would fight until he was nothing more than shrapnel. However, certain parameters in his programming based the...desperation in suggested actions on his odds for success, and so he might just have skipped over a potentially suicidal maneuver as the YV came back in sight.
Moving away from the pit behind him, and keeping his back towards the wall, the battle droid readied another missile charge, and as he approached the area filled with the smaller rats that were more annoying than truly dangerous, he let it rip, and once again his thermal sensors went haywire for a moment as the heat wave rushed over his exterior shell. As his sensory accuracy returned though, he noticed the massive crater on the other side of the rat swarm. Apparently these little pests making it really difficult for both heat- and gravity-guided targeting systems to aim.

His systems begin orienting themselves just as the nuisance ratlings over run him, made easier by his prone state. He finds himself blind yet again.

With systems reorienting themselves, the battle droid scrambled into an upright position again, the critters falling of him in clusters. With scanners indicating an increased amount of the little pests, he raises his left hand into the air, using heuristic data to aim at a probable location of the largest cluster of the enemy: The ledge he just fell off. Deriving what excess power he can spare into the blast chamber of his rifle, he releases a duracrete-shattering blast as he slowly backs away from the wall.

---Sensory capacity compromised, proximity alarms activated---

Finding himself in much more of a predicament he hadn´t really anticipated, primarily caused by those pestering little rats messing up pretty much any sensory systems he had, the battle droid found himself pretty literally backed into a corner. With the enemy swarming close to him, he found his systems warning him that setting off a missile charge would most likely cause him to be caught partially in the blast. Still, it was the best opportunity he would have to wipe out the rats as they were pressing through the stairway.
Disregarding the internal safety of the weapon, he fed another high-yield missile into the launcher and fired it at point blank range right into the flood of fur merely meters in front of him, all the while bracing himself against the blast of the impact, hoping his heat-resistant armor would be able to absorb the bulk of it.

A-88 takes a reasonable risk firing his payload in such close quarters and thanks to a squishy rodent underfoot at the wrong moment, throwing his aim off horribly, his missile goes screaming into the air, almost straight up, where it impacts the ceiling of the Arena and draws a thunderous applause from the crowd. His brief respite from the larger rats is quickly over though, as the pack separates and swarms around him, filling every nook and cranny. On the positive side, their bulk can no longer batter him about; unfortunately, he now finds himself surrounded by notorious pack hunters. The seriousness of the situation becomes readily apparent as they clasp at his limbs, trying to forcibly bring him to ground where more of their brethren can pile on top of him...

Feeling the resistance of one rat sliding of his blade, the battle droid cursed the targeting systems inability to lock on to the small pests, and was thankful for his internal stabilizers, because without them he´d have tripped over the little rodents on multiple occasions. Still finding himself in a far less than optimal situation, he was far from ready for the scrapheap just yet.
Activating all backup generators on full, he primed another missile into the launcher - well aware that the clip was running out - and sent it hurling straight into the furry devils ahead of him. All internal safeties disabled, he didn´t care about the proximity damage, all he cared about was to squash every Womp Rat to nothing but blooidied fur.

Sitting up from his prone position, the battle droid took a few moments to look around, recalibrate his sensors, and run a full diagnostic on his basic systems. Everything seemed to be in working order, but as had been mentioned by Leak, he noticed several setdowns in functionality and estimated his operational capacity to somewhere around 40-45%. Immediately he began a recollection of his memory banks from the previous battle, initiating a thorough analysis to determine where things had gone wrong.
As his photoreceptors settled into an acceptable focus, he turned to look at Leak and YVH-28.
**"Statement: With operational capacity severely decimated, this unit would be most appreciative if further repairs could be made to restore it to optimal battle capacity.

The battle droids looks over the list of possible candidates. While it did seem that the reward would be greatest if he bested the YVH droid, he knew the capacity of the model. he had taken quite a beating in the last match, and even though all diagnostics showed positive, he wouldn´t know for sure if his capacity had been fully restored until he had tested it in the arena. He thought about accessing the arena net in search of alternative opponents, when he saw that one of the possible candidates in this arena were a crew of Jawa.
While he had no real experience with the species, he did know of their reputation as scavengers and poachers of stray droids. From what he had learned, they were keen on assaulting droids, disabling them, equipping them with a restraining bolt and then selling them off as property. He had also heard of their tendency to use Ion weaponry, and even though it was on his list of modifications to make, he had yet to acquire some sort of ion isolation. Still, his construction had proven to be very sturdy in the past, and he figured it would be a great way to see how good Leak really was with repairs.
**"Statement: This unit would like to take the opportunity to strike back for the abduction of numerous droids committed by the Jawa species.

As his sensors takes in the layout of the new arena, A-88 centers on the two small figures at the far end of the pit. His databanks contained very little detailed information about Jawa, but simple deduction told him that with such small statures they were likely to have substandard movement speeds compared to most normal-sized humanoids.
Taking in the various possibilities for cover and protection that this particular pit offered, he estimated that his opposition would be unable to reach them before he could fire a shot. Activating the full range of his sensor array, he locked on to one of the two small figures, and began to feed additional power into the enlarged blast chamber of his rifle.

Thrax's simple deduction proves wrong as the Jawa on his left takes off in a sprint, easily reaching the shield and getting behind it. Thrax can still see the small beast, though the shield distorts vision somewhat. The second Jawa scrambles forward, raising a large pistol with stock to his shoulder, looking proportionate to a heavy blaster rifle on the small creature. The shot misses horribly at this range, but the distinctive blue crackle of an Ion blast shows A-88 that this Jawa wields a weapon presenting a serious threat to him.

Not at all surprised at the appearance of an Ion weapon on the scene, the battle droid nevertheless noted the heightened threat level among his heuristic parameters. He would eventually have to seek out someone to make sure his systems were completely isolated, but for now, his calculations rated the odds of his victory as very high indeed. He was confident that his superior combat training routines would outweigh any advantage the Jawas could reasonably gain from their specialized weaponry.
While one of the opponents had exceeded his expectations and taken a sprint for cover, his companion had not been as cunning. Whatever the small creature had possibly been able to gain by attacking while in such a vulnerable spot, was indeed lost by the fact that he had missed his shot. All it did now was to leave him in just that...a vulnerable spot. As his systems locked on to his opponent, he raised his rifle-equipped left arm, and started to move forward. As the power buildup in the blast chamber reached critical levels, the weapon discharged, and immediately he started to feed more power into the weapon.

The Jawa that fired looks slightly bewildered as A-88's shot impacts the wall meters to his right, then hustles to capitalize on the error by finding cover against the barricade in the center of the room on their side. The first Jawa moves along side his brother, laying his blaster across the barricade and firing on the war-droid. The weaker ion blast catches the droid, sending blue lightning down his frame and into the ground. The crowd makes itself heard at the first contact. His circuits singed, Thrax can see both his targets crouched behind cover, jabbering amongst themselves.

If one of those CCN techs ever dared to show themselves in his presence again, A-88 would have a lot of things to say to them about delivering a finished product. Not being able to compensate target triangulation for differences in target sizes was not acceptable. Luckily enough, they knew how to build sturdy chassis, and the ion blast that scratched off his armor plating was barely recognizable to him.
The miserable failure of his previous attack had allowed both his opponents to reach relative safety behind cover, and he pondered how to proceed. He was pretty certain a single blast from his missile launcher would eradicate both of his opponents, but at the same time he wasn´t sure how much he dared to rely on its targeting. His pwn targeting routines had proved flawed from time to time, and he doubted that the interaction between the PLX and that system would go as smooth as one could hope.
Relying on more proved technology, he fed gathered targeting data from his last shot into his targeting routines, and sent another blast soaring towards the covering Jawas.

Thrax's next shot at least goes between the two Jawas, making the small being on the droid's right jump slightly. Both level their pistols at the droid, one loosing a single shot, the other unloading a torrent of ion in the droid's general direction, lightly spattering the droid again. The crowd begins to make noise in earnest at the flood of fire despite its lack of effectiveness.

The battle droid didn´t budge as the Jawas attack splattered against his shell. So far everything held up, but he knew it was only a matter of time before one of his opponents scored a lucky hit. Still, he didn´t have the targeting optimization software that allowed for him to adjust his aim while walking. Still refining his targeting algorithm, the droid kept his weapon at a lower power grade as he fired again.

The war droid's shots creep dangerously close to the Jawa on his right. That Jawa begins to chatter fearfully and his brother admonishes him, gesturing at the offending droid rudely before returning fire. Thrax's target misses, but the shot comes close, while his gesticulating brother sends his shot high into the air, where it strikes a hovering camera droid recording the match.

Seeing the accuracy of his targeting algorithm improving, the battle droid decides to take the battle to the next level. While the Jawa are fortunately proving to be pretty bad shots, he will not rely on their failure to win this match.
Activating his most sophisticated targeting equipment, A-88 drops to one knee and engages his missile launcher. Taking an estimated aim a couple of meters behind the barrier the Jawa were using as cover, he engages the heat-seeking sensors of his weapon and fires.

The detonation sends bits of the Jawa on Thrax's right flying over the barricade towards him, and the entire Jawa on his left to the floor. As the lone whole Jawa stands it utters a forlorn cry and returns fire, seeing his brother dead and his own chances greatly diminished. His return fire strikes true, sending A-88's sensors into a brief feed-back loop and destabilizing his inner gyros momentarily.

Upon seeing the devastation bought about by his missile launcher, the battle droid estimated his chances for success to above 99,99%. Surprised at the sudden marksmanship of the lone surviving Jawa he found a brilliant ion bolt striking true into his chest plate. Luckily, as it shielded his energy core, that segment of his chassis was among the most reinforced, and apart from some minor static residue on his optical sensors, A-88 barely acknowledged the shot.
Powering down his launcher, he once again raised his rifle arm, and took aim at the Jawa. The little creature made for a slightly advanced target, but he had in fact enjoyed this opportunity to enhance and update his targeting routines. Especially as it had provided him with minimal risks. Estimating the chance for this to be the final shot in the match to more than 50%, he fed more power into his rifle and fired.

The tiny Jawa's head evaporates and the crowd roars, pleased with A-88's performance, possibly for the first time. The announcer congratulates Scrappy the Droid once again, and on exiting the gate attendant pays Thrax the purse of two-thousand, five hundred credits, and gives him instructions for obtaining his wager at the front desk. Upon arrival, the smarmy protocol droid is waiting with the two pit droids, saying **"This is your new master, little ones. This unit has killed your former masters, and should serve adequately as a provider and protector."** It turns back to Thrax, **"Good show. You have a bit of Jawa on your chassis there,"** it says sounding smug and pointing to A-88's legs, which have some of the remains of the Jawa hit by the missile cooked on them. The two pit droids look around and spot Thrax, then shy back a bit, beeping nervously between themselves.
**"I left the restraining bolts on, deciding to leave that decision to you,"** the protocol droid says, holding out the controller to Thrax.

Powering down his weapons systems and leaving the arena, the battle droid listens to the cheers of the audience around him. He would most likely never understand what enjoyed these organics. But still, the function that raised their spirits seemed to be directly linear to the amount of blood and gore shown in a match. Still, he didn´t dwell too much on it, he had not come to the arena to please them. He had come to fight, and he had come to win.
Accepting his price money, he scanned over the two small droids that was brought before him. Pit droids, not in the perfect shape perhaps, but he hoped they could serve the purpose for which he had wanted to acquire them. He accepted the controller from the other droid, and locked it away in his internal storage compartments. At the mention of Jawa gore, he looked down to see what the other meant. Dismissing it as unimportant, he looked back at the other droid.
**"Observation: The sentient organics in this place seems to be easily impressed and aroused by the sight of mutilation and blood. Perhaps this unit should just leave it in place, as a favor to them. Or perhaps it will just remove it at the next timely oil bath"**
Beeping out a short string in Binary to the two pit droid, he commanded them to follow him as he set out for what had become a familiar stop for him since his arrival at the arena: Leak´s Workshop.

Thrax soon finds himself again harassed by the remote guardian of Leak's door, and after powering down weapons he finds Leak himself, hunched over the head of YVH-28, loading programing of some sort into his databanks through a thick cable attached to a portable computer.
**"Another success, war-droid? Very good. And these little ones? Your new mechanics?"** he asks A-88, beeping a greeting to the pit droids.

Reluctantly powering down his weapons, A-88 wondered if the guard at the door even realized that his vibroblade could most likely shred his internal parts even without power. And if it wasn´t for his growing fondness of the mechanic who owned the establishment, he might have demonstrated.
**"Statement: Yes, these are this units most recent acquisitions, formerly in the servitude of two recently deceased Jawa"**
Taking a moment to look around Leak´s shop, the battle droid observed YVH-28, apparently receiving some sort of upgrade.
**"Proposition: However, this unit have very little use for mechanics like these, especially as they are not in prime condition. As such, it would like to offer them as a gift, in exchange for the benefit of if not free, but at least reduced costs for repairs and modifications.

**"'Gift' is a very open ended word. I prefer to deal in exacting details to avoid unpleasantries arising from assumptions.

He runs a scanner across them and queries them on their capabilities, then turns back to A-88 with a counter-proposal. **"I will lease their services from you, they will perform the majority of the labor on you, saving you credits there.

Alright, the deal he's offering is: your repairs will take longer but you won't pay for labor, which will cut costs in half for you.

The battle droid´s processor works on the proposal for a few moments, and finds it acceptable.

Besides, it seemed to make a solid foundation for establishing an effective arrangement for restoring his abilities after each battle.
**"Agreement: This unit finds your proposal acceptable, and trusts that you will be satisfied as well"**
He takes out the controller for the Pit Droids restraining bolts and hands it to the other droid. Sending a quick burst of binary, explaining the situation to the two droids, he turns back to Leak.
**"Request: While the last battle did not result in much physical damage, this unit would like to request assistance with removing the residual effects of Ion weaponry.

Simply nodding as an acknowledgment, A-88 didn´t mind getting to experience first-hand the skills of his newly acquired companions. With expenses cut as much as possible in regards to repairs, the battle droid could set his sights on obtaining more crucial improvements to its combat capacity. While it had fared pretty well so far in the arena (despite having to work out a ton of bugs in its systems), it estimated that much of that success could be attributed to the poor abilities of its opponents. No doubt would the opposition at the next tier prove more formidable, and the droid wanted to be ready for them before advancing.

Thrax lays back on the inclined table/rest while the pit droids begin earning their keep. They work slowly, and often stop to bicker between themselves, but, like any job done by droids, the progress is steady and undeniable. While they toil on A-88, Leak finishes with YVH-28, reattaching his head roughly 8 hours later. Leak then begins painting his armor plating a smokey black color and his chassis a dark crimson. After drying for an hour he bolts the armor back on and powers up the large droid.
**"Booting… Systems nominal. Psychological war-fare software loading… Loaded."** A-88 can see a subtle shift in the way the YVH model stands and carries itself. It has no effect on Thrax, but the difference can be seen. **"Loading objective parameters… Loaded."** YVH's photoreceptors scan the room, glowing reddishly whenever the land on a moving object, though they quickly fade again as he obviously finds no targets. **"My master sends his thanks, LE-two-three. Transferring funds now… Done."** He turns from Leak and approaches Thrax, **"Unit designate "Scrappy" my master would like to speak with you about an offer he wishes to make due to your success thus far. Will you comply?"** As he asks Leak approaches as well, helping the pit droids. With his help, the last hour's work will take less than ten minutes.

Allowing the two pit droids to get to work on removing the ion residue from his motivators, receptors, and other external units, the battle droid runs repeated internal processes to remove all the "scrap data" that follows an ion discharge.
While the work proceeds slowly, A-88 is glad to see that the result seems to be in top shape, and as he rises from the table he feels little remaining trace of the Jawas ion weaponry. Sure, Leak helped with the finishing touches, but still.
As the YVH unit states its request, the battle droid finds it a bit odd. He had been operating under the assumption that Leak was the droids master, but with such a request presented in the presence of the mechanic, it would seem otherwise.

On entering the scrawny Verpine welcomes them, **"Ah YVH-28, the paint is intimidating. I trust the software was installed? Good. Scrappy! How did you enjoy using your new missile launcher?

With memory banks refreshing from backups after the ionization, pieces of information previously unavailable returns to A-88, and he recognizes the Verpine as the master of YVH-28. Upon entering the establishment, he scans the surroundings, finding things to be much like when he last was here.
**"Affirmative: The hardware provided have proved to be most formidable indeed, even if the gravitational targeting system seems to be slightly uncalibrated for beings of less than average masses. However, rectifying slightly uncalibrated targeting algorithms is quickly turning out to be a specialty for this unit. However, this unit does not require additional ordnance at the moment"**
He takes a moment to turn to the YVH droid, and extends one hand towards it.

It also has a fresh paint job, and is emblazoned with advertisements for the Verpine's shop. **"For the sum of twelve hundred credits, provided you use the swoop in to travel to and from all matches for at least one month.

As he pondered the offer presented, A-88´s photoreceptors shifted from YVH-28, to the swoop, to the Verpine.
**"Unfortunate Decline: While your offer is acceptable, this unit is prevented from participating in advertisement for anyone that might be a competitor to its creators. On a conflicting but related subject, it is also prevented from disclosing the identity of mentioned creators.

Feeling like his business with the Verpine might be concluded for the moment, the battle droid almost began to head out, but a possible compromise fell out of his processor.
**"Alternate Proposal: However, as previously mentioned, the YVH unit has been associated with this establishment, and its success in the arena is providing improvements in business. This unit could offer to assist it on occasion in future matches.

Human blaster carbine 2500
Nautolan flechette launcher 2500
Tusken Raiders 4500

Fortunately, in this case that choice happens to match with the one where the estimated difficulty is the lowest.

The droid cocks its head slightly at the petulance coming from another droid before answering, **"So be it. Since you wish to attempt it alone you may have two hours to prepare. It will take one hour to get the pit ready. It will be pit Four, last on the right."**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, I'm not trying to tell ya how to play your character DA, but I wanna point something out since your going into a major fight. You have very few to no allies in this city. Last time you were disabled you had a partner who won the fight and decided to take your chassis back to Leak. If you go in alone without making some kind of arrangement in case you lose it would be bad. No one has asked so far, but the reason Gladiators aren't allowed to loot corpses is because the Arena sells off whatever is left, which in your case, even if you spend the Force Point to not die, would be you and your weaponry. Realistically, anyone in their right mind that bought a defeated war-droid would mind-wipe the thing before reactivating it. Organics who are beaten but not outright killed are left to lay there a while, if they get up they get up, if they die their corpse is tossed out and belongings sold. Droids don't get up with out someone to repair them.
And last but not least, the protocol droid did warn you about the match. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

**"Acknowledgment: Very well then, this unit will return at the appointed time. You may wish to prepare a large canister to dispose of the waste materials after the match"**
Turning around, the battle droid began to list the various preparations he had to make before the match. He also tried to draw whatever conclusions about the upcoming match he could from the information he had at hand. Most likely, the numbers he were about to face would be overwhelming, though he couldn´t really understand what kind of audience would find a match were the odds were heavily stacked against one side to be entertaining. Notwithstanding that he was going to prevail, he began to realize he would never understand the workings of the spectators of the arena. He would just try to perform his tasks as efficient and swiftly as possible, and perhaps they would eventually come to recognize him as well.
With a few simple preparations in mind, he made his way back to the Verpines shop. Clanging his unpowered vibroblade against the door frame as he entered, he called the attention of the shops owner.
**"Request: There has been a slight change of plans, and this unit would like to replenish its supply of ordnance. In addition, any kind of low-grade explosive armament capable of ripping lightly armored humanoids to shreds with efficiency, would be highly interesting for purchase. Finally, this unit would like to request that the owner of this establishment place a wager on the upcoming match"**
((
I´d like to replenish my missile supply, of course, and also to buy a Rail Detonator Gun (Force Unleashed) or Flechette Launcher to supplement it. Preferably the Rail Detonator, because it has a larger ammo supply and, you know...explodes <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> I think it comes down to 2300 Cr

**"As a sign of understanding and to show there is no animosity, you may have the first four-shot canister free,"** the Verpine says as he turns and lifts the pristine rifle from its rack.

yeah, 1950, and I'm being nice and giving you one canister free. No weight is listed for the canisters so I'm ruling that they are 1 kilo each, so with the storage capacity and the rifle loaded you can carry 6 total without using internal storage. Remember, the launcher magazine weighs 8 kilos, might wanna look into a ready harness. That way you could carry the launcher as active, then holster it and it would free up your mount and ease the encumbrance a little.

**"Agreement: This unit will purchase the rifle, loaded, with one additional canister to spare. It will not require integration with existing weapon systems, but wield it as a stand-alone armament, capable of discharging if the bulk becomes too cumbersome"**
Taking the weapon, A-88 inspected it, familiarizing himself with the thing. After completing the payment, he replaced the pack of his missile launcher with the new one. Taking the rifle in one hand, he left the shop and headed back towards the arena.

Thrax quickly makes his way back to the Arena and to his pit. After receiving the same instructions he finds himself in the cage, looking out over the new pit. The area is massive, looking much like a re-purposed warehouse. Off to his right stand stacks of crates and on his left a quartet of broken down bulk loader droids. The center of the room's floor is destroyed, broken steel showing pulverized stone beneath. A large catwalk spans the center, with a staircase at each end. The catwalk is supported by beams reaching from the floor, and sparse scattering from the ceiling for stability. On the far side Thrax can see three loading/unloading bays, along with more crates and loader droids.
The announcer's voice crackles to life over the pit's PA system, **"COME ONE, COME ALL TO THE KILLEE-KOR ARENA!!!"** he pauses to allow the roaring of the quickly growing crowd. **"WE ARE HERE TO WITNESS SCRAPPY THE DROID'S ATTEMPT AT A SOLO CRUCIBLE MATCH!!!

## Re: Colicoid Creation Nest Beta Test

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-05 19:51:38)

Stepping into the arena, A-88´s tactical analysis programs begins to run, taking in data about the new surroundings. He almost immediately fixates on the catwalk in the center as an important tactical element. However, he also notices that his newly acquired gear is weighing him down more than expected, and the added weight and imbalance is greatly affecting his maneuverability. He decides that the tactical option is to unload as much heavy ordnance as possible in an initial assault, both to keep the pressure on his foes, and also to stabilize his chassis and regain the mobility he have lost if it would turn out to be a lengthly fight.
Measuring the distance across the arena, the battle droid decides to try and keep as much distance between himself and his opposition. From what he knew of Tusken Raiders, they were primitive and preferred to fight hand-to-hand with simple weapons, but were also known to use various ranged weaponry. While he was no novice in melee combat, the sheer numbers of the Tuskens where a risk factor, which could probably overwhelm him on its own.
Settling down on one knee, he primed a missile into its chamber, and locked onto the portal to the right, trying to fix on the small gravitational pulse coming from inside. He would wait until his enemy had taken a few steps out into the arena before launching his strike, to get maximum effect and hopefully eliminate the opposition from that direction in a single strike. Additionally, he though, there would be a chance that the resulting shockwave might cause one or more of the broken droids to detonate, further adding to the mayhem. And last but not least, he hoped, there was a slim chance that he might even break the arch itself, and the falling debris might take some of them with it.

Thrax waits with a patience and stillness only a droid possesses, and soon it pays off. From the left and right tunnels stream Tuskens, six from each. His reticle lights up red and he activates his launcher, sending a ball of death screaming towards one group, which impacts and causes a massive explosion, followed by another, smaller explosion as one of the defunct droids detonates with it. The first four of the Tuskens from that tunnel simply aren't there anymore, and the last two seem shaken and weak, staggering through the remains of their comrades. The rest of the Tuskens all surge forward, their coarse cries barely heard over the cheering crowd. From the center tunnel comes a trio of thundering bellows as three Banthas with two Tuskens each emerge single file and split so that they have room to maneuver. Each mounted Tusken carries a blaster carbine, and three of the six fire once they have line of sight on A-88. One finds his mark, the others waste ammunition, and their counterparts focus on moving the Banthas across the pit as quickly as possible.

Satisfied with the end result of his explosive opening, the battle droid shook a little as the blaster bolt from one of the mounted Tuskens struck him in his armored chest plate. At the thickest spot on his armor though, no real damage was inflicted, and he started his threat assessment routines again. While the mass of walking opponents closed in on him fast, the ones armed with ranged weapons still seemed like the largest threat, and he figured he would try to hold off the melee horde until he took care of them.
Moving out of the archway he had been standing in, he moved towards the two enemies that ha survived his initial assault as he fed another missile into the firing tube of his launcher. As his unbalanced chassis shook from the release of the deadly warhead, he began to draw power into his vibroblade, just in case he would need it.

Thrax's second missile streaks towards its targets, and the Tuskens can be seen dropping to hang from the sides of the Banthas which absorb the majority of the blast, their thunderous howls shaking the pit and drowning out the crowds. The riders struggle back atop their mounts and hasten to separate the furred beasts, and the Tuskens afoot surge forward again, surrounding A-88, gaderffii striking for his joints. In spite of the crushing mass of Tusken around him, Thrax avoids the initial wild thrust.

Disappointed to see his mounted adversaries use their mounts as cover, the battle droid immediately readies himself to launch another barrage at the cowardly warriors. However, he finds himself otherwise occupied as the onrushing mass of enemies puts on an effort to reach him quickly. Taking them as they come, the droid isn´t capable of moving fast enough to avoid being completely swarmed. Even though he works his best to fend of their weapons with blade and armored limbs, the odds that one of them will strike something vital increases with every enemy left alive.
Butting one of the assailants away, A-88 clears enough space to level his newly acquired rifle in the height of a Tusken abdomen, and presses the trigger. The flechettes should not bite hard into his armor even at this range, but he expects that they will tear through the organics quite nicely.

What A-88 thought were the mounted Tuskens dropping for cover was actually just the mounted Tuskens dropping to the floor, their bodies steaming from the impact of his missile. The Banthas move almost as if lost, but quickly notice the other Tuskens surrounding Thrax, and make for them at their slow rumbling speed.
The new rifle roars in his hands, splattering shrapnel across three of his assailants. The Tuskens surrounding him yell their broken war cries and attempt to pound the war droid into scrap. Due to their sheer numbers, they quickly begin to succeed.

The good thing about being a droid is that feelings like desperation never gets the better of you. As such, panic does not grip the battle droid when the Tusken´s vicious clubs starts to wear down on him. Instead, radical procedures for survival starts to process the best course of action. Not that the plans they suggest are in any way optimal, and calculations shows that the odds lean heavily against him. On the plus side though, he guesses that the crowd may be really impressed if he pulls this off.
Diverting as much energy as possible to his leg servos, A-88 pushes away with every ounce of strength his droid frame can muster, and sends himself flying into the air. As he nears the highest point on his blast, he bends his metal chassis over, and in a single, suicidal motion sends another thermal missile roaring towards the ground, trusting that his distance to the blast and heat resilient plating will shield him from the blast.

Feeling the energy wave rush over him, the battle droid had some major systems overload and temporary shutdown of the systems before he hit the ground. With systems quickly restoring themselves, it was no doubt that he was indeed in some serious trouble. Determined to go down fighting though, he primed his rifle again to blast a hole in the wall of enemies surrounding him.
With the closest trio of opponents falling to the ground, shredded by the sharp metal pieces, he tries to move away from the rest of the group, hopefully keeping some distance to them.

Thrax lands amidst the rubble of his kamikaze attack only slightly harmed. A quick twist and roar from his new flechette launcher downs three of his quickly dwindling number of opponents. He hobbles away under his heavy load, and the only remaining melee opponent follows, lashing out at his beaten chassis. Blood and moral loss must be taking its toll, because the Tusken misses by a large margin.
From his left comes a thundering as one of the maddened Banthas approach, and a second rumble catches him almost unaware as another of the beasts charges him, attempting to trample him underfoot. The crazed creature's tusks catch the tough droid, lifting him into the air and tearing at his frame. Were A-88 an organic the shear strength of the beast would be terrifying.
The third Bantha bellows and hastens to join its fellows in stamping out this dangerous battle droid. The last Tusken scoops up the rifle of one of his fallen comrades and fires on Thrax. His inexpert shot misses thanks to the crowds around his target though.
The crowds roaring would be magnificent to behold, were it not drowned out by the thunder of Bantha stomping the ground to dust and their enraged bellows.

Fighting for his continued existence against even tougher odds than before, the battle droid once again finds himself resorting to the "emergency procedures" section of his programming. As he feels the sheer impact of the banthas ram, all sorts of alerts begins to signal his chassis falling apart. In a final act of effort, he tries to push as much out of his internal reactors as possible (something just as likely to overload and shut him down) and primes his weapons for one final strike.
His already beaten frame rocks as another missile flies loose, and spurred on by the momentum, A-88 swings around, firing his rifle at the massive creature coming up on him from behind, hoping the beast had already taken too much damage to remain standing from the metallic flechettes.

Thrax's redundant systems come online, keeping the Bantha's attack from disabling him. He crashes to the ground and angles his body, firing another missile off to his right and then rolling left to fire his rifle at the last approaching creature. His missile finds purchase on the Banthas only through virtue of their size, and its massive blast radius perforates the nearby Tusken. The last Bantha lumbers towards the pair, attempting to trample A-88 underfoot. The last Tusken moves closer and fires again. Somehow the beleaguered droid avoids their attacks. The crowd is oddly silent, seeming overawed by the massive chunks of gore littering the pit.

Weaving and twisting his metal chassis, the robust battle droid manages to avoid the onslaught of his opposition, and another missile assault drops several of them low. A blaster shot flies far above his head, and he understands that the wounded Tusken that had picked up his fallen comrades weapons knows very little about how to use it. No matter to the droid though, who focuses on the last remaining Bantha. With power flowing through the vibroblade attached on his right forearm, the battle droid sweeps the powerful weapon across his opponents face, aiming to find its throat as it exposes itself.
Driving his powered blade into the beast, it shudders with pain, but using all his mechanical strength, he pulls the creature towards him before dislodgning the weapon, and steps in behind the large carcass to gain some cover from his last standing opponent. He might be a terrible shot, but you never knew when someone was about to get lucky.

A-88's blade sinks deeply into the beast's cranium, and it crashes limply to the ground. With a quick side step he places the corpse between himself and his lone opponent, already adjusting his targeting parameters. The Tuskens wails, and aims carefully since moving allies can no longer hinder his shots. He still misses by a large margin, and the crowds roaring becomes sheer cacophony as they await this suicidal droid's next victim.

It provides low cover as long as adjacent, so +5 right now.

Pressing himself behind the Bantha carcass, the battle droid watches the shot of his opponent fly wide, and the logical conclusion his processor finds is that he knows his time is up. Stepping out from behind his cover, A-88 raises his rifle and at the sound of the increasing roar of the crowd, he pulls the trigger and launches the metallic canister through the air, ready to spread its deadly payload over his lone enemy.

A-88's round impacts near the remaining Tusken, showering it with shrapnel. It bellows and levels its rifle, determined to stand its ground against the death machine. This time the Force is with the Tusken as his shot flies true, striking a terrible blow on the war-droid that had killed what was left of his tribe.
Sparks fly and the crowd roars and jeers as the seemingly unstoppable war-droid is laid low. The triumphant Tusken looses a war-cry, and the attendant droids enter the pit and gun him down without ceremony. The announcer's voice crackles over the intercom, **"AND ANOTHER GLADIATOR LOST TO THE CRUCIBLE!!! THIS IS THE END OF SCRAPPY THE DROID!!! LETS GIVE HIM A HAND FOLKS, HE MADE A GOOD SHOW!!!"** the crowd answers by thundering the pit with their cheers before beginning to trickle out the exits.
Leak reaches up and shuts off the display showing the pit and turns to the Pit-droids that belonged to A-88. **"Your master has been terminated. You may stay here for a wage minus costs of maintenance. Do you agree?"** Both droids still look at the dead screen, beeping softly to each other in binary about the great and terrible droid who had saved them from the Jawas. Their heads turn towards each other, and they nod simultaneously before turning to Leak and agreeing to his terms.
Zraii Zex sits back from his viewscreen, his antennae drooping. **"The CCN model has fallen. Go quickly and bid on the scrap. The chassis is the priority, the weapons can be replaced. Go, GO!!"** he tells his YVH war droid, who hurries out of the weapons shop.
**"Our teszzzzt izzzz completed. The unit izzzz capable,"** one Colicoid says as he watches the end of the match over the Arena-Net.
**"Needzzzz new programming. Too aggreszzzzzzive, not enough zzzzelf prezzzzervation. ZZZZZZhould we acquire remainzzzz?"**
**"No. Too much damage zzzzuzzztained for zzzzuczzzzezzzful reverzzzze engineering. Leave it."** The two bug creatures begin packing up their base, logging their recordings from A-88's databanks and preparing to return to their home planet with their findings.

He's not moving, so no new map is needed. You dealt half damage, and checking the combat, he's taken no damage at all throughout the fight. What is your current HP?

This is the end of Thrax A-88, and damn what a ride. He had a good haul, can't wait to see the next entry from DA.
