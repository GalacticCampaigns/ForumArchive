# [Fell Legacy] 001 - Assembled by the Admiral

### **simplyscribed** (2008-04-04 14:10:31)

*â€œReport to the main conference hall in civilian clothes.
Do not be late. Do not be early. Do not discuss this with any one.
Arrive at the appointed time:â€*
That was the mysterious message you received bearing all the appropriate codes to indicate it was indeed an Alliance missive, and from high up in command. Nothing more was said about why, or who else would be there. It would turn out when you arrived that the time given was not the same time received by the othersâ€”that each would be arriving at five minute intervals to be admitted alone into the conference hall where they would meet any who had arrived before them, and see none other than the Fian Admiral Granto sitting at the head of the conference room table. He gestured you to sit down in silence and wait.
First to arrive had been Meqli Aâ€™kla. Then Kieran Lunelle, Alexandra Davion, Tor Farlander, and finally Zarinia Malvec.
---
The Admiral smiles. It is the smile of a man who cannot find many reasons to do so any more but keeps fighting for the right.
â€˜Now our number is complete. Greetings, everyone. You may be wondering about the strange method of our gathering. For now Iâ€™ll just say that it is an odd group I have collected in this room, which you will understand later, and I did not want you to meet and discover things about each other without myself present to keep things under control. Now... I ask that you humour me a while longer and refrain from interrupting what needs to be said.â€™
Granto leans forward, causing the egg-shaped repulsor chair he sits on to wobble slightly before it adjusts to the new distribution of his mass.
â€˜I am fortunate that my command is playing host to such skilled and talented individuals as your selves. Between you, I believe you are as prepared as any could be to take on a delicate mission.â€™
He presses a button on the arm of his chair and the holoprojector in the middle of the table emits the image of a huge red planet, orbited by eighteen moons.
â€˜As you are all well aware, the remnants of the Alliance are broken and scattered, harrying the Sith-controlled Empire in hit and run tactics reminiscent of the Rebellion of old. We actively seek any advantage we can find in this warâ€”and we thought weâ€™d found just such an advantage on Abatrarg. A gas giant with eighteen moons; it was on the seventh that our scouts discovered a small facility. Within, they found equipment used for tibanna gas mining. It was concluded that the facility was a backup station for a tibanna mining platform located in the gas giantâ€™s atmosphere, and a team was sent to find the platform and investigate. A secret source of tibanna gas would be an incredible resource for the Alliance to exploit.â€™
As the story unfolds, more images emerge from the holoprojector to hover above the tableâ€”the location and layout of the facility on the seventh, desert moon; diagrams of tibanna mining equipment; then an image of a typical mining platform.
â€˜We have not had any communication from the survey team in a standard galactic week.â€™ Granto says heavily. â€˜And we need to investigate. I needed a team I could be sure would handle anything, as we have sketchy enough facts about what can be expected there. And so Iâ€™ve assembled you all. Introductions now, I think.â€™
He points to each in turn, giving a short introduction for you all.
â€˜Meqli Aâ€™kla, a very talented healer; Kieran Lunelle, an investigator who once worked with the Galactic Reconstruction Police; Alexandra Davion, an excellent smuggler; Zarinia Malvec, who has been working as Alexandraâ€™s co-pilot. The two of them have risked the wrath of the Sith by aiding the Alliance. And, Iâ€™m told, Felâ€™s remnant; lastly, one of Felâ€™s own men, Tor Farlander, an Imperial Knight. We picked up Farlanderâ€™s distress signal when his ship broke down after a battle with Sith loyalists. While I have no love for Roan Fel or his Empire, Iâ€™m not so short-sighted to believe we can afford to fight a war on two fronts. Tor, if he agrees to this mission, will be free to return to his own afterwards. With positive reports of his time among us, I hope.â€™
â€˜Now, who will take on this mission? Are there any questions?â€™

Alexandra was shown to the door. The guard asked her to stop just outside and wait. She looked at the guard and smiled.
"I don't suppose that you can tell me whats going on here can you?" she was hoping that he might say something but she knew better.
The soldier just looked at her. "No Miss. Davion. Just that I was to bring you here." Two seconds later the door opened and she was ushered into a large conference room. She was surprised to see Admiral Granto sitting at the head of the table. With a gesture she was asked to sit with two others.
To say that there was tension in the room would not be a lie. Uncertainty of the future and the knowledge of the present can weigh heavy on people. This was certainly one of these times. Alexandra was actually beginning to think that she may have run into some trouble but dismissed it as two more entered the last was her co-pilot Zarinia who she gave a nod to as she sat.
Being asked to forestall questions till he was done Alex nodded and listened. What ever was going to be said they asked her to be here for a reason. *I wonder why they brought me here. I'm a small time smuggler with ties to no one.* She thought as he continued speaking. and leaned back into the chair.
With a few more pleasantries he launched into the reason why they had all been called here. It was interesting to say the least. But why not his own personnel? She filed that in the back of her mind to ask later.
His pitch over, he went on and began the introductions. Covering all five of them.
"Now, who will take on this mission? Are there any questions?" The Admiral asked.
*I have plenty of questions, question is where to start. I didn't get this far by jumping into something blindly.* She thought.
She cleared her throat and leaned forward to place her forearms on the table. "Yes Admiral I have one to start things off. Why us? Don't you have qualified personnel that could do this mission?" It was a legit question. Maybe he did have the personnel, maybe he didn't. Or he want people who had no affiliation to the Alliance.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">OOC:</span> There's no OCC section so I'm putting this here. Nice intro post btw. On another note my dad is visiting this weekend so my comp time may just be limited to late evenings. But I will be sure to post then if there's something to post on. Game on folks.

Carefully wriggling her fingers towards Alexandra when she walks in, Zarinia tries to maintain the proper decorum and composure that any 'I'm Just a Normal Co-Pilot' would in such a very serious situation. Which means, when she sat down, she didn't put her feet up on the table. That's a good start.
However, as the Admiral begins talking, and starts to explain things in greater detail, Zarinia's eyebrows slowly raised and she leaned forward in her chair listening intently. Those green eyes then drifted over the grouping assembled and slowly lingered on Farlander. Now THAT was going to be interesting.
Not wanting to play her own sabaac card, Zarinia resisted the reach out with the Force to read the assembled group any better. Instead she just took her time, odd enough for a Zeltron, before turning to Alexandra as she slowly rose from her seat. Walking over to the woman she had been working with for some time now, Zarinia reached out to put a hand on the other woman's soldier, smiling as she bent down next to Alexandra's ear. "Imagine it. You, the ace pilot that you are, me the great scout I am. One of Fel's men who's no doubt good with a blaster, a healer, a security agent, what could go wrong?" she asks with a wink. "Besides, if you negotiate this right, you might be able to get a small percentage of the profits once we've beaten Krayt's Empire. Now would that be such a bad thing?" she asks.
Zarinia straightens and flashes the Admiral a smile as well, putting her hand on the back of Alexandra's chair now, and leaning against it. "I think you already knew that I have a weakness for overwhelming odds and would have said yes. Maybe it's a family trait, I haven't figured that out yet," she notes with a casual wave of her hand. "But I'm in."

He walks through the corridors with long and regular strides, the walk of someone who has somewhere to go. Wearing smart but inconspicuous clothing - a black jacket over a deep blue shirt and black trousers - he made his way towards the conference room. Not being an unfamiliar face in the last week or so and not the only one with business to attend to, he easily weaved through the living traffic without gaining much attention.
Kieran feels a prickling sensation all over him as he headed for the conference room as per his instructions. He had always felt somewhat nervous going to clandestine meetings, not knowing what the host had planned or whether there was an ambush waiting to happen.
*Well. At least this ambush won't involve blaster fire. I hope.*
Stepping through the door he saw Admiral Granto at the head of the table and a Caamasi at the side. Before he could say "reporting as ordered" or something along those lines - he was never commissioned or military after all - the Admiral pre-empted him with a silent gesture to sit.
Directed by the oppressive silence he only nodded to the Admiral and then the Caamasi in acknowledgement before taking the seat next to him. He did not recognise the Caamasi, but that wasn't surprising as he tended not to concentrate on faces as a habit. The Admiral however he recognised, having seen him on occasion but never having spoken.
He let his mind drift as usual when he had to wait or had nothing to do. To the Admiral and the unnamed Caamasi he seemed to be gazing blankly at the other side of the table, but while his mind rested and eyes defocused his other senses were working just fine. His mind dimly recorded the rustles of movement from the others as time passed and the faint whisky like aroma that seemed to hang in the room. Shortly after he heard the door slide open and another entered the room.
*Hm. very smooth walk. but a look of a spacer. unusual. uncommon.*
The evaluation passed through his mind faintly while he offered her a professional nod of acknowledgement. *Hm. Green eyes.* The atmosphere was still one of silence, thus a friendly greeting would have been somewhat out of place. She settled into a seat and he drifted once more.
This cycle repeated as the last two entered.
*Soldier. Not a bad one either. confident and or disciplined ones stand and marchwalk like that.*
*Zeltron. So young. Most of her life must be under the empire or the war. Athletic. No slouchers in this little group. First thing I thought was Zeltron?*
Everyone's attention turns to the Admiral and Kieran follows suit.
*Oh now we're smiling* he quieted his mind as he took in the briefing...
As the briefing drew to a close more thoughts scattered across his mind.
*Healer? doesn't he mean medic? Yup. that's me. Too refined to be a smuggler surely. That one makes more sense, Kids these days… Huh, a random Imperial Knight?*
â€˜Now, who will take on this mission? Are there any questions?â€™
*Sure but…* the smuggler team stepped up first. As usual he would survey the others before asking his questions. As he watches the exchange between the two, more words sail across his mind.
*What an odd pair…*

*â€œReport to the main conference hall in civilian clothes.
Do not be late. Do not be early. Do not discuss this with any one.
Arrive at the appointed time:â€*
After three days being aboard this ship since being rescued from the damaged freighter, Tor had been getting restless as he was stuck in the cabin he had been assigned, constantly under the watchful eyes of the Alliance guards. " *Hmmm,*" thought Tor, "*quite the odd message, 'discuss this with no one'? Who would I talk to here on this Galactic Alliance ship anyway? If nothing else it will get me out of this room.*"
Tor looked at the clothes laid out for him, accustomed to wearing his Imperial Knight armor, the occassion to wear civilian clothes had not come up in quite some time. "*Is this what passes for fashion in the Galactic Alliance, not many places to hide my lightsaber in this get-up.*"
As Tor entered the room at the designated time, he was surprised to see that he was not alone at this meeting and to see none other than the Fian Admiral Granto sitting at the head of the conference room table. As Tor glances around at those already seated he attempts to take in what he can from those assembled. "*Hmmm, only the male spacer seems to have even the slightest posture, definitely no military here. I can fight my way from this room if need be.*" The Admiral gestures Tor to sit down in silence and wait.
Not long after Tor has taken a seat, a young female Zeltron enters and is also gestured to sit, "*At least I think she's a Zeltron*" ponders Tor, "*her complexion is a little off for most of that species. How odd?*"
Just as Tor was about to instinctively reach out with the Force to search out the room, the Admiral begins to speak.
â€˜Now our number is complete....'
Tor listens to the pleasantries the Admiral throws at the attending guests, although his attention gets drawn again and again to the Zeltron, each time Tor dismisses the distraction as must pertaining to the odd complexion of her skin.
'...as any could be to take on a delicate mission.â€™
"*Mission? What is he playing at? The Imperial Knights answer to no Galactic Alliance admiral!*"
'....A secret source of tibanna gas would be an incredible resource for the Alliance to exploit.â€™
"*As it would to the True Empire*" thinks Tor, "*those gases would come in handy to the forces stationed at Bastion. Maybe there is something to attend to here after all*"
'... And so Iâ€™ve assembled you all. Introductions now, I think.â€™
â€˜Meqli Aâ€™kla, a very talented healer;...' "*Always good to have one of those around*" thinks Tor.
'... Kieran Lunelle, an investigator who once worked with the Galactic Reconstruction Police;...' "*a spy?*"
'... Alexandra Davion, an excellent smuggler;...' "*the galaxy is too full of that type of scum*" thinks Tor, almost missing...
'...ia Malvec, who has been working as Alexandraâ€™s co-pilot. The two of them have risked the wrath of the Sith by aiding the Alliance. And, Iâ€™m told, Felâ€™s remnant;...' At these words Tor's eyes narrow as he gazes at Alexandra and the Zeltron, lingering longer on the Zeltron. "*I will defintely need to keep a close eye on this*"
'... lastly, one of Felâ€™s own men, Tor Farlander, an Imperial Knight. We picked up Farlanderâ€™s distress signal when his ship broke down after a battle with Sith loyalists. While I have no love for Roan Fel or his Empire, Iâ€™m not so short-sighted to believe we can afford to fight a war on two fronts. Tor, if he agrees to this missi...' "*Just like the Alliance to take such a cheap shot, to insinuate that an Imperial Knight of the True Empire would need the rescue of their Alliance, I would cut him down where he hovers if I thought for one moment it was the will of Emperor Fel, but I should learn more about this gas mine.*"
â€˜...Now, who will take on this mission? Are there any questions?â€™
The smuggler spoke up first. 'Yes Admiral I have ...'
"*Because he knows he can send us with no regrets if we do not return.*" thought Tor "*A shrewd move, this Fian may indeed have what it takes to be an admiral in an armada, no wonder the Alliance has met with the successes it has against the Empire ruled by those Sith usurpers.*"
When the Admiral finishes his reply to the smuggler Tor stands and straightens himself out before saying aloud, 'The Force must be with you indeed Admiral Granto. Your coming "to my aid" at such an opportune time for your Alliance is fortuitous, for it is true that the resources of the True Empire SHOULD not be wasted on fighting your Galactic Alliance as you stated. We need to focus on credible threats such as the Sith,' Tor says with a sly smirk on his face. 'I am intrigued,' Tor gives the most minute of glimpses in the direction of the young Zeltron at this, 'and as you stated the Tibanna gas would be an incredible resource to exploit. You have my services for the time being.'

Meqli maintains his silence throughout the admiral's speech and introduction, and the banter lobbied about by the rest. He mostly keeps his eyes downcast to prevent making eye contact with anyone in the room, only looking up to grin sheepishly as Admiral Granto marks him as a very talented healer.
"Has there been any indication as to who maintained the operation before the Alliance discovered it? Such a resource is not so easily discarded..." Meqli speaks in a surprisingly deep voice for one so slight of build and demeanor.

### **simplyscribed** (2008-04-06 12:38:44)

The Admiral nods with an amused smile towards Zarinia as she concludes her own pitch to persuade her friend. Once she has finished, he delivers a response of his own.
â€˜I find your question an odd one, miss Davion.â€™ Granto responds to Alexandra. â€˜I must wonder if you disagree with my assessment of your skills as a freighter pilot?â€™
â€˜But if you want my reasons for picking you in particular over other equally eligible candidates from among my own people,' he continues without pause, 'perhaps you will settle for the knowledge that I have a crate of rare gold wine from the Hapes cluster locked away in storage that could become yours? Easier, I think, than having to arrange other rewards for a job well done, such as promotions.â€™
He shifts posture to lean back in his chair again, gaze moving between each person present and coming to rest on Alexandra again at last.
â€˜There is also the fact that you have a ship with neutral transponder codes. That may save you all should you be picked up by a Sith patrol.â€™
The fian then waits patiently while Tor delivers an acceptance concealing sly barbs. To his credit, he doesnâ€™t even bristle.
â€˜Yes, I had a feeling I would have no problems persuading you. But then, this is your only way to return to wherever it is Fel is hiding, since I donâ€™t have the resources to lend you a shuttle if you have not first done something for me. Iâ€™m sure it must bother you to be so powerlessly in the hands of the Alliance.â€™
He smiles as sympathetically as possible, then turns his attention to the healer Meqli who earns an expression of satisfaction and a nod for his query.
â€˜A very apt question. All the evidence points to criminal involvement since we have no records of such a facility and there were no hints of the Empireâ€™s involvement... pre- or post-Sith rule. It is a very real possibility that the builders of the facility remain on it, and that our survey team was brought down to protect their secret. You must be extremely cautious.â€™

### **Yogi** (2008-04-06 15:08:09)

Alexandra smiled as the Admiral responded. For he knew a way to get to a smugglers ego, question their abilities. When he mention the crate of rare Hapen red gold wine he had her attention. She knew that that crate alone would be worth enough to pay off the loan she had on the *Wing*. But then again what good was a payment if one wasn't around to use it. Plus the mention of neutral transponder codes that her ship had. But she already knew that. It was a fact that had saved her butt more than once.
The Admiral went on and answered other questions. AS he did she looked at the other three that she didn't know. They all had that look of seasoned in their field. She looked at the one who was one of Fel's men. If anyone was going to be a thorn in someone's side it was going to be him.
When the Admiral finished speaking Alex nodded and spoke again. "Alright Admiral I'm in. Not like I had much choice" she said with a glance at her co-pilot with a sly grin. "When do you expect us to leave and what backups or rendezvous points do we have if any?" She sat back and another question came to mind. "And what ever else we find is up for grabs I presume?" She said with a half grin. After all she was a smuggler.

### **Thraken** (2008-04-06 15:14:18)

Following the exchange between the smuggler duo and the Admiral, Kieran's thoughts continue to tumble through his mind. *Neutral transponder is helpful. Question down then. Probably can't get any alliance support if the neutral card is to be played …Or can we?*
Kieran watches the knight rise and deliver his oratory as soon as the Admiral finishes answering the smugglers. His mind does not hold back on his opinions.
*whoa, elder statesman style. should be an officer or politian. incredible resource to exploit. missing one word so its no quote. obvious though.*
After the Admiral delivers his rebuttal his attention is drawn to a deep voice from beside him.
"Has there been any indication as to who maintained the operation before the Alliance discovered it? Such a resource is not so easily discarded..."
*sharp. one question down. Meqli here seems professional*
The Admiral duly replies.
â€˜A very apt question. All the evidence points to criminal involvement since we have no records of such a facility and there were no hints of the Empireâ€™s involvement... pre- or post-Sith rule. It is a very real possibility that the builders of the facility remain on it, and that our survey team was brought down to protect their secret. You must be extremely cautious.â€™
*Oh joy. Sounds like could be an armed entry to a fortified position*. Kieran mentally queues a number of questions, clears this throat and speaks for the first time in the meeting.
"Following on from the history of the place, the first thing you found was the backup facility. Have the team or other people tried extracting useful information from this facility regarding the operation and the platform itself?"

### **simplyscribed** (2008-04-06 16:14:57)

'I'm afraid not, miss Davion. Whatever else you find is to be considered part of the investigation. Since you're conducting it on behalf of the Alliance that means our claim of ownership once the investigation is complete is significantly greater than your own. You'll be entitled to negotiate with me if there is anything in particular you desire, naturally.'
Granto grins, amused.
'Nice try though. With regard to your other questions, in order: You will leave at 0700 tomorrow. I will give you comm frequencies and encryption codes that you can use to report back to me securely. Rest assured that I have the issues of backup and rendezvous points in hand, but you needn't know the details at this point.'
'There is some small amount of information that I haven't previously told you.' He then acknowledges with a slight incline of his head in Kieran's direction. 'The amount of spare parts found at the backup facility indicate the mining platform is not a large one - we're not talking anything to rival Cloud City - the platform could support only several hundred workers. Perhaps less, if they were generous with their supplies of spares. A distinct possibility, given the lack of contact such a secret facility has with the Galaxy. It must also be assumed that there are port or docking facilities capable of holding transports for the number of workers. Additionally, life support technologies were in large supply. It could well be that the facility is below the breathable atmosphere. Or again, it could be read as simply a sign of cautious planning.'
'Nothing conclusive, but it may help.' He says, giving a little shrug. 'You must remember that only our scouts have been to the place, none of them professional investigators, let alone of your standard. You may find something they missed. The information they did send has all been filed on a datacard that I'll give you when you leave.'

## Re: Fell Legacy 001 - Assembled by the Admiral

### **Thraken** (2008-04-06 20:20:44)

Kieran absorbed the information dispensed, lamenting the sloppiness of the of the backup facility sweep. *If we go there and have at the facility we'll probably find the precise location of the platform and a hundred and one entry points and weaknesses or a master override code if we're feeling lazy.*
The Admiral continued. 'You must remember that only our scouts have been to the place, none of them professional investigators, let alone of your standard.'
*I'm a standard? I would have thought scouts would know to gather information before wandering blindly into the beyond.
'…when you leave.' When I leave huh?*
A faint grin forms on Kieran's face. After a beat, he lets it turn to a smile and continues.
"That may be helpful Admiral, and I have some other questions." He sits up, uncrosses his arms and rests them on the table.
"I am curious as to the reason for the secrecy surrounding this meeting and mission. After all, this is just a scout and rescue mission - and..." He raises a hand towards Farlander "Our fair knight here now knows of this potential source of tibanna. Unless you're actually planning to keep him in a dark hole for a long while, the empire - or rather Emperor Fel - will also know."

Meqli hides a shy smile at the more mercenary nature of his counterparts. He forms a circle with his three-fingered hands, this appearing to be a contemplative gesture.
"What knowledge and skill I have is at your disposal, Admiral, although I do so hope there is little necessity for them."
The caamasi lifts his chin after this, looking each of his soon-to-be companions in the eye with a great deal more mettle than he had previously exhibited.
"I also hope there will be little need for violence, should we happen upon an... *unfavorable* circumstance. With the talent we have amassed here, we should be more than capable of accomplishing the task with no casualties."

"Because the Sith have spies everywhere," answers the Zeltron for the Admiral on the question of secrecy. Then Zarinia turns to look at the Admiral with a winning smile and an upraised eyebrow. "How many eyes have seen this information, out of curiosity? What would you assess are the chances of discovery by other interested parties?"
The Zeltroni woman waves a hand through the air, dismissing something as she speaks, "Now, I'm with you on this one way or another, so don't worry about this. It just doesn't help to be prepared for trouble, then if you don't have to use your preparation, well, it was a good training exercise in being cautious. And that's not really a bad thing this day and age, now is it?"
Emerald eyes drift slowly over the rest of the group as Zarinia walks back to her seat, the repulsor lifts whining as she puts her weight on the back of it and leans forward faintly. For a moment, that gaze falls upon the Imperial Knight and she just smiles, one of those annoying 'I know something that you don't' smiles that are meant to infuriate by most people. Then her gaze drifts to Melqui. "You are far too young, Kid, to be so serious. No matter what training you've had," she notes, before looking back to the Admiral.
"Anything else you think we should probably know? Like say, giant flying creatures that are cousins to mynocks that might very well attack us where we're headed?"

*"…powerlessly in the hands of the Alliance."*
The words repeated themselves in Tor's mind, as he makes every attempt to calm himself inwardly, for on the outside he is as always the staunch soldier of Emperor Fel.
Tor begins to repeat in his mind the mantra taught him during his training with the Imperial Knights.
*"There is no emotion, there is peace.
There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.
There is no passion, there is serenity.
There is no death, there is the Force.
Above all these and always there is the Empire."*
Tor sits and listens as each member of the group in turn speaks. To him they are simply prattling on with their petty concerns, each of them knowing only their self-serving interests. Concerns such as these are foreign to a servant of the Emperor, their thoughts are always focused on that of the interests of the Empire and the Emperor.
The Zeltron gives him a look seemingly meant to confound him, an effort seemingly waisted as every thought in his mind concerning the young girl has been drowned in a pool of confusion and mixed thoughts.
*"…powerlessly in the hands of the Alliance."*
The words again haunt Tor's foremost thoughts. This Admiral did have to be commended. He had made a conscious effort to keep the Knight off his guard and to his credit it had seemingly worked. Tor repeats again the mantra to himself in an effort to calm his emotions.
Tor speaks, knowing he is again further alienating himself from those he will be intending to travel with, "Admiral," states Tor standing to draw the Fian's attention once more, "as you seem to want to send these children into a very adult situation, I wonder if you by any chance have a protocol droid to act as a nanny stored away with your rare wines to send with this group. " As Tor states this his eyes dart between the Zeltron and the Caamasi before continuing, "I for my part will uphold my end of our agreement by protecting these younglings you send but I will not be responsible for their bedtime storytelling."
As Tor begins to sit back down, a satisfied look on his face, a thought once more runs through his mind.
*"…powerlessly in the hands of the Alliance."*
The look of satisfaction quickly fades.

Alexandra simply looks at Tor as bantha fodder simlply escapes from his mouth. *Amazing his has the balls to talk so brazenly about his soon to me "teammates".*
She looks at Tor with a look of disbelief. "It's remarkable Tor that you can string together words to form an insult with out your Emperor telling you what to say. With that being said we are working together, weather you like it or not. We're going to have to rely on each other out there" She said pointing over her shoulder. "If your honor and loyalty to *your* emperor can't grasp that realization you might as well catch a garbage scow home."
She just shook her head as she looked at Tor, for now she was all riled up. *Children indeed.*

"My youth does not detract from the import of my request."
Meqli shakes his head in resignation, his eyes taking on a look of pained equanimity.
"Even though I am young, I have been plying my trade for some time, and recently across some small portions of the galaxy. Through the gift of memory of my people I can relive nearly every battle I've attended - the cry of every orphaned infant caused by this war, as if the blood were still fresh on my hands and the cries still ringing in my ears."
He looks down through the circle formed by his hands, his rumbling voice slowly trailing off near to a whisper.
"And although we Caamasi carry the memory of these atrocities, it is the rest of you who carry the wounds and scars. I had only hoped to prevent further injury; nothing more."

There is just a heartbeat, before Zarinia is suddenly laughing so hard, she turns her chair around and settles into it. The pink-skinned Zeltroni woman glances over at Tor as she wipes a tear from the corner of her eye, then starts laughing again. "And here I've always heard that the Imperial Knights follow the old code too strictly to even know humor. Oh, Farlander, that was good. Very good," she notes with a bright smile and then a wink at the man.
Zarinia then turns to look at Melqi with a smile. "That is precisely why you need to lighten up, find a balance between all that you've seen, felt and shared, and the good that lurks within most people. War is an ugly, ugly thing, it can be born of good intentions, it can be born of greed. But one thing is certain, it leads to suffering until an end is found."
Flicking some indigo locks from her face, Zarinia turns around, wiping a tear from her other eye before smiling at the Admiral. "And securing this tibanna gas mine gives us just a little bit more of the resources we need to end this conflict, correct?" she asks, before pausing and arching an eyebrow.
"Is anyone else slightly disconcerted that I'm speaking reason?"

The phrase "Taken aback" was made for situations such as these, for Kieran blinked and looked at the imperial knight that had just made such a statement with raised eyebrows.
*That was unbelievably petty. And ridiculous. Is this guy really an Imperial Knight? Such a childish rebuke. Is he a recruit? How can it be good for him to insult the people he's supposed to work with and are - at the moment - his only ticket home?*
His opinion and respect for the soldier collapses a few levels as he watches the reactions of the others.
Davion's indignant retort. *heh spirit.* Meqli's earnest reply. *What a reserved one, how far does that go?* Zarinia, the other member of the odd couple bursts out laughing. *Hm. My reaction is a bit of both of them. How balanced an individual I must be.*
Following her brief retort at the Knight he is surprised by the words of wisdom that follow.
*A little odd that someone like her can identify with our quiet boy here. 'end this conflict' huh? only if someone has a really really good plan that just some tibanna would kick off.*
And as if to keep Kieran off balance, she caps off with a tangental comment that leaves him shaking his head lightly, his smile never having disappeared.

> She looks at Tor with a look of disbelief. &quot;It&#39;s remarkable Tor that you can string together words to form an insult with out your Emperor telling you what to say. With that being said we are working together, weather you like it or not. We&#39;re going to have to rely on each other out there&quot; She said pointing over her shoulder. &quot;If your honor and loyalty to *your* emperor can&#39;t grasp that realization you might as well catch a garbage scow home.&quot;

Tor stands grim faced and walks steadily over to where Alexandra is positioned. When he gets to where she is he angles himself to look her in the eye. The tension in the beat that follows in palpable. Tor's one hands rests at his side, where one might hide a lightsaber if they were wearing an outfit that is not the norm for them, much like the one Tor is in now; his other hand rests on the conference table. After a tense moment drawn out by the Knight, a smile breaks out on his face before it turns in the direction of the Admiral, "Someone here with some fight in them. Good!", exclaims Tor. As he readjusts himself to his normal stance he pats the smuggler on the back before turning and beginning to move back to his seat, calling out while pointing with his thumb over his shoulder at her, "This one I like!"

Alexandra watched and listened as the others spoke. There were some surprises in what was said especially from her co-pilot. It was obvious that she didn't know everything about her.
She had also been keeping an eye on Tor watching him bristle in his chair. When it seemed like no one else was gong to say anything Tor stood and walked towards her. As he looks her in the eye she gives him the same look back. She keeps track of his hands. One at his side and the other on the table.
*Be careful Tor. If you back me into a corner you're not going to like it.* The thought ran through her mind.
Just then a smile comes across his face. "Someone here with some fight in them. Good!" he exclaims as he pats Alexandra on the back. "This one I like!" He said as he walked away pointing with his thumb over his shoulder.
She visibly relaxed, as if the coiled snake that was about to strike now noticed that the danger had passed. "I'm glad that you approve." She was glad he didn't attack. She figured that she would loose unarmed but he would have found out that you never corner someone in her trade. They may not come out on top but they will hurt you, and badly at that.

'If you have quite finished insulting your team mates, and therefore my judgement? Admiral Granto asks Tor in the kind of pleasant voice that suggests anything but pleasant consequences. He has leaned forward to watch the Knight with an uncomfortably penetrating gaze. 'You have failed to act in a manner befitting a representsative of your Emperor today, Farlander, and you can be sure I will find a way to give Fel a full report.'
'Now,' he continues, allowing his eyes to wander to others in the group, 'let us move back to more productive matters. First, Lunelle's question: the reasons for secrecy have already been stated. I did not wish you to come into any form of contact with each other before this meeting because of the unique make up of the group. Considering the behaviour some among you have already demonstrated *in my company* I can see it was a sensible choice. I've already stated this fact twice so I would be obliged if no one asks a question that requires me to say it again.'
Granto pauses and inclines his head in Zarinia's direction.
'Miss Malvec is also correct in the matter of Sith spies. I am not so worried about interference from Fel's faction even if he does somehow get the news. He will not interfere.'
'As for who has already had access to this information,' he continues in response to the question of "miss Malvec", 'just our scouts, myself, and the ranking officers in my fleet. There is always a possibility that sensitive information has been compromised but in this case it is a small one.'
Now he looks up at the holoprojection still hovering above the table. A timer in the corner indicates that it is now fully fifty minutes since the first of you arrived.
'We are running out of time.' Granto says, his tone the frustrated one of a man who is often running out of time. 'I have other matters that require my attention. Five more minutes to ask questions, if you have any remaining. Then I need to see Lunelle in private.'

"Oh, I think the questions that you can answer have been answered, Admiral," notes Zarinia as she stands up. "At least my questions, that is," she then adds. A smile and a wriggle of fingers are given to the Admiral, then that smile is flashed to the others of the assembled group.
Stepping away from her chair, Zarinia pauses and glances over her shoulder towards Alexandra. "Hey, I'll do some checking on the ship, but I need to hit the sack early tonight. You okay with doing most of the pre-flight yourself?" *I really need to meditate before this mission, before I explode on the poor Impy.* 
Another step, then another pause, and Zarinia turns around completely as she smiles, still. "Oh, Admiral, you probably have none, but let me know if there is anything I can do for you. My family has always had a soft spot for overwhelming odds and the Alliance," she notes with a bit of a shrug before moving to stand next to the door, ready to be the first to leave when Admiral Granto says the magical words: 'Dismissed'.

"Sure thing Zarinia. I can handle it. It will also give me a chance to go over the *Wing* with our new, for lack of a better word, crew." She gave a nod and smile to the others present.
She looked at the Admiral. "Admiral would it be possible to have your hanger crew refuel us before we leave just to top her off?" She says as she stands. "Also when can we expect the rendezvous instructions?"
She waits for him to answer her question and give the go ahead for them to leave.

"I see, that seems to be exactly the case."
Kieran had turned away from the spectacle on his right to listen to and respond to the Admiral. He listens, keeping his friendly appearance.
*What a scene. Granto's patience is quite impressive on the whole. Maybe I won't press on with the frivolous questions.* "...then I need to see Lunelle in private."
He blinks and leans back into his chair at this in surprise. "Uh... no more questions from me I guess Admiral." *Why does he want to see me? Something I said? Something he needs? He just giving me that data? Hmm…*
"Well, I guess that's it for today." Kieran faces the others, some of whom seem to be ready to leave. "If you don't see me in the morning then..." he pauses for a moment and drops the smiling face "...I guess you'll just be told to go on without me nor a mention or thought of my fate."

Tor sits watching the Admiral tell him and the others off he ponders the repercussions of his actions. *"Hmmm, I may have definitely alienated myself a little more than I would have liked. Definitely got the Fian to show that there is more to him than the cold & calculated machine he would like to have us buy into."* Tor moves his index finger into a crooked shape and holds it to his mouth thinking of his next move. *"I will have to prove myself to the rest of this crew and win them back, not my strong suit but they will see my mettle in the field and that should hopefully be the start of fixing things."*
Tor watched the Zeltron talking to the Captain Davion telling her that she would not be able to assist with pre-flight preparations. *"No time like the present,"* thinks Tor. He makes a motion to the smuggler before stating, "Captain if you need assistance with the pre-flight preparations, I would be happy to assist. I have been known to spend some time in a starship over the years."
The Knight looks over to the Admiral, and simply nods as if to say "I believe this round between us is finished."

Meqli slides out of his seat, hoisting a pair of heavy-looking med kits over a shoulder, giving each an affectionate pat.
"I think you will find your trust well placed, Admiral." He nods slightly to Granto while folding his hands together within the sleeves of his robes. He shuffles to stand just beside the door, unsure of the protocol of the situation, but waiting with everyone else just the same.

'Miss Davion, the datacard will be delivered to your ship. I cannot risk it falling into unexpected hands. Lunelle, stay. Every one else is free to do as they wish. Dismissed.' Granto says, seeing no one has further questions.
The Admiral then sits in silence as every one but Kieran makes their exit from the room.

At the last word from the Admiral, Zarinia happily spins on her foot to stand in front of the door. As they slide open, Zarinia steps out into the hallway and stretches her arms into the air. Green eyes flick towards the Caamaasi Melqi as the woman lets her arms hang behind her head. "So... a pair of med kits?" she asks curiously in the hallway. "Glad someone knows how to treat injuries. I tried learning once, it wasn't very pretty. I can scout, and what have you, but if I hurt myself in the process it's an amusing sight," the Zeltron woman offers in conversation.

She nodded to Tor when he asked to help with preflight duties and then followed Zarinia out the door when they were dismissed. When the door closed she sighed. "Now I know what I never joined the military. Too many rules." She looked at Tor and held out her hand. She still didn't trust the Imperial Knight but they were going to have to work together.
"Sorry Tor for the words in there. I understand the needs of a smuggler may be different than your own. But to keep my ship running I need credits. I would not have gotten to where I am today if I also didn't look out for my own interests. As we all must do from time to time. Just one thing though. Don't back me into a corner. Others have before and they didn't like it." She gave him a friendly wink as her hand slid habitually to where her blaster would be on her hip. Noticing that it wasn't there she made a face. "Stang, I'm not used to being unarmed." She looked at the two that had never seen the *Wing*. "Come on I'll take you to my ship, *Freedom's Wing*, and get you familiar with it a bit."

As Tor left the conference room with the others he took in the statement made to him by the smuggler,
"Sorry Tor for the words in there. I understand the needs of a smuggler may be different than your own. But to keep my ship running I need credits. I would not have gotten to where I am today if I also didn't look out for my own interests. As we all must do from time to time. Just one thing though. Don't back me into a corner. Others have before and they didn't like it."
As Ms. Davion gave him a friendly wink the Imperial Knight noticed her hand slid to where a blaster would be fastened on her hip. As Tor replied to Alexandra's statement he stood as upright as was humanly possible and replied with the utmost sincerity, "Ms. Davion, I would have to consider you a complete failure at your profession if you were not considering how to maintain the costs of running your ship. By no means do I take offense to you standing up for yourself, it shows true strength of character. As for putting you in a corner, know that as long as we follow the same path the only reason you would be backed in a corner by me is if I am standing between you and an enemy with my lightsaber drawn."
As Alexandra extends her invitation to the others to familiarize them with her ship, "Come on I'll take you to my ship, *Freedom's Wing*, and get you familiar with it a bit.", Tor falls in line with the others and follows the captain to the ship.

"Just don't get in the way of her blaster," calls Zarinia over her shoulder to the two behind her, Tor and Alexandra. "She's a really good shot and pretty useful with that thing. I haven't seen a situation yet," notes the Zeltron, "Where she needed that much protecting." The words are easy, bileless, as Zarinia waves a hand over her shoulder as she lazily walks ahead. "Sides, Knight-Boy, word of advice, never insult the pride of a woman when it comes to protecting herself," she states, turning her head just enough to offer a wink.
Now, Zarinia's demeanor may say one thing, but let no one be fooled, for the woman's keen emerald eyes are watching the corridor ahead, quietly observing anyone who happens to fall under their gaze. "And certainly do not insult her piloting skills. I've heard of your family, Farlander, good pilots all, but the boss-lady here has a real gift, let me tell you. And trust me, I know. I come from a family of pilots, as well!"

## Re: Fell Legacy 001 - Assembled by the Admiral

### **Yogi** (2008-04-15 23:12:40)

Alex smiles as Zarinia backs up her skills. She looks at Tor who is beside her as they walk behind her co-pilot. "Just think, I don't even pay her to say those things. Imagine if I did." She makes a big wave with her hands and imitates Zarinia's voice to the best of her ability. *"You mean you've never heard of the Freedom's Wing? It's the ship that did the Kessel run faster than the Millennium Falcon."* She chuckled as she laid a hand on he stomach. The *Falcon.* It's the freighter that every smuggler held their own ship up to. While the *Wing* had several special modifications she had done herself, she had a long way to go before she could even hope to call her ship an equal of the *Falcon.*
Reaching the hanger bay she led them over to where her freighter was berthed. The YT-2400 with its cockpit off to the left was idea. It allowed her to put it right to the wall for maximum efficiency. She came to a stop before the dark gray freighter. It was obvious that it wasn't new by any means. A few scorch marks could be seen here and there but they were for show only at this point. The damage had long been repaired. Looks can be deceiving and Alexandra used that to her advantage.
"There she is, my home away from home. She may not look like much but she gets the job done." Leading them around the exterior she examined a repair she had made not long ago. Seeing that it was still in good shape she continued. She smiles as a hint of pride seeps into her voice as she speaks. "I've upgraded the hyperdrive to a class one. Military grade shielding, standard double laser turret down here and a upgraded quad turret on the top side. Concussion missile launcher operated by the pilot and some combat thrusters to let me perform with the best of the fighters out there. The only thing I haven't upgraded is the sublight drives as they cost a fortune. Most of the things I can't out run I can out gun."
She finished her walk around and ended up at the ramp and entered the code to drop the boarding ramp. "You may want to grab your gear and stow it aboard. From the sounds of it I think the Admiral wants us to get going soon."

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-16 10:29:50)

Tor listens as Zarinia speaks, his head tilting slightly at her words, a physical reaction that has manifested itself to represent the confusion constantly brought on by her to the Knight. Before he can reply, Alexandra quips about her co-pilot's remarks, Tor gives a slight grin before returning his attention to the Zeltron's comments. "Miss Zarinia, you have to understand that by no means did I mean to infer that due to Alexandra being a woman she would need my protection, my remark extends to yourself, our intelligence officer friend, and the Caamasi healer as well. I will not allow harm to my companions as long as I draw breath. I have fought many a battle, and over the last few years a number of those have involved the Sith. They attack like wild dogs in number, but they are skilled in the ways of combat. If Miss Davion is half as good with that blaster as you say she is I will be glad to have her around. Reaching a target that is more than a lightsaber's blade away is never a bad thing and is something always welcome on the battlefield. But no number of skilled shooters will stop them all from getting close up, but I shall to the utmost of my ability. That is a promise to you and to all who go on this mission, a promise from a Knight of Emperor Fel and that is no small thing."
Tor takes a moment for the earnestness and seriousness of his comments to sink in before deadpanning, "On the other hand I hope Ms. Davion's piloting skills are even better than you claim, for unlike my ancestors, while I am able to keep a ship in the air, my piloting skills are not my strong suit. As my mother always told me as a small child before I left to join the Imperial Knights, the strength of my skills all fell into my charming personality and way with others."
Tor grinned, as he had amused at least himself, and looked over the war-torn YT-2400 before them in the hanger bay. He thinks to himself about continuing to joke with his fellow crew mates, maybe something about their bravery and flying in a ship that beat up looking, but thinks better of it and keeps it to himself.

That line was just too obvious, and Zarinia had to snort to keep herself from following up on Tor's comments in a negative manner. Instead, she waved a hand over her shoulder, before smiling at the old ship. "Which is why, Farlander," she noted very calmly, "You should have more than one weapon at the ready, with a few kept in hiding to always surprise your enemies. I use a blaster myself, and a few other weapons that I've trained in. I've found it quite handy in a pinch. I even have a reserve weapon I haven't used in what seems like ages!"
Zarinia stretched her arms above her head and arched her back, waiting for Alexandra to open the ship up. "Thank you kindly, boss!" she offered with a wriggling of her fingers before heading up the ramp. The Zeltron woman paused near the top of the ramp however, and spun on her heel, bending at the waist so her face could be seen as she smiled out at the pair. "And I promise you, Tor Farlander, one of Fel's own, that since I accepted this assignment, I'll protect you when you're in a pinch." A wink from the Zeltron woman and then Zarinia was inside the ship, presumably out of earshot.

"A lack of blasters does not make one defenseless. Mercy is its own shield..." Speaking lowly to himself, Meqli shakes his head sadly as he shuffles out of the conference room and to where the transport is berthed.
"I've a case for emergency treatment, like radiation burns or onsite surgery. The other is for everyday scrapes and bruises." Meqli explains to Zarinia as he gestures to each case, gliding along just behind her. He scratches at the tip of his long snout, a gesture that seems very childish for one who speaks with such gravity.

Tor looks from the Zeltron woman to the ships captain, the look of puzzlement that has seemingly been a fixture for the Imperial Knight in his dealings with this young woman named Zarinia seems to have reached an entire new level. In a bemused tone, Tor speaks to Alexandra, "My confidence in your abilities with a blaster come into question when I ponder keeping that one on your ship." Tor points in the direction of the ramp Zarinia just went up before continuing, "Surely anyone with a modicum of ability would have hit her with a shot by now. I can not believe you have not taken to shooting her up until now, so it must be your ability with a blaser." With that Tor smiles, and then turns to face the ship again in the direction the Zeltron disappeared up the ramp. "Surely she will test the limits of my patience, may the Force be with us all," he says more to himself than those still outside the ship.

Alex smiled at the humor of Tor's words. It was true that Zarinia could be a bit much top deal with but she had gotten used to it by now. She looked up the ramp following the Knight's gaze and ran a hand through her hair. "I see your point Tor but she is useful to have around. Besides you'll get used to it. You know what though? My dad always said that when I used to give a boy a hard time it meant I like him." She smiled big as she looked back to Tor and then back up the ramp and then back to him again. "And she sure has been giving you a hard time huh?" She chuckled as she sauntered up the ramp to grab her blasters that were hung up at the top of the ramp.

'Well Lunelle,' Granto says after the door has closed behind the last of the others, 'first I must give you this.'
The fian produces a second datacard which he slides across the table.
'All the information available about the situation is on that card. Also a backup of the contact information I provided to miss Davion. Just in case.'
'Second: you are the member of the group with strongest links to the Alliance. So it is to you I turn with my trust to oversee the mission. I do not forsee any problems with your team mates, though I would like you to watch them. In particular the Imperial, for I'm unable to be sure how far he can be trusted. Particularly in this matter when he will clearly see the value of the tibanna gas for his own goverment. Farlander's liberty must not be restricted, with one exception: he cannot be allowed to make contact with Fel and his remnant. Work with your two pilots to ensure that.'
The Admiral nods and smiles absently, turning in his chair to face the holoprojection above the table and tapping the console on the chair's arm to bring up some diagrams of ships in his fleet - status reports, no doubt.
'That's all. You may go join the others.'

Kieran offers up a single wave as the others ignore his comment and start moving off. Tor's request or offer to Ms Davion did not escape notice. *After that oratory and game with Ms Davion it all seems something like compensation or a countermove. In any case it goes in the opposite direction from his outsburst earlier.* As the group spill out into the corridor he also catches some small talk between Zarinia and meqli, but this drifts over his mind - being of less interest than Tor - who he believes to be the most unstable or random element in the group.
The door slid shut and they passed beyond his perception, leaving him with one of the top remaining Admirals in the Alliance. Turning his chair around he relaxes to a neutral expression and Granto begins without delay.
*Ah, there's another one.* He picks up the datacard slid across the table as the Admiral continues onto his request.
'...So it is to you I turn with my trust to oversee the mission...' *What? Like that bunch will follow some person they don't know and haven't been told is their superior?* '...Particularly in this matter when he will clearly see the value of the tibanna gas for his own goverment.' *Then again. Why was he even here?* '...he cannot be allowed to make contact with Fel and his remnant. Work with your two pilots to ensure that.' *sigh…*
"I shall do my best Admiral." Kieran responds as he gets out of his chair, gives parting nod and exits the room.
*Join the others. Hmm… they were wandering off… Ah. Tor wanted preflight with Davion. Hangar.*
Having worked on this particular ship for almost two weeks he knew his way around. Quickly devising a route to the forward section, he ceases standing in middle of the corridor and strides off.

Tor stares stunned at the comment made by Alexandra as she made her way up the ramp before stammering, "I'd just as soon kiss a Wookie!"
As Tor stands there for another moment, he notices Kieran Lunelle enter the hanger deck and make his way towards the ship. Tor eyes the information officer wondering what the conversation could have been between the admiral and Lunelle. *"I wonder what game the admiral is playing now. I believe I can win back the Zeltron and Miss Davion, the Camaasi is sure to like anyone, but this one he may be a problem down the line,"* Tor thinks to himself before calling out to Kieran, "Hail and well met Kieran Lunelle it looks like you will be joining us after all. From yours words in the conference room I had believed our paths would be seperating. You're just in time to get a tour of the ship and help with the pre-launch preparations if you're so inclined." Tor gives a beckoning of his hand as he ends his words and after a brief pause, Tor moves up the ramp and into the YT-2400 himself.

Arriving at the hangar sections much sooner than expected, he was surprised that the first hangar deck he looked in yielded a somewhat dumbfounded looking Farlander at the bottom of a YT-2400's ramp.
*hum.
my last encounter with a 2400 was interesting.*
Just as he begins walking for the the YT-2400, Tor seems to wake from his trance and spots his approach. After another pause Tor calls out loudly - drawing the attention of some working techs before Kieran was even halfway to the ship. By the time he neared the ship Tor had already disappeared up the ramp.
*Geez this person's personality is all over the place.*
Reaching the base of the ramp he swiftly jogs up the ramp to join the others.
"Hello all, it appears that meeting alone by request of an Admiral is somewhat less fatal than I'd imagined." Addressing the group with a light smile, he turns his head to regard Tor "Did something happen in here a moment ago? You were lingering and gazing up the ramp."

Tor turns his head in the direction of the Intelligence Officer and after a beat replies, "What? No. Uh.., Nothing out of the ordinary. I was just trying to recall the last time I was on a YT-2400." The Imperial Knight quickly gathered a thought he could build on before continuing, playing off the earlier comment made by Miss Davion. "Not standard Imperial issue, you know. Always liked this line better than the standard 1300 most space-farers opt for though."
As Tor Farlander finished addressing Kieran, he began thinking of his belongings in the state room that he had spent the last few days in and how his belongings were still there waiting to be claimed. *"Of course I should have gone directly there before venturing to this hangar bay,"* thinks Tor looking over his shoulder in the direction of Lunelle and more promeniently the ramp to the ship he just came up and the hangar outside. *"I will have to make sure I go over all my belongings and search for tamporing, and surveillance. The Fiat Admiral may be on the up and up, but he is a shrewd and tactical opponent. While he may not see a purpose in the outright manufacturing of my immediate demise, he would definitely be one to use information gathered to further his agenda, and I will be damned before I allow him to use me as a tool to gain intelligence on the Emperor and the True Empire. Not the Admiral and certainly not his agent Lunelle, who he must be using; why else hold him back in the conference room!"*
As the storm of thought rages through the mind of the Knight, he eyes Kieran Lunelle with only the slightest hint of suspicion, and awaits the further tour and duties to be given him by the ship's captain.

Zarinia only took a few minutes to glance around the ship before heading straight for her bunk. The moment the door shut behind her the Zelton's expression sighed and a slow not exhale followed. Next Zarinia smiled and grabbed a pillow, happily beating the thing across all manner of panels and outcroppings in the small room before suddenly tossing it behind her and moving for the refresher. "I need some hot water and then, meditation," she drawls to herself.
'Thank the Force that Alex is far more cunning than she looks, the latest honey and sweetness of Farlander is infuriating,' notes the woman to herself as she scrubs her hair, and finally steps out and starts toweling herself off. After a moment, Zarinia just tosses the towel aside, crawls onto her bunk and exhales slowly as she starts to meditate to ease way that passionate Zeltroni nature.

As Tor wanders aimlessly onboard the *Freedom's Wing*, his anxiety over his belongings take their toll on him, pushing him to a point where he feels a need to take action. *"I know I offered to assist with the pre-flight preparations, but I will be able to focus on the present task at hand more thoroughly once I know my belongings are in reach. I should be but a moment."*
Without any word to the other members of the party the Imperial Knight quickly makes his way off the ship and through the hangar bay, barely making an effort to avoid those who may enter the path between his present position and the state room housing his belongings. As Tor makes it to the room he had spent the main duration of his stay in while aboard the *Stargaze*, he reaches out with the Force to examine the room before entering, mindful that while allied in this matter there is no love lost between Emperor Fel's Imperial Remnant and the Galactic Alliance.
Tor quickly gathers his belongings searching them for any signs that tamporing may have occured. *"So help me if Granto had any of his people tampor with my things,"* the Imperial Knight thinks to himself while finally coming across the Long-range com-link w/holo-projector & pocket scrambler he was issued to maintain contact with the Order of the Imperial Knights. *"Even if my belongings were not fooled with, I have no doubt that this room is under surveillance. This is not the place to try and reach anyone within the True Empire to report on the finding of this gas mine. Once aboard the* Freedom's Wing *and safely away from the eyes of the Fiat Admiral and his crew I will have time to make contact."*
As the the Imperial Knight goes to pocket the com-link and gather the remainder of his belongings, a decision forms in his head to ensure his presence is felt by all those he encounters between the present and his departure from this ship. *"These clothes do not speak on the importance of my presence. All will know that an Imperial Knight of Emperor Fel's is aboard this ship from now until my departure."* With that Tor takes off the clothes laid out for him before the meeting in the conference room and puts on his armor; placing the clothes given him in with the rest of his belongings which he quickly gathers up before making his way swiftly back to the hangar deck and the awaiting YT-2400.

We wait in the main section as Captain Davion prepares to show us around. After some pacing around, Farlander finally decides on something and promptly excuses himself. Somewhat bemused, Kieran follows Tor to the bottom of the ramp and watches him stride across the hangar deck at maximum walk speed.
A frown crosses his face as he wonders. *He's really eager for his things…*
He walks back up the ramp, finds Davion and gets straight to business. "I have a message from our employer. We're not to particularly discriminate against Farlander, however we are to prevent him from contacting the Empire. Is your ship's com system is locked for your own access?"

The Caamasi shuffles up the boarding ramp after the others, the two large medical kits on his shoulders swaying wildly. Meqli tries his best to secure the cases, but each of them is nearly as big as he is.
Even with the time he's spent traveling, the lad still finds something novel about life aboard a starship. As he meanders along in search of the ship's medical bay, he runs his fingertips along the ship's surfaces, delighting in the texture. Meqli takes a deep breath, trusting in his acute sense of smell to tell him the ship's story over what his eyes relay.

Alexandra nods and welcomes the Caamasi as he boards the *Wing.* "Welcome aboard." Heading to the cockpit she began to run though some things for preflight. Satisfied she headed back down the hallway to the main area where Kieran spots her and gets her attention. She wasn't surprised to hear the additional words that he relayed form the Admiral.
"Generally no. It's normally just crew aboard but it can be locked out. It might be a good idea to say that we're to keep strict comm silence till we need to rendezvous on orders from the Admiral as we might not know who's listening within the fleet." She ran her left hand through her hair as her right fell habitually to her blaster where she rested her hand. "I'll let the others know." she turned on her heel and went back to the cockpit where she entered the locking codes into the comm systems keeping all but the best slicers out. "That should do it." She said to herself.

The automated doors slide open to the room that Zarinia uses. The woman is dressed, thankfully, as she steps out, though she does pad along shoeless and her hair is still wet from the time within the refresher. Making her way to the bridge, Zarinia fidgets a little with the jacket she wears, before sliding into the co-pilot's seat. "Okay, don't tell anyone else," she admits to Alexandra with a wink, "But I just couldn't bring myself to make you do all the work," is stated in a soft whisper.
"Where are we at, Captain? Are we departing right away? Is everyone on board? And am I still forbidden from putting my feet up on the console?" asks Zari, her tone filled with amusement at the last even as her eyes glance over the controls on her side, along with the readouts, as she works her own preparations for take-off in conjunction with the Captain.

With Ms Davion being thoroughly professional and cooperative, that was one small issue out of the way. The Captain wandered off to the cockpit leaving Kieran leaning against a wall with his arms crossed. He lets his mind drift once again and assesses the situation.
*The smuggler duo are on their ship and tending to their shiply things. A'kla I think I saw wandering the ship while I was waiting and Farlander pacing. Finally the fair knight himself, who feels naked without his belongings and/or is paranoid about leaving them unattended.*
*Well. I know the feeling.* As Zarinia wanders by he uncrosses his arms and puts his hands on his hips, feeling his thorough lack of utility belt.
*He'll probably be back with his gear. And one of those damn lightsabers…* crossing his arms again and frowning his mind trundles on. *He could be very dangerous, but he wouldn't start something before we even leave. No point in running off to get my own things. I'm sure I can find something to do.*
He walked over to the cockpit section junction and called out to the pair in front "Hello. We may not be leaving till tomorrow morning, but is there anything I can help with before then? I've maintained and flown my own ship for a few years so I know what I'm doing, but it wasn't a career requirement like the two of you." *Probably should let them know some of my skills* "I'm probably best used on sensor and comm boards... and computers and astronav."

As Tor makes his way back through the hanger bay, he is aware of the glares he receives while wearing his Imperial Knight armor by the technicians of the Fiat Admiral's staff. Tor fights the smirk forming on his face at their uncomfort with his presence thinking to himself, *"As if it has been a great joy for me these last few days surrounded by the Alliance Remnant."*
Farlander reaches the waiting YT-2400 and enters the ship making sure to give one last look back at the assembled Alliance crew before disappearing into the reaches of the ship. As the Imperial Knight makes his way towards the cockpit in search of Ms. Davion to let her know he has returned and is ready to assist with the pre-flight preparations, he overhears the end of Kieran's remarks on what he is capable of running on the ship. As the Intelligence officer finishes speaking Tor reaches the cockpit area and pats Kieran on the back before stating, "I have no doubt our friend here will be able to use the comm system capably, *sending and receiving information* and all that." Tor gives a wink at this comment in the direction of no one in particular before facing the smuggler captain and continuing, "Now Ms. Davion, will there be accomodations aboard this ship for us individually or does the crew need to share space? Either way I would like to store my belongings so I can ably assist you in preparing for our noble adventure."

Zarinia looks up slowly from some readout she was observing to peer over at the Imperial Knight. She pauses a moment, putting a hand to her chin, and letting those emerald eyes rake over the man curiously before shaking her head. "I never could stand armor. It restricts movement too much, no matter how well designed. And while you get noticed in red armor, you also get _noticed_ in that armor. This is a covert mission, Sir, and if we run into someone on this abandoned mining platform, let's keep a few cards up our sleeves and not announce we have one or more Force Users in our group, mmmm?" she suggests.
That said, Zari turns to the Captain and smiles sweetly, "Please don't make me bunk with him. Just trust me on that one," she says, before stretching in her chair and wriggling her unfettered and uncovered toes. "And hey, thanks," notes the Zeltroni woman as she turns to Keiran with a smile. "Extra eyes are useful, extra hands only spoil the Bantha Broth, though. If the Captain says stop or out, I expect you to listen to her, even if you think you're right, or even if you ARE right. Frustrating the pilot tends to get you crash-landed on some obscure planet like Dagobah or something." There if a faint pause before Zari's eyes turn to Farlander. "That means you, too."

Alexandra smiled at Zarinia. "No you don't have to bunk with him. That's the last kind of headache I need." She looks to the others that are around as she jerks a thumb at her co-pilot. "And she tends to exaggerate but only a little." She said with a sly smile.
Accommodations now that was something else. "Tor," she says to the Imp Knight. "There are accommodation's but they are nothing to holo home about. We'll be comfortable enough." She say in the pilots chair. As far as stations if tings get rough Zarinia and I are fine here in the cockpit. Someone in the engine room who at least knows the right end of a hydrospanner to use would be optimal. And one or two to man the two turrets. With the five of us that should cover the basics."
She looked out through the cockpit glass over the hanger deck that was filled but running smoothly. "I'm not sure when the Admiral want to kick us off his nice little warship here but I'd like to be ready to go at a moments notice."
She knew getting there wouldn't be much of a problem it what they found when they got there that bothered her. But a job was a job even though this was no ordinary job. The stakes could me much higher here. Higher stakes meant a bigger payoff but also greater risk. Funny how thew two go hand in hand.

Damn, that was fast. He had heard him coming from the direction of the boarding ramp and a flash of irritation ran through his mind as he was clapped on the back. He adjusts himself to stand in the corridor sidelong as Tor begins another oratory.
Kieran listens to the crew of the Freedom's Wing, feeling rather diverted away from the cockpit. While he understands the courtesy of listening to the ship's captain, the computer engineer feels somewhat irked at not securing a computer related task. None of his irritation shows on his face however.
"Well, I'm a qualified engineer but I'm a lot better with sensors and astronav. With your permission I'd to operate the sensor systems when we're approaching this backup station or poking around the gas giant. I'd feel a lot better knowing as much I can before exploring on foot."

The ship's comm control emits a beeping alert. When Captain Davion responds to it she receives a succinct missive from the hangar controlâ€“a delivery of survey and survival equipment, food, drink, and medical supplies stands ready outside the ship to be taken on board.
'You are cleared for departure once the preparations of your team are complete,' the message ends.
The delivery, when brought aboard, amounts to thisâ€“?enough rations to last you three weeks, a pair of medical kits (complete with a small supply of bacta for topical treatment of minor wounds), a surgery kit, ten medpacs, three field kits, camo fatigues for each of you, several coils of syntherope, a sensor pack, a video recorder, a pair of electrobinoculars, and a power generator. Your own equipment not withstanding, it should provide for any eventuality that could be predicted.
Within the hour all personal belongings wanted aboard are brought aboard and nothing else stands in the way of take-off. Control acknowledges Alexandra's request and reaffirms clearance, and the pilot brings her YT-2400 smoothly out of the hangar. Once away from the Alliance fleet, the necessary hyperspace coordinates are programmed in and the *Freedom's Wing* makes the jump to hyperspace.

It is several days later that the *Freedom's Wing* reappear in realspace nearby Abatrarg and its eighteen orbiting moons.

Just before the Freedom's Wing jumps out of hyperspace, Zarinia slips out of her quarters wearing the camoflague fatigues provided before the ship departed. Stretching, the Zeltroni woman slips back into the cockpit, testing this, that and the other of the clothing before lifting her legs as she settles into a chair and wriggling her toes. "I really do hate brekaing in a new pair of boots," she notes almost flippantly, adjusting in her seat. "But it WAS so awfully nice of the admiral to give us new clothing. And I hear camoflague is all the rage this galactic cycle."
Swivelling into position at the co-pilot's chair, Zarinia glances over the controls, making certain is all in order, before she flashes a smile over at Alexandra. "So, Captain. What's the plan?"

### **Yogi** (2008-06-03 01:28:19)

The supplies were a welcome addition to the mission. Alexandra ws sure that they would come in handy on the station. Hoping that this little mission would go smoothly was all well and good but it didn't hurt to be well prepared for the worst.
She hated to admit it but when she left the hanger bay she felt a sense of relief. While she knew that she was safe there she just felt safer at the controls of the *Wing.* When it was her own skills and talent that kept her alive. Looking at her co-pilot she knew she had good one here with her. As for the others time would tell. One thing was for sure they would get to know each other better on the trip to Abatrang.
She smiled at Zarinia. "Well for starters lets not be too lax. We have no idea what were flying into. As soon as we drop from hyperspace lets do a passive scan of the area and see what we can find and then take the *Wing* in. We haven't made it this far by just flying in blind. And lets make sure the guns are manned just in case. " Being prepared was never a bad thing.
------------------------------------------
Once in hyperspace she began to run diagnostics on some of the ships systems. It was a routine that kept her busy on longer jumps and it kept her busy. Besides tinkering with the sublight, hyperdrive, weapon systems or whatever she felt like always made her happy.
Upon exiting in system she ran a passive scan of the area and pinpointed the location of the station. "Alright lets get the guns and the engine room manned for the approach." Putting the sublight drives to full power she move the *Wing* farther into the system.

Prior to departure Kieran helped to stow the newly supplied equipment and collected his possessions from the neat but randomly arranged pile of boxes that the deck crew had raided the cabins with. Once underway he checks and inventories the supplies, familiarised himself with the ship. During the trip, when not working he was often be found in the corridors or common areas sitting and working on one or more of his assorted pieces of equipment.
====================================
Shortly before reversion from hyperspace Kieran changes into his fatigues and after donning his gear sits in the rear of the saucer section, outside the small engine room. Serious faced he silently watches for changes in the the displays and listens for changes in the ship.
