**"Remember, out there you represent the company. Keep that in mind,"** his CO drawls as Tak scoops his datacards and the offered cred-chip. The grizzled older human runs a hand over his bristly shaved head looking more tired and old than Tak had ever seen him before. He looks up at Tak from behind his desk cluttered with mission specs and blaster parts. His eyes say that he knows his words are going to fall on deaf ears, but he says them anyway, **"You're a fool. You go there for honor, or glory, or what ever the hell you want to call it. All you're gonna get is broken or dead. Gladiator's life is no life son. It's an end to one. When you get smart we'll be here with a place for ya."** The dismissal plain, Tak takes his leave of the CO's office and soon of the company's HQ and planet.
On board the transport to Killee-Kor Tak gets his first taste of Arena life. Two other passengers are bound for the pits as well, and a group of well dressed beings do little but talk of the Arenas all the way there, discussing odds, tiers, different pits, by-gone gladiators and up and comers. The anticipation and dread waft through the ship in equal amounts.
Zuur, a Trandoshan wrestler from the GWL, and Rijah, a Trianni trick-shot from Nar Shadda, sit around the holo-game board in the mess of the mid-size freighter with Tak, enjoying the break from the spectators they'd been traveling with. With less than a day before landing, the three eat in relative silence. As Zuur finishes his meal of mostly raw meat he sits back contentedly, slitted eyes traveling from one future gladiator to another, and asks, in flawless Basic, **"Any plans or strategies prepared? I'll be heading towards the south of the city myself, to begin with. I hear lodging is cheaper there."**
