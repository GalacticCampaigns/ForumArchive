# The Tale of the Furry Fury

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-01-31 21:36:29)

*With the entire Galaxy shrouded in a cloak of pure darkness, and corruption and crime almost as present as military forces everywhere, it should come as no surprise to anyone that criminal elements that flourished even before Darth Krayt´s rise to power - such as slave trades - is doing quite well. With corrupt law enforcement bribed all the time and might making right, this ancient practice is doing very well, and many smaller groups have emerged making it their primary purpose.
Not all slaves are found in the hands of such underground elements though. A particularly ferocious Wookie slave have recently been apprehended on board the Imperial Star Destroyer* Rampage*, and have been kept under a pretty tight leash. A combination of massive doses of sedation, physical punishment and metallic restraints have been keeping even this particular specimen in check, and what was once a rare occurrence of albino fur is now half covered in dried blood stains and dark patches of scorched hair.
This is where our tale begins…*
((OK, so you start out in your holding cell, and as you might guess you´ll have no starting equipment at hand, though your personal effects is around somewhere. I´ll look into working with some kind of translator droid, but for the moment you´ll have to do without one - Imperials aren´t likely to be interested in speaking too much with you anyway <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->))

His head was groggy, his vision blurred, but he was conscious and with his manacled hands, the bloodied wookiee pushed himself to his feet and looked around the cell, giving himself a chance to fully regain his focus. Time had been lost on him, he had lost track of how long he had been bagged for, the only cue to his location, the screams of the other prisoners above the hum of the protective shield of his cell, that was all before they started on him. He had endured more from previous masters but his captor's were still holding back...they hadn't started removing his limbs, at least not yet.
Moving over to the entrance way, he looked boths ways, trying to see if there was anything he could take in, before letting out a roar, which resulted in a mere croak compared to his normal battle cry. Nevertheless for anyone that understood his native tongue, they would understand his fury and chuckle at his derogatory expletive towards his captors.

OOC: Can I make a strength check(?) to break any restraints imposed on me? And any other checks to regain full mental composure?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-02 11:44:41)

Looking out through the small viewport in his cell door, the Wookie couldn´t really understand why it was there. The only thing he could see were a very narrow section of the corridor his cell was located in, a clinically dull environment of typical Imperial design, with cell doors just like his arranged along the walls. Whether it was due to the physical conditions of the inhabitants of those cells, or soundproof construction, the silence was prevailing, and even a Wookie roar was unlikely to be heard by anyone but himself. Perhaps this was the point behind having the small window in the cell doors though, to allow inmates to look outside and find nothing but despair.
((I had originally not intended for you to have any kind of restraints while *in the cell*, but since you went ahead and gave yourself some, consider yourself cuffed <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> And yes, you can attempt to break restraints or pretty much anything using a Strength check.
And no, you may not make any kind of check to restore yourself to full mental composure, as you aren´t in any way suffering from any penalties whatsoever))

### **jaybee3** (2012-02-03 04:12:42)

Jaadyr began to pace back and forth in the tiny space assigned to, rage building over any feeling of despair he might have been facing. He was comfortable with anger, he flourished in it and in the heat of battle he felt invincible as he tore the heads off countless foes as if they nothing more than delicate flowers in the meadows of Naboo. He looked around his cell to see if there was any other exit or something he could use if the guards came knocking again, before summoning his strength from within and trying to snap the manacles that bound his wrists.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-12 18:38:26)

The Empire - in all the forms it has manifested in during the millenniums - have never been known to treat non-humans with much respect, and even if this Sith Empire fares much better in that respect, what with having several non-humans as high-ranking Sith lords, this improvement doesn´t seem to extend to captured prisoners.
The cell is completely empty, with clinically smooth walls and ceiling, all to further the feeling of despair that surely grips a lot of people placed in there. As the increasingly furious Wookie exerts his strength on the manacles holding him, he found the restraints more than enough to contain him. Obviously someone had been thinking before they locked him up.
Suddenly he hears outside the door, and as it slides open, he spots a creature that looks like it could have been picked right out of the slums on Nar Shadaa standing in the doorway. Most of its features are hidden underneath a dirty and tattered cloak, and most parts of the face is covered by a pulled up hood. He can however see the lower portion of the face, and he sees a smile on the creatures lips.
**"Hey there…care for some company?"**

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-02-12 19:03:19)

The shackled wookiee lets out a roar of confusion at seeing his cell's curious new entrant. *'Free me? Why'* He thinks to himself at the possibility of having to pay off another Life Debt to his saviour. He nods to the stranger and hushes his voice, before questioning him to see if he could understand his native tongue.
**"I'm Jaadyr. Who be you?"**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-12 21:03:50)

The creature´s smile widens, and he takes a few steps into the cell, and the door slams shut behind him. This close Jaadyr can see that he was in fact a slightly hunched humanoid male, though when he stands tall he is still a little short of the massive stature of the Wookie. As he pulls back the hood of his cloak he reveals a weathered and shaven face, with a patch of cloth draped across his eyes, and patches of white hair lining the sides of his head, with a bald spot on the top.
**"Who I am, young Wookie, depends on what you want me to be. Should you wish it, I can be the one that sets you free of this place. But I could also be your bane, come to deliver you to the afterlife, if that is the kind of release you seek"**
He fell silent, and even though the mans eyes were covered in cloth, Jaadyr felt as if he was staring straight at him.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-02-13 01:50:08)

**"Funni lookin' 'ooman, you be! If you kill me now, sobeit I live long enough, but grant I one last wish: Let I sate bloodlust on I's captors!"** The mighty furred warrior bellowed banging his chest. Looking from the state of the man in front of him, he felt that ripping him limb from limb wasn't his best solution if he was offering him salvation, however brief it may be.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-13 10:41:39)

The old man chuckles, and his smile widens even more.
**"Now now, I have no intention to kill you. Such a waste that would be. But I have to ask you, who are your captors, really? The crew on this ship is only doing their job, apprehending escaped fugitives in accordance with their orders. And if you wish for me to bring you back to where you were before you got here, that would seem like quite the distance to go for…what? A revenge that I doubt you and I alone could extract?"**
He tilted his head slightly backwards, and once again Jaadyr felt as if the mans eyes were gazing straight at him from behind the cloth.
**"No, my friend, I would say that you are your own captor. You trap yourself in a cage of rage, one that restricts what you can do in your life, and - if I´m not mistaken - is responsible for your current predicament. Even now I can feel it in you, growing. Somewhere, perhaps even unconsciously, you think that perhaps you should just rip me apart to make me stop talk, and go back to the life you´ve always known. It is your nature.
But you have restrained this urge, reasoning that I might have something worthwhile to offer. I do. I offer to help you control this rage, that you may escape the cage it traps you in and become truly free. I offer to teach you how to use it to become more than you have ever been. I offer to elevate you above the ranks of the rest of the Galaxy. And all I ask in exchange is that you serve me, not as a slave, but as a soldier. What do you say?"**
The smile in the mans face changed into a wide grin, both taunting and inviting at the same time.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-27 18:06:49)

Several long moments passes as the man remains in utter silence, observing the Wookie in front of him, his smile passing away eventually. When it seems snough time have passed, he adjusts the hood on his cloak, and starts to leave the cell. As he exits the door, he turns back to look at Jaadyr.
**"Think about what I offer, young Wookie. You may think yourself strong, but can you endure centuries in captivity, doomed to rot away in some jail cell or work colony, only to eventually have the longevity of your species fail you, at which point you will have nothing to leave behind you other than a life of slavery and captivity"**
With those words, the man leaves the cell, and the door slams shut behind him as he does so, and Jaadyr is left alone once again in the confines of his cell.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-01 03:35:44)

The wookiee thought long about what the man offered after he'd disappeared through the door. *'He offers me power? But in exchange for servitude? I've known no other life.'* Jaadyr paced for a few moments, one step quickly covereing the distance between the two walls of the cell. *'Damnit. I'm going to be trapped in here forever…it's an offer I can't refuse in my predicament….'* The nearly bicentigenarian thrashed out, smacking the door with his hands in annoyance.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-06 09:57:49)

Much to the surprise of the big Wookie, the door responded to his smash not by deforming or being dented (which would have been a feat of strength even for a Wookie), but by opening. quickly and quietly it slid up, leaving him with nothing in between him and the corridor outside.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-06 11:26:02)

A puzzled look shot across the wookiee's face as the door slid open and he couldn't help but scratch his head with his shovel like paws. Peering his head around into the corridor, he looked down it, checking to see if the coast was clear, while listening out for any other noises. The wookiee was cautious, blissfully aware that he could be falling straight into a trap.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-09 07:12:19)

Taking a few moments to look outside his cell, Jaadyr didn´t see a thing, and the only thing he could hear was a soft humming from something. An airconditioner or nearby power generator perhaps. But as far as he could tell, he was completely alone.
((OK, so just to give you a general idea of your surroundings, they look something like this:

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-22 10:17:26)

Deciding that there wasn't anything of note in the other cells, except for other potential captives in a worse state than himself, Jaadyr moved with uncanny speed through the corridors to the main hallway, stopping just before it to peek round the corners once more to check if it was safe to move on. He was busily formulating a plan of escape, or at least as much of one his brain could muster outside of wanton bloodlust. *'Get to the bridge. Hold ship hostage. Or get to escape pod. Take chances against big guns. Either way. Get off ship and find funny lookin' creature again. Deal good afterall.'*

```

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-26 19:27:42)

Perhaps it was the rush of adrenaline making its way into his system, or perhaps it was just the haste he wished to make in getting off the ship, but as Jaadyr pokes his head out from behind the corner, he finds himself face to face with a pair of white-armored stormtroopers, blaster rifles at the ready. They appear to be as surprised to see him as he is to see them however, and for a split second no one makes a move.
((
Luckily for you they botched their Perception check to notice you, so no one go a surprise round on the other. Please include an Initiative check in your next post.
))

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-27 08:06:55)

The wookiee's eyes widened as he came into contact with his first foe since his release. He could feel his rage brewing as the emotions from weeks of torture bubbled to the surface and he let out an angry snort much like a reek before it charges. His muscles tensed, he cracked a wicked smile as he awaited the first move in this rodian standoff.
Seconds later and a twitch from one of the troopers, the wookiee sent his fists flying at the closest stormtrooper.

Both sides genuinely seemed equally surprised at each others presence, but unluckily for the stormtroopers, the Wookie is the first one to regain his senses. Not so much running as it may be called leaping, he closes the distance to one of the troopers with his fist leading. More on sheer instinct and luck than any real skill though, the trooper manages to back up just enough to avoid the thrashing Wookies blows. He fires his own rifle in slight panic, but his unbalance and nonexistent aiming sends the shots into the ceiling.
The vicious series of blows comes to an end though when a new series of blaster bolts erupts from behind Jaadyr, one passing very close to his shoulder. The second trooper had moved in behind him, into a flanking position, and he was now trapped between the two of them. And, he could only guess, they had to be calling for backup on their helmet comms rather frequently.
((
Don´t read anything mechanical into my use of the word flanking, it just happens to be the best way of describing the scene I could think of. You lost 18 HP to that attack.
))

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-29 04:26:29)

The nearly-bicentigenarian Wookiee let out an angry grunt as the laser fire singed his coat, adding to the already patchwork design of white and burnt oche fur. Whirling towards the storm trooper who'd let off the hail of blasterbolts, he sent an elbow towards his head, before following it up quickly with a gut shot. *'I need to deal with this lot quickly….it won't be long before others come. Damn my haste!'*

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-29 20:43:48)

With big steps, the massive Wookie reaches his assailant in a single bound, ramming his skull with his elbow, and with a powerful blow to the gut he sends the trooper slumping down against the wall. The second trooper seems to have regained his composure from the initial shock, and as he backs down the corridor, firing, the metallic voice coming through his helmet speakers calls out for Jaadyr to stand down. It is impossible to tell if the fact that the shots are going into the ceiling again because he is intentionally trying not to hit the escaped prisoner or if he just hasn´t calmed down just yet.
((
That stormtrooper were not in melee range, so it cost you your Move action as well to reach him. You did, however, take him down, so you gain 4 bonus HP. The other trooper kept moving away from you, though he is still in range with 1 Move action.
))

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-30 07:35:28)

The Wookiee couldn't resist maintaining his fury any more and let out a battle cry as he rounded on his initial target once more, whose shots seemed to be floudering. He decided that he wouldn't let him fire off another series of shots and bounded towards him with his massive gait, leaping on the last step his hands clasped together aiming to deal a hammerblow to the trooper's skull.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-31 00:16:00)

Taken by surprise by the speed of the massive Wookie, the trooper instinctively raises his arms and weapon above his head to protect himself rather than completing his aim and firing. His efforts are futile though, as the reach of the Wookie is too great, and the soldier slumps to the ground with the powerful blow even causing a small dent in his helmet.
With both troopers down for the count, the cell block once again falls eerily quiet, though only a fool would expect that to remain the same for too long.
((
Please list your bonus hit points separate from your other hit points (like 70+4 instead of 74), as they will go away at the end of an encounter.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-31 07:12:41)

Jaadyr breathed a huge sigh of relief before he began to rummage around in the helmet of the storm trooper trying to detach the communication device so he could at least have some intelligence on the enemy movements.
Taking a step back, he looked above him for an access hatch to escape into and at least lie low or ambush anyone else that came.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-04-01 03:48:36)

As the Wookie pulls the helmet of the trooper, he notices a low buzzing sound echoing from it. It seems the powerful blow he handed his foe did some damage to the helmets comm systems, and he can´t really make out anything being said in the channel. The other helmet is still intact though, but he really have no idea on how to get out the comm unit anyway, so he is restricted to holding it up to his ear to listen in on the comm, since the helmets clearly wasn´t designed with Wookies in mind.
What he can hear is the rapid chatter of a drilled response team quickly mobilizing, and from what he can hear they are assembling near something called the "dump chute", whatever that means. Taking a quick look in the ceiling above him, he finds nothing like an access hatch, or anything else. Apart from the recent carbon scoring, it is is sterile and clean as the rest of the cell block.
As he looks around in the different directions of the corridor, he notices one end running for about 15 meters and then ending in a massive blast door. The other one, the one the troopers came from, runs for about as long before it bends to the left.
((
No, they go away at the end of an encounter. They are meant to provide some extra power without healing you. Kind of like getting an adrenaline rush, you still need to be patched up once you settle down. They also don´t stack, meaning that you can only ever have 4 at max.
In case it was in question, the troopers you encountered came from the right section of the map I made before.
))

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-10 12:29:02)

*'Grr looks like I threw rocks at a nest of mynocks!'* The wookiee mentally cursed himself for not finishing the battle quicker and not relying on a little stealth to get it done. Since time was now of the essense, he looks left and right once more. Deciding that blast door were generally dead ends for those without the right "tools" to get through them, he heads in the direction the troopers came from. He slows his bounding footsteps and creeps up to the corner for a look around it to see if there is another group of troopers for him to just bump into.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-04-12 22:54:28)

As he creeps up on the corner, Jaadyr peeks out around it, and to his relief, he doesn´t spot anyone on the hallway. It is more narrow than the earlier sections and stretches on for about a hundred meters or so, and he can spot several doors on the left side of it.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-13 12:06:13)

The wookiee continues to move cautiously along the corridor stopping before the first door, checking to see if it has a viewport he can peer through. If not he'll put his ear to the door in an attempt to listen for anything on the other side.
((

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-04-18 19:30:32)

As the Wookie creeps forward along the wall, he notices that the first door is open. As he can hear no sounds coming from the inside, he takes a quick peek, and as he can spot no one inside the room, he enters. The room is relatively small (though still larger than his accommodations for the last time have been), and from the looks of it, the room serves as barracks for the troopers serving in the cell block. As he looks around, he finds only beds and low-security lockers, making it seem likely that any gear is kept somewhere else. Judging by the number of bunks and lockers in the room, he would say it is inhabited by four troopers at a time.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-06-01 03:36:14)

Disatisfied with the lack of loot in the pristine Imperial barracks, Jaadyr let out a snort before backing out back onto the corridor. *'….damn lockers….smash?!…no too much attention……might set off alarm.'* He would then continue cautiously on his way, making a quick check in each room before crossing in front of it.
