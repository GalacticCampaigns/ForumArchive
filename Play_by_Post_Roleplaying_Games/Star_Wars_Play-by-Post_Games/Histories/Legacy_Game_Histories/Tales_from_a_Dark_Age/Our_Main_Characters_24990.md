**Backround**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jakira grew up the daughter of a cybernetics surgeon and a nurse, Jahn and Dejah Boton. While she was never expected to follow her family into medicine her parents took advantage of her growing interest in the profession to keep their daughter out of trouble. Learning the trade from an early age from her parents clinic her passion for the healing arts only grew. Attending a prestigious medical school she quickly rose to the top of her class and upon graduation was accepted to work in a hospital on Coruscant. Accepting the offer she spent her internship there. In secret she craved to learn more about the bio-implants the Vong had introduced to the galaxy and sought out someone to teach her. When her parents decided to retire from their lucrative business and move to a more remote area of their homeworld, Zeltros, they offered the clinic to Jakira. With the Darth Krayt's Empire frimly entrenched on Coruscant and her home steadily becoming an unbearbly bleak place she took the offer gladly.
Leaving the hospital on Bastion, Jakira returned to the the clinic where her passion had grown and began the management of her family's business. Cajoling a reputable doctor to join her, she allowed him to handle most of the patients while she managed the office. With a good deal of her time now free, she continued in her extracurricular learning. After a year she sold the clinic taking her earnings to start up a new clinic on Solsis VII. Moving there she knew she was in for some hard times. The backwater planet was just emerging, but with her hospital being amoung the first to sprout up on the Sith subjugated planet the natives came to depend on the services she provided. Using the hospital as a front, she worked on helping as many of the Force Sensitive Hobben's to escape from the Sith's grasp.
With the arrival of Feeorin's captian Kurr's No Chance leading a vindictive Sith Assassin unawares to the hapless planet, events would turn against the young Zeltron doctor. As the injured Wes took refuge in the hospital as he recovered from his ordeals after being revived from hibernation, the assassin tracked the ship to the planet and subsequently to the sanctuary of the hospital. During the night, the Sith Assassin with the help of the local Sith governor attacked the hospital in search of Wes and the oboulette the Mandalorian warrior had been confined in for centuries. The Hobben leaders, hiding in the catacombs of the temple turned hospital managed to escape into the vast jungles of Solsis with the obilette and the crew of the No Chance, Jakira, and any straggling Hobben they managed to find.
The group spent the next week hiding in the hazardous jungles, dodging Sith and the fauna equally. Taking refuge in the grove of sacred San'ati, the Force Senstive Hobben leaders made their stand, forming the Pure Song, their spirits combined in the Force and with their combined strength was able to overcome the Sith assassin. Sacrificing themselves, most of the Hobben Elders passed into the Force, as well as the Voice of Ali'la and Jakira's greatest friend, Mahchen. With their recent adversary defeated, the crew of the No Chance fights their way past the remaining Sith garrison under the leadership of Governor Radge Rothke. Now wanted by the Sith governor on his own vendetta, Jakira leaves the planet, albeit unwillingly, she had come to call home.

**Description**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jakira is 25 years old and sports a dark crimson skin tone with light pink almost white hair. Generally her stylishly cut, shoulder length hair is hanging free, but she's been known to pull it back with a hair tie she wears as a bracelet when the need arises. Wearing a skimpy, tight fitting top, she uses her appearance and the allure of her people to her advantage. When the time arises for her to work, she has a smock which covers her to her knees. To a casual observer she carries no weapons, though a hold-out blaster is tucked securely in one of her high boots.
Being jovial and sometimes even flippant, Jakira has learned over the years how to manipulate people when it suited her. Though she is rather promiscuous and can be a player, she becomes very serious when there are people in need of her help.

*Sling purchased as a holster.
*Concealed holster in located in the right vambrace that covers his right forearm. The holster is spring loaded tinamous for faster access.
**Background:**
On a Galactic Alliance planet that he didn't even know the name of, his Clan was contracted out to hold a facility while GA military evacuated personnel and civilians. Why the civilians were there Wes had no idea. They should not have been in the middle of a war zone. Something about scientists but Wes had no use for scientists.
Communications were out. Ionization in the atmosphere drastically reduced the range of communications. Wes was holding position watching for any Vong. The optics in his helmet provided him with excellent visibility in the near dark area.
"Buir, you think the Vongese will come this way." Wes said to his Father over the helmet comms.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Buir = father / Vongese = Vong

</details>

His father didn't say anything. All Wes saw was the nod of the helmet his father wore.
The other armored warrior in the room spoke. Wes heard her voice over his helmet comms. "Let them come. Ib'tuur jatne tuur ash'ad kyr'amu." Wes smiled though no one saw it. For his mother spoke the truth. For even through they were only three. Three Mandolorian warriors were equal to a platoon of GA troopers.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ib'tuur jatne tuur ash'ad kyr'amur = Today is a good day for someone else to die.

</details>

Wes shifted the environmental controls that regulated his armor kicked on. Providing cooled air to offset the hot environment outside.
"Ad'ika, run the perimeter." He heard his father say. Wes clicked his comm. to signal that he heard and understood.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ad'ika = lad, boy

</details>

Wes ran the outlying perimeter. At the extreme range of his comlink, where he could still barely reach his parents due to the diminished signal, he got the call they the Vongese were advancing on his parent's position. Wes commed for help relaying the position of the attacking force to the GA personnel. And with best possible speed made his way back. He hadn't gone more than ten feet when the first thud bug hit his helmet. His armor, which was his life, protected him from that hit and the others at followed.
His blaster carbine answered back. His first shot took the lead Vongese in the head and the warrior fell forward head first into the soil. The dust cloud, that the body's impact raised, was quickly swept away buy the warriors second and third companions as they rushed past their fallen comrade.
Wes gave them credit. Most would have paused from seeing that but the Vongese were warriors like him. He had a fight on his hands. The smile beneath his helmet, if the Vongese could have seen it, would have given them pause.
The battle between them raged. Wes tried to contact the others but his comm. fizzled out due to the ionization or damage. The second warrior dropped to several shots but the last was in close now. Amphistaff and armor collided. The living weapon continually tried to find a way past the dense Mando armor.
Wes managed to finally get an armored hand around the warrior's neck. Through repeated bludgeoning with the other hand the Vongese finally lay still. Wes rolled off the dead body. His black and gray armor was covered with his enemys blood.
Standing he made his way back to the position his parents were holding. The sound of battle could still be heard. Quickening his pace even more he arrived on scene. The place was crawling with GA troopers and Vongese in a pitched battle. Seeing the intense melee Wes entered it his blaster carbine firing away. He went through his remaining power packs. By the time the last Vongese dropped Wes was nearly out of ammunition.
The adrenaline of battle still surged within him as he looked for his parents. What shocked him was that they were nowhere to be seen. What he saw when he did find them nearly made the battle hardened Mando retch. His father lay dead fallen over the still body of his mother. Both had pieces of armor missing. Part of his father's breastplate was mission and his mother's helmet was off. Her cause of death was obvious, massive trauma to the head. Around them lay more than a dozen dead Vongese warriors, a testament to their courage in battle.
When all was said and done, payment was received Wes left the planet with his parents. He took them home to Mandalore where they received a warriorâ€™s funeral.
The war was soon over. With noting to keep him on Mandalore he left. He felt as if he didn't belong there with his clanmates. Not then, maybe never.
-----------------------------------
It didn't take long for Wes to find a job. Some old human on a back water planet needed some help dealing with some pirates that had been harassing him for several months. It seemed to be an easy enough job. Kill a few pirates make some credits to afford a few more modifications to his armor. Then move on to the next job. It all changed when he arrived and talked to the old man.
"Thank you for coming Mr. Del-Fin. The job I requested you for is most important." The man seemed almost too old to be living. Something about the man was unnerving though. As if he didn't need help in dealing with any trouble that may come his way.
Wes simply stood there all the old man could see was his own reflection off the armored helmet. "Yes I know you've been bothered by some pirates. I know how to deal with them." He moved the blaster carbine that always at his side.
The old man smiled. "Yes I am sure that you do. But I have seen something that is disturbing. Something in the future that will come to pass, help there you can. You have an ability that is as of yet unrecognized...they will need you."
As the man spoke a ominous shiver ran down Wes's spine. *What in karking hell is he talking about? He's daft.* Wes thought as he took a step back. Something he had never done to another person before. The old man continued.
"Yes you will be needed." Sensing some sort of danger Wes began to raise his carbine. But the old man moved quicker. If his eyes were visible disbelief would have been seen in his eyes. Wes felt himself begin to loose consciousness. Fighting against it he stumbled to a table in the sparse room. Unable to fight it any longer he slumped over the table. The weight of the man and the armor crushed the table and he fell to the floor.
The old man shuffled up to the fallen Mando a look of grim sadness on his face. "I am sorry my young friend. If things were different I would have trained you myself. Now someone else will have to find that potential that you hold. But alas that will be many years from now.
Wes was removed from his armor and taken to the lower levels of the old mans dwelling. He was placed carefully in a chamber. "Here you will sleep for the next century young Wes. When you awaken you will be needed. Live up to your heritage and your destiny and become a Jedi."
-------------------------------
With the arrival of the No chance on Solsis IIV the group thought they had found a place to lay low and effect repairs on ship that had just been acquired by the pirate Kurr. As the injured Wes took refuge in the hospital as he recovered from his ordeals after being revived from hibernation, the Sith assassin fron the Wheel tracked the ship to the planet and subsequently to the sanctuary of the hospital. During the night, the Sith Assassin with the help of the local Sith governor attacked the hospital in search of Wes and the oboulette the Mandalorian warrior had been confined in for centuries. The Hobben leaders, hiding in the catacombs of the temple turned hospital managed to escape into the vast jungles of Solsis with the obilette and the crew of the No Chance, Jakira, and any straggling Hobben they managed to find.
The group spent the next week hiding in the hazardous jungles, dodging Sith and the fauna equally. Taking refuge in the grove of sacred San'ati, the Force Senstive Hobben leaders made their stand, forming the Pure Song, their spirits combined in the Force and with their combined strength was able to overcome the Sith assassin. Sacrificing themselves, most of the Hobben Elders passed into the Force. With their recent adversary defeated, the crew of the No Chance fights their way past the remaining Sith garrison under the leadership of Governor Radge Rothke. Now hunted by the Sith governor on his own vendetta, the group leaves the planet that had hoped to find a little bit of sanctuary on.
A week later the No Chance set down on a mid rim world to take on some supplies. With Wes, Jakira and Kurr grating on each others nerves till they were raw. It was a welcome thought to get off the ship for a while so Wes and Jakira left the ship to take a walk alone. Unbeknown to them pirate had other plans and pulled up the boarding ramp leaving the pair behind. Stranded Jakira did what she does best and finds them a place to say and relax in each others company for a while.
**Personality:**
Wes is a loner Mandalorian to the core. Since the death of his parents he hasn't worked with anyone else. Their death hit him hard as he blames himself. He should have been there. His loyalty to the paying client is never in question. As long as they pay he will work. Credits are credits.
**Appearance:**
Wes is almost always in his armor. The black, gray and red tones are colors of the Del-Fin clan, which he wears proudly. At almost 6'4" in his armor he poses an intimidating figure. The blaster carbine, which is always in hand, further impresses the picture of the Mandalorian warrior. Under the armor one would find a man a few inches shorter then the armored one. Short brown hair and matching brown eyes that are difficult to read. His skin tone is relatively light due to wearing the armor most of the time.

**Servo's Story**
Born among the scrap of Raxus Prime, **Servo** roams the junk planet as a guide to the few interested travelers willing to hire him. He has circumvented the planet several times on foot - made slightly easier by some custom upgrades to his leg servos. Living the solitary life fits him well, and there are very few people that register as "friend" in his neural memory banks. One is **Rex** - the droid responsible for assembling Servo from scrapped parts, and another is **Cog** - a freelancing astromech mechanic that hangs out at *The Rusty Bucket*, one of the few spaceport cantinas of Raxus Prime.
Only a couple weeks ago Servo was able to obtain complete schematics for a *SoroSuub X-34 Landspeeder*, an slightly outdated mode of somewhat reliable transportation that would make scavenging between clients much easier, not to mention ferrying said clients across occasionally hazardous scrap fields. Most of the necessary parts should be easy to find for someone who knows where to look, and he certainly does. But the smaller, more intricate pieces could take time. And Servo has plenty of that - what else is there for a droid to do, after all? He makes sure to check in with Cog once or twice a month to see if there are any special parts available, or job leads. There usually aren't.
**Servo's Current Activity**
At the moment, Servo is searching the insides of a rather large and damaged cruiser of unrecognizable design for anything that might help with his Landspeeder project, or anything that he might be able to barter to Cog back at The Rusty Bucket. He's about three days due North of the nearest Spaceport.
**History**
*Once upon a time there was a protocol droid, designation **Y-3PO**, who served his master well on the planet Coruscant. So well, in fact, that when asked by Imperial authorities to replay every conversation his master had ever had with his friends from Nar Shaddaa he was able to do so verbatim, and in their exact vocal patterns even. In a mystery never fully solved, it was only days later that his master went missing. No one seemed to know what happened, not even the DRK-1 droid that Y-3PO had seen on the grounds lately. Shortly thereafter he was brought to a very exclusive droid club, for upgrades as a free gift from the Empire.*
---
In the growing light of a new day on *Raxus Prime*, a droid known as **Rex** watches several tons of debris fall to the planet's surface yet again. This planet...*his* planet. How long had he called it home? Since... ****... a long time. Endlessly scouring the scrap fields for anything useful before the larger, more organized treasure hunters arrived, Rex would often find bits and pieces of nearly operable tools or service droids. Rarely anything larger than an Astromech or Pit Droid chassis that had any promise for a local cantina or garage though. Today, however, he found a friend.
Well, most of a friend anyway. It took Rex quite sometime to repair the exterior chassis, and the insides needed nearly all new parts, but the processor seemed intact. Wiped clean, but in good condition. He'd been saving some extra special parts anyway, so the work was to be expected. Only a few months later and it was time to find out who this new companion was. Rex flipped the switched and... nothing. Perhaps something needed tightening... **<…SERVOS ONLINE. SENSORS ONLINE. VOCALS ONLINE. DIAGNOSTICS INITIATED…>** "*Ah,*" thought Rex, "*So his name is Servo.*"
---
"Listen closely, *rust-for-brains*. There's no way I can let you out of here until you tell me *exactly* where you found this datapad, got it?"
The man seemed upset. Servo seemed to upset people a lot. They didn't understand that he was so new at this job.
"My good sir, we wouldn't dream of it. If you would just follow us…?"
Diplomacy was something Servo was very good at.
"Just you and me, no one else tinman."
What was he talking about? A change in tactics then. Gesturing to himself, he replied slowly, "We would love to escort you to the location where we found that datapad. Do you accept?"
The man sneered, leveled his blaster at Servo, and motioned for the hatch. "Okay. How ever many of you there are inside that glitchy junk robot brain, we're *all* going to go together. You first."
Servo exited the cantina, reasoning he and the gentleman would settle on a fee later. Sometime after they arrived at the durasteel box in the center of the discarded HX2 antipersonnel mines perhaps. Maybe he should've suggest the man bring magnetic boots to better navigate the junk field, but that might upset him. He didn't want that. That would be bad diplomacy, and Servo was a good diplomat.

</details>

Servo is currently serving aboard the *Rusty Blade* and has recently been heavily augmented from his original design resulting in radical differences in appearance, capabilities and personality.

**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

For millenia, the off-shoots of the Arkanians have been oppressed and abused by their creators. Though there are sympathizers in the populace of Arkania, it's never amounted to enough to overturn popular opinion of the half-breeds. Even on a genetic level it seemed the Arkanians were programmed to suppress their creation.
Jaya Treiden, born to a pure-blood mother and off-shoot father, shares no genetic traits with her father. In all appearances she is a pure Arkanian. Though, going through school, it showed that she possessed a drive unlike others her age. Possibly, the drive to succeed programmed into the off-shoots. Because of her lineage, Jaya's life was void of friendship, outside her parents. This left her plenty of time to study, and create friends using her imagination.
In the years the followed Off-shoot anger for their masters continually grew, climaxing in a revolution that engulfed the planet. Fearing for their safety, Jaya's parents booked passage off-world. However, only Jaya made it on-board as her parents were consumed by the mob scene at the starport.
Without guidance and support Jaya traveled around the galaxy, often as a stow-away, learning to steal what she needed to survive. One ship she stowed upon had been doing recon work for a group of pirates known as the Wyverns. Brought back to their base, she was left with no other option than to convince them of her use and hope for mercy. The pirate leader, a Chiss, saw potential in her as she was both useful as a mechanic, and also a plant on whatever target they decide to hit, using her to disable the target from the inside.
For nearly five years she plundered with the pirates, roaming wild space, and striking targets in the outer rim as war still consumed the galaxy. Her departure from the group happened abruptly when the ship she stowed upon, managed to escape to hyperspace before being boarded. She fears return to the pirates will be met with punishment as she would likely be blamed for the ship's escape.
Again, without family or friends, Jaya makes her way through the universe, using what talents she possesses to survive.

</details>

**Description**
Jaya Treiden is a 17 year old Arkanian female. Her white hair is braided tightly into a long tail down her back falling nearly to her knees. Though her clothes are rather common, her appearance gives her an air of a dilettante roaming the galaxy. She can be verbally rough and abrupt to strangers if she doesn't watch herself, sadly the downside of living with pirates.

Growing up on the jungle world of Cerea near the capital city of Tecave, Vree-Toth was in constant struggle. Once, long ago, his family was one of the most powerful families on all Cerea. Some off-shoot relatives of his even sat on the Council of Elders. The most famous, Ki-Adi-Mundi, was the great Jedi Master. Then the revolution came when so many young rebelled. With rebellion came the CIS, then Order 66, and the devastating loss of Ki-Adi. The family inevitably reverted to its Cerean roots, shunning technology and the outside world.
For years, the family lived and thrived, visiting the nearby Citadel and interacted with its alien inhabitants, while still being a part of and Tecave and its noble stature. As the years progressed word came of an Emperor, and the loss of the Jedi. With saddened heart, the Mundi family continued on as before. As more years passed the Emperor was gone, and a new government was establish. Again, this did nothing to effect the walls of solitude that the Mundi family, and Cereans in general, has fostered.
Like the journey of a glacier down a mountain, so the generations of the Mundi Family came and went until a new Emperor arose, and the inevitable rise of the SIth. Jedi, outcast from their homes, and hunted through the galaxy, began to return once again to the closed world of Cerea. These random Jedi that came to Cerea to escape both Imperial and Sith alike have found a temporary and very fragile safe house with the Mundi family. On one of these visits, it was discovered that Vree was a force sensitive. Over the next few years, visiting Jedi would instruct Vree until he was formally adopted as a Padawan.
Quick to learn, he excelled at his studies of the Force. With no one to continually train with, and the need for secrecy, he sadly has never grown proficient with his lightsaber. Vree is constantly in a state of conflict – does he give in to his Cerean sensibilities and turn his back on the Jedi, or does he truly unlearn what he has learned and fully embrace his Jedi abilities and fulfill his destiny?

**DESCRIPTION**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Standing at 2 m Vree is typical Cerean. Tall, with his elongated cranium and awkward gait, he is a serious male. Vree excels at all types of learning, but has difficulty putting his studies to practical use. He is a slow- methodical thinker that is in need of more real world experiences. These real world tests will be the catalyst to determine whether Vree fulfills his destiny and becomes a Jedi, or simply reverts to his nature and status as a noble on the introverted world of Cerea.

**Background**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jaadyr originally hailed from Kashyyyk, although that was many years ago and his history has been lost to him. With a drink problem and a penchant for battle, he's usually found frequenting one cantina or another, whether than be in a slave camp or, in the few times he's been out of captivity, a hutt-run establishment . Anyway let's start with how he got to where he is today. Jaadyr [pron. Jar-DEER (hard J, not a Y)] was taken from Kashyyyk at a young age and spent the entirety of his childhood and majority of his adult years in slavery. It didn't pay well and the young wookie harboured a lot of resentment towards his captors and on a few notable occassions managed to exact his revenge upon them. Often tasked with manual labour - space craft/station building or something equally menial - the wookie didn't really get much of an education in any form, apart from "hit this vibrohammer against this piece of durasteel or get a blast from a shock rod." However all this work made him a the physical epitome of his race and, coupled with his Albino fur, made him stand out as a figure head amoungst his people. Being white furred often made him a target from both his captors and his fellow clansmen alike. However when his snow white fur was coated in the brilliant crimson hue of fresh blood, he was truly a fearsome sight to behold. A sight that came a lot more often than not. Many people are patient, there's at least some tolerance before they crask and lash out, normally a fair amount at that too, it's not quite the case with this wookie. One wrong word, or catch him in a bad mood and you'll find your skull crushed between his hands. "Actions speak louder than words" is a particularly apt phrase from Jaadyr. Rarely speaking, except on the battlefield where it's a primal roar, you only need look into his bright red eyes to detect his intent. Enough of the sidetrack, back to the story.
So, he had been "working" in the mines on an unknown planet for at least two standard decades and had seen countless masters and slaves come, go or be disposed of, but it wasn't until a particularly spritely Bothan made his acquaintance that things changed. In a near death experience, the Bothan had bought his way out of the situation for some fresh meat, something that Jaadyr hadn't tasted in years. His name was Kath and he had been a smuggler/dealer/spice trader/jack-of-all-trades, until he was found cheating at a highstakes game of Sabaac and he found himself on the wrong side of the law when he refused to pay up. Having lost his fleet, reputation and credits, he was thrown down the pits as his final punishment where he would spend the rest of his life working to pay back his debt. The wookie wasn't the brightest laser cutter in the mine but he knew when there was a good deal to be made. After working on this exchange basis for six months, the two went into partnership and hatched a plan for escape. using the brains of the bothan and the brawn of the wookie, they felt there was nothing they could do. Word spread of their plan amongst the other slavers and they were sold out to their captors, who one night paid them a visit. Thinking on his feet, the wookie disposed of the threats before they even noticed and this triggered their escape as mass hysteria broke out throughout the camp. Leading the charge with the Kath at his side, Jaardyr smashed through countless opponents, ripping them limb from limb in a bloodfuelled rage. Hundreds of slaves followed suit and made it to the hanger bays before the camp was put into lockdown and their oppressors brought out the big guns. His coat soaked in blood, Jaadyr headed for the nearest space craft as Kath trotted along side him, the rest of the rebellion stayed back with improvised weapons to fight off the tide of destruction heading their way, sacrificing themselves for the cause. They didn't know how they managed it, but Kath, Jaadyr and a handful of others made it aboard the cramped quarters of a starship and offworld before the defense batteries could get a bead on them. Many others tried to follow suit, but they ended up being little more than a pretty aerial explosion for any onlookers on the ground.
They made it out of the system and to the midrim before they were stopped by a destroyer. Kath seeing that it was better for them to submit than become space dust submitted the craft.

Standing at 2.17m tall and weighing in at a respectable 102kg, this 199year old Albino Wookiee is truly a specimin to behold. Underneath his close cut white fur bulge muscles that are easily visible to anyone admiring his well chisled figure. Aside from a belt and the remnants of manacles around his wrists, he sports no other clothing if not wearing armour.
