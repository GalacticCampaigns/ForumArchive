# The Tale of the Beauty and the Beast (Alicia and Yogi)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-26 20:58:55)

*With the air filled with a distinctive smell and the background filled with all sorts of noise, ranging from a pair of drunken patrons hitting on a Twi'lek waitress to a loud Barabel calling the croupier a cheater, Raynar´s Cantina is not exactly the most classy place you would find in the Galaxy. Of course, if one limits the concept of the Galaxy to only include the planet Timora, it rapidly climbs in the ranks. If you limit it even further, and considers only the small settlement in which it is located, Raynar´s Cantina is the finest establishment available. Of course, the only “competition” is owned by a drug-ravaged Trandoshan and is notorious for serving just about anything as long as it can pay, so Raynar´s really win by default.
Raynar himself is the friendly barkeep, an elderly human male with a reputation for being able to obtain pretty much any kind of beverage (barring illegal ones), as long as you pay him up front. The clientèle is varied, with mercenaries on leave mixing with the local workforce, and the occasional bounty hunter or government official visiting as well. A Zeltron woman will most likely turn some eyes, but when she is accompanied by a Mandalorian warrior, the eyes will likely turn away pretty soon.
This is where our tale begins.* 
((OK, so I just put you guys there, you can figure out yourself what you are doing and how you have affected the environment and so on. There´s drinking and gambling available if you should want that, and the barkeep is always eager to chat with people, about anything between galactic politics and the local flora))

A hooded figure stepped into the cantina her armored Mandalorian companion a comfort in the establishment. Unused to trying to lay low, something the Zeltron woman had never had to attempt before, she was perhaps failing as the unusual sight of the two companions drew the attention of the cantina's patrons. She wondered how long they'd be able to stay here as it would be nice to find someplace to relax after their flight from the last planet. So far they had been able to stay one step ahead of the Sith before rumors of their whereabouts reached their ears. It was soon becoming tiresome how much they had to stay on the move.
The hood of the cloak she wore covered her pinkish white hair and the majority of her torso including her wrists was hidden by the demure folds of the cloak. However, the crimson on her skin could be distinguished as she reached out a slender, delicate hand to catch the bartender's attention. Taking a seat at the edge of the stool she adjusted the straps of the backpack holding her medical kit as she waited patiently for the proprietor to make his way to her. The unfamiliar weight of the blaster pistol Wes insisted she acquire, dug into her thigh. While he had been teaching her on how to be confident with the weapon, she still preferred if she never had to use the thing. It probably made him feel better that she had the option of defending herself if it came down to it, though the familiar weight of the hold-out in her boot probably didn't reassure him any. There was something about displaying a weapon which seemed to reassure the Mandalorian.
"**A glass of red wine please… do you have a food menu?**" The food on their latest transport hadn't exactly been appetizing, but pickers could hardly be choosers especially with her metabolism. With a glance back at Wes, the top of her hood fell back exposing her features and the crown of her head before she turned back to face the bartender, adjusting it once more.

### **Yogi** (2011-02-27 01:17:04)

**"In here."** He said pushing open the door allowing his cloaked friend to enter the establishment. **"From what I hear this is the best place for information."** Following her in he took in the establishment and the type of patrons present. **"Then again…"** He let his thought trail off without finishing taking note of those who might pose a problem. There was a good side effect of being a armored Mandalorian. People tended to want to stay out of their way.
Following Jakira to the bar he stood by as she took a seat and ordered something for herself. His head turned towards her when she asked for wine. He should have said something before entering. Asking for wine in a place like this could draw peoples attention. Wine on this planet was probably expensive. If someone was ordering it meant that they had credits. And people tended to get stupid when it came to credits even with a Mandalorian present.
He was still looking at her when she turned her head to him causing the hood to slip, revealing her pink white hair and more of her crimson skin tone. As she adjusted the hood back into place he looked back out into the cantina. Those patrons that had taken a new interest in them quickly turned back to their drinks as he looked around. ***That's right mind your own business.*** He thought to himself.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-27 05:29:15)

The bartender appears to notice Jakira right away, no doubt keeping an eye on the door at all times to observe what kind of people comes into his establishment. It takes him a few moments to make his way over to your table. He offers a warm and pleasant smile, looking over the newcomers. If he takes note of the blaster at Jakira´s side, he seems definitely more concerned with having a Mandalorian in his cantina, though in fact he seems rather untroubled by either observation.
**"Ah, I see we have a couple of new visitors. Welcome to Raynar´s good sir and miss, I trust you will find the food satisfying and the drinks likewise. Just don´t cause any trouble"**
It seems like he was casting a quick glance at Wes with that last comment, though it was hard to tell as he turned his head as something caught his eye in another end of the locale. He quickly turns back to you and places two data chips on the table.
**"For our full menu of both food and wines, place these in the slots on the table. Once you have made your selection, key in your order, and a server will bring it to you shortly. Now if you´ll excuse me, there seems to be some disturbance over at the sabacc tables"**
With another pleasant smile, he turns away and starts to head towards the gambling section of the room, calling out a series of derogatory comments about the mental capacities of reptilians, as he firmly urges the Barabel screaming at the croupier to leave.
As you look at the sides of the table, you each find a data card slot.

### **Yogi** (2011-02-27 09:16:05)

It was taking a few moments for the bartender to make his way to them at the bar. When Jakira asked for wind and a food menu they were directed over to a table near the far wall. Giving a nod to the man he motioned with his head for Jakira to follow him. The table wasn't in the best position for him to keep track of things in the in the cantina but it wasn't terrible. And since be wasn't alone, which was a change for him, it made keeping tabs on things easier.
Looking at the woman he smiled beneath his helmet. Since he had woken up on the Wheel just over two weeks ago this woman had been there for him in more ways than he could imagine. Not only had they become lovers but she was was fast becoming a most trusted friend. One that he would protect at any cost.
When the bartender appeared at their table and introduced himself Wes simply gave the man a nod when not causing trouble was mentioned. Data chips and instructions were left as Raynar left to take care of an altercation leaving them alone.
When the man was out of earshot he leaned in closer to Jakira. **"If this is the best place here the worst must really be a treat."** He quipped as he slid the data card into the slot bringing up the menu. Looking at the prices he confirmed his earlier suspicion, the wine was expensive.

## Best not to test that theory...

### **Alicia** (2011-02-27 11:30:39)

With a graceful hope off the stool she followed Wes to the table the bartender had indicated to them. Taking a seat next to Wes she began the process of removing her medical kit from her back an indication to Wes that she intended on staying awhile. She was intent on sitting down for at least one semi-decent meal. The Zeltron woman couldn't help but to grace the bartender with a dazzling smile in thanks as he left the datacards on the table.Entering the card in the slot she flipped through the menu.
A slight grimace appeared on her face at the range of choices. Even the selection of wine was bad and overly expensive. "**I'd rather not test that theory, darling,**" she said. "**I don't think my constitution would survive anything worse.**" With a sigh, she began plugging in her order, choosing a light beer instead of her original intention of wine along with what would be a multiple course meal consisting of an interesting version of a gumbo, breaded nerf steak with a couple choice sides of vegetables and pasta. "**This certainly isn't the Marquette Grand, is it?**" she asked, leaning into him.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-02-27 13:21:52)

**"No it isn't but then again I have been in worse places."**
Seeing that she was already finished ordering he looked again at the terminal and entered in his order. When satisfied he hit accept and a blackened nerf steak, a local fried potato and beer had been ordered.
**"I wonder where we should go from here?"** He said placing both armored forearms on the table. It was irritating that all the knowledge he had about the galaxy was now a hundred years out of date. Luckily Jakira was with him. If anyone had an idea of what was going on she did. At least he had some time in front of the holonews back at the Marquette Grand. That is when Jakira hadn't needed his attention.

It takes a few minutes for your food to arrive, carried out by a young, red-haired human female who bears a slightly noticeable resemblance to old Raynar. As she hands Wes his dish, and places the first of the ordered courses before Jakira, she smiles pleasantly towards the Mandalorian and gives him a barely noticeable wink with her eye. Leaving two glasses filled with the ordered beverages, she heads off to disappear through a door next to the counter.
In the background, someone turns on a holofeed reporting the latest news in the war between the rightful emperor Darth Krayt and the rebel Roan Fel. For anyone with even a slight understanding of the recent galactic history, the feed will come of as heavily biased propaganda in the favor of the Sith Empire. Shifting topics, the feed goes on to report about a fugitive Jedi evading authorities on Nar Shadaa, and another surgical strike executed by the Galactic Alliance Fleet Remnant.
Over at the game corner, the volume seems to be going up even further, as the Barabel loudly protests his banishment, and new voices joins in on both sides of the argument.

## The best kind of attention

### **Alicia** (2011-02-27 17:37:06)

A small, knowing smile crosses Jakira's face as the young daughter of the proprietor distributed their food, making flirtatious overtures to her armored companion in the process. The Zeltron doctor watches the young woman disappear behind the doors of the kitchen. With the girl gone, her attention turns back to her companion the knowing smile still gracing her features. Picking up a spoon she had a small taste of the gumbo. "**Well now… if she's as good in bed as she is a cook, she must make her lovers very happy,**" she said conversationally, looking up at Wes and giving him a wink, mimicking the young girl.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-02-27 18:11:09)

Wes watched Jakira from behind her helmet. The smile on her face could say volumes as he was sure that she saw the young girls attempt to flirt with him. Reaching up he removed his helmet and sat it on the table next to him. Looking at to where the young girl had vanished into the back room. Bringing his gaze back to Jakira the smile was still in place as she tasted her food.
At her comment about the cooking and her lovers he laughed cutting into the steak taking a good sized bite into his mouth savoring the quite tasty meat. **"You might be right. Lets just hope its not her brother who's doing the cooking back there."** He said in a matter of fact tone despite the smile he tried to hide. **"Besides with you my hands are more full."** he said returning her wink as he took another bite of his steak.

### **Alicia** (2011-02-27 18:32:37)

Taking another bite of the food she gave him another smile as he broke the seals on his helmet, taking it off. "**If it's her brother cooking, then I think I'm in love,**" she teased, ignoring his last insinuation. The last couple weeks with Wes were the longest she had ever found a lover in one man. She could hardly count Mahchen, who she had on several occasions found comfort with, but neither of them had ever held illusions it could or would ever be more than finding solace with a like spirit. Wes on the other hand at times seemed to have other ideas.
The thought of her closest friend who had sacrificed himself to protect his people saddened her for a moment before she hid it with a smile for her next remark. "**Raynar must have his hands full with a family of fine cooks.**" It wasn't long till the gumbo was gone and she tried a sip of the beer, making a face at its taste. "**This stuff is awful,**" she said in an undertone, though over the noise from the gambling table it probably didn't matter. Setting down the glass , she pushed it away from her. "**I think I'd rather drink shots of whiskey.**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-02-27 21:32:42)

Continuing to eat as she teased him Wes smiled and grabbed his glass of beer. It was pretty bitter but passable for him. Setting the glass down he playfully pointed a finger at her "Touche." he said.
Turning at the rising commotion at the gaming tables Wes missed the very brief look of saddness that had crossed her features. Had he been paying attention he would have caught it.
Behind them he could see that the Barabel's protests were becoming louder ny the second. Even though Raynar was tending to it Wes began to wonder how long it was going to continue.
Shaking his head he began turning back around only to catch the holonews and the report about the GA fleet and Fel's Empire. From the looks of it the report seemed heavily biased towards the Sith but it had got him thinking.
Leaning slightly towards Jakira his armored shoulder touched hers. "Do you think that the GA fleet and this Fel have a chance against the Sith?" He spoke only loud enough for her to hear him.

### **Alicia** (2011-02-27 23:11:53)

Jakira was relieved when she noticed that Wes had missed the moment of sadness. Having promised herself she wouldn't dwell on what she had lost, it seemed more important that when she did inexplicably have her moments of grief Wes not see them. He believed her to be strong, and only by pushing forward would she be able to be that. Her focused remained on the empty bowl through the split moments, Wes's attention diverted to the bar around him, but when he leaned into her she looked up, giving him a small smile.
At his question Jakira's attention turns to the HoloNews for a moment. Turning back, there was a frown on her features as she thought the question over. "**Fel has been slowly amassing support over the last decade, ever since he managed to escape Kryat and the Moff council's coup. Suffice to say he's recently become a thorn in the Empire's side.**" Pausing she took another look back. "**The real question, is what can't the Remnant and Fel's fleet do if they join forces.**" Leaning into him she continued whispering to him. "**But considering it was under Fel's rule the Alliance and the Jedi were eliminated, their desired goal to get rid of Krayt and the Sith Empire will have to be enough to get over that obstacle.**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-02-28 00:54:37)

He almost snorted at her synopsis of the two fractions that opposed Krayt.
**"Well what the hell are they waiting for?"** He said softly as his mind ran though tactics that were a century old but one thing held true still. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. **"Separately it sounds like neither the GA or Fel can mount any major crippling actions against the Sith. And if they tried they would be putting their necks out too far to make the odds worth it."** He grabbed his glass and finished the bitter beer setting the glass down away from him. **"If I were the Sith I'd be doing all I could to prevent that from happening."**
He began to pick over the fried potatoes he had ordered. He wasn't sure what the seasoning was that they used but they were quite good. When full he pushed the plate away a few inches and looked at Jakira and sighed. At her questioning look he gave her a half smile and explained still keeping his voice low. **We're doing the same as they are."** He indicated the holovid that was showing another news segment on the GA Remnant. **"We're on the move but we really have no one to back us up if needed. Tactically that's not sound and sooner or later it will bite us."**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-02-28 11:52:42)

The Zeltron watches him mull over their tactical situation, picking over the potatoes till he was full. Her eyebrow raises in question as he sighs and waits to see if he will share with her his thoughts. "**What do you have in mind? Join with the Remnant? Roan Fel?**" she paused considering her own question. "**In the end, we'd probably just be aligning ourselves with a power which will only be veering for dominance in the galaxy. Even if they do ally themselves, it may only be for long enough to dislodge Krayt's Sith Empire from power before they start kicking their heels at each other.**"
Jakira had been young, in her late teens when the war between the Galactic Alliance and the true Empire began their war over the failure of the Ossus Project. While she knew history was always written by the victors, the victors in the conflict being Krayt and his Sith Order, the events were still fresh in the minds of those who lived during those times. Even then, hearsay and prejudices were hard to filter through. Who knew what exactly happened? Maybe they could work together and resolve their differences in face of a common enemy? With the thoughts she gave a small shrug, "**Though… joining either would give us the backup and the chance to help prevent another Solsis. Besides.. Fel has his Imperial Knights and the Remnant must still be in touch with the last of the Jedi… maybe they would teach us.**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-02-28 14:24:37)

Wes simply nodded as she talked.  He like the way she was thinking.  It showed that he was rubbing off on her a bit looking at the options a bit like him but with her point of view.  
**"I know but those two have to be better than a Sith regime running wild ruling with an iron fist. I know neither is perfect and even when it was the GA things weren't perfect."**
He liked the idea of meeting up with either the Remnant or Fel's people. To be honest the two Imperial Knights he had known had left a little to be desired. They were practically fanatical in their views. Nothing was ever that black and white.
If he had his choice he would go with the Remnant and the Jedi. Granted the few he had known a century ago were probably now dead. Question was how many of today's Jedi still lived?
Mulling something over he looked at her. "You're right joining up with one would benefit us considerably. The question is which one? Fel's knights seem very fanatical with their beliefs and support of their Emperor."
The use of the title Emperor didn't sit well with him. While he hadn't been born when the Empires first Emperor ruled the galaxy the effects of his rule had lasted for decades.
**"I don't know about you but to me the Remnant and the Jedi sound like the better option at the moment. That and they can probably use all the experienced fighters and doctors that can get their hands on."**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-28 16:41:09)

As they leaned together and talked about the future, a shadow set over Wes and Jakira. Not really what to expect inside a full cantina, they turned their heads in tandem, and had to shift their gazes upwards to lay eyes upon the duo that had appeared behind them.
On he right towered a massive, muscular creature with distinct feline traits, easily recognizable as a Togorian, a species ill-reputed as pirates and mercenaries, and generally known for their aggressiveness and physical and martial prowess. This particular one stood well over two meters tall, muscles rippling under a white-gray fur with dark stripes, and blue eyes scanning the couple absently. He was wearing a simple, beige jacket reaching to the waist, and a set of pants ripped at the knees on multiple spaces. Underneath the jacket, a less than recently washed tank top could be spotted. He appeared to carry no weapons, though knowing the reputation of the Togorians, he was probably capable of causing all sorts of trouble with nothing but his fists.
Next to him was a shorter - but still enough to reach his shoulder - creature of a seemingly reptilian species. Noting the distinctive fangs in the corners of his mouth, and the black, hairless skin, Jakira recognizes him as a Dashade. A species known to be just as vicious as the Togorians, if not more, believing in a strict "might makes right" philosophy. Rather secretive, Dashade has become a more common sight in the later years, given their skills as mercenaries, and at hunting Jedi in particular, thanks to their resilience to the Force. He is wearing a black trenchcoat-style garb, with equally dark pants underneath but lacking a top. Like his feline partner, he appears unarmed but formidable, and his face widens into a grin as Wes and Jakira turns around. He places a massive hand on Jakira´s shoulder and leans down a bit, locking his orange eyes with hers.
**"Hello sweetie. You wouldn´t have spent some time on Solsis VII lately, would you?"**
Given your recent experience with the local beer, you can estimate he has taken in some of it recently by the smell of his breath.

---

### **Alicia** (2011-02-28 16:58:42)

Jakira looks up at the duo, not liking the looks of the pair one bit. Displaying what she hoped was a rather confused expression as she piped, "**Where?**" Glancing at Wes her eyebrows rising in question. "**Is it some sort of hotel?**" With an attempt to shrug off the orange eyed Dashade's hand off her shoulder, she picks up the beer she had earlier discarded, taking a small sip of the vile substance. "**I'm afraid if you're looking to go there for your next vacation I don't know anything about it, but I do know the perfect place!**" she said with a small smile as she looked back up at the Dashade. "**There's this quaint little planet not to far from the border of the Denabus system. Mmmmhuhmm, the sunrises are to die for!**"
**Deception** +10

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-28 17:36:25)

The large reptilian turns his head to the Togorian, and when the feline responds with a smile, he breaks out in a roaring laughter. As he turns back to Jakira however, his eyes looks a bit more intense, and she can feel his grip on her shoulder tighten a bit, locking her firmly in place, should she try to move it.
**"Now now, sweetie, how about we agree not to lie to each other? You see, we happen to *know* you have been there recently, and were just asking to be polite. In fact, our boss is quite interested in the work you were doing there, and he has asked us to bring you in to see him. And I think we can all agree that it would be better if you came without a fuss, am I right?"**
His grin returns with the last comment, but his grip on Jakira´s shoulder remains as firm as before, and she gets a feeling that he means what he says.
((Smile, and feel intimidated <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> ))

### **Alicia** (2011-02-28 18:04:11)

The young Zeltron jumps slightly at the sound of the Togorian's laughter toppling the pint of beer to puddle and drip from the table. The sound draws attention to them from the other patrons of the cantina before they looked away once more. Only slightly intimated she looks between the two go-to men. "**Does your boss have a name? I happen to have a very strict code about meeting those I don't even know the names of.**" Picking up her napkin she vainly attempts to mop up the beer before it spread to her lap, completely aware of the tightening hand restricting her movements. "**And what work exactly would your… employer be interested in?**" she asked, drawing out the word employer as her eyebrows rrise again as she looked back at the domineering pair. If they set out to frighten her, the were only partly succeeding. She did after all have a Mandalorian on her side, who often could be more frightening when he was provoked.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-02-28 20:51:21)

Wes sat there as the two thugs, two very large thugs, and Jakira traded words back and forth. Her attempt to deceive them wasn't going well. Either they were just too stupid or they already knew the answer to their question. As the reptile answered his question He began to go over the pair. Taking in their clothes and the way they held themselves. They way someone carries them self can tell a lot about them. Training, weapons that may be hidden and if they are overly confident. It looked like that may have all three.
Shifting his eyes when her drink spilled he looked at his friend. The hand hand on her shoulder tightened its grip a bit and he watched for any sign that she wanted him to step in. At that moment he knew reptile would be the first to die if this got messy. Yet despite the attempt to put the fear of death in her she was keeping her cool. She simply looked back at them asking who their employer was. ***That's right stay cool keep them talking.*** He thought to himself.
Shifting slightly, as if to make himself more comfortable due to his armor, he continued to look at the two and Jakira. Both hands stayed where they were visible on the table. The left was close to his helmet which was always close by. The other tapped a finger upon the tables surface a mere foot from the grip of his carbine.
Now he waited for their answer.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-28 21:08:08)

**"And here I was, thinking doctors were smart. It doesn´t work that way"**
The Dashade straightened up a bit, but his hand remained on Jakiras shoulder. The Togorian smiled as Wes eyes glanced across him, and he pushed the Dashade in the side and pointed at the sitting warrior. The reptilian once again gave away a roaring laugh, though shorter this time, and used his free hand to spread his coat wide, revealing nothing more than his bare upper body underneath.
**"Like what you see, boy? We´d heard a Mandalorian was travelling with you, my dear, but I have to say I expected a little…more"**
Taking a step to the right, the massive creature placed his remaining hand on Jakiras left shoulder and gently but firmly pushed her towards the edge of her seat.
**"Now come on, we don´t have all day"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-02-28 22:08:34)

Jakira gave a small wince of pain from her own resistance as the Dashade pushed on her shoulders in his attempt to gently push her out of her seat. A part of her was curious as to why these two had been sent to collect her, but recent events made her wary. Who ever wanted her had probably hoped the sight of the intimidating thugs would make her more cooperative. She had to admit, had she been alone it would have worked rather well. Suffice to say she didn't see much choice but the go with them. While she had high confidence in her companion's abilities, they were both at a disadvantage cornered as they were.
With a glance at Wes, she gave a nod to no one really in particular. "**Very well,**" she said, and slowly attempted to stand up from her chair.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-01 00:47:05)

Wes simply eyed the Dashade, saying nothing, as the reptile pulled back his coat revealing no weapons other than the massive muscles he possessed. He was no slouch being stronger than most but he held no illusions that both of the thugs were physically stronger than he was. No other acknowledgment was given other than a slight nod of his head at the attempted bullying. It would have been foolish to try anything now as they were both sitting and the two basically had them backed up against the wall.
When the second hand was placed on her other shoulder to move her along he caught her nod as she slowly began to stand. Copying her movement she stood slowly grabbing his helmet with one hand. The other hung at his side close to his carbine but he made no movement to grab it. Standing just about equal with the Dashade Wes looked into the aliens yellow eyes. Showing him that their attempts to maybe strike fear in him proved to be fruitless. **"Where she goes I go."** The tone in his voice and the look in his eyes left no mistake as to his intentions. If they attempted to take her without him, the poodoo was about to hit the fan.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-01 12:33:50)

The Dashade appeared to be no more impressed with Wes than the other way around, but just casually shrugged as he let one hand go of Jakira and indicated the door and started to walk away, Wes following. The Togorian threw something on the table behind them, and then took up the rear, walking just behind Wes, and making sure that the Mandalorian remained in his shadow. A few eyes were turned towards the group as they left the cantina, but paid them little heed after they had taken in the initial sight of the tall feline, the shady-dressed reptilian, and the armored Mandalorian. In fact, while she might have normally been the one drawing an eye or two, few people even seemed to notice Jakira.
Led by their newfound "acquaintances", they headed out on the streets, and down a route both Wes and Jakira knew to lead to a spaceport. As they walked, Wes felt his shoulder nudged a bit, and as he turned, the Togorian gave a small nod and pointed toward his carbine. Noticing the gesture, the Dashadeturned around and looked at both Wes and Jakira.
**"Ah, that´s right. If you would be kind enough to hand over any weapons you might be carrying, it would be appreciated. Just as a precaution"**
His mouth spread into a wide grin again, revealing the two enlarged fangs in its corners, and he reached out a hand towards Jakira while you walk, indicating he wants the blaster at her side.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-01 13:10:57)

Not getting any resistance from the pair Wes fell in behind Jakira bringing up his helmet and reattached it to his armor before exiting the cantina. Once outside they were led towards the same spaceport they had just come from only hours ago. Wondering just where they were going he made sure to keep track of landmarks.
It wasn't long before he felt a push on his shoulder. Turning to look at the Togorian the large feline was gesturing at his carbine. Knowing that this was coming he hesitated for a couple seconds before grabbing the weapon by the body with his right hand as his left undid the clip that held it to the sling. Slowly he handed the well used but well maintained weapon over. Turning around the other was asking Jakira for her weapon. Placing an armored hand on her shoulder he nodded. **"Go ahead."** As he spoke her sent her a reassuring nudge through the Force.
Looking at the Dashade he indicated their direction of travel. **"How much farther?"** He was getting tired of being led around.

---

Relief spread through Jakira as the Drashade removed his hands from her shoulders. With nothing left but to stand and follow along peaceably, she found herself even more relieved when Wes wasn't prevented from coming along. Picking up her medical kit from where she had dropped it beside her chair, she followed behind the reptilian, Wes in her shadow. When she realized they were on the same path as the spaceport she began to wonder how far this.. interested party had come to collect her.
She was hardly surprised when it was "requested" they hand over their weapons. As Wes's hand came up to her shoulder, the nudge of reassurance only slightly overcoming the slight bit of trepidation she felt, she gave him a slight nod. Moving the folds of her cloak aside fully revealing the brand new side arm blaster, she followed Wes's lead in removing the power pack from the blaster before handing it over. Since the Drashade has made no reference to the hold-out she kept in her boot, she didn't bother making any attempt to hand it over.
Deciding silence was the best course, she held her tongue as they duo led them on, taking in the sights and anything else which may be beneficial to them if they had to make a quick getaway. After all, her initial attempts to talk herself out of the predicament had failed, all there was left to do was to see it through.

After a few minutes of walking in uncomfortable silence, you arrive at and enter the spaceport complex, and the Dashade leads the group on a straight trail towards one in the line of many docking bays, and takes you inside. As the lights come alive in the small bay, you notice a few maintenance droids scurrying away from the ship, seemingly having been in the process of fueling it. The Dashade casts a glance after the droids as they pass him, but pays them no heed as he walks up to the ship.
The ship is of an older model, not one that Jakira or Wes can identify right away, but it seems like it has been kept in pretty good shape. The ship is shaped in a C pattern, with one side being about twice as thick as the other, obviously holding cockpit, crew quarters and cargo holds. On the end of the other side is mounted a small dual laser turret along with what could possibly be fuel tanks or some sort of exhaust vent.
The Dashade presses a few buttons to lower the ships ramp, and waves for the rest of you to come inside. Once inside, you enters through the cargo hold, and is shown into what seems to serve as a common area. The ship is apparently not meant for large crowds, and the common area features a couch, a table with a built-in hologame system, as well as a few makeshift seats consisting of crates. The Dashade passes straight through and into the cockpit, and you can soon feel the ship taking off.
The Togorian pushes one of the crates up against the wall and settles down upon it. Weighing Wes´s carbine and Jakiras pistol in his hands, he gestures for you to sit down. Then his face widens into a smile and he hurls the two weapons into the couch and laughs heartly.
**"You can relax now. I told him we should stop once we got you on board, and he´s going to be busy piloting anyway. Name´s Muurak by the way, and my grumpy friend is Tek. I hope we didn´t scare you too much"**

### **Alicia** (2011-03-01 17:32:43)

Her suspicion that they would be taking her off planet soon proved true as the duo ushered them onto the awaiting freighter. Not knowing much about ships, she could only remark that the owners seemed to take care in its maintenance. The fact it was refueled and waiting told her it wouldn't be much longer till it took off all together. Passing through the cargo, shadowed by the Togorian, Jakira's curiosity in the whole adventure disappears.
With a glance around, Jakira takes in the sight of the common room, used probably only by these two up till now. It certainly wasn't meant to host passengers, but a small crew. Bracing herself against the nearest bulkhead the Zeltron refused the offered seat, her usually sweet face darkening as anger began to grow in her. "**Well,… Muurak,**" the Zeltron started, her arms crossing over her chest. "**I don't appreciate being abducted.**" With every word her ire seemed to grow as she regarded the smug Togorian. "**And now that you have us here, you better start explaining.**"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-01 18:19:11)

Spreading his hands out in defense, Muurak gestured towards the cockpit.
**"Hey hey, that whole thing was Tek´s idea. He´s got kind of a twisted sense of humor…"**
Echoing the Togorians comment, another roaring salvo of laughter came from the cockpit, and the feline smiled as if his point had just been made. Turning back to Jakira, he remarked in a slightly lowered tone.
**"He really is a nice guy though, just don´t say it to his face"**
Dropping the smile and adopting a slightly more serious facial expression, he continued.
**"But you are right, of course. We do owe you an explanation.
Tek and I serve as lieutenants in a mercenary group known as the Crimson Raiders. Have you heard of us? No? Well, no surprise there, we are a small band that operates mainly on the Outer Rim. Most recently we´ve been deplying on the planet Vrexa IV. They have had a…shall we say "enforced change of government" recently, and as you might guess that didn´t sit well with everybody. In fact, a small resistance movement has been formed, and it is they who have been hiring us"**
Taking a moment to scratch the fur on his cheek, Muurak looked at Wes and Jakira.
**"Any questions so far?"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-01 19:25:14)

The feeling that they had made a mistake was beginning to fade. Despite the fact that they both looked threatening he didn't get the gut feeling that they were about to be attack.
When he ship cycled up and began to lift off the feeling in his gut was beginning to solidify as he turned his armored head towards her. When the large toothy smile erupted from the Torgoran followed by their weapons being tossed to the couch Wes looked back at Jakira. At this point he didn't need the Force to read her feelings. It was written plain as day across her face. Taking a more relaxed posture he once again removed his helmet as he regarded the feline.
At his companions stern tone asking for an explanation Wes walked closer to the couch as Muurak began his explanation that was in time with the howls from Tek in the cockpit. The explination was that they were mercies working out of Vrexa IV and hired by the resistance there.
Realizing that there was no threat he retrieved their weapons and looked at Muurak. **"Ok that explains who you are for the most part but forgive us if we don't believe it till it's backed up."**  Taking several steps he reversed his grip on the blaster and handed it back to Jakira grip first.
**"But the question still remains, why her? And how did you know she was on Solsis VII."** He made sure to leave out anything that happened there and his involvement there.
He remained close to Jakira waiting for an answer. The whole time reaching out to her through the Force reasurring her. While they weren't out of the forest yet it was looking better as now the two were split up.

### **Alicia** (2011-03-01 20:09:37)

The hiss of Wes's helmet coming off caused her to turn. Knowing he wouldn't have taken it off unless he felt confident about the situation a part of her relaxed.For a moment she looked at the pistol he was handing to her, before finally she uncrossed her arms and took it from him. The weapon felt unusually heavy in her hand as she moved the folds of her cloak to put it away. Her anger ebbing away, she took the few steps toward the couch sitting on the edge. She could sympathize with the people of Vrexa IV. After all it hadn't been so long ago the Sith Empire had come to Solsis VII and began exploiting the Hobben people, forcing their own leadership and Force users into hiding within the catacombs of her very own hospital.
Still if they were looking for her help, they hadn't gone about it in such a way for her to be agreeable about it. "**Better yet: how did you know I wasn't on Solsis and where to find me?**" Jakira added.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-01 20:29:22)

The Togorian watches Wes pick up their weapons, and shows no intention of being uncomfortable with it. Feeling a somewhat warmer attitude from the Mandalorian, he fires of another smile at Jakira as she asks her questions.
**"Excellent question, I was just getting to that. You see, one of our men visited Solsis VII every now and then, an Ithorian named Yutta. He was our resident BC expert, and spent some time around the various medical facilities of the planet. Which would have included the clinic that you helped start, young lady. Perhaps you recognize the name? Well, it really doesn´t matter since he´s dead"**
While the Togorian might have been taking a dramatic pause, the booming voice of Tek sounds from the cockpit.
**"You mean liquidated!"**
Shaking his head, Muurak looks back at the couple with an apologetic look on his face.
**"Any way…despite my friends poor attempt at humor, the term is rather striking, in more than one sense. You see, the new regime on Vrexa didn´t really see eye to eye with this whole rebellion thing, and when the locals hired mercs to aid them, things got real bad. The government has the capital pretty well locked down, though we control most of the smaller settlements. Recently though, things took a turn for the worse, as the regime turned to somewhat…shady means to dispose of us.
Remember what I said about Yutta? Well apparently someone in the government has some brains and realized that if you want to pull off a BC attack, you take out the doctor first. We found the poor bastard on the floor of his chamber, partly turned into some sort of organic goo. Shortly after, serious outbreaks started to rampage our settlements, not just confining itself to the military installations. To be blunt with you, we´re kind of stumped at the moment, until someone recalled Yutta had mentioned a rather talented Zeltron medic he had heard of.
As for how we tracked you down, that was rather simple. We reached out to Yuttas local contacts on Solsis VII and were told you had left. The Raiders in general and Tek in particular has quite extensive contacts both here and there. And frankly, it didn´t seem like you were trying to hide your tracks at all"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-01 23:24:12)

Jakira realized the Togorian was right. They hadn't been making a considerable effort to hide their travels, it probably would've only been a matter of time before someone they didn't want to find them did so. "**I see. I wish I could help you Muurak, but I'm no expert in bio chemical warfare nor am I a bio chemist. I could attempt to mitigate this plague that's inflicted the settlements but if it's not a disease I'm already familiar with there's nothing I can do, but delay the inevitable.**"
Crossing her arms again, she glared at the Togorian. "**Frankly I don't appreciate you dragging me into this. Especially since you just admitted the government is actively seeking to kill any doctors from helping your little… rebellion.**" Her tone grew stern again as her eyes narrowed at their "host". "**What makes you think I would even want to help you?**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-02 03:44:53)

Listenig to their story Wes sat down on the couch with Jakira. The tale was a gruesome one yet despite that he still wasn't sure what they wanted with her. From what he knew her speciality didn't lie along those lines. That and the fact that the government were activly trying to eliminate their doctors put them, her most of all in danger. He turned his head slightly to regard her.
Almost as if she had been reading his mind she stated as much. Something still wasn't right. They were getting the story but was it the whole story? Before adding anything he waited for Muurak to answer her questions. In deed the two bruisers had taken quite a leap of faith in the assumption that they would help especially after being, for the lack of a better word, kiddnaped. As angering this woman, who sat next to him, was generally a bad idea.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-03 11:40:07)

Looking as if he might have expected such a reaction, the Togorian sighed, and then chuckled lightly.
**"To be honest, I don´t really know. And, for the record, it wasn´t my idea to start with, I´m just following orders. If you want a more thorough explanation, you´re going to have to ask General Wann. Perhaps Yutta had been telling him something he had observed about you that I don´t know of. Or perhaps it was because he have failed in reaching out to any other medical contacts the Raiders possess"**
Spreading his hands wide in a gesture that seemed to say that he really had no idea, Muurak continued.
**"What I can tell you though, is that you would be quite well-paid for this job. Plus, I happened to overhear your last piece of conversation in the cantina. If you were thinking of seeking out Admiral Stazi and his fleet, the Raiders can help you with that. Like I said, we have some connections here in the Rim, and have even been hired to perform a few tasks for the Remnant on occasion"**
Feeling the ship shudder a bit, he pointed towards the cockpit.
**"And you can relax, you are not "in this" just yet. Tek just sent us on a microjump into some random piece of space, where you can make your decision. If you don´t want to take the job, we´ll just drop you off someplace you´d like and be on our way. Though if you´re going to say no, please make it quick, as then I´ll have to try and find someone else who might, before the entire planet turns into liquid goo.
Oh, and did I mention it is the Sith that have taken control of the planet?"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-03 12:38:20)

Wes stayed pretty impassive as Muurak answered Jakira's question. Knot knowing much as to why her other than that he was under orders from a General Wann they were still at a loss for information.
What he did tell them caused him to look over at his companion. A chance to meet up with the Remnant and quite possibly the Jedi would be a benefit to them both. Coupled with the fact of being well compensated didn't hurt. There were still a few things that he needed for his armor and he didn't want to keep asking Jakira for the credits even though she happily gave them to him.
His current train of thought came to a halt when the Sith were mentioned causing him to once again look in her direction. ***Out of one cooking pot and into another.*** He thought sending her a nudge of reassurance though the Force. They both had now had a past with the Sith and being thrown back in probably wasn't the best idea.
Looking back to the Togorian He gave a small nod. **"You're right we will need to talk this over. Getting well paid is one thing. Staying alive to spend it is another."**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-03 21:12:14)

The Zeltron too listened to what the Togorian had to say, at first making any indication that what he said held any importance to her. She could almost feel Wes glancing at her at the revelation they could help find the Remnant as part of their compensation for assisting them. The credits, frankly, she could care less about. Being a doctor was a career to some, a way to make money, but for her it was a passion, she used her skills because she cared about people. Perhaps it was knowing that a fortune waited for her but the monetary compensation didn't entice her.
She relaxed when the Togorian said they hadn't already been committed. She never liked when her choices had been made for her, and this fact probably would have made her less eager to help them. At the mention her eyes met with her Mandalorian companion's, sharing perhaps the same thought. She could feel the waves of reassurance he was trying to project to her through the Force, but it did very little good. Having just recently escaped from a Sith controlled, she wasn't exactly thrilled to be heading back into a conflict, particularly in a prime position to get caught. Since they had gone looking for her back on Solsis, she wondered whether they had heard what had happened there. Perhaps they believed thanks to recent events she would be more sympathetic to help them; they were right.
Nodding in agreement with Wes about discussing things she stood. "**I understand your need for haste. Please give us a few minutes of privacy to discuss this.**" Moving to Wes's side, she took his arm and nudged him to start walking back the way they had come, back into the cargo hold. But her mind had already been made up because as they reached the privacy of the cargo hold she said, "**I want to do it… I don't know what help I will be, but I can't…**" she stopped, gritting her teeth a moment. "**I can't stand by while the Sith attempt another genocide.**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-03 22:15:52)

Standing when she came to his side he was led to the cargo hold where they could talk more freely. Turning to face her he saw the look on her face. It was then that he knew that she had already made up her mind on what to do. He nodded as she talked his arm still locked with hers. He could see the determination that was set in her features mostly from her eyes and the way she held her jaw.
**"I know you can't. To walk away from this would diminish was had been sacrificed for us to get away last time."** He brought his hand up and gently laid the armored hand on her upper arm. **"I think you'll be more help than you realize. As I'm sure that I'll also be able to help out in some way."** He said with the cool tone of his as he removed his hand and patted his carbine.
Looking back to the common area to where the Muurak was waiting for them he glanced back at her. **"Looks like out minds are made up. Might as well tell them. It might also be good to find out what we can about Admiral Stazi."**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-03 22:34:04)

Her set jaw broke into a smile as she considered him. She should have known he would understand considering all they had been through and shared with each other. Being forced to leave Solsis VII after all had almost placed an irreparable wedge between them. She had to admit, though, if he hadn't bodily carried her off the planet she would probably be dead. "**I'm sure if nothing else, you can insist on making sure I stay safe…**" Placing her hand over his gauntleted hand on her shoulder her grin grew wider. Removing his hand from her shoulder she stepped toward him, closing the distance. Standing on her toes, she traced a line down his jawline stopping under his chin. "**After all, we have to be alive to spend the credits…**" she started suggestively, repeating what he had said to Muurak, her eye brow raising. Then as if by an after thought she added, "**And to find Admiral Stazi.**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-03 22:48:43)

Smiling slyly he gave her a quick kiss. **"Oh yes I'll make sure you are as safe as possible with a deadly biochemical and angry Sith on the loose. Don't you worry."** He said moving back to resume the pretense of being her bodyguard. **"Besides we'll need all the credits we can get if we want to stay in a suite like the last one we were in."** He whispered as giving her a suggestive wink remembering the time well spent together.
He was glad that she was like minded on finding Admiral Stazi. Finding him would be critical in finding the Jedi and hopefully training in the Force. Raw untrained and willing to learn all they needed was a teacher. Seeing her smile at hid comment he nodded. **"All right then we agreed to help them in return for compensation and help in finding the Remnant."** As he started to follow her out he said one last thing before being in ear shot of Muurak. **"I just wonder what they know about what happened on Solsis VII?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-03 23:12:40)

Jakira's grin grew wider, giving a girlish giggle as he gave her a quick kiss before stepping back and she half wondered when they wouldn't have to keep up the pretense any longer. Spending another week locked up in a suite somewhere sounded like a promising idea, but who knew when they'd be able to again, though they could dream. "**Plagues.. fanatical governor… either are just as deadly,**" she said with a small shrug and then she grinned at him, matching the suggestive wink. "**I am going to need another vacation after this.**" With a laugh she turned, there wasn't much time to waste as with a plague every moment was precious. She stopped as he asked the question as she had been wondering the same things. "**We can tempt fate by asking. At this point if they went looking for me there it's likely they know what happened.**" Leaving up to Wes whether or not the question was brought up, she made her way back into the common area trying to find a calm as her heart beat hard in her chest.
Even though she had made the decision, it seemed to only just dawn her exactly how much danger she was putting herself in. It wouldn't due to be afraid now, there was too much work to be done. Stepping into the common area she took a few steps toward the waiting Togorian. "**The decision has been made…**" she started, looking back at Wes as he stepped in behind her. Her attention turned back to Murrak as she said flatly, "**I'll take the job.**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-04 00:00:38)

Taking up place behind her he listened as she accepted the job. He wasn't sure if Tek, their pilot, was able to hear but he was sure that it wouldn't be long before a new course was inputted into the nav system and they would be on their way to the new employer amid planet in turmoil.
Wes stepped up beside her as he looked at Muurak. His eyes taking in the big Togarian **"So what kind of numbers are we talking about on both sides and are there any of the Sith Force users present on the planet?** He looked at Jakira quickly and then back. **"The more we know the better we can help out as soon as we get there?"** He asked already thinking of ways to help the rebels. Remembering they had just met he was already moving before the feline answered. Extending his armored hand he offered it to Muurak. **"Wes Del-Fin."** He said and then nodded his head towards Jakira. **"Dr. Jakira Boton, which you probably already knew. Probably best to get that out of the way before we start talking business."** He added as an afterthought as a friendly smile worked it's way to his face.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-04 16:23:45)

As Jakira and Wes steps back into the common area, the Togorian lifts his head from having been deep in his own thoughts, and as they declares their intent to aid, a wide smile creeps into his face. Placing two fingers between his lips, he gives off a sharp whistle, which is quickly responded from the cockpit.
**"I heard what she said, you furball, I´m less than ten meters away! Sheesh…"**
Laughing the Dashades gruff response off, Muurak turns back to Jakira and Wes.
**"I´m glad to hear it. And I´m sure the General will be pleased to hear our mission was a success"**
Standing up, he shook Wes´s outstretched hand, and even though Wes was strong, he felt that his grip compared to nothing against his newfound ally. Once again gesturing for them to sit down in the couch, he retook his seat at the crate.
**"As far as numbers go, it´s hard to say. The resistance controlled pretty much all the settlements when we left, though the regime has barricaded themselves inside the capital, and pretty much sealed the place off. They´ve pulled back all militia patrols and garrisons, which according to our intelligence means there´s about a hundred militia soldiers in there. Not to mention the Sith brought with them a battalion of stormtroopers when they descended. On our side, we have about forty or so Raiders that can really be relied on in a fight. The resistance has spirit, but if they knew how to fight on their own, they wouldn´t have called us in"**
Sighing, he shook his head.
**"That is of course if this new bioweapon hasn´t been decimating our forces even more while we were gone. Hopefully the steps we took to quarantine should have kept it from spreading, but you never know with these things. That´s why we need someone with some medical skill. Most of us know how to administer an adrenaline shot, or apply some fastflesh, but with Yutta gone that´s pretty much all we know. And anyone on Vrexa who might know something is holed up in the capital and thus currently beyond our reach.
As for the Sith, I can´t give you a good answer there, as we haven´t gotten a good look at them yet"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-04 20:05:44)

A small smile graced her face as the Togorian took Wes's hand, while their 'friendship' had gotten off on a shakey start she realized she quite liked Muurak after she got over the fact he and his friend had abducted her. Undoing the clasps on her cloak, she slid it off exposing her tight fitting shirt and the flesh it left exposed, most notably a scar from a blaster bolt going through her left shoulder. Folding the cloak, she took the proffered seat on the couch, placing it on her lap as she leaned back.
She listened as he spoke not entirely interested in the militaristic aspects of what was happening on Vrexa and then voiced her own questions as the topic turned to the plague. "**How contangious is the disease? What have you done to quarantine those infected? Have you discovered how it's transmitted; it's initial symptoms? What techniques have you tried to cure it?**" She knew she was bombarding the bruiser with questions, but the more she knew now the less she would have to play catch up when they get there.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-04 22:35:49)

**"The disease doesn´t appear to spread at an alarming rate, otherwise we´d have a full-blown pandemic on our hands by now. Considering that we´ve been away for a few days though, there´s no guarantees…"**
The Togorian looked at once concerned, but seemed to wave it away rather quick.
**"So far, we´ve had outbreaks in 5 of the 8 major settlements on the planet. In some, only a handful have been infected, but in one place several dozen have fallen ill. We´ve done what we can to create isolated environments where we keep the infected, and no one is allowed in without biohazard protection suits. We´ve also made sure to look over all supplies, discarded things we are unsure of where they´ve been handled, and increased security around the remaining. Unfortunately, we have no clue as of yet to how it actually spreads, other than that we don´t think it seems to be a good idea to touch the goo that it reduces those infected to.
One of the troubles we´ve been having with trying to get a grip of this disease, is the symptoms. We´ve had people display all sorts of common medical symptoms, like fever, chills, dehydration, nausea, headaches…you name it. Pretty much the only common factor we can see is that they seem to accumulate more and more of these symptoms, until eventually they die. We treat these symptoms like you normally would, give the dehydrated liquids to drink, tuck the chilled ones in real good…but very little of it seems to have any noticeable effect"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-04 23:48:01)

Wes remained standing but had moved closer to where Jakira had sat down. The logistics of the rebels and the regime didn't sound promising. Especially with a battalion of stormies on the ground. It was really going to be interesting to see what it was like there and to meet this general that Muurak and Tek worked for. If he was half as colorful as these two it should be quite a trip.
When the questions turned medical he paid attention. He was no doctor and knew he would be little help with the plague but this was where Jakira's talents and skills would benefit them. It didn't sound good though as it was still unknown how it spreads. **"At least I can seal up my armor. That should grant some level of protection and allow me to travel among those that are already sick."** He said looking between Muurak and Jakira. **"Looks like we're going to have our hands full."** Finally he sat down on the edge of the couch near Jakira. **"Do you have any data that she can look at before arriving. And speaking of arriving how long will it be till we get there?"**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-05 03:18:05)

**"ETA is about 13 hours, so if you want to get some sleep, you should take the opportunity. Things can get a bit hectic when we get planetside"**
All eyes shifted towards the cockpit, where Tek just exited, apparently having launched the ship into another hyperspace jump and decided the ship could handle itself from there. The Dashade hit a switch on the wall next to the cockpit, and a panel slid aside, revealing a refresher inside. He put out a finger and pointed to Muurak.
**"Wake me up when we get close, or we´ll never get past that blockade. Remember what happened last time you flew this thing?"**
Shaking his head and laughing, the massive reptilian entered the fresher and closed the door. Chuckling to himself, Muurak turned his eyes back to Wes and Jakira.
**"Well there you go, 13 hours, give or take some. If you want to take Tek´s advice though, I´d suggest you hurry. This isn´t so much a passenger liner as a recon vessel, and the one bed we´ve got is about to get filled up once he gets out of there. I´ll just be hanging out here though, so if anyone is up for some dejarik to pass the time, the table usually works"**
Looking around, the feline smiled.
**"That´s pretty much what there is to do on board. I´m afraid we don´t have any material for you to read up on Jakira, but seeing as I´ve really got nothing else to do I might as well try to answer any remaining questions you might have"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-05 23:31:04)

Jakira nodded, a bit disappointed there hadn't been anything prepared to help her catch up on the situation while they were in transit. She wasn't sure how many of her specific medical questions the bruiser would be able to answer, but she had a feeling that if the symptoms were as varied as he had stated then the solution wasn't going to come easily. For the moment, getting some rest and time to mull over events seemed to agree with her. Thirteen hours would not pass quickly awake, and there wasn't much she could do to prepare for it. Sleep, however, was going to be necessary and who knew how much of it she would get while she worked on healing the inflicted Vrexans.
"**I think I'll take your offer for the bed and then afterwards we can continue our discussion. It's unlikely once we arrive I'll be getting much sleep.**" Standing she looked down at Wes, a slight raising of her eyebrow an invitation. With a glance back at the Togorian she asked, "**If you would point me in the right direction, please?**" Stopping to pick up her pack and her folded cloak in hand, she made her way toward the lone bed and hopefully some rest.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-06 00:10:04)

At Muurak's mention of playing dejarik his eyebrow raised. It was a game he used to enjoy playing with family and friends. While no expert at it it proved to be a good way to pass time. He made a mental note to play a few games before they arrived that their destination. Glancing at Jakira as she stood mentioning sleep he caught her gaze and saw the raised eyebrow inviting him. With a slight nod he stood as Muurak pointed out the way to the sleeping quarters. Stepping beside her he dropped some of the pretenses and offered to take the pack from her.
Entering the quarters he saw that Muurak was right It was a recon ship. It wasn't much to look at as a simple bed took up most of the area in the room. Stifling a yawn he closed the sliding door behind them **"It looks like we're going to have our work cut out for us when we get there if things are really as bad as he described."** He said though the yawn as he walked farther in placing his helmet on the floor against the wall.

**"I hope you find one bed sufficient for the two of you. It´s usually me or Tek using this ride, so it´s rather well-sized. I´ll be out in the common room if you need me"**
As he left them in the quarters, Muurak banged on the fresher door, and was met with a few curses in a tongue unknown to Wes and Jakira, all thoroughly ignored.
**"Tek! Hold!"**
With a final wave of goodnight to the pair, the Togorian returned to the common area. A few moments later Tek exited the refresher and cast a look at the new passengers, but only waved them off, shook his head and moved away.
((I´ll just leave you some time to roleplay if you want to, and then I´ll move the trip forward maybe later tonight or tomorrow))

### **Alicia** (2011-03-06 16:58:37)

With a small smile at Wes as he took her medical, she followed Muurak to the small quarters. Taking a look around she waved off the Togorian's concerns regarding the bed. "**It will do. Thank you.**" She turned to watch him leave and was glad when Wes closed the doors shut behind him. Collapsing onto the bed, she began the process of taking off her boots, pulling out the hold out blaster tucked there and putting it under the pillow. While the bruisers hadn't given them a cause to distrust them since bringing them to the ship, she was perhaps keeping a bit of a grudge against them. Next to come off was the utility belt which she let fall to the ground next to the bed. "**I must admit… I'm curious as to why they think I'm qualified to help. Regardless, I agree. Things will get busy once we arrive.**" Raising an eyebrow she looked her Mandalorian companion up and down, a small smile forming. "**Would you like some help, darling?**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-06 17:24:31)

Leaning his carbine against the bed he turned around to see that she already had her boots off and was working on her utility belt. With a thud it hit the metal floor as she wondered why Muurak and Tek thought she could help them. Her next question coupled with a raised eyebrow and small smile brought on his own smile. With a shrug of his armored shoulders he looked at her. **"I don't know. Maybe they figure that a doctor, even one that is not specialized in biochemical weapons is better than no doctor. It sounds as if they are desperate. Though they have picked a good doctor, in my opinion. You've fixed me up more than once."** In response to he second question he held out his arms and looked himself over. **"While I can and have, slept in it more times than I can remember I am more comfortable with it off."** He said giving her his answer as he started with the gauntlets.

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-06 17:36:36)

Standing to approach him, she gave him a sweet smile. "**Not to mention *I'll* be more comfortable with it off too,**" she teased as she began unbuckling the plates of armor on his arms."**There's a difference between patching up wounds and curing bio-chemically induced plague. I'm an excellent surgeon and even good with the common cold, but…**" She stopped mid thought, the conversation had begun to go in circles. Tossing the plate from his arm to join his helmet she concluded, "**Well, I guess we'll see.**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-06 17:49:29)

**Yes but it would have been beneficial if they had some data for you to go over."** Together as if this had been practiced or done before the rest of his armor was quickly of and set neatly with his helmet. Underneath he still wore the form fitting under garments he normally wore with the armor. The black shirt covered him from waist to halfway down his upper arm as the same colored bottoms covered down to his ankles. Stretching slightly he reached out pulling her close. **"Thanks."** He then gave her a quick kiss and added. **"Will I now be more comfortable for you?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-06 18:03:55)

The Zeltron could only nod in agreement as her fingers worked at their task. "**It certainly would have been beneficial. Especially since during the half a day we'll be in hyperspace, I could have been reviewing patient records, analyzing commonalities. That is if there are patient records.**" She gave a shrug, if there weren't records now there certainly were going to be some once she got to work. "**There's going to be a great deal of catching up to do once I get there.**"
She was glad when the last piece of armor was pulled loose and placed, as was his usual custom, neatly in a pile. As he pulled her close, giving her a kiss, she laughed. "**Better than cold iron. There's still some layers we could do without, but it's not necessary,**" she joked, standing on her toes to deepen the quick kiss he had been giving her. With a coy smile she pulled away from, holding onto his hand she took a seat on the edge of the bed. Her expression grew serious as he joined her. "**I do fear though, that we may regret getting involved. You're right that credits or even being able to find the Remnant will do us any good if we're dead. Not to mention if there are Force users involved, who knows what they'll do once they start coming after us. Getting involved may just make things worse for the resistance.**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-06 18:26:09)

**'I know."** His smile subsided as the conversation turned more serious. **"But look at it this way. If those two…"** He jerked a thumb to the door. **"Hadn't requested our presence here,"**  He stretched out the word requested. **"We would probably still be back in the cantina trying to figure out where to go next."**  He laid back on the bed still holding her hand in his as the other ran over his short brown hair. Looking at the ceiling he continued. **"At least now we have something to put our attention towards. It's dangerous but it seems that no matter where we go in this galaxy it will be dangerous with Krayt in power. Besides it's the Remnant we'd like to find and hopefully in doing that we find the Jedi."** He was careful not to mention their own affinity to the Force. The fewer people that knew about them that the better off they were.
He let out a sigh. Finding the Jedi was big on his list. if they were to stay safe from them they both needed to learn what they could. Right now they were both untrained with raw potential just waiting for a guiding hand. One that wasn't a Sith. **"And if these Raiders and their general have the connections to make that happen, then we use them like they plan on using us and hopefully we all get what we want."** He turned his head to see her looking at him. The corners of his mouth turned up into a comforting smile.

### **Alicia** (2011-03-06 18:44:10)

While she wanted to believe Wes things would work out, she couldn't help feeling some doubt. Her life up until she had met him had been relatively predictable, though she knew very well she might still be a renegade from the Sith, dead or even a slave regardless of whether he had appeared turning her life on Solsis upside down in a mere night. There were times she still blamed him for what happened, but it hadn't been his fault he had found himself wanted by the Sith. It was becoming increasingly harder for her to hold the grudge and now it was none existent.
Not trusting the cleanliness of any of the bed clothes she unfolded her cloak, throwing it over top the two of them as she laid back on the bed with Wes. "**There's nothing like a task at hand to focus the mind,**" she said. Absently as she laid there she began drawing circles across the exposed skin of Wes's arm, starting at his wrist of the hand she held. "**Not to mention the possibility of an alliance with these Crimson Raiders. You said so yourself, we've been traveling about without an allies. They're fighting the Sith and we certainly aren't friends of theirs. Seems even if we can't find the Remnant we can still get what we want.**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-06 22:04:51)

He adjusted the cloak that she used for their blanket and settled in moving closer to her and let out a sigh. **"One way or another dear we'll get there."** He said giving her hand a squeeze. **"We still have a this plague and a battalion of storm troopers to deal with first."** His mind was already working on the problems that they may encounter. Once they arrived they would be able to get a better grasp of what they would be facing.
Turning on his side he faced her as he tucked am arm under his own head as a make shift pillow. The look on his face was a serious one. **"Be careful working with this plague Jakira. I can fight a lot of things but this is out of my realm of capability."**

### **Alicia** (2011-03-06 22:36:35)

Jakira gave her human companion a smile, particularly when he pulled her closer. Still on her back she regarded him. "**You worry about the Sith and I will the plague.**" She smiled at him, her free hand reaching across her body to stroke his jaw. "**I'm not a first year student, I know the protocol regarding quarantine. I don't plan on doing anything stupid.**" Shifting her weight she turned on her side with her back to his stomach and her arm folding underneath her head. Fears and probabilities roamed through her head and she took a deep breath in an effort to clear them. "**Good night**," she said. She fully intended in getting several hours of sleep, more if her mind allowed it and if nothing else to sit in the quiet of the room with only the sounds of the ship and her companions breathing to mark the time.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-06 23:39:27)

He gave her a nod as she reassured him that she would be careful. Twisting herself she snuggled into him and he put his arm around her like hes done many times since meeting her. Pulling her close in an effort to protect her from all the bad things in the galaxy. When in reality her closeness did just as much for him as it did for her. His own deep breath followed hers. **"Good night."** He echoed as he tried to make himself comfortable on the bed as he found himself blowing her hair out of his face like he generally did when they slept like this. Bringing his hand up he gently tucked the loose hairs away. A surprising yawn took him as his arm took up residence again around her hugging her tight.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-07 16:52:06)

While it might not be as luxurious as a hotel room, Wes and Jakira manages to rest well enough in the small quarters aboard the ship. The fact that the bed i sized after the two well-grown individuals usually riding the vessel does increase their comfort somewhat. All in all, you manage to get a good rest. A rest that ends rather abruptly as the door to the quarters opens and your gracious Togorian host enters the room, shaking you both awake.
**"Alright you two, time to get up. I´ve let you sleep for as long as possible, though I don´t think you´d want to be sleeping through what´s about to come"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-07 21:19:07)

Feeling a slight chill Wes pulled up the cloak a bit so that it covered his chest and her shoulders as much as possible. They had shifted sometime during the night and he was now on his back with Jakira now snuggled, almost coiled, around him for warmth. As he listened to her he felt the regular rhythm that each breath brought. With her head nestled on the crook of his arm he laid there not wanting to wake her. For when they arrived to wherever they were going she was going to be busy with sleep not being a readily available option. Letting out a sigh of contentment he rested his head against hers wondering if he'd be able to go back asleep. After a few moments he started to drift off again, a pleasant dream began to take hold.
Unfortunately he never received the chance to fully fall back asleep or enjoy the dream as Muurak entered the room with all the grace of a Trando. Not forgetting where he was he lifted his head to see the big Togorian walk towards the bed. Despite the fact that his head was up indicating he was awake a large hand was placed on his shoulder shaking him and in the process shook his companion as well. **"Stang Muurak!"** He said he brushed off the big aliens hand from his shoulder. **"I'm already awake."** Feeling her stir he looked at the big feline. **"We'll be out in a few moments."** He was sitting up disengaging Jakira from his arm when the door to the cabin closed. He cursed once again under his breath in irritation before leaning down to place a hand on her shoulder and a kiss on her cheek. **"Jakira its time to get up. We're just about there. I'm thinking its the blockade we heard them talk about earlier."** With one last kiss he rose off the bed and went to his armor where it had been neatly piled allowing him to quickly put it on.

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-07 22:19:30)

Jakira wasn't sure what she had been dreaming up until she and her companion were shaken from their slumber, or more accurately from hers. Her eyes snapped open and she found herself looking at the Togorian in annoyance before she tried to roll over to go back to sleep. She found her feet had been getting cold as Wes had pulled up the cloak to cover their chests exposing their lower halves. Finding it hard to go back to sleep with her companion stirring and giving her a gentle kiss in the process of urging her to get up. A shiver ran through her as she yawned and stretched, still laying beside Wes up until he climbed over her to get to his armor.
There was a small smile on her face until she realized what he had said. "**Did we sleep the whole trip?**" she wondered aloud, of course they didn't know when they were going to hit the blockade; it could have been only hours into the trip. Pulling her cloak around her shoulders she sat up to watch Wes for a long moment as he went through the process of 'dressing'. "**This better be good,**" she said finally, leaning down to pick up her boots and belt, getting them on in no time and standing to join Wes. Still cold she wrapped her cloak more tightly around herself as she opened the doors to the small quarters and made her way to the common area.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-07 23:52:23)

His hands worked quickly, perfectly in routine that he could have performed in his sleep. Feeling eyes upon him he looked up he saw that she was watching him put the pieces together. With some amount of irritation she commented on being woken up as she retrieved her boots and belt, putting them on. **"I hope so. I was just getting back to my dream. It's a shame it ended before it got started."** He chuckled. The look on her face proclaimed to the fact that she was still waking up so he didn't push it any farther as he finished up with the last of the pieces. Looking at Jakira he saw her small form moving for the door. Reaching down he retrieved his helmet and carbine. The latter he hooked to the sling he carried it from. He sighed looking at it. It was then he committed himself to finding a different holster to carry the weapon. **"I'll need credits for that."** Taking several long strides he followed Jakira out into the common area. Seeing Muurak there he gave the Togarian a nod. **"So what did you want us to see.?"**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-09 03:53:28)

As you entered into the common area, Muurak turns around and walks out of the cockpit to greet you.
**"Not much to see really, though I figured you had slept enough. Also, you probably want to be awake as Tek breaks the blockade. I´m not saying it´s going to get rough, but if we´re unlucky a cruising frigate is close enough to try and intercept us"**
Looking back at the cockpit, he gestured that you might want to go inside and take a look, and he follows you there. Tek is already positioned at the helm, though you can see that the ship hasn´t reverted into realspace yet. The big reptilian turns around to greet you with a smile.
**"Slept enough? Well, you´re just in time to watch the show"**
With a chuckle he pulls the controls that will disengage the hyperdrive. In a moments flash, the blue tunnel of hyperspace is replaced with a view of black space. In the distance you can see the planet Vrexa IV, hanging like a green orb against the black background. As the ship comes closer, the planet grows in size, and you also notices other shapes taking form. Most notably, you spots a very familiar, triangular shape in orbit around the planet. This shape is easily recognizable even to Wes, as the Empire hasn´t seen fit to alter the design of their Star Destroyers notably for more than a century. As it is rather far away though, it is of little concern. Those with good eyes can also make out a few smaller shapes in the distance, though they seem to mainly be hovering in place. Tek laughs to himself as he starts to calibrate an approach vector.
**"Let´s hope these drones are as lazy as they look, and they´ll never even see us coming through"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-10 13:49:17)

Having been greeted by the Togorian, Jakira does as suggested and steps into the cockpit, which is quickly becoming cramped. The lightscape outside the viewport makes her dizzy for a moment. Grasping hold of the nearest brace her fingers whiten as she grips it tightly, she never did like space travel. With the small jolt as the ship leaves lightspeed she looks up again through the port, taking in the sight of the surrounding space. A pit grows in her stomach as she spots the identifiable presence of the Sith in the triangular shaped vessel.
"**How likely are they to spot us?**" she asks. "**How much longer till planetfall?**" Now that they were in the system, she was eager to get her task though she would rather if they weren't shot down in the process.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-10 15:40:22)

Following Jakira to the cockpit, that now seemed unavoidably small with four occupants, he took up a position behind and to the right of his companion. With Muurak letting them in on what was about to happen he also found a hand hold.
With the reversion back to black space he began to scanning out the viewport. Seeing the planet he realized they still had a good distance to travel. Soon he was making out the distinctive shape of the Imperial Star Destroyer as well as other smaller ships. **"Doesn't look like the capital ships haven't changed much in the past few…years."**
Sensing her uneasiness grow a bit when the Sith ship began taking it's triangular form he placed an armored hand on her shoulder and spoke so all could hear. **"Their a long ways off we should be alright. It'll be the smaller ships we'll have to worry about."** Despite the reassurance she asked the two a couple of questions.
He waited with her for their answer as he watched the events unfold ahead of them in the distance.
<span style="font-size: 0.80em;">***[ Post made via Mobile Device ]***</span>

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-12 23:17:32)

**"Oh, they´re quite likely to spot us. In fact, they probably already have"**
Tek didn´t look overly concerned though. He made a couple of adjustments on the control panel, and the ship surged forward with sudden acceleration.
**"Unlucky for them, this ship is a little bit faster than their cannons can handle"**
As the reptilian went back to the controls, Muurak turned to Jakira and Wes, thinking they might need a bit more information.
**"Once we breach the atmosphere, we´ll be safe from those ships. You see, Vrexa IV is a mining colony, and the Sith are rather concerned with keeping the facilities intact, so they´ll stay away from orbital bombardment around those areas. And it just so happens that we´ve set up our bases in the mining facilities. And with the upgraded weapons and military-grade shields on this ride, smaller craft are less of a threat"**
Almost as on cue, when Muurak finished, the ship jerked violently, and a brilliant green blaster bolt passed in front of the viewport. Apparently the ship had moved in range of the capital ships weapons, and they seemed eager to fire.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-13 13:27:36)

Holding on as the ship increased speed Wes listened as Muurak explained how they had set up bases in the mining facilities on be planet. And since the Sith were eager to keep things intact they were left pretty much alone, ie. no orbital bombardments.
He nodded agreeing with the Togorian as it made gold sense to use whatever they could against the Sith. Thought a problem remained. **"What happens when the rebels and the Raiders become more of a problem that the facility is worth?**
As if on queue a bright flash of green energy streaked by outside the viewport as the capitol ship opened up with a turbo laser battery.
<span style="font-size: 0.80em;">***[ Post made via Mobile Device ]***</span>

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-14 01:54:04)

As if the question had been expected, the Togorian just smiled and chuckled.
**"We´re hoping to resolve the situation before it comes to that. Vrexa has got its own garrison of starfighters, and even a planetary defense shield, but all of that is controlled from the capital. That´s why we´ve been trying to find a way in that can allow us to capture those things. At the moment, all we have are the craft that we brought to the planet, and that makes no fleet"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-14 08:21:36)

Wes simply nodded in agreement at the Togorians words. The quicker this could all be wrapped up the better. Still though a garrison of starfighters is hardly a fleet when put up against a Star Destroyer.
Shifting his weight slightly he modified his stance for better support. **"Well then the quicker you get us down there the sooner we can begin to get things sorted out."** His armored hand, still on Jakira's shoulder, gave a slight squeeze before withdrawing.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-14 13:14:28)

The transport streaks forward, and even though the fire from the approaching frigate intensifies, the smaller vessel slides untouchable through the fire. Tek takes good care in keeping his distance to the larger ship as he closes in on the planet, apparently trying to discourage them from launching fighter craft. While it may be nimble enough to evade capital ship fire, what you saw of the outside of the ship didn´t paint it as a vessel suited for dogfighting, and would likely last a rather short time against a wave of Imperial starfighters.
No enemy craft are launched though, and just as Muurak predicted, as you breach the atmosphere of the planet, the turbolaser fire has died out. Below you see a lush and green planet, filled with forests and oceans, including a few smaller lakes. You also notices plenty of mountain ranges, one in particular stretching for what must be thousands of miles, like a spine of the planet. It is towards this ridge that Tek pilots the craft. In the distance, you can also spy a large metropolitan area, which is most likely the capital of the planet. As you draw closer to the mountains you notice a smaller settlement, and with the many massive entrances into the mountains, you assume that this is one of the mining facilities mentioned earlier.
Tek guides the ship into one of the openings, and settles her down on a landing platform. You see many people on your flight in, but most only pays the incoming vessel a fleeting interest. Once settled, Tek remains behind to shut down the ship, while Muurak takes Wes and Jakira outside. As you descend from the ships ramp, a small group of people approaches you. They are mostly human, but there is also a couple of Twi'leks and a Wookie among them. Only two people really stands out form the crowd: A young human female, probably in her late twenties and with black hair cut short to complement her brown eyes. She wears a grey uniform, similar to what many others you´ve seen are wearing, but hers is lined with red and blue stripes here and there, indicating some position of rank. The other is a rather old human male with graying hair wearing a set of worn battle armor, with what appears to be a small pistol or a large rifle in a holster at his side. While the female might in a way look more like she is the boss of something, the aura of command the older man exudes makes it crystal clear who´s in charge.
The old man first lays his eyes on Muurak, and then turns to Wes and Jakira. Smiling, he looks back to Muurak.
**"Well, look what the cat dragged in…"**
Laughing, he removes an armored glove as he steps forward and extends his hand to the two newcomers.
**"General Roland Wann, head of the Crimson Raiders. I trust your trip wasn´t made to unpleasant by my two Lieutenants. They might be a bit rough around the edges, but they´re the best I´ve got"**
((
Just as a technical comment here, when I say "mile", I mean 10 km and not an American/English mile. Just to avoid confusion.
))

### **Alicia** (2011-03-14 13:51:59)

During the trip to the growing planet's orbit, Jakira's grip on the back of the chair tightened up until she made an effort to let go, her hand instead dropping to her side. She half listened to Wes's questions before he turned to leave, a soft squeeze on her shoulder his parting. Not wanting to stay in the cockpit longer than she needed to, she turned to follow him. Taking a seat on the couch, she tugged on the folds of her cloak and held on as the ship rocked with each hit.
She sighed visibly as she felt the ship land and followed Muurak out, glad to finally be off the ship. Having collected her gear, she disembarked behind the Togorian. Adjusting her kit over one shoulder she took the general's hand, a small smile gracing her face. "**Their manner of recruitment could use some work, but they were otherwise gracious hosts,**" she said smoothly. Releasing his hand she took another look at the others in the general's retinue. "**While I'd love to stand here and chat, General. I've been told you have an epidemic on your hands. Frankly I'd love to hear why you felt I could be of help, but I'm here and would rather be caught up to speed on what you know of it.**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-14 16:53:18)

Wes gave her a nod as she too the seat on the couch next to him. He knew that she really didn't like space travel all that much. Add in some blaster fire to make it a bumpy ride and he had a feeling that she disliked it even more. Laying his head back against the back of the couch he let his eyes close despite the rough ride. If he had wanted to he might have even been able to sleep a bit.
With the ship setting down he picked up his head and looked at his companion. As she gathered her things he reached for the surgical kit that he had been carrying for her and put it easily over a shoulder. Following the Togorain and Jakira down the ships ramp he took in his surroundings taking in area and personnel. In particular the group that was advancing on the ship. Most didn't get a second glance but two stood out among them. A human woman and male and while the woman was young the man was was her opposite. The presence from both was obvious but it was clear who ran the show here.
Adjusting the kit and his helmet, that is stowed under his arm, he follows Jakira's lead and extends his hand to the elder man. **"Wes Del-Fin."** He said with a nod. As Jakira started asking for information on the crisis that they had been recruited for. Information in which he was rather looking forward to hearing about from the person running the show.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-15 15:47:15)

**"Certainly. Allow me to introduce Andrea Forsic, administrator of this particular mining facility, and head of the resistance movement"**
The General turned to indicate the black-haired woman behind him, and she took a step forward to shake the hands of the two newcomers. Seemingly happy that introductions were taken care of, General Wann starts to walk, with Andrea, Wes and Jakira following. Muurak quietly heads back towards the ship, likely to help Tek finish up.
**"While I hardly think it can be classified as an epidemic, we nevertheless stand powerless to counter it at the moment. I am sure Muurak and Tek gave you the rundown on how he situation were when they left to find you, and that´s still pretty much it. The number of infection have decreased significantly, which must mean that some of our quarantine efforts are working. However, we still have no idea how to treat those infected, and we have had several more deaths in the past days. We may have the advantage now, but it won´t be long before the supplies we have secured starts to dwindle. And without positive knowledge of how the infection spreads, I am hesitant to take advantage of the supplies that we are not one hundred percent certain does not carry any infection"**
Opening a door leading into a wide corridor into the mountain, he continues, and you can see that his face grows a bit more worried.
**"We are one of the better suited facilities in regards to supplies, and we can probably last another week or so on what we have, but other colonies are not so fortunate. The oceanic colony have already started calling in reports of failing supplies of "pure" food.
I guess this is where you come in, doctor. In addition to trying to find a cure for this thing, I ask that you try to establish a positive contamination report on the supply stashes that we have quarantined, so we can be sure whether they are useful or not. The facility here is equipped with a medical lab of moderate capacity. It is far from cutting edge, but it fills some basic needs. If you wish to enter the quarantined areas, please let me know, and I will give you a greater rundown of what procedures we have in place"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-15 22:45:52)

Wes fell in line behind the General and Andrea and listened as The man gave a rundown of the situation to Jakira. Even with his limited medical knowledge things didn't sound good and now they were right in the thick of it. Giving Jakira a sidelong glance he shrugged his shoulders as this information was certainly out of his scope of ability. While he'd help her in any way he could he had the feeling that they may not be seeing much of each other for the foreseeable future.
It was easy to see the worry on Wann's face as he spoke. It was clear that he wanted to help. While he agreed with Jakira that his lieutenants recruitment methods were less than desirable the act of finding them was almost desperate. He had questions he wanted to ask several actually but he also wanted to wait till Jakira had received all the information she could get.
Looking to Andrea who had been quiet up till now he moved a bit closer so his voice didn't disturb the General and Jakira. **"Whats the sit rep here on the ground? From what Muurak said the Sith have a battalion of troopers they can call on not to mention the possibility of actual Sith Force users in orbit. What are you looking at as far as numbers for both sides?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-15 23:11:58)

After nodding to the young woman beside General Wann and shaking her hand she eagerly followed close along behind as the older man led them through the mountain complex. She listens as the general speaks as he walks, glad he wasn't wasting more time than the obviously didn't have. It disappointed her to know there wasn't much information already gathered but she supposed she should have suspected as much. Muraak had mentioned most of them only knew basic first aid. It was perhaps an astonishing feat they had managed to set up a suitable quarantine to slow its progress. "**I'll do what I can. It's probable that by examining for the source clues may arise as to what has infected your people. I'll need details on the methods you're using for the quarantine as well as any records you've made regarding its origins, how its spread and all that,**" she said with a wave of her hand. Not for the first time she got the feeling she was getting herself in for a long haul.
She paused looking back at Wes as he began walking in line with the mine's administrator, starting up a conversation with the human woman. As the leader of the resistance, the young woman must have a heavy burden on her shoulders. She knew Wes would probably find some way to be useful to them. Finally her attention turned back to the general's worry drawn faceand her thoughts returned to the business at hand. "**What sort of staff and resources can I expect? It would be helpful to me to have people collect reports from those infected as well as collect and analyze samples. The more I know, the better the chance to fight it.**"

**"That´s pretty much the situation as it is. According to the observations of troop ships landing and taking off from the capital, we estimate that they have landed about one battalion of stormtroopers there, and they have most of the planets active militia as well. The ones that weren´t killed out in the settlements by us that is. So I would say they have about 5-600 soldiers at their command, but I don´t know about any actual Sith.
As for ourselves, we have the forty men I brought with me here, and a couple hundred volunteers from the civilians. Not the best odds perhaps, so you can see why we are trying to find some way to get inside the walls to strike at them from within"**
I was obvious by the tone of the General that he was clearly more comfortable talking about strategies, numbers, and things he were used to fighting, rather than the abstract foe he had now encountered in the form of a bioweapon. Also, he sounded clearly confident of the abilities of him and his team, even though numbers and the fact that the enemy had the capital to fortify themselves in spoke against them.
As Jakira started asking him questions, it was Andrea who answered.
**"We have done hat we can to isolate those infected in secure wings of the facilities, and allows no one to visit them without protective gear. Also, as the general already told you, we have been very careful using only supplies we know to be 100 % clear of contamination. We do what we can to treat the various symptoms displayed by the infected, in the degree that we know how to. The infection first started to spread in a remote colony located on the other side of the planet, little more than a week ago.
As for what gear and personnel we have available, we have some basic medical equipment and a simple lab that you can use, and some people who have more than basic first aid skills. It is not a full hospital with doctors, but it´s what we have to work with"**
She halted at a larger set of double doors.
**"In here is our lab. Further in we have the Ward, which we have converted to quarantine area to isolate those infected. If you want to go in there, we will need to change into something more protective"**

### **Alicia** (2011-03-16 23:05:45)

Jakira was perhaps a little surprised when the two switched roles, the administrator Wes had been attempting to initiate conversation taking over the general's. The Zeltron doctor gave the woman her undivided attention as they continued to walk and stopped with her outside the double doors. "**Even those with rudimentary first aid you can spare I can use. Anyone who can be taught if they are willing will be useful for what I need.**" Not waiting, Jakira moved to open the doors to see the facilities she was to be working in.
"**I will mainly need a collection of samples from the suspect stores so I can begin running tests as well as samples from the patients within the ward.**" Giving the woman a small, reassuring smile. "**The former is certainly something those eager to help with no medical training will be able to accomplish, and anyone with basic first aid can do the latter or be taught if they don't.**" In such a situation it was likely there were many people who wanted to help but didn't know how. Hopelessness wasn't going to help anyone.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-16 23:45:00)

Wes had to change gears as the General took control of talking about enemy strengths and Andrea the medical crisis. Turing his head he looked at General Wann as he spoke. From what Muurak had said the numbers hadn't changed much. The Raiders and resistance were still outnumbered. A direct assault on the city would fail that was clear as they would need numbers they didn't have. But he liked the idea of getting inside.
**"What ideas have you got for getting inside?"** He looked around once again taking note that they were in a mining facility. **"General, if you have the equipment, have you given thought to going under the city walls to strike from the inside."** It made sense and perhaps they had already figured out a strategy like that. **"General while I can't help like Jakira can with the bio weapon I can help you and your forces in trying to breach the city. I've…,"** He paused for a second. **"Seen my fair share of action so to speak."**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-22 08:53:08)

As Jakira looked into the medical facility, it was pretty much what might have been expected. It was a medium-sized room, and on the shelves and desks lining one half of it she saw various medical equipment (blood pressure meters, syringes, scalpels, etc) and medicine bottles. In the other half, she saw four medical beds, complete with some basic monitoring equipment. Andrea walked in next to her and swept her hand across the room.
**"This is pretty much it I´m afraid. We´re pretty much equipped to treat mining-related injuries and basic ailments, and our current situation is a little more extreme. We have been reluctant to take the infected in here to hook them up to the surveillance gear on the beds, what with the risk of spreading the infection and all, but maybe it will be worth it? I will get some people to bring down a few crates of the supplies we´ve been unwilling to use so far. What kind of samples would you want us to take from the infected?"**
While the two women talked, General Wann turned to look back at Wes.
**"We have discarded ideas of making new holes in the walls. By the time we´re through, they´ll have massed all their forces on the other side, not to mention they´ll shoot at us while we drill. Going under is an interesting idea though, and it is something we´ve considered. Making a tunnel would take quite a while though, but we know that there are a series of tunnels already in place under the city. You know, for utility stuff like drainage, water, and so on. Now, unless they are completely braindead, the Imperials must have some patrols down there, but it will most likely be less resistance than a frontal assault. Besides, the terrain down there would surely be to our advantage. Problem is though, we need to find a quick route through the tunnels leading to someplace where we can hit them hard. If we get stuck too long down in those tunnels, they´ll either shut down all internal exits, or rig an ambush for us at each one"**
Taking a moment to look over at Jakira and Andrea still talking, the General smiled at the Mandalorian warrior.
**"I don´t know how you feel about leaving your girlfriend there, but if you feel like making yourself useful, I´m sending out Muurak and Tek to take a look at those tunnels. While they have the muscle and the guts, they sometimes lack the ability to see the big picture. I´m getting a feeling that you might have more tactical skill than those two put together"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-22 11:30:14)

Wes nodded at General Wann talked about plans that have discarded and others that had been put to the table. Going underground made sense. Problem was that if it made sense to him and the Raiders, it probably made sense to the Imperials as well.
He shifted his stance slightly as he grabbed his helmet with his left hand. Letting his arm fall to his side he followed the Generals gaze to where Jakira and Andrea were talking. Looking back at the general he saw the smile the man was giving him and had an idea of what may be coming. He was only partially right when he began speaking again.
**"I'd be happy to help you General Wann. My skills experience followed a different path that of Jakira's no doubt."** He looked back over at his companion as he sent her a warm touch through the Force. Bringing his head back around to the General he smiled. **"Just don't let her beauty and appearance fool you. In the time I've spent with her she's shown herself to be stronger and more resilient than most I have met and fought alongside with."** He paused for a moment before switching gears as he prepared himself to get to work. **"I know you're not selling Murrak and Tex short but sometimes despite the best laid tactical plan you just need some plain brute force to make things work. We had to resort to that several times back in the war."** He added the last with a slight nod as he remembered fighting alongside clan mates against the Vong. Only now that war was a distant memory for the people of this era of Imperials and Sith running loose on the galaxy.
Taking a breath he nodded. **"Yes General I'll be ready anytime."**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-22 11:45:28)

At Wes´s comment on the use of brute force, the General couldn´t hold back a laugh.
**"Hah! Right you are lad, and if I´d let them, those two´d probably tear the whole capital apart. Most likely with their bare hands as well. But we need a little more subtlety than that now don´t we? You see, I´m thinking that if we manage to infiltrate the capital and take the Imperial forces there by surprise, once they lose enough power, the people on that destroyer in orbit might start to think we´ve become more trouble than we´re worth. And when that happens, we´d better be ready for it"**
He stopped talking for a while, and dug up a small holorecorder from his belt and handed it to Wes.
**"Here´s what I want you to do: Find a way through those tunnels that can get my men as close as possible to the hangar as fast as possible. I´m not sure exactly where it is, but it should be somewhere in the northern section of the city, from what I´ve been told. We´ll need the ships in there once the big guns starts to blaze, that is top priority. And while you´re in there, find as much as you can that will help us take them out quickly. I mean anything, sniper points, narrow corridors or other kill zones, or a vehicle garage we might get into. Use the recorder to capture anything valuable, as well as possible problems that we need to work on solving when you get back. I think you´ll find the boys in the hangar, suiting up. Good luck out there"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-22 16:02:37)

Jakira listend to Andrea as she poked around the small medbay, taking in what sort of medicines were on hand as well as memorizing where everything was located. As she moved to inspect the beds and their equipment, she first checked to see if any of it could be moved to be used in the ward. "**There are ways to isolate an infected in here, but yes. It could be worth it as long as we take precautions.**" Turning back around to face the young woman, she leaned against the bed. "**I'll need blood and tissue samples as well as take a history. I'll write up what information I need. Samples from the remains of anyone who has passed would be useful as well. In fact, while I've heard there isn't much left once the disease has run it's course, I would like to perform an autopsy.** "
She stopped as she felt the touch coming from Wes, her gaze meeting his. Sending him a small smile she turned her gaze back to the mine's administrator. "**There isn't much I can do till aside from treating the sympotms till I know more about how the disease works as a whole.**" Looking back at Wes as he resumed his conversation with the General, she realized that perhaps soon they would be parting company. Their line of work would take them on seperate paths from this point on till the situation was resolved. A part of her was sad for it, but it couldn't be helped.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-22 17:17:58)

Wes took the offered holorecorder from the man and looked it over as he listened to the instructions the General had. What he wanted was pretty much straight forward, gather whatever intel they could. With a nod he quickly put the recorder into his utility belt where it would be relatively safe for the mean time. **"Understood General. We'll get what you need and hopefully then we can figure out the best course of action."** With a brief exchange of words he got directions to the hanger bay where Tek and Muurak would be prepping for the recon.
With a nod he turned from the man towards Jakira and Andrea. Taking a few steps he came up beside his companion and placed a armored hand gently against her lower back. He knew this time was going to come where they would be going different ways he just wished it didn't have to be as soon as this. Still it wouldn't do either of them any good to dwell on it. The sooner they did what needed to be done the better. **"Sorry to interrupt."** He said to the two women. Turning his head to look at Jakira his facial expression softened when his brown eyes locked on hers. **"It seems that the General has something for me to do. I'll be heading out for some recon with Tek and Muurak into the underground tunnels and passageways under the city in an effort to find some way in. I'm not sure how long we'll be out."** He looked like he wanted to say more but held off for the moment. It was obvious from the Generals remark that they knew he and Jakira were more than traveling companions. He just wasn't sure on how obvious he wanted to make among their present company.

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-22 21:48:28)

Jakira stood up straighter from where she leaned against the medical bed as Wes put his hand at the small of her back, giving him a small smile in return. In present company she knew he wouldn't appreciate any open affection so she restrained herself. Her Mandalorian companion seemed to put a lot of stock into his tough guy persona and he certainly wasn't when he interacted with her. While he could turn into the hardened warrior in an instant, she more often than not saw the kind man she had grown to love. They'd spend the last few weeks in each other's company, it was going to be strange not having him nearby. All things considered, neither of them were going to have much of a chance to really miss each other.
She nodded slowly, a conspiratorial smile gracing her features. "**No new holes,**" she teased, jabbing a finger into his shoulder where weeks ago she had sealed the first of his wounds, a stab wound, she had encountered. "**I won't be there to fix you up.**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-22 23:07:44)

Wes smiled as she jabbed him with a finger against his armored shoulder warning him to be careful. At that moment he didn't care who was around. As the woman he fallen in love with was before him telling him to not get hurt. He almost laughed and the full smile that came to his face showed what he was feeling. **"I know, I'll be careful. You too though right? I wont be here to throw you over my shoulder and carry you out of harms way."** He playfully shot back as he looked at Andrea and remembered where he was. Quickly his expression hardened slightly but the smile, though smaller, remained as he took a deep breath and looked back to Jakira. Slowly he moved closer to her giving her a light kiss. The expression of affection surprised even him. There was no doubt in his mind that she was changing him. A change that was for the better.

---

### **Alicia** (2011-03-24 10:00:09)

There was a sweet smile on her face as he laughed and looked down on her with his own. With a wave of her hand she dismissed his own fears, and couldn't help but to laugh as well, her annoyance over the joke having longed passed. It had taken sometime for her to finally come to terms with had happened on Solsis, though she had realized she had been more angry with herself than with this man who had braved Jakira's ire to get her off the planet. "**Don't worry about me, trouble follows you, remember?**" She savored his kiss, his way of sharing with her his feelings in public. Taking a deep breath when it was over, she resisted the urge to make it a proper kiss. Instead she reached out and shoved him toward the door. "**Get out of here before I change my mind and ask you to stay.**" She had decided she wasn't going to say goodbye. There seemed to be a bit too much finality in the word.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-24 12:43:51)

Wes chuckled as he backed up from her push his eyes dancing from the brief kiss they shared. **"I'll be back before you know it cyar'ika. Maybe then you can get the kiss you really wanted."** He said with a wink as he took a couple more backwards steps before turning for the exit with a quick pace. Once again he smiled and shook his head slightly at term of endearment he used in parting. ***Yes, you are changing and all it's taking is the love of that wonderful woman.*** The thought passed through his mind as he realized that he didn't care. With the experiences of the last month he was beginning to realize that life was too short to miss out on the things that matter.
Following the directions that General Wann gave him he settled his mind on the task set before him as he once again slipped into the warriors mindset. It didn't take long to reach the hanger that witch was surprisingly active. Looking around for Tek and Muurak it didn't take long to spot the two large beings. Advancing on the two he called out as he got closer. **"Tek, Muurak. The General asked if I would head out with you two on the recon mission. You don't mind another along I hope?"** He said with a nod of his head in greeting.

### **Alicia** (2011-03-24 15:35:18)

Jakira gave him a playful pout, her arms crossing over her chest as she leaned back on the bed once more to watch as he left. "**K'oyacyi, cyar'ika,**" she said under her breath, using the spluttering vocabulary Wes had shared with her.
She watched his retreating form till he was gone and then turned her attention back to her task at hand. There was something to be said in how the treated their work, being practical neither one of them would dwell on the fact they each had their own tasks which couldn't be done together. There was too much at stake for it to be otherwise.
After getting another look at the beds she picked up a spare datapad from one of the stores, writing down the various questions she wanted the infected to answer. Ranging from inquiries to the order symptoms appeared to when as well as their activities before having contracted the illness. Also included was the standard information any physician would want to know for a standard history.
She wasn't sure yet what would be useful but doubted at this point there was such a thing as too much information to be had.
Handing the pad to Andrea she added, "**Here's what I want as well as the samples. To start they should concentrate on a selection of those who have been ill the longest and the most recent.**" Glancing at the doors to the ward she added, "**I think I'll have a look at the ward now."**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-24 16:39:51)

Andrea nodded to Jakira as she gave the additional instructions.
**"I´ll get people on collecting the samples you need. If you want, I can also request that samples be transferred from neighboring facilities. It will take some time, but maybe it can be useful?"**
At the mention of an autopsy, the woman seemed visibly troubled, and her cheeks blushed a bit.
**"Ah, well…you see…as you´ve been told, there isn´t much left of those deceased, and what´s left is mostly a kind of gelatinous goo. We haven´t been sure what to do with it, so we´ve kind of…stored it, in a secure container. It probably won´t do to make an autopsy on, but I suppose you might be able to take some samples of it"**
She remained quiet as Wes and Jakira had their moment, and as the Mandalorian left the room, followed by the General, she turned back to Jakira. Waving one hand towards the doors to the Ward, she nodded.
**"Of course. You´ll have to excuse me, but I have some things to take care of, but someone is always on station inside and they should be able to help you. Just remember to make sure your protective gear is on tight"**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-24 16:57:51)

As Wes approached, the Togorian and Dashasde turned to look at him. They looked quite different from when he saw them the last time, and now had more the appearance of actual mercenaries rather than street thugs. While Muurak still wore the same pants he had before, but he had exchanged his jacket for a seemingly more durable armored vest. At the waist, looking like a recent addition, was attached several plates of what Wes recognized to be a soft synthmaterial often used as padding in military armors. From a belt at his waist dangled a heavy blaster pistol in its holster at hip height, and on the opposite hip was strapped a power hammer. On his left forearm, the feline carried a portable computer, and just under a red bandana tied around his forehead he wore some sort of interface visor.
Tek, on the other hand, wore the same long coat as he had before, but this time Wes could spot a set of light armor underneath, instead of bare muscles. He could also spot a couple of blaster pistols carried in holsters on the reptilians waistband. But more importantly, the attitude of Tek looked different, and the raw, antagonistic humor he had experienced before seemed to have been suppressed in favor of a more rough professionalism. As he shoved a large knife down into a sheath in his boot, the Dashade looked up at Wes.
**Nah. Wann usually has a feeling for people, and he wouldn´t have sent ya if he thought you´d mess things up. You do hear a couple of things about your kind after all. You got everything you need?**

### **Alicia** (2011-03-24 19:36:45)

"**Having samplings from the other areas would be useful. Thank you, Andrea,**" the Zeltron doctor said with a smile, finding the notion she wouldn't put the quarentine attire on tight enough amusing. "**Who should I contact if I need anything else?**" After getting the details she watched as Andrea left, leaving her alone in the medbay. With a sigh, she took a look around, testing herself as to where things were before her gaze arrived on the ward's doors. Knowing she would have to go through it at some point, she approached the doors, her medical kit in hand, pulling them aside.
Upon entering, she went through the quarantine procedures, taking care to ensure she didn't expose herself. She kept on the lookout for the personnel Andrea mentioned would always be on duty.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-03-24 21:45:49)

Wes was looking the two over taking notice of their gear. He almost felt sorry for any Imperials they ran into. They won't know what hit them. He nodded at Tek's question about equipment. **"Yeah I'm ready to go. I tend to travel light. I also have a holorecorder that General Wann gave me to use."**
He looked around to see if there were any others that may be going. He was going to ask something else but what Tek said made him pause. **"What stories have you heard about, my kind."** He asked questingly. Since waking up he only knew of one other Mandalorian and even then the two of them didn't have much chance to talk. Even Jakira hadn't known much. He was beginning to wonder if the clans were still active and who's side they may be fighting on.

**"You can contact me if you need anything, and if you can´t find me for some reason, talk to General Wann. Ever since he and his men arrived here, he´s become something of a leader around here. People turn to me because I´m their boss, but him…well there´s just something about him"**
With a pleasant smile to Jakira, the young woman left the room. After looking around the room some more, Jakira went through the doors that would lead her to the Ward. It was a short walk, until she found another set of double doors, covered in some sort of makeshift quarantine tent. After double-checking her gear was on straight, she went through it. On entering the room behind the doors, she spotted several plain and simple beds with people lying in them, covered by a number of thick blankets. Most of the people looked rather normal, but she could spot symptoms of common afflictions such as fevers and skin rashes on several of them.
At a desk off to the side she spotted a couple of people currently occupied with playing a game of pazaak at the table, both wearing protective gear similar to her own. As she came into the room, they looked up at her, and she could hear a slightly robotic voice coming through the external speakers of their suits.
**"Yes? Can we help you with anything?"**

### **Alicia** (2011-03-27 10:25:05)

"**Yes, I'm Doctor Jakira. General Wann sent for me to help with your… situation,**" she said, turning back to look at the patients with a frown. "**Please brief me on your patients here. Have you been keeping charts for them?**" Not waiting for the two, she heads to the first of the beds, pulling out her customized medical scanner from her bag. Sweeping it over the first of the patients, she took in the readings and using the tool tried to evaluate the patient's condition.

**"Not a lot really, but you guys are supposed to be rather handy in a fight. The General seems to know some stuff though, but then he´s been around for a while"**
Checking to make sure that the large knife was securely in place, the reptilian straightened up. Waving for Wes to follow, he headed off to another section of the hangar, where they found two swoop bikes that looked ready to go.
**"I hope you ain´t afraid of a little speed, these babies will take us where we need to be in no time. You ride the backseat behind the furball here, and do try to keep up. We don´t have a lot of time to waste"**
Without further instructions, Tek walked over and powered up one of the swoops. As the massive Dashade sat down on it vehicle, it sank a little closer to the ground, but soon stabilized itself. Walking past Wes and getting on the other bike, Muurak gave him an assuring look as he hinted for the Mandalorian to get behind him.
**"Don´t worry, I had the safety inhibitors of these adjusted, and they can support far more weight than they were originally made for. Also trimmed them a bit, make them go fast than anything the Imps have deployed here"**

**Alicia**
Sweeping the medscanner over the patient, Jakira received a summary of body temperature, current levels of common and necessary substances in blood and skin cells, as well as several other readouts, providing a full medical diagnosis of the patient. The result was perhaps not alarming, but a bit puzzling. The subjects skin temperature seemed to be at above normal levels, which might indicate a fever of some kind, but at the same time the scanner showed decreased activity in several "secondary" organs, which is usually indicative of hypothermia. There was also a noticeable shortage in three vitamin levels, as well as a higher than normal production of gastric acid.
One of the two persons seated at the desk got up to stand next to Jakira as she checked the readouts from her scanner.
**"We have doctor. This man here fell ill about five days ago, and as you can see he is showing a variety of symptoms. He came in to us from fixing some atmospheric equipment on the roofs, and at first we weren´t sure that it was anything serious, just a case of the cold. But with all the things going on here, we didn´t take any risks, and as it turns out, he soon started to show other symptoms as well. We have stored the logs for all of them out in the terminal in the medbay if you want to take a look at them"**

Wes simply nodded as Tek gave his answer. He kept his face neutral as his disappointment at not finding out much. Maybe the General like he said knew more. Not wasting any time he quickly put on his helmet and secured it making the seal as he followed the two to another section of the hanger. He nodded his head appreciatively at the two mean looking bikes. He watched as the two mounted the machines and saw that they had indeed been modified for their size and weight.
**"This should be interesting."** He said as he secured his weapon and climbed up behind the feline. He looked over to Tek and nodded. **"I'm wondering how long it will be before your eating our dust."** He voice sounded out from his helmet with a hint of amusement. He had a feeling that these two like a bit of competition and he figured he add to it. Finding a place to hold on to weather the was grips on the bike itself or the Togarian if need be he made him self ready. **"I'm good back here lets see what we can find."** He said as he settled in for the ride.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-28 22:45:21)

**Yogi**
Wes barely had time to settle in behind the massive Togorian before the two swoops took off for the open hangar doors. He noticed that Muurak hadn´t been kidding, the bikes had obviously been trimmed, and they soared forward at incredible speeds. As they headed down the mountain slope, it became clear that Tek was the better rider, but both of the mercenaries had no trouble keeping their swoops stable.
It was hard to hear anything with the speed wind soaring around your head, and it seemed Muurak was quite aware of that, and didn´t try to initiate any kind of conversation with Wes. though the Mandalorian supposed it might have been that it took more concentration than it appeared to keep the bike steady. Between the two mercenaries though, they exchanged a few short signals and signs, but Wes had no idea what they were really saying.
Once down from the mountain, they slowed down somewhat given the thickness of the forest terrain they entered. The wind slightly weaker now, the Togorian called back to Wes.
**"We should be coming up on the capital in an hour or two, so let me know if you need a break. We´ll stop some klicks away and approach the rest on foot"**

---

As the bike took off Wes was glad that he had taken a strong grip on the bike. Tek wasn't kidding when he mentioned that the bikes had been trimmed as the hanger soon turned into the mountainside that they were fast descending. With the noise levels what they were he kept quiet and simply watched the two operate. After a few minutes it was clear that Tex was the better rider though Muurak held his own with no problems. Thinking ahead it would be good to know the strengths of the two before they walked into the Imperial held city. Knowing the strengths of the men you worked with made things a lot easier.
As they leveled out and the forest vegetation became denser the speed that the two first showed dropped off slightly allowing for conversation between him and Muurak at least. As the Torgarian yelled back about the rest of the trip he simply nodded even though it wasn't seen. **"Don't worry about me I'm all set back here. Maybe I'll even catch a nap."** He jested as he rode but quickly spoke up again. **"Hey I want to make sure that we swap comm codes when we stop. Last thing we need is to become separated and have no means of communicating."** With that said he settled into the seat and actually enjoyed the ride as he ran through scenarios of what they could encounter. To say that in this down time that some of the recent times he had spent with Jakira didn't find their way into his thoughts would have been a lie. Thankfully he was wearing his helmet and they were traveling at a high rate of speed that caused the pair to keep eyes forward. If either had seen his smile they would have wondered what he was thinking.

Beneath the helmet of the suit the young Zeltron doctor frowned at the puzzling readouts. "**Yes…**" she started the strange mechanizations of her own voice odd to her own ears. Holding the scanner in the crook of her arm, she turned to look at the "nurse" wondering what was behind the suit. "**What treatments has he been given?**" she inquired, a list of what could aid the ailing man going through her mind, the foremost of getting a proper IV going with the vitamins he needed. Depending on the nurse's response she says as much before going on to the next patient, scanning each of them in turn in search of commonalities in the illness.
"**I'd like the two of you to begin taking blood and tissue samples from each of the patients, starting with a selection of those who have contracted it most recently and who have had it the longest.**"

**"We´ve been treating his symptoms to our best ability. Cold wrappings and fluids to counter the fevers, thermal insulation blankets against the cold. But if you thinks it will help, we shall see if we can´t get an IV going"**
The woman waved towards the other person present, who nods and leaves the room. She listens carefully to what Jakira says, and then nods her approval.
**"Yes doctor, we will begin collecting our samples at once. Is there anything else?"**
As Jakira scans the rest of the patients, they all show a similar pattern of statistics, with some having gone further than others and having a wider range of symptoms.

The ride proceeds in its rapid pace, and even through his armor, Wes can feel the winds around them, and sleep isn´t really an option. Not that it might have been a good idea in the first place, as simply the facts of what would happen to one that falls of a swoop in his sleep at this speed should keep anyone awake. It was impossible to tell if Muurak hadn´t heard him talk or if he simply didn´t bother answering, but communication remained at a minimum during the trip.
As they swept through the forests, Wes could catch glimpses of massive structures in the distance, and he was guessing they were getting closer to the capital. In a while, the swoops slowed down, and eventually they stopped in a secluded forest spot, covering themselves behind the trunks of a few massive fallen trees. Once the bikes were powered down, the two aliens quickly dismounted them and did a quick weapons check. When he was done, Tek waved for his two companions to follow.
**"We´re about 2 clicks from the city now, and about 1,5 from where our source says the entrance tunnels should be. It is a remote hatch, placed to allow access to the utility lines under the city from the outside in case of say, an earthquake or a city flood. Luckily for us, it is also an excellent way to enter the place quietly"**

### **Alicia** (2011-04-04 20:09:54)

Jakira shakes her head as she looks over the latest batch of puzzling readings, but she knew that somehow all the symptoms pointed to a leading cause. It was a puzzle she was going to have to put together. "**Please bring me the first batch of samples ASAP. Till then I'm going to be reviewing their charts.**" Taking a last look at the ward and the patients residing within in, she gives her newest assistants a chance to voice their questions and comments. The realization they hadn't introduced themselves troubled her. She guessed she had for too long relied on the familiarity of her own staff, her focus on her work distracted her from her learned manners. Before turning to leave she addresses the two nurses, **I didn't catch your names.**"

### **Yogi** (2011-04-05 13:18:59)

The ride was quick through the forest. Between the sound of the speeder and the wind rushing by Wes simply settled in behind Muurak and patiently waited. During the early part of the trek he had been able to make out large buildings in the distance that they were heading towards. Figuring that was their destination he did his best to keep track of where they were going. He knew that without a speeder it would be a long walk back.
Good to their word they were slowing down around ninety later. With the bikes stowed away in a secluded by a couple of massive felled trees Wes was looking towards the city. He once more went over his equipment and followed Tek when the large reptile motioned for them to follow. Wed nodded as he listened to the update. When Tek finished he made sure to swap comm codes with the two.
They weren't far from the city and they now needed to get to the tunnels quietly and unseen. **"Sounds good. Let's hope your source is reliable. Is there anyone on the inside who is sympathetic to your cause. It would make things easier when the time comes."**

**"Oh, I´m sorry. I guess since this whole thing broke out, we´ve been all business down here. And with the blockade in place, we don´t get many newcomers, so everyone pretty much knows everyone. My name is Evy, and my colleague is named Jacob. We will try to get you the samples as soon as we can"**
Supposing that the conversation might be over, Evy returns to her desk. With Jacob running about, she might be unwilling to leave the ward completely unattended, which would be understandable.

**"I´m afraid not. That´s why we´re out here. We got the info from a few colonists who had apparently been assisting in its construction. Sure there might be someone inside that would be willing to help us, but we haven´t managed to make contact with anyone yet"**
Making their way through the forest, the trio advances towards the city, and the location of their back entrance. The trip goes smoothly, and even though they can see the massive walls of the city tower over the treetops not at all that far from them, the thick forest provides them with adequate cover from any sentries posted on them. After about 5 minutes of walking, they comes upon a small clearing, and in the middle of it is a rather large artificial construction in the ground. While it is hard to tell until they got closer, the odds would be high indeed for it to be anything but the hatch.

### **Alicia** (2011-04-08 11:58:29)

"**Thank you,**" Jakira says to the woman's retreating form as then she too turns and heads back the way she came, following the procedures to leave the quarantined section of the ward. Passing back through the doors into the medbay, she located the computer terminal and accessed the patient records. She needed more clues as to what the disease was affecting them and she used her own medical knowledge to piece together a remedy to, if nothing else, slow down the rate it progressed.

The distance to the supposed entrance wasn't far and it was easily traversed. Thankfully the thick foliage provided them with enough cover that they could move freely. Seeing that the entrance was in a small clearing it almost seemed that it was placed there with purpose. Looking back to the city walls they were still well concealed from anyone who might be looking out from the high vantage point.
**"This almost looks planted here."** He said walking around the construction. **"We couldn't ask for a better way in. Add in the fact that its also concealed from the wall if this works out we have an excellent entry point into the city."**
He began looking for a way to open the hatch.

As she sits down at the terminal, Jakira pulls up the medical files stored in the outposts databanks. The knowledge base isn´t extensive, but it does cover a surprisingly good base. As she takes her time to examine and cross-reference patient journals and records from the local network, she notices that it seems like reports from other outposts are slowly starting to come in. Still, checking and double-checking things takes their time, and the lack of progress is slow.
As she processes through more and more of the available files, she becomes only more and more puzzled. For all she can tell, all records and values looks normal. The people with fevers have minor infections where they´re expected too, and those with deficient values of certain minerals or vitamins shows the respective corresponding deficiencies in their health. It is like they´ve all managed to just catch a whole bunch of diseases at once.

It didn´t take Wes long to find the very obvious way to open the hatch: A big grip. Unfortunately, it was equally easy to spot the big lock keeping it shut. All in all, the hatch was of a very simple design and there likely wasn´t more to it than breaking the lock and pulling on the hatch.
**"I´d stay low if I was you. My guess is that someone cleared out the forest around this hatch for the sole purpose of making it visible from the wall"**
Pulling out a small fusion cutter from a pouch on his belt, Muurak moved quickly over to the hatch and knelt by it. Engaging the cutter, he got to working on the lock as he cast a glance towards the town wall in the distance.
**"It *is*a great way in, but we still have to be careful. The troopers patrolling the walls might happen to cast a glance our way, and then we´d better not be here"**
The Togorian works fast, and it shows he has done this before, and soon he has worked through the lock. Assisting him, Tek grabs hold of the hatch and pulls hard on it. After a few seconds it budges, and opens up to show a ladder leading down into a tunnel.
**"After you ladies"**
Smiling at his reptilian companion, Muurak replaces the fusion cutter in his belt pouch and then leaps into the hole, landing after five or sex meters or so, showing surprising grace for someone of his size.

### **Yogi** (2011-04-13 21:28:56)

Wes moved around the construction keeping it between him and the those who maybe on the wall as Muurak made quick work of the lock. **"Agreed if we're spotted this way in will be useless to us. Or they'll have it ambushes set up for us the next time we come back."** In about the time it took for him to say what he said the lock had been cut and Tek had begun to open the door. Looking in it was easy to see a ladder leading down. Not one to wait the Mandalorian moved to the ladder only to have the Togorian quickly leap down. **"Showoff."** He said quietly in jest as he climbed onto the ladder and quickly made his way down till he hit bottom. Bringing up his carbine he took a look around at his surroundings.

Puzzlement and some uncertainty creep into Jakira's thoughts as she continues to reference and cross reference the varying symptoms recorded on the patient records. Setting down the datapad she had been using to compile her thoughts and references to the records, her fingers stroke across her forehead before she leans back with a sigh. It was going to be a long day she knew, and wondered whether Wes was fairing better on his mission. Most likely it wasn't riddled with mind throbbing puzzles.
Sitting up, she leaned in to the terminal and proceeded to go through the records again, making sure she didn't miss anything, but also marking down her prognosis and suggested treatment. Even if she didn't have a cure for the disease, she could treat the deficiencies, and maybe give the infected a chance to fight it or survive long enough. It was her hope that blood work and samples would provide more of the answers she wanted, but at this rate she wouldn't be surprised if they were just as puzzling.

Once the Mandalorian has gotten a way down the ladder, Tek joins him in climbing, and as he carefully closes the hatch over them, the clear illumination provided by the blue sky was replaced by a grey gloom of the underground tunnels. It wasn´t blinding dark, and there appeared to be some lighting down there, but the glow panels were dim, and all in all the place was quite dull.
With Tek safely down behind them, the trio started to move out slowly in the tunnel, the two mercenaries leaving their weapons holstered. Naturally adapted for sharper vision in the dark, Muurak took point, taking care to move at a silent pace, and making sure to check out every bend of the tunnel before passing it. From what Wes understood, the tunnel would take them closer to the city, and as it never forked so far, he could only assume they were on the right track. After about 10-15 minutes of walking though, they reached the split in the tunnel, a T-intersection that led off to the right and the left.
**"Well then, looks like we´ve finally reached the city. Too bad none of us really have any bearings on what is where inside the walls"**
Staying inside the original tunnel, the feline took a few quick steps out in the intersection and looked both ways, but pulled his head back and shook it.

### **Yogi** (2011-04-16 16:40:42)

The tunnels were pretty dark. Not enough to be blinding but enough to limit sight distance. **"I really need to get that optics package reinstalled."** He said into his comlink so that only his two companions could hear as they started walking. He was impressed with Muuraks ability to see in the low lighting and his ability to stay as quiet as possible. He wondered if the stealth was a natural ability or a trained one.
Slow and steady he followed doing his best to move as silent as possible but knowing that he could not compare to the Togorians ability. It took about a quarter hour of moving towards the city till they had a decision to make. The tunnel came to a T-Intersection and they needed to figure out what direction to head. Wes was already calming himself as Muurak stepped out and took a quick look down both directions. He sought the calmness that he always had before battle that allowed him to somehow sense things and beings he never should have been able to. He always used to believe that it was just some knack but the events of the past month had revealed otherwise. Using what the Ithorian had been trying to teach him and what he already did naturally he opened himself to the Force.
Watching Muurak give the indication that the intersection was clear he brought up an armored hand he indicated that they hold for a moment. **"Give me a few seconds."** He said through their comlinks so no one else would hear them. Opening himself up to the Force he reached out in an attempt to sense for any other presences down here in the tunnels.

As the time passes, Jakira finds herself more and more buried in similar results. Checking, double-checking and triple-checking the journals and results, the only thing she manages to find is the ingredients for a pretty severe headache for herself.
She couldn´t find anything wrong with what she was looking at, other than the odd deviation in medication, probably just due to the human factor of the medical staff. All treatments was appropriate for the ailments they were used against, and everything should be just fine.

As the headache swelled in her skull, Jakira decided she'd had enough. The medical staff had obviously already done what they could for the patients for the time being and she wasn't serving any purpose other than make it harder for her to concentrate latter. All the work she had done had made her hungry, something the small, tasteless ration packs she munched on could not satiate, and combined with the fact her abductors had interrupted her meal almost the day before and the headache,the jovial Zeltron was almost surly.
She stretched as she stood and from the tightness of her muscles she guess she had been at the workstation for a number of hours she didn't feel like calculating. Tossing her cloak over one arm and cradling the borrowed datapad, she stepped out into the hallway of the complex, the thought of food and some "fresh" air quickening her steps. Glancing up and down the hall she decided to head in the opposite way Andrea had brought her.

As he reached out with the Force, Wes searches for any hints of life in the two diverging tunnels. But the tunnels remained as empty and lifeless as they had been so far, with the only presences Wes could sense was that of his two companions, and even the signature of the massive reptilian wasn´t entirely clear.
His two companions look at him for a moment, and casts slightly confused looks at each other. When he does not provide them with any new information, Tek reaches down to pull up the knife he had stashed in his boot before. Looking at the weapon for a few moments, he replaces it in his boot and jerks his head to the right.
**"North´s that way. It´ll take us closer to the wall on the opposite side from the mining facility. They´ll likely have massed their main defenses near that wall, so if we can get up behind them that would be nice"**
Nodding in agreement, Muurak started to move again, taking the right turn, with Wes following. Tek stayed a few meters behind them both, more careful not with leaving their rear open now that they were in an area where people might actually be coming from that direction. After a few minutes of walking, and a couple of 90-degree turns, they came across a small alcove in the tunnel that contained a ladder leading up and out of the tunnels. Making a quick sprint a few meters forward to see where the tunnel continued, Muurak returned to Wes just as Tek came up to them.
**"The tunnel takes a turn not far up ahead, but I can´t say much more than that. I´d say we get up and see what we´re dealing with. Everything looks the same down here anyway"**

**Alicia**
As she walks out into the complex, Jakira passes some of the inhabitants of the settlement, most looking friendly at her, and some even stopping to offer her their gratitude for trying to help them out.
The settlement itself is rather sterile and rough, kind of what you´d expect from a mining colony like this. Walls are grey and dull, the only break in their texture being whenever a door is found, and that´s a pattern that sticks. Nowhere is any kind of decoration to be seen, no fountains, no statues, no flowers...in fact, it seems like whoever built this place got a huge discount on duracrete that he wanted to use.
As she walks down the corridor, she passes a few door on her sides. It doesn´t seem like she is in any section where people might be living though, and as she reads the signs on the doors she seems to be right in that assumption: "Mess Hall", "Administration Offices", "Shipping and Receiving"

### **Alicia** (2011-04-25 18:45:20)

Upon meeting the people, her attitude turns from sullen to being quite approachable. She had always enjoyed meeting and chatting with new people and even though her mood hadn't been the best thanks to her difficult problem at hand, it would never stop her from doing another thing she did best: interacting with others. Those who stop her she will take several moments to speak with them, learning what she can from their casual conversations what's been happening within the mining facility, how long they'd been there. It was refreshing to meet so many new people and she took advantage of it.
Getting on her way again, she walked up and then back down the hall, going into the mess hall, which had been her destination during her venture. Looking around she tries to get a sense of what food they had to offer, and considering the grey, sanitized feel of the facility itself as well as the fact they were rationing their food, she didn't expect it to be anything on par to what she was used to.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-26 17:51:25)

As she enters the mess, Jakira finds a very simple room, with tables and seating benches arranged in rows taking up most of the space. A few people are seated, offering her a nod or wave of greeting as she passes. Most are wearing the same grey uniforms that most people she´s seen is wearing, but some of them wear white coats, indicating they might be working in some different section.
As she gets deeper into the room, she spots a young man sitting surrounded by a few crates. She thinks she recognizes him as one of the people that were with Andrea and the General as they arrived, and she gets closer he greets her.
**"Hey there doc, looking for something?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-04-27 09:59:46)

The Zeltron gives the young man a smile, glad to at least see a familiar face even if she doesn't know his name. Something she hoped to remedy quickly. Drawing nearer to the man she takes another look at what he's working on and what the contents of the crates were. Taking a seat next to him she peers in. "**I was giving myself a headache and decided a walk and a break to eat was in order.**" She looks around again at the others sitting at the various tables, taking in what was on the menu and frowns slightly. "**Please tell me there is *something* edible?**"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-27 14:53:41)

**Alicia**
**"Well, at least you know where your headache comes from. Have you discovered anything new?"**
Jumping off the crate he was sitting on, the young man starts to look through another crate next to him.
**"Hmm…let´s see…most of the stuff we have that we know isn´t contaminated is military field rations. You know, not enough nutrients for any kind of plauge to survive on"**
Laughing a bit, he throws her a silver-encased ration pack. Small as they are, these things contains all a grown and healthy man needs in a day. Which means they are more than enough for Jakira. Still, as everything comes in the shape of dried and compressed nutrition blocks, tablets and pastes, it has a taste that has also been rumored to be able to fell a grown and healthy man, given enough time...
**"See that as some added incentive for getting this things sorted out quickly. The sooner you´re done, the sooner we can eat a decent meal again. And don´t you worry, I´ll throw you a real feast"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-05-02 12:55:05)

Taking the few seconds that he asked for he sensed that there was indeed nothing other than them down here in the tunnels. At least there was that running for them. It didn't mean that there could be other surprises laying in wait for them.
Nodding at Tek's information he fell in line behind the Togorian. **"Any view of their preparations might show us a weakness or provide us with a better idea on getting in side."** He spoke softly as he laid their walking path into memory. Noting turns and what markers he could make out for the return trip.
Wes saw Muurak quickly make his way past a ladder farther down the tunnel. He returned as Tek finally caught up. He looked up the ladder as Muurak talked about going topside. **"We just don't know where here is? Only one way to find out though."** He looked at his two companions. **"All three of up going up? I have a feeling that we might stand out."**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-05-02 13:07:28)

Jakira shakes her head a bit disappointed herself that she hadn't anything of worth to report concerning the disease. "**Other than being a headache inducing puzzle… I haven't learned anything which I can use to cure it from the patient records. And the staff was already on the right track in treating the symptoms so there's not much else I can do till I can analyze samples.**"
As he tosses her the ration pack she makes a face at it. It seemed all she had been eating recently were the bland, nutrient rich rations. "**Muurak and Tek owe me a decent meal,**" she says, breaking the seal. "**They could have at least waited till I had finished the first good meal I'd had in a while.**" She sniffed, knowing how trivial a single meal was in the scheme of the wellbeing of the planets infected populace. She gave the young man a small mischievous smile. "**You better be careful about offering to throw me a feast, I can eat quite a bit.**" Breaking one of the tablets into a bite size piece she again made a face as she ate it, "**Though anything at this point is better than this.**"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-03 16:46:42)

**Yogi**
**"True, but on the other hand they have a sizable garrison up there. And it´s not like we don´t stand out each on our own"**
The Togorian nudged his head in Tek´s direction.
**"I know that one has no trouble going up there on his own, but personally I´d say we stick together. Since we have no clear chain of command here, I guess the choice is yours. I´m growing tired of these tunnels though, so I´ll be taking this ladder anyway, but you can keep going on ahead. I didn´t notice any signs of opposition nearby"**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-03 16:56:03)

**Alicia**
The young man chuckled as he took a bite from a ration of his own. Chewing on the bite a bit, he swallowed hard.
**"I´d be surprised if someone of your size could match the usual order we get here. This is a mining colony, remember, and some of the guys here are pretty big on the food as well. And serving something with a decent taste doesn´t slow them down one bit"**
Looking around, he excused himself for a moment and got up to retrieve another pack from a crate, and hurled it towards another colonist approaching you. The other thanked for the meal and moved over to take a seat with some other locals. Closing up the crate again, he returned to his seat near Jakira and continued to chew on his ration.

### **Alicia** (2011-05-04 12:24:22)

The Zeltron gave the young man a conspitorial smile. "**You haven't met many of my people have you? We can generally out drink and eat the hardiest of folk. Two livers and a fast metabolism helps with that.**" She sighs as she too tears off another bite, the food may not be satisfying in any gourmet sense, but she had to admit it would keep people alive. "**Hopefully I can at least prove the other food is safe. Wouldn't want that stuff to spoil, and it has to taste better than this."**
She watches as he tosses out one of the canisters. "**You must see everyone in here at one point in the day… Thankless task passing out food which no one really wants to eat.**"

The chuckling that started as Jakira explained the internal workings of the Zeltron species turned into a small laughter as she expressed her sentiments on his position.
**"Well, I guess it´s a good thing I got to know everybody while we had some decent food to hand out. Everyone around knows the drill, so luckily I´m not held responsible for our current shortage of good stuff"**
He looked around for a while, waving to someone in the end of the room before he turned back to Jakira.
**"Have you had a chance to examine our stock supplies yet? I´d love to be able to lift peoples spirits with something nice"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-05-04 16:52:29)

Jakira shared his mirth, needing to laugh about something. With a shrug in regards to examining the supplies, she added, "**I probably wouldn't be idling here if there was work to be done. As nice as it's been to get out and chat. I'm still waiting on the samples I requested hours ago when I got here.**" It was hard to be idle knowing there was still so much to be done, but without the samples she'd probably just be going back in circles till she could actually do something productive.
"**Hopefully the samples won't take forever,**" she said glaring at the rations in her hand. "**Not sure how long I'll be able to stand these blasted things.**" She couldn't help but laugh.

**"If you want to, I can let you in to take a look at the supplies in a few minutes. Just let me get someone to cover my shift. After all, if you talked to Andrea about it, she´d just tell you to go to me anyway"**
Smiling with the last comment, the young man picks up a comlink from his belt, calling someone named Cira to come and distribute the food to those workers who had yet to come take out their meals for the shift.

I didn’t bring anything to collect the samples with.**” Waiting for him to finish and be relieved, she soon began to retrace her steps back to the medbay, provided the man doesn’t show her another way. Stepping into the place which was quickly becoming her own, she collected the needed gear and some safety equipment. It wouldn’t do after all if she contracted the disease herself.
Passing over some of it over for the young man to carry, she gave him an amused smile. “**All this time we’ve been chatting and you’ve failed to mention your name.**” Done collecting her equipment she motioned for him to lead the way to the storage room.

Wes nodded as Muurak spoke. They weren't going to find anything down here other than maybe animals living in the tunnels. What they needed to see was topside.
He took two steps to the ladder and placed a hand on a rung. **"Agreed lets go then. When topside lets try to stay within view of each other if we spread out a bit. It would give us a better chance to take notice of anything relevant to garrison strength and equipment. Any weakness we can exploit will be needed."**
He looked at the Torgorian and nodded. **"I'll go first. I might as well try and make myself useful on this trip instead of just following along."** With ease he began to ascend the ladder. As he climbed he reached out with his senses to the area beyond the access to the sewer trying to get a feeling if this was a safe point to exit from.

**Alicia**
It takes a few minutes for the young man to find someone to cover for him, but once he does, he and Jakira heads of for the infirmary. After gathering the necessary tools, as well as a breath mask, gloves, and other basic security equipment, the head off for the storage area.
The young man smiles as he picks up some of the gear Jakira gives to him as she remarks on their incomplete introductions.
**"Don´t worry, I hardly pay attention to introducing myself these days. When you work in a small place like this, you eventually get to know pretty much everyone around. But since you still appears to be interested, everyone around calls me Jackson"**
Following her newfound friend through environments similar to the ones she passed through earlier, he takes them into a small storage room that she finds to be containing a few dozen crates like the ones in the mess hall.
**"Well then, here we are"**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-18 16:18:24)

**Yogi**
Taking point up the ladder, Wes cannot sense anything waiting for them on the surface as he climbs. Reaching the top, he finds the controls to the hatch and opens it. Slipping out, he finds himself in an alleyway between two large buildings.
Waiting as his two companions comes up next to him, Wes can see no one as he looks around. Once they are out, Tek straightens his gear out and looks around.
**"So then, what now?"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-05-23 10:21:13)

Wes smiled behind his helmet at Tek's question. He looked back to the alleyways opening that was clear for the moment. **"Head out and do some recon. Try and get data on troop strengths, procedures and the way they do things in here. We also have the camera that the General gave us so any pictures that we can get to back up our findings will be all the better."** He checked his carbine making sure that it was ready to go.
**"The longer we're out there the greater the chance we're going to get discovered so lets not over stay our welcome. Take an hour to look around and then meet back near the alley entrance before leaving. This way we can see what we have and if decided we need more time we can go from there."**
He looked from Tek and then to Muurak. **"Ready to go?"**

### **Alicia** (2011-05-23 14:48:47)

Jakira smiles at Jackson at the introduction. "**I know how it is… The hospital I established on Solsis became a close knit community of it's own, and since we rarely got much space traffic everyone got to know each other. Even members of other villages.**" She grows quiet for a moment as the memory of her beloved hospital being bombarded to ruins came to mind. It was unlikely that even the foundations of the temple had survived Sith "justice". "**They're all gone now,**" she said with a sad finality. Even the small group who had escaped its destruction with her had probably been hunted down and either outright killed or put to work.
Her focus changes as they reach the store room and a newfound determination sets her mind to another matter. After all it wouldn't do for her to focus on the past, there wasn't anything she could do for those she had befriended. Glancing over the crates, she puts on the protection before approaching one of them, her sample kit in hand. Looking for crates with more perishable foods, she sets out to collect samples to test them first, asking Jackson for his help in moving them when needed. "**How long have you been here?**" she asks conversationally, marking the first of many samples to identify it more easily later.

**Yogi**
The Dashade and Togorian shoots each other a look and then nods back to Wes. Taking the lead, the feline moves out of the alleyway, takes a few moments to look around, and then vanishes to the left. Giving him a few moments to get away, Tek disappears in a similar manner to the right, leaving Wes all alone.
((Really sorry of you feel this was lame, but there wasn´t a setup for anything more interesting))

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-29 16:56:52)

**Alicia**
Jackson follows suite and assists Jakira with what she needs while listening to her story. Shaking his head, he looks at her with sympathy.
**"Sorry to hear that, but right now the Galaxy is a dark place. Not much hope left anywhere if you ask me"**
Continuing to work in silence, he seems a bit taken off guard by the question she asked him.
**"Oh my, now that´s a question. I suppose you won´t be surprised if I tell you that you tend to lose track of time in a place like this. It feels like I´ve been here forever, though in reality it just below 8 years now"**

### **Yogi** (2011-06-01 13:05:37)

Wes watches as Tek and Muurack give him a nod and then move out. He liked how these two worked. Strictly business when the situation called for it. Before moving off with the two he secured the entrance to the sewers to make it look like it hadn't been disturbed but would open easily if the need should arise. If it did then they screwed up and had been found out.
He was half way to the alley entrance when Tek made his way out. He waited another moment before looking out. Not seeing either of the other two or anyone else who may be looking he composed himself and left the alley entrance. Standing tall he walked like he belonged there taking a different path then the other two.

### **Alicia** (2011-06-01 16:51:38)

Jakira nods as he tries to count how long he had been here. Adjusting the protective mask, she moves efficiently through the crates collecting her samples. She's unaware of time passing as she doesn't say much else, concentrating on the task at hand and reminiscing her own experiences. When the task is done, she closes everything up before disinfecting everything they had touched and used in the process of removing the protective equipment. She wasn't intending on taking any chances.
Everything in order she gives Jackson a smile. "**Thanks for your help. If you don't have other duties I could use some assistance in prepping the samples.**"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-06-04 14:51:18)

**Yogi**
Closing the sewer entrance, Wes waited for his Reptilian companion to vanish from view before heading out on his own. It appeared they had surfaced in a rather remote and scarcely populated part of the city, as the only people he passed were the odd pair of stormtroopers, and a small group of militia soldiers. The stormtroopers shot him a couple of looks, but they appeared content to take him for just a hired merc, or just someone who happened to be in the city.
The buildings he found in the block he walked though were mainly warehouses and storage facilities as it seemed, though they were unlabeled and unmarked, so what was inside was anyones guess.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-06-04 15:03:52)

**Alicia**
**"I´d love to stay and help, but I´m afraid I have some things to tend to elsewhere. The General wanted me to go outside and see if I could find some fresh fruit or berries to widen our supplies. But good luck in fixing this mess for us"**
Smiling, the young man leaves Jakira to her own work with the samples of the food. Time doesn´t exactly fly, and she is actually a bit surprised to see that it has only been two hours when she is finally done. As she begins to pack up, her comlink starts to beep, Andrea calling.
((Just as a reminder in case you had forgotten, you are still in a Skill Challenge))

---

### **Alicia** (2011-06-04 16:05:09)

Jakira gives the young man a smile of thanks, needing all the well-wishing she could get, and watched sadly as he left her to the work. "**At least if you do we'll have something with taste to ease those rations,**" she says to his retreating back. Packing up, she's only slightly surprised to be getting a transmission from Andrea, who she didn't recall giving her comm frequency to. Fumbling for a moment, she withdraws the beeping device and turns it on before setting it beside her to finish packing up her gear. "**Jakira.**"
(( I know. ))

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-06-08 17:35:58)

**Alicia**
It takes a few moments for Andrea´s voice to come out of the small communications device. Even over the comlink, she can hear that the other woman is clearly troubled by something.
**"Hey Jakira, it´s me. I need to talk to you. Now. Can you meet me at the landing platform in ten minutes?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-06-08 18:47:51)

Jakira stops in the middle of her packing and tries to determine where she is and how to get back to the landing platform in the maze of corridors. "**I'll be there as soon as I can,**" she says, and troubled by Andrea's tone she increases her pace, packing up her things as quickly as possible and then sets a brisk pace to her destination. *I hope it's not a medical problem. I don't have my medical kit on me.* With a breathless sigh, she curses her own unequipped state. She arrives at the platform a bit breathless, the kit of samples still clutched under her arm. Taking a look around, she tries to spot Andrea before heading over to her.

### **Yogi** (2011-06-15 08:08:50)

Wes took not of the warehouses that he passed. Depending on what they were used for they might make a good staging point for when they make a play for the city. If he had a security kit he could easily see if the warehouses were locked up and bypass the systems in place to protect them. Still it didn't prevent him from looking around.
Keeping an eye out for anymore troopers or militia he made his way along one of the warehouses in an attempt to see inside the building taking pictures when possible. Looking around he headed in a direction that he figured would take him to a more populated area keeping track of way-points to make his way back when the time required it.
Looking at his chrono he checked his time.

**Alicia**
After a few moments of looking around, Jakira spots Andrea standing off to the side. She is standing with General Wann, talking about something. As the Zeltron medic approaches them the woman turns to her, and noticing the bag under Jakira´s arm, smiles.
**"Ah, glad to see you could make it. How´s the investigation coming?"**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-05 19:26:28)

**Yogi**
Lacking the proper equipment to bypass the security that was in fact in place on the warehouses he passed, Wes is limited to only try and look inside them. Many of the buildings are simply bland, cubical, durasteel buildings sporting only a few windows near the roofs and sometimes even that. Some manages to give a better idea of what they are used for, sporting labels of various companies, and thus likely containing products related to the branches those companies deal in. Nothing very interesting catches his eye however, as the companies are mostly the ones dealing in home electronics, low-degree droid manufacturing and similar things.
Coming across another building, he decides to take a closer look. After a quick check to see that no militia forces were about, he starts to walk along the building, trying to get a good look inside. He fails to catch much through the windows though, as most of them only leads into some kind of entry hall and not to the cargo area itself. Reaching the end though, he notices an alleyway similar to the one the had exited to sewers from.
Walking down the alleyway, he finds a stack of garbage crates stuffed outside, and a small window, probably used for ventilation located conveniently near the top of the stack. Climbing up, he peeks inside and tries to get some good picures of what´s inside. He spots several stacks of crates similar to the ones he is standing on, and while most are covered in wrappings, he manages to spot a logo with some sort of company name. "VirDev". Looking around more, he notices that much of the things inside is wrapped up, but it looks like several tables of some sort are lined up in the middle of the room, with some kind of gear standing under the wrappings. He also notices several large cylinders lining the walls, probably containing some kind of fluid.

---

### **Alicia** (2011-07-06 21:33:37)

Jakira is tempted to allow her annoyance to take root, but instead she takes the situation. After all there has to be a reason they up and call her here when she has a great deal of work to do. "**Still working out the pieces,**" she says obliquely, adjusting the case of samples under her arm as she looks between the general and Andrea. "**If you don't mind I have a great deal of work to do.**" She raises an eyebrow in question, wanting them to get to the point of the summons.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-07-07 12:20:44)

Standing atop the crates Wes took stock of what he could see. It wasn't much to look at. Several stacks of covered crates like the ones he was standing on were easily seen. One stack wasn't covered as well as the others revealing a name on the side. Quickly he took several pictures of the interior covering the crates, table and the large cylinders. Looking again at the crates with the nave "VirDev" he rolled the name over in his head trying to find any recollection but came up with nothing. Though what he didn't know his companions might.
Looking to his sides for any militia forces he descended the crates with ease and made his way back to the alley entrance noting any landmarks so he could easily find the building again. Not wanting to press his luck in the back alley ways he looked for a way to a more open area where he wouldn't bring as much suspicion.
As he walked he checked his time wondering how Tek and Muurak were doing.

Checking his time, Wes saw that it had been about three quarters of an hour since he had split up from his companions. As he walked out of the alley, he could spot a patrol of stormtroopers further down the road on his right, though at the distance it seemed unlikely if they had even noticed him, and had it not been for their distinctive white armor he might not have taken notice of them either.
Making his way towards more open areas, he had to leave the blocks closest to the outer city wall and instead head deeper into the city. As he did so, he found the number of people increasing, as well as the number of looks he was shot. Still, he didn´t feel any reason to be alarmed. A Mandalorian wasn´t exactly a usual sight, and people living in a blockaded and fortified city like this likely cast anyone who was armed or armored a glance.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-11 11:23:55)

**Alicia**
Both Andrea and the General seemed at once a bit less cheerful, and the question about Jakiras progress had obviously just been asked to open the conversation. Taking a look around, the General turned back to her.
**"We´re sorry to call you out of your investigation like this, but we have received new we thought you might want to know, and we didn´t want to take it over the comm. We have received word from allies that a familiar ship has been seen entering that capital"**
Clearing her throat, Andrea continued.
**"The ship belongs to Lord Devon, the man placed in charge of the Imperial operations on the planet. Devon…is a Sith"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-07-11 12:26:26)

"**I see**," Jakira says calmly through the practice of keeping cool on the job. A doctor, after all, who panicked usually made things worse. Her calm demeanor, however, was betrayed by the lightening of her skin as she grew paler. It was entirely possible this Devon didn't know they were here per say, and just came back to continue his role as Governor or what ever it was he did here. Though she was likely to draw some attention if word of her arrival here at reached him. Being a doctor for an opposing front they were using a disease to annihilate wasn't exactly in her favor.
Clearing her throat, she asks "**Has there been any word from them?**" She hoped they knew who she meant, though there was now only one person she was worried for. Wes didn't know and he was now in the city with the Sith monster. That was probably the worst part of it all.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-07-11 12:26:54)

Seeing that he had roughly 15 minutes left didn't leave much time for him to do much else. Still he wanted to get more of a look at the city proper even if it was only for a quick glance. Moving along he was surprised to spot a squad of storm troopers way down the road on his right. If it hadn't been for their armor he might have missed them. Keeping a quick pace he made sure to be out of sight heading down another alley towards the city proper.
After a few minutes and several stares he found himself in a more populated area. It mostly seemed to be civilians as he hadn't spotted any other troopers or mercs in the area. Ignoring the the looks he drew, which was common, he continued on to where he would find another alley to lead him back to where he would regroup with his two companions. He knew better than to over stay his welcome. He made sure to get as many views as he could taking note of anything that would prove useful when they finally assaulted the city. He also looked to the sky several times to see if he could see and aerial traffic that might indicate a hanger. He hadn't found the hanger or a vehicle garage of any sort but hoped that the other two might have had more luck then he had.
When the time came to take to the alley again he moved with purpose checking his chrono again. He was cutting it close and might even be a bit late. Keeping a eye out both ahead and behind him he moved on to the rendezvous point at the sewer opening.

Both the man and woman shook their heads.
**"We´ve been keeping it silent since they went in, and I suspect they won´t report back until they are out of there. And if we try to contact them, we´ll only increase whatever danger they might already be in. Besides, I´m sure they´ve taken caution not to be seen by the wrong people"**
The General sounded pretty certain that none of them were in any real danger.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-12 12:20:01)

**Yogi**
As Wes made his way back towards the rendezvous point he noticed a squad of stormtroopers making their way along one of the streets in the lesser populated area if the city, though they were walking away from him and at a distance, and none of them seemed to notice him. He made it back to the sewer entrance without incident, and pretty soon the towering form of Muurak dropped down from the ceiling above him, giving the Mandalorian a quick nod.
**"So, you made it in time then. Find anything good?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-07-12 19:42:10)

With a nod Jakira takes their words into consideration, though she has to admit it isn't the staying unseen part which makes her nervous. "**Thanks for the news… If there's nothing else, I should get back to work. I'm hoping if I can isolate how the contagion was introduced then it may lead to clues to curing it. If nothing else, I can eliminate the food as a carrier and have something better than those blasted field rations to eat.**" While she hadn't had much luck yet in isolating an exact treatment, the two at least deserved an update on her activities.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-07-13 08:17:25)

Dropping down through the sewer entrance Wes moved off to the side taking a position to cover the entrance point allowing anyone who might be following them access down. Hopefully it would only be his two traveling companions. It wasn't long before the heard the sewer grate move and the big form of Muurak dropped down through the opening. Relaxing his guard a bit he returned the nod to the big alien and answered his question.
**"Well that depends on what is classified as good. I didn't find the hanger or vehicle garage like the General was wanting so I'm hoping that either you or Tek found it. I did managed to get a good look inside a warehouse and take some pictures. Does the name VirDev mean anything to you? Is was marking crates in the warehouse. Also several large cylinders full of liquid. Not sure what type though."**
He looked back to the entrance. **"They are patrolling the alleyways though. I ran into a militia patrol that paid me no attention probably because I look like I fit in. There were two roving storm trooper patrols that I spotted. If they are patrolling the alley ways it will make our job here in the future that much harder."** He paused for a moment. **"Did you find anything?"**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-18 09:28:32)

**Alicia**
**"Well, that would be quite welcome news I´m certain. Even an old dog like me tires of these rations eventually. We´ll keep you informed if anything arises. Now if you ladies will excuse me, I have some things to attend to"**
As the General walks away, Andrea turns to Jakira.
**"As always, just contact me if you need anything. I have spoken with some people from the other outposts, have the sample data been transferred yet?"**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-18 09:36:41)

**Yogi**
The Togorian takes a moment to think, but shakes his head.
**"Doesn´t ring a bell, no. Maybe someone back at base knows it"**
He looks up at the sewer entrance, and then back at Wes.
**"Actually, the patrols in the alleyways might work to our advantage. If we move quickly during the assault, we can hopefully catch a number of them out in the open, before they can barricade themselves. We don´t really have the gear with us for a heavy siege, that´s the whole reason we´re out here. I worked from the rooftops to try and get a better view of this city section, and the fact is it doesn´t seem like they have many fortifications or reinforcement points at all in this section. I suppose they consider the patrols to be enough"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-07-20 08:59:59)

Wes nodded as Tem spoke of the the lack of fortifications in this part of the city. It was certainly a possibility that that was the case.
**"It's possible then that the rest of the city may be the same way. Maybe the exterior wall has given a false sense of security and defense points were thought of as overkill."** He shrugged his armored shoulders as he finished. **"I guess we won't know till your partner gets back."**
Wes looked up to the hatch as the Togorian did a moment ago and then checked his chrono. **"He doesn't have a habit of being late does he?"**
Despite asking the question he had a feeling that he already knew the answer.

**"We´ve seen some defensive emplacements on the outer wall, but if the rest of the city is indeed this lazily fortified, it will help us a lot"**
The Togorian turned a grimacing face towards the sewer entry, and placed a hand on the ladder.
**"Not when he´s on duty, no, but you never really know about that one. I´ll take a look"**
But just as the feline places his foot on the ladder as well, both of you can hear the sound of blasterfire coming from above, and not in a small amount either. A few seconds later, the light coming from the open entrance darkens as a massive shape comes crashing down, seemingly diving head-first into the hole, missing Wes by a close distance as he crashes down.

### **Alicia** (2011-07-23 18:53:58)

Jakira nods, suddenly weary. She hadn't gotten anywhere with the information she had been siphoning through, just more puzzles and a headache. "**Yes. All the reports are pointing to the same thing, though I've yet to figure out what exactly that is.**" She sighs heavily, mostly in frustration. "**I'm hoping the cell samples will provide a better understanding of how the contagion works.**"
With the kit still clutched under one arm, she turns and waves her free hand in a terse goodbye. "**I'll let you know if I need anything else.**" She starts to head toward the medbay, wanting to get the next task done and over with to mull over the puzzle. At least all the walking she had done had allowed her to ease the stiff muscles she had been getting hunching over her notes and the computer displays and given her a break from the mind boggling puzzle they had thrown at her.
Once back in the lab she gets to work prepping the samples of food to be analyzed, taking the time for the necessary precautions.

### **Yogi** (2011-07-29 10:55:08)

When Wes heard that Muurak was generally "on time" he began to wonder about the feline. He watched as Tek placed a reptilian foot on the ladder. At that second blaster fire was heard coming from above. Bringing his carbine up as Tek threw open the hatch the massive form of their other companion came hurtling down the opening. Moving to the side quickly Wes managed to not be buried by the big mercenary.
**"I think he found something."** He said in a matter of fact tone as he took a knee to see to Muurak. **"Do we have any way to lock that to slow them down"** Not waiting for an answer from Tek he placed a hand on Muurak who had landed in a heap. **"Are you able to move big guy? I think the friends you brought with you aren't the ones we want at this little party."**

Back in the lab, Jakira settles down, preparing the food samples for analysis. More reports and sample data have been sent in from the other outposts for her to take a look at as well if she wants to. On occasion, someone stops by to get something from the lab, casually asking her how the work was going and maybe offering a little chat, but most the time, she just finds herself working alone in silence.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-29 19:50:13)

**Yogi**
With minimal help, the massive reptilian gets up on his feet, and if he had been hurt by the fall, it didn´t show. Brushing some dust off himself and correcting some gear thrown aside in the fall, he takes a look up the hatch and shakes his head.
**"You know, that´s what I told them, but it´s like they don´t want to listen"**
Seemingly okay, he pushed Wes towards the tunnel they had used to come in.
**"Those hatches were made to lock from the outside only, so I suggest we move it. Come on furball, let´s go"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-08-02 10:58:13)

**"Yeah even during the war they always wanted to get in on the party."** Wes said with a laugh as he started moving back down the tunnel. It was too bad that the hatch couldn't be locked from down here so they would just have to make do and withdraw as quickly as possible. The armored Mandalorian quickly got up to speed but was hampered a bit by his armor.
As he expected he saw his two companions easily keep pace with him. His hope, however unlikely, was that the Imperials would not be as fast.

With Muurak following in the rear, the trio made a hasty retreat down the tunnel they had used for entry. Not a moment too soon it would seem, as a metallic, clanking sound resonated behind them. Seconds later, a rippling shockwave ran through the tunnel behind them, tearing paint from the walls and sending duracrete dust flying everywhere. For anyone who cared to look back, the massive Togorians fur rippled, and Wes could even feel a slight ripple through his thick armor.

The day turns to night for Jakira as she works in the lab, and pretty soon she is given a call by Andrea that tells her quarters have been arranged for her. After wrapping up her work for the night, she decides there is nothing more she can do than catch what sleep she can.
Running like hell through the underground tunnels, Wes and his companions manages to make it out and to their speeders in amazing time. While they could still hear their pursuers behind them as they ran, they would never catch a glimpse of them. Once outside, Tek and Muurak throws the speeders in high gear and speeds off in a direction far from where they had come, in order to throw off any pursuit. Their maneuver seems to have worked, but it takes them far enough off course that they decides to spend the night in the wilds.
=============================================================================================
As the next day breaks, Jakira is woken by another comm call from Andrea, telling her that the three scouts had returned.
((I know you´re both having some things going on, but I just figured I should move this on anyway, get you a new start for when you get back. And Yogi, welcome to the skill challenge. Maybe something you guys found in your trip can be helpful...))

Having eluded the Stormtroopers, spending the night in the forest Wes was in a rather good mood when the trio finally made their way back to the rebel encampment. Confident that they hadn't been followed the three left early in the morning.
When Muurak finally turned off the speeder bike in the hanger Wes patted him on the shoulder as he got off the bike and stretched his legs a bit relishing the feeling that was coming back to them. **"Finally."** He said as he broke the seal on his helmet and lifted it up over his head. **"Where do you think the General will be? I'm sure he'll want to hear what we have to say. Though I have a feeling that he already knows we're arrived back."** He looked back to the hangers exit that led further into the mountain. He wondered where Jakira was and if she was working on the bio weapon. It would be hard to find her all he had to do was reach out to her with the Force and let the Force guide him. He held himself in check though. They had just returned from a recon mission and they haven't reported in yet.
***After wards I'll go find her and give her that kiss I promised.*** He thought a a smile came to his face.

The Togorian powered down the speeder and activated its security systems before getting off it, and as he did so Tek walked up to the pair. The Barabel waved his hand towards a few low crates standing about in the hangar and took a seat on one of them.
**"He probably knows, yeah, and if I´m guessing correctly is already on his way here. Doesn´t seem to need sleep that man. What about your girl, she usually up early?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-09-07 11:37:19)

It was a long night and thoughts rage through the Zeltron doctor’s mind preventing her from finding what could very well be needed rest. At last hours before dawn she manages to fall asleep only to be woken up by her comm. After thanking Andrea for the news, Jakira lays on the bed for a moment the relief coursing through her. She knew it had been silly to worry, Wes could of course take care himself and Devon wouldn’t be the first Sith he would have to deal with nor the last.
Feeling strangely invigorated, she clamors out of the bed and after pulling on her boots rushes out the door. Mentally she chides herself, her pace slowing to something more casual. Nodding to those she passes in the hall, her attention remains focused on not losing her way in the twist of corridors.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-09-07 12:23:48)

Wes nodded at Tek's words. **"I had that feeling about the General. He seems to be one to keep abrest of all that is going on. As for Jakira she can be an early riser I the need is there. I have a feeling that she's not getting much rest while working on a fix for the bioweapon. Like myself she can be very determined person."**.
He took his helmet and grabbed the edge with his left hand as he looked in be direction that others would enter the hanger. He was hoping not only to see the General so they could present their findings but Jakira also so that she would know he had returned.

It takes only a couple of minutes before General Wann enters the hangar, and the trio of scouts can see a look of relief on his face, most likely evicted both by seeing them return safely, and because he hopes to gain some more insight into a situation he has previously known too little about. Dressed up in his ever-present and battered armor, he greets Tek, Muurak and Wes before starting his inquiry.
**"Good to see you back in one piece. I trust you didn´t run into too many complications? Why don´t you give me the quick rundown on what you have to report, and then you can explain it more in detail once the rest of the people gets up and manages to haul themselves to the briefing room"**
====================================================================================
After navigating through the corridors in the outpost - which, despite their near-identical outlooks, she is starting to get the hang of - Jakira finally makes her way to the hangar, where she spots he General already at work debriefing the returning scouts.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-09-19 14:48:11)

Wes nodded at the Generals words. It was still early for most to be up. He was beginning to wonder if the man slept.
**"Well General we were able to gain access to the cities underground tunnels from outside and to the city streets from a manhole access. From there the three of us split up. I managed to check out some warehouses from the outside looking in. I don't have a slicers tool kit on me. So I wasn't able to gain access to the buildings themselves. I did managed to get pictures of what I was able to see. Maybe something in them will help. Tek an Muurak can go into detail on what they found. One thing, we won't be able to get back in the same way. We were discovered on the way out."**

### **Alicia** (2011-09-21 12:42:01)

Not wanting to interrupt the general’s meeting, Jakira begins to slowly make her way toward the group, schooling her expression on the way to hide her barely contained happiness. With a nod of greeting to Tek and Muurak she resists the urge to jump the Mandalorian, knowing it would likely embarrass him with Tek, Murrak, and the General standing nearby as witnesses.
She listens to the last of Wes’s rundown using it as a distraction.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-09-22 08:56:56)

**"Well, I´ll talk things over with them and see what we can come up with. We´ll assemble in the briefing room in about an hour or so to review our new information. We received some disturbing news while you were out, but we´ll take it then. At the moment, I think you have something else to keep you occupied"**
Chuckling, the man patted Wes on the shoulder and waved for his two officers to follow him. As if reading Jakira´s thoughts he smiled as he passed her.
**"Come on boys, I sense a display of affection coming up. Let´s not embarrass them more than necessary"**
Smiling, the two soldiers followed their leader out of the hangar, leaving the Zeltron doctor and the Mandalorian warrior alone.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-09-22 10:52:14)

Wes nodded when the General mentioned bad news and meeting in the briefing room in an hour. When he mentioned about something else keeping him occupied the Mandalorian smiled as he felt the pat on his shoulder. With ease he reached out with the Force and felt the welcomed presence of Jakira.
**"In an hour then General. It will give me some time to clean up."** He said with a relative calm as he turned around to face his love. With a smile on his face he closed the distance quickly to her. His helmet clanged on the hard floor as he carefully embraced her with both arms. Not carring who saw them he gave her the kiss he promised he'd give her when he returned.
Moments later when he broke the kiss he was smiling. **"I missed you. And I even returned with no injuries. Though having you fix me up would have been nice."** The last he said teasingly.

### **Alicia** (2011-09-22 12:56:30)

Jakira returns the smiles, though her attention is focused entirely on Wes. She welcomed his comforting touch through the Force, savoring the contact. Unsure whether she had taken steps toward him, she barely jumped as the helmet made a loud clang as it dropped and then she was held in his arms. In that moment all her worries and concerns were gone and she just was. When the kiss broke, she reached up to stroke a softened hard line of his features as he made his joke. "**We have an hour, there's time to make sure,**" she teases back.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-09-22 13:16:44)

Wes loosened his hold on her as he didn't want to crush her against his armor. While protective it seemed to get in the way. Though having it taken off was half the fun lately. His eyes shined at her suggestive comment as he looked into her eyes. If anything in the galaxy felt right it was this moment. They had been together for a a couple of months without being apart. Being away from her for a day and a half seemed more like a month. **"That's an offer I would be foolish to turn down."** He leaned back in to give her a quick kiss before letting go and retrieving his helmet.
He made his way back to her side and held his arm out for her. He waited for her to lead him to their quarters. **"So where do they have us bunking down and more importantly how has your research been going? Have you had as much excitement as I have?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-09-22 17:01:29)

Jakira can't help but laugh, and after waiting for him to grab his equipment she casually takes his arm. Leading him toward the quarters assigned to her, she frowns and heaves a heavy sigh at his questions. "**Not well. So far it's been headache inducing. It's like they've contracted several diseases at once and it's overloading their bodies.**" Waving obliquely in the direction of the ward she adds, "**I've done what I can to make those infected comfortable for the time being, though I have to admit the staff already had that covered.**"

---

### **Yogi** (2011-09-22 18:09:34)

Wes listened as she talked looking ahead and at her when he could. He could tell by her expression that she was frustrated with the task of figuring it out. He turned a corner when she indicated which way to turn. **"Sounds like the staff here is at least decent then. At least you have that working for you. I just hope that what information we were able to bring back will help."** He turned his head and looked at her. **"I'll help anyway I can."** The tone in his voice was suggested that he was serious in his offer of help then a small smile appeared. **"Then again my medical knowledge is about as much as your tactical knowledge. Together though I think we can get through anything."** He was happy to be back and his eyes showed it.

---

### **Alicia** (2011-09-22 23:55:55)

Retracing her steps back was a bit easier, and with subtle indications to the way she kept pace with her companion. Giving him a smile the Zeltron nods. "**I think having someone I can vent and bounce ideas off of will be a big help if you're up to the task.**" Stopping in front of a door, she presses the button for it to open and leads the way inside disengaging herself from the Mandalorian's side. Moving into the middle of the room, she turns and waits for Wes to enter and the door to close behind him. Facing him, she puts her hand on her hip and leans to the side with a small, teasing pout.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-09-23 13:04:30)

Walking with her reminded him of the times not so long ago when they were left behind by the pirate Kurr. They had been inseparable then. He was enjoying the walk and looked at her again when she finished talking about having some help. Wes nodded his head to her question. **"Anything you need cyar'ika. All you have to do is ask."** Looking ahead he found that they had stopped at a door. With the press of a button Jakira was opening the door and stepping through. For a couple steps he watched her body move before stepping through. Looking for the controls he mads sure the door closed behind him and set his helmet down on the floor.
Standing straight and looking to the center of the room he saw Jakira standing, almost posing, looking at him. The small teasing pout on her face brought a smile to his own as he took the steps required to stand before her. His arms encircled her as his left hand passed through the opening her arm created as his hands came together at the small of her back. The difference in their height caused him to look down at her face as he pulled her close. It was then he wished he didn't have his armor on so he could have felt her body against his. **"I know this may sound…"** He searched for a word he rarely used. **"Silly, but even though it's only been maybe forty hours since we've last seen each other it feels much longer."** His voice was low as an armored finger traced a circle against her lower back

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-09-27 16:47:30)

What happens in the ward is anyones guess, but approximately one hour later, Jakira and Wes arrives at the briefing room. Being of pretty standard design, the room contains a large round table, with a holoprojector in the center. Around the table they notice some familiar faces, including Andrea as well as General Wann and his two officers. With a few more chairs around being empty, they can draw the conclusion that they are not the last ones to arrive.
As they enter the room, they are greeted by the General.
**"Ah, our two new recruits, welcome. Please, take a seat. Hopefully the rest of those summoned will be up in a minute so we can get this meeting underway"**
((I didn´t get any OOC comment that you were done, but since there had been no activity in a few days, I figured I should move it on anyway))

---

### **Alicia** (2011-09-27 18:05:46)

Back in high spirits, Jakira walks into the briefing room at Wes's side. Taking in the sparse but functional room she moves toward the free chairs taking the General's invitation. Gracefully sliding into one of the chairs the young Zeltron doctor glances at the tables occupants with a nod of greeting. Everyone she expected to be in attendance was here and she wonders briefly who she hasn't met that would be showing.
Overall Jakira hopes the meeting wasn't going to take to long.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-09-29 18:28:07)

As Wes and Jakira sits down, they wait a few more minutes for a couple of more people to drop in and fill the remaining chairs. Jakira recognizes the face of the young man she met the other day, Jackson, as he smiles at her and takes a seat. Apparently satisfied with the attendance, the General speaks.
**"All right, let´s get this underway before someone falls asleep on the table. I have gathered you here because we have some disturbing news to take a stance on. As some of you may already know, we´ve received word that Lord Devon have returned to the capital. And from what it appears he brought with him some reinforcements. Now the only conclusion I can draw from this is that the Empire have grown tired of waiting for their bioweapon to wear us down, and are prepared to do things the old fashioned way. Luckily for us, that happens to be the specialty of my boys"**
He goes quiet for a moment, looking around for questions or other input.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-09-30 12:30:38)

Wes sat next to Jakira at the table. As he placed his helmet in front of him he looked around the table giving a nod to the Tek and Muurak and the others. It wasn't long till the remaining joined them and the General got things moving.
Listening to the Generals words and the mentioning of Lord Devon Wes turned his head and looked at Jakira as a hollow feeling took hold in his stomach as his hand clenched into a fist. the look in his eyes said enough. ***Another Sith here? Why can't it be like it was? No Sith running around and if there was it was only one or two. It seems like we can't go anywhere without running into one.*** He thought as his eyes looked into Jakira's.
Turning his head to look back at the General, Wes addressed him. **"General, this Lord Devon you speak of is a Sith I'm assuming."**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-10-01 18:27:33)

The General simple returned Wes´s look with a nod.
**"Yes. It is an unfortunate development, but we have to live with it. What is more important, however, is that the arrival of Devon and his reinforcements is forcing us into action. In order to seize the initiative in the inevitable confrontation that will come soon, we will take action tonight"**
Gasps of surprise went through the room, mainly from the civilian staff members, but the General remained calm and as he pressed a button on a datapad, a holographic image of the capital showed in the center of the table.
**"I know this may sound like a rash move, but the way I see it we are about to lose whatever advantages we had in terms of superior troop experience and skill. And since our recon team was so unfortunately discovered during their mission, we will soon lose out ability to penetrate their outer walls undetected, and then we are placed at a severe disadvantage"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-10-03 12:29:18)

Wes raised an eyebrow as the civilians acted with surprise as the General declared that action needed to be taken tonight and not later. It made sense really. Since they had been discovered access into the city from the same means would be difficult if they waited any longer. Tonight they might be able to find another access tunnel to get them inside.
The real problem was the Sith.
There were ways to fight them. Grenades, sonic weapons, another force user like a Jedi or one the Imperial Knights. The first two the General most likely has. The last two Wes was pretty sure he didn't. The closest thing was himself who had barely any training and a lightsaber that he only acquired about two months ago.
**"General. You sound very confident of your forces and of that I have no doubt having just worked with two of them. It seems like the real problem will be with the Sith."** He paused for a moment as he looked at Jakira for a couple of seconds. **"We've had an unfortunate meeting with one recently and they can be quite persistent and effective at ruining one's plans."** He didn't say anymore as he remembered the days spent on Solsis and how after that first night all hell broke loose and they were on the run.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-10-05 21:57:53)

A little surprising, Wes comment made the General laugh a bit.
**"I won´t argue with you there, and things did seem simpler when there weren´t so many of them running around everywhere. The upside to that, however, is that you get plenty of chances to learn how to deal with them. I think we´ve go that covered"**
Turning back towards the hologram, the old man continues.
**"As for the plan, we will use the maintenance tunnels to get access to the city. While our scouting party was exposed, they are still our best way in, and if we´re lucky, the Imperials might not even have noticed the tunnels branch out into the wilderness, but have thought our team was operating from inside the city. However, a large group will still be risky. Therefore, we will send in a small team in advance who will secure at least two entry points inside the city, including the one our team used previously since it seems the back section were not heavily guarded. Once they are clear, the rest of our forces will enter the tunnels in two team, each reinforcing a separate advance team"**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-10-09 20:12:00)

With no questions or objection raised, the General continued.
**"I will lead one of the teams, and try to secure any anti-air defenses and other key locations. The second team must secure the hangars and make sure that we are ready to respond in kind if an aerial assault comes. With their leader down on the ground, they Imperials might be thinking twice about using orbital bombardment against the city, but we must be ready just in case. We will leave some personnel here to assist with the craft we have here if it becomes necessary"**
He turns his head towards Tek and Muurak.
**"I want you two in charge of the advance teams. Take a couple of soldiers with you and make sure that we have two safe entry points. You have been around long enough to know what to do without me telling you, so unless anyone have any questions, this meeting is dismissed. Wes, Jakira, I´d have a word with you, if you please"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-10-10 12:16:28)

Having nothing to add Wes continued listening as the General laid out the plan for attacking the city. It was risky, as any attack plan was, but it sounded thought out. Hoping that the Imperials wouldn't bombard the city with the Sith on the ground was a chance but it was one worth taking. Sith or not one felt a certain sense of preservation for one's life.
With the meeting wrapped up and the jobs laid out Wes was a bit surprised that they hadn't been mentioned. The surprise was short lived when he asked to have a word with them. With a nod to the General Wes remained seated where he was as the others filed out of the conference room. When the last had left Wes looked at the armored man. **"You wanted to speak with us General."**

---

### **Alicia** (2011-10-10 12:26:52)

Jakira half listened to the briefing going on around her. It was nice being kept in the loop, but she felt the military proceedings really had nothing to do with her. Other things needed her attention, and It wasn’t like she would be any good in the fight. Her battlefield was in the ward assisting with the disease which had ultimately brought her here. With her mind wandering back to the lab and the problem of the disease, her attention was suddenly diverted back when her name was spoken by the general.
Realizing the meeting had been dismissed and he wanted she and Wes to stay, she waits for the others to disperse from the meeting room remaining in her seat next to Wes. Her head nods in agreement when Wes voices her own thoughts. *What in the world does he want to talk to us about together?*

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-10-10 21:44:46)

Taking the two aside, General Wann adjusted a piece of his armor before he started to talk.
**"Since the two of you are not part of my crew, I can´t command you around like I can most people here. Thus it is up to you what your role in tonights battle will be. While I would greatly appreciate any help I can get, I understand if you want to sit this one out. I have faith in that my men will be able to handle this on their own, but having another gun and a medic on the front never hurt anyone. Especially the medic part, my boys usually just shoot each other full of stims and keep going, which might win a battle or two, but usually keeps them off duty for a while afterwards"**
Laughing a bit, the old man returned to his more serious face.
**"Anyway, I guess what I´m saying is that this really isn´t your fight, and I won´t force you into it against your will"**

---

### **Yogi** (2011-10-13 08:21:32)

Wes joined Jakira as the General pulled them aside. The Mandalorian listened as the General talked about them not being under his command and that it was up to them if they wanted to be a part of this fight in the city. Considering the odds the older man was right. They were going to need all the help they can get on this endeavor.
Wes looked at Jakira his eyes falling into hers. He didn't even have to voice his decision as he felt that his eyes already revealed his intentions. Looking back at the General Wes nodded. **"Count me in General but I can't speak for Jakira. There is something you should know before this battle starts since there is now a Sith involved."** He took a breath and looks at Jakira quickly before looking back to the man. **"You remember how we mentioned wanting to find the remaining GA fleet."** He paused for a second and saw the man nod. He lowered his voice some. **"I was hoping that through the GA I could find the last of the remaining Jedi."** He paused once more giving it time for his words to settle in. **"I'm Force sensitive. If I'm there this Sith may be able to sense I'm close and compromise this action against them."**
He looked at Jakira once more. He left out the information about Jakira also being Force Sensitive. It would be up to her to reveal that sensitive information. Though if she was also out there she would be in danger of detection by the Sith too.

---

### **Alicia** (2011-10-23 19:03:52)

It doesn't surprise Jakira in the slightest when Wes eagerly volunteers his services on the front line of the coming conflict, but as he meets her gaze she is surprised when he reveals their greatest secret - at least part of it. Wes was leaving the decision to reveal her own Sensitivity to her a consideration she was grateful for, but given the circumstances would probably only cause problems. As he looks at her she places her trust in Wes's ability to judge who to trust.
Shifting her gaze to the general she makes her own confession. "**We both might…**" She couldn't let Wes face this challenge alone - they were stronger together. "**If the Sith senses either of us, we would draw him like a moth to the flame. With our lack of training we can't hide from him.**"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-10-26 20:28:14)

The General remained silent for a few moments, stroking his cheek as he took in this new information.
**"I get what you´re saying, but in all honesty, I don´t really think it will matter. If they have any brains, the Sith will already have figured out something will be coming, and it´s not like we´re going to postpone our operation. Besides, from what I know Lord Devon only just arrived here. Even if he can sense you, will he be able to tell that you are out to bring him some pain, or could he just take you for some random civilian?"**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-11-09 09:10:30)

Not receiving an answer, the General nods and offers a salute to Wes and Jakira.
**"Well then, you are free to make your own calls, but I hope to see you both in the hangar in twelve hours. That´s when we´ll move out"**
Without another word, the veteran soldier walks away with hasted steps. Obviously, he have things to do.
