<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**General**</span>

* If a character has levels in multiple classes that uses a 3/4 BaB scale, he can sum those levels together when determining his BaB.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Equipment**</span>

* A character wearing armor that contains any kind of glove or gauntlet (pretty much any armor except the ones specially described as vests) is treated as wearing a set of combat gloves.
* Ignore the rule about powered armor having 2 free upgrade slots, and instead treat powered armor as having 1 more slot than the normal of their type. This includes Beskar'gam as well, as it is supposed to have the same amount of slots as powered armor.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Droids**</span>

* A droid can use his Strength score to determine bonus Hit Points and Fortitude Defense bonus, as well as his Endurance skill modifier. He can not, however, use it in place of Constitution for the purpose of prerequistites for feats or talents.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Posting Guidelines</span>**

* Since these games are meant to be able to tightly follow the schedule of the player, I will not bother setting up specific requirements for how often to post. However, I would like to see a post at least every 2-3 days. If you know you will be busy, or away, or something, just let me know, or I´ll start to question your interest in the game when you don´t post for like a week.
* I won´t demand that you make post of multiple paragraphs with every post, if you feel like just responding in a conversation, without adding any specific details, that is fine with me. Keep in mind though, that you are the only player in this game, and you may get the feeling that it is more me telling a story than you playing a game if you don´t invest something in your post.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Character Sheet Guidelines</span>**

* I ask that you please use the character sheet post model (or a similar model ), since I find that one easy to read and it has a good structure.
* When listing upgraded or modified equipment, place the name of the modification or upgrade in parentheses. *Example: Blaster Pistol(Improved Accuracy)*
* When listing items that functions as containers (Bandoliers, Utility Belts, etc), place the contents of the container in hard parentheses. *Example: Bandolier[Frag Grenade, Knife]*
* While you don´t have to edit your sheet every time you use ammo, loses HP, get new equipment etc, try to keep them somewhat accurate.
