# The Tale of the Jedi Descendant

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-01 20:58:42)

*In these dark times, predators thrive, and one must watch out for them, or run the risk of becoming their prey. And, once again, the Jedi are among the most attractive prey of them all. Everywhere in the Galaxy, Imperial troopers, Sith, and bounty hunters alike searches for these former champions of the Galaxy. It is rumored that some Jedi have sought refuge with the Alliance Fleet, and some even among Roan Fel and his followers. But one thing is certain, gone are the days of glory when Jedi were respected and seen throughout the Galaxy. In these times, the appearance of Jedi typically means one thing: An risk that a hunter might soon follow in his wake.
In such times, one might wonder why anyone would reach out a hand to help these fallen heroes. Why would someone risk so much to help those wanted dead by so many? Maybe they remember the days of old, when even a single Jedi could change the face of the Galaxy. Or maybe they just see it as a way to put a finger in the eye of the oppression. Thoughts like these are what flies through the head of a lone Cerean youth as he leans back in his seat in a shuttle destined for the planet Dantooine. He really don´t know why he is going there, other than a cryptic message urging him to come to the aid of Karka Brei'lya, a Bothan Jedi Knight who had spent some time on Cerea, instructing him in the ways of the Force.
This is where our tale begins.* 
((Sorry for the delay, your character info didn´t give me too much to work with, but I think I´ve got something nice figured out now))

As Vree slowly comes out of his Jedi trance, the familiar sights and sounds of a transport shuttle wash over him. The slight rank smell masked by harsh chemicals, the acidic smell of electronics not working at 100% all contributed to Vree missing the organic smells of Cerea. If he was not on Cerea than Dantooine was a good substitute. He had heard much of rolling hills and pastoral lands and looked forward to air that was not scrubbed by a ship’s systems.
Vree could not help but fondly remember his time with the rascally Karka, Years his senior, Karka had been a good friend and mentor. As he remembered the times that they trained against a remote it brought a wiry grin to his usually stoic face. He missed the easy comfort of conversing with the young Bothan rather than the conflicted feelings that had become the norm these last few years. Was the Jedi path the correct one? Should he stay on Cerea and assume the mantle of his family, or embrace the destiny of his ancient ancestor Ki-Adi? Those questions would have to wait until he was assured of Karka’s safety. That, and that alone was worth the many light-years traveled in the semi-broken down shuttle.
As Vree approached Dantooine, he went through his mental checklist. Did he have all the supplies that he needed to begin to investigate? Did he have a plan for finding his friend? Vree slowly reached forward and pressed the comm button on the shuttle. Instantly a half-meter high blue holo of Karka sprang to life. As the image wavered, Vree listened once again to his friend’s plea for immediate assistance on Dantooine.
Vree switched the holo off after a few seconds of static marked the end of the message. Then he did what he always did, removed his datapad from his backpack and began to study Dantooine.
((I hope that works, sorry that I did not provided you with enough information. I do appreciate the thread and if there is something I need to do let me know. In order to know more about Dantooine Vree makes a Knowledge (Galactic Lore +11) check & he’ll take 10. Basically trying to piece together the information from the distress call and find out where to land))

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-02 01:06:09)

Studying his datapad, Vree identifies Dantooine as a temperate world on the outer rim, known for its rich farmlands and beautiful nature. It is scarcely populated, with inhabitants centered in a small number of settlements, with only a few major ones having established landing pads and holding more than a number of farmer families at once. One such settlement is Garang, where his shuttle is scheduled to land.
Dantooine seems to have played a role in the larger schemes of the Galaxy on more than one occasion. In ancient times it housed a secret Jedi enclave, that was destroyed by war, with only overgrown ruins now remaining. Nor far from those ruins, more recent ones stand, remains of a rebel base erected and destroyed during the first Galactic Civil War. Prior to those events, it was the site of a massive battle between the forces of the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, where Jedi Master Mace Windu led his forces to victory almost single-handedly.
As the shuttle moves in for landing, Vree gathers his stuff and descends the boarding ramp and onto a small clearing serving as a landing area. A few hundred meters away he can spot a larger structure which he suspects must be the Garang settlement. As he takes a few steps away from the shuttle - being the only passenger to descend, and being passed by a few labor droids hurrying to assist in unloading the ships cargo - he is approached by a dull-silvered droid.
**"Greeting traveler, and welcome to Dantooine. How may I assist you?"**
((
The message was basically just an insistence that you come to Dantooine, nothing more.
))

### **chiech22** (2011-12-02 17:21:39)

Before Vree descends the ramp he slowly settles on the floor of the shuttle and centers himself in the Force. He reaches out in the Force to his friend Karka.
((Take 10 Use the Force +15 (Sense Force); Take 10 Use the Force +15 (Telepathy to Karka) “Here”))
After a few moments, he rises, collects his belongings, and wraps his robe tightly about him to hide his belted-in lightsaber.
As Vree walks down the landing ramp, he inhales deeply hoping to get a whiff of the prairie flowers in bloom. Disappointed, he only smells the familiar smells of the Garang space port. Though not as large or busy as others, there seemed to be quite a bit of activity. Vree deliberately scans the Space Port.
((Take 20 Perception +10)).
Vree turns to see the silver droid amble up to him.
(Basic) **“Thank you for the kind welcome to your beautiful world. I am looking for reasonably priced lodging while I stay on your planet. I was hoping that you could suggest a place or two that are close to any Garang centers of learning, and have a view of the wondrous grasslands on your planet”**

Wow already to Dantooine. I read some of the other threads and in one game you spent close to 3 months on the ship. If I am hurrying the game along, please let me know

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-02 19:15:50)

Reaching out into the Force, Vree can sense not only one, but three other presences in the Force, and he is surprised at how close they are. As he walks down the ramp and get a look at the major Garang settlement structures, he figures they must be in there somewhere. Strangely enough though, they doesn´t feel familiar to him at all. And if Karka had indeed heard his call, the Jedi have chosen not to answer him.
As he looks around, he recognizes the landing area as not being a spaceport of any kind, but rather just a large, walled in clearing, supposedly capable of holding about four or five ships of the shuttles size at once, or possibly a single larger craft. Apart form the shuttle he had arrived in and the people - and droids - unloading it, another ship is also landed, seemingly more of a tourist liner, given the number of people exiting it. A lone mechanic also skirts along the walls of the place, checking up on various pieces of equipment.
The protocol droid looks at the Cerean, and gestures towards the major settlement.
**"I trust you will be able to find satisfactory accommodations inside, and if you are interested in touring the landscapes, speeders are available for rent. I would highly recommend that you seek out a guide if you are planning on such ventures though. It is mating season for the kath hounds, and that means that one should be extra careful"**
((
Just as some introductory pointers, please put all OOC comments (such as skill checks or game mechanic descriptions of action) in double parenthesis at the end of your posts, to keep the IC part clean.
Don´t worry about rushing the game along. I keep the pace of the game, and if nothing happened on the ship, it was most likely because I hadn´t planned for something to happen.
))

### **chiech22** (2011-12-02 23:00:16)

**Basic:
Many thanks. I most definitely need to observe those Kath hounds.**
Vree makes his way towards the lone mechanic.
**Basic:
Hello Friend. You look as if you know one end of a hydospanner form another. It was recommended to me that I should rent a speeder. You from around here? Any idea where I can find a reliable speeder and who a good tour guide would be?**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-02 23:27:10)

The mechanic, an elderly human male with a few patches of gray hair left on the sides of his head, looks up at Vree and shakes his head.
**"Does it look like that´s my department? Talk to one of the droids, or look over at the settlement, I´ve got work to do"**
Turning back to his work, he mutters something that Vree can´t quite make out, other than something about "crazy aliens".
((
You don´t need to specify that you are speaking in basic, rather specify when you *don´t*. I´ll just assume that anything spoken or written is in Basic, unless otherwise noted.
You have already tried to sense any Force sensitives in the vicinity, so making another check won´t reveal anymore than it already have. In fact, for simplicity, when you successfully uses Sense Force against a person on someone, I´ll inform you if you can sense the Dark Side or not.
Perception checks to Sense Deception is a reaction, so I´ll take care of that whenever you need to roll one. It will get quite annoying rather fast if you´re going to roll such checks "just in case" with everyone.

Your welcome ::scarcasm::

</details>

Vree thinks that that particular local was not very nice or helpful, but that is to be expected in this galaxy. He stubbornly reminds himself that Karka could be in serious trouble and he needs to find him straightaway.. He calmly turns around and walks back to the droid.
**Hello again, can you please download a map of Garang to my datapad before I head to the settlement structures?**
Vree centers himself in the force,
There is no emotion, there is peace.
There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.
He thinks to himself "Where are you Karka?"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-03 10:35:47)

The droid answers in the pleasant, welcoming tone one expects from a protocol droid.
**"Certainly, sir"**
The droid takes the datapad for a moment and inserts a datacard in it, uploading a map of Garang and its immediate surroundings. It then hands the datapad back to Vree.
**"There you go sir. If you have any more questions regarding the status of the local guided tours or speeder rentals, I recommend seeking out the administrative office in the main facility building"**
The map reveals Garang to be much of a hub to the outside world, listing no permanent accomodations but a few places where one can stay temporarily. It indicates the main structure in the middle of the settlement to be the primary seat of government and administration, and just like the droid said, it would probably be a good place to start looking for information.

---

### **chiech22** (2011-12-03 14:25:34)

**Thanks and a good day to you.**
Vree gathers his belongings before joining the queue of creatures from the tourist liner as they exit the landing area. He makes his way towards the administrative office in the main facility building. Vree keeps his mouth closed and his ears open on the trek over.
((
Take 10 Perception +10 (eavesdrop). I know that I made an initial Perception check once I got off the shuttle, but since I am in the queue now thought I'd listen in to see what type of tourist comes to Dantooine. Might help me come up with a decent believeable story/reason for being here.
))

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-04 05:32:09)

Concluding his business at the landing area, Vree falls in step with the recently arrived group of people as they begin the short trek towards the settlement, something that erects a few looks from some of the people in the group, but no one seems to care much. From what they are talking about, it seems like they are a couple of families arriving on Dantooine to visit relatives to one of them, and show the other the beautiful nature of the planet. Among the group is also found two Ithorians who are dressed like they might be scientists of some sort, but without the ability to comprehend what they are saying to each other, Vree can only guess.
Upon arriving at the settlement, he walks past a couple of smaller structures that seems to be either storage facilities or garages of some sort and a street vendor shouting out a good discount on some fruits native to Dantooine before he arrives at the main administrative building. Going inside, he notices a soothing shift in temperature from the sunny outside on the settlement, and he soon finds an information desk manned by a young human female. After a few moments of finishing something on her screen, the receptionist looks up with a welcoming smile on her face.
**"Welcome sir, how may I help you?"**

---

### **chiech22** (2011-12-04 16:55:52)

Vree enters into the main administrative building. His thoughts wander to his growing hunger pains and the weariness of the long trip settle in. As always, his anxiety at where Karka is lingers just below his surface thoughts.
**Good day to you Miss. I recently arrived to your beautiful planet and the most helpful welcoming droid said that you might be able to help me find temporary lodgings. I also understand that there are speeder rentals nearby. After settling in, I might be interested in renting a guide and hire a guide. Any suggestions would be appreciated.**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-05 21:11:59)

**"Of course. You should be able to find accommodations in one of the complexes just outside this building, and speeder rentals are located near the western border of the settlement. I am afraid however, that all out licensed guides are unavailable for the moment, due to the increased need for surveillance now that the kath hounds are growing more aggressive"**

---

### **chiech22** (2011-12-06 21:31:27)

**Thank you so much. Everyone has been so polite here. Well except for that mechanic that hangs out in the landing area. ::: Do you regularly entertain off-world visitors? I hope to meet up with a friend, a Bothan as is it and was wondering if you have seen any lately?**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-07 20:59:19)

The young woman thinks for a moment before answering.
**"I cannot recall seeing a Bothan coming in lately, though it is possible of course that he may have come in at some other landing site. Are you sure he was coming to Garang?"**

---

### **chiech22** (2011-12-07 22:14:56)

**Sorry, his message was quite short and only stated that he was on Dantooine. I am sure that he will turn up soon. You have been most helpful and I appreciate all the assistance that you have given me.**
Vree exits the main administration office and makes his way to one of the nearby complexes to secure shelter.
((
I am wondering how close I am to the three force users. Can I make another Use the Force check now that I am in Garang proper, or do I know where the force users are? I also should have made it clear earlier that I am, or am from now on, trying to conceal myself in the Force.
))

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-11 07:41:34)

As Vree exits the central building, he notices a pair of human males leaning against the wall just outside the doors, talking among themselves. As he walks into the settlement, his peripheral vision reveals one of them walking a short distance behind him. As his attention focuses, he realizes that the you man must be one of the Force sensitives he felt before. Before he has a chance to react on this information though, his path is blocked by the second man, apparently having taken a shortcut to get ahead of him.
The man, likely somewhere in his early twenties, is tall and muscular with brown hair cut short. This, along with his resolute stance could be indications of a military background, but more importantly, Vree senses the Force inside this one as well.
He takes a moment to look the Cerean over and then focuses on his face.
**"So, we heard you are looking for a Bothan. Might I ask why?"**

---

### **chiech22** (2011-12-11 16:24:29)

Vree calmly sidesteps so that he is facing both men. He folds his hands into the selves of his robe.
**Good day gentlemen. It appears that there are few secrets in a settlement this small, and even fewer manners. I don't believe that we have been properly introduced. My name is Vree. And your names good fellows?**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-15 00:53:58)

The man crosses his arms in front of his chest, and it seems clear he isn´t going to be swayed by any word tricks. The second man who had been following Vree comes closer as well. Waving a quick halt to him, the closest man looks back to Vree.
**"Introductions and manners are left for those you feel you can trust, not everyone. Now I ask again, why do you seek the Bothan?"**

---

### **chiech22** (2011-12-15 03:06:15)

**"Ah good friends, it appears that we have changed from 'a' Bothan to 'the' Bothan. As it was I received a brief message from a Bothan friend of mine asking me to come to Dantoioine. Apparently he has gotten himself into a bit of trouble and I am here to assist him. Shall we find a more suitable location to continue this discussion? I would hate for stray eyes and ears to hear or see something they should not."**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-01-12 04:02:24)

Sharing a couple of quick looks between each other, the men nods, and the closest one motions for Vree to follow him, with the second man following behind.
**"You are quite the odd one, aren´t you? A Cerean looking for a Bothan here on Danooine of all places. But if you tell me why you are looking for him, maybe I can help you"**

---

### **chiech22** (2012-01-16 07:12:34)

**Why yes gentlemen, I have been considered odd, even by Cerean standards. And you are quite right about this precarious situation. It reminds me of the time a Sullustan, a Dug, and a Twi'lek walk into a cantina … but I digress … when serious matters are at hand.
I have been quite forthright with you gentlemen, more so that I should when I still don't know your names, nor how you located me, nor how you know my old friend Karka. Karka and I are very old friends. He would often visit me on my homeworld of Cerea. My family lived not too far from one of the few spaceports. He would come and visit, and … teach me. Cerea is an isolated world full of rigidity and tradition. It is very difficult to alter these oppressive customs, and Karka has been one of the few to guide me in my growth to distance myself from these customs. I know little else of why he is here, and what danger he in in other than the transmission he sent me that he was in trouble and needed immediate assistance on Dantooine. I suggest you share what information you posses so together we may devise a plan, and quickly. Nothing is more important than finding Karak to me. Nothing.**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-01-20 06:49:14)

The two men once again shares a look and a nod between them. Apparently that was the kind of answer they had been looking for. They lead Vree to a small rental storage facility in the side of a building, and opens the outer door to reveal a small landspeeder which takes up most of the space.
**"You'll have to forgive us if we startled you, but judging by your reactions, we probably have a far better grasp of what's hunting our Bothan friend than you do. Name's Jorgan, by the way, and that's Zaf. I take it the old furball have been teaching you some of his Jedi tricks as well, right?"**

---

### **chiech22** (2012-01-21 07:04:06)

**Well met, Jorgn. Well met, Zaf. Karka was as close to a master as I have ever had. I also believe that I am not the only one here that knows …tricks is it? Once I arrived on Dantooine, in addition to looking like a complete country rube, I felt the presence of three force users. You and Zaf make two. I wonder, where do you think the other resides, and is he/she with us? But please continue, what danger faces my old friend and mentor? I can only imagine he has fallen into a nest of Gundarks, or is after a Krayt dragon pearl. Karka always had a flair for the dramatic.**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-01-21 16:57:27)

**"Well, it´d be nice if it was just some of his usual stunts, but this time he´s gotten in a bit over his head I think. He told us some weeks ago that he had caught on to something big happening in the Sith ranks, and we tried to help him uncover what it was. But then he sent us a message telling us to get here as fast as we could, saying that he was being followed. Which means the news that you´ve sensed another being here beyond the two of us is rather disturbing"**
Motioning for Vree to get into the speeder, the mans face showed a hint of genuine concern, and it was clear he was worried.
**"He told us he´d be waiting for us near the ruins of the old Jedi enclave, so we should get going"**

---

### **chiech22** (2012-01-22 07:45:33)

Vree slowly sank into the speeder. He fought the rising feeling of fear that began in his bowls. Sith. He was really going to encounter the Sith. It was one thing to explore his Force abilities on his peaceful home wold of Cerea, but another to stand face to face with a Sith. He could picture the look of hatred, the glowing red lightsaber. Dusty tomes, and scholarly pursuits were the areas in which he excelled. Crossing lightsabers, the sparks flying. That was another story.
Vree quietly began a Jedi meditation technique. The calmness and serenity of the Force began to wash over him, slowly at first like the gentle waves upon the shore, growing more powerful buy the moment until his fear and anxiety were flushed out of him. He remember one of the last conversations he had with Karka, when he learned of his ancestry. He could not believe that he was really descended from the great Jedi General Ki-Adi-Mundi. The same blood that gave strength to the General during the Clone Wars flowed through his veins. There had to be courage in him. There had to be that fighting spirit that allowed Ki-Adi to leave Cerea behind and take his first step into a larger world.
**So Sith. You know they don't do that whole Rule of Two thing anymore. How many do you think there are? And why in the Galaxy would they be here, on Dantooine?**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-01-22 09:04:18)

Jorgan jumps into the back seat next to Vree, with Zaf taking the drivers seat. The young man kicks the speeder running, and it takes of with a rushing start, and a late warning.
**"Hang on!"**
As they soar out over the vast plains of Dantooine, Jorgan absently pulls out a heavy blaster and checks its power pack.
**"We don´t know that there is a Sith here, but if there is, I´d suppose he - or they - is searching for Karka. Though it may be possible that whatever they are doing has something to do with the old ruins here, which would also explain why he would call us here of all places"**
Looking out over the plains again, he smiled.
**"No sense in worrying about things we don´t know anything about. What I would be worried about are the fact that the Kath are known to roam the enclave surroundings, and they´re apparently in some sort of mating frenzy at the moment"**

---

### **chiech22** (2012-01-22 13:28:35)

Vree picks himself off of Jorgan.
**Sorry. Obviously the Force is no match for Zaf's driving.**
Vree takes his datapad out, and begins to search about Kath hounds.
To Jorgan **So are you trained in the Jedi arts, or are you just able to use the Force?**
((

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-01-22 16:21:35)

Jorgan smiles and actually laughs a bit before looking back at Vree.
**"What´s the difference? Because apart from the Force and an overcharged glow rod, Jedi are people just like everyone else, with a certain philosophy. But if you´re asking whether he schooled us in the Jedi Code and taught us how to use lightsabers, then no. He taught us enough that we wouldn´t be a danger to ourselves or anyone else, and he taught us how to use the Force to benefit us in our daily lives. And in exchange, we kept our eyes and ears open for him"**
Scrolling through his datapad, Vree learns that the Kath hound is a native species to Dantooine, a dog-like creature known to be a fierce predator. Apparently a few variations of breeds exists, but differences appears to be cosmetic.

---

### **chiech22** (2012-01-22 20:03:52)

**Jorgan, Jorgan, Jorgan. To say that the Jedi are merely uppity philosophicals is a gross misunderstanding of the highest magnitude. Karka, bless his heart, was wise to teach you of the Force. But to leave it at that is almost a crime. Let us take the blaster. The blaster in the hands of a law-enforcement officer is Justice, a blaster in the hands of a soldier is a Tool, a blaster in the hands of a mother protecting a child is Life, but a blaster in the hands of a murderer is Death, undiscriminating Death. The Jedi are the only ones who truly understand the Will of the Force because they succumb to its will. We listen and are guided by the Force. It controls us; not we control it. The Sith are the murders, killing on a whim, deciding between life and death, using the ultimate power of the universe. The Jedi are guardian of peace and justice because it is the Force that rules us.
True we are people, normal people with flaws. But the Code connects us to the will of the Force. That connection is what separates us from everyone else. Even you. I am not saying that you need to become a Jedi, but be wary of how you use the Force.
A hope I do not offend. Often I speak my mind and few take kindly to it.**
Tries to laugh to lighten the mood.
To Zaf **How long before we reach the ruins? I am afraid that my brief research will offers us little insight to these Kath hounds.** 
((

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-01-23 18:06:28)

Shaking his head while smiling, Jorgan goes back to watching the landscape outside.
**"I don´t know where you´ve been locked up your whole life, but hang around for a while in the real world and you´ll find out a blaster is just a blaster no matter who holds it. The most defining trait of those who see things as black and white is that they tend to get lost when things turn gray"**
In response to Vree question, Zaf calls back from the drivers seat.
**"ETA about 10 minutes, and then some on foot. Don´t wanna get too close with the speeder with the hounds running wild. Better not try to stir them up if we can avoid it"**
The ruins they are approaching, as Vree can find out, were once a small Enclave used by the Jedi Order for training of their students, but it was apparently reduced to nothing but empty ruins in an orbital strike several millennium ago.

---

### **chiech22** (2012-01-24 18:19:01)

**Yes Jorgan I rarely if ever get off Cerea, but do not discount my warnings lightly. When you live a life of gray you tend to forget there is a white, and for that matter, a very detrimental black.
Once we find Karka, I'd like to study these Kath hounds. Now mind you, I am not interested in seeing them up close in mating season. One never wants to see a male in those circumstances. Just ask my wives. Haha.**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-01-31 20:46:47)

It is impossible for Vree to know if Karka had sensed his presence or not, as the lack of a response is direct. Jorgan seems to have fallen into his own thoughts looking out over the landscape they passes, but Zaf laughs a bit when he mentions the Kath hounds.
**"Take my advice and settle for what research have been gathered in the archives. Saw a Kath rip a prey apart once, not a pretty sight. Be that they aren´t that aggressive, but still, why take the risk?"**
As the speeder soars over a hill, Vree can see a massive structure in the distance, or at least what was left of one. Now the thing, even at this distance, looked like little more than a deserted ruin and unless its manufactured features stood out from the rest of the surroundings, it may just have been a pile of rocks like any other. A big pile though.
**"Well, friend, there you have it, the enclave ruins. Which means our Bothan master should be here in the area somewhere. Unfortunately he didn´t say where exactly, so we´ll just have to do this the old-fashioned way"**

---

### **chiech22** (2012-02-07 08:16:23)

**I agree. Do you or Zaf was to sweep the perimeter in the speeder while we explore the ruins?**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-12 18:47:19)

**"I think we should keep together if we can. I´d guess the Kath are like most beasts and keep their distance from things that looks like they could be harmful to them, and it´s not sure that only one or two of us might do that trick"**
Setting the speeder down, the two men emerges, and Zaf opens up a storage compartment and picks out a hunting rifle and checks its functionality while Jorgan picks up a pair of electrobinoculars and starts to look the area over.
**"It looks like there is a cave opening in those hills over there. Might be as good a place as any to start"**

---

**A cave. Great. What do we have for light sources? I have my overcharged glow rod. Any other supplies we need to bring with?**
Vree opens his pack and begins to take inventory.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-12 21:07:11)

**"We have a few glow rods and armament, I think hat should be enough. I don´t know if that cave leads into a larger complex, but we most likely won´t be moving around in there for too long"**
Slinging the rifle on his back, Zaf takes point with Jorgan waving for Vree to follow suit.

---

### **chiech22** (2012-02-18 19:51:46)

**Looks like caves it is.**
Vree folds his hands in his robes and walks briskly to join Zaf and Jorgan, falling into stride with Jorgan.
**Have you and Zaf explored these ruins at all? Leave it to Karka to pick an completely uninhabitable ruins to meet. I do admit that my curiosity of the old ruins is worth the adventure. Imagine if we stumbled upon a long lost artifact like a Holocron, and some unread text detailing a secret long lost to the Jedi.**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-27 18:01:21)

**"We arrived here late yesterday, and we´ve performed some quick recon in the area, but have not ventured into these caverns and ruins as of yet. But I wouldn´t get my hopes up if I were you, this enclave was destroyed millennium ago, and as far as I know it was never taken into use by the Jedi again. I´d be surprised if time, scavengers and the indigenous fauna have left anything of value behind"**
As the trio approaches the cave entrance, Zaf halts for a moment and shines his glow rod inside, revealing a barren stone tunnel inside. The walls were clean from all traces of the various fungi and other growths that were usually found in such walls, likely due to the proximity to the entrance. The tunnel seemed to stretch quite a bit, but on its sides you all notice it splitting of in new directions. Placing his glow rod in a designated strap on his shoulder, Zaf picks up his rifle in two hands.
**"Well, looks like we´ve got some ground to cover in there. Since we´re still some distance from the main enclave complex, I´d say these should be natural caverns, which means they might make for pretty good nests for the Kath or other creatures. Still, I´ve heard some rumors of this place containing ruins the even predates the Jedi Enclave, so if we have some luck, this might turn into an archaeological venture"**
Smiling at the last sentence, he starts of into the cavern.

---

### **chiech22** (2012-02-28 17:19:13)

**Ah Zaf, my love of scholarly pursuits and Karka have compelled me to follow you into these caverns. I do say that I am quite surprised that the Kath Hounds inhibit these cavers. I assumed that they roamed the plains. So we are to enter these caverns and hope that they lead the the ruined Enclave, where we hope that we can find Karka? If I ever doubted that you know Karka, my fears are definitely assailed. Why don't you and Jorgan take the lead while I guard our backs.**
Vree unlatches his lightsaber as he makes his way towards the entrance.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-29 09:23:28)

Walking in the front with the rifle held casually in both hands, Zaf moves forward at a slow pace, letting his glow rod shine on their surroundings as they move forward.
**"I´m just guessing. The Kath might be primitive beasts, but when the sun peaks out on those plains they probably want to be somewhere cool, just like everything else. But I´m no expert on Dantoonian fauna, there might be other things here that prefers these caverns as well"**
As you continue, Zaf´s point is well made as the temperature seems to drop quite a bit from out on the plains, and creates a very cool environment. The cave walls also gradually starts to cover up with various types of plants, stuff of the kind that thrives in cool, lightless environments. As you reach the first place where the tunnel splits up, Zaf stops and shines his glow rod into the breakaway tunnel, revealing a tunnel almost identical to the one you´ve been walking in so far.
**"And no, I have no clue where these tunnels leads. Might lead into the enclave ruins, might lead into a nest of predators, or might simply lead nowhere but dead ends. All I know is that Karka didn´t give any specifics on where to meet him, so we might just get on with it and start looking"**

---

### **chiech22** (2012-02-29 18:19:51)

**I am going to try and make a crude map on my datapad. We should prepare for any eventuality. Let's sync comlinks and in case we get split up, we should set some sort of rendezvous point. I too am no expert on Dantooine fauna and flora, but I have studied the biological sciences. In my experience, the kath hounds will only retire after feeding so that should make them less aggressive. Also, they will choose a lair close enough to still retain easy access to the plains, but secluded enough to afford them some semblance of protection. We should continue in further.
With the Force as our guide, hopefully this will be a short jaunt before we reach the ruins, and Karka.**

After a moment of consideration, Zaf decides to stick to the main tunnel instead of splitting off. Moving further in, you can all notice that the ground is sloping slightly downwards, and by this time you are likely somewhat below ground level. The tunnel does seem to widen a bit, and after a minute or so of walking, you arrive at a four way split, with tunnels leading in varied directions.

---

### **chiech22** (2012-03-02 06:36:05)

Vree centers himself in the force, pushing all thoughts aside to become one. He could feel the Force flowing through him, guiding him, With the Force as his allay, Vree knew he could handle any situation.
**Let's turn to the east.**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-09 06:58:48)

Vree heads down the tunnel that leads him in an eastish direction, not really having the luxury of choosing an exact path. Jorgan and Zaf follows him after a moment of hesitation. As they head down their chosen path, a feeling starts to creep up on Vree, on that he cannot really identify. He did not feel as if he had made a mistake going in this direction, but there was an aura of caution in the air, and he felt as if something was indeed waiting ahead. What that something was though, he could only guess.
After following the tunnel for a while (and its many twists and turns now had them walking in a somewhat south-southeast direction as far as Vree could tell), their surroundings begins to change. The natural, rough surfaces starts to smooth out, and eventually the tunnel turns into more of an artificial walkway, with durasteel braces lining the walls and ceiling at intervals. Whatever they had entered into, it was certainly not a natural cavern anymore.

---

### **chiech22** (2012-03-09 08:28:44)

**Well we are not in the caverns anymore - any idea where we are at? Regardless we are going to push ahead. I feel something, but I am not exactly sure what I feel. If I was you I would be prepared. I am going to try and sense if we are alone.**
Vree adjusts the grip on his lightsaber, thumbing the trigger, but not igniting it. Zaf and Jorgan seems to be trustworthy, but one never knows. It was always so much easier when Karka took the lead. Apparently this is what he meant when he was told so often that he needed to grow up.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-10 05:41:06)

**"Not a clue, though like I said, this planet is said to house ruins that far predates the Jedi Enclave…perhaps we´ve stumbled into one of them"**
Zaf´s voice was a mix of excitement and caution. As Vree reached out into the Force he found nothing, only the same sensation he had felt before. A few dozen meters ahead the tunnel widened, and the trio found themselves standing in a large chamber of some sort. As Zaf shifted to allow his glow rod to illuminate the place they spotted several other tunnels connecting to the chamber, along with supporting pillars reaching up to the roof - which was quite a but higher than the tunnel - and lining the walls were various ornaments and carvings.
What caught their attention though - or at least it caught Zafs, enough that he would center both glow rod and rifle point on it - was a figure clad in a black robe, kneeling in the middle of the circular chamber, muttering something incomprehensible and barely possible to hear. Who- or whatever the creature was, it appeared to have taken no notice of their presence.

---

### **chiech22** (2012-03-10 08:22:55)

Vree quickly examines the carvings. He motions Zaf to hold his position, and waves Jorgan to move off to the right. Vree calmly walks toward the creature in the middle of the chamber stopping about 5 meters away. He kneels down, facing the creature.
**Greetings. We apologize for the intrusion, but the Force has directed me here.**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-14 19:38:52)

A quick glance at the carving that lines the walls of the room tells Vree absolutely nothing. Whatever it is, writing, decorations or something else entirely, he has never seen anything like it before.
The creature sitting down doesn´t appear to react to Vrees words, but as the Cerean moves closer, his shoulders begins to move, and a laughter rises in strength. Getting up to his feet, slowly, he turns around and lifts a hand to pull down the hood of his robe.
**"Are you sure that it was the Force that guided you here? I would have thought it was me"**
As the hood falls, the face of an elder Bothan is revealed, with streaks of grey having entered into the fur and the mustache-like trails running down from his face. Nevertheless, the face is one the three explorers all recognizes, and somewhat surprising, their journey found a quick end. For indeed, they have found the Jedi Master, Karka Brei'lya.

---

### **chiech22** (2012-03-15 21:15:54)

Vree's eyes grow wide in surprise. He lets out the breath that he has been holding the last few seconds. Clipping his lightsaber onto his belt, he strides forward, a grin of unmatched jubilation on his face. He extends his hand only to find Karka's waiting grip.
**My master. What a merry chase you have led us on. Breeding Kath hounds, the presence of a dark side force user, Jorgan's driving. Master, peril lurked around every turn for us. You did not make this easy, masking your presence in the Force, rebuking my attempts to contact you. I am sure that you have a tremendous story for us. Please begin with, "I sent a distress signal to my apprentice."**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-21 19:54:09)

Taking Vrees hand and shaking it, the Bothan Jedi shakes his head as he pulls the hand back to draw through his hair. A smile on his face accompanied this gesture as he finally landed his hand on the Cereans shoulder.
**"I never seize to be amazed by how a member of a species knowing for its thinking abilities could produce an individual with such a lack of logical thinking. Do you really think I was hiding myself from *you*? And I have been keeping you under surveillance, exactly where did you find the things that caused you such peril?"**
Giving a reassuring pat on Vrees shoulder, the Bothan moved towards the two humans in the room.
**"He is talented, but rather naive and inexperienced with the Galaxy at large. However, I feared for the safety of all my apprentices, so I thought it vital that he came along. I hope he hasn´t caused you any trouble?"**

---

### **chiech22** (2012-03-23 07:51:51)

Vree ruefully shakes his head. His full-faced smile diminishing to a half-grin.
**You are correct master. I should know better than to believe a Bothan's message at face value. I forget that your species grows up on intrigue and subterfuge as well as your mother's milk. So now that we are all here; your dejarik pieces all in order, are we to face this mysterious darksider that I have felt?**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-26 19:20:54)

The Bothan turns around to look at Vree, and his face shows that there is in fact a serious tone behind his words.
**"Is that what you would want? To rush away and take a fight with an opponent you know nothing about? I thought that my years of teaching had given you more wisdom than that. Comparing us to pieces on a dejarik board may sound harmless, but perhaps you should consider what such an analogy really means"**
Without any further look at the Cerean he turns back to talk to the two humans.

---

### **chiech22** (2012-04-01 07:42:16)

Vree ruefully shakes his head. Why must every conversation lately be so strained? His master, as always, never seemed to understand what he was saying. Vree's eagerness to learn, to be trusted as an equal, always seems to be misconstrued as brashness. He had no desire to rush headlong into a fight with darkside users; yet, still being on a need-to-konw basis deeply saddened him. An outsider on Cerea, an outsider here on Dantoinne with his master's new apprentices, he wondered if he would ever find his place in the universe. Vree walks over to his master, Zaf, and Jorgan.
**Master, Zaf, Jorgan, I believe that we have a misunderstanding. My apologies to all if I have offended** Vree give a slight bow from his waist. His height and ungainly manner make this much less than an the elegant gesture he was hoping for.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-04-03 01:57:44)

Before the Bothan can respond, it is Jorgan that does, in his usual dry tone.
**"You haven´t offended anyone, kid, but like I said before, it is time you wake up and smell reality. Being out on adventure is not what they make it look in holovids, especially not when there is someone trying to kill you"**
Karka nods, supporting his human apprentices statement.
**"You have spent much of your time in the peace of your home. And if you want, you can return there, but I had been hoping you could help. But if you are to do so, you must first open your eyes a bit, or you will end up like that poor sob over there"**
The Bothan Jedi makes a gesture towards the ragged pieces of cloth on the ground where they had found him, and upon closer inspection, it did seem like there were something else among them.
**"Take a closer look, and perhaps you will see what we mean"**

---

### **chiech22** (2012-04-03 18:53:56)

In the euphoria of seeing his Master, Vree must have overlooked the remains where his master knelt. He slowly approaches, and kneels to examine then.
((

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-04-12 22:49:20)

As Vree kneels next to the rags he had found his master sitting by, he rummages through the thick fabric until a lighter tone is revealed underneath, and as he folds away a piece of cloth he reveals a leg inside. Straight across the leg is a deep cut wound, sidelined by dirt and cauterized blood. Unwrapping more of the body, he reveals a great amount of similar wounds, as well as what appears to be a hole going clean through its belly. It suddenly strikes him that the injuries and the fact that they are cauterized are quite consistent with the kind of injuries inflicted by a lightsaber. It would seem reasonable that the fallen warrior had been an enemy of Karka, but why the excessive damage and numerous wounds? It was not the Jedi way to draw a combat out longer than necessary.
The shock strikes him however when he rolls the creature over to inspect its face though. As he turns the body over, he notices the traces of fur in the places not covered in cloth, blood or dirt, and he is taken quite aback when he finds a familiar face staring up at him from the ground. From his place on his back, he once again meets the gaze of Jedi Master Karka Brei'lya, only this time his eyes have lost all their warmth and seems to be gazing someplace far away, and the Bothans usual smile has been replaced by a face showing grim agony and pain.
At the same time - be it the Force or just sheer instinct - something tugs in the back of the Cereans mind, and in the same instant he hears the familiar sound of a lightsaber igniting, followed by a scream and a heavy crash, and the sound of a blaster discharging and a deflected bolt ricocheting into the ceiling. As he swings around, he can see Jorgan rapidly backing away from Karka, who holds a red-glowing energy blade in his hand, and just behind them he can see Zaf slumped against the wall, not moving.

---

### **chiech22** (2012-04-13 22:16:47)

Karka is dead. The though, the singular though, consumed his mind. All he could see were the burnt tufts of hair where the lightsaber singed Karka's fur, all he could smell was he char smell of burnt flesh, all he could hear was the silence of his Master, never to hear the jovial laughter, never to hear the stern reprimand. His mind reeled and a slash of pain shot through his brain like vibroknife. Anger began to well up in him, revenge, retribution. An indistinguishable voice called out to him, "No, that is not the Jedi way!" Was it his voice, was it Karka;s voice; whose voice was it?
His thoughts were interrupted by a scream. He quickly whirled on his feet like a Twilek dancer that had drunk too much alcohol, igniting his lightsaber mere inches from his side.
In the tiniest fraction of a second he processed that Zaf was down and Jorgan was in the fight of his life. This creature had taken down Karka. His Master. What chance did he have? No matter, pain and grief would be dealt with later. Time to aid the living.
With a comical surge he approached the murderer and swung his lightsaber.

Even as Vree makes his move, the Bothan Jedi seems to have forgotten all about his presence, and has all his attention directed at Jorgan. Closing the distance the man had managed to gain in a quick bound, its red energy blade slices quickly through the air, and Jorgan manages to avoid it only by millimeters. The human soldier admirably holds his calm but even as he fores his weapon point blank in the face of his opponent, the enemys weapon is too quick to fool, and the shot is harmlessly deflected away.
Taking advantage of the tunnel vision of his opponent, Vree manages to come up on him from behind, bringing his weapon in on the targets back. He is, however, caught completely off guard by the speed with which his opponent moves, and finds his own weapon intercepted and turned aside even without his opponent looking at him. As he feels the weapons connect though, he feels an immediate shift in momentum, and his opponent suddenly drops into a roll under his blade. As he opponent comes up next to him he can barely register the red flash before a searing pain shoots through his side, and he sees the vicious smile on his enemy face as confirmation that he had indeed been severely cut.

Vree stumbles backwards, barely keeping his feet. The pain, the searing pain overtakes his mind. His breath came in ragged gasps making concentration difficult as the pain enveloped him. Gone are the thoughts of Karka; his only though left is his survival. He knew this creature took down Karka, and he knew that he was no match for it. His only hope rest in his knowledge of the Force. He must win, or soon he would join his late master.
He shakily raised his normally steady hand. With a groan he concentrated his force power, willing the creature backwards.

Turning around with a devilish grin on its face, the Bothan Jedi - or whatever it was - brought its lightsaber up over its head and sent the crimson blade crashing down on Vree with tremendous power, and it is only barely that the Cerean manage to hold the attack back. Staggering backwards under the weight of the blow, he lashes out with the Force in a telekinetic blast that knocks his opponent over.

The tiniest fraction of Vree's mouth upturned in what could only be a smile. As the creature flew backwards, Vree gathered the Force to himself to stem the pain he was under. Ever so slightly regaining his composure, Vree raised his lightsaber and brought it down with all his strength.

The taunting smile of his opponent is quickly turned into a furious grin as Vree knocks his opponent of his feet, and it is an even more ferocious look that meets him as the creature attempts to stand upright. Swinging its weapon wildly, Vree is forced to take a step back as it gets up on its feet, but the attack becomes more of a distraction than any real threat. As it stumbles a bit, Vree seizes his opportunity and makes a quick swat to bat the red blade aside before he brings his weapon up overhead and down with might. His opponent twists to get out of the way, but the Cereans blade still grazes its shoulder, and Vree can feel the brief contact against bone.

Regaining his composure in the midst of battle was so unexpected. He knew that the longer this battle lasted, the worse it would be for Zak and Jorgan. He must end it quickly. Once again drawing on the Force, Vree raised his hand and let the Force flow through him.

Letting out a small grunt of pain as the energy blade draws blood, the Bothan fighter blankly stares at Vree for a few moments, catching its breath. In only a few moments though, he raises his own weapon over his head and lunges towards the Cerean again. The loss of blood in its arm seems to be taking its toll though, and he finds the attack lacking the sheer power of the previous ones, and he manages to easily parry it.
Suddenly the discharge of a blaster echoes in the circular cavern, and Vree sees his opponent jerk heavily as blood sprays behind him. Catching the moment of opportunity, he reaches out with the Force again, producing a powerful wave of the Force that sends the Bothan flying and crashing into the wall of the cave. And this time, he doesn´t get up again, and the red blade dies out as the metallic handle falls from his grip.
Looking to the side, Vree sees Jorgan down on one knee, in a shooters position with his rifle raised. As a few moments of staring at the fallen enemy shows he isn´t about to leap up and fight anytime soon, the human slowly gets to his feet and replaces the rifle on his back.

Sadly enough, Vree immediately notices the broken neck that indicated his friend was gone. The only comfort he can find is that the amount of force he hit the wall with would have made his passing quite painless. Suddenly another blaster shot echoes in the cavern, and as he turns around he can see a fresh pillar of smoke rising from the fallen opponent. Apparently Jorgan had also come to the conclusion that his friend would not be coming back to them.
Looking down at their opponent, Jorgan waves for the Cerean to come over.
**"Hey, come take a look at this"**

---

### **chiech22** (2012-07-02 08:18:51)

Though Vree only knew Zak a short time, he had developed a fondness for the man. With a loud exhale, Vree rises and quickly moves to Jorgan's side to examine this creature that had caused them so much grief.
