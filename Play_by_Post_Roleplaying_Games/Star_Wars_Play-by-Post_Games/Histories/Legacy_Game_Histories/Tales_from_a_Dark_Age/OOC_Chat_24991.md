Well, I figure one of these is always useful. We´ll keep a single, communal one for now, but if there becomes too much activity, I might split it down to one per campaign.

Two up, one to go.
Par, you still lack a few things in your sheet, namely places to carry your weapons. Unless you plan to hold them in hand all the time, a holster or two would be a good idea.

Such is the case after the game starts. If Servo has a utility belt there's a glow rod in one of the pouches.

Without a doubt the most useful item for a starting character to buy. As long as you stack it with some Mesh Tape.

### **BWS2K** (2011-02-28 10:16:02)

If he had some mesh tape he could even affix the electrobinoculars to his face and use that as **Darkvision** I suppose, but alas - he's only a droid, and not very knowledgeable about such... well, no. He probably just forgot. Maybe he was so excited to finally get a chance to explore that lovely cruiser that he neglected to follow his seven P's.

Time to enjoy a leisurely walk back to the spaceport, with ample time to consider what sorts of supplies most make sense...
**Glow Rods:** I've looked these up and I get varying accounts/depictions: Should I be thinking "flashlights" with rechargeable batteries or "glow sticks" that you break once and then hold or set down? I can spring for a fusion lantern, but glow rods are cheaper and if they act more as glow sticks or flares it makes a difference.
**Power Pack Bombs:** I don't have the book that mentions it, but in the comic I was reading recently a Stormtrooper was blown to tiny pieces when a stray blaster bolt hit spare power packs on her belt. Would it be fair to assume that I could tape some power packs together and shoot it from a distance for a small-scale demolition (like, perhaps, a stubborn hatch or medium-size wall?
Thanks in advance for any answers, and if this doesn't qualify as OOC and should be PM'ed directly to DA (wow, acronym much?) let me know. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Glow Rods are essentially flashlights, capable of creating a line of illumination up to 6 squares.
A simple power pack bomb can be made using 2-5 power packs and some mesh tape, and optionally also some sort of detonation device. All it takes is a few minutes of work, and a Mechanics check. The bomb is then detonated by removing the "safeties" on the packs, causing them to build a charge that eventually explodes, so I´d say shooting them is a negative. The bomb can then be placed and used as a normal explosive charge, dealing damage depending on the power packs used. Fair warning though is that these bombs are rather unstable.

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-02 01:23:45)

Good to know, and I stand warned. <!-- s8/ -->![8/](https://i.ibb.co/kVxpy8vX/icon-eek.gif)<!-- s8/ -->
So shooting them is out - by *detonation device* you mean some other piece of equipment (explosive) or will just a timer do (p.130-131 Core Rulebook)? And presumably two is enough to breach a normal hatch?
Also, it's an interesting feeling to type that you'll take 10 on a skill check if possible, but provide a dice roll as well - and have it turn up a 10. I feel... used?
~~BW
P.S. I'm going to need a price on some sort of backpack or satchel bag to carry some of these goodies, but I'll wait until tomorrow to post my shopping list.

DA -
So **Servo** is inside this topsy-turvy ship. If I've got my orientation right, the intersection he sees ahead of him would look to him like left and right if he clings to the "true floor", but in reality the "right" really goes up and the "left" really drops - have I got that right, or are we twisted back to normal? When he entered the first room:
> He had stumbled on the control for the hatch, and was currently walking on what was one of the walls of the room, which would make the very close wall on his left the actual floor of the room.

...and that's walking upright according to gravity I believe. If he simply exited that room and traveled down (which would have been "true left") then a hatch on the opposite side leading to a T-intersection would be be up and down (i.e. he could drop something down what would've been the left-hand passage). I'm confusing myself here, but I guess I suggested the whole thing in the first place. Alternately, maybe the wrecked ship has twisted back to normal orientation? Empty corridors don't much matter as far as all this goes, and I won't bother keeping track of it unless you are.

I was just trying to illustrate how the layout of the ship would be, but I guess I might have confused myself a bit in the process <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
But to clarify, I thought you were still using your magnetic feet to walk on he actual floor of the ship, and in that case it´s a left/right intersection. But yes, if you were just entering the hatch in its current layout, he intersection would be up/down, and you would currently be walking on one of the walls.

Got it. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
Yeah, I'll stick with the magnetic feet (punny?), but maybe I'll just map it out as I go, in the event gravity comes into play. And three-dimensional mapping sounds like a great way to get my geek on. I'll get a post up later on tonight, or perhaps tomorrow morning, once we all get settled in here. Incidentally - which way is the door? Is it to the "true right" or "true left"?

**1)** What would I be looking at for a DC on a 2-pack bomb to blow open that closed hatch (assuming 2 would be enough), or is there even one (p. 69, Corebook, under *Handle Explosives* seems to indicate one wouldn't be necessary, but just a little further, under *Place Explosive Device* it says a DC of 15 is appropriate)?
**2)** Is it something I could take 10 on, or do I need to set it and flee at high velocity ("these bombs are rather unstable")?
Thanks!
~~BW, who is excited to blow stuff up. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-07 16:43:12)

The DC is 15 to create the bomb, and it deals 2 dice of damage per pack used, the size of the dice determined by the type of pack used. d6 for pistol packs and d8 for rifle packs. Since all you have is a rifle, I´d say your packs would be d8s.
You could take 10 on the check I guess, but you can´t take 20. You can also use the rules for placing an explosive found in the SECR in case you want to try and increase its damage. The bomb explodes 1d6 rounds after you have manually removed the last safety on the packs, and has a 2 square blast radius.

As he walks a few meters into the he passes a closed door on his left, one labeled with a number of signs, and even if he cannot really read them, he does recognize the ones that symbolizes radiation and biohazard dangers.

I can edit my post if necessary, but this seems like the noise is **not** coming from behind the radiation/biohazard hatch. Is that correct?

I'm assuming only one round before he's in the room with me, DA? Because I have a plan but don't know if there's enough time to do it. Basically, set up her glowrod (in her utility belt) up as a diversion. Namely turned on and set on a bench or table. Somewhere pointed at the place he's coming from.

Yeah, stupid question on my part, and I apparently glazed over some details in your post.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-13 22:20:36)

Okay DA, here's Servo's **Plan B** (Plan A was "Don't Get Shot"), tell me what you think:
**Question 1:** is it reasonable to assume that Servo knows that the droideka doesn't move very fast when it's walking? I haven't looked it up myself because I'm trying to avoid metagaming. It seems like for a droid who lives on Raxus Prime he'd have at least a rudimentary understanding of different locomotive systems, and should be able to see that this thing crawls rather slow - and it's also at least several meters away from Servo I think (9 was it?) Perhaps a *Knowledge(Technology)* roll is in order, you tell me.
**Question 2:** is it also reasonable to assume that this droideka doesn't have *Darkvision*? Presumably it spotted Servo because he has a glow rod on, you wrote "Apparently spotting Servo..." so I wasn't sure.
If the answer to those questions are *yes* and *yes*, the following *may* be possible - it's your call. Even if not, it could still work. Also, I still haven't mapped anything out; maybe that makes a difference too:
**Round 1**: Move (move back into the other corridor where he came from as much as possible, not just for cover), Swift (get a Second Wind), Move (1/2 of retrieving a glow rod from his pack)
**Round 2**: Move (2/2 retrieving glow rod), Swift (activate the glow rod), Swift (deactivate the glow rod on his rifle)
**Round 3**: Swift (drop activated glow rod on the ground, facing the intersection), Move (back further into the corridor, hopefully enough into the darkness so as to gain some concealment), Swift (fall prone)
**Round 4**: Attack the droid (it may not be in sight yet, so if there's time Servo will just spend the extra rounds Recovering)
This is essentially Servo's attempt at retreating and setting up a impromptu ambush. If the droideka moves into the rolling wheel form to move it may get to the intersection quicker, but it then may be reasonable for Servo to assume it takes time (a round or standard action or whatever it is) to "unfold", and when it rolls maybe the shields aren't activated - all the better. All this depends on how fast it can follow Servo (and if it even wants to) and whether it can see in the dark. Even if it can't, the ambush could still work. A **Stealth** roll may be appropriate during Round 3. Regardless of what the droid looks like (rolling, shield up or down, etc.), once it's in range Servo will fire.
Thoughts? Sorry if this is total rubbish and not allowed and such. Replies like, "*BW - shut up and play the game!*" are entirely called for if that's the case. <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: -->
~~BW
[**Edit:**] Just to clarify - this plan seems like too much fun to pass up, and I'm not asking if I *can* as much as I'm asking *is this the way to go about it*.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-14 01:41:51)

I made a Knowledge(Technology) check for you, and it seems reasonable that Servo knows a Droideka don´t move very fast unless it´s in wheel mode, and also that its shields are deactivated when it´s rolling, and that it takes a few moments to switch between modes. Whether or not it has Darkvision is anyones guess.
I´m not going to evaluate tactics for you though, that´s not my job. As long as you do things within the rules, I´m ok. The game wouldn´t be much fun if I told you how to get past every obstacle in it, now would it?

### **Yogi** (2011-03-14 08:23:07)

We're also trying to figure out if a second job is necessary and how that will work with the store. If I could find a way to work from the laptop in the store in between customers that would be ideal, but every time I search for those sorts of things I end up looking at more scams than not. I did factory work for about two years before we opened, but that was second shift and we'd have to adjust the store hours... and the tendency for the "second job" to become the "first job" would be great. Our landlord has been pretty cool about it, but since we haven't paid rent on two spaces in her building since, well, 2010, she's getting concerned. Rightfully so. Our tax return comes in later this week (hopefully) and it pretty much goes completely to her for back-rent.
So all in all, a beautifully pensive weekend. Which is probably more than I can say for my character, since he's likely in pieces in a dark tunnel somewhere. <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: -->

May not be the weekend but right now I'm in Virginia with my mom visiting my brother and his family and my godmother. Been a nice trip so far.

I watched the **Yogscast** and I thought it was simultaneously informative and hilarious. I have to avoid games like that because I have 3 children and while I can get away with allowing them to watch a little *Minecraft* now and then, I don't think I'd want to explain fire arrows and cavalry to them. I've lost far too many hours of my life to *Civilization*, and I can only imagine I'd skip meals to play **Total War** games.
Though I guess I'm somewhat addicted to checking my e-mail for notifications from **GC**, which is nearly equally unhealthy. <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: -->

That the light side is weak. And that she is meant to be morally grey. So I'm a little disappointed that I didn't start her with some to begin with

The thing is, I was a bit more prepared for the stuff Jakira is doing while I still have a few details to iron out regarding the adventure Wes took off on. The most difficult ones are the ones that depend on how sadistic I want to be as a GM...
I´ll have something up today.

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-12 11:40:06)

Lol, okay DA - you said the timer was at **30 seconds**. I don't know how much time has passed, which is sort of why I had Servo watching it - hoping it was going to be exploding soon, if it hadn't already. Has it been longer than 30 seconds yet?

> ~~BW

Well, since Servo is a rather fast droid, and the distance was only 30 meters or so, I think it is safe to say that no, it hasn´t. 30 seconds would be 5 rounds, and Servo moves 12 squares (18 meters) on a Move action, meaning that not mattering if you used Run or double move, you´d be back on the pirate ship in one round.

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-12 12:01:31)

The jump might have been like meter or so, but it´s all covered in movement anyway.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-20 16:26:01)

Sorry Yogi, you got left out. I guess I should have read and answered a bit earlier.
Two things. First, I´m going to need you to be a little more precise when using Search your Feelings. It´s not an automatic "hint" button, and you need to at least specify some sort of question that fits the guidelines in the Core Book. Also, "Which way should we go?" is not an appropriate question in my book as it doesn´t really fall under those guidelines. Just saying for future reference.
Second, this isn´t really a place to use Search your Feelings like that. It may have been a bit unclear, but Muurak was just trying to indicate that both tunnels were clear, not that he didn´t know where to go. You´ve reached the part of the tunnel complex that runs underneath the city, but since you don´t really have any destination, there is no "right" way to go.

Ahh I missed that OOC post. My bad i guess. Sometimes a pm is a better way to notify me. I'm not always on the sight or even logged in when I am looking at the site. I'll fix it when I get a chance.
Would be nice to know if you don't like game rulings like the "which way to go" other wise I would have done something different.

I´ll try to PM in the future then.
It´s a bit hard to "warn ahead" about certain things, but I´ll try to do so when possible. Some things, like the wordings of Search your Feelings or Mind Trick, can be interpreted in many different ways, so it´s hard to know if we have the same opinions on what goes and not.

Heh, no worries. Personal tip though, as I am used to playing a lot of characters at once, is to have most of them basically just be plays of your own personality, but with different parts emphasized. It may sound limiting, but I´ve created everything between elite warrior veterans to thoughtful mystics this way.

I don´t want to make promises I can´t keep, but if I don´t oversleep tomorrow, or if the weather gets crappy enough I can´t be out and paint, they should be up tomorrow. Since I hit a standstill I took the opportunity to try and polish a bit on details of your stories.

### **BWS2K** (2011-06-26 19:16:53)

I'm not sure what needs to be more polished about a protocol droid rigged with explosives that refers to himself in the plural and is currently engaged in space piracy. I mean, that's pretty much awesome with a capital awesome, you know? So no worries on the wait for Servo, but if you happen to see **Mag** loafing around you can give him a nudge for me - I'm pretty sure I'm developing some sort of addiction to checking my e-mail every twenty minutes for an Arena update... <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

I hear ya, and I didn´t let you do a paired story to keep you apart all the time.
As for all the rest of you getting together...I´m not opposed to it happening, though at the moment...naaaah, that seems quite unlikely

### **Parmenter** (2011-06-29 22:08:58)

I'm a little sad to hear that, I was kind of looking forward to the day...

The Zann Consortium could always decide to raid whatever ship the two of them eventually get on <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> It's not completely unlikely. We just have to become accessible.

It's been over a month since the last post in Servo's thread so I'm going to officially switch him off. No hard feelings or anything, but life can be overwhelming (I know things have been exciting for me recently) and I'd rather focus on Perdition and the Arena for now. If you want to leave the thread up, DA, that's okay. Who knows what the future holds? But for the time being, please consider Servo's tale ended. Thanks for the experience though - not bad for my first ever PbP adventure I suppose. I only died once. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

Sad to hear that, though I understand you. I haven´t been the best GM lately. I´m going to update your thread along with the other tonight, and leave it be, in case you change your mind. I hope you will, since I have a good story planned ahead for you.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-07-11 08:00:58)

DA are you waiting for the others to post before moving Alicia and I along with our story? We both like this game and we're seriously wondering about the longevity of it.

No, no, update were planned for today, and it´s coming.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-29 11:17:37)

Yogi, I think you´ve got some names confused here. Muurak is the Togorian and was the one who you´ve been talking to. Tek is the Dashade who just came falling down your hole.
Will update today.

So...where is everybody?

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-08-08 18:52:34)

Okay, I'll be honest. I'm content to let Servo die an honorable death. I thought someone new was asking to join the campaign but maybe not. If you're willing to allow me to submit another character I'm willing to give it another shot. My schedule has more or less settled at work and I think I can keep up with three characters, but I don't want to be breaking any unwritten rules here. I'm just telling it like it is. **I'm totally not upset or anything and *don't* want to stir up trouble**, I'm just offering to pick up the story again. If you want we can work out a way to transfer from one character to another - we can have Servo meet someone on a raid, or Skullwire can take a prisoner that he helps escape or something - and then I'll play that other character. Maybe I can have the new character start out on Raxus Prime and be hired to find Servo? Hmmm... Actually, I think it kind of fits with the overall idea of the thread anyway - interlocking stories and all. Completely up to you though, DA, it's your show.
And, for the record, if you allow this I'll make sure to grab a utility belt *and* glow rod before heading out into any dark tunnels... <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: -->

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-08-08 20:56:30)

Well Frost did seem to have an interest, I don´t know what happened to that, but we´ll see. I´m also gonna do some more serious poking to see if Parm is still game if a post don´t come up soon.
You can by all means submit a new character if you want to, but if you want to take up Servos story again that´s cool too. If you want to make a new one, I´ll probably relegate Skullwire and his crew to the background, but who knows, maybe they´ll show up somewhere, and maybe they´ll have a certain scrap droid with them...
Having the stories interlock actually does *not* fit the idea of this game, since it was supposed to be about separate adventures <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> But, since I´m very open-minded in that manner, and there have been some expressed interest about having players come together sooner or later, pretty much anything goes <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
I guess bottom line is, if you want to submit a character, do so, and anything goes, so pick something you´d like to play without consideration to anything else.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-08-08 21:07:21)

Lol! You, sir, have a deal. I'm currently tweaking a Togorian I had in mind for Rav's Arena to see if I can make him slightly less... Arena-y? Not sure if I understand the multi-classing stuff very well. I may end up with a Noble to try something different, but we'll see. One thing I'm learning about Saga is it's hard to build a character that *isn't* based around combat until you get to later levels. Anyway, back to work. I just may have something up for you by the end of the night.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-08-08 21:21:18)

It´s actually pretty easy to build a character not focused around combat, as long as you can accept that he might happen to be useful in combat in addition to what he´s supposed to be good at =P
When you do settle though, please post it in the casting call, to keep some level of procedure intact <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

I just came off of two weeks of a fairly busy on-call and I'm home sick today. I'll have a post up today or tomorrow to keep Wes moving. Not sure what up with the others. You may want to PM Alicia I know she was having problems figuring out where to go/what to do next. I think Jakira is feeling a little "lost".

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-09-04 16:15:42)

Hey guys...were is everybody? It´s been quite a while since someone posted here...
I haven´t seen anything from Alicia in her game threads, so I can only assume that she is still having some computer troubles, but where are you Yogi?
Parm, I see you online all day, but it´s been ages since you posted, so I´m sorry, but I´ll be offering up your slot for new players, unless I see some improvement.

---

### **Yogi** (2011-09-04 17:34:24)

Hey DA. Sorry that I haven't posted I am hoping to do that this evening after the girls go to bed.
As for Alicia I'm not sure what's going on. Yeah she did mention her computer problem (her tower) but she also has a laptop, iPad, iPhone so I'm not sure why she hasn't posted. I could be her realitivly new boyfriend has been occupying her attention. Not sure though.

### **BWS2K** (2011-09-04 18:32:07)

I did happen to catch her on chat a few days ago. Regarding the *Perdition* campaign I believe she said "I'm trying to figure out what to do with that." It sounded like she's just having trouble getting her head back in the game. I'm not sure about anywhere else. It's been really quiet on the site lately. So much so that I'm seriously toying with putting out another interest check...
My Felucian character is as updated as I can make him DA, but I'm in no hurry. I remember when I joined there was almost always someone in the chat and there were plenty of updates all over but now not so much. I think life has just been fairly hectic in the states lately. I know Mag was out for a while with the tornadoes, then we had the hurricane, now it looks like there's a bit of flooding. Crazy.

It's back to school time here, kids go back on Wednesday. Work has been busy. I know that Alicia is was having problems "getting into the game". That and she felt that the skill challenge didn't seem to be going anywhere. That was my understanding of it anyways then again that that was a couple of months ago.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-09-05 18:34:45)

Yeah, I do think the Skill Challenge went a little worse than I had hoped, but I´m hoping that now that you´re back together you might do better. And if you shouldn´t, I´ll probably deal with it anyway. I still feel pretty rookie as a GM, so mistakes like that might happen. I need to get some combat in to get me all fired up <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->

I´m kind of torn between how to do in these situations, either I could move the game along on my own, or I could wait until both of you post. I´m feeling like the former isn´t really helping in the long run, what do you think?
@BW - Post coming

@DA - looking forward to it. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
I'd like to swap out Weapon Proficiency (rifles) or (pistols) for the Armor Proficiency of whatever it is Servo ends up with. He currently has just a blaster pistol, but I wonder if, in the long run, proficiency with rifles is worth more to keep. I don't think it matters much to take the penalty with the pistol if it means he can get a lovely blaster rifle of some sort later. It's your call which one, but losing Improved Defenses seems like two steps forward, one step back if it's to gain proficiency in armor and I'd like to keep it.

So, it´s been five days...still planning on making that post? I´ve been a little busy, which is why I haven´t done so much, but if you´re not feeling up for it, perhaps there´s no point in going on.

**@BW** - Sorry for the delay, I didn´t realize days flies by this fast.
**@Alicia/Yogi** - How are you doing? I get the feeling you aren´t quite "in" the game at the moment. I´ve been waiting for responses from you for a while now, though I should probably have moved things on earlier. I´m hoping you want to keep going, and I was thinking that maybe a little action will help you get back in the mood.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-03 16:42:48)

.................................(speechless)
I did *not* spend the better part of my afternoon writing that post to roll a ***natural one***. I **reject** it.
I don't know how skill checks work either, the only one I've ever had was when Alicia was crashing us in that ship - is that what you were looking for?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-05 21:32:04)

I sincerely hope you mean you don´t know how Skill *Challenges* works, otherwise you should really go back to reading up on the basics of this game...
But anyway, the basic structure of a Skill Challenge is that you need to acquire a number of successes before reaching 3 failures, using various skills in ways that you see fit. In case you get stuck, I will typically have a set of suggested skills to use, but I want to promote creativity. While skills are the primary focus, if you feel like a specific talent or other ability (including attack rolls, Force powers, etc) might be appropriate, you can use that instead, perhaps even earning an automatic success without the need for a roll. For example, the Gambler talent could possibly warrant an automatic success in a Skill Challenge representing a game of pazaak. I have a guide for them floating around somewhere, I´ll see about adding it to my "Guidelines" section.
One thing though. While I appreciate your creativity and roleplaying, remember that you only need to tell me what you want to do, and then it´s my job to tell you how it went. For example - and this is why it´s taking some time - given your extensive descriptions, I have a hard time figuring out exactly how you failed. And yes, you failed, natural 1s tend to do that... <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

---

### **chiech22** (2011-12-05 22:36:29)

I was wondering if you could provide me with a description of Karka. Vree should know what he looks like and I don't want to clog up the thread or make assumptions that you need to correct later.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-05 22:47:10)

> **DarthAnthrax wrote:**
>
> You can expect whatever you wish, I´ll hopefully not be doing it. But anyway, this will be a Skill Challenge. That´s about all the information I´m giving you, the rest is up to you. Your objective, however, is to assist in the calibration of the sensor arrays. At least that´s your current objective&#8230;

So I figured that meant I could just make it all up. It obviously doesn't have to *work*, but I didn't get the impression that it mattered much what kind of crazy sensor parts I interacted with. I tend to get a little whiny when I roll a **one**, I'm working on that. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
As far as skill challenges go - I get the concept, I just didn't know if there were any nuances I wouldn't have known. For instance: When we were all crashing in that ship in Alicia's game she literally said "**You're crashing, roll once for any skill you want to use to save the ship.**" That's pretty specific. You said "**Calibrate the sensor array.**" Clearly *Servo* would know the specifics, but I'm afraid *BW* is a bit rusty on his starship systems refinement... so I made it up.

Pick something, it doesn't bother me. Maybe the **YV** setting actually stands for **Yellow Vehicles**. Oops. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
How many rolls are we going for here? I can lump them all in one post if you like, or edit in some more...?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-06 09:14:40)

I try to keep the info to a minimum, not to stifle creativity or give away too much. And yes, that means you can pretty much make stuff up as you go, as you think of various ways to use your skills. For example, using Mechanics to try and perform physical adjustments on the actual sensor arrays themselves would seem a good idea. However, in this case you provided me both with information on what you wanted to do, as well as *pretty much the actual resolution of what you did*. While Skill Challenges has a few special rules of their own, it still works like a normal skill check or attack roll: You tell me what you want to attempt and makes the check, and then I´ll compare it against a DC or Reflex Defense and tell you how it went. And in the case any Skill Challenge specific rules are in place that you need to know about (mainly if they involve a choice on your part), I´ll let you know.
You don´t have to edit anything, I just wanted to point these things out. It doesn´t ruin the game in any way, but it feels kind of odd when you provides both the attempted action and the solution. Also, it will force me to be more creative in figuring out why you fail in the cases that you do. And in the case that you have described the alignments pretty much as complete, I have no choice but to say that Servo screwed up by loading the wrong program or adjusted the wrong dish. Meaning that if you want it to be possible that any failures on your part could come from an accident, outside interference, or Murphy´s Law, you´ll leave most of the resolution descriptions to me, or I have a feeling Servo will start to look really incompetent really soon <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> (And yes, this will happen in my response post, be assured of that...a natural one needs to be felt <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> )
The number of rolls varies on how many successes you need to complete the challenge, but I want to keep the actual number a secret, since it is possible I might have plans for something to happen after you reach a certain amount of successes. Also there is a possibility that a success with a certain skill might open up new options, which you will kind of miss out on if you make all the checks at once. So my preference would be that you keep the skill checks to one per post, but also remember that not all posts have to actively contribute to the challenge. Also, you can make skill checks not related to the challenge to gain additional info that won´t count against your successes and failures.
That became quite long, but I´ll try to get my guide to Skill Challenges up for future reference. Finally, I´d like you to edit in a Use Computer check in your post, since I feel that all your computer fiddling would call for one.

He looks pretty much like you typical Bothan, with long black hair with some grey/white strings in it, kind of like Talon Karrde. He also has a clean-shaven face, and his fur falls in a light hue, in contrast to his dark hair.

Great! Thanks for that. As a follow up, what else does Vree know about Karka's reasons for being on Dantooine? Does he know who he is with, does he know possible contacts? What kind of ship does Karka usually fly? Trying to be more intelligent in my ICC. I should make a post soon.

I hear that. Thanks for posting this weekend. As it gets closer I will try to stay as current as possible.
On a game related note, I am trying a dice roll for the first time. I am going to practice here so you don't have to edit my post.
[Dice roll 0 data not found]

[Dice roll 120 data not found]

### **chiech22** (2011-12-11 16:21:30)

***1*** <- [1] 1d20

---

### **chiech22** (2011-12-11 16:22:48)

***6*** <- [7] 1d20 + ()+6

---

### **chiech22** (2011-12-11 16:27:13)

So I got 2 1s in a row, and looking at other threads BWS2K got a 1 one his last roll. Is there something that I am doing wrong?
In between the dice [] I typed 1d20 and then +6, so it looks like "dice 1d20+6 /dice" (with the brackets) to make a +6 skill check - correct.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-11 16:42:44)

***26*** <- [20] 1d20 + 6

No you´re not making anything wrong, though that last roll where you got a total of 6 when rolling 1d20+6 seems a bit odd...have you tampered with it? Also, you shouldn´t use any parenthesis, might be that.
The dice roller is just like that, it has turned to the Dark Side...
Anyway, when you make a skill check in the game, please indicate what you are using it for. For example, I can see no apparent use of Knowledge(Tactics) in your current situation, so it would be nice to know what you were going for.

---

### **chiech22** (2011-12-11 17:34:22)

I did not use the () just trying to indicate what I was doing without using the correct characters. I did not edit or tamper with anything so I am not sure if something is wrong. Thank you for helping me though <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
As for my Tactics check, that comes from the Clone War source book page 27, anticipate enemy strategy.
I am going to post my roll. Without quotes in between the dice prompts I am going to type
1d20+6
Hope it works.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-12-11 17:54:00)

I just noticed that when your post displayed what you had rolled, it said (1d20)+6, but mine said 1d20+6, so I figured you might have put (1d20)+6 between the parentheses. It just seemed weird that you had gotten a result of 6, when the dice roll showed 7, and the minimum possible result from 1d20+6 should be 7...but anyway it seems to work now. And just as a future heads-up, it does not work to roll multiple dice inside the same roll, such as 1d20+1d6, you´ll have to make two rolls.
Oh, and you should really see someone about your paranoia...

I'll probably take my chances with a **Strength** check to pull it loose, but I think I know what you mean. I'm assuming I can't be taking 10 during a skill check...?

@chiech - Two reminders regarding Use the Force:

* Sense Surroundings in itself really does nothing for you on its own. In order to take use of it, you need to make a Perception check as well. Just using Sense Surroundings will allow you to ignore cover/concealment on Perception checks made as reactions only.
* When using Search your Feelings you need to specify some sort of action you are trying to "feel" the consequences of, it´s not a "GM Hint" skill.

I´ll give you a chance to edit your post before moving on.

If you plan on using comlinks, then yes, that would be required.

---

### **chiech22** (2012-02-29 18:44:16)

If I could briefly explain the Knowledge Biology check - if I made a successful check then I though that the party would get some sort of special modifier like instead of a 20% chance of running into the kath hounds, it would go down to 10% because of the knowledge informing the route decisions.
Also,if his thoughts about the Kath already eaten so they are less aggressive it might take their CL down a step or something like that.
Regardless, as the GM it is your game so you can do whatever you want. Probably should have asked before I posted like that, but in character, that is something that I thought Vree would do/say.
I don't expect you to respond and say yes or no one way or the other, i.e. I am not trying to metagame with this.
No worries whatever you want to do. Hope you are still enjoying the game as much as I am. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-02-29 20:18:10)

Well, I would always like you to explain what your checks are for in the post where they are made. Simply putting out a roll, even if you name a specific skill, doesn´t help me a lot. Or to make it simple, if you put out a roll labeled "Attack Roll", I´d still expect you to mention what you are attacking.
On the issue of circumstance bonuses, I will apply them when I feel necessary, though I most likely won´t bother to tell you. So never assume that you have any kind of favorable circumstances when making rolls, if I think they are merited, I will apply the bonuses to your roll. For example, if you are trying to sneak past someone, and there is a massive light source between you, don´t include any bonus in your post, even though it is reasonable to assume the light makes it harder for him to spot you. There may be things you are not aware of that negates this benefit (the guy might be wearing light-dampening goggles), or I just might not find it appropriate enough to warrant a bonus.
Or to clarify using your examples, your first suggestion would only make sense if you actually had some way of knowing if the tunnels you are headed into would be of the kind that the Kath prefer so you can know to avoid them. Same with your second suggestion, why would Vree knowing Kath are less aggressive after eating have any effect on potential Kath encounters? That would mean that your successful check somehow made certain that all Kath in the area have just eaten...see my point?

---

### **chiech22** (2012-02-29 21:21:54)

Since you put it that way, what you are saying makes a lot of sense. Vree would have still tried to be a know it all so I'll keep the comments. Your choice whether to delete the check or not.
Since we have come to a 4-way intersection, would this be an appropriate time for a UTF check once I have picked a direction? ie I choose the west path, UTF check Search Your feelings. I know that it will not lead me to the correct path, but might keep us from turning into a nest of Kath hounds right away. Am I reading the skill right?
Not to Zork this encounter up, but could I get a brief description of where things are orientated? ie so the Enclave is due south, the cave opening went east ... I don't want to make it cumbersome but since I am picking paths, a general direction would help.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-02 01:07:00)

That would be an appropriate way to use Search your Feelings, yes.
The general sense of directions here would be that the Enclave ruins would be to the north, and you have been traveling in a north-northeast direction.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-03-21 18:31:55)

Sorry about the slow answer, I´ve been a bit busy.
I just now realized it was formatted a bit odd (ok, really bad...), so I put it in a code tag to hopefully make more sense. If you still have trouble interpreting it, just tell me. Basically it is just an outline of the corridors of the vicinity, and the cells marked out.

### **chiech22** (2012-04-13 06:46:15)

No worries. Wow! Way to amp the game up 1000%. Quick questions: how far away am I form the Fake Karka? I am standing up right?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-04-13 08:03:37)

The room is a little more than 6 squares in radius, but you are about 6 squares away from Karka, Jorgan has backed up and is another square away. And yes, you are standing, since the game does only discern between "standing" and "prone", and you are not prone.

Hey DA,
Hope your school exams are going well. I too am busy in RL, but I will get back to posting regularly next week. Just some book keeping questions - did my last attack happen or did Jorgan kill the creature? Just need to make sure that I take off enough FPs.
Thanks,
Chiech

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-06 20:54:36)

Well, the exams all went south, so now I know what I´m doing this summer...still I think I might have some good lead on a thesis work, so not all things are looking bad.
Good catch actually, since in fact you didn´t have to spend the Force Point, or even make the attack at all. Jorgans attack was a crit, but I added in the description of your attack anyway, since it felt appropriate. But no, you don´t have to spend the Force Point.

---

### **chiech22** (2012-06-18 07:54:15)

Sorry about the lack of posting. I should be back to normal in a week or two. Just a few housekeeping items, I lost a total of 22 HP so I now have 41 (63-22), and I spent 2 of 7 force points since the last attack did not happen. Correct? Also, do we keep track of xp or anything like that?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2012-06-19 00:36:35)

That sounds correct. You don´t have to keep track of XP, I´ll do that for you.
@jaybee - Hey man, what´s up? Checking your PMs lately? I sent you on about how to proceed, so please answer.
